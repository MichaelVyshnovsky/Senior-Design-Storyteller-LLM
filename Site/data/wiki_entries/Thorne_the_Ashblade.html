<h2>Character Name: Thorne the Ashblade</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Thorne the Ashblade was once a skilled blacksmith in the Cindermarch Wastes, crafting weapons and armor with fire and steel. His life took a tragic turn when a volcanic eruption struck his town, bonds of flames binding his soul to an ancient flame blade. Now, Thorne wields both physical and magical heat, his every strike infuse with the raw power of fire. Ash and smoke trail from his blows, reflecting his inner turmoil and connection to the spirit world. Despite his fiery passion, he remains fiercely loyal to those he Trusts and haunted by the memories of lost love and ancient spirits.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

  <li><strong>Enemies:</strong> The Glass Regent (a Pyro Domiress with greater control over fire) and Frostbane Legion (an icy enemy bent on destroying Thorne's world). Thorne views these foes as obstacles he must overcome to protect those he loves.</li></ul>

<h3>Personality</h3>
<p>Thorne is fiercely loyal, driven by his deep connection to fire and the people he cherishes. He is passionate, impatient, and often irritable when his loved ones are threatened. Despite his fiery nature, he is compassionate and protective of those he cares about, even if their actions occasionally drive him crazy. Thorne thrives in conflict but struggles with the weight of his past and the expectations placed upon him by his new life as a Bladebound Pyromancer.</p>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Thorne has long, fiery-red hair that reflects the light like molten lava. His skin is tanned from years spent outdoors, though he wears simple flame-colored leather armor adorned with symbols of fire. A scar runs across his cheekbone from the volcanic eruption that forged his soul into a flame blade. His eyes are a fiery orange, and his belt holds an ancient flame blade that glows with an inner fire.</p>

<h3>Faction Role</h3>
<p>Thorne is a member of the Emberborn Oath, a faction of Bladebound Pyromancers who swear allegiance to the Arcane Flame King. However, he often defies their orders when protecting his friends and family from greater threats, maintaining his individuality even within the bounds of the Oath. Thorne refuses to bond with higher bonds unless absolutely necessary, as he values his connection to fire above all else.</p></div>
