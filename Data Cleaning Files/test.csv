Arcanechambers.jpg,,The Arcane Chambers,[[Undermountain]],2,,"[[Waterdeep]], [[Sword Coast North]]",,,,,[[Dungeon Level]],[[Sargauth Level]],"The '''Arcane Chambers''' made up the second level of [[Undermountain]]. It used to serve as a laboratory for [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s apprentices, and was thus infested with sentient magical experiments and other leftovers.",The Hall of the Black Helm was a 80-feet (24 meters) high dark room. It was once decorated with tapestries of armored [[Pegasus|pegasi]]-riders hunting [[dragon]]s. It was also the destination of a ''gate'' in a room from the [[Dungeon Level]].,People who passed the ''Ghost Gate'' entered the center of the Helmwatch-room.,"Lord Hund's Tomb was not a single room, but an entire complex that was not created by Halaster, but by people hired by Lord [[Hund Hiilgauntlet]], a [[necromancer]] who eventually became a [[mummy]].","Pillars of the Society was a 10-feet (6 meters) high warm room. It was illuminated by a green-white glowing mold. The entire room smelled like yeast and it had two pillars. One of them was plain, the other had cracks or other irregularities. The former was warm and Halaster enchanted it so that organic material that touched it were glued to it for about five hours, the victim effectively being at the mercy of whatever monster comes across.",Halaster built a number of [[magic]]al entrances and exits in this level.,The ''Ghost Gate'' was a one-way ''[[portal|gate]]''. It led to the Helmwatch-room.,"The following ways could be used to leave the Arcane Chambers:
* An Archgate in the northern part of this level connected it to an eastern cavern on Level 4.
* An Archgate in the western part of this level connected it to a house in the center of Level 5.
* An Archgate in the south-west part of this level connected it to a chamber in the east of Level 6.
* The so-called Doomgate connected the [[Carnelian Cavern]] on the Sargauth Level with the [[Chamber of the Fallen]].
* There was also the Old Xoblob Gate that linked the [[Old Xoblob Shop]] in Waterdeep with the [[Cloaker's Chest]] in the Arcane Chambers.",The [[Rustbone]] tribe of [[goblins]] secured a large complex of chambers in the north of this level. It was a bazaar by [[1493 DR]]. There were rumors it was originally a throne room.,"Unlike the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]'s goals for the [[Dungeon Level]], the representatives on this level would rather plunder it and sell the takings in [[Skullport]] to help their horrid economy. Around 1493 DR, they had two watch posts on this level, one commanded by [[Shunn Shurreth|Shunn ""Spider Eyes"" Shurreth]], a [[drow]], and [[Nadia the Unbent]], a [[human]] [[berserker]].",A drow mage allied with the [[Zhentarim]] had a hidden base in the center of this level around 1493 DR.
