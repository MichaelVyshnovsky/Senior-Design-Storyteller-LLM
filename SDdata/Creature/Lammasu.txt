}}A '''lammasu''' ({{Pronounce|LA|ma|soo|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was a noble and stern magical beast that looked like a cross between a [[lion]] and an [[eagle]]. Lammasus sought to promote goodness throughout the world, living in isolated ruins and abandoned temples.

==Description==
A lammasu had the body of a [[lion]], the wings of a giant [[eagle]], and the face of a [[human]]. They were capable of flight.

The average lammasu measured {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in length and weighed about {{SI|500|lb|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Lammasus were creatures who preferred isolation but concerned themselves with the well-being of good creatures in general. Their outwardly stern demeanor belied their capacity for compassion. They were cordial in nature towards other [[good]] creatures and were often willing to assist them in combating [[evil]]. According to some they would attack evil creatures on sight, while others gave evil creatures a chance to leave their lairs, firmly asking them to go.

==Ability==
[[File:Lammasu 2e.png|thumb|''A lammasu in all its magnificence.'']]
According to early scholars, all lammasu possessed an innate ability to turn themselves invisible and ''[[dimension door]]'' at will. Their bodies also radiated an aura similar to the [[spell]] ''[[protection from evil, 10' radius]]''. However, later scholars claimed that a lammasu was limited to using ''[[greater invisibility]]'' on itself up to twice per day and ''dimension door'' once per day. They also possessed a limited form of telepathy.

Lammasu could cast [[divine magic]], including spells from the [[good domain|good]], [[healing domain|healing]], [[knowledge domain|knowledge]], and [[law domain|law]] domains. All lammasu knew the spells ''[[cure critical wounds]]'' and ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', whilst only a small percentage of them knew the spell ''[[holy word]]''.

==Combat==
Beyond their use of priestly spells, lammasu fought by use of their sharp front claws. In some circumstances, they would use their telepathy to communicate with nearby lammasu to ask for aid.

==Sub-Species==
;Greater lammasu: Slightly larger than the common lammasu, these creatures possessed a greater array of abilities. They had the power to ''[[teleport without error]]'' at will, as well as the power to travel the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] and [[Ethereal plane|Ethereal]] [[plane]]s. Additionally, their ''protection from aura'' radiated out to {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}, over 50 percent of them knew ''holy word'', and they possessed the [[psionic]] powers ''[[Empathy (psionic)|empathy]]'' and ''[[telepathic communication]]''.

==Society==
Lammasu organized themselves in prides, much like lions. Their societies were very structured, reflective of their [[lawful good]] nature, and lead by one or two greater lammasu. They worked to keep down the population of evil creatures in their area, often protecting frontier settlements.

Once a month, on the night of a full moon, all pride leaders within a given area would meet up in an event called "the Whitemoon". There they would discuss until dawn how their ongoing efforts to combat evil were going. According to many accounts, their collective presence would cause a bright glow to emanate from their meeting spot.
===Habitats===
Lammasu were commonly found on the [[Prime Material]] within temperate and warm climates, such as in deserts, where they made their homes in old abandoned temples that they considered themselves to be the guardians of. Their communities were always spread out from each other at a distance of {{SI|25|mile|long=yes}}.

In the [[Gulthmere Forest]], lammasu could be found living on the [[Machran Spire]] most of the year.

Beyond the Prime Material, lammasu were most commonly found in [[Mount Celestia]],<ref> the [[divine realm]] of the [[Pridelands]] in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], and in the divine realm of [[Merratet]], wherein existed a whole village of lammasu. Additionally, both lesser and greater lammasu could also be found within the Ethereal Plane, though only the latter could be encountered in the Astral.<ref>

===Languages===
In addition to speaking [[Lammasu language|their own language]], lammasu commonly spoke the [[Common Tongue]], [[Celestial language|Celestial]], and [[Draconic language|Draconic]]. Greater lammasu additionally knew how to speak the limited [[Alignment languages|lawful good tongue]].
===Relationships===
These creatures generally harbored a strong emnity towards [[lamia]]s and [[manticore]]s, the latter especially as it was not uncommon for those less familiar with lammasu to misidentify them as being manticores.

They served as [[favored monster|servants]] for a variety of different [[deities]] across the Realms, including [[Arvoreen]],<ref> [[Cyrrollalee]],<ref> [[Horus-Re]],<ref> [[Isis]],<ref> [[Osiris]],<ref> [[Solonor Thelandira]],<ref> [[Torm]],<ref> and [[Yondalla]].<ref> They were most strongly associated with [[Nobanion]], who was sometimes depicted as a lammasu himself and whose church considered both lesser and greater lammasu to be members of the clergy.
===Usage===
A tuft of fur from a lammasu was required as a [[material component]] for the [[Nobanionite]] spell ''[[Lionheart (Nobanionite spell)|lionheart]]''.<ref>

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-30700}}, a number of lammasu defeated a much larger force of [[Aearee-Krocaa]], killing one thousand.
