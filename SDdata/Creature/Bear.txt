{{quote|If you want to know what berries are good to eat, you can't always rely on the [[bird]]s because birds can eat [[poison]]ous berries, but people can usually eat what the bears eat. Bears also know how to dig for roots. If you're not sure about eating something, you should find a bear. But be sure the bear doesn't find you.|[[Emilo Haversack]]}}

Bears could be most often found in forested regions or caverns.

In [[north Faerûn]], a breed of bear known as the black-masked bear was commonplace throughout the forests of [[the Vast]]. It was also commonplace on the tables of local inns, as a well-roasted dish<ref> and as an ingredient in [[wildsage stew]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}

Beyond [[Faerûn]] they could be found in [[Evermeet]], where they were non-hostile towards elves and occasionally hunted by [[gold elves]]. In the [[Hordelands]], they could be found at the lowest levels of the [[Katakoro Plateau]].

===Relationships===
Bears were a [[favored animal]] of several deities, including [[Bahgtru]], [[Eldath]], [[Geb]], [[Malar]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], and [[Solonor Thelandira]].
