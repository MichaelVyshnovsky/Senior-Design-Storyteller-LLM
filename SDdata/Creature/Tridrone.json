        "mainbody": "'''Tridrones''' were an intermediate type of [[modron]].",
        "Description": "Tridrones were shaped like inverted tetrahedrons and were capable of performing three tasks at a time.",
        "Personality": "Like all modrons, tridrones had an absolute sense of hierarchy and order, and could not be persuaded to disobey their instructions or betray their purpose in any way.\n\nIt was possible, however, for a defective tridrone to go rogue and start acting in its own interests or no longer in accordance with its instructions, sometimes even becoming violent. Such rogues were relentlessly hunted by other modrons, although, unlike their properly operating fellows, they could be reasoned with.",
        "Biology": "In addition to their [[True seeing|truesight]], tridrones were capable of seeing the [[Infravision|infrared]] and [[Ultravision|ultraviolet spectrums]] out to {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} and {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}}, respectively.",
        "Abilities": "Like all modrons, tridrones were immune to all effects and spells that influenced the mind, fear and attacks that rely on energy from either the [[Negative Energy plane|Negative]] or [[Positive Energy plane|Positive]] energy planes. They also had a resistance to acid, cold and [[fire]].",
        "Combat": "Tridrones were capable of wielding weapons and were competent combatants, capable of performing three attacks at a time. If destroyed, a tridrone disintegrated completely into dust and a [[duodrone]] was instantly upgraded into a tridrone to fill its position. One of the weapons most commonly wielded by them were [[javelin]]s, which they would hurl at their foes before closing.",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 1480s [[DR]], a tridrone leading a group of [[monodrone]]s was stranded in the [[Labyrinth]] in the [[Underdark]], separated from the other modrons since the previous [[Great Modron March]], over two centuries earlier. After years of wandering, the tridrone managed to keep the group together, but felt responsible for its failure in performing their assigned task.",
        "Society": "Tridrones could communicate with other tridrones and with [[duodrone]]s and [[quadrone]]s. They were incapable of communicating directly with [[monodrone]]s and could not comprehend the more advanced [[pentadrone]]s.\n\nIn modron society, tridrones were responsible for leading groups of lesser modrons into battle. They were always created as the result of upgraded duodrones to take the place of destroyed units. \n\nThere were about six million tridrones in modron society."
