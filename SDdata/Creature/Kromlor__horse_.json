        "mainbody": "The Kromlor was a massive workhorse, often using for farming, mining or other intensive labor in west Faer√ªn from the Sword Coast up to the North. They were particularly popular in Baldurs Gate.\nFamous for their massive size, but hard-working personality, the Kromlor was a magnificent specimen of a horse. They sold for as high as 1,000 gp.\nAccording to some historians, the Kromlor was the result of breeding the Nars and Chionthar.\nThis horse took its name after the famed Kromlor family of Longsaddle, some of the first pioneers to settle in the harsh Savage Frontier."
