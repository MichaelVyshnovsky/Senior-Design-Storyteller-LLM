The '''ferret''' was a common animal in the Realms, related to [[weasel]]s.{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|17}}{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|17}}

==Description==
Like weasels, these animals were small and furry creatures, measuring {{SIrange|1|2|ft|long=yes}} in length from head to tail.

==Behavior==
Ferrets could be extremely aggressive but chose to attack smaller prey.

==Species==
===Semberholme===
The Semberholme ferret was found in the [[Semberholme]] area of the [[Cormanthor]] forest. It was characterized by its color-changing fur, which was normally brown but became white in the winter to provide extra camouflage against [[wolves]].
===Swamp===
The swamp ferret was found in the swamps of the [[High Moor]]. Their bodies typically grew to a length of {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} and had deep brown fur with gray or green markings. They were excellent swimmers, as well as a rather cunning and quite vicious species, even by ferret standards. They were unafraid to attack even mammals that were larger than themselves&mdash;[[Elminster]] had once heard of a small group of swamp ferrets taking down a full-grown [[goblin]]. However, they were primarily known to eat young [[rabbit]]s and [[rat]]s. They made their nests inside of small trees, usually close to other nests.

==Ecology==
Much like [[stoat]]s, the fur pelt of a ferret was not considered to be very valuable.
===Habitats===
Beyond [[Toril]], ferrets could be found on the planet [[Garden]].
===Relationships===
Some [[wizard]]s were known to have them as [[familiar]]s.
