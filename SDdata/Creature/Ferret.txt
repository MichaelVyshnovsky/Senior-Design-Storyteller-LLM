The ferret was a common animal in the Realms, related to weasels.
Like weasels, these animals were small and furry creatures, measuring  in length from head to tail.
Ferrets could be extremely aggressive but chose to attack smaller prey.
The Semberholme ferret was found in the Semberholme area of the Cormanthor forest. It was characterized by its color-changing fur, which was normally brown but became white in the winter to provide extra camouflage against wolves.
The swamp ferret was found in the swamps of the High Moor. Their bodies typically grew to a length of  and had deep brown fur with gray or green markings. They were excellent swimmers, as well as a rather cunning and quite vicious species, even by ferret standards. They were unafraid to attack even mammals that were larger than themselves&mdashElminster had once heard of a small group of swamp ferrets taking down a full-grown goblin. However, they were primarily known to eat young rabbits and rats. They made their nests inside of small trees, usually close to other nests.
Much like stoats, the fur pelt of a ferret was not considered to be very valuable.
Beyond Toril, ferrets could be found on the planet Garden.
Some wizards were known to have them as familiars.
