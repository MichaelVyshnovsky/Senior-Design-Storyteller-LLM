 Queen A formian queen was about t long and  tall. She weighed about  and was unable to move, relying on her control of her hive mind to guard her.
Formians were dedicated to spreading their colonies wherever they could. Colonies, also called "hive-cities," consisted of a ruling queen and different hierarchies of workers, from worker (lowest) to taskmaskers, from warriors to myrmarchs (highest below the queen). Formians had a hive mind based on the queen any formian within  of a queen could communicate telepathically with any other formian within that range. The most prestigious of myrmarchs was responsible for guarding the queen. These colonies are prevalant throughout both Mechanus and Arcadia
