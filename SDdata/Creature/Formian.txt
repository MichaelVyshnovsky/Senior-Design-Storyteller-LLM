'''Formians''' ({{Pronounce|FOR|mee|unz|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) also known as "Ant-Centaurs" were an ant-like race of [[outsider]]s.

==Description==
Formians were brown and resembled a cross between an ant and a [[centaur]]. Their size and appearance otherwise depended on the rank they were born into:

; Worker: Formian workers were about {{SI|3|ft}} long and {{SI|2.5|ft}} tall and weighed around {{SI|60|lb}}. They could not speak.

; Taskmaster: Formian taskmasters were about {{SI|5|ft}} long and {{SI|4.5|ft}} feet tall and weighed about {{SI|150|lb}}. They had neither mandible nor mouth, instead relying on the energy of controlled creatures to sustain them. They were unable to speak.

; Warrior: Like taskmasters, formian warriors were {{SI|5|ft}} long and {{SI|4.5|ft}} tall and weighed about {{SI|150|lb}}. They had sharp mandibles and poison stingers.

; Myrmarch: Formian myrmarchs were {{SI|7|ft}} long and {{SI|5.5|ft}} feet tall and weighed about {{SI|1500|lb}}. They had hands rather than claws. They could speak [[Formian (language)|Formian]] and [[Common]].

; Queen: A formian queen was about {{SI|10|ft}}t long and {{SI|4|ft}} tall. She weighed about {{SI|3500|lb}} and was unable to move, relying on her control of her hive mind to guard her.

==Society==
Formians were dedicated to spreading their colonies wherever they could. Colonies, also called "hive-cities," consisted of a ruling queen and different hierarchies of workers, from worker (lowest) to taskmaskers, from warriors to myrmarchs (highest below the queen). Formians had a hive mind based on the queen; any formian within {{SI|50|mi|k}} of a queen could communicate telepathically with any other formian within that range. The most prestigious of myrmarchs was responsible for guarding the queen. These colonies are prevalant throughout both [[Mechanus]] and [[Arcadia]]

==Combat==

Colonies relied on their warriors' fighting abilities to defend the hive. Myrmarchs and taskmasters were also proficient fighters and had limited spell-like abilities, such as ''[[dominate monster]]'' or ''[[charm monster]]''.

The queen had no ability to move, but she could cast spells in defense of her hive and had a number of spell-like abilities, such as ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[shield of law]]'', and ''[[true seeing]]''.
