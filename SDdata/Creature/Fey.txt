Fey were creatures from the Feywild, a parallel plane to the Prime, the Feywild was also called the Plane of Faerie. Many were typified as having supernatural abilities and a connection to nature or to some other force or place. The language of the fey was called Sylvan.
Many were typically humanoid in shape.
The darkest and most powerful legend about fey went back eons, to the creator races. Some sages claimed that fey creatures known as the leShay were one of the four, possibly five, creator races.
There were many different species of fey, and connections between them could be hard to identify, other than being natives of the Feywild. A few common threads could be drawn between certain smaller groups, however, while some were simply impossible to classify.
Some fey were strongly bound or associated with specific natural locations such as water bodies, landmarks, or other geographical features. These included dryads, hamadryads, nymphs, naiads, nereids, oreads, and fossergrim.
Other fey were reported as being born from emotions felt while in the Feywild, manifested due to that planes strange energy. Redcaps, meenlocks, boggles,
Another group that was easily identified were the hags annises, bheur hags, sea hags, green hags, shrieking hags, and bog hags were all considered. Night hags, although related, were actually fiends.
One group of fey was confusingly called sprites, despite this being a specific name for one of its included members. All "sprites" were small, mostly humanoid fey, that typically displayed some insect-like attributes (such as wings). Besides the classical sprite for which the group was named, there were the sea sprites, shrub sprites, the light makers of Chult, grigs, nixies, pixies, The winterling, despite also being small and winged, was not included. Conversely, the sakina of Zakhara were considered "sprites", despite not exhibiting any of the typical features of one.
Yet another diverse group of minuscule fey were the gremlins, who descended from goblins transformed by fomorian rituals. They included the fremlin, galltrit, jermlaine, snyad, and the plainsjan that inhabited the planet Anadia in Realmspace. Mites were also considered by some to be members of this group.
Of course, many fey could not be classified into any larger group beyond being related to either nature or emotion. These included
