'''Fey''' were creatures from the [[Feywild]], a [[parallel plane]] to the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]], the Feywild was also called the Plane of Faerie. Many were typified as having supernatural abilities and a connection to nature or to some other force or place. The language of the fey was called [[Sylvan]].

==Description==
Many were typically [[humanoid]] in shape.

==Legends==
The darkest and most powerful legend about fey went back eons, to the [[creator race]]s. Some sages claimed that fey creatures known as the [[leShay]] were one of the four, possibly five, creator races.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal}}

==Species of Fey==
There were many different species of fey, and connections between them could be hard to identify, other than being natives of the Feywild. A few common threads could be drawn between certain smaller groups, however, while some were simply impossible to classify.{{speculation}}

Some fey were strongly bound or associated with specific natural locations such as water bodies, landmarks, or other geographical features. These included [[dryad]]s, [[hamadryad]]s, [[nymph]]s, [[naiad]]s, [[nereid]]s, [[oread]]s, and [[fossergrim]].{{speculation}}

Other fey were reported as being born from emotions felt while in the Feywild, manifested due to that plane's strange energy. [[Redcap]]s, [[meenlock]]s, [[boggle]]s,

Another group that was easily identified were the [[hag]]s: [[annis]]es, [[bheur hag]]s, [[sea hag]]s, [[green hag]]s, [[shrieking hag]]s, and [[bog hag]]s were all considered. [[Night hag]]s, although related, were actually [[fiend]]s.

One group of fey was confusingly called [[Sprite (classification)|sprites]], despite this being a specific name for one of its included members. All "sprites" were small, mostly humanoid fey, that typically displayed some insect-like attributes (such as wings). Besides the classical [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] for which the group was named, there were the [[sea sprite]]s, [[shrub sprite]]s, the [[light maker]]s of [[Chult]], [[grig]]s, [[nixie]]s, [[pixie]]s, The [[winterling]], despite also being small and winged, was not included.{{Cite dragon/324/Chilled to the Bone}} Conversely, the [[sakina]] of [[Zakhara]] were considered "sprites", despite not exhibiting any of the typical features of one.

Yet another diverse group of minuscule fey were the [[gremlin]]s, who descended from [[goblin]]s transformed by fomorian rituals. They included the [[fremlin]], [[galltrit]], [[jermlaine]], [[snyad]], and the [[plainsjan]] that inhabited the planet [[Anadia]] in [[Realmspace]]. Mites were also considered by some to be members of this group.

Of course, many fey could not be classified into any larger group beyond being related to either nature or emotion.{{speculation}} These included:
