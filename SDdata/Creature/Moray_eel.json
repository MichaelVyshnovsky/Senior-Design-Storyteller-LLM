        "mainbody": "A '''moray eel''' was a large type of [[eel]] with a deadly bite.<ref group=\"note\">The [[cave moray]] from ''[[Monster Manual II 1st edition]]'' is unlikely to be the same creature as the moray eel, due to its description and no mention of it being an eel. Other creatures of the Realms also have the term moray in their name, such as [[moray rat]]s in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)]]''.",
        "Description": "These eels were larger and more dangerous than typical eels. Moray eels could weigh up to {{SI|100|lb|k|long=yes}} and grow to be around {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} long.",
        "Combat": "Although not the most fearsome opponents an adventurer could face, one still had to be wary of these eels, as they had a deadly bite.",
        "Ecology": "Moray eels were often found in [[locathah]] lairs, where they acted as keepers and sentries.\n\nIn [[Ser√¥s]], the great undersea realm, moray eels, [[lobster]]s, and [[octopus]]es were considered natural enemies of one another.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[shalarin]] [[priestess]], [[Tu'ala'keth]], conjured a menacing underwater world with [[coral]] formations, where moray eels lurked amidst other threats in a limitless ocean.",
        "Types of Moray Eels": "* [[Giant moray eels]], also known as giant morays, were the giant variety of moray eels"
