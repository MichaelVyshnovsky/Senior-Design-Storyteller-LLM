Digesters were a ravenous, predatory species of magical beasts.
These creatures stood on average  in height upon two powerful hind legs and weighed around . Their bodies sported a long tail, had a grey pebbly hide with dagger-like markings that helped them to camouflaged, and overall measured  in length. Their heads were narrow with sucking mouths and sported a tube-like orifice on their forehead.
Digesters had a ravenous appetite, rarely feeling full, but when they were the beasts laid low and tried to avoid other creatures.
Digesters were capable of seeing in both areas of low-light and total darkness. They were also impervious to harm from acid.
These creatures were capable of shooting acid from the tube-like they sported on their foreheads, either spraying it out in a cone of roughly  or as a concentrated stream out to . Once a digester used this function they had to wait some time before they could spray again. 
When a digester spotted a likely target they would charge at them and spray their acid. If they found that was not sufficient to kill their prey, a digester would then attack with their hind legs until they were able to use their acid spray once more.
Around 1372 DR, a digester roamed the valley of High Thorog after having been freed from Telkouns Tower.
A year later, it was found that Quons shop in Zhentil Keep held a digester in its kennels.
