Dusk elves were a subset of elves that took no side in the War of the Seldarine. Gaining the enmity of Corellon, these elves were accepted and sheltered from the Protectors vengeance by Sehanine Moonbow.
The Velikovnas were a family of dusk elves that inhabited Barovia. Among their number were Patrina Velikovna, one of Strahd von Zarovichs former brides who haunted the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft as a banshee, and her brother, Kasimir Velikov.
