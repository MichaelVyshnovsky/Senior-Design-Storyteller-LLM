'''Kapenta''' was a species of edible [[sprat]] [[fish]] that inhabited most of the inland waterways of [[Chult]] in [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
These fishes had a light body decorated with dark vertical stripes.

==Ecology==
Kapenta were found in abundance in the waters of the [[Tiryki River|Tiryki]] and [[River Soshenstar|Soshenstar]] rivers and as such, they were one of the most common freshwater fish consumed by the inhabitants of [[Port Nyanzaru]].

They were a favorite prey of the [[giant tigerfish]], and anyone fishing for karpenta had to be wary of tigershark attacks.

==Uses==
A traditional [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] way of eating kapenta was shallow-frying them whole with [[onion]]s and [[groundnut]] powder.
