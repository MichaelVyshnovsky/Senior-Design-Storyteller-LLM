Kapenta was a species of edible sprat fish that inhabited most of the inland waterways of Chult in southwest Faer√ªn.
These fishes had a light body decorated with dark vertical stripes.
Kapenta were found in abundance in the waters of the Tiryki and Soshenstar rivers and as such, they were one of the most common freshwater fish consumed by the inhabitants of Port Nyanzaru.
They were a favorite prey of the giant tigerfish, and anyone fishing for karpenta had to be wary of tigershark attacks.
A traditional Chultan way of eating kapenta was shallow-frying them whole with onions and groundnut powder.
