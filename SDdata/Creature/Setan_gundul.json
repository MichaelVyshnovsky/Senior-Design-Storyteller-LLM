        "Description": "A setan gundul resembled a small [[human]] child. It was bald except for hair gathered in a topknot. It was the only memedi incapable of verbal communication.",
        "Combat": "Like all common memedi, setan gundul were harmless and avoided all combat.",
        "Abilities": "If a human saw a setan gundul, they were struck with effects similar to that of a ''[[fear]]'' spell.",
        "Society": "Setan gundul were solitary creatures.",
        "Habitat": "Setan gundul were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of [[Bawa]] and other islands within the [[Island Kingdoms]].",
        "Ecology": "Setan gundul were summoned only by elderly widows. The summoning process involved the widow entering into a two-day long trance. If successful, the setan gundul appeared, holding a mirror made from [[brass]]. If an individual was able to overcome the effects of ''fear'' and gazed into the mirror, they were given an omen of their future. Setan gundul only appeared at night and vanished with the dawn. It would remain longer if offered sufficient tributes and treated with kindness and respect."
