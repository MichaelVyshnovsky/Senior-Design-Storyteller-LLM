It was the only memedi incapable of verbal communication.\nLike all common memedi, setan gundul were harmless and avoided all combat.\nIf a human saw a setan gundul, they were struck with effects similar to that of a fear spell.\nSetan gundul were solitary creatures.\nSetan gundul were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of Bawa and other islands within the Island Kingdoms.\nSetan gundul were summoned only by elderly widows. The summoning process involved the widow entering into a two-day long trance. If successful, the setan gundul appeared, holding a mirror made from brass. If an individual was able to overcome the effects of fear and gazed into the mirror, they were given an omen of their future. Setan gundul only appeared at night and vanished with the dawn. It would remain longer if offered sufficient tributes and treated with kindness and respect."
