        "mainbody": "'''Cuprilachs''' were among some of the most dangerous of the [[rilmani]] subspecies.\n\n{{Quote|Sometimes [[the Balance]]’s best served by removing the most significant weights from the scales. That’s my job, berk. I find the cutter who's causing the biggest tilt in the Balance, and I put 'im on the dead-book. Remember me the next time you start offing those [[tanar'ri]] or [[baatezu]] high-ups - keep upsetting things, and all you'll be doing is climbing higher on my list. You'll never even know when I take you off the Balance.|Raidamos, a cuprilach agent}}",
        "Description": "Cuprilachs bore a resemblance to [[human]]s, but had the slight and wiry graceful frames typical of [[elves]] and [[half-elves]]. Their skin was of a [[copper]]y metallic color and they had featureless, [[ruby]]-red eyes, which emitted a pearly light.",
        "Personality": "These rilmani had a very hot-tempered, arrogant air. They were also quite rebellious and violent. Despite this nature, they never refused a target and served [[aurumach]]s to the best of their ability.\n\nCuprilachs believed that the only way maintaining the Balance that the rilmani held so dear was to eliminate powerful creatures with extreme [[alignment]]s. They felt that there were no tricks or ruses too underhanded for them to pull off in the name of their mission.",
        "Abilities": "They possessed an innate [[spell]]casting ability, allowing them to cast at will ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[delude]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[forget]]'', ''[[improved invisibility]]'',  ''[[wraithform]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[locate creature]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', and ''[[see invisibility]]''. Three time per days they could cast the spells ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[mislead]]'', and ''[[poison (spell)|poison]]''.\n\nIn addition, cuprilachs could cast the standard rilmani arsenal of spells: ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[dismissal]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''. They always had the spell ''[[know alignment]]'' active.\n\nBeyond spells, cuprilachs could conjure a fan-shaped spray of [[acid]], {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} wide, once per day. And they could summon one to three [[ferrumach]]s to their aid.  They could only be harmed by weapons with a [[item enchantment|''+2 or greater enchantment'']].\n\nLike all rilmani, cuprilachs could freely travel to the [[Astral plane]] or any of the [[Outer Planes]], but their access to the [[Prime Material plane]] was restricted. They were only capable of traveling there if a creature of law or chaos of equal power was already present.",
        "Combat": "Cuprilachs preferred to face their opponents with a stealthy approach, \n\nThey were often known to fight with [[short sword]]s and [[shuriken|throwing stars]], ''[[longbow]]s of [[speed]]'', and [[rapier]]s. Even when unarmed a cuprilach was a dangerous combatant, as they were generally skilled martial artists.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Cuprilachs were primarily found in the [[Outlands]], in the regions that were closest to the Spire. They could be encountered anywhere within the Astral and Outer Planes, but were rarely seen on the Prime Material plane.\n\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]], they could be found in the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]].",
            "Languages": "Like all rilmani the cuprilachs were capable of speaking their own species language, [[Common]], and [[Undercommon]]. In addition, they were known to speak the languages [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]], [[Celestial language|Celestial]], and [[Infernal language|Infernal]]."
