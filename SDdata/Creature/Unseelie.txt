'''Unseelie''' were a kind of malevolent [[sprite]] who enjoyed harming others.

==Description==
Though roughly [[humanoid]] in appearance, unseelie features were usually exaggerated and grotesque. Examples included elongated arms, large noses, and other twisted features. Most had tattered insect wings. Unseelie could alter their size between {{SI|1|inch|c|long=yes}} and {{SI|1|foot|c|long=yes}}.

==Combat==
All unseelie could become [[Invisibility|invisible]] whenever they wished. They enjoyed ambushing and terrorizing their victims. They used small weapons in combat coated with a [[poison]] capable of inducing sleep in their targets. Those unlucky enough to fall victim to this poison found themselves bound and tortured upon waking.

Unseelie could cast a single [[spell]] once per day. They usually preferred casting spells that caused harm to others.

==Society==
[[File:Unseelie Sprite (Colored).png|thumb|273px]]
Sadistic by nature, unseelie took great pleasure from harming or even killing any who wandered into their territory. Even victims able to escape often did so with ''[[polymorph]]ed'' appendages. Unseelie preferred to dwell in dark places like swamps, bogs, and twisted forests.

These creatures did not have a structured society. Anarchy reigned supreme among the unseelie with each individual behaving as they wished. The unseelie palaces were located on an invisible [[demiplane]].

==History==
The unseelie were locked in a seemingly endless war with their cousins, the [[seelie]]. Conflicts between the two occurred in the [[Yuirwood]] of [[Aglarond]]. 

==Ecology==
Though unseelie acquired their sustenance from their home demiplane, they tormented local animal populations purely for the joy of it. Likewise, they enjoyed felling trees, damaging vegetation, and poisoning fresh water for sport.

Unseelie inhabited mountain passes around the land of [[Halruaa]] where they lured travelers off paths into perilous wilderness. Stories of the dark fey folk were common among the inhabitants of the region.
