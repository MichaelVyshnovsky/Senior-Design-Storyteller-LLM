Sadistic by nature, unseelie took great pleasure from harming or even killing any who wandered into their territory. Even victims able to escape often did so with polymorphed appendages. Unseelie preferred to dwell in dark places like swamps, bogs, and twisted forests.
These creatures did not have a structured society. Anarchy reigned supreme among the unseelie with each individual behaving as they wished. The unseelie palaces were located on an invisible demiplane.
The unseelie were locked in a seemingly endless war with their cousins, the seelie. Conflicts between the two occurred in the Yuirwood of Aglarond. 
Though unseelie acquired their sustenance from their home demiplane, they tormented local animal populations purely for the joy of it. Likewise, they enjoyed felling trees, damaging vegetation, and poisoning fresh water for sport.
Unseelie inhabited mountain passes around the land of Halruaa where they lured travelers off paths into perilous wilderness. Stories of the dark fey folk were common among the inhabitants of the region.
