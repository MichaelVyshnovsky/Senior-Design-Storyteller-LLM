'''Earth elementals''' were extremely strong [[elemental]]s who rarely left their [[Elemental Plane of Earth|home plane]].

==Description==
These elementals had a vaguely humanoid shape, with club-like arms made of jagged stone and a head made of both dirt and stone. Occasionally chunks of minerals, [[gem]]s, or metals were set within their stony bodies.

<nowiki> </nowiki>Their bodies typically moved at a slow, trodding pace.

==Personality==
Earth elementals were not especially intelligent. However, like all elementals, they instinctively resented any creature that conjured them from their home plane and bound them into its service.

==Biology==
Being elementals, these creatures did not require any air, food, drink, or sleep to survive.

==Abilities==
Earth elementals were capable of gliding through stone and dirt as though it were liquid, but only if they were unworked and non-magical. They were also capable of precisely pinpointing the location of nearby opponents, but only if they were standing on solid ground, a type of vision that was known as [[tremorsense]].

Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], these elementals could not cross bodies of water. Thus they had to use their ability of burrowing through unworked earth to pass underneath the ground on which bodies of water stood.

Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing weaponry were all ineffective against earth elementals unless they were [[item enchantment|enchanted]]. Prior to the Time of Troubles, they could only be damaged by weapons with a ''+2 enchantment'' or greater.

==Combat==
Earth elementals would use their brute strength when fighting an opponent, slamming against them. They were also considered to be living siege weapons, doing severe damage to objects and structures, but especially those made of stone or earth.

==Society==
===Summoning===
These elementals could be summoned to the [[Prime Material plane]] through use of the spells ''[[conjure elemental]]'', ''[[conjure earth elemental]]'', ''[[conjure lesser earth elemental]]'',{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn Game Manual|143}} ''[[elemental servant]]'', ''[[elemental summoning]]'',{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal Game Manual|21}} ''[[summon monster III]]'', and ''[[summon monster VI]]''.

There were also [[magical item]]s that could achieve this, such as a ''[[stone of controlling earth elementals]]'', ''[[elemental gem]]s''.  the ''[[Elemental Scourge]]'' in [[Kossuth's House]], the ''[[laughing hare]]'', the [[Zakharan]] instrument ''[[rababah of the dao]]'' (but only if played by a [[bard]] or ''[[rawunin]]''),{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}} and the ''[[Tome of Twelve Seals]]''.

In terms of [[divine magic]], [[specialty priest]]s known as [[earthwalker]]s were granted the power to summon an earth elemental once per day or incredibly powerful ones once per [[tenday]] by their deity [[Grumbar]]. Upon reaching a certain level of skill, earthwalkers summoned their first earth elemental in a religious ceremony called [[Brotherhood of Earth]].

It was impossible to summon an earth elemental while in the [[phlogiston]].

===Languages===
Earth elementals rarely spoke, though when they did speak they used the [[Terran]] language.
===Relationships===
Earth elementals were [[favored monster]]s of many [[deities]] within the [[Morndinsamman]], acting as their divine servants. These deities included [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], [[Dumathoin]]. They were also servants of the exiled members of this pantheon, the [[duergar]] gods [[Deep Duerra]] and [[Laduguer]].

In the [[gnome pantheon]], these elementals were favored monsters of the deities [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], [[Flandal Steelskin]], and [[Segojan Earthcaller]]. Outside of pantheons, individual deities that favored earth elementals as divine servants included [[Geb]], [[Grumbar]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], and [[Sheela Peryroyl]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==History==
A [[svirfneblin]] [[cleric]], [[Belwar Dissengulp]], once summoned an earth elemental to protect his mining party from a [[drow]] ambush.<ref>
