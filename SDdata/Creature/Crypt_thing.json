        "mainbody": "'''Crypt things''' were a rare kind of intelligent [[undead]]<ref group=\"note\">In 1st edition, the crypt thing, though skeletal in appearance, is not undead, while in 2nd edition it is.<ref>{{Cite dragon/55/Fiend Folio Findings}} bound to protect a specific burial site.",
        "Description": "A crypt thing resembled a [[human]]-sized [[skeleton]] wearing dark robes. Their empty eye sockets contained eerie points of red light.",
        "Combat": "What made crypt things most dangerous was their ability to ''[[teleport]]'' adversaries away. Otherwise they attacked with their bare, skeletal hands. Aside from the common immunities of the undead, only weapons imbued with magic were able to hurt a crypt thing. Due to their strong attachment to the place they guarded, [[priest]]s were unable to [[Turn undead|drive them away with their holy power]].",
        "History": "Following the actions of the [[Shoon Imperium]]'s [[Necromancers' Corp]] in the {{YearlinkName|1235}}, crypt things were among the many undead that roamed the ruins of [[Mamlukkar]] in [[Tethyr]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some rumors claimed that there existed a type of crypt thing would paralyzed its opponents and make them ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'' at the same time, rather than teleporting them.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "According to the sage [[Elminster]], crypt things existed in the ruins in the [[Undermoor]], the area of the [[Underdark]] below the [[High Moor]] and [[Serpent Hills]].<ref><ref> They could also be encountered in the dreaded ruins of [[Shoonach]].<ref>\n\nCrypt things also dwelt in the [[Abyss]], both in the endless black sand of the Layer of Desert,<ref> as well as in the [[Thanatos (Abyss)|realm of Orcus]], where there existed a whole Valley of Crypt Things. As an exception to the rule, 24 of them sat together, each on a throne, at the sides of this vale.<ref> They could also be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]."

        "Notable Crypt Things": "*[[Damien Morienus]], a former master of the North Tower of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]]. He was turned undead by the demons he himself summoned. He was discovered haunting his [[Accursed Tower]] in [[Icewind Dale]] circa [[1369 DR]].\n* A pair of crypt things safeguarded the Toryvhallen crypt within the catacombs of [[Ascalhorn]]. One of them possessed a ''[[belt of giant strength|girdle of stone giant strength]]'', while the other held a ''[[ring of shocking grasp]]''. Both were capable of ''[[teleport]]ing'' intruders to either outside the main gates of the fortress-town or to the pillories in its central square. The latter action was only ever taken when an intruder displayed intent to vandalize or rob the crypt."
