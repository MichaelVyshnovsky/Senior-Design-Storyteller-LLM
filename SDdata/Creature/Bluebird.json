        "mainbody": "luebird was a species of small blue-feathered bird found in the Northwest Faer√ªn, the forest of Cormanthor, and in Kara-Tur.\nTrees in the Midwood of Cormanthor were homes to many species of forest wildlife, including chirping bluebirds.\nIn the 14 century DR, popularity of keeping bluebirds as pets in Cormyr increased and local breeders in the city of Wheloon started training these little blue animals.\nWater nagas inhabiting Cormanthor preyed on bluebirds, slithering up the tree trunks in search of their nests. Shikki-gaki, a type of undead spirit found in the land of Kara-Tur, were known to devour bluebirds after turning to evil.\nGoddess Lliira, the Mistress of Revels, counted bluebirds among her beloved animals and was known to manifest herself as a bluebird. The deity Tyche favored bluebirds as well."
