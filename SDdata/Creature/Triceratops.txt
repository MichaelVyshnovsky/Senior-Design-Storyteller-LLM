A '''triceratops''' ('''''ytepka''''' in the [[Chultan language]]) was a gargantuan, herbivorous, herd [[dinosaur]], also known as '''three horn''' by the inhabitants of the [[Malatran Plateau]].

==Description==
These massive dinosaurs had a bony plate on their six-foot-long skull for defense, with two long horns on the top and a shorter horn at the nose. Their bodies extended for about 25 feet (7.6 meters), and they weighed around ten tons (nine metric tons).

==Behavior==
Triceratops had especially short tempers for herbivores, and would charge, trample, and skewer any creature invading their territory. When defending their young, they were intelligent enough to form a circle around them, horns facing outwards.

==Combat==
A triceratops could trample creatures smaller than it; it would gore anything else.

==Reputation==
In [[Chult]], where these dinosaurs were common, there was a secret society, the [[Triceratops Society]], named after them, known for leaving iron triceratops figurines as signs of warning.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], some could be found in the [[Forbidden Plateau (divine realm)|Forbidden Plateau]].

==Notable triceratops==
* [[Ubtao's Favorite]], a racing triceratops from [[Port Nyanzaru]].
