        "mainbody": "'''Aquatic remnants''' were a type of [[undead#aquatic undead|aquatic undead]] related to [[ghost]]s that were found in the [[Domains of Dread]] and the [[Border Ethereal]]. These sorrowful spirits arose from the bodies of [[demihuman]]s and [[human]]s whose corpses were callously tossed aside into unconsecrated waters after they had died of exhaustion and acute stress. They sometimes appeared on the world of [[Toril]], acting as servants of the goddess [[Umberlee]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|11}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"servant\">While the Umberlant preist receiving aquatic remnants from Umberlee could be construed as a unique circumstance, brought about by the Grand Conjunction's weakening of dimensional barriers, there are plenty of examples of [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian gods]] calling upon creatures from the Domains of Dread as [[favored monster]]s, such as [[will o'deep]]s acting in service to [[Ibrandul]] (''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', p. 72).",
        "Description": "These undead appeared as no more than melancholic faces with empty eye sockets and pale floating hands, elusively flickering within the water. The rest of their body, through present to some degree, always seemed to fade away into the depths of water, leaving no sight of their legs.",
        "Behavior": "Aquatic remnants were not always hostile to the living, not sharing the hatred that many other ghostly undead did. Though they would not hesitate to attack any member of the race that had caused their condition and could even be found aiding those who fought against people who had mistreated the aquatic remnant in life.",
        "Abilities": "Much like a ghost, these creatures were ethereal beings that could materialize themselves. When semi-materialized the cold, wet touch of their hands chilled to the bone any corporeal creature they touched, putting them at risk of hypothermia. However, if an aquatic remnant so chose their touch could inflict no harm, allowing them to grasp a corporeal creature's hands and pull them into the water to perform a brief \"mouth-to-mouth resuscitation\". This eerie ritual partly drew the corporeal creature into the Border Ethereal, essentially conveying upon them the ability to [[water breathing|breath water]] so long as they continued to hold one of the aquatic remnant's semi-materialized hand.\n\nWhen in this semi-materialized state they could be harmed by [[silver]] or [[magic item|magical]] weaponry, as well as ''[[holy water]]'', and could be ''[[turn undead|turned]]'' in a manner equivalent to a normal ghost. When not in this state they could only be harmed by creatures that were likewise ethereal.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Languages": "These spirits could only be communicated with through magical means."

        "History": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, an [[Umberlant]] [[unnamed Umberlant preacher|priest]] was erratically preaching around the docks of [[Ravens Bluff]] that a cataclysm was on the horizon, becoming more fanatical and less friendly with those around him.{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|8}} The priest had sensed the approach of an event in the Domains of Dread known as the [[Grand Conjunction]], which would weaken the boundary between the two planes of existence and allow for [[portal]]s to open sporadically between the two. One portal in particular remained open for over a [[tenday]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|2}} allowing a [[sea spawn master]] named [[Otis Fashion]] to come through.{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|9-12}}\n\nHaving been informed about the priest at [[Tym's Supple Leather Shoppe]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|11-12}}"
