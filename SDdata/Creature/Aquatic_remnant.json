        "mainbody": "quatic remnants were a type of aquatic undead related to ghosts that were found in the Domains of Dread and the Border Ethereal. These sorrowful spirits arose from the bodies of demihumans and humans whose corpses were callously tossed aside into unconsecrated waters after they had died of exhaustion and acute stress. They sometimes appeared on the world of Toril, acting as servants of the goddess Umberlee.While the Umberlant preist receiving aquatic remnants from Umberlee could be construed as a unique circumstance, brought about by the Grand Conjunctions weakening of dimensional barriers, there are plenty of examples of Faer√ªnian gods calling upon creatures from the Domains of Dread as favored monsters, such as will odeeps acting in service to Ibrandul (Faiths & Avatars, p. 72).\nThese undead appeared as no more than melancholic faces with empty eye sockets and pale floating hands, elusively flickering within the water. The rest of their body, through present to some degree, always seemed to fade away into the depths of water, leaving no sight of their legs.\nAquatic remnants were not always hostile to the living, not sharing the hatred that many other ghostly undead did. Though they would not hesitate to attack any member of the race that had caused their condition and could even be found aiding those who fought against people who had mistreated the aquatic remnant in life.\nMuch like a ghost, these creatures were ethereal beings that could materialize themselves. When semi-materialized the cold, wet touch of their hands chilled to the bone any corporeal creature they touched, putting them at risk of hypothermia. However, if an aquatic remnant so chose their touch could inflict no harm, allowing them to grasp a corporeal creatures hands and pull them into the water to perform a brief \"mouth-to-mouth resuscitation\". This eerie ritual partly drew the corporeal creature into the Border Ethereal, essentially conveying upon them the ability to breath water so long as they continued to hold one of the aquatic remnants semi-materialized hand.\nWhen in this semi-materialized state they could be harmed by silver or magical weaponry, as well as holy water, and could be turned in a manner equivalent to a normal ghost. When not in this state they could only be harmed by creatures that were likewise ethereal.\nMaterially these spirits were typically confined to the bodies of water wherein their corpse had been abandoned, such as pools or rivers, but beyond they were trapped within the Border Ethereal until someone could perform a ritual burial surface over their remains.\nThese spirits could only be communicated with through magical means.\nAround the , an Umberlant priest was erratically preaching around the docks of Ravens Bluff that a cataclysm was on the horizon, becoming more fanatical and less friendly with those around him. The priest had sensed the approach of an event in the Domains of Dread known as the Grand Conjunction, which would weaken the boundary between the two planes of existence and allow for portals to open sporadically between the two. One portal in particular remained open for over a tenday, allowing a sea spawn master named Otis Fashion to come through.\nHaving been informed about the priest at Tyms Supple Leather Shoppe,"
