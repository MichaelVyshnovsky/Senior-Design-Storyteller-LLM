'''Giant gars''' were a rare, larger-than-normal variety of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar gar].

==Description==
These creatures had long, sleek, and aerodynamic bodies that measured {{SIrange|21|30|ft|long=yes}} in length. They had small fins but were covered in large, hard, overlapping scales. Their mouths were similar to those of an [[alligator]] or [[crocodile]] and contained needle-sharp teeth.

==Behavior==
Giant gars were comparatively far more aggressive than their smaller cousins. They were largely fearless and considered anything small enough to swallow to be prey.

==Combat==
These creatures were capable of swallowing whole their victims, as well as objects up to {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length. Even giant gars that were considered to be small in size were capable of swallowing whole [[elves]] and [[dwarves]].

==History==
A giant gar was one of many creatures installed as guardians in the [[Temple of Gulkulath]] within [[Undermountain]].

==Sub-Species==
;Blackfins: A species of giant gar that inhabited areas with cold water. They were known to be found around some areas of the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Ecology==
Giant gars lived in groups known as schools, typically comprising up to six members.

===Habitats===
These creatures were known to inhabit deep freshwater lakes and rivers in temperate regions.

In the land of [[Faerûn]] they could be found in the waters around [[Cormanthor]], particularly in the [[River Ashaba]]. the shallows of the [[Rat Hills]], freshwater bodies in the Moonshae Isles, the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], that sea's northern fjord [[Dragon Reach]], and [[Thay]]'s [[River Lapendrar]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-04 - River Lapendrar Fauna}}

Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in the tropical and subtropical fresh waters of [[Kara-Tur]]. Within the [[Underdark]], giant gars could be found in the upper lake of [[Deepearth]].

Besides [[Toril]], giant gars were known to be found on the planet of [[Oerth]].
