They were capable of language, culture, and in many cases of learning magic.\nHumanoids were typically bipedal, having two arms, two legs, and walking upright. But they varied widely in terms of size and features. and they were generally capable of using tools and weapons.\nDemihumans This was the term used to collectively refer to dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings. What some humans viewed as being the \"civilized\", generally benevolent, non-humans. The term \"demihuman\" was rooted in a human-centric perspective, as some humans considered themselves to be wholly distinct from other humanoids, some even going so far as to claim that humans predated most humanoid races. A few of the Nubari tribes of the Malatran Plateau considered anything not human to be an animal and thus allowable to be hunted down and eaten.\nGoblinoids Otherwise known as \"goblinkin,\" \"goblinoid\" was a term used to collectively refer to goblins and the humanoid races believed to be related to them, such as hobgoblins and orcs.\nHumanoids The term humanoids was also frequently used in a narrower sense, which excluded humans as well as demihumans and giants.\nThe most numerous humanoid societies were those of the dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. \nA few other humanoid races were far more primitive and generally evil\nSometimes these humanoids would go against the norms of their societies and take up the life of an adventurer. They often faced prejudice along the way, with inns having rules against serving them, shops refusing to do business with them, authorities watching them closely for signs of trouble, They could also require weapons specially designed for someone of their size."
