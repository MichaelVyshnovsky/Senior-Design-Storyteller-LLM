        "mainbody": "'''Kalins''' were a monstrous insect species that resembled a cross between an [[ant]] and a [[spider]].There were no known instances of a kalin in a Realms sourcebook. However, they are listed in ''[[Demihuman Deities]]'' as one of many creatures that could appear in the Realms to act on behalf of [[Loth]]. For this reason, kalins are documented in this article.",
        "Description": "On average these creatures were {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length and covered in chitinous plates that were mottled brown and yellow. They had oversized, glowing yellow eyes. Their mandibles were tremendous and their forward limbs had many sharp edges.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were rather aggressive, slightly less so than [[wall-walker]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Much like a spider, kalins could exude a sticky strand from their abdomens to descend from heights.",
        "Combat": "Kalin would grapple prey with their crushing mandibles and slash them with their limbs. They would ignore other creatures attacking them, focusing all attention on their grappled prey, unless severely injured.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Kalin were a carnivorous species. They typically fed upon [[giant beetle]]s, [[giant spider]]s, and [[tunnel worm]]s, though on occasion they ate [[humanoid]]s.",
            "Habitats": "Kalin typically lived in caves or underground, where they competed with wall walkers for both prey and space.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], these creatures could be found on the planet of [[Athas]].",
            "Relationships": "These creatures were known to act as [[favored animal|servants]] of the [[Faer√ªn]]ian [[deity]] [[Lolth]].\n\nSome cultures would attempt to domesticate kalin, though they were very unruly and difficult to handle as [[mount]]s, usually needing to be separated from other mounts. In addition, special tack and [[saddle]]s were needed if a rider wanted to have them go across walls and ceilings. Those skilled in riding them were capable of fighting cooperatively with their mount.",
            "Usages": "Some primitive, cave-dwelling cultures were known to scavenge plates from dead kalin and use them to fashion crude [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, and other tools."
