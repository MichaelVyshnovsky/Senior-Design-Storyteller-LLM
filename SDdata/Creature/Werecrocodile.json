        "Description": "In their [[humanoid]] forms, werecrocodiles were biologically indistinguishable from non-lycanthropes. A werecrocodile's humanoid face was thin, with sharp features, a long nose and chin, a noticeable overbite, and eyes that held a steady stare which could be somewhat unnerving.\n\nIn crocodilian form, they had red eyes<ref group=\"note\">In [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]] and in the [[3rd edition]] sourcebook ''[[Monsters of Faerun]]'', werecrocodiles only possessed human and crocodile forms; they did not gain a hybrid form until the [[3.5 edition]] sourcebook ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]''. In this form, they were hulking, {{SIAdj|7|foot|long=yes}} tall crocodiles that stood upright on short legs.",
        "Combat": "In [[human]] form, werecrocodiles were considerably strong and preferred to grab single opponents in their jaws and hold them underwater. In hybrid form, they relied much more on their tails, preferring to bite only when moving in to grapple with an enemy.\n\nWerecrocodiles liked to ambush their prey, either by getting close in their humanoid form or by lying in wait submerged under water. A favorite maneuver was to get close to a target while in humanoid form, use their great strength to grab them and drag them into the water, and then change form to hold and drown the victim. They could not breathe underwater, but could hold their breath for considerably longer than most normal humanoids.\n\nSome werecrocodiles were also able to recruit or summon a small number of mundane crocodiles which would obediently aid them in battle.\n\nWerecrocodiles could regenerate and heal from injuries, although this process was disrupted if they were hit by a weapon made of [[silver]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Reproduction": "As a rule, werecrocodiles only mated amongst each other, and birthed live young lycanthropes. Alternatively, anyone bitten by a werecrocodile ran the risk of contracting their form of [[lycanthropy]] and transforming into a werecrocodile at the next full [[Selûne (moon)|moon]]. The more grievous the bite, the more likely the victim was to contract the condition."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Language": "They could be very direct and concise when they spoke, occasionally snapping their jaws and speaking with hisses or bestial tones when emotional. They generally knew [[Common]] and traditionally also spoke the [[Mulhorandi language]]. Out in the swamplands, they sometimes relied on short, shrill vocalizations to call out to one another. Werecrocodiles could also communicate with mundane crocodiles and [[giant crocodile]]s.",
            "Religion": "Their patron [[god]] was [[Sebek]], the crocodile-headed minor [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi deity]], Their religion demanded that they ruthlessly protect their territory and impose themselves on those weaker than them, all the while devoting their glories to Sebek.\n\nSome werecrocodiles served Sebek as [[cleric]]s,{{Cite polyhedron/108/Forgotten Deities: Sebek|4}} Werecrocodile priests were known to bully other werecrocodiles, and were at the forefront of most schemes against humans."
