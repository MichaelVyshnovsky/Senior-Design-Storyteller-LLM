        "mainbody": "'''Gargoyles''' were vicious predators imbued with [[magic]].",
        "Description": "Gargoyles appeared to be winged statues of [[demon]]-like humanoids. These creatures could stand motionless for long periods of time, which added to the fa√ßade of their statue-like appearance.",
        "Personality": "Their original nature as statues aided them in that they are adept at appearing perfectly still, as if they are still made of stone, and their hides were rough and thick, similar to stone as well. They favored surprising their opponents, either by moving suddenly from their motionless state or by suddenly swooping down on their prey from a height.\n\nGargoyles were ferocious creatures, often attacking any creature they detected, and loved to inflict pain. They would torture any victims they could hold helpless, going so far as eating them just to hear their screams even though they required no food to survive, and so they much preferred intelligent races over anything else.",
        "History": "Originally, gargoyles were simply decorative stone statues and water spouts placed on buildings to help prevent the erosion and staining of the walls by deflecting rainwater. At some point, however, an unknown [[mage]] gave life to these statues, creating the monsters that went on to stalk the worlds.\n\nFour gargoyles served [[Imgig Zu]], defending his tower north of [[Waterdeep]] in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]]. They attacked a [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] patrol that investigated the tower.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|15-16}} Later, they snatched up [[Cybriana]], [[Priam Agrivar]], [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], and [[Onyx the Invincible]], carrying them into the tower, but were slain.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|18-22}}\n\nA number of gargoyles, alongside flying [[kenku (winged)|kenku]]s, were attendants to the [[one who waits]] in the [[Nine Hells]]. Later in 1357 DR, when the [[Great Door]] appeared in the Hells, the gargoyles and kenkus flew through and emerged first in the skies over [[Waterdeep]]. They were met in battle by [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] and [[Timoth Eyesbright]], before the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] arrived to defend the city. Later, when the exit of the ''[[gate]]'' was restored to its location in a pit outside the city, the same flying creatures assaulted [[Parwyyd Hanifar]], [[Dunstanny]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Cybriana]], before they ended the threat of the Great Door and the one who waits.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening}}",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Gargoyles could often be found lairing underground or in ruins with small groups of their kind.\n\nIn the [[Abyss]], gargoyles guarded the gates of Ungorth Reddik, [[Demogorgon]]'s fortress that rose from the fetid bogs of the [[Gaping Maw]].",
            "Languages": "In addition to having their own racial language, that was shared with kapoacinths and margoyles, gargoyles commonly spoke the [[Common]] tongue and [[Terran]].",
            "Relationships": "Sometimes gargoyles worked for evil masters in exchange for some small amount of treasure, though their primary payment was the opportunity to attack intruders.",
            "Usage": "Gargoyle horns were often used as an ingredient in the brewing of ''[[potion of invulnerability|potions of invulnerability]]'' and ''[[potion of flying|potions of flying]]''."
