A '''Velsharess Orbb''' was a species of venomous spider from the [[Underdark]]. The poison it secreted was among the most dangerous [[poison]] in all of [[Toril]].

==Description==
Generally speaking, this spider resembled the [[black widow]] of the surface world.

==History==
These spiders were small enough that they could be concealed within a ring. [[Matron mother|Matron Mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]] was known to wear a ring containing a Velsharess Orbb within.
