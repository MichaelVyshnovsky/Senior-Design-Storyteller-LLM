A Velsharess Orbb was a species of venomous spider from the Underdark. The poison it secreted was among the most dangerous poison in all of Toril.
Generally speaking, this spider resembled the black widow of the surface world.
These spiders were small enough that they could be concealed within a ring. Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre was known to wear a ring containing a Velsharess Orbb within.
