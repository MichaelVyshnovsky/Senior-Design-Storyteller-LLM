        "mainbody": "Bone golems, sometimes referred to as skeletal golems, were terrifying grizzly constructs assembled from bones of various creatures and, despite their appearance, were not undead creatures.\nBone golems usually  tall creatures, or even bone scythes. Oftentimes, bone golems were put together using bones from various creators, from beasts to humanoids. This gave them a terrifying appearance of something spawned by nightmares.\nthumb|A bone golem from the Domains of Dread.\nThese fearsome constructs could unleash a blood-curdling laugh that filled the hearts of their opponents with terror. This ability could cause the victims to become paralyzed with fear or even die of extreme fright.\nThese constructs were invulnerable to non-magical weapons and were unaffected by sleep, charm, hold, and similar spells. Like other constructs, they were safe from gases, as well as immune to fire, cold, and electricity. Bone golems were not undead and could not be turned. However, bone golems were susceptible to the shatter spell as it caused them to become vulnerable to any physical damage. Despite their appearance, bone golems were not undead and shared no vulnerabilities of such creatures imbued with the magic of the Negative Energy plane.\nLike many other constructs, bone golems were not intelligent creatures and could only follow the most basic commands. They could not devise plans of attack nor use clever strategies. They took on a direct approach in battle.\nBone golem creation required the casting of various spells onto the bones used in the process. These spells included animate dead, symbol of fear, binding, and wish."
