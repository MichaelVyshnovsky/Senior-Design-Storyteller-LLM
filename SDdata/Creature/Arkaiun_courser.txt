The '''Arkaiun courser''' was a breed of heavy [[warhorse]] from the lands of [[Dambrath]] and the [[Shining South]].

==Description==
These hardy and stout equines had brown hide and a white muzzle. They were bred to endure long rides and nomadic lifestyles of the [[Arkaiun]] [[human]]s that inhabited Dambrath, [[Halruaa]], and [[the Shaar]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Arkaiun coursers were a valuable commodity and exported from the Shining South as far as the northern city of [[Neverwinter]].
