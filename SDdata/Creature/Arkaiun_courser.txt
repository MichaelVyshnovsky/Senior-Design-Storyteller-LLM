The Arkaiun courser was a breed of heavy warhorse from the lands of Dambrath and the Shining South.
These hardy and stout equines had brown hide and a white muzzle. They were bred to endure long rides and nomadic lifestyles of the Arkaiun humans that inhabited Dambrath, Halruaa, and the Shaar.
By the late 15 century DR, Arkaiun coursers were a valuable commodity and exported from the Shining South as far as the northern city of Neverwinter.
