Chardalyn mephits were mephits composed of chardalyn.
Chardalyn mephits were particularly cruel. They even timed their deaths to inflict the most damage possible.
Chardalyn mephits had the ability to appear as a shard of chardalyn when not moving. They had the innate ability to replicate the effects of the fog cloud spell. Unlike other mephits, their attacks were empowered with necrotic energy.
In the late 15 century DR, chardalyn mephits could be found in the cave lair of Frostclaw, an awakened snowy owlbear who lived in Icewind Dale.
