        "mainbody": "'''Rugs of smothering''' were magically animated rugs that were commonly employed as [[trap]]s. They attacked by trapping and constraining their victims.",
        "Description": "There was a large variety of shapes and appearances that a rug of smothering could be made into. They sometimes were built to resemble ''[[carpet of flying|carpets of flying]]'', but were otherwise indistinguishable from ordinary, non-magical rugs, except if inspected through magical detection.",
        "Combat": "The typical tactic adopted by a rug of smothering in combat was to rise and constrict a target creature standing on it or next to it. The trapped creature could not breathe while imprisoned and was slowly crushed by the rug unless freed. While a rug of smothering had a creature in its grasp, it had the ability to deflect part of any damage it received to its victim.\n\nLike all [[construct]]s, rugs of smothering were susceptible to [[antimagic]] effects. They immediately fell unconscious while inside an ''[[antimagic field]]'' and could be knocked out for up to a minute if targeted by a ''[[dispel magic]]'' [[spell]]."
