        "mainbody": "'''Banderlogs''' were intelligent primates that resembled green-skinned [[baboon]]s with brown fur.",
        "Personality": "Banderlogs were less panicky than baboons.",
        "Combat": "Although they attacked with their sharp fangs at close distances, banderlogs' preferred offense was throwing [[retch plant]] fruits or [[coconut]]s, often while hanging off of a tree branch with one hand.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Banderlogs had their own rudimentary language, consisting of chatters and grunts.",
            "Relations": "Although looked down upon and often dominated by [[dakon]]s, banderlogs considered these fellow intelligent primates to be their kin and would often fight alongside them against foes such as [[yuan-ti]], [[qullan]], [[tasloi]], and [[gnoll]]s.{{Cite dragon/187/Ecology of the Dakon|26}}"

        "Notable Banderlogs": "[[Harrowdale|Harran]] [[goat]] herders were known to have experimented with letting their livestock be [[milk]]ed by trained banderlogs. These banderlogs were competitive with one another, seeing who could milk goats the fastest. The goats themselves appeared to prefer the touch of banderlogs' hands to those of humans, and would frequently fall asleep standing while being milked by one."
