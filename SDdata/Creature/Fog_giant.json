        "Description": {
            "Abilities": "Much like their cloud giant kin, fog giants had vision that extended into the infrared spectrum. However, they did not have true [[infravision]] and their vision was not hindered by bright light or strong heat. This allowed them to see through fogs and clouds with ease. They also possessed a good sense of smell, allowing them to track creatures by their scent.<ref>\n\nFog giants were known to be exceptionally good at hiding when in fog banks. Their keen senses made them difficult to surprise, while in contrast their ability to hide in the fog gave them a clear advantage when trying to surprise others. They were also known to typically be skilled in making [[trap]]s."
        },
        "Combat": "Fog giants were surprisingly stealthy. They preferred to start any battle from cover, surprising and scattering their enemies with thrown rocks before charging into melee range to attack. Generally they preferred to use clubs and their fists, but were known to wield swords as well.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Fog giants preferred to cook their meat, although cooking usually only entailed being roasted on a spit over a fire. Hooved animals were their preferred food, including sapient creatures like [[centaurs]]. They had a strong taste for sweets, and enjoyed confections and sweets immensely. They also enjoyed drinking large amounts of alcohol, although they did not brew or distill their own drinks. They would sometimes smoke fresh [[milkweed]] pods in pipes as well.",
            "Lycanthropy": "There were never any known cases of fog giants contracting any form of [[lycanthropy]]. This was speculated to be due to their relation to cloud giants, who possessed an immunity to all forms of the affliction, though whether or not they were truly immune was unknown.{{Cite dragon/266/Dragon's Bestiary: Giant Lycanthropes}}",
            "Lairs": "The area around their settlements were often trapped with deadfalls that they could easily trigger against intruders with a thrown rock. More traps were set on the regular pathways to their homes and hunting grounds, as these trails were difficult to simply hide.",
            "Homelands": "Fog giants were particularly common in the [[Evermoors]], and more rarely in the [[Frost Hills]] to the north or the [[Nether Mountains]] to the east. In [[northwest Faer√ªn]], they could be found in the [[Ice Mountains]] and [[Spine of the World]]. In the [[Shining South]] they were known to inhabit the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]]. And in the [[Unapproachable East]], fog giants were known to inhabit the [[Umber Marshes]].",
            "Relationships": "Fog giants generally did not mix well with other races, although they would trade with those of similar alignment and could be paid to provide services. Evil fog giants were known to raid the settlements of other races. The exception to animosity this was cloud giants, who they retained a cordial relationship with. One or two cloud giants could often be found with a fog giant hunting party.\n\nIn the Ordning, fog giants were ranked fourth, just below their kin cloud giants.<ref>",
            "Languages": "While they spoke both Jotun and Jotunskye, likely called Jotunskod. This dialect was unintelligible to all other giants except cloud giants."
        },
        "History": "Thousands of years ago, fog giants split from cloud giant society in the aftermath of a civil war."
