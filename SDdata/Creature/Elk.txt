Elk were the largest members of the deer family. They were favored by Uthgar and the sleeping god Ulutiu.
Elk had a good sense of smell and were adept at hiding.
Elk would flee from most predators or hunters, but on occasion they would turn and defend themselves against creatures smaller than themselves.
When forced to fight, they would use their hooves.
Elk could be found alone or with herds. in the Ama Basin where they were raised by the Issacortae, the dragonborn kingdom of Relmaur, and in the Howling Mountains.
