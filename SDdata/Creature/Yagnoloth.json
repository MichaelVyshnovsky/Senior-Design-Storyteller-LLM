        "mainbody": "gnoloths were horrifying humanoids that stood {{SIrange|10|15|ft}} and were covered in red scales. Their heads were small and seemingly skeletal, with strange, ugly facial features and large ears that looked like the wings of a bat. Their most distinguishing feature was their monstrously sized left arm, a thick, knotted behemoth of a limb, better fit for a [[giant]] than a creature of their size. Their other arm seemed puny and weak in comparison but was just as powerful as that of a regular [[human]]. At any time, they were likely wearing a cape to disguise either one of their limbs.",
        "Description": "Yagnoloths were horrifying humanoids that stood {{SIrange|10|15|ft}} and were covered in red scales.

Their other arm seemed puny and weak in comparison but was just as powerful as that of a regular [[human]]. At any time, they were likely wearing a cape to disguise either one of their limbs.",
        "Personality": "Yagnoloths were corrupt and selfish entities that constantly abused their positions of authority. They were also indulgent and indolent, attempting to avoid any form of work for as long as possible while reaping the rewards of those beneath them. Despite their slothfulness, they were capable of being cunning if needed and knew how to establish control of a situation, usually through a display of power.\n\nFor beings that demonstrated such laziness they also displayed an inordinate amount of pride and an overblown estimation of their own self-worth. The source of their pride was their impression that they received special attention from the [[ultroloth]]s, not realizing that every other caste of yugoloth above them got the same treatment. Their vainglorious attitudes and sense of invincibility gave them tremendous levels of pride that on one hand made them difficult to deal with, but on the other was a source of potential manipulation.",
        "Abilities": "Even without a weapon the massive clawed arm of a yagnoloth was dangerous, able to beat in or tear up their enemies with brutal efficiency. The impact from their fists was strong enough that most beings struck by it were stunned for over a minute straight. Their bodies were sturdy enough that most earth-based effects were ineffective against them. Every now and then, they could release a cloud of acidic gas that painfully melted exposed skin and was also capable of stunning foes.\n\nTheir various stunning powers acted in conjunction with their most horrifying power, the ability to drain life force. By touching their head against an incapacitated foe, yagnoloths could sap the vitality out of a creature and potentially kill them. The drain lasted until the yagnoloth died if it had happened within 1 day but otherwise the victim would need magical restoration or serious rest. The process took approximately half a minute and if interrupted would not harm the victim.\n\nThey had several innate spells they could cast. At will, they could cast ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[suggestion]]''. They also had eletrical powers ranging in power from ''[[shocking grasp]]'' to ''[[lightning bolt]]'' levels.",
        "Combat": "Yagnoloths were proficient in the use of several types of weapons, such as maces, [[greatsword]]s, [[greataxe]]s and harpoons.\n\nTheir normal strategy in combat was to immobilize the most powerful enemy and repeatedly plunge their weapons into them until the foe stopped moving, before checking to see if the remaining enemies had fled after seeing the vicious display. Normally they wielded weapons with their puny arm but never magical ones with special abilities. Possession of such a tool was a large enough asset that it might prompt the yagnoloth's minions to rebel and assassinate them in order to obtain it.",
        "Society": {
            "The Abyss": "Yagnoloths could also be found within the [[Abyss]], mostly in [[Morglon-Daar]] near the [[Blood Rift]], in positions of similar authority. They were allowed to exile or execute any being threatening stability within the city and were the closest thing to a system of law and justice within the realm. They also worked for demons as enforcers and guards or traveled in isolated bands throughout the far reaches of the Blood Sea. If found in the Material Plane it was often due to being bound by a spellcaster or to engage in their other duty, the writing of contracts for other yugloths.",
            "Promotion": "[[Hydroloth]]s who strove to be promoted in order to escape their expendable station were immediately met by the inherent trap of the yagnoloth caste. For the first time in a yugoloth's life they were given the authority and power to exercise their own free will at a whim. It was the corrupting nature of power that stopped most yugoloths from further advancing. In order to become [[merrenoloth]]s they had to recognize that despite being provided power over land and life they did not possess true power, and were limited by the wishes of their ultroloth overlords."
        },
        "Ecology": "Yagnoloths normally resided within Gehenna or Hades. They were occasionally found in the Abyss, usually in layers that were moist or with abundant water.",
        "History": "The origins of yagnoloths was somewhat speculative, with some believing it was the consequence of cross-mutation. Some theorized that yagnoloths had some racial relation to [[giant]]s.\n\nIt was believed by some that yagnoloths were created while the Abyss was still young and that they were formally a race of aquatic humanoids in service to the [[primordial]] [[Throan]]. Before he was slain, Throan supposedly transferred his spirit into his servants, transforming them into yagnoloths due to the Abyss's dark taint. Their smaller arms were the only things that remained of their once slender form."
