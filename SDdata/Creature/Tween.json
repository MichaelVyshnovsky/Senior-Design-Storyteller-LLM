        "mainbody": "'''Tweens''' were parasitic [[spirit]]s endemic to the [[Ethereal plane]], though they were not a type of [[undead]].",
        "Description": "When not attached to any host, tweens appeared on the [[Border Ethereal]] to those on the [[Prime Material plane]] as smoky or shadowy [[humanoid]] silhouettes. Typically this was reminiscent of a squat [[human]].",
        "Personality": "Tweens were very intelligent spirits, but they lacked goals or independent purposes.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Bonding": "All tweens sought out creatures on either the Prime Material or ethereal plane to bond with, having a preference for intelligent ones. They often took hosts that were humans or [[demihuman]]s.\n\nOnce a suitable host was found, tweens would shadow their target's every move. When this bonding action truly began, it would appear as a vaguely visible shadow adjacent to their host's own.  After several hours, the bonding became permanent, with neither the tween nor their host being capable of voluntarily severing it. If a tween's host were to die, it would cause such grief and shock for the spirit that it would fission into two tweens.",
            "Probability": "Tweens had the ability to subtly alter probability in the vicinity of their host, which extended out to roughly {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}, and they could see a few seconds into the future. Through these combined abilities a tween granted their host greater luck. However, this positive probability was robbed from others within their host's vicinity, whether they be enemies or allies, afflicting them with bad luck."
        },
        "Combat": "Tweens fought independently of their hosts when attacked on the Ethereal plane. They typically fought with some ethereal form of weapon, like a [[sword]]. Otherwise, they mimicked the actions of their hosts in combat.",
        "History": "Some scholars suspected that tweens were once members of a race that inhabited the [[Outlands]] known as the [[kyleen]], who had fled to the ethereal plane after a strange chaos plague transformed them.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, tweens were known to be lurking around the [[Shadowdale]] region.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, a group of [[Beshaban]]s operating a shrine in the [[sewers of Ravens Bluff]], that included [[Cleo of Bad Luck]] and [[Tinsel Reltether]], were all hosts to tweens.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Luck Takes a Vacation|10-12}}",
        "Society": {
            "Languages": "Tweens were capable of communicating telepathically with their host.",
            "Relationships": "Creatures bonded with tweens were considered a mixed blessing by those around them. This often led to the host becoming an outcast."
        },
        "Trivia": "* ''[[Zunzalor's harp]]'' could make a tween clearly visible, outlined by blue radiance."
