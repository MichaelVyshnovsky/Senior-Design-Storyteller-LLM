'''Vault guardians''' were a unique variety of [[construct]] that were created and sold by the [[wizard]]s of the [[Zhentarim]]. They were extremely valuable entities, costing upwards of 70,000 [[gp]] in materials and selling for over thrice that value.

==Description==
Vault guardians took the form of a variety of different creatures, from [[humanoid]]s to common animals such as [[dog]]s. Their stone and metal bodies were decorated with a pattern of inscriptions that formed patterns over their front limbs and foreheads.

==Abilities==
What set a vault guardian apart from other constructs, such as [[stone golem|stone]] or [[sand golem]]s was the myriad of magical abilities it possessed. At will, they could ''[[detect magic|readily detect and magical effects or auras]]'', ''[[See invisibility|catch sight]]'' of any ''[[invisibility|invisible]]'' creatures or items, and ''[[true seeing|see things as they truly were]]''.

==Combat==
A vault guardian made for a fairly straightforward combatant. It went directly after any foes and assailed them with its fists or forepaws. They were capable of reaching to both the [[Astral Plane|astral]] and [[ethereal plane]]s, and could harm beings that were typically only vulnerable to [[iron]], [[silver]], or [[Item enchantment|enchanted]],  weapons.

In addition to the various resistances and immunities they possessed as constructs, guardians were nearly entirely resistant to the elements. They were exceptionally vulnerable to [[Earth (element)|earth magic]] spells.

==Ecology==
As they were constructs, vault guardians had no need to rest, sleep, or eat. They could most often be found among the lords of [[Zhentil Keep]].

==History==
The first vault guardians were actually made by [[Sembia]]n mages and used to guard their mercantile companies. After some time, the secret of their creation was learned by members of the [[Zhentarim]].
