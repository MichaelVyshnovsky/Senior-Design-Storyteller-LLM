'''Herons''' were a species of water-wading bird found in the Realms.

==Description==
Their beaks had a similar shape to that of a [[boobrie]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Herons were generally found in habitats typical of water wading birds. These included marshes, swamps, lake verges, and along the banks of watercourses.

In [[interior Faer√ªn]], herons were quite common in the [[Farsea Marshes]]. In the [[Unapproachable East]], they could be found in the nation of [[Aglarond]] in the [[Tannath Gap]].
===Relationships===
Some swamp-based [[ranger]]s kept herons as [[animal companion]]s.
===Usages===
In the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], herons were one of many birds that [[the Raven's Glory]] dining club would serve to its patrons.<ref>
