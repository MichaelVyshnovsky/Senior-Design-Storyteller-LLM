        "mainbody": "he dartflash was a species of fish native to the Western Heartlands, in particular the River Reaching.\nThese fish had small, silver-scaled and bony bodies that were roughly the size of a humans hand. They were known to swim in short, very fast bursts.\nBeing an edible species, some creatures in the Western Heartlands were known to fish for dartflashes, usually netting or scooping them out of the water in handheld nets. They were later often steamed until their bones were soft enough to crunch and consume. Due to their small size, the average human adult required a large number of them to make a proper meal."
