        "mainbody": "The '''dartflash''' was a species of [[fish]] native to the [[Western Heartlands]], in particular the [[River Reaching]].",
        "Description": "These fish had small, silver-scaled and bony bodies that were roughly the size of a [[human]]'s hand. They were known to swim in short, very fast bursts.",
        "Ecology": "Being an edible species, some creatures in the Western Heartlands were known to fish for dartflashes, usually netting or scooping them out of the water in handheld nets. They were later often steamed until their bones were soft enough to crunch and consume. Due to their small size, the average human adult required a large number of them to make a proper meal."
