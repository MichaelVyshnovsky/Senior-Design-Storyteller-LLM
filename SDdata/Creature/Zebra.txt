'''Zebras''' were a species of wild [[horse]] related to the more common domestic breeds of horses.

==Description==
Zebras were distinguished from other species of horses by the striking patterns their fur displayed&mdash;broad, alternating, vertical stripes of black and white.

Rather than having the neigh or whinny common among other equine species, zebras uniquely displayed a distinctive "bark".

==Behavior==
Being a type of wild horse, zebras had a disposition that was greatly counter to domestication.

==Species==
* [[Shaaran zebra]]: A regional variety of zebra that was endemic to the plains of [[Shaar]] and [[Eastern Shaar]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
In [[west Faerûn]], zebras could be found in the hilly grasslands surrounding the [[city-state]] of [[Cursrah]] and in the aforementioned plains of the Shaar.

Beyond [[Faerûn]], zebras inhabited the plains of the [[Rayana Savanna]] and [[Yaku Plains]] atop the [[Malatran Plateau]]{{Cite living jungle/Living Jungle Campaign: Player Information Guide|5}}{{Cite polyhedron/102/The Living Jungle|7}} and large herds of them could be found in the savannahs of [[Chult]].

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], zebras could be found in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], particularly the level of [[Krigala]].

===Relationships===
Zebras were one of the primary animals that [[wemic]]s{{Cite dragon/157/The Ecology of the Wemic|49}} and [[lion]]s hunted. Some [[gnoll]] tribes were also known to hunt zebras, but these had the animal as a religious [[totem]] and would often sacrifice them to their lord [[Yeenoghu]].{{Cite dragon/173/The Sociology of the Flind|82}}

[[Hybsil]]s were often on good terms with zebras.{{Cite_book/Monster_Manual_II_(1983)|77}}

Despite the inherent difficulty in domesticating them,
