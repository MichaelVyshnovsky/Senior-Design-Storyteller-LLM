'''Lightning golems''' were a type of greater [[golem]].
==Description==
Lightning golems were [[humanoid]] in shape and made from [[gold]]. Their movements were the same as a regular humanoid. Crackling electrical discharges were constantly present around its body.
==Abilities==
Lightning golems had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[chain lightning]]'' spell, able to lash out with electricity to a target within {{SI|50|yd}}. It was immune to most spells that affected living creatures as well as psionics. It was also immune to cold, electrical, ice, lightning and mind-based effects and spells. It remained vulnerable to effects and spells which targeted metals, as well as heat.
==Combat==
Lightning golems used their powerful arms to smash a target. Any opponent who came into physical contact with a lightning golem received a vicious electrical shock.
==Ecology==
Only the most powerful [[wizard]] could create a lightning golem. It was an extremely expensive process. The body of a lightning golem required {{SI|2000|lb|k}} of gold alone, and the cost of the gold and the other materials required could cost up to 150,000 [[gp]]. Constructing the body took up to ten weeks. The wizard then had to infuse the body with an elemental spirit. This required the wizard to cast ''[[chain lightning]]'', ''[[enchant an item]]'', ''[[geas]]'', ''[[permanency]]'' and ''[[wish]]'' spells, all in an open location during a fierce storm. If successful, a massive bolt of lightning struck the golem's body, infusing it with a powerful elemental spirit.
