A '''mineral warrior''' was a type of creature that had [[Earth (element)|elemental earth]] as part of their being.

Creatures turned into mineral warriors were often called '''stony creatures'''; for example, [[Hamatula]]s that had been turned into mineral warriors were [[stony devil]]s.

==Creation==
A mineral warrior was not born naturally. Rather, it was a creature that had subjected itself to transformation [[magic]] to become a mineral warrior. It could not be a [[construct]], [[elemental]], or [[undead]].

==Description==
They looked like petrified versions of themselves, but this had no effect on their agility.

==Personality==
As a general rule, a mineral warrior was a creature that had willingly become one. However, some became mineral warriors because they'd been forced into the transformation by a member of an evil race from the [[Underdark]].

==Combat==
Becoming a mineral warrior provided a lot of benefits for the one who became one. They could burrow through the ground as fast as they could walk. However, they lost all ability to fly naturally.

Their skin became tougher and even when an opponent managed to effectively hit a mineral warrior, it was hard to hurt them unless they used an [[adamantine]] [[weapon]].

A mineral warrior gained [[darkvision]].

A mineral warrior gained enhanced physical strength and durability, but all aspects of their mental capacity dropped. It was even possible for the creature to drop to animal intelligence.

The most devastating attack of a mineral warrior was called ''earth attack''. This attack was only usable against creatures who stood on stone or earth. It was a vicious attack that became more accurate as the durability of the mineral warrior increased.

==History==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[spell]] ''[[mineralize warrior]]'' had been developed that changed a willing [[humanoid]] into a mineral warrior.
