Sphinxes were a race of intelligent, immortal magical beasts. It was said that they once held a vast kingdom given to them by the gods in an effort to teach mortals the way of truth. The sphinxes had their own methods, however, by teaching mortals to think for themselves with riddles and parables. Four common subraces of sphinx included the androsphinx, criosphinx, gynosphinx, and hieracosphinx.
All sphinxes had leonine bodies with great feathery wings.
Sphinxes tended to be very solitary creatures and were territorial. Many made their lairs within the ruins of ancient civilizations or in isolated caves. Alignment among sphinx subraces differed vastly androsphinx were known for their good nature, while hieracosphinx were inherently evil.
Sphinxes spoke their own language as well as Common and Draconic.
Androsphinxes were a male subrace of sphinx, with the body of male lions, masculine humanoid faces, and massive wings. They were physically powerful creatures with inherent magical powers and a terrifying roar. While they tended to be short-tempered and terse, androsphinxes possessed good-natured ideals and always attempted to do the right thing.
A gynosphinx was a female sphinx, with a winged female lion body and feminine humanoid facial features. While not as physically powerful as an androsphinx, the gynosphinx was still a capable combatant and possessed a number of magical powers. The gynosphinx was the sole female sphinx subrace.
Gynosphinxes preferred to pursue intellectual ideals. They loved to collect knowledge and ancient lore, and delight in solving riddles, puzzles and mental challenges.
