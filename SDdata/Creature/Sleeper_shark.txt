Sleepers sharks were a large species of shark found in the Sea of Moving Ice.
These creatures were named for their sluggish movements, which were thought to be the result of poor eyesight caused by parasites.
Sleeper sharks lived extraordinarily long lives.
Though not proven, sleepers sharks were thought to grow slowly over the course of their lives and never stop growing.
