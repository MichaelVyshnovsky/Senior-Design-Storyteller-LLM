        "mainbody": "'''Hu hsien''' were a type of shapechanging feminine spirit native to [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "Hu hsien could take one of two forms, and could shapechange freely between the two. The first form was that of a [[fox]] with rusty or silvery fur, though unlike a fox a hu hsien could stand on her hindlegs and hold objects with her front paws.\n\nThe second form was that of a human maiden of exceptional grace and beauty, with long and flowing hair and wearing [[silk|silken]] robes. However, they retained a fox-like tail in this form, though they typically took care to hide it under their robes. In this form, hu hsien were about {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Personality": "Hu hsien were cunning, manipulative, and cruel, though not entirely ungrateful to those were were generous or kind to them. They valued wealth.",
        "Abilities": "Hu hsien could use a number of spell-like abilities at will, including ones akin to: ''[[become invisible]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[disguise]]'', ''[[Chameleon (spell)|chameleon]]'', ''[[know history]]'', ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[ventriloquism]]'', ''[[Apparition (spell)|apparition]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', and ''[[hypnotic pattern]]''. Once per day, a hu hsien could use spell-like abilities akin to ''[[possess]]'', ''[[servant horde]]'', and ''[[major creation]]''. Thrice each week, one could use either ''[[reward]]'' or ''[[ancient curse]]''. While in human form, a hu hsien had the power of ''[[fascination]]''.\n\nHu hsien also possessed certain defensive abilities: they could only be harmed by strongly enchanted weapons, possessed limited regeneration, were immune to fire, and were resistant to the cold and ice. However, they were vulnerable to electricity.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Outside of Kara-Tur, hu hsien were known to occasionally be found in the western regions of the [[Hordelands]]."
