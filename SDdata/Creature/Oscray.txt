'''Oscray''' were a group of [[scro]] found on the [[Ravannah Savannah]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]].Though [[scro]] were not specifically named in their entry, the description and background of oscray heavily mirrors them. In addition, they reuse the art used for scro in ''[[Monstrous Compendium Spelljammer Appendix II]]''. Also, the word "oscray" is the word "scro" in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin pig latin].

==Description==
Scro bore a resemblance to the average [[orc]], but were larger and had greyish skin. They had tusks, which were often filed to a sharp point.

==Personality==
The minds of oscray were typically well suited to combat, being disciplined and having a type of cunning that was rooted in strategy and tactics. They always looked out for each other above all else.

==Combat==
Oscray were known to fight with the typical Malatran weaponry of [[dagger]]s, [[handaxe]]s, [[shortbow]]s, long [[knives]], [[long spear]]s, and [[half-spear]]s.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Iron Will/Certificates}} They often made a point to insult their enemies. They forged [[chainmail]] and many weapons from [[brass]].

==History==
The oscray were descended from a group of scro who had fled on [[spelljammer|spelljamming vessels]] from their far off [[Second Unhuman War|war]] with the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]].<ref group="note" name="note2" />

==Society==
The oscray engaged in some level of agriculture, though they primarily relied upon hunting.{{Cite polyhedron/129/Agriculture, Invention, and Society in Malatra|31}}

===Homelands===
All oscray lived within a village in the [[Ravannah Savannah]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]], well to the north of the territory of the [[Wise Ones]] tribe of [[Nubari]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Iron Will|14}}
===Relationships===
At first the oscray relied upon smelting down their own possessions and stripping down their spelljammers for brass, but eventually established trade relations with the [[aarakocra]] of the [[Forbidden Mountains]]. The aarakocra would scan the mountains for any raw copper ore they could find and once they collected {{SI|20|lb|long=yes}} worth of copper they would make the long trek to the oscray village. They traded this copper with the oscray in return for brass [[javelin]] heads, which were considered an item of prestige among the aarakocra of the Forbidden Mountains.

==Notable==
* [[Bentfang]], chieftain of the oscray.
* [[One-Arm]], the master smith of the oscray.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Iron Will|9-10}}
