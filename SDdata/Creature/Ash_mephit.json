        "mainbody": "sh mephits were a variety of mephit composed of ash.\nThese mephits had powdery gray skin and lacked external ears. Whenever they spoke, it came out in a nasally whining tone.\nAsh mephits had a perpetually depressed and gloomy disposition. They often subjected people to near-endless tales of their sorrows, boredom, and frustrations.\nAsh mephits were capable of spraying a cloud of choking ash in a  radius. They could gate in another of their kind once per hour. And they had an innate ability to, once per day, rally a group of good and neutrally aligned creatures into a distracting conversation, similar to the spell Leomunds lamentable belaborment.\nThey were immune to all forms of poison. They were impervious to harm from spells and abilities based around fire, heat, and cold. They were especially vulnerable to spells and abilities based around liquids or wind. When it came to weapons, they could only be harmed by slashing and piercing weapons that were enchanted.\nUnlike some types of mephit, this variety was incapable of fighting by means of biting or clawing.\nAsh mephits were largely solitary creatures, Such societies were little more than war-like hunting packs.\nThese mephits regularly preyed upon the rasts of their home plane, who in turn preyed upon them.\nAsh mephits sometimes acted as servants of the deity Laduguer."
