        "Personality": "Ash mephits had a perpetually depressed and gloomy disposition. They often subjected people to near-endless tales of their sorrows, boredom, and frustrations.",
        "Abilities": "Ash mephits were capable of spraying a cloud of choking ash in a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius. They could ''[[gate]]'' in another of their kind once per hour. And they had an innate ability to, once per day, rally a group of [[good]] and [[neutral]]ly aligned creatures into a distracting conversation, similar to the [[spell]] ''[[Leomund's lamentable belaborment]]''.\n\nThey were immune to all forms of [[poison]]. They were impervious to harm from [[spell]]s and abilities based around [[fire]], heat, and cold. They were especially vulnerable to spells and abilities based around liquids or wind. When it came to weapons, they could only be harmed by slashing and piercing weapons that were [[item enchantment|enchanted]].",
        "Combat": "Unlike some types of mephit, this variety was incapable of fighting by means of biting or clawing.",
