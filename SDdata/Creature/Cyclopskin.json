        "mainbody": "A cyclopskin (|audio=Cyclopskin.ogg) was a smaller version of a cyclops.\nThe typical cyclopskin stood around  and weighed around .\nThey typically dressed in dirty garments that were made of animal hide.\nIn combat, most cyclopskin preferred to use bardiches, clubs, over-sized slings, and spears. The latter two were only used when needing to attack from afar or when out hunting. Because of their poor depth perceptions, cyclopskin were not good with did not use missile weapons. Thus, unlike other giant-kin, they were not skilled with throwing boulders.\nAll cyclopskin believed they descended from the strong line of Annam, but most giants suspected these runts came from one of Otheas affairs.\nMuch like their larger cousins, cyclopskin had a highly patriarchal society, with women and children being subservient to men. The strongest among them generally assumed the leadership role and were most often killed by other members of their clan who had grown bitter from mistreatment.\nCyclopskin generally lived alone or traveled in small bands looking for prey and suitable captives.\nCyclopskin were known to be susceptible to all forms of lycanthropy and retained their distinctive single eye regardless of which form they took.\nA number of such bands lived in Starspur in the Starspire Mountains of Tethyr. They were also known to occasionally be found in the eastern region of the Hordelands."
