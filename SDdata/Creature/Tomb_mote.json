        "mainbody": "Tomb motes were tiny undead creatures that resembled humanoids created out of clumps of tomb litter and waste.\nThese imp-like undead beings were spontaneously-risen animated being of bone shards, loose teeth, hair balls, and cracked shards of tombstones and grave dirt. They reached  in height and weighted from  to .\nTomb motes were carriers of the disease known as corpse bloat. Each bite landed by these tiny undead creatures could be deadly with the infections incubation rate taking up to three days to present itself, turning the infected skin green and sprouting feverish bloats.\nTomb motes could comprehend Common and Abyssal languages but were unable to speak.\nFor creatures of grave dirt, tomb motes were smart, savage, and impishly mischievous. Their behaviors varied from being malicious and evil to being a nuisance to grieving graveyard visitors.\nDue to their diminutive size, tomb motes sprang to attack their targets from ambush, preferring to overwhelm them with motes numbers. Tiny and quick, they relayed on their diseased bites and lightning-quick movements in combat. They took to shadows, avoiding tougher opponents, quickly retreating if met with a creature beyond their swarming attacks strength..\nTomb motes were known to spring to unlife in the magic-rich mass burial sites, graveyards, and tombs. Their creation was sparked by places flush with dark necromancy magic and undead activity.\nTomb motes were known to haunt the mega-dungeon of Undermountain in the years that followed the Spellplague."
