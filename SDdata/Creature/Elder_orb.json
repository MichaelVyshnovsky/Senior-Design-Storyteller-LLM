        "mainbody": "Elder orbs were very old and powerful beholders.\nElder orbs were between . They lost their eyes over time, being unable to regenerate them, but gained wizardly powers instead. They were extremely intelligent.\nElder orbs were generally the councilors or leaders of the beholder faction they lived in.\nElder orbs ate less food than other beholders and thus were able to tolerate more foods, including poison. The elder orbs body itself had a high level of magic resistance and could easily see through most illusions.\nIt was believed that elder orb brains could be used to create great spells and magical items.\nElder orbs were immortal beholders. They were born like any other beholder and were&mdash apart from inborn sorcerous abilities &mdashindistinguishable from others. The differences became apparent with very advanced age. From some point onwards, an elder orb stopped growing physically weaker from age and continued to live on forever until it suffered a violent death. They never went senile. Compared to other beholders, an elder orb was big and strong but also less agile.\nElder orbs were powerful spellcasters, although they were restricted to verbal spells that they developed on their own or stole from others. They guarded their knowledge jealously.\nElder orbs were able to control death tyrants with their magic, as well as create them. They preferred to use the death tyrants to do their dirty work for them, including fighting enemies.\n* Arglath\n* Irixis\n* Skixtalq\n* Vaxall\n* Xanathar"
