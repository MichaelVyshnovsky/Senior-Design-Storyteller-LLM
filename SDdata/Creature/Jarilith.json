        "Description": "Jariliths resembled large male [[lion]]s with slightly oversized teeth and claws. Their demonic nature was made evident by their blood-red fur.\n\n<!--==Behavior==-->",
        "Abilities": "Jariliths were hunters, and their natural gifts broadly reflected that: they were exceptionally good at hiding and moving silently, were comfortable in a variety of terrains ranging from forest to desert and wastes (or the versions thereof found in the Abyss), and had both [[darkvision]] and a keen sense of smell. They had at-will magical abilities that were similar to the spells ''[[clairaudience/clairvoyance]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', and ''[[doom]]''. In addition, once each day a jarilith could attempt to summon another jarilith to its aid.\n\nShaped as they were by nightmares, their very presence inspired fear. But their primary weapons were themselves: like great cats they stalked, and pounced, and rended their prey apart with claw and fang.",
        "Ecology": "Like all tanar'ri, jariliths were native to the Abyss, where they preferred hunting other demons. They were difficult to control and could sense weakness in others, and to them even other demons seemed weak. They were recorded to live alone, in pairs, or in prides of up to ten adults. They understood the [[Abyssal language]] but did not speak; among themselves they communicated via [[telepathy]].\n\nJariliths were among the creatures used as hunting beasts by more powerful entities visiting the Abyssal layer of [[Spirac]].<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Codex I, Part 2: The Lost Annals/Additional Layers}}",
        "History": "A number of jariliths served the [[Lords of Dust]] as they plotted to free the [[Spinner of Shadows]] in [[Eberron]], and also defended the Spinner in [[Spinner's Prison|her prison]] when the [[Church of the Silver Flame]] attempted to stop her from escaping.\n\nDuring the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]], jariliths were among the summoned monsters used as gladiatorial beasts in the [[Underdark Arena]] of the [[red dragon]] [[Aptoryx]]."
