'''Ghostwise halflings''', also called '''ghostwise hin''', were the least common of [[Toril]]'s three major halfling subraces.

<!--==Description==-->
==Personality==
Ghostwise halflings were generally very concerned (some might say obsessed) with family and clan. They do not experience as much wanderlust as the other halflings subraces.

==Abilities==
This subrace of halflings had the unique ability to communicate [[telepathy|telepathically]] with any creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of them that spoke the same language.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionic Races and Classes (Ghostwise Halflings, Githyanki, Mind Flayers, Yuan-ti, and Psionic Bestiary)}}

==Combat==
Many ghostwise halflings were [[barbarian]]s. In the Chondalwood, some ghostwise halfling warriors became [[nightglider]]s, warriors who rode [[giant owl]]s.

==Society==
Ghostwise halflings were very elusive and were generally isolated from the outside world. They often lived a nomadic life in clans. Those who left the clan often carried a token of some important natural feature in their clan's territory, such as a stone or a vial of water from a stream. Losing one's token was considered a sin and required an act of atonement assigned by the clan leader.

Ghostwise halflings worshiped [[Yondalla's Children]], the halfling pantheon. Most of the tribes of the Chondalwood chose either [[Sheela Peryroyl]] or [[Urogalan]] as their particular patron.

==History==
===[[Hin Ghostwars]]===
Along with the [[lightfoot halfling|lightfoots]] and [[strongheart halfling|stronghearts]], ghostwise halflings were one of the original tribes of the [[Lluirwood]] in [[Luiren]].

Around {{Yearlink|-100}}, a ghostwise halfling cleric named [[Desva]] began leading the ghostwise in the worship of [[Malar]] and violence, performing savage acts on the creatures and other halflings of the forest. In {{Yearlink|-68}}, the stronghearts and lightfoots allied against the ghostwise and battle continued for years until [[Chand]] of the stronghearts slew Desva in {{Yearlink|-65}}. Most of the surviving ghostwise left Luiren for the [[Chondalwood]], making an oath that they wouldn't speak until they had atoned for their savagery.
