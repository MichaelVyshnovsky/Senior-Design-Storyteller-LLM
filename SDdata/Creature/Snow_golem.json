        "mainbody": "'''Snow golems''' were a type of [[golem]] made from snow.",
        "Description": "Snow golems were a mound of snow animated by [[magic]] that could be sculpted in any shape their creators wished. They often resembled white [[marble]] statues of [[humanoid]]s wearing terrifying [[helmet]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Snow golems were immune to the cold and were unaffected by poisons. They were also immune to charm, fear, paralyzation, petrifying or [[poison]]-based effects and spells. If it was attacked by a cold-based effect or spell, it absorbed the magical energy and used that to heal any injuries. [[Spell]]s that altered the form or structure of a creature had no effect on snow golems. In addition, they were not hurt by mundane weapons, which only harmlessly passed through them, but only by [[magic weapon]]s. They were, however, very vulnerable to any heat source, mundane or magical.\n\nAlthough incapable of speaking, snow golems were usually accompanied by a haunting sound of mournful wind.",
        "Combat": "In combat, a snow golem used its weight to slam into a target. They also used snowballs as a ranged weapon, possibly from surrounding snow or created magically from their own bodies.",
        "Society": "It was rumored that snow golems who had freed themselves from the control of their masters and achieved free will could form small communities with others of their kind.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Creation": "Producing a snow golem was a process that involved components and materials worth 45,000 [[gp]]. Over four weeks, the body was sculpted out of snow in a very cold location. Animation was achieved by casting the spells ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', ''[[wish]]'', and ''[[permanency]]''."
