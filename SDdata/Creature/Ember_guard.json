        "mainbody": "'''Ember guards''' were evil, dim-witted creatures made of incandescent rock. Unquestioningly obedient, they were frequently employed as guards by servants of [[Imix]] and [[Deep Duerra]].",
        "Description": "From the exterior, ember guards were similar to [[earth elemental]]s, with rocky bodies encrusted with [[brass]] deposits. However, this shell hid their true fiery nature, which was given away by their eyes and mouths that were constantly ablaze, emitting an acidic smoke. They emanated extreme heat from their bodies, especially when wounded.",
        "Personality": "The main purpose of ember guards, and a source of great joy for them, was to spread pain and suffering. They eagerly attacked anyone who approached them, and had no qualms about rushing headlong into the thick of battle. They had no sense of companionship or empathy, but were extremely obedient to any creature that seemed to be an authority.",
        "Combat": "The most devastating weapon possessed by ember guards was their [[fire]] breath, which also had the effect of slowing down its targets, similarly to the ''[[slow]]'' [[spell]]. Their bodies were extraordinarily resistant against damage, and the extreme heat irradiated by them when wounded was capable of searing nearby creatures. They were, however, particularly vulnerable to cold. When killed, ember guards exploded, blasting everything within a {{SIAdj|60|ft}} radius with fire and debris.",
        "Society": "Ember guards were commonly bestowed by Imix as a gift to his servants. They were typically found in the service of [[efreet]] as escorts, guards, and mercenaries.\n\nThe forges of [[Hammergrim]] were also known to produce ember guards, who were employed by Deep Duerra as torturers in the catacombs underneath the [[Citadel of Thought]]. Their laughter and the screams of their victims could be heard throughout the tunnels.",
        "Ecology": "Ember guards spawned from lakes of fire in the Elemental Plane of Fire, either by Imix's command or sometimes spontaneously, near the intersection with the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. They needed no nourishment."
