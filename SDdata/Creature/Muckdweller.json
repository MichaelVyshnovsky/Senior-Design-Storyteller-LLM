        "mainbody": "Muckdwellers were small amphibian people that lived in marshes.\nMuckdwellers were bipeds, with mottled gray and brown skin and a pale yellow underbelly. The tail was short, they had webbed feet, and small, weak arms.\nMuckdwellers were cowards, but they were also recorded to be cruel and orderly.\nMuckdwellers could squirt water from their mouths, generally going for the eyes of opponents. They were as capable in water as out of it.\nMuckdwellers preferred to ambush other creatures as groups.\nMuckdwellers were diurnal and omnivorous they generally ate insects, plants, fish, and even carrion, although most preferred fresh, warm-blooded meat. They lived 9â€“12 years on average as amphibians, they had a larval stage spent wholly in the water for the first three years of their life. Muckdwellers in temperate climates hibernated during winter.\nMuckdwellers normally served kuo-toa or lizardfolk tribes, living on the peripheries of such societies They were omnivorous creatures that built rafts of reeds, twigs, and mud on which they slept and hunted.\nMuckdwellers were recorded as living alongside lizardfolk across much of Faerun, from the Mere of Dead Men to the Great Swamp of Rethild, from the Lizard Marsh to the Surmarsh. They were especially prevalent among the lizardfolk of Kalran as slaves. In the Underdark, muckdwellers were known to live in kuo-toa population centers such as Gathgoolgapool."
