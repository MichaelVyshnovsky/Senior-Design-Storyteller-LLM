        "mainbody": "'''Muckdwellers''' were small amphibian people that lived in marshes.",
        "Description": "Muckdwellers were bipeds, with mottled gray and brown skin and a pale yellow underbelly. The tail was short, they had webbed feet, and small, weak arms.",
        "Behavior": "Muckdwellers were cowards, but they were also recorded to be cruel and orderly.",
        "Abilities": "Muckdwellers could squirt water from their mouths, generally going for the eyes of opponents. They were as capable in water as out of it.",
        "Combat": "Muckdwellers preferred to ambush other creatures as groups.",
        "Society": "Muckdwellers were diurnal and omnivorous; they generally ate insects, plants, fish, and even carrion, although most preferred fresh, warm-blooded meat. They lived 9â€“12 years on average; as amphibians, they had a larval stage spent wholly in the water for the first three years of their life. Muckdwellers in temperate climates hibernated during winter.\n\nMuckdwellers normally served [[kuo-toa]] or [[lizardfolk]] tribes, living on the peripheries of such societies They were omnivorous creatures that built rafts of reeds, twigs, and mud on which they slept and hunted.\n\nMuckdwellers were recorded as living alongside lizardfolk across much of [[Faerun]], from the [[Mere of Dead Men]] to the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]], from the [[Lizard Marsh]] to the [[Surmarsh]]. They were especially prevalent among the lizardfolk of [[Kalran]] as slaves. In the [[Underdark]], muckdwellers were known to live in kuo-toa population centers such as [[Gathgoolgapool]]."
