'''Cheetahs''' were large [[feline]]s known for their speed.

==Description==
Cheetahs were slender and long, their bodies designed to reach high speeds and leap great distances. The coloration of their fur allowed them to blend into their habitat seamlessly. Unlike most cats, cheetahs were unable to retract their claws.

==Biology==
Cheetah's were the fastest natural land animals known to scholars of [[Toril]], able to attain speeds of nearly {{SIspeed|60|mph|k|h|long=yes}} when sprinting.This value is calculated using v.3.5 rules. For comparison, the fastest horses in v.3.5—the [[Calimite]], [[Chionthar (horse)|Chionthar]], [[Dambraii]], [[Lhesperan]], and [[Raurin (horse)|Raurin]]—can reach {{SIspeed|40|mph|k|h}}. <br />In the real world, some horses can reach speeds of over {{SIspeed|50|mph|k|h}}, and cheetahs have been clocked well over {{SIspeed|60|mph|k|h}}, but v.3.5 consistently gives lower maximum speeds for animals, likely because the ''Monster Manuals'' include representatives of average specimens.

==Combat==
Cheetahs were skilled hunters and used their speed and jumping ability to tackle prey. Their sharp claws and fangs were deadly natural weapons. They could jump up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} horizontally and {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} vertically. Cheetahs were especially dangerous when protecting their cubs, for which they fought to the death in their defense.

==Ecology==
Cheetahs were territorial creatures, but often lived with others of their kind. Female cheetahs had litters of up to four cubs, who remained by her side for two years.
===Diet===
Cheetahs were obligate carnivores and targeted [[antelope]]s as their primary source of food. They rarely attacked [[humanoid]]s for food.
===Habitats===
These creatures were typically could be found in warm grasslands and prairies.

Cheetahs were found on the plains in [[Durpar]], [[Estagund]], [[Halruaa]], [[Semphar]], the Shaar, [[Var]], Some cheetahs also lived within the forest of [[Cormanthor]].
===Relationships===
Cheetahs were the only great cat species that could be properly domesticated.

==Notable Cheetahs==
