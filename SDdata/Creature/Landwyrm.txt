Landwyrms were a type of lesser, wingless dragon, each species of which was near-perfectly adapted to its environment.
Landwyrms were large, wingless dragons. Their appearance varied greatly between species.
Landwyrms were strong-willed and had independent natures.
Like other dragons, landwyrms emanated a fear-inducing aura.
Although all landwyrm species had different ways of fighting, they all tended to favor stealth and surprise. Additionally, they saw nothing wrong with fleeing a battle only to return later. They were skilled trackers.
All landwyrms were specific to different environments, to which they were extremely well-adapted. They possessed great knowledge about their environments and were known to share this knowledge if approached peacefully.
Landwyrms were among the creatures effected by the Dracorage, and would form flights along with wyverns, chromatic dragons, and elemental drakes, that destroyed everything they came across.
There were at least nine species of landwyrms, each of them not-so-creatively named after the environment which they inhabited. Known species of landwyrms included the desert landwyrm, forest landwyrm, hill landwyrm, jungle landwyrm, mountain landwyrm, plains landwyrm, swamp landwyrm, tundra landwyrm, and Underdark landwyrm.
