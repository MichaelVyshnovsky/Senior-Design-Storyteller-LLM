            "Subraces": "[[File:Bariaur3eB.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''An exalted bariaur [[ranger]].'']]\nA larger and more powerful breed of bariaur existed that were known as \"exalted bariaurs\". Their greater power was said to come from a closer connection to the rulers of the [[Upper Planes]]. Exalted bariaurs were much bulkier, weighing upwards of {{SI|800|pounds|k|long=yes}}, and were numbered among the true [[celestial]]s."
        },
        "Personality": "Bariaurs tended toward a [[chaotic good]] worldview, but if not, they were almost never evil. Lovers of freedom, most bariaurs were full of wanderlust, but they also felt a desire to defend their home [[Cosmology|planes]] from evil. Their carefree attitudes sometimes caused those unfamiliar with them to find them irresponsible, but this was simply an outward sign of their wanderlust. When evil showed itself, a bariaur's carefree persona was replaced with the focused stance of a hunter.\n\nBariaurs were social beings and very outgoing. They were slow to trust while still giving individuals the benefit of the doubt. They got along very well with [[elves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s and [[aasimar]] who were not too rigid in their outlook. They would work with [[dwarves]] but were not overly fond of them. They found [[half-elves]] and [[half-orc]]s interesting and were suspicious of [[tiefling]]s. They had a hatred for most [[giant]]s, and on Ysgard would sometimes make an effort to destroy their lairs.\n\nLovers of play, bariaurs enjoyed competing in contests of all varieties, both mental and physical, enjoying everything from story-telling competitions to \"clashes of horns\" where they would charge each other in a sequence of attacks similar to a [[jousting]] match. They threw festivals with singing contests and played a sport similar to polo. They enjoyed the contests for their entertainment value and did not take most results too seriously. This love of contests extended to an eagerness to \"test\" visitors to their realm in such games. Bariaurs needed times of play as much as most creatures needed times of rest and would find times for games even on the most serious of epic quests of honor.\n\nBariaur were known for great courage; they feared little—except perhaps sadness. A bariaur would do everything in his or her power to help lessen the sadness of a friend, even if it meant traveling the planes.\n\nAs a rule, bariaurs paid a lot of attention to their appearance, making an effort to express their originality through their style of dress and choice of jewelry.",
        "Abilities": "Bariaurs were naturally resistant to many magical spells. They had keen senses and could [[Darkvision|see in the dark]]. Bariaurs were faster than [[human]]s.\n\nMales tended to be stronger and physically tougher than females, but they were less observant. Females were particularly intelligent and wise, as a rule, but were physically weaker than males. They had keener senses than males and were more resistant to magic. Neither sex were as agile as one might expect.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Bariaurs did not have their own native tongue, and instead spoke the [[Celestial language]] and [[Common]], primarily speaking the former amongst themselves. They occasionally learned the [[fiend]]ish languages to better prepare themselves for attacks from such creatures.\n\nBariaurs received their names from their parents, which were usually one or two syllables for ease of shouting across the hills. Within a flock, a male would use the patronym \"buck of\" to refer to his father, while a female would use \"doe of\" to show her relationship to her mother. When outside his or her flock, a bariaur would use a flock name.\n\nCommon male names included Bex, Hul, Jek, Menok, Ril, and Wyk. Common names for female bariaurs were Daeth, Hysh, Saph, Tyth, and Vash. Some typical flock names were Cloverfield, Dalewatcher, Hillwalker, and Woodstrider.",
            "Religion": "Most bariaurs of Ysgard worshiped Ehlonna, the goddess of the woodlands from the world of [[Oerth]], Others venerated gods of strength or the sun.",
            "Combat": "[[File:Bariaur3eA.jpg|thumb|175px|right|''A bariaur standing his ground.'']]\nMany bariaurs became rangers. A few were drawn to become [[fighter]]s or [[barbarian]]s. Males would sometimes become [[cleric]]s or [[paladin]]s but rarely [[wizard]]s, while females, on the other hand, favored either the [[Divine magic|divine]] or the [[Arcane magic|arcane arts]]. Whatever their skills, bariaurs were fierce combatants.\n\nAs soon as a male bariaur reached adulthood—as soon as his horns began to grow—he would never be found unarmed. Bariaur passed along clubs as family heirlooms, with generations of a family's history etched in runes upon the wood. To lose such a weapon brought with it great dishonor.\n\nMale bariaurs often began a fight by lowering their heads and charging with their thick, curled horns. When fighting as flocks, bariaurs employed archers to support their melee forces. Warriors often bore large clubs or [[scimitar]]s and archers used [[composite longbow]]s."

        "Ecology": "Bariaurs reached adulthood at 20 years of age and could live well past 200 years.",
