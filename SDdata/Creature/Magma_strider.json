        "mainbody": "Magma striders were one of the two more bestial species of magma beast.\nThese creatures had a very insectoid appearance, sporting six long spindly legs.\nMagma striders were the most relentless of magma beasts, willing to pursue their prey for countless miles.\nLike all magma beasts, striders were immune to the effects of petrification, had some resistance to fire, and were particularly vulnerable to cold-based spells and abilities.\nThey uniquely radiated an aura of intense heat.\nMagma striders fought their prey by charging and biting at them.\nFollowing the Spellplague, many magma striders made their way through elemental vortices and planar rifts into volcanic regions of Torils and the Underdark. magma striders could be found inhabiting Mount Hotenow.\nLike all magma beasts, striders were capable of speaking the Primordial language.\nMagma striders were occasionally bullied by magma brutes and magma hurlers into fighting alongside them. They were also often lured into serving fire archons, fire giants, salamanders, and even the occasional eye of flame.\nMagma striders could subsist on merely clay, ores, and even minor elementals. Though they preferred to hunt and feast upon organic creatures, savoring the taste of burned flesh. Whenever they killed a humanoid they would devour them whole, including their equipment.\nThese creatures were native to the Elemental Chaos."
