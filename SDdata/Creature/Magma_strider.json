        "Behavior": "Magma striders were the most relentless of magma beasts, willing to pursue their prey for countless miles.",
        "Abilities": "Like all magma beasts, striders were immune to the effects of petrification, had some resistance to [[fire]], and were particularly vulnerable to cold-based [[spell]]s and abilities.\n\nThey uniquely radiated an aura of intense heat.",
        "Combat": "Magma striders fought their prey by charging and biting at them.",
        "History": "Following the [[Spellplague]], many magma striders made their way through [[elemental vortex|elemental vortices]] and planar rifts into volcanic regions of [[Toril]]'s and the [[Underdark]]. magma striders could be found inhabiting [[Mount Hotenow]].",
        "Society": {
            "Languages": "Like all magma beasts, striders were capable of speaking the [[Primordial language]].",
            "Relationships": "Magma striders were occasionally bullied by [[magma brute]]s and [[magma hurler]]s into fighting alongside them. They were also often lured into serving [[fire archon]]s, [[fire giant]]s, [[salamander]]s, and even the occasional [[eye of flame]]."

        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Magma striders could subsist on merely clay, ores, and even minor elementals. Though they preferred to hunt and feast upon organic creatures, savoring the taste of burned flesh. Whenever they killed a [[humanoid]] they would devour them whole, including their equipment.",
            "Habitats": "These creatures were native to the [[Elemental Chaos]]."
