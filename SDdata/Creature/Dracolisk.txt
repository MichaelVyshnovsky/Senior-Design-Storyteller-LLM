A dracolisk was a crossbreed between a dragon and a basilisk.
Dracolisks were extremely rare. They resembled a mixture of (black) dragons and basilisks, especially in regards to how they attacked foes. Dracolisks were dark brown, six-legged creatures.
Generally, these crossbreeds were not as smart as their draconic counterparts, but were more intelligent than greater basilisks. They were able to fly as fast as they could run.
These dragon-basilisks were very stealthy, and could lie in wait for the right time to initiate combat.
Dracolisks made very tough foes. They made use of both the breath weapon of a dragon and the petrifying gaze of a basilisk. Dracolisks could also lash out with their strong arms, claws, and ferocious teeth. Their acidic breath had a range of  and they could gaze at their foes from up to  away.
It was written in ancient texts that dracolisks were a distinct species and potentially more common at such a time.
Though very rare, a fiendish male dracolisk (half&ndashblack dragon/half&ndashbasilisk) stalked the Underdark of Toril circa the 14 century DR. The powerful and bad-tempered being survived alone in the Underdark for decades, and preyed on rothé and drow. It also had the ability to smite good-aligned creatures, and was immune to acid, being put to sleep, or being paralyzed.
A few taverns and inns around Faerûn were named after the deadly dragon-like creatures, such as the Dracolisks Head in Calaunt, and the Dancing Dracolisk in Arabel, Cormyr.
