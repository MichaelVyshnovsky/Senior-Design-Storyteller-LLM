A '''dracolisk''' was a crossbreed between a [[dragon]] and a [[basilisk]].{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Campaigns|4}}

==Description==
Dracolisks were extremely rare. They resembled a mixture of ([[black dragon|black]]) dragons and basilisks, especially in regards to how they attacked foes. Dracolisks were dark brown, six-legged creatures.

Generally, these crossbreeds were not as smart as their draconic counterparts, but were more intelligent than greater basilisks. They were able to fly as fast as they could run.

==Combat==
These dragon-basilisks were very stealthy, and could lie in wait for the right time to initiate combat.

Dracolisks made very tough foes. They made use of both the [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] of a dragon and the [[petrification|petrifying]] gaze of a basilisk. Dracolisks could also lash out with their strong arms, claws, and ferocious teeth. Their [[acid]]ic breath had a range of {{SI|30|ft}} and they could gaze at their foes from up to {{SI|20|ft}} away.

==History==
It was written in ancient texts that dracolisks were a distinct species and potentially more common at such a time.

Though very rare, a [[fiendish]] male dracolisk (half&ndash;black dragon/half&ndash;basilisk) stalked the [[Underdark]] of [[Toril]] ''circa'' the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The powerful and bad-tempered being survived alone in the Underdark for decades, and preyed on [[rothé]] and [[drow]]. It also had the ability to smite [[good]]-aligned creatures, and was immune to acid, being put to sleep, or being paralyzed.

A few taverns and inns around [[Faerûn]] were named after the deadly dragon-like creatures, such as the [[Dracolisk's Head]] in [[Calaunt]], and the [[Dancing Dracolisk]] in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]].
