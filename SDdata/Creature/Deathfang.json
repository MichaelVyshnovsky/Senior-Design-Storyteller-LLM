        "mainbody": "Deathfangs were a type of undead created from the body of a flying snake.\nThese creatures measured the same length as a flying snake, around , but they had body wings that could not move as much air.\nDeathfangs lacked the acidic spittle of their living counterparts. Much like any undead they had an immunity to cold-based spells or abilities, as well as charm, hold, sleep, and death magic spells. Additionally, once they had their fangs sunk into an enemy a death fang could drain a foe of their positive energy.\nThey could only be mentally controlled or influenced by the one who created them. \nDeathfangs fought in a similar manner to living flying snakes.\nIn 1358 DR,This is derived from the date given in Cloak & Dagger for the death of Flaern Cragsmere, mentioned in the Undermountain Adventures booklet in this boxed set. deathfangs could be found in some of the monster filled pit traps of Undermountain.\nThere were a few different ways that a flying snake could be turned into a deathfang. One way, though rare, was by being killed by a vampire or greater undead. Another means was by evil priests and wizards with specialized knowledge, using spells such as create undead.\nThe use of death fangs in the Realms was largely limited to Calimshan and other areas in Faerûn that were south of the continents northwest region. \nSome evil-aligned necromancers took on deathfangs as familiars. And the serpent god Sseth was known to use them as servants, working through them."
