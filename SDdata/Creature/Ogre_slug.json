        "mainbody": "An '''ogre slug''' was a creature with the upper body of an [[ogre]] and the lower body of a large [[slug]].",
        "Description": "These creatures were considered to be uglier than typical ogres. Their heads, upper torsos, and arms were those of ogres, and the parts lower than this were those of slugs.",
        "Combat": "In addition to strikes dealt with their powerful arms, ogre slugs could spit a corrosive, [[acid]]ic saliva. The acid was so potent that it could potentially dissolve [[armor]] and other equipment, inflicting high damage. Ogre slugs were immune to the effects of such acid.\n\nTheir hide was rubbery and thick, and to a degree protected them from blows dealt with blunt [[weapon]]s.",
        "Society": "Ogre slugs laired in damp caverns, living in tribes. These tribes numbered from as little as twelve to over forty, and there may have been ogre slug [[shaman]]s among their ranks, each with access to healing, protection, and [[divination]] [[spell]]s.",
        "Ecology": "These creatures kept [[giant slug]]s as guards. Groups of ogre slugs were known to go on raids, which were led by a powerful leader. When raiding and scavenging, these monstrous hybrids much preferred to feast on [[human]] or [[demihuman]] flesh. They enjoyed the flesh of humans so much that they would much rather consume them immediately, rather than keep them as [[slave]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, ogre slugs dwelled in the [[Mages' Guild]] of [[Myth Drannor]]."
