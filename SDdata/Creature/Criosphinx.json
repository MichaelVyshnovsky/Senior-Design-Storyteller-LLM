        "mainbody": "Criosphinxes () were a type of ram-headed sphinx.\nLike other types of sphinx, these creatures had tawny lion bodies as large as a horse with large wings similar to that of a falcon. In addition, they were always male.\nCriosphinxes found wealth extremely attractive and would pursue it above all else if they couldnt find a gynosphinx. Because of their penchant for wealth, they enjoyed extorting tolls from travelers. They also had remarkable memories, at least in terms of remembering their treasure caches.\nUnlike other types of sphinxes, these creatures did not possess an innate spellcasting ability. Because of this, they relied upon their leonine claws and ram-horns in combat, and would forgo using their teeth. When fighting, their combat tactics were rather simple.\nLike most sphinxes, these creatures lived largely solitary lives. Though while searching for a mate, occasionally up to four of them could be found traveling together, each of them hoping to take her for themselves. Criosphinxes would bury their treasures in the ground as they traveled, often having several caches spread over a considerable area.\nWhenever a criosphinx mated with a gynosphinx, male children born of their union would also be criosphinxes.\nIt was a common practice among members of this species to add a descriptive adjective to their name.\nThese creatures were a carnivorous species. They would use their sharp teeth to rip chunks of meat from their prey and then swallow them whole.\nCriosphinxes were typically found in deserts\nIn Faer√ªn, they could be found in the Hullack Forest. In the Shining South they could be found in Dambrath, the Shaar, and the Toadsquat Mountains.\nThese creatures were capable of speaking Common, as well as the language of sphinxes and animals.\nCriosphinxes were known to act as servants of the deity Nephthys.\nCriosphinxes lusted after gynosphinxes and constantly sought them out, though the latter found them repulsive.\nAround 1374 DR, one could find criosphinxes stabled by the Zhentarim as mounts within the Temple in the Sky."
