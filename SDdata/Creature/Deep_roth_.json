        "mainbody": "Deep rothé were a variety of rothé that lived in the Underdark.\nDeep rothé were smaller than surface rothé, standing only 4 feet tall at the shoulder. They had shaggy brown coats that darkened to black near the legs and belly. Their hooves and horns were dark green or black and their eyes were yellow or pinkish.\nLike other rothé, deep rothé were usually found in herds of 11-20 individuals. They had the ability to magically create dancing lights to communicate with other members of their herd.\nDeep rothés favorite food was cave moss, which was only found in faerzress-rich regions. Otherwise, they ate nearly anything that grew in the Underdark, especially fungi, moss, and lichen. Due to their habitat and diet, they were immune to any harmful effects of mold and fungus. They were also resistant to enchantments.\nThe meat of deep rothé was considered more tender and less gamey than surface beef.\nDeep rothé could fight with both their teeth and horns. They were skittish and prone to stampeding, which could be quite dangerous for anyone in their path.\nRothé were staples in the Underdark and served the same purpose as cattle and sheep. such as Menzoberranzan, Phanlinksal, and Iltkazar."
