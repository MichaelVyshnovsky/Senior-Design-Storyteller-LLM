        "mainbody": "'''Scile''' ({{SingPl}}), also referred to as '''incandescents''', were ageless creatures of pure [[radiant energy]] native to the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance]] that subsisted upon colors, both the naturally reoccurring ones of the [[plane]] and those of non-native creatures.",
        "Description": "An individual scile was a minuscule mote of light, measuring roughly {{SI|0.01|in|c|long=yes}}.",
        "Abilities": "When working as a group, scile could drain the color from any creature within roughly {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of them in under a few minutes. This draining of color rendered the victim and their possessions transparent, making them effectively invisible to both themselves and others, and thus causing them to lose all awareness of their own body. This especially made it hard for [[spellcaster]] victims to use [[somatic component]]s. And any [[magic item]]s rendered transparent ceased to function until restored to their former state. This transparency could be cured with either ''[[dust of appearance]]'' or the ''[[remove curse]]'' [[spell]], though [[dye]]s and [[paint]]s were also said to gradually reverse the process.\n\nScile could only be harmed by weapons with a ''+1'' or greater [[enchantment]] and as they were pure energy the scile were unaffected by all [[magic]] that altered physical forms. This included magic that caused paralyzation, [[petrification]], [[polymorph]]ing, or disintegration. Physical barriers, such as those produced by ''[[wall of ice]]'' or ''[[wall of force]]'', could keep scile at bay and the ''[[darkness]]'' spell would drive them away.\n\nScile could telepathically communicate with any other scile in sight.",
        "Combat": "When hunting the scile typically traveled in clouds of around thirty or more individuals.",
        "Society": {
            "Sub-Races": "'''Ravagers of Color''' were a vastly more intelligent and [[chaotic evil]] breed of scile that were believed to exist within the deep reaches of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance, living apart from other scile. They differed from normal scile in that they would only drain a single color from a victim but, depending upon which color was drained, the victim suffered a different effect until cured of transparency.\n\nThe draining of orange caused a victim to become physically weaker, violet caused a reduction in intellect, green made a victim incapable of lying and prone to relating information about themselves, yellow caused them to suffer depression, red caused them to lose all motivation, and finally the draining of blue caused there to be a small chance the victim would fly into a frenzied rage once every day.",
            "Relationships": "Scile sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[Seldarine|elven deity]] [[Labelas Enoreth]].<ref>\n\nIn regards to other natives of their plane, they were considered by [[radiance quasi-elemental]]s to be mere annoyances, rather than a threat.<ref> And [[darklight]]s sometimes formed strange, symbiotic alliances with scile that craved the colors of [[planewalking]] outsiders.<ref>"
