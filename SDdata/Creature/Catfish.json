        "History": "The dwarven city of [[Iltkazar (city)|Iltkazar]], built during the height of [[Shanatar]], maintained drainage pits in which catfish were raised as a food source.\n\nDuring the height of the [[elf|elven]] empire of [[Cormanthyr]], catfish was considered a feasting food and a delicacy in some circles.\n\nCatfish were eaten in ancient [[Netheril]], and could be purchased from fishmongers at [[Low Netheril|Low Netherese]] markets like those in [[Dalekeva]]. Prior to the creation of the [[Anauroch]] desert, they could be found in Netheril's [[Moray River]].\n\nIn Wa, a magic stream on the [[Fochu Peninsula]] was known as the [[Catfish Stream]]. Anyone who leapt into the stream while holding a [[sack]] filled with a handful of [[blue mahogany]] dust had a chance of a catfish manifesting within the sack. In some cases, a message might be visible on catfish's scales, while in some other cases, the scales might instead be poisonous to the touch.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], poor villagers in places like [[Bogbrook]] in Cormyr and [[Uthmere]] in the [[Great Dale]] caught their own catfish, making it an important source of food. In urban restaurants in the Realms, fresh catfish could be ordered for 5 [[copper piece]]s, meaning it was one of the more affordable fish.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Imaraska]] made use of [[illusory]] flying catfish to scout and patrol for her.{{Cite adventurers league/Wings of Death|22}}"
