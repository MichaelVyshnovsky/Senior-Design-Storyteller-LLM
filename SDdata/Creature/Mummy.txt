Mummies caused fear in the living on sight, and any creature they touched was affected by a rotting curse called mummy rot. The rot, if left uncured, could kill its host within 1-6 months. With each passing month, the victim suffered from the disease, their skin rotted more and more, and the natural healing rate significantly slowed down. This affliction could be alleviate via the cure disease or break enchantment spells, while cure wounds was completely useless. When a creature died from the mummy rot, the disease destroyed the corpse within twelve seconds, leaving extremely little time to return them to life by magical means. A fully rotted corpse could not be resurrected by the raise dead spell. Among other diseases that were carried by various mummified creatures were deadeye, heartsting, deathbite, and palsy.
All mummies spread terror, forcing even the bravest creatures to flee in terror or be paralyzed by the looming dread.
These undead creatures could only be harmed by magical or enchanted weapons, and even these tools were only partially effective. Like many other undead, mummies were immune to spells and effects such as sleep, charm, hold, poison, and paralysis, while cold was completely useless when wielded against them. Fire, both magical and mundane, as well as holy water, posed significant danger to mummies.
A mummy could be returned to life by a cleric with the use of the resurrection spell. However, it depended on the priests abilities and the mummys age. Remove curse did not affect them, while spells such as wish could return mummies to life.
Mummies were the undead guardians of tombs and vaults of honored dead (such as kings or nobility of the ancient world). They patrolled their homes with dedication, remaining alert for signs of tomb robbers or others who would defile their assigned lair. In their state of undead existence, mummies felt hatred to all living things, attacking every creature in their way indiscriminately.
Mummies were granted great physical strength, and their scabrous touch carried a virulent curse that acted as a disease, known as mummy rot. Mummified creatures used their natural weapons with the unnatural undead strength to clobber, pummel, claw, or bite their opponents. However, more exotic mummified creatures retained some of the fearsome abilities they had in life.

Most mummies were not created by magical means and were simply embalmed nobles, heroes, and other important individuals. In some cases, mummification and being turned into undead guardians was reserved for criminals or transgressors who wronged a powerful leader or priest. After being interred, these mummified creatures, were known to spontaneously rise from tombs when their final resting places were disturbed. The forces that aided in the creation of these creatures could be unspeakable dark magics or greed of the interred person in life, unwilling to suffer grave robbers in death. This powerful feeling of greed could tap into the energies of the Positive Energy plane, transforming them into the walking dreadful undead beings.
Due to their connection to the Positive Energy plane, mummies existed simultaneously on both Prime Material and Positive Energy planes.
Like other undead, mummies were not natural creatures, did not need eat nor drink, and had no predators and natural enemies.

Traditional mummy was created via a long and arduous process of mummifying a body. The corpse that was to become a mummy was first soaked in a preservative substance, such as a carbonate of soda. The soaking was done over the course of several weeks. Then the body was covered with aromatics, such as spices and raisins. The bodys hearts, brains, and liver were often removed and preserved in separate canopic jars and stored not far from the mummified body within the tomb. The body was thoroughly preserved wrapped in linen cloth strips that sometimes held gemstones affixed between the sheets. Some mummies, often monstrous mummies linens were dyed and soaked in additional preserving salves and tinctures of herbal nature.
When mummies were created to serve as eternal guards via necromantic magics, the mummy wrappings were inscribed with magical symbols, and the ritual culminated in a dark magic incantation that created the undead creature. The sentry mummy became animated when specific conditions indicated in its creation were met. These conditions typically were trespassing in the mummys tomb, theft, or offenses against the mummys loved ones.
