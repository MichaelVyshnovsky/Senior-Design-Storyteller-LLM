'''Giant maggots''' were the larval stage for several giant insect species.

==Description==
Giant maggots looked like their smaller cousins. Some giant maggots had several appendages growing from their body, causing them to resemble a hideous caterpillar.

==Abilities==
Giant maggots were immune to all mind-affecting effects and spells.

==Combat==
Giant maggots avoided combat, only attacking a creature in self-defense. If a giant maggot was starving, they became predatory and attacked nearby creatures.

==Ecology==
Several giant insect species laid their eggs on or near the decaying corpse of a large creature or a large pile of dung, upon which the giant maggots fed. When they hatched, giant maggots were {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} in length. They continued to grow for several weeks until reaching a maximum length of about {{SI|3|ft|c}}. Shortly after, the giant maggot metamorphosed into an adult giant insect.
