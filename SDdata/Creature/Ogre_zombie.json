If they died, the ogres would reanimate as zombies and continue fighting.\n* Nildar Sunblight kept an ogre zombie as a pet. The Sunblight clan of duergar also owned a second ogre zombie, which they used to pull a dog sled when robbing the people of Caer-Konig in 1489 DR.\nThe casting of summon undead III could conjure ogre zombies to fight for the caster."
