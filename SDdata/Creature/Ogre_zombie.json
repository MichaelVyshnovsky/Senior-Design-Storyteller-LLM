        "mainbody": "Ogre zombies were powerful zombies created from the corpses of ogres.\nLike other zombies these undead fought with their fists, though they were also known to be armed with greatclubs or morningstars.\n* The wizard Amelior Amanitas owned a copper flask that could unleash a pair of fanatically loyal ogre berserkers to fight for him. If they died, the ogres would reanimate as zombies and continue fighting.\n* Nildar Sunblight kept an ogre zombie as a pet. The Sunblight clan of duergar also owned a second ogre zombie, which they used to pull a dog sled when robbing the people of Caer-Konig in 1489 DR.\nThe casting of summon undead III could conjure ogre zombies to fight for the caster."
