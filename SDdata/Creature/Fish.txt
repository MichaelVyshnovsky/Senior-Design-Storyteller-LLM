A '''fish''' was a type of limbless aquatic animal that was often used as a source of food by many creatures.

==Description==
Most types of fish were generally not a threat, but [[giant fish]] could be deadly foes, sometimes swallowing foes whole.

==Ecology==
Fish of the same type often gathered in "schools". They often did not attack others unless [[magic]]ally commanded to do so. They were herded by [[merfolk]], and sometimes guarded by [[nixie]]s.

==Religion==
[[Blibdoolpoolp]], the goddess of the [[kuo-toa]] (who themselves were fish-like humanoids), often took the form of a woman with a fish's head.

Some societies believed that [[kraken]]s were deities—such creatures may have bestowed plentiful harvests of fish upon their worshipers, should the krakens be pleased with their deeds.

==Usages==

Several creatures ate fish as either part of or all of their diet. Some of these creatures included [[bronze dragon|bronze]]

Fish could be summoned by a variety of spells, from ''[[monster summoning I]]'' (which could summon a single [[lamprey]]) to ''[[monster summoning VIII]]'' (which could summon a [[giant shark]]). Rancid fish could be used as a [[material component]] for the spell ''[[lich touch]]''.

The infamous [[beholder]] [[Xanathar]] kept a goldfish named [[Sylgar]] as a pet.
