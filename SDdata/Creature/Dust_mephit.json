        "mainbody": "A dust mephit was a mephit from the Elemental Plane of Air or Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust.\nA dust mephit was about four feet (120 centimeters) tall and weighed a couple pounds (about one kilogram). They had rough gray skin, which seemed to produce dust and grit constantly as they moved. Like all mephits, dust mephits were impish in appearance and had wispy wings.\nDust mephits typically seemed sorrowful and irritable.\nDust mephits could heal themselves as long as they were in a dusty, dry environment. They had the ability to breathe a conical cloud of irritating particulates, which could cause burning eyes and itching skin in victims. They also had the innate power to surround themselves with a blurring cloud of dust about once every hour or to call forth a powerful wall of roiling dust once per day. They were immune to the effects of fire or poisons.\nWhen forced to fight, these mephits were exceptionally persistent and would rarely ever retreat, biting and clawing and injuring opponents with their breath.\nDust mephits preferred living in places that were arid, such as deserts or old, abandoned buildings."
