        "Description": "A dust mephit was about four feet (120 centimeters) tall and weighed a couple pounds (about one kilogram). They had rough gray skin, which seemed to produce dust and grit constantly as they moved. Like all mephits, dust mephits were [[imp]]ish in appearance and had wispy wings.",
        "Personality": "Dust mephits typically seemed sorrowful and irritable.",
        "Abilities": "Dust mephits could heal themselves as long as they were in a dusty, dry environment. They had the ability to breathe a conical cloud of irritating particulates, which could cause burning eyes and itching skin in victims. They also had the innate power to surround themselves with a blurring cloud of dust about once every hour or to call forth a powerful [[wind wall|wall of roiling dust]] once per day. They were immune to the effects of fire or poisons.",
        "Combat": "When forced to fight, these mephits were exceptionally persistent and would rarely ever retreat, biting and clawing and injuring opponents with their breath.",
        "Society": "Dust mephits preferred living in places that were arid, such as deserts or old, abandoned buildings."
