A '''rat''' was a long-tailed rodent, a species of [[animal]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==Behavior==
Rats were generally cowardly creatures, but would become fierce if cornered or trapped. They feared fire, but if hungry enough could be driven to ignore this base instinct.

==Ecology==
[[File:Luskan South Bank - Valerie Valusek.png|thumb|300px|''A rat in the city of [[Luskan]].'']]
[[Thomas C. Quirkilious]] of the [[Chromatic Scale]] instrument shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] experimented with using ratgut to make [[lute]] strings. The experiment was a failure, as it proved difficult to process them into strings and the resulting fiber squeaked when played.

===Habitats===
Rats thrived in urban environments where they could easily feed off the leftover food and waste of the community.

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], rats could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].
