        "Description": "Groundhogs were able to gnaw through wood and trees at a quick rate. They were fairly common.\n\nWoodchucks were somewhat dexterous and were good at hiding, moving silently, and listening. They also had a strong sense of smell.",
        "Ecology": "The little animals were of no threat to [[human]]s. Woodchuck pelts were worth about 1 [[gp]] each.\n\nOn the continent of [[Faer√ªn]], groundhogs were known to dwell in [[Cormanthor]] In the [[Crowded Sea]], sapient groundhogs lived on the island chain known as the [[Steaming Isles]].\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], they could be found on the planet of [[Chandos]]."
