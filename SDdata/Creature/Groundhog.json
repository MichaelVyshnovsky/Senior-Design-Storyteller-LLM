        "mainbody": "A groundhog, often called a woodchuck, was a small mammalian creature.\nGroundhogs were able to gnaw through wood and trees at a quick rate. They were fairly common.\nWoodchucks were somewhat dexterous and were good at hiding, moving silently, and listening. They also had a strong sense of smell.\nThe little animals were of no threat to humans. Woodchuck pelts were worth about 1 gp each.\nOn the continent of Faer√ªn, groundhogs were known to dwell in Cormanthor In the Crowded Sea, sapient groundhogs lived on the island chain known as the Steaming Isles.\nBeyond Toril, they could be found on the planet of Chandos."
