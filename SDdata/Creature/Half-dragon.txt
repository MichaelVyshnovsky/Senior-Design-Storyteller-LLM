A '''half-dragon''' was a cross between a [[dragon]] and another unrelated creature.

==Abilities==
A half-dragon had the ability to use the breath weapon of its dragon half, though it was not as potent and could not be used as frequently. Half-dragons had [[low-light vision]] and [[darkvision]]. They also had tinted skin or scales that were of the same color as their dragon parent and helped protect from physical attacks.

All half-dragons were immune to sleep and paralysis effects. They also had an additional immunity based of which dragon type they were related to.

==Subraces==
Blue half-dragon hobgoblins were the first generation result of mating between the dragons of [[Morueme]] and their [[hobgoblin]] allies.<ref>
