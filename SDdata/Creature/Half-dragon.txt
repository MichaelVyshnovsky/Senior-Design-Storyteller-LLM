A half-dragon was a cross between a dragon and another unrelated creature.
A half-dragon had the ability to use the breath weapon of its dragon half, though it was not as potent and could not be used as frequently. Half-dragons had low-light vision and darkvision. They also had tinted skin or scales that were of the same color as their dragon parent and helped protect from physical attacks.
All half-dragons were immune to sleep and paralysis effects. They also had an additional immunity based of which dragon type they were related to.
Blue half-dragon hobgoblins were the first generation result of mating between the dragons of Morueme and their hobgoblin allies.
