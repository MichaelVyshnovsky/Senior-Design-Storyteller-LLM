A '''Thayan golem''' was a variety of [[golem]] constructed and sold exclusively by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. They were vigilant sentries for those who wanted to enjoy the distinct "golem-enhanced lifestyle".

==Description==
On a superficial level, a Thayan golem represented a [[humanoid]] guardsman standing {{SI|6|ft}} tall. They were formed from polished [[Thayan oak]] but bore no markings that linked them to their native Thay.

One of the golem's forearms was replaced by a built-in [[longbow]]. The golem was quite skilled with the weapon, capable of mimicking the combat feats of skilled archers.

==Abilities==
While Thayan golems lacked the comprehensive spell immunity enjoyed by most other forms of golem, they were completely impervious to ''[[magic missile]]s''. They maintained the usual immunities [[poison]], [[disease]]s, [[energy drain]]s, as well as mind-altering spells and effects.

==History==
The origins of Thayan golems traced back to the first attempts the Red Wizards made to establish one of their [[Thayan enclave|enclaves]] in the [[Dalelands]]. The native Dalesman rebuked the golems as shameful and extravagant due to their cultural appreciation for archery and longbows as weapons.

The Red Wizards then tried a different tact, offering their golems for sale to the neighboring nation of [[Sembia]], as a defense against the brigands of the Dales. Since then, they have garnered the reputation as something of a status symbol among Sembian merchants.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the process for constructing a Thayan golem remained a secret known only to the Red Wizards. The minimum price at which they would sell one of these constructs was about forty thousand [[gold pieces]].
