        "mainbody": "A '''swanmay''' was a [[humanoid]] that could transform into a [[swan]],",
        "Description": "Swanmays were intelligent [[ranger]]s (or [[druid]]s) that could take the form of swans, mostly for mobility purposes. In humanoid form, they resembled beautiful women, often wearing [[light armor]] or attendant garb",
        "Behavior": "These induced lycanthropes kept themselves to their own kind, never divulging about their true nature. They disliked noisy, ferocious, and [[evil]] beings.",
        "Combat": "In swan form, the creature took reduced damage except against cold iron and had higher resistance to [[magic]]al [[spell]]s. In this form, they attacked with flying leaps, buffeting their wings, and biting. In human form, they fought in light [[armor]], and attacked with [[sword]]s and [[dagger]]s at close range, and [[bow]]s at long range.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Swanmays rarely traveled outside a specific area, as they preferred living in sororities near rivers, lakes, and forests teeming with wildlife. There were legends of the Seven Swanmays who lived in the [[King's Forest]], granting good fortune to those who revered and protected life and nature of the woods, and bringing misfortune on those who endangered the forest with fires and poaches.\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], swanmays could be found in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].<ref>",
            "Relationships": "Swanmays got on well with like-minded forest dwellers, such as [[dryad]]s and and [[wood elves]]."

        "History": "[[File:Swanmay 2e.jpg|thumb|''A swanmay in her humanoid shape.'']]\nThe first swanmay was a [[human]] ranger named [[Fionnghuala]]. Fionnghuala gave her life defending King [[Oberon]] of the [[Seelie Court]] from the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]]. In reward for her selfless bravery and sacrifice, Oberon raised her from the dead and made her a demigod, while his wife [[Titania]] offered her the magic white feather that transformed her into a part-fey being and made her into a swanmay.",
