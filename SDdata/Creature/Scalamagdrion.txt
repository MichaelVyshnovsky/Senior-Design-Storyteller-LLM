'''Scalamagdrions''', also known as '''Guardians of the Tome''', were powerful, [[dragon]]-like creatures that had innate [[magic]]-dampening powers. They were known for being used as protectors, who watched over [[arcane]] [[book|tome]]s and [[spellbook]]s.

==Description==
They were large creatures, around 12 feet (3.7 meters) in length and had silver or gray scales. The wings of scalamagdrions were rather diminutive for their size. Their prehensile tails had a number of spiky protrusions.

In a superficial sense, they resembled young [[silver dragon]]s.

==Behavior==
Scalamagdrions were stalwart defenders and could be tasked with defending a single tome of arcane knowledge or power. They did so with aggressive fervor.

==Powers==
As a species, scalamagdrions possessed powerful ''[[antimagic]]'' powers and properties. They were capable of continuously ''[[spell turning|turning any spells]]'' directed upon them and could ''silence'' anyone around them, as per [[silence|the arcane spell]].

==Combat==
Scalamagdrions were aggressive combatants and attacked at first sight when designated as protector over a book. If they were challenged by a group, they were shrewd enough to know their arcane protections would thwart most [[spellcaster]]s and immediately went after any warriors or martial-oriented foes at first.

==Ecology==
While they were solitary creatures, scalamagdrions were believed to lair in a vast network of tunnels and caves, or perhaps even some extra-dimensional realm. It was believed by some that these were located somewhere beneath the [[Great Glacier]].

==History==
One page within the spellbook known as ''[[the Scalamagdrion]]'' contained a picture of the creature. If any prohibited individual attempted to read the book, a ''[[portal]]'' to the scalamagdrion's domain was opened up and one appeared before the reader.
