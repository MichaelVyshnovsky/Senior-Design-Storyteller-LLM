A mosasaurus () was a species of ichthyosaur.
Mosasaurs were massive marine creatures. They had large flippers that were strong enough to allow them to "walk" on land. They had sharp teeth and a very strong jaw.
Mosasaurs hunted on nearly all marine creatures within their territory. Their jaw was so strong it could crush bones and shells with ease.
Mosasaurs were carnivorous and solitary creatures. They were air breathers.
