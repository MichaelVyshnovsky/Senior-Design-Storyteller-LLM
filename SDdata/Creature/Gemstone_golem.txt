'''Gemstone golems''', also called '''gem golems''', were beautiful but deadly automatons created from various precious [[gem]]s. The three most common forms of gemstone [[golem]] included those made from [[rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and [[diamond]]s.
{{Quote|''We have discovered that [[Aznar Thrul|Zulkir Thrul]]'s gemstone golems do indeed exist, and they are highly resistant to the magic of [[Rashemen]]. Even if we manage to defeat the [[Thay]]ans, it may be at such a terrible cost that we will be helpless against their next attack.''|[[Nythra|Nythra of the Seven Rivers]], a [[Wychlaran|witch of Rashemen]]}}

==Description==
Owing to having the appearance of being carved from glittering precious stone, the average gemstone golem had a decidedly more delicate and agile look than the average golem. This was deceiving, however, as a gemstone golem could easily weight up to {{SI|3000|pounds|k|long=yes}}.

Each type of gemstone golem was said to embody the power of that specific stone's [[gem magic]], a lost and imprecise form of [[the Art]]:
* '''[[Ruby golem]]s''' were said to embody healing and the powers of [[Earth (element)|earth]]
* '''[[Emerald golem]]s''' were said to embody teleportation magic and were able to open ''[[gate]]s''
* '''[[Diamond golem]]s''' were said to embody perfection
However, just as gemstones may be flawed, so too were gemstone golems, and these flaws led them to diverge from the intentions of their creators and the powers which they were intended to embody.

==Behavior==
As a general rule, gemstone golems were not as accurate in following commands as other golems, and could be hard to control. In order to control a gemstone golem during battle, a circle of at least a dozen [[wizard]]s, led by a superior, was needed. Directing the golem required the circle's complete focus, and any interruption resulted in the golem wandering aimlessly. The control extended for {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} beyond where the circle was first formed. Gemstone golems were deactivated when not in use by a circle.

Gemstone golems could understand verbal commands and language, but could not speak.

==Combat==
Regardless of the type of gemstone used during construction, these golems were highly resistant to physical damage and were practically unstoppable when unleashed.

==Society==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], gemstone golems were controlled almost exclusively by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], although many had since gone somewhat rogue, wandering the lands to fulfill partial or garbled versions of ancient commands. And it was not uncommon to find them in [[Mulhorand]]'s [[Land of the Dead]], acting as guardians of the various [[pharaoh]]s' tombs.<ref>

Creation of a gemstone golem did not require that the entire body be carved out of a certain precious stone, as was a widely believed myth. Instead, the golem could be cobbled together from many [[semi-precious stones]], however the golem's "heart" did need to be a large and valuable specimen of [[ruby]], [[emerald]], or [[diamond]]. This heart became the [[magic]]al locus of the golem's construction, and could cause the other component materials to meld into a facsimile of the same gemstone. If the creation process failed, the heart would be lost but other materials could be reclaimed to try again.

A gemstone golem would collapse into a pile of rough cut precious gems and powder when slain. The gems were quite valuable and the powder could be used by wizards for [[spell component]]s.

==History==
The first recorded creation of a gemstone golem was by the god-kings of [[Mulhorand]]. The secrets to their construction was lost for centuries, until in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, when the [[Red Wizard]] [[Zulkir]] [[Aznar Thrul]] discovered the ancient Mulhorand manuals that detailed the process of their creation. He went about unleashing them upon the [[Rashemaar]], agianst whom they proved highly effective as they were largely resistant to the [[Wychlaran]]'s spells as well as [[Rashemen]]'s natural magics.

Thrul also experimented with creating golems from gemstones other than diamonds, emeralds, or rubies but the results were always mixed.

After a few successful raids which left no survirors among the Rashemaar, Thrul prepared for a major assault. The gemstone golems clashed with the Rashemaar in the [[Battle of the Gorge]] at the [[Gorge of Gauros]]. As the golems crashed through enemy lines, their command circle, led by Zulkir Nevron himself, was broken (although it was unclear whether this was because of efforts by the adventurers or thanks to Tam loyalists within the circle), and the entire gemstone golem army was freed of their control.

Soon after, Thrul found that we was not able to control his remaining army of gemstone golems either, and they too broke away, scattering across [[Faer√ªn]] via the ''[[gate|gating]]'' abilities of the emerald golems. By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, they wandered the land as semi-independent constructs, many still following faint echoes of their last commands.
