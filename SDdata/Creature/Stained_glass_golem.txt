A '''stained glass golem''' was a type of [[golem]] resembling stained glass. They were constructed to blend in with the decor of a temple or palace, in order to hide them from view to all except unwanted visitors.

==Description==
They resembled flat, two-dimensional imitations of people made from glass. They were silent and never communicated; the only sound they made was a tinkling sound like delicate crystal wind chimes when they moved. As they moved, they flickered and twinkled as the light passing through them refracted.

==Abilities==
Like many golems, glass golems possessed a general immunity to most [[magic]] and [[spell]]s. and the [[spell]] ''[[shatter]]'',

A stained glass golem could be repaired with ''[[mending]]'', but healed rapidly on its own.

==Combat==
They fought by swinging their arms; like broken glass, their edges were very sharp.

==Society==
They were typically encountered alone, in pairs, or in groups of up to five.
===Construction===
To create a stained glass golem, a high-level [[arcane]] spellcaster skilled in glass-making required some {{SI|50|lb|k|long=yes}} of glass shards and the spells ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', and ''[[polymorph any object]]'', and it otherwise cost 10,000 [[gold piece]]s.
===Usages===
Deep within the jungles of [[Chult]], four of these golems were installed by the [[necromancer]] [[Zzarka Tuzarr]] within the stained glass windows of her sandstone pyramid [[Temple of Zzarka|stronghold]].<ref>{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Strongholds of Undeath Portals}}

Within the quiet village of [[Irl]], many of the larger and wealthier families had a number of stained glass golems at their command.<ref>
