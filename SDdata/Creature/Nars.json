        "mainbody": "he Nars was a breed of heavy horse commonly found throughout the lands of northern and northeast Faerûn. It was popular among both the nobility and common-folk of Impiltur, Rashemen as well as the Cold Lands and was a principle specimen among the horse markets of Nathoud.\nRather strong and large of frame, the Nars was capable of pulling a sled or carriage that otherwise required two horses. Despite its imposing size, it had a surprisingly quick gait.\nThe Nars had a good disposition and was not easily spooked or startled."
