        "mainbody": "'''Lions''' were powerful feline predators that travelled and hunted in large groups, known as prides.",
        "Description": "Male lions had large manes of golden fur. They were responsible for defending the pride against any attackers. Female lions, who had no manes, were the hunters of the pride. They used group tactics to hunt and provide food for the entire pride.. A male lion was {{SIrange|5|8|ft}} in length and weighed {{SIrange|330|550|lb|k}}. Females were slightly smaller.",
        "Biology": "Lions lived in prides of up twenty individuals, mostly females and their cubs. Each pride only had up to three adult male lions. Lions were obligate carnivores and hunted large animals such as [[giraffe]]s and [[zebra]]s. If necessary, they will hunt domesticated animals. They rarely hunted [[humanoid]]s. The gestation period of a lion cub was approximately three months.",
        "Combat": "Lions were powerful and dangerous predators. Female lions hunted prey in packs, co-operating to drive their prey into a location ideal for ambush. Their long and sharp claws delivered devastating damage.",
        "Abilities": "Their powerful hindquarters allowed a lion to jump up to {{SI|30|ft}}. Their sense were very sensitive and as a result, it was very difficult to sneak up on a lion. Lions avoided climbing and swimming.",
        "Species": {
            "Spotted Lion": "Spotted lions were about thirty percent larger than the standard lion, and had a speckled outer coat. They roamed the plains and hills of the land, and exhibited similar form and behavior as other lions. [[Fracto-Nimbuli]], a [[cloud giant]] in [[Chondath]], kept three spotted lions as pets."

        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "[[File:Fem lion nwn.jpg|thumb|''A female lion from [[Neverwinter Nights]].'']]\nAmong other places, wild lion prides were found in the wild grasslands surrounding the ancient city of [[Cursrah]] in the area that would later become the [[Calim Desert]]. Lions were frequently found near the [[Well of the Cloven Rock]], an oasis within [[Anauroch]], when not hunting in the [[Hills of Scent]]. Other locations there were known to inhabit were the [[Vilhon Reach]]{{Cite dragon/282/The New Adventures of Volo: The Urge to Hunt|72}}",
            "In Cultures": "The [[Golden lion (coin)|golden lion]] served as the currency of [[Cormyr]]. \n\nIn [[Tethyr]], the [[Lion's Sword]] was the Tethyrian sword of state, wielded by princes and kings of the kingdom for centuries. In addition, the [[Monarch's Scepter]], a unique ''[[rod of absorption]]'' that served as part of the regalia of the monarch of Tethyr, was a rod of pure [[silver]], whose forward-oriented end was shaped to look like the head of a roaring lion.\n\n[[Barachiel]], a member of the [[Celestial Hebdomad]] and ruler of [[Lunia]], used a lion as his symbol.\n\n[[Nobanion]] was considered the deity of lions.

Lions were among the favored animals of [[Anhur]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10}}\n\n[[Waukeen]] was often pictured with a pair of golden lions reclining at her feet. One of a set of matching lion statues was recovered from an abandoned temple to the Merchant's Friend in [[Tantras]] and taken to the [[Temple of Torm's Coming]] by [[Dunn Tenwealth]] during the [[Time of Troubles]]; it was this statue which [[Torm]] brought to life to prove himself to [[Adon]], and which he later joined with his human avatar to become the giant, lion-headed man who fought and slew [[Bane]] in Tantras Harbor.\n\n[[Chalsembyr's Heart]], the sword which followers of [[Torm]] created to seek out the deity's lost kingdom from when he was a mortal, had cross guards shaped like lion's paws, and where they met the blade at the rain guard was an image of a lion's head, in profile on one side, face-on on the other.",
            "Usage": "''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold lion hides for 24 [[gp]] a piece.\n\nLions were raised from birth and trained to be companions and mounts in [[Turmish]], even though this task was dangerous, laborious, time-consuming, and could cost a fortune."
