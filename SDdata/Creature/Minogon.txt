'''Minogons''' were a type of [[golem]] that resembled muscular [[minotaur]]s forged out of ''[[wizard's steel]]''.

==Description==
Minogons were as large as regular golems but unlike them, these horned constructs were not maladroit and very fast, although not smarter than an [[iron golem]], nor their [[clay golem|clay]] kin. Adventurers who were unlucky enough to encounter minogons always noted that these creatures fought with passion and anger, a trait unseen among regular constructs.

Their flaming clockwork engines were filled with elemental fire and rage. Their eyes glowed like coals. The smoke could be seen pouring out of their nostrils and their mouth roared with heavy mechanical screech.

==Abilities==
Like many other constructs, minogons were immune to critical strikes, mind-affecting magic and abilities, abilities that drained life-force and experience, [[death magic]], [[disease]]s, paralysis, [[poison]], critical hits, and were impossible to sneak up on.

Minogons were also immune to most types of magic, except for spells that dealt cold damage, and fire spells. Cold-based magical effects successfully negated their ''rage'' and prevented them from ''raging'' from 6 to 60 seconds. Fire magic was beneficial to them, healing minogons on a 1-to-3 ratio, and ''[[haste|hasting]]'' the construct for 6 to 36 seconds.

==Combat==
In combat, minogons could produce savage cries that could leave their opponents stunned three times a day.

They always blindly charged into combat relentlessly cleaving away with their heavy oversized two-handed [[sword]]s or [[axe]]s. These constructs could, and in fact always did, use their [[barbarian]]-like ability to ''[[rage]]'', using their stalling roars in between.

A minogon's initial charge was similar to that of a [[bull]], as the clockwork creature lowered its head and aimed to gore its opponent with its vicious sharp horns. Upon a successful hit, minogon would rend an opponent who ended up stabbed by the horns.

==Ecology==

Minogons, like many similar constructs, were created via binding a spirit to a crafted body. In the case of these minotaur-like creations, spirits used for minogons needed to be agitated and raging. The two spirits used were a [[fire elemental]] and the soul of a dead minotaur warrior. These spirits were summoned and bound to the minogon's flaming clockwork heart.

The bodies were created out of {{SI|4000|lb|k|long=yes}} of [[iron]] or more expensive ''[[wizard's steel]]''. The typical price for one minogon's creation was 62,000 [[gp]], 1,200 gp pf which was the materials for the body. The creature's heart furnace needed five minotaur hearts enclosed inside. The final part of creation involved the following ''[[arcane]]'' spells: ''[[geas]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', and ''[[summon monster IV]]''.
