The Raurin was an ancient breed of light warhorse from the lands of the Raurin desert in southeast Faerûn. It was a strong horse of unequal speed that survived the barren transformation of its native lands.
These horses were a tough and sturdy breed, that possessed heroic endurance, brawn and swiftness. They had long slender legs, with a coat that was typically golden, umber or gray in color.
Raurin horses were exceptional survivalists that could sustain themselves on mere fodder, and could abstain from water for up to three days.
While they were famous and highly-prized in the realms surrounding their homelands, they were virtually unknown and unrecognizable throughout the rest of Faerûn.
The raurin first roamed the lands north of the Dustwall Mountains before it was desert, and was still verdant grasslands. They were bred with many other lines of horses, forming stocks that were found in nearby lands such as Mulhorand, Murghôm and Semphar.
