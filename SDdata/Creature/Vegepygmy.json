        "Description": "Vegepygmies stood between {{SIrange|2|4.5|ft|long=yes}} tall with muscular frames covered in plant matter skin. Their coloration depended on their environment, ranging from brown and green skin in wooded areas, gray and black skin underground, or sometimes a moldy blue and white. Their eyes were normally white, lidless, and did not appear to have pupils, and naturally grew a dull brown topknot. They had heavy wrinkles and lacked noses. Lengthy lines of tendrils, similar to hair cover the creatures, ending in a topknot at their head and flowing regardless of the presence of wind. Their hands end in thorn-like claws.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Combat": "Vegepygmy hunters employed primitive clubs and spears, with any other technology being acquired from other races, or copied directly. The extent of their tactical ability lay in ambushes and maneuvering enemies towards thornies.<ref name=EotVP-p1/>"
        },
        "Society": {
            "Culture": "Vegepygmies were organized into simple tribal units, led by their elders, whom outsiders referred to as \"chiefs\". They were highly tribal and territorial and were generally of low intellect. Mold-folk culture centered around the harvesting of food and the spread of the tribe, even at the cost of their individual lives. Veneration was offered to those who propagated the race, whilst those who refused to grow the tribe were treated as pariahs.<ref name=EotVP-p1/>\n\nCulture also varied based on location. Forest vegepygmies were more aggressive and predominately hunters, while underground vegepygmies were vegetarians, preferring to scavenge, and more likely to ally with other plant-based races. Due to a reliance on different resources, vegepygmies of different tribes were less likely to fight.<ref name=EotVP-p1/>",
            "Relations": "Vegepygmy had generally positive relations with other fungal or plant creatures possessing an instinctive feeling of kinship with them. [[Myconid]]s viewed them as rustic and less enlightened kin and would ally with them, if warily. Vegepygmies would employ [[shrieker]]s and [[violet fungus|violet fungi]] in their lairs as living alarms and security, with only native mold men knowing how to avoid them. Vegepygmy had tense relations with other races, many of which viewed them as monsters. They were known to establish neutral zones in order to engage in mutual unimpeded worship.<ref name=EotVP-p1/>",
            "Language": "Vegepygmies were likely once capable of a spoken language, as some with ancestral memories were capable of speech, and metals bearing carved inscriptions were found within their treasure pits. Lacking this, the [[vegepygmy language]] consisted of hissing, grunting, chest thumps, gestures, and rhythmic taps.<ref name=EotVP-p1/>",
            "Religion and Magic": "Vegepygmies held strong reverence for ancient relics and sacred objects. Many were of unknown composition and origin, and a few of which were powerful weapons.<ref name=EotVP-p1/> They would also worship constructs such as [[golem]]s as lesser deities, giving them offerings. Other tribes might engage in the ritual sacrifice of sapient beings. Ritual dances were also done, with some even killing themselves by accident in reckless performances.\n\nSome vegepygmies were born with supernatural abilities based on their ancestral memories. These vegepygmies became witch doctors capable of [[druid]]ic and [[shaman]]istic magic, such as the ability to empower plant monsters and to rapidly grow nearby plants for offensive purposes. They also could inherit cultural knowledge and the ability to vocally communicate."

        "Ecology": {
            "Physiology": "Vegepygmies were omnivorous, capable of eating meat and blood regardless of its state of decay. They would grow moss and fungi to subsist on, and in particularly hard times, they could absorb nutrients from the soil itself and from almost all organic matter, including as bone. Despite the ability to vocalize through hissing, they lacked the ability to properly speak, although a highly rare few were born with the ancestral ability to do so.<ref name=EotVP-p1/>\n\n{{Fq\n| width  = 300px\n| source = Records of [[Geoff]]<ref name=EotVP-p1/>\n| text   = Five brave heroes went forth to examine the disturbance that had spawned so many fell beasts.

        },
        "History": "The origin of vegepygmies was ultimately unknown. It was speculated that vegepygmies originated outside of [[Toril]], and were brought there by a [[meteor|falling star]] infested with russet mold. Other reports noted their presence in a mountain dungeon containing a strange metal substance.\n\nNumerous vegepygmy tribes were known to dwell in the [[Chult]]an wilderness in the late 1480s [[DR]].",
        "Notable Vegepygmies": "* [[Kupalu√©]], the companion of the [[druid]] [[Qawasha]] as they worked together as guides to visitors of Chult."
