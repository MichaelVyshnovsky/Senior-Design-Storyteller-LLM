        "Description": "Desert dwarves appeared much like other dwarves, except for darker skin.",
        "Geography": "Desert dwarves inhabited the [[House of Tezca]] desert in southern [[Maztica]].",
        "Society": "Desert dwarves lived in small clans of a few hundred members each. They excavated caves in the sides of canyons in order to build their villages. Unlike other dwarves, the lack of iron ore meant that they used stone tools and weapons.",
        "History": "During the [[Rockfire Cataclysm]] of [[987 DR]], [[Underdark]] passages between Maztica and [[Faer√ªn]] were destroyed, stranding a group of dwarves.<ref> After a long journey west, they emerged in the deserts of Maztica."
