She was also said to have slain [[Purple Dragons]] who tried to make a base near her home, as well as others setting up establishments.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a werewyvern by the name of [[Ekim Cyre]], along with a [[green dragon]], protected the [[Bhaalspawn]], [[Abazigal]], from invaders.",
