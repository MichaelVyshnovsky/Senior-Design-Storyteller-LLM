The '''mosquito''' was a type of bloodsucking flying insect.

==Ecology==
Mosquitoes enjoyed warm and humid environments, especially marshes and areas where water tended to form puddles, which they used as breeding areas.

Large populations of mosquitoes were found in the [[rimwood]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]] were also common throughout [[Chult]], especially in humid areas.<ref>

These insects carried several diseases, and [[mosquito fever]] in [[Halruaa]].

===Habitats===
Mosquitos were a blight on the nation of [[Payit]]. Swarms of mosquitoes were known to be thick enough to completely obscure one's vision, making it a challenge to traverse the Payitlan jungles as well as [[Far Payit]]'s depths.
