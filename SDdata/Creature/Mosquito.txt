Large populations of mosquitoes were found in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor were also common throughout Chult, especially in humid areas.
These insects carried several diseases, and mosquito fever in Halruaa.
Mosquitos were a blight on the nation of Payit. Swarms of mosquitoes were known to be thick enough to completely obscure ones vision, making it a challenge to traverse the Payitlan jungles as well as Far Payits depths.
