'''Devil dogs''' were a rare species of arctic canine.

==Description==
These canines had stark-white fur, blue eyes, and on average grew to be {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder. When not within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of them, their white fur made it difficult to perceive a devil dog in areas covered by frost or snow.

==Behavior==
Devil dogs had an average level of intelligence.

==Biology==
Devil dogs were capable of running at very fast speeds and could emit intense barks that triggered an effect similar to ''[[fear]]'' in their enemies.

==Combat==
These canines regularly resorted to lunging for the throats of their enemies.

==History==
In the month of [[Uktar]], [[1358 DR]], the cities of [[Silverymoon]] and [[Sundabar]] had to fend off attacks from huge packs of devil dogs in addition to packs of [[winter wolves]] and bands of [[frost giant]]s.

==Ecology==
Devil dogs traveled in packs.

===Diet===
Devils dogs were a carnivorous species. They were especially known to attack groups of [[human]]s.

===Habitats===
These creatures were only known to inhabit regions with cold climates.
