Tar devils were low-ranked soldiers of the Nine Hells, so-called for the dangerous tar-like substance exuded from their bodies.
Tar devils resembled humanoids with two short, upwards-curving horns protruding from their heads, haunting, pupilless eyes, beast-like feet, and powerful, non-prehensile, lizard-like tails. Their skin constantly oozed a sludge that dribbled down and left a tacky trail wherever they went.
Tar devils were known to entertain themselves by burning creatures, such as small animals.
Tar devils were resistant to fire, but vulnerable to acid. Their titular feature, their tar, could be utilized in many ways, but was generally inhibited movement and made their opponents easier to burn.
In general, tar devils typically wore minimal armor.
Tar devils trained as guards reeked from the hot tar of their bodies, which burned anyone who drew close, and fought with their khopeshes and tar-covered nets.
Tar devil harriers meanwhile used kukri and flung balls of tar to slow opponents or unleashed a fuming cloud that impeded vision and movement.
Tar devil brawlers utterly coated their environments with their tar coating, splattering it around themselves everywhere they went. Their fist strikes typically left their enemies unable to escape.

In the late years of the 15 century DR, the Ashmadai cells of Neverwinter were known to employ the services of tar devils.
