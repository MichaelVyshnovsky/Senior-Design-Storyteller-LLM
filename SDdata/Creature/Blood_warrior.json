        "mainbody": "'''Blood warriors''' were previously living [[human]] [[fighter]]s transformed into powerful [[undead]] [[warrior]]s through the dark [[magic]] of [[Kazgaroth]].",
        "Description": "Blood warriors were similar in appearance to decaying [[zombie]]s, but with burning red eyes and armed with [[weapon]]s.",
        "Personality": "They were extremely bloodthirsty, were absolutely loyal to Kazgaroth, and had unwavering morale.",
        "Combat": "Much like [[vampire]]s, blood warriors had to kill to preserve their unholy vitality. For each week that went by without taking a life, the warriors lost more of their essence until they died or regained it through slaughter. They also had the ability to fight under the benefit of a ''[[haste]]'' spell. In order to receive this power, the blood warrior leader had to perform a dark ritual involving [[human]] or [[demihuman]] sacrifice and then bless his soldiers with the spilled blood of the victim.\n\nAs undead creatures, the blood warriors were immune to the aging brought on by the ''haste''.",
        "Society": "A unit of blood warriors consisted of 50â€“500 soldiers under a leader and all of them under Kazgaroth's control. Kazgaroth could form one of these units every time he came out of hibernation to spread terror and destruction throughout [[Moonshae]].",
        "Notable Blood Warriors": "* [[Laric]], the captain of the [[Bloodriders]]."
