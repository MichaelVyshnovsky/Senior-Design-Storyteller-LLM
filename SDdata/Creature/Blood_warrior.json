        "mainbody": "lood warriors were previously living human fighters transformed into powerful undead warriors through the dark magic of Kazgaroth.\nBlood warriors were similar in appearance to decaying zombies, but with burning red eyes and armed with weapons.\nThey were extremely bloodthirsty, were absolutely loyal to Kazgaroth, and had unwavering morale.\nMuch like vampires, blood warriors had to kill to preserve their unholy vitality. For each week that went by without taking a life, the warriors lost more of their essence until they died or regained it through slaughter. They also had the ability to fight under the benefit of a haste spell. In order to receive this power, the blood warrior leader had to perform a dark ritual involving human or demihuman sacrifice and then bless his soldiers with the spilled blood of the victim.\nAs undead creatures, the blood warriors were immune to the aging brought on by the haste.\nA unit of blood warriors consisted of 50â€“500 soldiers under a leader and all of them under Kazgaroths control. Kazgaroth could form one of these units every time he came out of hibernation to spread terror and destruction throughout Moonshae.\n* Laric, the captain of the Bloodriders."
