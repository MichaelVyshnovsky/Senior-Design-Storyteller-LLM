        "mainbody": "Kholiathra () were unseen protectors of the elven lands and servants of Sehanine Moonbow.\nThese spirits resembled transparent humanoids with only their blurry, glassy, wispy outlines visible.\nTheir movements were completely silent, and they glided through the air or moved along the ground. Kholiathra could easily avoid detection by, at will, becoming completely invisible.\nKholiathra were surrounded by a  field of good or ill luck. Benevolent individuals within the field were supremely lucky in mundane tasks and if there was a raging battle.\nThe invisible creatures liked elven people some sages even went as far as to theorize kholiathra were spirits of dead elves themselves. Kholiathra enjoyed their co-existence and willingly granted the boon of good luck to the tel-quessir. When kholiathra gathered in groups, they showed their carefree nature, frolicking and flying bout on and above sunlight-drowned heathers on days of clear skies. Those who were lucky enough to witness the revelry were sure to remember the beautiful sight.\nthumb|A lone kholiathra.|374x374px\nKholiathra were non-confrontational creatures who fled battle while being invisible. In rare cases when they were forced into a fight, kholiathra violently pummeled their opponents with crushing invisible force.\nThese spirits lived in small groups, around forests and other places inhabited by the tel-quessir. Kholiathra were defenders of Evermeet and could be found virtually anywhere on the island. While unseen, kholiathra kept elves safe, stopped minor accidents from happening, turned around unwanted ships that sailed too close to Evermeet, and more importantly, ensured happiness and luck on the island. Most elven inhabitants of Evermeet were unaware of kholiathra.\nOutside of the Prime Material plane, kholiathra resided in the plane of Olympus, serving Sehanine Moonbow, and other gods of the Seldarine â€“ Hanali Celanil, Labelas Enoreth, Solonor Thelandira, Erevan Ilesere, Corellon Larethian, Aerdrie Faenya, and Rillifane Rallathil. The elven gods often sent their kholiathra servants to grant good fortune in wars and childbirth.\nKholiathra were creatures of magical nature and needed to food, drink, nor required sleep. They were believed to get nourishment from sunlight, possibly due to the fact that they often gathered in large groups on sun-lit meadows."
