        "mainbody": "A worg was a type of magical beast that resembled a normal wolf but was larger, more intelligent, and had a fiendish countenance.\nA worg resembled a typical wolf, though much larger and bearing an intelligent, wicked gleam in its eyes. They had gray or black fur, and on average stood  high and were . They weighed around .\nOne known grouping of worgs, presumably in the Western Heartlands, was the Nordiland worgata family. They were known for having particularly glossy coats.\nDespite their higher intelligence and evil traits, worgs tended to act, for the most part, like regular wolves. They often hunted in packs, but were sometimes solitary creatures. Lone worgs tended to hunt smaller animals, while mated pairs and packs hunted larger game. They preferred large, herbivorous animals, usually the young, sick, or weak, but werent afraid to take humanoids, especially when other food sources were exhausted.\nIn any number, worgs employed similar tactics. They would stalk humanoid prey for a number of hours or even days, choosing the best of time of day and terrain for the attack. When they did, they employed hit-and-run tactics to exhaust a victim, until finally the whole pack went in for the kill. If they outnumbered a victim or were especially impatient, they might try to corner the prey, then attack.\nThey attacked with their teeth. Like a wolf, they could bite their prey and try to bear them down to the ground. They also had the benefit of stealth, keen senses, and the ability to scent prey.\nTheir horrific growl was known to instill terror in their prey.\nUnlike most animalistic creatures, worgs could speak. They could speak both Common and Goblinoid, as well as a language of their own.\nWorgs of Faerûn venerated Malar under the named of \"The Great One.\" After worgs death, the Great One led its soul into the unending Great Hunt – worgs afterlife. In the Great Hunt worgs were given the blessing of the bloodlust as they gored and mutilated their former masters and hunted other prey.\nWorgs were sometimes enslaved by orcs, goblins, and other such creatures to act as mounts or attack dogs. And sometimes they were specifically being bred for these purposes. They were also used as mounts by some bands of hobgoblins.\nWorgs were known to act as servants of the deity Garagos.\nWorg fangs were valuable alchemical commodity. When calcinated they were reduced to ashes of worg fangs, which, in turn, was mixed with certain types of salts to make elixirs of bloodlust."
