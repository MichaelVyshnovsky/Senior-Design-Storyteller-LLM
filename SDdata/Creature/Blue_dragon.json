        "mainbody": "Blue dragons, referred to by sages as draco electricus> were a breed of chromatic true dragon. Their breath weapon was a line of lightning or a large electrical discharge.\nthumb|left|190px|A review of blue dragon anatomy.\nBlue dragons were physically distinguished by the single large horn protruding from their heads and also by their ears, which were rather large and frilled. The neck was short and broad. The tail was thick and flat. They smelled like electricity or sand.\nA dragon egg could be identified as belonging to a blue by the web of thin blue lines seen when held in front of an intense white light.\nThey were orderly creatures and were unusual for chromatic dragons in that they maintained fairly well-ordered, hierarchical societies.\nThey were also extremely adept at burrowing in sand, and often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they were so burrowed, their large horns could easily be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.\nBlue dragons used a shocking burst of lightning.\nBlue dragons were native to arid wastelands and deserts. They made their lairs in underground caves easily accessible to the dragons, as they could burrow through the ground. These dragons would fly above their territory, using the bleak landscape and its sparse terrain features as their best chance of spotting opponents.\nthumb|right|200px|A blue dragon wyrmling.\nDespite their evil nature, blue dragons were actually excellent parents to their young, and would rarely leave their eggs unattended.\n* Abazigal, a Bhaalspawn dragon or half-dragon that was a member of \"The Five\" during the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR.\n* Alasklerbanbastos, also known as \"The Great Bone Wyrm\", a dracolich ruling Threskel\n* Anaxaster and Chezzaran, offspring of Iymrith, living in Ascore\n* Araugauthos, also known as \"The Bluetalon\", imprisoned in the ruins of Undermountain\n* Arharzel, the offspring of Roraurim and Faenphaele\n* Clytemorrenestrix, also known as \"Nestrix\" and \"The Terror of the Calim\" who was turned into a human during the Spellplague\n* Eshaedra, the mate of Nahaunglaroth.\n* Faenphaele, Roraurims mate.\n* Gloriankithsanus\n* Idrizraele, Kizilpazars mate.\n* Iryklathagra, also known as \"Sharpfangs\" who plagued the Lands of Intrigue.\n* Iymrith, also known as \"The Doom of the Desert\" in Anauroch.\n* Kizilpazar, patriarch of the Morueme clan, from  to .\n* Krashos Morueme, who professed to be \"Quevven Jusztiirn\", a venerable drow mage.\n* Lennithon, an participant in the raid on Greenest and associate of the Cult of the Dragon in the 1480s DR.\n* Maldraedior\n* Nahaunglaroth, co-leader of the Blood of Morueme since .\n* Nystalancer, transformed into a human by the archmage Arcturia in the Arcturiadoom level of Undermountain.\n* Olothontor, also known as \"The Minstrel Wyrm\", whose lair was not far from Waterdeep.\n* Roraurim, co-leader of the Blood of Morueme since \n* Saluuknir, also known as \"The Blue Vishap\", trapped within the Urn of the Blue Vishap\n* Sapphiraktar the Blue, an ancient male blue dracolich.\n* Venasorrn, transformed into a human by the archmage Arcturia in the Arcturiadoom level of Undermountain.\n* Anwir Dupretiskava, an ancient blue dragon and the disguised head of state of Var the Golden."
