Common raggamoffyns were a variation of raggamoffyn composed of leather cloaks, gloves, and bits of armor. As their name suggested, they were the most common form of raggamoffyn encounted in Undermountain and Waterdeep.
All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victims face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyns bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creatures control.
Common raggamoffyns usually attempted to control human-sized targets. Targets who temporatily escaped their control risked being asphyxiated.
These creatures were usually encountered in alleys, rubbish heaps, and the City of the Dead. They often gathered in packs of controlled thieves, watchmen, and others who were active at night.
