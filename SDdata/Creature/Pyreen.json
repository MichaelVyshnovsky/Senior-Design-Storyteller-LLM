        "mainbody": "Pyreens, also known as peace-bringers, were an ancient and mysterious humanoid race of powerful druids and psionicists native to the desert world of Athas, whose existence was known by very few.\nPyreen exhibited physical characteristics of all the major humanoid and demihuman races of Athas. This including having broad bodies like Athasian dwarves, pointed ears reminiscent of Athasian elves, eyes like that of a human or Athasian giant, and facial features reminiscent of Athasian halflings. A pyreen were rarely ever seen in this natural form, as they preferred to travel around shapechanged into the form of an animal or one of the many humanoid or demihuman races of Athas.\nThe pyreens were an incredibly intelligent race with vast knowledge of how Athas was before it became a desert world, but they would not reveal this knowledge to the unworthy, even if it cost them their lives. They had a distaste for combat, but would engage in it when necessary. They were likely to aid druids defending the land, those fighting defilers or who had fought defilers in the past, but would otherwise callously not intervene in those fighting dangerous creatures. This callousness was due to their long lifespans and dedication to nature, viewing the comparatively shorter lived races as generally not worth them risking their own lives and by extension their mission.\nWhenever a pyreen helped or intervened on behalf of others they did so either from afar or in a shapechanged form. They were quite careful about not revealing how powerful they were to others, moderating their psionics or druidic magic in order to give off the illusion that they were less powerful.\nPyreens possessed an incredible array of psionic powers under the disciplines of clairsentience, metapsionic, psychometabolism, and telepathy. These powers included absorb disease, aura sight, chameleon power, chemical simulation, complete healing, conceal thoughts, contact, danger sense, ego whip, ejection, empathy, energy containment, enhancement, gird, identity penetration, intellect fortress, mental barrier, mind blank, mind over body, mindlink, psionic blast, psionic sense, psychic messenger, psychic surgery, spirit sense, thought shield, tower of iron will, and truthear.\nMembers of this race lived solitary, nomadic lives dedicated to preserving and restoring nature on Athas against those who would defile it. They rarely settled in one place permanently, at most taking up residence somewhere for 50 to 100 years, but each pyreen had places they considered it was their duty to guard.\nThey often carried a variety of magical items and at least one concealable magic weapon made of metal, such as a +3 dagger. Magic items often favored by pyreen included cloaks of protection, bracers of defense, and rings.\nThe extent of the pyreen lifespan was unknown – they lived live for thousands of years, but there existed no records of pyreens dying of old age. It was also unknown whether these incredible lifespans were a racial trait or a result of their incredible druidic powers.\nWhile an omnivorous race that enjoyed fine food and wines, like the most powerful of druids the pyreens were capable of sustaining themselves without any nourishment.\nAll of the humanoid and demihuman racial languages of Athas were known to pyreen, as well as supernal. They also occasionally knew some of the other languages that existed on Athas.\nPyreens were sworn enemies of the Sorcerer-Kings and defilers, as they dedicated their lives to undoing the damage both wrought upon the world of Athas. They also had a deep onnection to the spirits of the land, many of them sharing ancestry with primal spirits.\nIn The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14 century DR, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the Malatran Plateau through an elemental gate to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by Athasian elf slavers. Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry sink worm. They seized the opportunity and freed Kacha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.\nAfter two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Kacha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the Windrunners, and their leader, Kirikku. Kacha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Kirikku gifted the aliens four large erdlu eggs (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two apples of healing. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination—the Ringing Forest—the way back to Toril.\nAt some point on their journey to the Ringing Forest, the Malatran heroes ran out of water and were confronted by a female pyreen. She question the heroes, then offered them advice and guidance on reaching their destination, but was unable to stay and help them."
