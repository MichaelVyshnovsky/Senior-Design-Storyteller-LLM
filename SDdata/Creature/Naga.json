        "mainbody": "Nagas () were serpentine creatures of great intellect and natural mastery of sorcery.\nNagas resembled giant snakes with heads that bore a humanoid resemblance. They typically ranged from  in length and weighed around . Though some were known to be over a  in length.\nNagas were known to have a natural affinity for spellcasting, being born with an inherent understanding of the art of magic.\nThough nagas and their deities were perceived as having distinct sexes, they were an entirely hermaphrodite species. A naga could reproduce by copulating with another member of their subrace or simply by impregnating itself. No method was preferred over the other and the choice of method came down to convenience or personal preference.\nMuch like most snake and reptile species, nagas were known to dislike cold climates.\nNagas were created by the sarrukh in the early days of Mhairshaulk as a servitor race. They were created by magically interbreeding powerful serpents with the natural intelligence and inquisitiveness of humans. In their capacity as servitors they served the sarrukh as guards, researchers of magic, and explorers of uncharted lands.\nThe first nagas to be created were water nagas, who were bred for the purpose of exploring the vast lands and oceans of Abeir-Toril. Over time, the nagas helped the sarrukh to establish the foundations of magic in the kingdoms of Mhairshaulk, Isstosseffifi, Okoth.\nthumb|250px|right|A bone naga.\nthumb|right|250px|A spirit naga.\nAfter the fall of Mhairshaulk and Shekinesters split into five guises, five major subspecies of nagas arose, as well as at least four minor subspecies.\n Major Subspecies \n*Dark naga\n*Guardian naga\n*Iridescent naga\n*Spirit naga\n*Water naga\n Minor Subspecies \n*Banelar naga\n*Bright naga\n*Ha-naga\n*Nagahydra\nThere was a particular undead form of naga called bone nagas, normally created as guardians.\nA similar-looking creature created by spirit nagas as servitors was the nagatha.\nBecause of the flexibility their species had in regards to reproduction, the concept of mates held far less importance among nagas compared to other creatures.\nPrior to his fragmentation, all nagas worshiped the World Serpent. Some theologians speculated that their curiosity and questioning over his many facets was what led to him fragmenting.\nFollowing the World Serpents fragmentation and the fall of Mhairshaulk most nagas worshiped Shekinester, a lesser goddess that fragmented from him, and her son Parrafaire. Banelar nagas were known to worship either Bane or Cyric.\nLesser kiira, or \"lore gems\", were commonly created and used by nagas."
