In their capacity as servitors they served the sarrukh as guards, researchers of magic, and explorers of uncharted lands.\n\nThe first nagas to be created were [[water naga]]s, who were bred for the purpose of exploring the vast lands and oceans of [[Abeir-Toril]]. Over time, the nagas helped the sarrukh to establish the foundations of magic in the kingdoms of Mhairshaulk, [[Isstosseffifi]], [[Okoth]].\n\n[[File:Bone naga 3e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A bone naga.'']]",
