Plateosaurus () was a species of dinosaur.
Plateosaurs looked like their cousin massospondylus. They were slow-moving, heavy quadrapeds but had the ability to stand on their rear legs for a short period.
Plateosaurs were herbivores and lived in herds. Their diet consisted of the leaves from ferns, palms and other deciduous trees.
