Rivaling the power of a [[hive mother]], an overseer resembled nothing more than a large mass of flesh or a tree with mouths on its trunk and eyes on its branches.\n\nOverseers possessed powers similar to that of a hive mother and could control the actions of five to ten standard [[beholder]]s or five to twenty beholderkin. However, overseers could only control creatures of the same type. Thus, one overseer could control [[Death kiss|deathkisses]] or [[director]]s but not a combination of the two beholder types.",
        "Society": "A few overseers existed in the beholder city of [[Zokir]], though they were rarer there than in other beholder colonies.",
        "History": "[[Calimshan|Calishite]] records suggest that overseers may have fought in the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]] and earlier wars in [[Calimshan]], along with other beholder abominations."
