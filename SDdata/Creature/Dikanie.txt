A dikanie was a type of gigantic crab found in the Straits of Koryo between the island of Saishu and the mainland Koryo Peninsula in Kara-Tur. These orange-hued crustaceans grew to 30–40 feet (9.1–12.2 meters) in length.No game statistics are given for the dikanie. It may be the same as the giant crab, but that is only 8–15 feet (2.4–4.5 meters) long.
The Straits of Koryo were famed for their huge tidal ranges and speeds. When the tide went out, an unwary sailor could find their boat beached for hours in the mud and easy prey for the dikanie.
