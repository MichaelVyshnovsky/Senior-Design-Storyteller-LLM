        "mainbody": "A kapoacinth () was an aquatic creature related to the gargoyle. They could not fly but instead swam, using their wings to propel them forward.\nMuch like standard gargoyles, a kapoacinth delighted in causing pain to other creatures. Most often humans, merfolk, and sea elves.\nKapoacinth typically lived in shallow waters, often lairing in undersea caves."
