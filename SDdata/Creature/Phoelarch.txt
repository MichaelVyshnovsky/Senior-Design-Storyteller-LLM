'''Phoelarches''' were a race of [[monstrous humanoid]]s, connected to [[elemental fire]], that were believed to be descendants of [[phoenix]]es. Each of them shared a [[soul]] with a bird-like creature known as a [[phoera]]. Whenever a phoelarch died, the phoera tied to it would show up to exact revenge, and vice versa.

==Description==
These humanoids were generally slender and stood taller than [[human]]s, on average reaching heights of {{SIrange|6|6.5|ft|long=yes}} and weighing around {{SI|180|lbs.|k|long=yes}}. Their skin tone varied, with some having the color of dark rust and others having a hint of gold. Brilliant feathers of varying shades of red and gold lined their jaw, as well as the backs of their arms and legs. Much thicker feathers grew on their heads in place of hair. And their eyes had a slight glow to them. Some described their feathers as being like rippling flames.

When engaging enemies in combat, a phoelarch often wore [[studded leather]] armor.

==Behavior==
Phoelarches were almost universally possessed of a terrible wanderlust and were very passionate about freedom, both their own and that of others. They treasured freedom almost more than anything else.

Phoelarches were often rigidly honorable. Their customs and sense of honor varied greatly with each community and individual.

They only had a vague sense of the personality and emotions of the phoera tied to them.

==Abilities==
Phoelarches were impervious to harm from fire, their bodies instead being healed by it. Though they were vulnerable to cold-based spells and abilities. They were also immune to most [[disease]]s and [[poison]]s.

Phoelarches could generate so much heat that touching them would burn a creature. They were also capable of casting a number of spell-like abilities. These included ''[[light]]'' and ''[[scorching ray]]'' at will, ''[[produce flame]]'' three times per day, and ''[[fire shield]]'' once per day.

When killed a phoelarch would explode, sending flames flying outward. In the wake of their death all that would be left was ash and a chrysalis in the form of a small, black glass egg roughly {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} across. A phoelarch could not be [[raise dead|''raised'']] by any means, though their ash and chrysalis could be used to resurrect them. Casting ''[[gentle repose]]'' or a similar [[spell]] on their chrysalis would stop it from hatching, which occurred within a 24 hour period. Once hatched a fully grown phoera would emerge.4th edition's reimagining of phoelarches removed all mention of chrysalises and simply stated that "As long as its other half survives, a slain phoelarch or phoera eventually returns to life."

This ability to rise from the ashes like a phoenix seemed to be tied to the phoera they shared a soul with, meaning that if they died before their phoera could return to life they would likely remain dead.

==Combat==
Phoelarches were deadly combatants, whether they were fighting from a distance or in close-quarters. They typically fought with their spell-like abilities and [[falchion]]s, though those that took up the role of a [[mage]] were known to wield [[dagger]]s. Both types of weaponry often had the [[flaming]] [[item enchantment|enchantment]]. All phoelarches generally preferred to rely upon their spell-like abilities in combat.

Phoelarch [[warrior]]s would deliberately take risks, provoking opportunity attacks to test an enemy's willingness to be harmed by their heated bodies.

==Ecology==
Due to their race's innate wanderlust, phoelarches typically didn't have their own societies and instead lived a nomadic life. Though a few managed to establish villages, which had little interest in outsiders but were not innately hostile.

Phoelarch warriors often acted as mercenaries, but refused work from those that kept slaves. Phoelarch mages often adventured with a mentor to research ancient knowledge or sought out their phoera counterpart in hope that doing so could help them to improve their fire magic.
===Homelands===
Much like a phoera, a phoelarches preferred preferred environment was temperate forests. Though they could tolerate almost any habitable climate and due to their wanderlust they never confined themselves to one type of land for long, instead seeking out new places and people.

In Faer√ªn they were most often found in [[Calimshan]], [[Mulhorand]], and any other lands where slavery was legal. Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], they could sometimes be found in the [[Elemental Chaos]] searching for their phoera counterpart.
===Languages===
Phoelarches typically spoke [[Common]], [[Primordial language|Primordial]], and [[Ignan]]. Though they often picked up other languages during their wanderings, such as [[Celestial language|Celestial]], [[Draconic language|Draconic]], [[Elven language|Elven]], [[Sylvan]], and so forth.
===Relationships===
Phoelarches often allied themselves with adventuring groups and organizations that were opposed to powerful tyrants or slave rings.

==Notable Phoelarches==
* [[Tarsa]], a female [[arcanist]] who lived in the [[Trackless House]] near the [[Pandemonium Stone]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Some rumors claimed that there were phoelarch cities on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].
