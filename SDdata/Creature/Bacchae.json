        "mainbody": "st bacchae looked like attractive [[human]]s, albeit with a feral glint in their eyes, while others resembled [[satyr]]s. Their appearance was always dirty and disheveled, with tears in their clothing or stains from blood, dirt, or wine.\n\nBacchae typically wore [[tunic]]s or loose [[robe]]s, [[sandal]]s or crude leather shoes, and [[chaplet]]s of [[mistletoe]], [[grape]] leaves, or [[laurel (plant)|laurel leaves]]. During the winter season they would wear bulky layers of shawls, woolen [[leggings]], and [[scarves]].",
        "Description": "Most bacchae looked like attractive [[human]]s, albeit with a feral glint in their eyes, while others resembled [[satyr]]s. Their appearance was always dirty and disheveled, with tears in their clothing or stains from blood, dirt, or wine.\n\nBacchae typically wore [[tunic]]s or loose [[robe]]s, [[sandal]]s or crude leather shoes, and [[chaplet]]s of [[mistletoe]], [[grape]] leaves, or [[laurel (plant)|laurel leaves]]. During the winter season they would wear bulky layers of shawls, woolen [[leggings]], and [[scarves]].",
        "Personality": "Bacchae were rarely cruel or malevolent beings, their lives revolving entirely around partying, though they could be very careless when it came to the lives or property of others. They placed little value on appearance, cleanliness, conventional rules, or manners to the point of practically despising them. They appreciated good humor, wit, endurance, and a joy for life, often daring each other to perform ridiculous stunts.\n\nBacchae also had a mercurial nature to them.The 3{{rd}} edition ''Manual of the Planes'' claims on page 145 that bacchae are \"generally nonviolent, fleeing if attacked,\" but this contradicts other sources. Brewers, musicians, and vinters were usually spared their wrath. \n\nIt was not uncommon to see bacchae caught up in a frenzy to suddenly end their attacking with little or no reason before offering their opponents peace offerings in the form of [[ale]], [[wine]], or other food. Sometimes this turn of face lasted only a short time, being a mere pause to catch their breath. At other times, this was an attempt to patch things up, and a sincere recognition of an opponent's skills, especially when they were outmatched, but it could also be a sign of contempt over the brawl posing no challenge for them. Refusing the peace offerings of a bacchae would drive them back into a frenzy.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Transformation": "Anyone who drank and partied with the bacchae long enough would eventually become one themselves, their bodies infused with the Dionysian spirit. This could occur over simply the course of a long evening of revelry. Once transformed a person abandoned their previous lifestyle, becoming obsessed with revelry, and were willing to turn on former allies that attacked the bacchae.\n\nThose transformed into bacchae could be restored to their former self by means of the spells ''[[heal]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[wish]]'', ''[[miracle]]'', or ''[[shapechange]]''. Some claimed that the spell ''[[polymorph other]]'' could restore one's form, but bacchae were immune to such effects."
        },
        "Combat": "Bacchae disdained the use of weaponry, instead preferring to fight in a frenzied manner with their teeth, fists, nails, and legs. Those on the sidelines would hurl any loose items at their disposal, such as rocks and tankards.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Bacchae were known to nomadically roam throughout the [[plane]]s, However, they were typically found throughout the plane of [[Arborea]]'s layer [[Arvandor (layer)|Arvandor]], being most common in the realms of [[Olympus]] In Olympus, the palace of Dionysus acted as sort of a home base for them,\n\nOutside of Arvandor, traveling bacchae were sometimes seen in the halls of [[Ysgard]], partying and doing battle with its petitioners, as well as in [[chaos]] plane of [[Limbo]].",
            "Languages": "Bacchae generally spoke [[Common]] and [[Sylvan]]. They also typically knew the language of whatever region they lived in, as well as the unique languages of [[dryad language|dryads]], [[oread]]s, and [[satyr language|satyrs]].",
            "Religion": "Dionysus and [[Pan (deity)|Pan]] were the patron deities of bacchae.",
            "Relationships": "Bacchae viewed other creatures with a tribal mentality &mdash; either someone was part of their revelry or they were an enemy. They could only be convinced to be accepting of those who were as dirty, drunken, and frenzied as them, with the aforementioned exceptions of those who provided/created music and drink.\n\nThe rowdy creatures were despised and feared by authority figures, seen as forces of anarchy and revolution. They in turn were opponents of [[law]]ful beings, disapproving of any authority figure or group that tried to impose any rules on their lifestyle. They were frequently hunted by lawful organizations; the [[githzerai]] for example were likely to kill them on sight.\n\nBacchae were generally on good terms with a wide variety of [[fey]], including [[dryad]]s, [[satyr]]s, [[sprite]]s, and the [[Seelie Court]]. They were also on good terms with some of the hardier partiers of Ysgard. And many bacchae were members of the [[Children of the Vine]], an offshoot of the [[Society of Sensation]]. \n\n[[Centaur]]s, satyrs, dryads, oreads, some members of the Society of Sensation, and hardy [[elves]] (usually [[wild elves]]) could often be found engaging in their revels.\n\nBacchae sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deity]] [[Erevan Ilesere]] and the [[Olympian pantheon]] as a whole."

        "History": "When the [[Great Modron March#History|Rogue March]] occurred and made its way through Arboria, the bacchae of that plane managed to slow the [[modron]]s momentarily.<ref>",
        "Trivia": "Bacchae could be summoned by the spell ''[[summon monster III]]''."
