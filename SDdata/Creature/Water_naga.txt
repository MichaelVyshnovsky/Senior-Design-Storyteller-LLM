'''Water nagas''' lived within rivers and lakes. They preferred solitude and isolation.

==Description==
Water nagas were about {{SIrange|10|20|ft|long=yes}} long and weighed {{SIrange|200|500|lb|k}}. They had scales that ranged in color from emerald green to turquoise. Along with these were scales in reticulated patterns that ranged from light olive and dark emerald greens to dark browns and greys. Their bodies were lined with frilled spines that stood on edge when excited or agitated.

==Behavior==
Water nagas were known to be very curious creatures with a neutral attitude towards life. They rarely attacked other creatures unless threatened.

==Biology==
The fangs of a water naga were lined with some form of [[poison]].

==Abilities==
These creatures had an innate ability to cast a variety of [[spell]]s, except for those involving [[fire]].

==History==
Water nagas were the first species of [[naga]] created by the [[sarrukh]], specially bred for traveling across the vast land and waters of [[Abeir-Toril]]. 

Sometime after the fall of [[Mhairshaulk]], a group of water nagas attempted to reverse the diverse subraces of naga that had developed in its wake, but their efforts resulted in the creation of the [[nagahydra]]s.

==Society==
===Homelands===
These creatures were typically found inhabiting the deep depths of clear freshwater pools, lakes, and rivers.

Some were known to inhabit the [[River Ashaba]] of [[Cormanthor]],<ref> and many others were found in the [[Nagaflow]] and [[Nagawater]] in Southern Faerun.<ref>

In the [[Zakhara]] region's [[Crowded Sea]], they could be found on the archipelago of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]].<ref>

===Language=== 
They referred to themselves as "Naja'ssara" and to all other beings as "Dista'ssara". The latter term meant "hands of the embodiment", and they even used this term to describe other species of Naga that they didn't consider real nagas, like [[banelar naga]]s.<ref>

===Religion===
It was said that water nagas were among the followers of [[Dagon]].<ref>
