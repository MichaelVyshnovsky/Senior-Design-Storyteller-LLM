        "mainbody": "'''Burburs''' were a species of worm-like creatures.",
        "Description": "Burburs were small creatures with soft, wet skin. They had large eyes and a proboscis which acted as the creatures mouth. A pair of legs grew just behind its head. It used these legs to move about, climb and provided the burbur with a limited ability to move small objects. They had a body odor that smelled like [[cinnamon]].",
        "Behaviour": "Burburs were very docile creatures. They were solitary but occasionally a small group of burburs congregated to consume the same prey.",
        "Abilities": "Burburs were totally immune to detritus effects of [[brown mold]]s, [[green slime]]s, [[olive slime]]s, [[obliviax]], [[russet mold]]s, [[violet fungus]], [[yellow mold]]s, [[yellow musk creeper]]s and [[zygom]]s. They were vulnerable to attacks by jellies and oozes, as well as poisonous gas and spell.\n\nBurburs temporarily absorbed the effects of any mold, moss or slime it recently consumed. This acted as a deterrent to predators. Any predator who ate a burbur  suffered from the negative effects of whatever was the last meal of the burbur, to usually fatal results.",
        "Combat": "Burburs consumed its prey by attacking it's proboscis to the body of their target. It continued feeding until the life drained from its prey.",
        "Habitat": "Burburs created small lairs that they used to rest or recover from injury. A burbur's lair was well hidden and often in the presence of a creature they were immune to. It was common to find a burbur living under the vines of a [[yellow musk creeper]].\n\nIn the [[Crowded Sea]] region, they could be found on the island of [[Djinni's Claws]].",
        "Biology": "Burburs had a unique diet. They fed exclusively on molds, mosses and slimes. Burburs were asexual creatures. They reproduced once a year via budding. A small bump would grow near it's tail, which slowly transformed into a second head. Gradually it grew legs and eventually split from the body, becoming a separate burbur.",
        "Uses": "Burburs were kept as pets by many adventurers due to their abilities against molds, mosses and slimes. If a burbur was not fed once per day, it either tried to escape or attacked its owner. Due to their rarity and demand, they cost up to 1,000 [[gp]] each."
