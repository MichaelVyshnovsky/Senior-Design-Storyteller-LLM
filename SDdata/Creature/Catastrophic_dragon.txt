'''Catastrophic dragons''' were a family of powerful and highly destructive [[dragon|draconic]] species.

==Description==
All catastrophic dragons had the basic draconic form: four legs, great wings, long necks and tails, etcetera. However, though living beings, they were composed of animated elemental matter.

==History==
In the legends surrounding the [[Dawn War]], it was claimed that [[Io]], creator and god of all dragons, was slain by a primordial. In the aftermath, most dragons chose to serve either [[Bahamut]] or [[Tiamat]], but some lost faith in gods altogether and, believing that the primordials would win the war, turned to those powerful entities and offered them their service.

Seven of the primordials accepted the service of these dragons, and transformed- or perhaps corrupted- them into catastrophic dragons. They sowed great destruction during the war, and survived the primordials' downfall only to scatter across the planes.
