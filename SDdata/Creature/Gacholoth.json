        "mainbody": "Gacholoths were a type of yugoloth. They served as the infiltrators and terrorists of the Blood War, causing havoc and spreading panic to all sides.\nA gacholoth had a roughly humanoid appearance. Their bodies were ebony black, and they had four long and powerful legs, each tipped with three sharp claws to aid in climbing. Their well-muscled torsos had two arms, each ending in a hand with four fingers that were tipped with savage, retractable claws. They were usually about 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall. They appeared to be entirely male, as no obviously female ones had ever been observed.\nThese master betrayers had a fondness for deceit and terror that made them well-favored by yugoloth commanders. They might spend even centuries serving and ingratiating themselves to a baatezu or tanarri master, serving with the utmost loyalty, all the while planning for the best moment to torture and slaughter their supposed allies. They would not be outdone by other beings with similar talents for deception, and had an intense hatred of creatures such as succubi, erinyes, and cambions.\nGacholoths also took an interest in the Material plane. If given the opportunity to enter the land of mortals, they would indulge in a great reign of bloodletting, using their abilities to play with their victims like toys.\nGacholoths struck swiftly and savagely, making use of their significant speed and maneuverability. They often struck before their foes could react, then immediately withdrew from combat to wait for another opportunity to ambush their opponents. Their attacks could be so sudden and fierce as to cause an irrational terror that put their foes into a state of shock. Gacholoths did not carry weapons, feeling confident in their skill with their natural weapons.\nThe gacholoths retractable claws allowed them to move rapidly on any surface, be it horizontal or vertical. They could fight equally well from any angle, even hanging upside down.\nIt was unknown how the gacholoths came to be. Something about them resembled a sahuagin, suggesting some distant connection between the creatures, but there was little evidence available to support the theory."
