        "mainbody": "A '''werepanther''' was a very intelligent and rare type of [[lycanthrope]] that could transform into a [[panther]].",
        "Description": "Werepanthers were lycanthropes that had three forms: [[human]] form, panther form and hybrid [[humanoid]] form. The human form was usually dark-skinned and powerfully built, with extremely high strength and dexterity. The panther form looked much like a coal-black mountain [[lion]]. The hybrid form was a humanoid covered in ebony black fur and with a feline face. It had similar eyes to great cats, being yellow with dark pupils. Its teeth were far sharper than the human form, and it was lithe, moving with a predatory walk. Werepanthers had incredibly sharp senses, from keen night vision to acute smell and hearing.",
        "Personality": "These lycanthropes were usually unapproachable, and boasted an arrogant and proud personality.",
        "Combat": "In panther or hybrid form, these shapechangers usually attacked with their sharp claws and fangs, none of which transmitted lycanthropy. However, in human form, they would carry a weapon, usually black [[mace]]s, [[blade]]s, or [[whip]]s. It was possible for werepanthers to inflict heavy scarring on, or even blinding, their foes, if not outright killing them. As with other lycanthropes, they could only be damaged by [[silver]] or [[magic]]al weapons, but silver would only damage half as much as enchanted weapons.\n\nWhen werepanthers fell in combat, whatever state they were in, they would revert back to their original human form.",
        "Society": "When in their purely feline form, these shapechangers acted as great cats would, preferring hunting and recreation over other activities. Werepanthers were often led by an incredibly powerful [[shaman]] or [[witch doctor]], known as a [[panther lord]]. They usually took their human form when humans were nearby, or if they chose to live among humans. However, werepanthers preferred to live an isolated lifestyle, usually in crude huts in tropical landscapes. Some such creatures were cruel and ruthless, living as [[slavery|slaver]]s, capturing slaves to do menial labor for them.\n\nWerepanthers could communicate with other great cats in a cat-like language of growls, roars, and snarls. Whilst in hybrid form (which they greatly preferred), they could communicate with humans, but struggled with some aspects of language.\n\nThey rarely interacted with other humans and, when they did, it would be in a negative manner. Werepanthers preyed upon humanoids in their territory, and swore that [[weretiger]]s and [[wemic]]s were their enemies.",
