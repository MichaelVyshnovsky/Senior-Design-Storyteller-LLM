        "Description": "Void scavvers had jet black skin. Like other scavvers, they had a single large eye that glowed. With a body some {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in length, a void scavver could easily swallow a [[Human|man]]. Its gullet contained a poison that could kill a human in three minutes.\n\nVoid scavvers had superb senses; even invisible creatures were easily detectable by them.",
        "Behavior": "Unlike other varieties of scavver, which were primarily scavengers, void scavvers were primarily carnivores. They would hunt the crew of ships, not just their scraps and waste. Doors and hatches were not enough to keep a void scavver away; the creatures were semi-intelligent and would ram open such portals.\n\nIn the wild, void scavvers lived in isolation. They would fight other scavvers away from their territory, and they instinctively knew not to eat [[brown scavver]]s, which were poisonous to eat.",
        "Notable Void scavvers": "* [[Big Momma]], a large void scavver that terrorized [[Realmspace]].<ref>",
        "History": "''The [[Probe]]'', the [[hammership]] carrying [[Teldin Moore]] from [[Krynn]] to [[Toril]] with the ''[[Cloak of the First Pilot]]'', was attacked by a void scavver, which killed [[Lort|a crewmember]] and triggered Teldin's first accidental use of the cloak's magical powers.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Stories were told among [[spelljamming]] crews of void scavvers of gargantuan size that could bite through the hulls of [[spelljammer]]s."
