        "mainbody": "Drakens were small, three-headed dragonets that inhabited the Calim Desert.\nDrakens looked like smaller, darker-colored blue dragons with three heads. The wings and eyes were tinged with cyan.\nDrakens were known to be irritable.\nDraken breathed lightning in  lines, with each head being to breathe a bolt twice a day, one at a time. Additionally, when biting with two heads at a time, they could also shock the victim with an effect akin to shocking grasp. Drakens themselves were immune to electrical attacks, as well as to sleep spells.\nDraken primarily used their electrical abilities and teeth in combat, never their claws.\nDrakens grew to adulthood within a year from hatching."
