        "Behavior": "Drakens were known to be irritable.",
        "Abilities": "Draken breathed lightning in {{SIAdj|60|ft|adj=long}} lines, with each head being to breathe a bolt twice a day, one at a time.

Drakens themselves were immune to electrical attacks, as well as to sleep spells.",
        "Combat": "Draken primarily used their electrical abilities and teeth in combat, never their claws.",
        "Ecology": "Drakens grew to adulthood within a year from hatching."
