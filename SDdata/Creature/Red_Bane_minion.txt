A red Bane minion was the most powerful and terrifying Bane minion.
Red Bane minions were the fastest and most well-armored of the Bane minions. Their bodies generated heat of extreme temperatures.
These minions were very proficient in combat, much more so than blue and black Bane minions. As such, they could move swiftly, and perform multiple attacks at once. Their savage assaults were much more damaging than the other Bane minions, and they utilized deadly fire breath attacks. They were immune to fire, and could cause even more fire damage if they made use of their natural fire touch abiilties.
