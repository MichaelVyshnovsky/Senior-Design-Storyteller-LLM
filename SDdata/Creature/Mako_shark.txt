'''Mako sharks''' were a species of seawater [[shark]]s that could be found in the [[Sea of Swords]] and the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]].

==Description==
These aquatic predators averaged at {{SI|12'|'"|long=yes}}, with the smallest being at {{SI|9'|'"|long=yes}} and longest reaching {{SI|13'|'"|long=yes}}. Their slick skin was of tan and blue-gray hues.

==Abilities==
Makos, like other sharks possessed impressive sensory organs that could detect the scent of blood from as far as {{SI|300'|'"|long=yes}} away, which drives them into a feeding frenzy. Because of that, mako sharks were considered to be ones of the most terrifying predators of the sea thanks to their speed and agility.

The sharks' feeding frenzy often kicked in during an attack once the creature tasted blood. In this case, the ability was similar to the effects of the ''[[blood frenzy]]'' spell.

==Ecology==
Makos, like their cousins, were predators who consumed [[fish]], by the most part, but did not turn down a meal of an animal or a [[humanoid]]. Makos possessed low intelligence and often acted unpredictably, often ignoring the prey and attacking savagely one moment later.

[[Wereshark]]s were known to take shape of makos.

===Habitats===
Mako, goblin, and hammerhead sharks lived and hunted in the waters around [[the Temple-Under-The-Sea]], the submerged temple to [[Umberlee]] in the [[Fiddler's Green]], one of the underwater region of the Sea of Swords. The Sea of Swords was also home to the giant mako sharks.

In the waters of the Moonsea, a saltwater lake, mako sharks were occasionally fished by the inhabitants of [[Mulmaster]].
