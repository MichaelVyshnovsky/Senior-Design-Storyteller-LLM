'''Berserkers''' were those [[fighter]]s and [[barbarian]]s who could tap into a particularly savage aspect of themselves in order to skip into a furious rage while in combat. Barbarians that followed the '''Path of the Berserker''' saw their [[barbarian#rage|rages]] as the best means to enjoy the thrill of battle, regardless of personal well-being.

==Culture==
Tribal berserkers were believed to have been granted supernatural forces that allowed them to better defend their people. These individuals lived in close-knit groups, often found in less-civilized locales.

==Abilities==
Berserkers focused their efforts on honing their skill with [[:category:melee weapons|melee weapons]] and forewent training with those wielded at [[:category:ranged weapons|long range]]. Similarly, they eschewed most types of armor more cumbersome than [[splint mail]].

These warriors were so named for their ability to "go berserk" and enter into a trance-like rage in battle. Once in this state a berserk fought with exceptional strength and ferocity. They could not be knocked out, were immune to a wide-range of mind-controlling [[spell]]s and effects, and gained resistance to others that attempted to hinder their movement or actions. This fighting style was just as unpredictable as it was effective in battle.

A berserker's rage lasted until every enemy on the battlefield was downed. On occasion they could not differentiate friend from foe and would attack those who were in fact their allies. Afterwards, a berserker became physically exhausted and vulnerable to certain effects they shrugged off during their rage.

The sight of a veteran berserker in battle was so terrifying that some combatants fled from the battlefield entirely.

==Notable Berserkers==
The [[Rashemaar berserkers]] comprised several tribes of fearsome warriors from the far-[[Unapproachable East|eastern]] realm of [[Rashemen]].
