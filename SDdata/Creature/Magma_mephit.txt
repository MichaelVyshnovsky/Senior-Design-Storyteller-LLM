A '''magma mephit''', or a '''lava mephit''', was a [[mephit]] composed of [[Earth (element)|earth]] and [[fire]]. They emitted a red glow and were slow to understand other creatures.

==Description==
They consistently ooze molten lava from their bodies, as if it were perspiration. The heat from their bodies could be sensed from 30 feet (9.1 meters).

==Behavior==
They were the least intelligent of all mephits, being slow minded and the brunt of [[fire mephit]] jokes.

==Combat==
They attacked using their claws and a breath weapon. Their breath weapon consisted of a molten blob of lava which hit a single designated target. If they were encountered in a volcanic region, they regenerated health every few seconds. The touch of a lava mephit automatically dissolved materials such as wood at a slow pace, but melted metal is a matter of seconds, such as [[plate mail]].

They had the ability to ''[[shapechange]]'' into a pool of molten lava, and even ''[[gate]]'' in other mephits of a random type. If they came into contact with large quantities of water, they would harden and move half as fast. This had a down-side for those using this tactic: the contact of the water with the mephit would release a large amount of sulfurous steam, poisoning and nauseating the opponents.

==Society==
===Relationships===
For the few [[urdunnir]] who employed [[arcane magic]], magma mephits were sometimes employed as [[familiar]]s.<ref>
