        "mainbody": "'''Elemental myrmidons''', otherwise known as '''elemental archons''', were a variety of [[elemental]]s created by conjuring and bounding elementals into ritually created suits of [[armor]] to act as servile weapons of war.{{MyrmidonArchon-Connection}}",
        "Description": "Elemental myrmidons were of roughly [[human]] shape, but were typically slightly larger in size. Though they could be even larger, as their size was determined by the size of the armor they were bound to.<ref> They were typically composed almost entirely of a single substance, be it an element or paraelement, though some could be a combination of elements. Only earth myrmidons were seen to have legs on their lower body, others simply having a single large mass of the element they were composed of.\n\nAll myrmidons wore thick armor, typically of a [[plate mail|plate]] variety. These not only protected them against attacks, but contained their form and was integral to their being. After some time they were capable of removing this armor and replacing it with something else, but many never saw any need to do so. When a myrmidon was killed, their armor was all that would remain of them.",
        "Personality": "Elemental myrmidons retained no memories of the free elementals that were bound to create them.\n\nAs creatures that were forged for the purpose of war, their mindset revolved almost entirely around conflict and conquest. When their innate desire to wage war went unsatisfied for a long period of time they would initially become restless, then careless and sluggish.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|43}} Additionally, they had an innate desire to kill non-elemental creatures, a desire that they could not be talked out of.\n\nHowever, elemental myrmidons could not exert a will of their own, they had no personal ambitions. All they could do was follow the commands of their creators, furthering their goals and ambitions. They also had no need for comforts and didn't value material wealth. When an elemental myrmidon was free, not bound to a master, they would prowl the land and indulge in their innate desire to kill non-elemental creatures.",
        "Abilities": "All elemental myrmidons were immune to the effects of [[disease]]s and [[poison]]s, as they were beings composed wholly of elemental essence. They were also impervious to harm from their respective element.",
        "History": "Elemental archons were created by the [[primordial]]s during the [[Dawn War]] as a response to the [[god]]s' use of [[Angel (astral)|angels]]. It was believed that the idea for them came from an outsider. Those most commonly speculated were [[djinn]], an angel, or a deity that had turned traitor to their fellow gods.\n\nIn order to create the archons, the primordials studied nature in the Elemental Chaos. but the gods discovered the secret of their creation and began focusing relentless assaults on the special foundries where they were made.\n\nAt some point, [[efreet]]s managed to steal the secrets of archon creation from the primordials and from them this knowledge eventually spread across the planes.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|42}} After the Dawn War ended an untold number of elemental myrmidons remained, having no master to serve. Some were quickly snatched up by powerful forces in the Elemental Chaos, while those that remained free took up the life of mercenary work.\n\nDuring the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis on [[Toril]], elemental myrmidons were utilized by members of each of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis: the [[Cult of the Black Earth]], the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]], the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]], and the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]].",

        "Society": {
            "Creation": "Some said that constructing an elemental myrmidon required a special foundry, with a special forge built in a significant concentration of elemental energy,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|42}} and a summoning crucible that served as the transformation space. These forges rarely appeared like a common forge, being unrecognizable contraptions of [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[elemental magic]].\n\nCreating elemental myrmidons was a difficult ritual, a crucial element of which was encasing the elemental energies in armor ritually created at the foundry's forge. If this was not done a myrmidon might quickly expire, lack intelligence, or worst of all grow into something more powerful and uncontrollable that sought to avenge its creation.\n\nA working foundry could produce elemental myrmidons as often as the ritual could be performed and for as long as its resources were maintained. The forge's power determined what kind of myrmidon was created.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|44}} A forge with ebbing power could only generate the most basic version, while those at high flow could produce more powerful varieties.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}}\n\nSome notable forges included '''Firespring''' in the [[Char]] district of the [[City of Brass]], from which the resident efreet created fire myrmidons, and a forge located in the [[Crater of Blue Ice]] from which ice archons created more of their own kind.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], some [[druid]]s of the [[Circle of the Moon]] were capable of [[wild shaping]] into elemental myrmidons.<ref>",
            "Relationships": "There was no innate hostility between myrmidons of differing elements. They would freely associate with one another, though infighting amongst them could occur if they lacked strong leadership. They also had no particular loyalty to the primordials.\n\nMyrmidons that were free would sometimes hire themselves out as [[assassin]]s, guards, or soldiers in order to satisfy their innate desire for conflict. They were willing to work for any employer that could guarantee them a fight, even a non-elemental. Some used the payment from these services to purchase tools and weapons that sat gathering dust in their strongholds, providing outsiders motivation to come and siege them.\n\nMany archons were known to serve the evil archomental of their respective element, including Cryonax and [[Yan-C-Bin]].{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|25, 28}} They were also known to serve efreet, [[storm titan]]s, [[earth titan]]s, [[fire titan]]s,\n\nWhen it came to negative relations, all the angels of the [[Astral Sea]] held a burning hatred for the myrmidons and would go to considerable risk to strike at their foundries or strongholds."

        "Rumors & Legends": "It was said that those who knew the proper rituals could enforce the obedience of all archons that emerged from a particular forge."
