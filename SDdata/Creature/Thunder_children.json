        "mainbody": "'''Thunder children''', also known as '''storm children''', '''night rattlers''', or '''lightning-kin''' were a rare and strange species of sexless [[humanoid]] creatures associated with thunderstorms.",
        "Description": "These humanoid creatures had shiny black bodies with gaunt frames, slender limbs, and vestigial wings. They had [[human]]-like faces with pointed ears, fangs, pupil-less eyes that flashed like lightning, and tiny horns on their temples.",
        "Personality": "These creatures had a very capricious nature, very mischievous and malicious.",
        "Abilities": "Thunder children possessed an innate magical ability that allowed them to cast the following [[spell]]s seven times per day: ''[[chain lightning]]'' (which would be shot from their eyes), ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', and ''[[darkness, 15' radius]].\n\nTheir bodies could only be harmed by weapons with a ''+1 or greater [[item enchantment|enchantment]].\n\nIn addition, they were capable of expertly mimicking mundane sounds, such as heavy footfalls or squeaking doors. They could sense any fear within a {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} radius, were immune to feelings of fear and could assume a gaseous form that resembled a small, black storm cloud. They were skilled at hiding and moving silently within shadows.",
        "Combat": "Besides their use of spells and biting, thunder children would attack their victims in a psychological manner by doing things which would heighten unease regarding a storm. Such as loosening doors and windows, banging shutters, or throwing around small outdoor objects.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Thunder children were known to be found in places that were especially gloomy, such as decrepit mansions, old graveyards, and dark castles along a cliffside. Any place that inspired fear in humans, [[demihuman]]s, and humanoids was ideal for them. They dwelled within little caves that they hollowed out from storm clouds.\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], they could occasionally be found in the realm of [[Ravenloft]], whose shadowy gothic atmosphere felt almost like a paradise to them.",
            "Languages": "These creatures spoke [[Common]] in addition to their own language, which consisted of booms, crackles, and howls.",
            "Relationships": "Due to their personalities thunder children were the enemies of many creatures in the Realms. Including [[air elemental]]s, [[djinn]], [[pegasi]], [[cloud giant]]s, and [[storm giant]]s. The latter two considered them to be a nuisance, similar to how [[human]]s regarded [[rat]]s, and referred to them as \"thunder bats\". \n\nThose on the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning never interacted with the native [[lightning quasi-elemental]]s and [[shocker]]s.\n\nDespite the enmity often felt towards them, some thunder children were known to act as companions or servants of [[noble djinni]]."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some rumors claimed that the blood of these creatures could be used in the brewing of a ''[[potion of gaseous form]]'' and ''[[potion of weather control]]''."
