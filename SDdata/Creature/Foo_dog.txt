Foo dogs were the most commonly encountered of the foo creatures.
Like all foo creatures, foo dogs were four-legged beasts with large, flat heads and big eyes, with leonine bodies about three or four feet long. They had long, floppy ears and broad noses. Their tails were short and ended with bushy hair. Their thick fur was usually gold or black, but other varieties&mdashsuch as white, gray, or even green or purple&mdashwere known.
Foo dogs had all the supernatural abilities of other foo creatures. When they barked consistently for over a minute, the thunderous sound would occasionally summon one to six additional foo dogs to their aid. Foo dogs were very intelligent.
Foo dogs had similar personalities to other foos. Foo dogs and foo lions did not usually associate with each other, though they had no hatred towards each other.
Foo dogs attacked with tooth and claw, which caused more harm to evil creatures than non-evil ones.
In their extraplanar homes, foo dogs lived as mated pairs or in packs. They spoke their own language and the language of foo lions. They could also speak the languages of those humanoids with whom they frequently interacted.
Foo dogs in service of Sharindlar were also known to inhabit the Merciful Court, her divine realm in Nidavellir.
Foo dogs ate all manner of inorganic material, including gems and precious metals, especially enjoying silver and platinum.
