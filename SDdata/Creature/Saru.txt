Saru were a species of intelligent gorilla-like apes that dwelt in the jungles of the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur.
Sarus similarity to gorillas came from their strong large upper arms with the span of , and short, stout legs. Some saru were known to resemble orangutans. Saru, on average were between  and . Their entire bodies were covered in black or copper-red fur, leaving faces, palms, and soles of their feet bare. Saru had slight sexual dimorphism, with the females usually being slightly shorter than males.
Saru were kind, curious, and peaceful creatures that felt no animosity towards other sentient species of the jungle. They were friendly towards the korobokuru folk who, for some reason, felt strong antipathy to saru. The only creatures saru truly hated were the dreaded leopard katanga who prayed on and consumed saru children. They also felt a special kinship with animals, whom saru considered to be "persons." Saru delighted in communicating with animals of the Living Jungle and loved being responded to by those creatures who understood them, such as apes, monkeys, humans, and demihumans. This affection for all living things often led to saru approaching hippos, lions, sloths in search of a conversation, and just as often, sent them fleeing for dear life from predators less inclined to converse.
Most saru took on the roles of warriors, thieves, or combinations of thereof. On rare occasions, saru were known for taking religious roles of shamans, exclusively female occupation.
As a species, saru often displayed fright of magic, especially its visual displays, that could leave them paralyzed in fear.
Saru spoke their own complex langue that consisted of vocal sounds like grunts, hoots, and screams, as well as rich use of hand motions and facial expressions. They were capable of learning other languages, and many adventuring saru did. They also knew the ape language spoken by apes and monkeys, and well as monkey katanga.
Because of sarus natural affinity to animals, they were treated as friends by domesticated and wild beasts alike, as if they were under the effects of the friends spell. This ability to commune with animals could be triggered once per day by all saru.
All saru were great climbers but could not swim.

Saru were omnivores. Their diet consisted of vegetables, nuts, roots, insects, and small animals. Despite having a small amount of meat in their diet, saru equated eating flesh to cannibalism, the belief that made them bad dinner guests among other tribes of the Malatran Plateau.
Saru were believed to had evolved from the gorillas of the living jungle. However, the truth of the seeming accelerated evolutionary rate remained a mystery.
As of the 14 century DR, saru were still relatively new members of the Malatran tribes. Sarus first contact with the Nubari and shu happened only a century prior.
In the late 14 century DR, The Year of Discovery on the Malatran calendar, a small unnamed saru village on the shores of the Sleepy Lake fell ill with a wasting sickness. A vein earth spirit named Ligela cursed the saru after one of the villages youths broke a taboo and accidentally fell on a patch of sacred flowers. A group of heroes of the Living Jungle sent from the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba helped the villages survivors to appease the spirit, but the damage done was irreversible. The village was devastated, and the survivors had no other choice but to join another saru tribe.
