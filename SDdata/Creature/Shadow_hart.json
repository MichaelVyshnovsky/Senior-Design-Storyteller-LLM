It had larger hoof prints than more common deer. \nThis deer variant was able to teleport short distances. It was also immune to mind-affecting spells.       \nShadow harts fought using their hooves and antlers. To escape mid-fight, they used their teleportation abilities.\nThe horns of these animals could be used to create cures for some illnesses. The heart could be used to craft a lesser amulet of health. \nThese rare wild herbivores often traveled alone and used their teleportation abilities to quickly travel short distances even when not in danger.\nIn the , at least one shadow hart lived in the foothills connecting Hilltop and Blumberg.

The deer either died or escaped based on the actions of Drogan Drogansons pupil, who either killed the deer, helped it, did not meet it, or avoided it altogether."
