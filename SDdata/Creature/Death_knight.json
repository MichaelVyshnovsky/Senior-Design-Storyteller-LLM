        "mainbody": "A death knight was a mighty undead warrior created by gods of death or other malevolent forces. They were most commonly created from evil humanoids who in life had been blackguards, fighters, rangers, barbarians, and even paladins fallen from grace.\nA death knight appeared similar to how it appeared in life, but it had a decayed body with rotting flesh and pinpoints of light in place of eyes. A death knight often wore fine clothing and armor, especially capes, as a mark of importance. A death knight struck fear into the hearts of weaker creatures.\nA death knight often rode a nightmare into battle and had a variety of undead servants, such as skeletons, wights, and zombies. More powerful death knights had more servants.\n* Hekaton, the storm giant king that was transformed into a death giant by the Red Wizards of Thay.\n* Imbrar I, the fallen paladin-king of Impiltur.\n* Miltiades of Phlan, once punished with the undead existence by Tyr, the paladin redeemed himself and was returned to life after being a death knight for a thousand years. As a human, he retained some of death knights formidable magical powers and resistances.\n* Olanthius, a warrior of Elturel who served his commander Zariel in life and undeath.\n* Vanrak Moonstar, a devout worshiper of Shar, and the twin brother and long-time enemy of the archlich, Alathene Moonstar."
