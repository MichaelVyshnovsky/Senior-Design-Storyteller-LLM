They were considered to be within the purview of [[Gorellik]], and were sometimes used by [[gnolls]] as guard beasts.",
        "Description": "These creatures had tawny gold fur, similar to that of a [[lion]].",
        "Combat": "Due to traveling and hunting in packs these creatures were capable of taking down prey larger than themselves, such as [[baluchitherium]]. They would surround their victims and pull them down to the ground with their vise-like jaws.",
        "Notable Hyaenodons": "A group of thirteen exceptionally powerful hyaenodons served [[Amaunator]] by attacking those condemned by the god.",
        "Trivia": "A hyaenodon could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' [[spell]].<ref>"
