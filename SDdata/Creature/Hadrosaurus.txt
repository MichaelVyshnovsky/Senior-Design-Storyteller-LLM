A hadrosaurus was a type of dinosaur.
Hadrosaurs were herbivores and could stand on either their hind legs or on all fours. Their most distinguishable characteristic was their bone head crest.
If raised from a very young age (ideally immediately after hatching), hadrosaurs could be trained to work as a riding animal.
If threatened, a hadrosaurus could use its tail as a weapon.
