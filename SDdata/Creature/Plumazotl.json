        "mainbody": "'''Plumazotl''' were intelligent, [[bird]]-like creatures made of nothing more than [[pluma]] magic and feathers.",
        "Description": "Plumazotl resembled a cross between a hummingbird and an egret, and ranged from the size of a hummingbird to that of a [[giant eagle]].",
        "Behavior": "They were able to speak, and could cast spells as if they were [[plumaweaver]]s, growing in power with age. They lived in solitary nests containing wonders shaped from their pluma, and would sometimes offer [[human]]s information in exchange for news.",
        "Combat": "While plumazotl did not fear humans, they avoided combat whenever possible. In addition to using their beak and claws, a plumazotl would also use pluma to defend itself and other plumazotl. While they could only be hit by magical weapons, fire was especially effective against plumazotl. Some humans hunted plumazotl in order to use their feathers in pluma magic, especially greater plumazotl, who had enough feathers to be fashioned into a [[plumalitter]].",
        "Ecology": "A plumazotl was created from two plumazotl engaging in a dazzling ritual in which one would pluck a few feathers from the other, and the two would arrange the combined feathers into the image of birds or humans before pouring their pluma into the image. The resulting plumazotl was roughly the size of a hummingbird, and would grow in size as it consumed feathers and pluma until it was roughly the size of a giant eagle. This growth could be greatly accelerated by consuming a [[Create talisman|pluma talisman]]",
        "History": "According to legend, plumazotl were created by a plumaweaver by the name of [[Itzamna Manik]] and escaped captivity shortly before he was smote dead by the gods for his hubris."
