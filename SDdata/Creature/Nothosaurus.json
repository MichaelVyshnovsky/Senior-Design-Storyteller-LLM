They had a long neck that was capable of moving very rapidly.\nNothosaurs were known for being very aggressive.\nNothosaurs attacked prey with great speed. \nNothosaurs were usually encountered in tropical oceans and seas. \nNothosaurs were carnivorous and solitary creatures. They were air breathers and were often seen laying on rocks under the sun, soaking up some sun after a hunt."
