        "mainbody": "'''Fremlins''' were a type of winged [[gremlin]].",
        "Description": "Fremlins largely resembled the standard gremlin, but had skin the color of slate with wings and a plump build. They had large, pointed ears and their wings were like those of a [[bat]]. On average their bodies grew to a height of {{SI|1|ft}}.\n\nThey generally were naked, purposely shunning any clothing or ornamentation, as fremlins believed that there was no need to hide the bodies they were born with.",
        "Personality": "Fremlins were largely friendly, harmless creatures with a tendency towards laziness and whining or complaining about the slightest things. They were very cowardly, superstitious, and liable to act in ways that other creatures considered annoying or obnoxious.\n\nFremlins were always on the pursuit for fun, usually at the expense of others, and ways out of doing real work. They loved to play practical jokes on other creatures, though their humor was less harmful than that of some other types of gremlins.\n\nThey were easily insulted, though unlike the standard gremlin they were not offended by being mistaken for [[imp]]s. Instead, fremlins would fall into a hysterical fit of laughter.",
        "Abilities": "The bodies of these creatures were innately immune to harm from weapons that weren't [[item enchantment|enchanted]].",
        "Combat": "Fremlins most often tended towards being [[illusionist]]s, [[mage]]s, and [[thieves]].\n\nHaving a cowardly nature, they generally avoided combat and fled at the first sign of trouble. Fremlins seldom assisted their allies in it and often wind up hindering their efforts through innocent blunders, such as giving away the location of those in hiding. They generally refused to use weaponry, though when they had to a fremlin would resort to using [[dagger]]s, ''[[pixie sword]]s'', or any number of weapons that were scaled for their size.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Fremlins were herbivorous creatures.",
            "Languages": "Fremlins spoke the basic language of gremlins, including their own dialect and the dialect of [[galltrit]]s, as well as [[common]].",
            "Relationships": "Fremlins were a [[favored monster]] of the [[deities]] [[Aerdrie Faenya]] and [[Brandobaris]]."
