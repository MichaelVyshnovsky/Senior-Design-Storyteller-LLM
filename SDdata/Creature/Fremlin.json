They had large, pointed ears and their wings were like those of a bat. On average their bodies grew to a height of .\nThey generally were naked, purposely shunning any clothing or ornamentation, as fremlins believed that there was no need to hide the bodies they were born with.\nFremlins were largely friendly, harmless creatures with a tendency towards laziness and whining or complaining about the slightest things. They were very cowardly, superstitious, and liable to act in ways that other creatures considered annoying or obnoxious.\nFremlins were always on the pursuit for fun, usually at the expense of others, and ways out of doing real work. They loved to play practical jokes on other creatures, though their humor was less harmful than that of some other types of gremlins.\nThey were easily insulted, though unlike the standard gremlin they were not offended by being mistaken for imps. Instead, fremlins would fall into a hysterical fit of laughter.\nThe bodies of these creatures were innately immune to harm from weapons that werent enchanted.\nFremlins most often tended towards being illusionists, mages, and thieves.\nHaving a cowardly nature, they generally avoided combat and fled at the first sign of trouble. Fremlins seldom assisted their allies in it and often wind up hindering their efforts through innocent blunders, such as giving away the location of those in hiding. They generally refused to use weaponry, though when they had to a fremlin would resort to using daggers, pixie swords, or any number of weapons that were scaled for their size.\nThese creatures traveled in packs.\nFremlins were herbivorous creatures.\nFremlins spoke the basic language of gremlins, including their own dialect and the dialect of galltrits, as well as common.\nThese creatures sometimes became traveling companions of creatures that befriended them or did something to earn their attention. They could be rather tolerable companions, if kept well fed and entertained. If angered or depressed they were likely to disappear for a time, staying away until their minds forgot whatever it was that had made them so upset.\nFremlins were a favored monster of the deities Aerdrie Faenya and Brandobaris."
