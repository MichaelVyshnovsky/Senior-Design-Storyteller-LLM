        "mainbody": "'''Doomknights''' (or '''doom knights''') were [[undead]] corruptions of previously righteous [[Paladin|paladins]].",
        "Description": "These undead were human-sized and visibly muscular. They seemed to be skinless in many places; however, how much skin was missing varied. Some body parts had their epidermis or dermis missing, while others had muscles exposed. These deformations looked like they were inflicted by burns or through skinning. Doomknights wore [[armor]] and a [[helmet]] made of an [[animal]] or monster's skull. It is possible that this helmet wasn't a helmet but a skeletal body party around their head. They had glowing orange eyes.",
        "Personality": "While doomknights were always [[chaotic evil]], before a paladin was transformed into a doomknight, they had to be a previously righteous individual that fell from grace.",
        "Abilities": "Doomknights had high strength and resilience, an inherent minor resistance to [[spell]]s and the ability to shrug off weak attacks and reduce damage from powerful blows. They possessed [[darkvision]]. A doom knight could use magic similar to ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[power word, stun]]'', and ''[[see invisibility]]'', which they could do one to three times a day depending on the ability. They were able to create an aura of [[fear]] around themselves, which forced weak-minded opponents to flee from their proximity. Like many other undead, doomknights were immune to [[death magic]], [[mind-affecting spell]]s, paralysis, and [[poison]]. Because of an inherent strong alertness, doomknights were harder to ambush.",
        "Combat": "[[File:NWN wallpater.jpg|thumb|325x325px|''A doomknight engaging in combat with [[Penguin|penguins]].'']]\nThese undead almost exclusively used [[Greatsword|greatswords]] and [[heavy armor]] in combat. They were however proficient with all types of [[martial weapons]]. While fighting multiple opponents, doomknights were able to perform quick strikes against a new opponent after downing one. When fighting in groups, doomknights were often led by doomknight commander, which, in addition to the abilities of standard doomknights, could create a ''[[blade barrier]]''. Doomknights used their available magic when fighting.",
        "Behavior": "Doomknights followed a simple militaristic structure, where they were led by commanders when in groups. When in groups or alone they were almost always aggressive on sight. [[Necromancer|Necromancers]] and [[Blackguard|blackguards]] that summoned doomknights via the ''[[create greater undead]]'' spell or [[create undead]] ability, respectively, could expect them to follow easy commands. Doomknights sometimes took control over lands.",
        "History": "Around the 1370s [[DR]], one could occasionally encounter these undead all over the [[Sword Coast North]] in burial places or in the service of necromancers. Around the same time period, by using the spell ''[[Tenser's transformation]]'', an individual could [[Polymorph|take on a form]] similar to an [[Elf|elven]] doomknight.",
        "Ecology": "Doomknights could either be found alone or in small to medium groups. They were almost always aggressive on sight. Some of the ways of creating a doomknight were using the create undead ability of blackguards or the ''create greater undead'' spell."
