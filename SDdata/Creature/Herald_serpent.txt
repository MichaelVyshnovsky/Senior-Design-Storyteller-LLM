'''Herald serpents''', or '''herald snakes''',{{Cite organized play/LC/Where the Teak Snakes Slither|7}} were a type of [[snake]] found only in the vast jungles of the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region of [[east Zakhara]].

==Description==
Herald serpents had emerald or sapphire colored eyes and a body patterned with black and gold bands. They were {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} long on average.

==Combat==
A herald serpent's first tactic was to use its silver tongue to flatter aggressors while they planned an escape route using their lightning quick speed. They could climb through tree branches faster than most [[human]]s could run.

If both negotiation and escape failed, the herald serpent would use their incredible speed to bite their opponent. Their fast-acting venom caused the victim to experience intense amnesia which caused them to completely forget their identity, including any spells and abilities, for several hours.

Herald serpents could cast the following spells once per day: ''[[friends]]'', ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', and ''[[invisibility]]''.

==Habitat/Society==
Herald serpents served as the messengers for [[serpent lord]]s who, in turn, imbued them with magical gifts including the ability to fluently speak six languages including [[Midani language|Midani]]. Before this gift was bestowed from a serpent lord a herald serpent was simply a colorful venomous jungle snake. A herald serpent was often returned to its original state after its task was performed. Their enchantment could also be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' by a powerful [[wizard]]. These snakes were often found with other intelligent reptilian creatures.

==Ecology==
Herald serpents ate live prey appropriate for a snake of their size.
