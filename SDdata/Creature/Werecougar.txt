A '''werecougar''' was an exceptionally rare [[lycanthrope]] that dwelt in [[Maztica]].

==Description==
These [[shapechanger]]s were similar to [[weretiger]]s, but could transform into [[cougar]]s instead. They survived in the harsh land of the [[Pasocada Basin]], which was far to the north of the mainland of Maztica, where other humans were scarce.
