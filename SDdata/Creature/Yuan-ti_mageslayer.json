        "mainbody": "Yuan-ti mageslayers were a specialized subgroup of yuan-ti with natural magical abilities.\nYuan-ti mageslayers were largely serpentine in form, about  tall when rearing upright, but they had a humanoid head and arms. Mageslayers weighed about . They had vertical, slitted pupils like a snake and a forked tongue. Their scales naturally came in a wide range of patterns and colors, although they could psionically change the colors of their scales.\nMageslayers were cautious and arrogant creatures that typically fled instead of dying, though they had no such care for their underlings.\nMageslayers, like other yuan-ti, were naturally venomous and had darkvision they also possessed a keen sense of smell. They could detect poison at will. However, mageslayers were distinguished from other yuan-ti by their many natural spell-like abilities and innate sorcerous powers.\nMageslayers could naturally, psionically turn into a viper of varying size, in which they retained their natural venom but the effect was otherwise similar to that of the polymorph spell. They could also innately produce an effect like that of Evards black tentacles once per day, although the tentacles they summoned were coated in poison as well.\nAll mageslayers possessed a number of natural spell-like abilities, being able to replicate the effects of animal trance, cause fear, conceal thoughts (on themself only), and entangle at will deeper darkness, greater dispel magic, neutralize poison, protection from energy (on themself only), and suggestion thrice per day each and baleful polymorph (into a snake only), dimensional anchor, dimension door (for themself and their equipment only), and protection from spells each once per day.\nAs sorcerers, yuan-ti mageslayers typically knew the spells acid splash, arcane mark, dancing lights, detect magic, mage hand, message, open/close, read magic, alarm, burning hands, disguise self, mage armor, unseen servant, bulls strength, cats grace, invisibility, dispel magic, fireball, and scrying.\nIn combat, yuan-ti mageslayers were known to wield shortswords or composite longbows of superb make. They could also crush opponents in their snake-like coils. They preferred to attack in ambushes and preferred to set up traps and deceptions.\nYuan-ti mageslayers were strike leaders for the Coiled Cabal, which trained them, even the ones that werent members. They were ruthless in battle, although they followed orders when told to retrieve items, not damage their surroundings, or capture prisoners alive. Because of their status and importance to yuan-ti operations, they always received the best intelligence regarding laws, politics, and current events of whatever area they were located in.\nWhenever they ventured among humans, they did so only in disguise. Mageslayers were often sent to deal with humanoid spellcasters that posed a threat to the yuan-ti or their intrigues.\nMageslayers had a thorough understanding of their magic, including any potential side effects and unorthodox uses of their spells.\nWhen on missions, yuan-ti mageslayers would use their color-changing hide to silently signal simple commands or phrases to their companions.\nYuan-ti mageslayers were bred by some yuan-ti elders who were concerned about the rising magical prowess and vigor among the Scaleless Ones in Faer√ªn."
