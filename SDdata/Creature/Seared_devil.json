        "mainbody": "eared devils, also called scorch devils were soldiers of the Nine Hells fuelled by their envy to burn the uncharred.\nSeared devils resembled horribly burned or charred humanoids.\nSeared devils were blindly jealous of all unburned creatures.\nSeared devils were naturally resistant to fire. Additionally, the choking, stinking ash they shed left their victims burned, slowed down, and on the verge of vomiting.\nSeared devils attacked by simply throwing their bodies into opponents, snarling as they raced towards the nearest fresh bodies.\nIn the late years of the 15 century DR, the Ashmadai cells of Neverwinter were known to employ the services of seared devils."
