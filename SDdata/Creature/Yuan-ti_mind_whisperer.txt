'''Yuan-ti mind whisperers''' were a type of [[yuan-ti malison]] that revered the deity [[Sseth]].

==Description==
Mind whisperers were a form of malison with a humanoid body and a serpentine head.

==Personality==
Yuan-ti mind whisperers were sneaky, self-important, manipulative, unpredictable, and treacherous. They were also cowards who tended to flee at the first sign of trouble.

==Abilities==
Like other yuan-ti, mind whisperers were immune to poison and could turn into a snake and back at will. They could also innately cast the spells ''[[animal friendship]]'' (on snakes only) at will, and ''[[suggestion]]'' thrice each day. They were also resistant to spells and other magical effects.

As priests of Sseth, they knew the cantrips ''[[eldritch blast]]'', ''[[friends]]'', ''[[message]]'', ''[[minor illusion]]'', ''[[poison spray]]'', and ''[[prestidigitation]]''. They also knew the spells ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[crown of madness]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[expeditious retreat]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', and ''[[illusory script]]'', but could only cast two spells each day. Additionally, whenever they killed or knocked out an enemy, they healed slightly thanks to a blessing from Sseth.

==Combat==
Yuan-ti mind whisperers wore no armor but wielded [[scimitar]]s in combat. They could also attack with their own venomous fangs. Mind whisperers could cause psychic damage twice each day while attacking.

==Society==
Yuan-ti mind whisperers were priests, after a fashion, of the yuan-ti deity Sseth, and they used their power to both convert others to that god's worship and to increase their own personal power. However, they had a habit of using their power to cloud the minds of their enemies, and even among the yuan-ti were known for being unreliable. They were willing to cheat or even kill allies and rivals alike if there was some benefit for doing so.

Like other yuan-ti, mind whisperers were schemers. In particular, they often played the middle ground between two conflicting factions, and so spent a lot of time keeping whatever connections they had to both factions a secret.
