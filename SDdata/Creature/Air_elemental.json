        "mainbody": "An '''air elemental''' (sometimes called a '''wind elemental'''",
        "Description": "When summoned to the [[Prime Material plane]], air elementals typically appeared as an amorphous, ever-shifting cloud. Whenever they made the rare attempt to speak, it resembled either the high-pitched shriek of a tornado or the low rumbling moan of a thunder storm.",
        "Abilities": "Air elementals were capable of altering their bodies in the form of a small whirlwind. Over the ages, the height and diameters of these whirlwinds varied significantly, especially depending upon how powerful an air elemental was. Some were reported to be as small as {{SIrange|8|16|ft}} tall, while others were reported being as tall as {{SIrange|40|80|ft}} tall.\n\nFree-willed air elementals dwelling on desolate moons in [[wildspace]], known as '''moon devils''', contained swirling dust and frost and had cold attacks.\n\nThough they all roughly shared the same abilities, those in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] that were incapable of being summoned were known to possess even greater powers.",
        "Combat": "Air elementals typically fought creatures by either blasting them with strong gusts of wind or shifting into their whirlwind form.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diets": "Air elementals subsisted solely on the consumption of air.",
            "Summoning": "These elementals could be summoned to the [[Prime Material plane]] through use of the spells ''[[conjure elemental]]'', ''[[conjure air elemental]]''. ''[[conjure lesser air elemental]]'',{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn Game Manual|143}} ''[[elemental servant]]'', ''[[elemental summoning]]'',{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal Game Manual|21}} ''[[summon monster III]]'', and ''[[summon monster VI]]''.\n\nThere were also [[magical item]]s that could achieve this, such as a ''[[censer of controlling air elementals]]'',<ref> a ''[[censer for summoning hostile air elementals]]'', ''[[elemental gem]]s'',<ref> the ''[[Elemental Scourge]]'' in [[Kossuth's House]], the [[Zakharan]] instrument ''[[nay of the djinn]]'' (but only if played by a [[bard]] or ''[[rawunin]]''),{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}} and the ''[[Tome of Twelve Seals]]''.\n\nIn terms of [[divine magic]], the [[specialty priest]]s known as [[airwalker]]s were granted the power to summon an air elemental once per day or incredibly powerful ones once per [[tenday]] by their deity [[Akadi]]. Upon reaching a certain level of skill, airwalkers summoned their first air elemental in a religious ceremony called the [[Fellowship of Flight]].\n\n[[Halcyon (specialty priest)|Halcyon]]s, specialty priests of [[Aerdrie Faenya]], had access to the ''conjure air elemental'' spell and the most powerful among their ranks were granted an innate ability to conjure forth an air elemental once per tenday for a period of one hour. Aerdrians notably considered these elementals to not be servants of the priest who summoned them, but rather of Aerdrie Faenya herself and thus were to be respected.<ref>",
            "Relationships": "[[Aerial servant]]s often tried to accompany them wherever they went, but air elementals strove to avoid them. They viewed the aerials as an inferior form of air elemental and discouraged other kinds of air elementals from interacting with them.\n\nThe warping magic of [[Moon dragon|lunar dragon]] lairs produced moon devils in the region, which would dissipate if the dragon died."

        "Notable Air Elementals": "A berserk air elemental dwelled on the [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]]."
