        "mainbody": "'''Warden beasts''' were spiritual representations of non-magical animal groups found on the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] [[plane]], who embodied and personified their ecosystem.\n\n{{Quote|''I am predator, I am prey. I am the delicate balance, the intertwining relationships between all living things. Life takes life. Life begets life. The most profound truth is the bloody struggle to survive by killing and being killed. I protect the animals, I am the animals.''|A warden beast.}}",
        "Description": "The appearance of warden beasts varied widely, with each resembling the animal they represent. However, they were always slightly larger and had the appearance of a perfect specimen of that animal. Some of the many animal groups that were known to have warden beasts included [[antelope]]s, [[bear]]s, birds, [[deer]]s, [[elephant]]s, insects, [[lizard]]s, and [[wolves]].\n\n[[File:WardenBeasts.png|thumb|''A warden beast [[bear]] and [[rabbit]] stand alongside each other'']]",
        "Personality": "Unlike the animal they represented, a warden beast had an average level of intellect, though they generally acted like those animals until some threat to their ward presented itself. They also would react to outsiders in the same manner as those animals.\n\nA warden beast would take whatever steps were necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals under its care. It would never have any concern for the greater good.",
        "Biology": {
            "Reproduction": "Besides other warden beasts, these creatures were capable of reproducing with mundane animals and [[animal lord]]s. However, the offspring would always be a warden beast."
        },
        "Abilities": "Warden beasts possessed a magical [[empathy]], being capable of sensing the true emotions of any creature around them. They were also tied on a primal level with their ecosystem, making them more than likely to become aware of any event that occurred within {{SI|5|miles}} of their home. Because of this link they could contact any animal within that same radius on a basic level and issue basic actions, such as fleeing, calming down, or swarming. However, this was only done for dire emergencies.\n\nDue to their spiritual nature, a warden beast possessed abilities similar to the following [[spell]]s:\n:''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[animal growth]]'', ''[[animal summoning I]]'', ''[[commune with nature]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[detect snares and pits]]'', ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', and ''[[protection from evil]]''.\n\nIf they or their animal counterparts were seriously threatened, a warden beast could attempt to summon their applicable animal lord once per day.",
        "Combat": "Each warden beast fought in a similar manner to the animal they represented, though there was more power behind their attacks. They generally did not engage in combat and attempted to avoid, only doing so when it was necessary or in the best interest of the battles over which they had dominion. Warden beasts that represented predatory creatures, however, were a bit more likely to engage in combat.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "The dietary habits of warden beasts varied based on what animal they represented. Those that represented predatory species would similarly stalk and hunt prey in order to eat.",
            "Languages": "Warden beasts were capable of speaking both [[Common]] and the language of any animal.",
            "Relationships": "The deities of the [[upper planes]], in particular those of the Beastlands, had little interference in the lives of warden beasts and they were often beneath their notice. Warden beasts in turn had little concern for the affairs of deities, [[human]]s, or other societies.\n\nWarden beasts were a [[favored monster]] of the deities [[Haela Brightaxe]], [[Thard Harr]], and [[Rillifane Rallathil]]."
        },
        "Notable Warden Beasts": "* A warden beast in the form of a [[spotted lion]] served under the [[cat lord]], ensuring the well-being of all felines in the Beastlands."
