'''Tentamorts''' were strange, spherical creatures of unknown origin, that were rarely encountered. Some believed that they were distantly related to [[squid]]s.

==Description==
Tentamorts had grayish-green, chitin-covered spherical bodies {{SI|2|ft}} in diameter, which lacked any form of eyes or mouth.

Protruding from the body of a tentamort were eight small tentacles that were used to move around at a slow pace. They were lined with suction cups or "suckers", allowing it to firmly adhere to any surface. Located right above these tentacles were three blow holes from which the creature breathed.

On each side of its body was one {{SIrange|10|12|ft|long=yes}} long worm-like tentacle, {{SI|5|ft}} in diameter. One of these tentacles was tipped with a {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}}, hollow bone-needle.

==Behavior==
These creatures were known to possess no form of intelligence. They had an aversion to severe heat and cold. Unless starving for sustenance, tentamorts would attempt to flee from creatures once any their tentacles were destroyed.

==Abilities==
The spherical body of a tentamort contained all its vital and sensory organs. Though they lacked visual senses, they had a delicate organ that sensed body heat.

Tentacles destroyed on their bodies would gradually regenerate over the course of a week. Thus the only known way to truly kill a tentamort was by attacking its spherical body.

==Combat==
[[File:Tentamort.png|thumb|338x338px|''Tentamort attacks two adventurers in a dungeon with its long tentacles.'']]
Tentamorts would flail at opponents with their two long tentacles or grapple them, wrapping around a victim and pinning their arms to the side. While both tentacles were utilized this way, only the one lacking the needle bone would constrict victims. If more than one creature was in range, the tentamort would divide its attention between two.

The tentacle tipped with a hollow bone-needle would jab into a constricted victim's flesh, often paralyzing them. Through this bone-needle the tentamort would then inject saliva-like fluid, with the amount varying depending upon the size of the entrapped creature. This fluid caused the victim's organs internal organs and muscles to gradually dissolve, which the creature would then suck out through the hollow bone-needle. If thoroughly damaged, the tentacle would detach from its victim.

Creatures injected with this fluid needed to be administered the [[spell]] ''[[cure disease]]'' within an hour in order to survive, followed by any manner of powerful curative magic. Such as ''[[cure wounds]]'', ''[[heal]]'', and even ''[[regenerate]]''.

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], tentamorts were known to be occasionally encountered in both the ruins of [[Undermountain]] and the sewers of [[Waterdeep]]

==Ecology==
Tentamorts were a hermaphroditic species, allowing both specimens that engaged in mating to produce young. Newly born offspring generally weighed {{SIrange|2|3|lbs}}.
===Habitats===
Tentamorts tended to be found inhabiting either dungeons or murky swampy. Beyond [[Toril]], they were also known to be found on the planet of [[Oerth]].
===Lairs===
In dungeons such as Undermountain, tentamorts were known to hide themselves within small niches or cavities, as well as behind tapestries and hidden doorways. They tended to clump together in such environments around a single entrance or bend, in nests of up to ten specimens.

In swampy environments a tentamort nest was more dispersed. The creatures would often wrap their tendrils around various trees and hide them within the murky water.
===Usage===
The [[poison]] gland within a tentamort, that which produced its saliva-like fluid, generally sold for around 10 to 40 [[gold piece]]s. This was typically sought after by assassins.
