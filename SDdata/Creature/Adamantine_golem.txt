An '''adamantine golem''', sometimes called an '''adamantite golem''', was a huge and extraordinarily powerful [[construct]] of unmatched strength.

==Description==
Adamantine golems generally looked similar to [[iron golem]]s, but were more ornate, and gleamed as [[adamantine]] would. Such golems stood five times as tall as [[human]]s, but weighed 200 times as much, totaling around {{SI|32000|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
These constructs did not and could not speak, and did not have a scent. They moved around twice as slow as [[human]]s, but their mighty stomp caused the ground to shake, which could be felt up to {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} away.

==Combat==
Adamantine golems were nearly impossible to beat in combat. Getting too near to such constructs could cause the combatants to be stomped, instantly killing all but the most skilled adventurers. The constructs were ''completely'' immune to [[magic]]al and supernatural effects which made attacking safely from range a large problem.

==Creation==
These golems were, in the first stage, constructed from large amounts of [[iron]], which was then [[magic]]ally changed into adamantine, by using a ''[[wish]]'' [[spell]]. They were extremely expensive to craft, at 525,000 [[gp]], making them even more valuable than [[spelljammer|spelljamming vessel]]s, such as [[neogi deathspider]]s. Only the most excellent combination of magic, and epic craftsmanship of both [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s, could even attempt to make adamantine golems. Furthermore, the construction of these golems would permanently drain the mages of power. The mages also needed to be able to cast an array of the most powerful spells known, such as ''[[Bigby's crushing hand]]'', ''[[geas/quest]]'', and ''[[wish]]''.{{Cite web/Epic Level Handbook Errata}} For these reasons, adamantine golems were very rare, and were almost never found by adventuring parties.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}},{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} [[Gorion's Ward]] encountered an adamantine golem alongside two [[stone golem]]s while adventuring in the labyrinthine lair of [[Firkraag]].
