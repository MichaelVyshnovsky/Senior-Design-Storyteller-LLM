They had the general appearance of humans, but with the addition of differing fiendish traits.\n* Alu-fiend A specific term used for the offspring of a succubus demon and a mortal male. Alu-fiends tended to be very attractive in appearance, but with small, bat-like wings and sharp teeth.\n* Draegloth A very specific variety of half-fiends, draegloths were the offspring of drow females and glabrezu demons. Draegloths were tall (7â€“8 ft), with the obsidian skin and white hair of drow but a somewhat hound-like head, four arms like a glabrezu (the larger, upper pair ended in huge claws), and a mane of hair covering their backs and shoulders.\n* Durzagon Durzagon were the result of the union between a duergar and a devil. They were often revered by other duergar as great leaders.\n* Isair and Madae Leaders of the Legion of the Chimera."
