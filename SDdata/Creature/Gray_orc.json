        "mainbody": "'''Gray orcs''' were more civilized [[orcs]] than others who lived in the [[Moonsea]] and [[Hordelands]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Gray orc males were typically {{SIrange|5'0\"|6'10\"|ft-in|long=yes}} in height and {{SIrange|154|438|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight, while females were typically {{SIrange|4'7\"|6'5\"|ft-in|long=yes}} in height and {{SIrange|114|398|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note\"/>\n\nThey were rather hairy, with long \"manes\" of black bristles on their head, shoulders, and back. They had wolfish ears, and their faces were somewhat less porcine than those of [[mountain orc]]s, though they retained the tusks and were still obviously orcish.\n\nIn coloring, gray orcs typically had red, orange, or yellow eyes, black hair, and gray skin with mottled patches of darker or lighter shades on the chest and flanks. Unlike mountain orcs, they typically wore more \"civilized\" clothing, normally in shades of black, brown, blue, and other dark colors.",
        "Personality": "Gray orcs were just as savage and barbaric as mountain orcs, but lacked the drive to conquer and enslave of their northern kin. They preferred to trust their hearts and instincts over logic, and were likely to react suddenly and irrationally to events. Given the opportunity to attack a hated rival, a gray orc would not hesitate even if that same rival had defeated them countless times before. Even so, gray orcs were noted to be calmer and more collected than mountain orcs.",
        "Abilities": "Gray orcs were strong and fast. Due to their long strides they were capable of rapidly covering significant distances on foot.  \n\nLike other orcs, gray orcs possessed [[darkvision]], but were also sensitive to bright light. And they had a keen sense of smell.",
        "Combat": "Gray orcs preferred to wear light armor in combat, as it allowed them to fight relatively unencumbered and to use their speed in battle. Their warriors typically trained as [[fighter]]s, [[barbarian]]s, and occasionally [[ranger]]s.\n\nGray orcs were skilled with the [[longbow]] and [[greataxe]], as they began training with these weapons in childhood. Gray orcs considered the axe a holy weapon, and a gray orc spent considerable time maintaining his axe, constantly repairing even minor fractures and dents. Their axes were often garishly adorned with tokens of beads, feathers, gems and even small body parts taken from their fallen enemies. Most gray orcs kept a tally of enemies killed with their axe, either by making a notch in the handle or inscribing their target's name on the axe head.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Gray orcs spoke a more verbally complex variation of [[Orc language|Orcish]], similar enough to the common form that anyone who spoke Orcish could understand it. However, many words, inflections, and pronunciations varied wildly between tribes and learning the idiosyncrasies of each tribe normally took a few days to learn. Grey orcs were not, however, literate, nor were they fond of learning new languages. The clerics would at least speak [[Common]] in order to interrogate captives, and potentially [[Giant language|Giant]] and [[Goblin language|Goblin]] in order to converse with potential allies.",
            "Magic": "Most spellcasters among gray orcs were [[Divine magic|divine spellcasters]]. [[Arcane magic|Arcane spellcasters]] were rare, and gray orc [[druid]]s even rarer. During the [[Orcgate Wars]], gray orc clerics had access to many powerful and unique spells; the most potent of these [[magic]]s being their ability to directly call down [[avatar]]s of their [[deity|deities]]. Knowledge of this magic was lost with their defeat, as a result gray orc clerics used more common clerical spells.  \n\nGray orc spellcasters crafted potions and scrolls for themselves or for the benefit of their tribe. Most magical items found in the possession of gray orcs were most likely stolen or looted.",
            "Religion": "Gray orcs acknowledged [[Gruumsh]] as the most powerful and leader of their deities, but unlike other orcs, gray orcs didn't feel the need to focus their worship solely on Gruumsh. They instead worshiped all the [[Orc pantheon|orc deities]] equally. They often worshiped whichever deity suited their interests and personality, although most gray orcs of a given tribe would worship the same deity."
        },
        "History": "Gray orcs first came to [[Toril]] in the year [[-1081 DR]], when the Theurgist Adept [[Thayd]] opened a portal to another world, a savage one dominated by fanatically religious orcish empires. Thayd was executed soon after he opened the portal, before he told anyone else on Toril of its location, and it thus lay dormant for five years until the orcs discovered it in [[-1076 DR]] and began to migrate through. They promptly attacked both [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]], beginning a six-year conflict that was later named the [[Orcgate Wars]].\n\nThe initial attack rapidly escalated into a devastating war, as orcish warriors slew thousands and the orcish clerics wielded new and powerful spells.\n\nTwo years after the Battle of the Gods (in [[-1069 DR]]), the remaining Mulhorandi and Untheric forces and deities banded together to defeat the orcish hordes so thoroughly that the gray orcs had yet to recover hundreds of years later. Instead they fragmented into hundreds of small tribes, whose constant infighting barred them from regaining their lost power."
