'''Raik''' were aggressive and carnivorous [[fish]] that dwelt in the depths of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Description==
Greater raiks, the bigger species, were the size of an adolescent [[human]]. They had fins splattered with white and blue colors. Their most notable feature was their hooked jaw. Lesser raiks were significantly smaller in size.

==Behavior==
Unlike their lesser kin, greater raiks were territorial, fearless, and extremely aggressive. They relentlessly attacked other fish or any other intruders within the borders of their territory. More often than not, raiks attacked creatures to complete disregard for their own lives or chased the intruders until they are gone far from the raiks' home. Their natural aggression let them to attack creatures as big as three times their own size.

==Ecology==
Raiks were carnivorous hunters who killed indiscriminately. They had few natural predators. Huge creatures like [[mottled sidi octopi|mottled sidi octopi]] were known to fight and be killed by raiks.

Fishermen were known to pursue these dangerous creatures but catching them was a perilously impressive task.
