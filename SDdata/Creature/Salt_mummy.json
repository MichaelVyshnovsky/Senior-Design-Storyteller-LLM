        "mainbody": "Salt mummies were a form of undead that arose from the bodies of those that died carrying a great sin, the horror of which gradually created a linkage to the Negative Energy plane, and were buried too close to veins of salt.\nSalt mummies were humanoid figures, typically  tall and weighing around . Their bodies were so minerally encrusted and dried out from the salt they were buried near that it was impossible to determine what race they were in life.\nSalt mummies were supernaturally arid. They uniquely possessed the ability to evaporate moisture from anything they touched, even plants and water elementals.\nAll forms of water harmed salt mummies as though they were holy water.\nSalt mummies were typically found either solitarily, in pairs, or in clusters of five to nine individuals.\nSalt mummies were known to haunt some of the larger salt caverns beneath Faer√ªn. Most notably they could be found in the Buried Realms near the ruins of Tethyamar, beneath the Raurin desert, and the Darklands. In particular, the area of the Darklands near the Troglodyte Warrens of Traaskl Thorog, beneath Chessenta."
