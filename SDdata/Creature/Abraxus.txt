An abraxus was a magical creation similar to a golem or automaton.
The abraxus were created by Chondathan mages to defend Sembias Chondathan borders.
An abraxus was responsible for an assassination attempt on King Pryntaler Obarskyr of Cormyr in 1188 DR but it was disabled and the threat was removed.
An abraxus was the center of the abraxus affair in 1369 DR when King Azoun IV of Cormyr was struck down by the creature.
