        "mainbody": "A '''gloura''', sometimes called a '''glouras''', and referred to as a '''unicorn of the deep''', was an exceptionally rare [[fey]] creature of the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "Glouras were delicate and exceptionally smart [[humanoid]]s that had a pair of dull wings and silver skin. They used their moth-like wings to fly at fairly high speeds; these creatures were twice as fast flying than they were running. They had large, dark eyes and wore homemade clothing, and usually carried [[weapon]]s or instruments.\n\nWhen they flew through the Underdark, their shimmering wings made droning sounds that were described as beautiful. Any creatures that fell to the beauty of the song became entranced, willing to follow the faeries wherever they went.",
        "Personality": "Such creatures were very elusive, seldom being mentioned, but seemed to be kind and warmhearted. These fey believed in nurturing other beings, and would reach out to those that needed healing.\n\nGlouras sang and laughed more than they spoke. They also didn't distinguish between sentient and non-sentient creatures.\n\nHowever, although most were [[good]]-natured, a small fraction were not. Known as ''devious'' glouras, these beings were vicious and greedy, and used their skills and charm to gather wealth. As glouras were known to be good, the devious glouras used [[spell]]s such as  ''[[undetectable alignment]]'' to their advantage, and would ''[[enthrall]]'' other beings.",
        "Combat": "In general, glouras didn't like combat. Instead, they would prefer to befriend others, especially surface-dwellers who might not be as [[evil]] as their underground folk. However, they were noted to despise creatures of daylight, attacking them at will.\n\nWhen forced into combat, such fey used an array of [[spell]]s, though they were not offensive, and usually focused on control or escape. They used spells such as ''[[charm monster]]'' and ''[[invisibility]]'' to avoid combat scenarios.",
        "Society": "Glouras seemed to be solitary and self-sufficient creatures, rarely forming groups. However, on nights of a new moon, they would ascend to the surface and seek out members of the [[Unseelie Court]]. Here, they would frolic with them until the sun rose.\n\nTypical dwellers of the Underdark, except for the most [[evil]], usually respected glouras; some even erected shrines to them and provided food. Of these such societies, if their kin were close to death, they would sometimes leave them at such shrines and hope that a gloura would come and heal them.\n\nDespite their rarity, these faeries were known to exist throughout the subterranean lands of the [[Upperdark]]. For example, a triplet of glouras owned a small festhall in the [[drow]] city of [[Sshamath]].\n\nSome believed that these fey were the messengers of the drow goddess of nature and life, [[Eilistraee]]. However, many believed that they were, instead, loyal to the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], owing to their fey nature.\n\nTheir shimmering wings were highly valued, mainly for decorative purposes. Wings of these rare creatures sold for up to 400 [[gold piece]]s."
