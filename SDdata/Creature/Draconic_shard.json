        "mainbody": "A '''draconic shard''' was a [[psionic]] remnant of a powerful [[gem dragon]] whose mind had persisted after death.<ref name =\"FTD-p180\"><ref name =\"FTD-p41\">",
        "Description": "When a powerful gem dragon died, their essence could live on as a draconic shard through sheer force of will. A shard looked like a shimmering, ghostly echo of the dragon as it was in life, but they rarely appeared as such.<ref name =\"FTD-p180\"/> Instead, they often concealed themselves within an item, weapon, or treasure by channeling their psychic essence into it.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"><ref name =\"FTD-p180\"/>\n\nDraconic shards were [[incorporeal]] [[undead]] beings, requiring no sustenance or rest and able to freely pass through solid objects.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"/>",
        "Abilities": "A shard could possess nearly any object, whether [[magic]]al or mundane. Upon making an object into their vessel, they effectively [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] it. The shard could perceive and communicate with the outside world from within their vessel, and could cause the object to move and fly. When an object was possessed by a shard, it became marked by a large cracked [[gem]] of the type which the dragon was in life.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"/>\n\nDraconic shards could not be destroyed conventionally. Defeating the shard's spectral form, or destroying its vessel, could force them to retreat into the form of a cracked gem of the type which the dragon was in life.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"/><ref name =\"FTD-p180\"/> In this form, it had to rest and recuperate for up to two tendays before the gem dissolved and the shard could reform.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"/> Only by destroying this gem could the shard be slain.<ref name =\"FTD-p180\"/>",
        "Personality": "Draconic shards preferred to remain concealed within the object they inhabited. However, from these objects they would continue to pursue the goals they had in life, and would seek out [[adventurer]]s to assist them in these aims. The draconic shard would often present itself as a [[Sentient item|sentient]] magic item in order to accompany these individuals.<ref name =\"FTD-p180\"/> If the shard inhabited a weapon or piece of equipment, it could grant enhanced power to a wielder's attacks or protection from psychic assaults.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"/>",
        "Combat": "A draconic shard was a powerful and resilient opponent. They could psychically deflect oncoming attacks, and nonmagical weapons did little to harm them. Likewise, [[fire]] and [[acid]] were inefficient means of harming a draconic shard, and they were completely immune to the cold and impervious to necrotic or psionic energies.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"/>\n\nA shard would attack quickly and repeatedly using its potent psionic powers, and would use [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] force to rend, crush, stun, and throw their enemies. They could also psychically [[Dominate monster|dominate]] creatures through their sheer force of will&mdash;turning them into little more than puppets&mdash;and could freely ''[[Detect thoughts|detect]]'' their opponents' thoughts. Draconic shards could turn themselves ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'' at will.<ref name =\"FTD-p181\"/>",
        "Notable Draconic Shards": "* In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[amethyst dragon]] [[Eldenser]], known as \"the Worm Who Hides in Blades,\" had become a draconic shard. He used his powers to jump from one [[blade|bladed]] weapon to another, continuing to observe the world as he had done in life at the side of famous adventurers."
