'''Shades''' were humanoids who had merged with the essence of [[shadowstuff]]. They were said to have traded away their very [[soul]]s,{{Page needed}}

{{Quote|Understand Tamlin, that becoming a shade does more than simply transform your body. You will no longer be human. You will live alone, with history as your companion. Your family will die, your friends, even elves die and you live on. Everything will crumble and you will continue.|[[Rivalen Tanthul]].}}
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
While their size varied depending on race and stature pre-conversion, shades generally appeared more slender than other [[humanoid]]s. Their skin looked wholly lifeless, in hue ranging from ash-gray to black, becoming darker as they got older. 

Shades had black eyes,

===Creation===
Initially, shades of the Realms were not born but rather created by one or more magical processes.

Becoming a shade was also possible by completing a ritual in the [[Fane of Shadows]], the temple of [[Shar]] that shifted in and out of the [[Prime Material plane]].{{Page needed}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|Shade! Like the Netherese? Burn me, Cale! Those dark hearted bastards aren't even human. I've heard...|[[Jak Fleet]].{{Page needed}}}}

Shades each had free will, and were not inherently [[evil]], but often dedicated themselves to malevolent leaders or causes. They were generally calm, calculating individuals that preferred to act without others taking notice.

The shades of Thultanthar had an insulated society, separated from that of neighboring Realms. They were a cold and aloof people who kept old and often outdated sensibilities. A select few were chosen as ambassadors of the enclave, and dispatched to speak for their people in foreign lands.

Shades often preferred drab, dull-colored, while those from Thultanthar wore attire that seemed otherworldly to the people of Faerûn.

==Abilities==
{{Quote|I am a shade...I am stronger in the darkness. My hand regenerated entirely at night or in darkness. I can travel from one shadow to another in an eyeblink, covering a bowshot or thirty leagues. My flesh resists magic. As far as I can determine, I no longer age.|[[Erevis Cale]], to Hulorn [[Thamalon Uskevren II]].<ref name=Shadowbred-p185">}}
Shades grew more powerful in areas of darkness or shadows, but weaker when exposed to direct sunlight.{{Page needed}} They possessed an inherent form of regeneration, and even regrow lost limbs while cloaked in shadows.{{Page needed}} A shade's regenerative powers could be negated by contact with [[radiant energy]].

They held powers associated with the [[Shadowfell]], such as the ability to leap from shadow to shadow, to create shadowy duplicates of themselves, and even to become entirely invisible. They could also decrease the amount of light in an area and could see through darkness, even of the magical variety.

They could [[darkvision|see in complete darkness]], including, unusually, magical darkness.

==Relationships==
Shades were among the [[outsider]]s most generally feared across the breadth of [[Faerûn]]. Shades in turn believed themselves wholly superior to all non-shades in existence.

==History==
[[Netheril|Netherese]] shades were first created through the research of Netherese [[wizard]]s who left Faerûn for the [[Plane of Shadow]]―the previous iteration of the Shadowfell―for research purposes long before the kingdom's fall at [[Karsus's Folly]] in the -4{{th}} century DR. During this journey, it was found that by removing a part of one's soul and replacing it with the essence of shadow, a shade could be produced. This was an extremely complex and painful process, but the result was a being with a prolonged life and a greatly strengthened set of abilities when in the presence of shadows.

Like the Shadovar of Netheril, many [[Eshowe]] of [[Chult]] also became shades, particularly [[priest]]s of [[Eshowdow]], the Shadow Giant, and [[mage]]s who were members of the [[Abuya-Deimshowa]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Thultanthar]], then home to many shades in service to [[Shar]], returned to Faerûn after centuries in the Plane of Shadow. As directed by the city's [[Princes of Shade]], a select few [[Shadovar]]―citizens of Thultanthar―were rewarded for their immense loyalty to the city by being made into shades. 

Some adventurers of the Realms took up the mantle as [[shade hunter]]s, vowing to stop the Netherese shades and hinder their efforts to recreate their ancient empire at all costs.

==Notable Shades==
* [[Alauneth Orrane]], the original [[Black Viper]] of [[Waterdeep]].
* [[Erevis Cale]], a retired assassin and [[Sembia]]n butler who lived a second life as an adventurer, before discovering he was the [[Chosen]] of [[Mask]].{{fact}}
* The [[Faceless Incanter]], the shade that infused the ''[[mythallar]]'' of [[Synod]] with the [[Shadow Weave]].
* [[Kesson Rel]], the former Chosen of Mask from the world of [[Ephyras]], who forsook his deity for the goddess Shar.
* [[Telamont Tanthul]], the famous [[arcanist]] and ruler of the returned Netherese empire.
