Their four prehensile limbs were tipped with sharp nails, which alongside their prehensile tails made them adept climbers. They could suspend themselves upside-down, and often used this to their advantage when hunting for prey.\nThe creatures had filthy gray fur, black faces, and blood-red paws. They were known to inhabit both underground areas as well as open-air wilderness, \nEvil and chaotic by nature, it was a matter of debate among druids whether su-monsters were considered sentient or not. Beseeching his god, Silvanus, the druid Newander was able to determine the primates as self-aware, and thus fair game to kill.\nSu-monsters often lurked hanging upside down while waiting for prey to pass them by.\nIn addition to fighting using their jaws and extremely sharp nails, su-monsters possessed a limited amount of psionic ability. They were also known to fight by picking up and throwing rocks.\nSu-monsters were most often found in groups of up to twelve individuals, often forming family units consisting of two adults, one male and one female, along with several offspring. If an individual member of the family was threatened, the other members would fight ferociously in their defense.\nSu-monsters typically inhabited forsaken areas of wilderness or underground lairs. They were particularly known to be found in the Snowflake Mountains as of 1361 DR, and were prevalent on the Yadd al-Djinni islands of Zakharas Crowded Sea in the same period.\nIn the Lands of Intrigue, su-monsters could be found on the island of Olodel.\nThe su-monsters residing on the island of Taramuri in Kozakura possessed such ferocity that they effectively deterred fishermen from establishing a village on the island or venturing into its interior.\nSu-monsters were known to form temporary and chaotic partnerships with keches. Together the groups of ravenous keches and su-monsters were known to ravage through villages in or close to forests, leaving no survivors. These raids were generally commenced in moonless nights but the partnerships never lasted due to unruly natures of all parties involved.\nWongo, one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult, was a su-monster."
