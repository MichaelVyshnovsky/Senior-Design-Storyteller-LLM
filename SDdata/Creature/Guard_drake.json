        "mainbody": "'''Guard drakes''' were large reptiles that were created by a magical ritual involving [[dragon]] scales. They were loyal allies to their masters and could be quickly trained to follow simple commands.",
        "Description": "Guard drakes resembled the type of dragon they were created from in appearance, except stunted and wingless, with a squat and muscular build. Drakes were incapable of reproducing.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were territorial and obedient. They could be trained to perform tasks typically associated with watchdogs.",
        "Combat": "In combat, the main weapons employed by a guard drake were its bite and strong tail. It also shared some of the traits of the original dragon, such as a natural resistance to [[acid]] if created from [[black dragon]] scales, lightning if coming from [[blue dragon]] scales, [[poison]] if coming from a [[green dragon]], [[fire]] if coming from a [[red dragon]], and cold if coming from a [[white dragon]].",
        "History": "The ritual associated with the creation of guard drakes was developed by the [[Cult of Tiamat]], but it was also commonly found among other groups.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] made extensive use of guard drakes among its members.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Creation": "The scales necessary to create guard drakes needed to be given freely by the original dragon. This usually meant that a dragon could choose to bestow its allies or subordinates with such a servant if they had the ability to create it.\n\nIn addition to the {{SI|10|lbs.|k}} of scales, the ritual also required fresh meat to be included in an [[iron]] cauldron in order to be conducted. After several days, the ritual yielded an egg approximately the size of a [[halfling]], which hatched within hours. The new guard drake bonded with whoever fed it first and reached maturity within three weeks."
