'''Dreels''', or '''trollfingers''', were river [[eel]]-like [[fish]] native to the [[River Reaching]], particularly the area of the river between the [[Misty Stair]] waterfalls and [[Skull Gorge]].

==Description==
Somewhere between green and black in color, dreels were relatively short and stocky.

==Ecology==
Dreels subsisted on algae and carrion, which helped keep the river clean. They felt quite at home in the icy waters of the River Reaching.

==As food==
In spite of their mucus-like taste, dreels were quite nourishing. Their taste improved considerably if served properly, for example fried or [[Pickle|pickled]] with [[herbs]] and [[spices]].

In the 1490s DR, the [[Cutlass (inn)|Cutlass]] inn in [[Luskan]] advertised a "breakfast special" consisting of [[brandy]] and dreels.
