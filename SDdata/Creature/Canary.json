        "mainbody": "canary () was a species of bright yellow bird found in Faerûn that was notable for its song-like chirping.\nDuathamper canary A species of canary endemic to Cormanthor, typically found nesting in butternut trees along the River Duathamper. They had yellow feathers and a green throat. They were notable for being regarded as Rillifane Rallathils favorite creature, according to Makk Fireseed and the elves of the Tangled Trees. They believed the canarys yellow feathers were symbolic of the sun, and that its green throat represented the leaves of trees.\nCanaries were a favored form of familiar or pet among shield dwarves.\nMany dwarven miners of northern Faerûn, such as those of Earthfast, took caged canaries with them into the mines. If the air turned bad, then the canary died first. They adopted this practice as a certain glowing fungus, which changed color in bad air and was used by southern dwarves, tended to die in cold northern climates.\nIronlord Torg mac Cei of Earthfast developed a liking for them, and kept several as pets. He often carried a fine golden cage about with him, even on campaign and in battle.\n* The god Geb was known to sometimes manifest as a dead canary when miners were about to uncover pockets of lethal gas."
