            "Duathamper canary": "A species of canary endemic to [[Cormanthor]], typically found nesting in [[butternut (tree)|butternut trees]] along the [[Duathamper|River Duathamper]]. They had yellow feathers and a green throat. They were notable for being regarded as [[Rillifane Rallathil]]'s favorite creature, according to [[Makk Fireseed]] and the [[elves]] of the [[Tangled Trees]]. They believed the canary's yellow feathers were symbolic of [[the sun]], and that its green throat represented the leaves of trees.<ref>"
        },
        "Usages": "Canaries were a favored form of [[familiar]] or pet among [[shield dwarves]].<ref>\n\nMany [[dwarf|dwarven]] miners of northern Faerûn, such as those of [[Earthfast]], took caged canaries with them into the mines. If the air turned bad, then the canary died first. They adopted this practice as a certain glowing [[fungus]], which changed color in bad air and was used by southern dwarves, tended to die in cold northern climates.\n\n[[Ironlord]] [[Torg mac Cei]] of Earthfast developed a liking for them, and kept several as pets. He often carried a fine golden cage about with him, even on campaign and in battle.",
        "Trivia": "* The god [[Geb]] was known to sometimes manifest as a dead canary when miners were about to uncover pockets of lethal gas."
