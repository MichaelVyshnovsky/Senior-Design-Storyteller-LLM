        "Description": "Nagahydras were serpentine creatures approximately {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} long and weighing about {{SI|2000|lb|k|long=yes}}. The scales could be of many different colors, including black, deep purple, emerald green, green-gold, bright crimson, and silver. Nagahydras had five necks and vaguely humanoid heads. Bright red and orange spikes ran down the spine.\n<!--==Personality==-->",
        "Abilities": "Nagahydras could regenerate cut-off heads unless fire or [[acid]] was applied to the stump. Nagahydras were known to have venomous fangs.\n\nNagahydras were accomplished sorcerers, capable of casting spells of up to mid-to-high tier; they could also utilize spells that were typically considered to be restricted to [[cleric]]s, particularly spells of the [[Destruction domain|Destruction]] and [[Scalykind domain|Scalykind]] domains.",
        "Combat": "Nagahydras attacked with the venomous fangs and many spells.",
        "Society": "Nagahydras normally dwelled in temperate forests, and in [[Faer√ªn]] were recorded to live in the jungles of [[Chult]], the [[Mhair Jungles]], and in the [[Qurth Forest]].\n\nNagahydras typically spoke [[Common]] and at least one other language, such as [[Celestial language|Celestial]], [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]], or [[Infernal language|Infernal]].",
        "History": "Nagahydras came into existence after the fall of [[Mhairshaulk]] and the diversification of the major naga subspecies. They specifically were created when some [[water naga]]s tried to reverse said diversification.<ref>"
