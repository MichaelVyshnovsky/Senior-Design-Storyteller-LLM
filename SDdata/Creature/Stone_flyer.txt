Stone flyers were magical beasts which hunted prey deep in the Underdark.
These creatures looked like wolves with large wings. Most stone flyers were earth tones, such as black, brown, or gray. 
Stone flyers moved through stone as if it was air and attacked victims with surprise. These earth elemental beasts worked in packs while hunting for prey.
