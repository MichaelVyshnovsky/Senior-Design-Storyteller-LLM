The '''reverse centaur''' was a creature that lived in [[Neverwinter Wood]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
A reverse centaur had the upper body of a [[horse]] and the lower body of a [[human]]. This made it different from regular [[centaur]]s, which had the upper body of the latter.

==Combat==
The only observed reverse centaur used stealth before engaging in combat. It attacked by kicking and performing a flurry of hoof attacks.

==Ecology==
The only observed reverse centaur was found in a forest. It stalked Neverwinter Wood alone and attacked individuals that came too close. It was wearing clothing, including a buttoned shirt.
