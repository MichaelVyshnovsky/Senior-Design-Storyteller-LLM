They fought with either a greatsword or a dagger and a longsword. Their combat tactics were straightforward, wading right into enemy forces, but did well with collaborating with others of their kind on attacks.\nThese angels acted as the foot soldiers of deities, following the commands of more powerful angels, and some clerics.\nSome deities would send one of these angels to reward devout worshipers that had done something to please them. This reward could be a magic item or even the service of the angel itself for a period of ten days.\nIn 1479 DR,The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be 1479 DR for the purposes of this wiki. a group of adventurers fleeing from Caer Westphal were ambushed by a group of angels wielding swords of black flame and wearing black tabards, emblazoned with the unholy symbol of Cyric.
