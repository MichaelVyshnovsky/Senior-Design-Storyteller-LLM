        "mainbody": "Gibbering orbs were powerful floating aberrations that were theorized to be a common ancestor of gibbering mouthers and beholders.\nThese huge orbs of at least  in diameter were pulsating masses of grayish flesh and hundreds of mouths and eyes of various sizes and shapes that moved, shifted, and swirled throughout the creatures body. The eyes blinked as they swirled around the orb, and mouths screamed, drooled, and mumbled strange alien devotions. These creatures constricted and spasmed chaotically as if something was trapped inside the blobs, constantly trying to break out and escape as they floated above ground.\nDespite their chaotic, maddening appearance and incessant chanting, gibbering orbs were supremely intelligent beings. Some believed that the gibbering orbs functioned akin to a hive intelligent of several beings within one swirling aberrant body. They spoke all languages, and, in fact, each mouth spoke its own language, producing a maddening cacophony of voices that was sure to shatter any listeners mind. Even if gibbering orbs appeared incoherent, mad, and insane, the creatures were perversely rational. They had their own secret goals and objectives.\nAll living creatures were gibbering orbs targets. The creatures attacked relentlessly with their eye rays, trying to consume the prey with their many mouths and absorb any magical knowledge and treasure they might have.\nGibbering orbs entire bodies were covered in moving eyes, giving them all-around vision as well as darkvision. Their bodies were buoyant and could fly but could never fall to the ground, slowly descending as if under the effects of the feather fall spell.\nThe creatures cacophonous gibbering could drive anyone mad within , similarly to the effects of the insanity spell.\nGibbering orbs had two dozen eyes that could release spell rays at their enemies. All of these spells were on par with magics unleashed by the most powerful wizards and had the range of . In battle, gibbering orbs could only target a single creature with five rays. The gibbering orb rays included cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of death, flesh to stone, greater dispelling, harm, hold monster, Abi-Dalzims horrid wilting, implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic missile, Mordenkainens disjunction, Ottos irresistible dance, polymorph any object, power word, blind, power word, kill, power word, stun, prismatic spray, slay living, and temporal stasis.\nWhen in battle, gibbering orbs extended pseudopods that ended with maws at lightning speeds to land devastating biting attacks on their prey. A single orb could extend four of such pseudopods at a single target and twelve pseudopods total within the timeframe of six seconds. To make the creatures even more terrifying – their eyes, similarly to beholders, could dispense a variety of deadly spells.\nAny creature grabbed by a gibbering orbs pseudopods faced the danger of being swallowed whole. Gibbering orbs would consume any creature smaller than them. Once inside, the prey began being dissolved by the acid. However, they had a chance of cutting their way out. Those who failed to escape from the gibbering orbs ever-changing bodies were dissolved and consumed. If they had any spells prepared or memorized, the gibbering orb gained those spells to be cast freely. They could release such consumed spells at the rate of two per six seconds from the eyes. These consumed spells, if left unused, disappeared 24 hours later.\nGibbering orbs were exceedingly rare solitary creatures that traveled between planes of existence, hunting for living creatures to kill and consume in their insatiable hunger. Very few who encountered these creatures lived long enough to tell the tale. The orbs originated from the Far Realm.\nIn the late 15 century DR, a gibbering orb was said to inhabit The Phelhelra, a fortress in Calimshan on the foothills of the Marching Mountains. The creature could be found in the deepest chambers – avoided by miners and adventurers alike. The origin of the gibbering orb was unknown. However, sages suggested that the monster slithered through a gate or some translocation magic."
