        "mainbody": "'''Vapor rats''' were a creature that resembled gray-furred [[giant rat]]s, but were connected to the element of [[air]].",
        "Biology": "In their normal, physical state vapor rats were very fast. They were also adept at swimming and could rapidly burrow through loose soil.",
        "Abilities": "Vapor rats were able to alter their physiology, transforming into a gaseous form that resembled the wisps of a cloud or similar vapors. In this state they were able to steer their bodies through wind, granting them a form of flight.\n\nThese creatures always assumed this gaseous form whenever they felt seriously threatened or were injured. When in this form they could only be harmed by means of [[magic]]al [[fire]] or lightning, as well as exceptionally strong winds.\n\nWhenever a vapor rat was killed or seriously wounded a small cloud of noxious fumes would emanate from their bodies, similar to the [[spell]] ''[[stinking cloud]]''. They always directed the release of this gas, having it affect a particular target. Beyond {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} this gas dissipated.",
        "Combat": "Vapor rats typically attacked other creatures with their sharp teeth whenever they were angry, hungry, or cornered.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Vapor rats were an omnivorous species. They equally loved to feast upon trash and carrion.",
            "Habitats": "In [[Faerun]] they could be found in the [[Daggerdale]] region and some of the medium woodlands of [[Cormanthor]], including the [[Border Forest]] and [[Vale of Lost Voices]]. They also inhabited the clouds upon which [[cloud giant]] castles rested as well as clouds inhabited by [[cloud dragon]]s. Beyond [[Toril]], they could be found on the planet [[Oerth]].\n\nOutside of the [[Prime Material plane]], vapor rats could be found in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Steam]],",
            "Relationships": "[[Smoke mephit]]s often kept vapor rats as pets, prizing them as many creatures would a [[cat]].",
            "Usage": "The bottled dust of three vapor rats could be used as an alternative ingredient in crafting a ''[[potion of gaseous form]]''.{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|40}} The blood of a vapor rat could mixed with the blood of a [[green dragon]] in a broth to [[item enchantment|enchant]] its [[dragon's tooth|tooth]]."
