A '''carp''' was a type of fish found on [[Toril]].

==Species==
===Giant Golden Carp===
Giant golden carp were found in [[Scalewater]], a pond south of the Thunder Peaks. A [[red dragon]] guarded this pond.

===Koi===
Koi were multicolored carp found in [[Kara-Tur]]. Considered sacred, they were kept in pools at [[M'tsin Gompa]] in [[Tabot]] and in scenic ponds in [[Cham Fau]] in [[Shou Lung]].

==Habitats==
Carp were commonly fished out of the [[Akanamere]] by fishermen from the [[Blade Kingdoms]] and the city-state of [[Lomatra]]. Carps were used to create [[salt fish]] and left to dry in the sun, strung up on long strings.

==History==
In [[1367 DR]], a sage in [[Thunderstone]] received from an explorer a deceased giant golden carp from Scalewater. Examining it, this sage found the carp had died of a gill rot sickness and estimated that all the carp in the pond would die by year's end. The sage feared the dragon would then retaliate against nearby villages. However, the disease could be treated with an antidote brewed from the shells of popper [[shrimp]].
