        "mainbody": "'''Cloud rays''' were a species of gargantuan, [[manta ray]]-shaped [[magical beast]]s of primeval origins, with a connection to [[earth (element)|earth]], that flew through the skies of the desert world of [[Athas]].",
        "Description": "These creatures had broad, flattened, and triangular bodies with long pectoral fins on each side. A bulge ran the length of their spine, with it and the abdomen tapering off into a long, thin, [[whip]]-like tail. This appendage, referred to as the \"zip\", was quite agile and compromised of very sharp, barbed ridges that grew at the tip of the creature's spine. They had four eyes of jet black hue, one on each side of their snout and cranial bulge, and were guarded from harm by sets of ridges.\n\nTheir bodies were enormous in scope,In ''Monstrous Compendium - Dark Sun'', it is stated that cloud rays can swallow whole anything smaller than size \"huge\", while in ''Monstrous Compendium II'' for 3{{rd}} edition it is stated they can swallow a creature that is \"Huge or smaller\". In 2{{nd}} edition, size \"huge\" creatures were classified as anything within the range of {{SIrange|12|25|ft|long=yes}}, while in 3{{rd}} and 3.5 a size \"huge\" creature was classified as anything between {{SIrange|16|32|ft|long=yes}}. and emptied all food directly into the creature's intestines. Lacking any appreciable true stomach, their interior jaw ridges and long throats were lined with teeth designed for vigorously grinding and tearing its food down to a near liquid consistency. \n\nThe colors of these vast creatures were mottled in shades of either speckled-brown, dark blue, or gray. Their undersides displayed similar, though lighter shades of those colors, usually being a drab olive and white. Juvenile cloud rays by contrast had a translucent quality to their skin and were relatively fragile.",
        "Behavior": "Cloud rays were generally docile unless disturbed, most often attacking simply due to hunger. In particular, attempting to contact cloud rays psionically would throw them into a horrible rage, driving them to madly pursue the devour the psionicist responsible. Though they would go to great lengths to capture the offender, they would never resort to landing.\n\nCloud rays were also a territorial species. They respected the \"air space\" of one another and, with few exceptions, would not intrude upon the territory of another cloud ray.",
        "Abilities": "Cloud rays were an innately psionic species. They possessed the [[discipline]] of [[psychometabolism]], having under it the psionic science ofTo different degrees, these psionic abilities are retained in the 3{{rd}} edition iteration of cloud rays. It is detailed in ''Monster Manual II'' as having innate ''levitation'' and ''telekinesis'' abilities, similar to the [[spell]]s of the same name, whilst ''inertial barrier'' is simplified down to an innate ability that functions like the spell ''[[protection from arrows]]''. \n\nThey were capable of a sort of \"flight\", by means of a combination of their innate [[psionic]] power of levitation and lighter-than-air gases they produced and manipulated inside of their bodies. Their bodies were further propelled and maneuvered by flapping their enormous pectoral fins.\n\nCloud rays also possessed a single power under the psionic discipline [[psychoportation]] known as ''[[dream travel]]''. Cloud rays sometimes tapped into this power while digesting a good meal or sleeping, though would more consciously utilize it when injured.",
        "Combat": "The enormous stature of cloud rays posed a great threat to the people of Athas even when the creatures were not outwardly trying to harm, as the flapping of their pectoral fins could kick up sand like a deadly sandstorm and decimate entire villages in their wake.\n\nWhen hunting for prey, cloud rays typically resorted straight to snatching up and swallowing their prey whole. On some occasions they might drop snatch prey to the ground from high in the sky in an effort to soften them up. It was whenever this \"swallow whole\" maneuver failed that a cloud ray would attempt to get as close as possible to a prey and strike with their tail in a whip-like fashion, then if possible turn themselves around to follow that attack up with a bite. This tail lash happened at an incredible speed, producing a thunderous clap in the process. And just a few strikes of their tail was powerful enough to destroy most structures.\n\nCloud ray pups primarily fought by flitting around their prey and repeatedly stinging them with their tail.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Cloud rays subsisted primarily upon a mixture of [[magic]]al, psychic, and [[entropic energy|entropic]] energies. This was supplemented by a carnivorous, with the amount of physical sustenance needed becoming less as they grew older. They preferred to prey upon other flying creatures, typically being fond of [[roc]]s and flying [[humanoid]]s.",
            "Languages": "Being creatures of an animal intellect, cloud rays lacked a sophisticated language of their own, though they did have a complex system of signalling to one another that utilized their tail.",
            "Usages": "If by some means a cloud ray was ever successfully slain, its enormous body could provide two to three months worth of raw materials and meat to a settlement."
        },
        "History": "In The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[portal|gate]]'' to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers. A young [[thri-kreen]] named [[Ka'cha]] was among creatures captured by the elves, and he lamented being separated from his clutch.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|9}} Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|13}}\n\nAfter two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, Chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large [[erdlu]] [[egg]]s and two ''[[potion fruit|apples of healing]]''. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination&ndash;the [[Ringing Forest]]&ndash;the way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|14}}\n\nWhile traveling to the forest through a path in the [[Ringing Mountains]], the Malatran heroes found themselves under attack by a particularly hungry cloud ray.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|20-21}}"
