Angels of protection were a variety of angels devoted to the role of guardian or caretaker for important individuals or places.
These angels radiated an angelic aura of protection around them that made it more difficult to harm them or their designated ward, as well as more difficult to move around the area.
An angel of protection was typically outfitted in plate mail and a greatsword.
In the late 15 century DR, a few adventurers in the Sword Coast were seen to be accompanied by an angel of protection.
The life of an angel of protection was devoted to acting as a guardian of individual designated by the deity they served or by a powerful servitor that had managed to summon it. Besides individuals, they were known to serve as guardians of temples or other sites sacred to the deity they served.
These angels were sometimes found fighting in the company of angels of battle and angels of valor. Those guarding a site were likely to be found fighting alongside an eidolon.
