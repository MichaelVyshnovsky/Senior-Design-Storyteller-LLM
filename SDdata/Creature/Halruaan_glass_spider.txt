'''Halruaan glass spiders'''<ref group="note">The novel does not name the species, this page is using a simple descriptor name devised from the creature's appearance. were a species of tiny harmless [[spider]]s, unique to the nation of [[Halruaa]] in [[South Faerûn]].

==Description==
These tiny arachnids were translucent as if made of glass with a gentle rosy hue that gleamed from within their bodies.

==Ecology==
Halruaan glass spiders weaved red [[spidersilk]] webs. These creatures were prized by Halruaan [[mage]]s as they were used as [[spell component]]s. Unique to Halruaaa, the spiders lived in its tropical warm, and humid climate, often nesting on the sprawling massive [[bilboa]] [[tree]]s. The size of these trees was big enough to support its own micro-ecosystems that included several types of spiders, including Halruaan glass, brightly-colored [[bird]]s, [[tressym]]s, and [[starsnake]]s.
