An '''executioner's hood''' was a rare, strange species of creature that resembled the hood of an executioner.

==Description==
These creatures were a dull black shade and while in their hood form they measured around {{SIrange|1|3|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. This hood form had two eye holes which could be looked into or out from. Their bodies overall were {{SI|1|in}} thick and could flatten out into a disc shape.

==Abilities==
These creatures were immune to any form of [[sleep]]-inducing [[spell]]. When wrapped around a victim, any spell effect cast upon them would be shared with their victim.

==Behavior==
These creatures were semi-intelligent.

==Combat==
[[File:Executioner hood attacks.png|thumb|253px|''A halpless adventurer falls victim to an executioner's hood.'']]
An executioner's hood hunted in a similar manner to a [[lurker]]. They crawled and hid within ceiling niches and waited for prey to pass by. They would then fall upon their victim and fasten themselves around their head. The executioner's hood then proceeded to gradually strangle and suffocate their victim.

This creature could not be removed from its victim unless either one of them were killed. They could be made to release their hold on a victim by inducing a state of intoxication. This was done by pouring a full quart of hard liquor onto them.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], these creatures could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].
