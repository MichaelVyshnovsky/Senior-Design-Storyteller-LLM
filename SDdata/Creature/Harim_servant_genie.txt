'''Harim servant genies''' were special [[tasked genie]]s in [[Zakhara]] who guarded harims and entertained the brides and concubines of elite citizenry.

These [[genie]]s preferred to work for mortals, where they could feel superior and important, but they also worked for other genies performing more menial tasks.

Harim servant genies originated as servants of the [[jann]], working in their harims for so long that they lost the drive to perform any other functions. [[Noble genie]]s who possessed harim servant genies were viewed in high status by their peers. 

==Description==
Most harim servants were males who possessed tall muscular physiques, though they were usually not attractive in the face.

==Combat==
Harim servants had access to a variety of spells, most of which were used to entertain and serve. They typically carried a pair of [[great scimitar]]s, wielding one in each hand with ease because of their size.

==Habitat/Society==
Male harim servants adopted a fatherly role toward their charges, seeking to guide and protect them. Female harim servants brought a strong sense of order to their duty. All harim servants were quick to punish those who were out of line, though they promoted a sense of family whenever they could.

Harim servants performed a wide variety of tasks for their charges and the harim in general. They were happy with doing a good job and earning the adoration of the women of the harim. Harim servants who were mistreated or bound by their master usually became attached to the masterâ€™s women, keeping secrets and acting as a confidant.

==Ecology==
Harim servants had good relationships with most mortal races, particularly the women of those races. Because of the nature of their duties, harim servants were usually able to empathize with women they met outside of the harim.

These genies would go insane if either their harim was taken from them or it was destroyed. Both caused intense feelings of failure. Insane harim servants often became [[slayer genie]]s.
