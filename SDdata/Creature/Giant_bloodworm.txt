'''Giant bloodworms''' were large sanguivores that resembled a giant earthworm.

==Description==
Giant bloodworms had spotted dark green, slimy skin and a dark brown underbelly. They typically measured {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in length. In the dimlight of their underground habitats, they could often be mistaken by other creatures for a moss-covered boulder.

==Biology==
Giant bloodworms propelled their bodies along the ground of their watery habitats, being incapable of swimming.

They were particularly vulnerable to fire.

==Combat==
If hungry or provoked, a giant bloodworm attacked by attempting to affix its mouth to a target. Once attached the worm would continue to suck blood from its victim until it was satiated, the victim died, or it was dislodged.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], giant bloodworms could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Giant bloodworms were a sanguivorous species.
===Habitats===
Giant bloodworms were typically known to inhabit shallow pools of water within underground or caverns.
