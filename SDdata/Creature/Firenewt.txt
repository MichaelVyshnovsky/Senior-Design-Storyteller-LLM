Firenewts were about the size of a slim human. They appeared like lizardfolk with simpler faces and larger, inky-black or deep crimson eyes. Their speckled, smooth-scaled skin appeared eel-like and was colored dark reddish brown at their spines and faded to nearly white on their front sides. Their young were lighter in color, but darkened progressively as they matured. They had long feet, giving them the appearance of "reversed knees", which gave them an advantage while running or leaping.
Firenewts were known for being extreme sadists, with an extreme penchant for treachery, as well as cruel marauders. They delighted in torturing virtually every creature, especially sentient ones.
These creatures were highly resistant to harm from fire and could even breathe small bouts of it out to a range of . However, they were vulnerable to extremely low temperatures and cold-based spells.
Firenewts had no particular talent for arcane magic, thus they never became sorcerers or wizards. Priests within firenewt society were typically capable of casting the spells animal friendship, faerie fire, predict weather, produce flame, heat metal, and pyrotechnics. Priests of Kossuth uniquely had the spells erupt, lava missile, and lava splash.
Warlocks of Imix had access to the spells burning hands, fire bolt, flaming sphere, hellish rebuke, guidance, light, mage hand, prestidigitation, and scorching ray.

Besides other firenewts, these creatures typically concentrated their raids against other humanoids. Such as goblins, orcs, and other mountain-dwellers. In Anauroch, firenewts were a constant source of harassment for Bedine tribes. Firenewts viewed most other creatures as little more than food and thus were not often found living among them. Though if a tribe was ever slaughtered, the survivors would often join nearby mercenary groups.
They kept some creatures as slaves if they were deemed fit for mining or other chores around a lair, they were kept as slaves. If they were not deemed fit for performing such things were ritually sacrificed.
Giant striders were the only form of domesticated mount within firenewt society. Their hides were used for leathermaking and their bones were made into tools, for such things as saddles and signal horns respectively, while their tendons and ligaments were used to make saddle bindings.
Besides giant striders, firenewts domesticated fire lizards and used them to guard the hatching grounds of their lairs.
They sometimes acted as servants of, or were enslaved by, efreeti.
The blood of a firenewt could be mixed with the blood of a red dragon in a broth to enchant its tooth.
One rumor claimed that several firenewts in the Peaks of Flame turned their backs on their tribes and were then taken in by a couatl.
How firenewts came to acquire their races primary form of mounts, the giant striders, was a matter of some speculation. Some among them believed they were a gift bestowed upon them by Imix because they were able to breath fire.
According to another legend, the red dragon Imvaernarhro was in search of fire-based creatures to serve him when he came upon the firenewt colony of the Peaks of Flame. In return for a large band of them, he offered the firenewts an immense pile of gold with which they could use to recast their statue of the deity Kossuth. But having looked upon knights and recognized how valuable mounts were to them in combat, the firenewts countered &mdash in return for some beast they could ride and breed, they would give him fifty of their warriors. Imvaernarhro agreed to their terms and returned six months later with an immense bag, filled with giant strider eggs, and after quickly discovering their usefulness the firenewts honored their agreement.
