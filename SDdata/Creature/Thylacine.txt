Thylacines, also known as jumping tigers and mantigers, were a species of intelligent feline.
Thylacines physically resembled a tiger. They had grey fur with patches of various colors. They had very sharp teeth and claws.
Thylacines were clever predators. It attacked by launching itself onto prey. Their claws and teeth delivered tremendous damage. Their bite was incredibly strong and only the strongest prey was able to break free.
Thylacines were excellent jumpers. Their powerful muscles allowed them to jump  straight up and  ahead of them. With a running start, they could clear . Their agility meant they received little damage when falling from any height. The fur coloring of a thylacine provided them with excellent camouflage. 
Some thylacines had the natural ability to cast an illusion upon themselves, once per day. This illusion allowed the thylacine to temporarily appear as a human. This ability was primarily used to shake off a pursuing humanoid hunter or to stealthily approach humanoid targets.
Thylacines were immune to any charm and fear-based spells as well as any other spell that controlled or influenced the mind.
Thylacines lived in thick forests, hills and mountains. They hunted an area up to  around their territory, avoiding any roads or settlements. They made their lairs within caves, ruins, or thick bushes.
Thylacines were carnivorous and solitary creatures. They hunted various prey, including herd animals, smaller predators and humanoids. They targeted solitary creatures or small groups. They were particularly wary of wizards. 
Every twelve years, thylacines were overcome with an instinctual urge to seek out another thylacine of the opposite sex to mate. Their mating urge brought them to remote forests and colder regions. Once there, they gathered in prides of up to forty individuals. They remained as a group for several months. After mating, the males departed while the now-pregnant females remained together. 
After a gestation period of six months, each female had a litter of up to three cubs. The pride stayed together for the next three years, until all the cubs matured. Afterwards, each thylacine returns to a life of solitude.
Thylacines served Baravar Cloakshadow and Rillifane Rallathil. Thylacines occasionally became allies with other felines, both natural and sentient, usually to tackle a shared problem. They sometimes shared their territory with weretigers. Thylacines despised all canine or lupine creatures.
The fur of a thylacine was used to make camouflage cloaks. Its brain was used as part of the magical ink that was used to write the mind blank spell, and was worth up to 50 gp.
