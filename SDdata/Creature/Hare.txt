Hares were a species of small, gentle herbivorous mammals that lived in burrows. They were distantly related to the similarly looking rabbit, though were larger in size.
Hares had a tendency to be skittish, though those that were familiars were far braver.
Hares had a keen sense of both hearing and smelling. They were also known to be swift runners and jumpers.
When confronted with danger a hare would often try to dash away or hide.
The existence of hares on Toril dated back to the days of Netheril. In that era of history, the citizens of Ythryn were known to keep them as pets, often splicing them with wings.
At some point following the fall of Netheril, a sorceress known as the Weeping Witch used grimoires from that civilization to transform hares and foxes into monstrous beasts under her command.
