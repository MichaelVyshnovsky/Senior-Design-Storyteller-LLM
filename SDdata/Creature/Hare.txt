'''Hares''' were a species of small, gentle herbivorous mammals that lived in burrows. They were distantly related to the similarly looking [[rabbit]], though were larger in size.

==Behavior==
Hares had a tendency to be skittish, though those that were [[familiar]]s were far braver.

==Abilities==
Hares had a keen sense of both hearing and smelling. They were also known to be swift runners and jumpers.

==Combat==
When confronted with danger a hare would often try to dash away or hide.

==History==
The existence of hares on [[Toril]] dated back to the days of [[Netheril]]. In that era of history, the citizens of [[Ythryn]] were known to keep them as pets, often splicing them with wings.

At some point following the fall of Netheril, a [[sorceress]] known as the [[Weeping Witch]] used [[grimoires]] from that civilization to transform hares and [[fox]]es into monstrous beasts under her command.
