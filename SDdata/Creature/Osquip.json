        "mainbody": "An '''osquip''' was an aggressive, multi-legged rodent about the size of a small dog.",
        "Description": "They were hairless, with huge heads and large teeth. Most had six legs, a few had eight, and even fewer had ten. Their tails were not uniform either. They varied between no tail at all, to a stump, to a [[rat]] tail's length. Some claimed that their teeth were sharp enough to dig through stone.",
        "Behavior": "While rats normally fled anything larger than themselves, osquips proved to be both territorial and willing to attack trespassers fearlessly and ferociously. If a party entered an area where osquips made their home, the creatures emerged quickly, and a typical swarm was very damaging.\n\nUnlike rats, osquips were not afraid of [[fire]].\n\nOsquips had no understanding of value but collected shiny things from time to time.",
        "Combat": "Osquips used their aforementioned teeth to fight. They had a developed sense of scent and could pinpoint creatures within 5 feet (1.5 meters) and had a general sense of direction of creatures within 30 feet (9.1 meters).",
        "Ecology": {
            "Relationships": "On [[Toril]], osquips were sometimes used as [[familiar]]s."
