        "mainbody": "'''Spider cactus''' was a species of carnivorous cacti that fed on creatures unlucky enough to pass close to seemingly harmless desert plants.",
        "Description": "Spider cacti appeared almost indistinguishable from regular bright green [[barrel cactus]], {{SI|2'|'\"|long=yes}} to {{SI|3'|'\"|long=yes}} across and {{SI|6'|'\"|long=yes}} to {{SI|7'|'\"|long=yes}} in length. Like ordinary cacti, these plants were covered in sharp needles of green and purple and had white streaks that ran along ridges on their bodies. However, unlike other cacti, spider cacti fired their feeding needles in order to capture and feed on various creatures. The only clue of the plants' deadly nature were discarded and dissipated husks found nearby.",
        "Behavior": "These plants stayed motionless until prey ventured within their feeding needles' range of {{SI|15'|'\"|long=yes}}. Spider cacti could feel any creatures within range with liquids in their bodies. These miniature missiles were tethered to the plant. Once needles punctured the prey's hide, a slow-acting paralytic agent was released, leaving the prey unmoving as a spider cactus reeled them in, slowly feeding until the prey was nothing but a lifeless, dry husk.\n\nEach needle spray consisted of five to eight barbed purple projectiles that carried paralytic poison and between three and eighteen bigger green tethered feeding needles. Spider cacti always concentrated their needle shots on a single creature, firing purple needles first and sending feeding needs out once the prey succumbed to paralysis. Once captured, it took up to three minutes for the cactus to reel its prey in. The plants could only launch the feeding needles out once per day, and if damaged or severed, needles regrew back slowly, only three in a single week. Feeding needle tethers were extremely strong.",
        "Ecology": "Spider cacti generally could be found in patches of two to eight individual plants, often grown alongside roads. These plants acted on instinct and were blindly competitive, then ensnaring prey. Several cacti could attempt to pull a victim towards themselves, and the cactus with the most feeding needles attached to the victim won the competition.\n\nDuring rain seasons, spider cacti bloomed and released thousands of eight-fronded seeds. The first seed to touch soil was the only one to survive as it momentarily sprouted and quickly drained all water from the ground and air around it, leaving other seeds to die without nutrition. Each rainstorm caused one additional plant to be planted and the adolescent cats grew swiftly {{SI|1'|'\"|long=yes}} per month.\n\nIf an industrious traveler managed to remove all the needles from a spider cactus, they could open the plant up to collect precious liquid inside. The liquid inside of these plants was sweet and thick like [[honey]]. Each adult cactus held a full gallon of the sweet and extremely nutritious liquid.",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Spellplague]], spider cacti were only found on the desert world of [[Athas]]. In The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[portal|gate]]'' to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers. A young [[Athasian thri-kreen]] named [[Ka'cha]] was among creatures captured by the elves, and he lamented being separated from his clutch.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|9}} Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|13}}\n\nAfter two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large [[erdlu]] [[egg]]s (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two ''[[potion fruit|apples of healing]]''. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination—the [[Ringing Forest]]—the way back to [[Toril]]. Finally, before the heroes left they were told of a patch of spider cacti that was a day's walk north of them, instructing how they could extract liquid from them and warning that their barbs were so sharp they could pierce even a thri-kreen's carapace. When the Malatran heroes finally came across the spider cacti patch at the head of a valley they wondered why it was so named, as to their eyes the plant didn't resemble a [[spider]] in any way.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|14}}\n\nWith the transposition of [[Laerakond]] to [[Toril]] following the Spellplague, spider cacti could be found growing on that continent in the areas outside of its port-city [[Tarmalune]]. They were affected by creatures from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] brought forth by the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]], who sought to awaken the sleeping [[Dawn Titan]] named [[Achazar]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|10}}"
