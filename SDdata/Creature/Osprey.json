        "mainbody": "Ospreys were a species of beautifully colored sea eagles whose eggs were considered a delicacy and their nests often destroyed because of that.\nOspreys were majestic coastal birds of prey who consumed fish and small lizards and mammals without discrimination. They had very distinctly colored feathers. Their black beaks and yellow eyes were highlighted by dark brown stripes on white, their back and wings were brown, and their chests and legs were white.\nSome aquatic rangers kept ospreys as animal companions.\nOspreys were one of the species of predatory birds that the Northmen of Gundarlun were known to depict on the figureheads of their longships."
