        "mainbody": "A '''frenzy dog''' was a magical transformation of almost any other animal, created by the special ''[[create frenzy dog]]'' [[spell]] used by the [[druid]]s of the [[Chondalwood]] to protect their environment. The spell that created these creatures was barely known outside this forest, and the druids used it sparingly, creating a pack of only around a dozen frenzy dogs at one time, wary of their ability to ruin forest environments if left unchecked. A frenzy dog gained a certain amount of magical intelligence, but only enough for hunting.",
        "Description": "The frenzy dog was around {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder and had a black coat with tan and white swirls. It had a face similar to a [[Wikipedia:pit bull|pit bull]]. It had a protrusion of {{SI|7|in|long=yes}} bony spikes from its neck that had the appearance of a spiked [[collar (animal)|collar]].",
        "Diet": "A frenzy dog ate three times the amount that a normal [[dog]] of the same size would eat. They would eat any type of animal flesh.",
        "Combat": "In combat, the frenzy dog attacked without fear and attempted to rip its victims apart (although not necessarily to eat). It had the ability to go into a rage which would grant immunity against a druid's empathy with wild animals or an animal handler's skills. It could trip [[humanoid]]s and other bipeds, and it was hard to grapple because of the spikes around its neck."
