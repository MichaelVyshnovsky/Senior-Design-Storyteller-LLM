They occasionally infiltrated sea elf societies, usually for nefarious purposes.\n\nThe word \"malenti\" meant \"changeling\" in the elvish dialect. In sahuagin, its literal meaning was \"ugly one\"—a term sahuagin used among themselves and not directly to a malenti.",
        "Description": "Malenti were sahuagin mutants, but they most closely resembled [[aquatic elf|aquatic elves]] in form and appearance. They had greenish-silver skin and green or deep blue hair, with slanted, sparkling green eyes. They had webbed fingers and toes, as well as the gills of most marine species. Unlike aquatic elves, however, they had retractable claws and sharper teeth, as well as skin as tough as normal sahuagin's.\n\nTheir similarity to sea elves was enough that even true sea elves could not distinguish the difference; however, [[dolphin]]s were sometimes able to tell them apart, and malenti greatly disliked dolphins because of this.",
        "Personality": "{{Sectstub}}",
        "Abilities": "{{Sectstub}}",
        "Combat": "{{Sectstub}}",
        "Society": "Malenti were shunned by their clan as whole, but were protected by the clan's ruler and trained as spies by the clans best warriors and the priestesses. Some developed the ability to detect sea elves up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} away, which made them even more useful.\n\nA clan's blacksmiths were often malenti since they could tolerate the open air and fire necessary to operate a forge better than other sahuagin.\n\nIronically malenti could not mate with sea elves, but could mate with a sahuagin, if one would have them, or another malenti. The offspring was always another malenti. A sahuagin who did mate with a malenti often killed off the mutant hatchlings if it could.\n\nIf a malenti discovered its true status among sahuagin society, it sometimes left its clan. Malenti reaching the end of their lifespans also tended to flee their clan as their usefulness waned. As a result, whole communities of malenti have been known to come into existence. These rogue clans were often sought out and eradicated by \"true\" sahuagin.",
        "Noble Malenti Society": {
            "Settlement": "The first colony known was [[Kymal]]. It is located above the [[Bymmal]] trench, close to [[Aglarond]] shores, and led by a citizen elected by popular vote. The Noble Malenti of this colony wanted it to be a place where every Malenti would be considered as equal to one another. This settlement is built as structures of [[giant clam]] shells.\n\nThe second location was in the [[Bay of Chessenta]] , into the elven settlement of [[Velyraar]]. The Noble Malenti clan helped the elves living there to defeat a slaughter started by a [[sahuagin]] attack. In return for their help, the [[sea elves]] tended to accept them to fight their common enemy.",
            "Religion": "The noble malenti have embraced new faiths, shifting away from [[Sekolah]]'s church to worship [[Deep Sashelas]], [[Eldath]] or [[Mystra]]. Those changes have been strongly supported by Kymal's leader in order to turn away from their devil origin and hopefully win wizardry abilities.\n\nIn the last part of the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] in [[1369 DR]], [[Laaqueel]] discovered that she had been blessed by [[Eldath]], not Sekolah, and it was Eldath's voice that had guided her choices."
        },
        "History": "The orgins of the malenti lay in the distant past, when a cabal of surface-dwelling mages tried to create a sea elf-sahuagin hybrid. Some of the sahuagin whom they experimented on escaped returned to their homes and bred, resulting in the malenti strain.",
