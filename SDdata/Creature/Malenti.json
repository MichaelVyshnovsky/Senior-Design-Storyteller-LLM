        "mainbody": "Malenti (\nMalenti were shunned by their clan as whole, but were protected by the clans ruler and trained as spies by the clans best warriors and the priestesses. Some developed the ability to detect sea elves up to  away, which made them even more useful.\nA clans blacksmiths were often malenti since they could tolerate the open air and fire necessary to operate a forge better than other sahuagin.\nIronically malenti could not mate with sea elves, but could mate with a sahuagin, if one would have them, or another malenti. The offspring was always another malenti. A sahuagin who did mate with a malenti often killed off the mutant hatchlings if it could.\nIf a malenti discovered its true status among sahuagin society, it sometimes left its clan. Malenti reaching the end of their lifespans also tended to flee their clan as their usefulness waned. As a result, whole communities of malenti have been known to come into existence. These rogue clans were often sought out and eradicated by \"true\" sahuagin.\nTwo of those rogue clans, gathering a total of 60 members, had built new cultures and colonies far from the original sahuagin society. As outcasts, they tend to be very discrete and reject the model of sahuagin society that is seen as savage. They are looking for a more harmonious way of life with other races, even by forging alliances. Doing so they would try hard to be accepted but would be ready to react against any aggression they might suffer. In order to be accepted by other races they can count on their ability to forge and work metal under the sea.\nThe first colony known was Kymal. It is located above the Bymmal trench, close to Aglarond shores, and led by a citizen elected by popular vote. The Noble Malenti of this colony wanted it to be a place where every Malenti would be considered as equal to one another. This settlement is built as structures of giant clam shells.\nThe second location was in the Bay of Chessenta , into the elven settlement of Velyraar. The Noble Malenti clan helped the elves living there to defeat a slaughter started by a sahuagin attack. In return for their help, the sea elves tended to accept them to fight their common enemy.\nThe noble malenti have embraced new faiths, shifting away from Sekolahs church to worship Deep Sashelas, Eldath or Mystra. Those changes have been strongly supported by Kymals leader in order to turn away from their devil origin and hopefully win wizardry abilities.\nIn the last part of the Twelfth Serôs War in 1369 DR, Laaqueel discovered that she had been blessed by Eldath, not Sekolah, and it was Eldaths voice that had guided her choices.\nThe orgins of the malenti lay in the distant past, when a cabal of surface-dwelling mages tried to create a sea elf-sahuagin hybrid. Some of the sahuagin whom they experimented on escaped returned to their homes and bred, resulting in the malenti strain.\n* Sittl, a malenti masquerading as a sea elf.\n* Laaqueel, a priestess who undertook a quest to search for Iakhovas. She succeeded and thereby inadvertently started the Twelfth Serôs War.\n* Qallit & Tekir, a pair of malenti from the Corsair Domains."
