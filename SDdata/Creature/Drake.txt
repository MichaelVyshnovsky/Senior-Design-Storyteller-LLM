They were often used as guards by dragons, or they were given to the dragons humanoid servants.

The felldrakes were created by Bahamut himself and carried his blood in their veins, making them fierce, loyal, and good at heart. They originated when a group of powerful elven wizards helped Bahamut turn back a demonic invasion, and were meant to guard the elves against future invasions.
