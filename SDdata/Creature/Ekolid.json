        "mainbody": "olids were insectoid in form, although closer observation revealed they were far worse than any typical pest, and exactly what kind of insect they were was unclear. They appeared as a terrifying fusion of [[ant]], [[spider]], and [[scorpion]], with three membranous wings on the thorax.\n\nDespite being {{SI|2|ft}} long and {{SI|45|lb|k}}, their structure helped them look much larger than they really were. Their spindly legs spread almost {{SI|6|ft}} across, and their bodies ended in a swollen bulge of flesh from which a writhing swarm of tails protruded, each tipped with an upward-curving ovipositor.\n\nEkolids varied in color from brown to red, though normal traits included a pale, yellow underbelly and vertical, crimson mandibles gnashing below a cluster of black eyes.",

        "Personality": "Ekolids were intelligent creatures ruled by the constant, primal urge to reproduce. The only recognizable emotion they demonstrated was delighted chattering, displayed when their young burst from a host.",
        "Abilities": "Ekolids were incredibly fast creatures that scuttled, climbed and flew with near-supernatural speed. Though their individual stings and bites weren't particularly deadly on their own, they could strike several times in less than a second, and their injections implanted the enemy with an egg that would swiftly hatch.\n\nAs obyriths, the presence of ekolids infected non-demons with a specific form of madness, in their case, parasitosis. Those that succumbed to their mind-warping influence started hallucinating that tiny, biting insects were infesting their hair, skin clothes, a permanent itching distraction that would forever impede their concentration until the condition was [[heal|cured]]. The presence of several ekolids made it harder to resist the delusion, but the condition didn't worsen after already contracted, and one would be immune to a particular individual's influence for a day after enduring it.",
        "Combat": "Despite being quite intelligent, ekolids made use of simple tactics in combat. Ekolids relied mainly on their speed, and would rush to implant all potential victims and enemies with at least one egg each before retreating to await the birth of their young. Any survivors would be swiftly re-implanted to begin the cycle anew.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Ekolids were the minions of Obox-Ob, serving as the vile nobles of his demonic aristocracy in Zionyn. The ekolids constructed cathedrals, as well as vast temples dedicated to the Prince of Vermin, and their buildings of preserved corpses brought him great glee."
        },
        "Homelands": "Outside of Zionyn, ekolids were particularly prevalent on [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 2: Driller's Hives|Driller's Hives]], the 2{{nd}} layer of the [[Abyss]], and on the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 377: Plains of Gallenshu|Plains of Gallenshu]]  the 377{{th}} layer. and was home to massive hives of insects that eternally warred against one another, while in the latter layer the ekolids served as a constant menace for the native [[armanite]]s.\n\nDespite their importance in their culture, the meticulous Zionyn ekolids had little patience for mortals and often attacked them on sight, creating deadly situations on the rare occasion a group of them came to the [[Material Plane]]. Once there, they often started constructing recreations of their home[[plane]], covering existing stone structures with corpses rather than using them as the main material.",
        "Reproduction/Life Cycle": "Hundreds of eggs could be generated within an ekolid's body in only an hour, so the only thing limiting their violent reproduction was the availability of living victims to infest. Though they weren't a disease and creatures immune to diseases could still be infected, ''[[remove disease]]'' spells could also destroy unhatched eggs.\n\nUsing their ovipositors, they implanted eggs just under the skin of their victims, only for the eggs to hatch a few seconds afterwards. Once the egg hatched, a ravenous grub would consume its way out of its host, leaving the victim incredibly nauseous and in serious pain due to the deep, bloody holes in their bodies.\n\nThe infantile grubs, though ravenous, were effectively harmless, able to killed rather easily, but they grew to maturity in only six hours. Fortunately for non-ekolids, the voracity of the young worked against their race as a whole, ensuring that only one or two siblings would survive after their siblings had been cannibalized.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Rumors spoke of truly gargantuan, as well as unusually dim-witted, ekolids, though if such creatures existed, they likely did so only on the farthest fringes of the Abyss."
