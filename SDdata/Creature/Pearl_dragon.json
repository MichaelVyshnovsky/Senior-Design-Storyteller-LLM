        "mainbody": "'''Pearl dragons''' were a species of [[gem dragon]] easily identified by their [[pearl]]-like scales.",
        "Description": "Pearl dragons were most known for their pearl-like scales, which grew increasingly lustrous as they aged. They were smaller than most other dragons, ranging in size from as little as {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in length as hatchlings, to as much as {{SI|86|ft|long=yes}} in length as great wyrms.",
        "Personality": "Pearl dragons were reclusive by nature and rarely aggressive or violent.",
        "Abilities": "Pearl dragons spoke only their own dialect, but could telepathically communicate with other telepathic or exceptionally intelligent creatures. Because of their relatively small size, their fear aura was less powerful than that of other dragons, but outside of combat, these dragons could use a combination of riddling talk and personal charm to entrance other creatures.\n\nPearl dragons had a breath weapon in the form of a cloud of scalding steam that could be as much as {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} long, {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} wide, and {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} high.\n\nThey had superior magical abilities, being capable of casting both wizardly and priestly spells. They also could ''[[blink]]'' six times per day.",
        "Combat": "Pearl dragons tended to rely on their [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] and spells in combat, but were still willing to use their claws and fangs in melee if necessary.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Pearl dragons primarily ate [[shark]]s and other [[fish]], as well as small [[whale]]s or hundreds of [[lobster]]s as a treat.",
            "Habitats": "A pearl dragon was reported to live in the sea caves along the western shore of the [[Lake of Steam]].<ref>",
            "Relationships": "Pearl dragons typically stayed at a safe distance from [[human]] civilization and rarely attacked sailing ships. However, they were known to attack pirate ships that bothered them, and take all the treasure found therein. They were natural enemies of [[dragon turtle]]s.",
            "Usage": "Their hides were known to sell for as much as 60,000 gold pieces."
