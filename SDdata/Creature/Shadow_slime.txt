A '''shadow slime''' was a type of [[ooze]] that originated in the [[Shadowfell]].{{Cite dragon/367/Bestiary: Mindless Monstrosities|45-46}} As such, they dwelt around [[shadow]] creatures, particularly [[shadow dragon]]s.

==Description==
Shadow slimes were corrupted [[green slime]]s that thrived in the presence of shadow creatures. As with many other oozes, they clung to ceilings and waited for their prey to come to them.

Such slimes were almost impossible to spot, as they were always concealed. Even illumination from the ''[[light]]'' [[spell]] did not reveal them. Only the ''[[daylight]]'' spell was able to reveal such foes.

==Combat==
As soon as shadow slimes detected movement, they would drop on top of their prey. They sucked the moisture and heat energy right out of their foes, damaging them and draining their power in the process. They could also damage items made of bone, wood, and leather.

Only [[fire]]-, sonic-, electric-, and sunlight-based attacks would cause damage to these vicious oozes. However, ''[[remove disease]]'' and ''[[deathward]]'' could also destroy patches of shadow slimes.

As well as dropping on their foes, they could extinguish light sources, and then ''[[shadow jump]]'' to their target.
