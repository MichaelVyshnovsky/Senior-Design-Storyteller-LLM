A flying monkey was a type of monkey that was capable of flight.
The fur of flying monkeys appeared in a variety of different colors. They had feathered wings that spanned about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length.
These monkeys were more inquisitive and intelligent than their flightless cousins. 
When they fought other creatures, flying monkeys attacked them flocks and bit at their prey.
Flying monkeys were native to the jungles of Chult.
Trained winged monkeys could be found in the library of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers of Suzail. The librarian monkeys retrieved and put away books alongside giant owls.
