A '''flying monkey''' was a type of [[monkey]] that was capable of flight.

==Description==
The fur of flying monkeys appeared in a variety of different colors. They had feathered wings that spanned about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length.

==Behavior==
These monkeys were more inquisitive and intelligent than their flightless cousins. 

==Combat==
When they fought other creatures, flying monkeys attacked them flocks and bit at their prey.

==Ecology==
Flying monkeys were native to the jungles of [[Chult]].

Trained winged monkeys could be found in the library of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] of [[Suzail]]. The librarian monkeys retrieved and put away [[book]]s alongside [[giant owl]]s.

==Notable Flying Monkeys==
*[[Feg]]: the [[albino]] [[bat]]-winged flying monkey from [[Tantras]] that belonged to [[Kaverin Ebonhand]] of the [[Cult of Frost]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].
