Giant praying mantises, also called gargantuan praying mantises, were larger versions of praying mantises.
Giant praying mantises, like their smaller cousins, were camouflaged to look like the leaves of plants.
These carnivorous insects could stand motionless, hidden in foliage, until they struck out silently on approaching prey. They gripped their prey tightly in their claws and then bit down with their mandibles.
In Faerûn they could be found in the forest of Cormanthor. Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in parts of Kara-Tur. 
Beyond Toril, they were among the most dangerous predators of equatorial Karpri.
The gargantuan praying mantises of Cormanthor were the primary predators of the forests giant stag beetles.
