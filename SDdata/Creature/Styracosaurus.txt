Styracosaurus () was a species of dinosaur related to the Triceratops.
Styracosaurs looked like their cousin triceratops. It had a single horn above its snout and several grew from the top of its large, bony head crest. 
Styracosaurs were known for being aggressive.
Styracosaurs used their crest spikes against any large predator who tried to bite their vulnerable hind quarters. Against smaller predators, styracosaurs charged towards them, using their great size and weight to crush them.
Styracosaurs were herbivores and lived in herds.
