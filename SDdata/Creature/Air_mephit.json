        "Description": "An air mephit was about four feet (120 centimeters) tall and weighed only a pound (half a kilogram). They had pale white skin. Like all mephits, air mephits were [[imp]]ish in appearance and had wispy wings, which sprouted from their humanoid upper torsos. They had whirlwinds where one would expect their legs to be.",
        "Personality": "Air mephits tended to be more skittish than other mephits.",
        "Abilities": "Air mephits could heal themselves as long as there was moving air present. They had the ability to breathe a conical cloud of dust and grit. They also had the innate power to surround themselves with vapor about once every hour or to call forth a powerful [[gust of wind]] once per day. They were immune to the effects of lightning or poisons.",
        "Combat": "Air mephits would rather flee than fight, but, if pressed, would attack by biting and clawing and also by injuring opponents with their breath.",
