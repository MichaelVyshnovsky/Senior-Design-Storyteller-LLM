The '''sharns''' were mysterious, tripartite [[aberration]]s that embodied [[magic]]al chaos. They were also called '''shiftshades''', '''blackclaws''', '''simmershadows''', '''skulkingdeaths''', and '''fhaorn'quessir'''.

==Description==
Sharns had two physical forms. Their first form was their natural one, the form they were in most often. It was as a slimy, cold pseudo-fluid. With a thought they were capable of assuming their second, more commonly encountered form.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|55}} This second form was of a large body&mdash;up to {{SI|15|feet|long=yes}} tall and weighing {{SI|3000|pounds|k|long=yes}}&mdash;shaped like a teardrop with amorphous, hairless, and oily black flesh surrounded by a nimbus of purple light. Their massive black and silver bodies were lit by continual magical flares. They each had three huge, eyeless eel-like heads which only consisted of two nostrils and a large mouth with sharp fangs dripping saliva. All three heads were connected to a single 'trunk'. Despite their ungainly form, sharns were very quick, and appeared at all times like they were under the effects of a ''[[haste]]'' spell.

The main distinguishing physical feature of a sharn was their unique and unusual arms. They had three arms, each starting as a solid trunk that ended in a joint. From each joint grew three arms that looked like a [[humanoid]]s forearm. Each of these forearms were covered in small eyes. Each forearm ended in a hand that also looked humanoid.

==Abilities==
[[File:Sharn portal.jpg|thumb|left|360px|''A sharn attacking through one of its hex portals.'']]Sharns were capable of naturally creating hexagonal [[portal]]s that acted as windows between themselves and other points in space nearby. The sharn could see and even reach through these windows, although others could not reach back, and the portals could move at the sharn's command. They could create up to six such portals at a time.2{{nd}} edition sources states they could create up to six portals at a time but this was later reduced to three in 3{{rd}} edition in ''[[Monsters of Faerûn]]''.

Sharns were immune to all charm, enchantment and illusion-based affects and spells. If their minds were linked to that of another creature, they could psionically muddle the other creatures mind, similar to a ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell. They were also immune to any spell that caused the target to change shape, in fact sharns themselves were unable to shapeshift even if they tried, such as with the ''[[polymorph]]'' spell. Peculiarly, it was also impossible for other creatures to ''polymorph'' into the shape of a sharn.

All sharn were able to cast spells but a small percentage of sharns were very powerful spellcasters. Every sharn could cast both [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] spells. For divine spells, sharns had access to the [[Chaos domain|chaos]], [[Death domain|death]], [[Knowledge domain|knowledge]], [[Luck domain|luck]], [[Magic domain|magic]], [[Protection domain|protection]], [[Travel domain|travel]] and [[Trickery domain|trickery]] domains. Sharn used magic differently than most creatures. With the sharn, spells were used innately rather than through memorization and did not require the use of [[Spell focus|foci]], [[material component|material]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] or [[verbal component]]s. If a spell cast by a sharn interacted with the phaerimm spells ''[[life drain]]'' or ''[[magic drain]]'', the resulting reaction caused the nearby terrain to become drastically altered.

Sharns could both activate and detect [[earth node]]s.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|57}} They had the ability to slowly regenerate physical injuries.

Following the events of the [[Spellplague]], many sharns became [[plaguechanged]] and could wield [[plaguefire]].

==Personality==
Sharn motives and reasoning often seemed inscrutable to most people. When they spoke, it was with different voices from each of their three mouths.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|53}}

==Combat==
A sharn could wield up to nine weapons simultaneously. They were naturally skilled in the use of nearly all melee weapons. If lacking a weapon, a sharn attacked an opponent with sharp claws. They positioned their hexagonal portals to strike at opponents from multiple directions, or to cast spells at targets they might not otherwise have been able to see.

==Society==
As creatures highly sensitive to magical resonances, the sharn regarded themselves as keepers and protectors of the [[Weave]], and would hunt down those they believed abused it.

The sharns weren't very numerous, yet it was believed that they could rule all of [[Faerûn]] if that had interested them. Their society housed a lot of political argument and social intrigue, and their power struggles, which were typically based on ideological conflicts, were near-constant. Furthermore, the sharns were noted to spend the majority of their time engaged in internal debates and experiments, with only younger sharns occasionally taking an interest in the affairs of mortals. Sharns communicated with each other using short-range mass telepathy.

Sharns lived in large clans, called "pools" after the fact that they often dwelt in large pools of amorphous black goo into which their bodies could transform.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|56}} Each clan was ruled by a council, and sharns of the same clan shared a communal consciousness but retained individual intelligence. Sharn clans usually avoided becoming involved in the affairs of other creatures who lived nearby.

Sharns loathed the [[phaerimm]].

==Ecology==
An area of the [[Underdark]] called the [[Sharnlands]] was home to a large number of clans, but due to their interests in planar travel and manipulating environments with magic, sharns could live anywhere they pleased. They were most often encountered in subterranean environments,

Sharns were omnivores and their diet mainly consisted of animals, lichens, roots and plants.

Sharns were asexual. It was once thought that they reproduced via budding such that when they reached a certain age, they created a bud from their own cells which developed into a young sharn resembling the parent.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|60}} Sharns were seemingly immortal, although they grew more powerful as they grew older and elder sharns eventually disappeared for unknown reasons.

Unlike most creatures, sharns lacked internal organs, as well as a circulatory and nervous system. Due to a lack of lungs, this allowed the sharn to function normally in airless environments.

==History==
===Origins===
The first sharns were the surviving citizens of the ancient [[dark elf]] and [[wood elf]] realm known as [[Miyeritar]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|author=[[Steven E. Schend]]|title=Blackstaff: Chapters 18 – 27|topicid=7223|postid=149882|date=2006-08-22|accessdate=2008-04-21}} [[Aryvandaar]]an historians discovered a familial link between the family of their ruler, Coronal [[Ivósaar Vyshaan]], and the [[Olrythii]], the ruling house of Miyeritar. Circa {{Yearlink|-14700}}, the [[Vyshaanti]] began negotiating to annex Miyeritar peacefully, but the Miyeritaari resisted. Around {{Yearlink|-13200}}, the powerful [[sun elf]] realm [[Aryvandaar]] began raiding along Miyeritar's borders and interfering with its trade routes, and around {{Yearlink|-12000}} Aryvandaar mounted an all-out invasion of Miyeritar, thus beginning the [[Crown Wars#First Crown War|First Crown War]]. Circa {{Yearlink|-11800}} Aryvandaaran forces had occupied Miyeritar, and by {{Yearlink|-11300}}, while the Second Crown War was raging between [[Ilythiir]], [[Thearnytaar]], [[Eiellûr]], [[Syòrpiir]], and [[Orishaar]], Aryvandaar had conquered Miyeritar, ending the First Crown War.

Dark and wood elf clans in Miyeritar continued to resist Aryvandaar, then called the Vyshaantar Empire, and around {{Yearlink|-10500}}, during the Third Crown War, Vyshaan high mages produced a terrible magical storm called the [[Dark Disaster]], or the Killing Storms, that hung over Miyeritar for months and laid waste to it, turning it into an infertile wasteland that became known as the [[High Moor]]. The fell magic proceeded unopposed because of a Vyshaantar assassination campaign that had killed many Miyeritaari high mages in the months before.

Three grand mages of Miyeritar—[[T'karon]], [[Hamra]], and [[Alunor]]—who would become known as the [[Three Watchers]], devised the means to become sharns—using the [[Ritual of Myriad]]{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|author=[[Steven E. Schend]]|title=Blackstaff: Chapters 18 – 27|topicid=7223|postid=167110|date=2006-12-30|accessdate=2008-04-21}} It was unclear whether the transformation was intentional—in order to preserve their civilization in the hopes that it would one day rise again—or if the ritual had been intended to defeat the Dark Disaster, but went wildly wrong. Regardless, these sharns melted together into black goo and drained into the lands beneath the surface where they slumbered for millenia in the first sharn pools.

The elves of [[Uvaeren]] also later became sharns. In Mirtul of the {{YearlinkName|611}}, the members of the [[Pentad Retreat]] also became sharns after the traitorous precept, the vampire wizard [[Palron Kaeth]], used the [[orc]]s of the [[Everhorde]] to attack their hidden enclave.
{{Quote|Through us your civilization can endure.|A sharn}}

===War with the Phaerimm===
The original sharn from Miyeritar were reawakened by the [[Shattering (Calimshan)|Shattering]] of {{Yearlink|-7684}}. They found themselves with an instinctual hatred of magical abuses—like the Dark Disaster or Shattering—burned into their minds, leading them to act as self-appointed custodians of the Weave. They hunted down those who would evoke great magical disasters, and when unable to stop them, would preserve some of the victims as fellow sharns.

In the {{YearlinkName|-354}}, their first recorded clash with the phaerimms occurred after the phaerimms' use of lifedraining magics caught the sharns' attention. In the {{YearlinkName|329}}, the sharns finally imprisoned the phaerimms behind the [[Sharn Wall]] beneath [[Anauroch]], in the [[Buried Realms]], which the phaerimms called the Phaerlin.

===The 14{{th}} Century DR===
By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], most of the seemingly omnipotent elder sharns had phased out of existence, leaving the remaining ones without their critical guidance.

The sharns collected items of Miyeritar scattered all across [[Faerûn]] for a high magic ritual that would restore the high magic city of Faer'tel'miir, an ancient city of Miyeritar that was located on what is now the High Moor. The last time the sharns had acted with such purpose was when they constructed the Sharn Wall around the phaerimms. Usually, magical fields or internal conflicts among their collective mind made them act unpredictably or madly, disruptiing their efforts.

On the [[Feast of the Moon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the malignant magic of the Killing Storms was cleansed from the area (the entire High Moor was gradually being cleansed of the corruptive magic, which would take centuries to conclude{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|author=[[Steven E. Schend]]|title=Blackstaff: Chapters 28 – 40|topicid=7224|whichpage=3|postid=143947|date=2006-07-24|accessdate=2008-04-21}}), and the Library City of Miyeritar, Faer'tel'miir was restored and renamed [[Rhymanthiin]], the Hidden City of Hope, through a High Magic Ritual. [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] and [[Ualair]] sacrificed their lives to restore Rhymanthiin, and their spirits went to [[Arvandor]], the elven heaven. Most of the sharns shed their skins, which become a part of the walls of the city, and returned to their original forms.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|author=[[Steven E. Schend]]|title=Blackstaff: Chapters 28 – 40|topicid=7224|whichpage=2|postid=143532|date=2006-07-21|accessdate=2008-04-21}}

Some sharns of Miyeritar choose to remain sharns, for they knew that they would become [[drow]] if they relinquished their sharn forms (for they were still subject to Corellon's curse laid upon the dark elves). They remained Rhymanthiin's defenders and worked against corrupt magic in the Realms. They could form from any wall or street of the city to apprehend malefactors due to the sharnstuff woven into the city. All former sharns and those who partook in the ritual were granted a home in the city. The new Rhymanthiin served as a center for magic, knowledge, lore, and the unity of different races, and those with malice in their hearts would not find their way there.

===The 15{{th}} Century DR===
[[File:Sharn cultist 4e.jpg|thumb|300px|''A member of the Order of Blue Flame seeks guidance from a sharn.'']]As creatures closely tied to magic, the [[Spellplague]] quickly infected nearly all sharns,{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|59}} The Plague turned the sharns' skin a metallic blue, with blue plaguefire replaced the purple flares that had once adorned their bodies, while the plaguechanged pools they called home glowed blue and bubbled violently. Those infected did not see this as a curse or disease, however, rather they viewed the Spellplague as the last remains of the Weave that they had struggled to protect for millenia, and thus viewed spreading the Spellplague to be their duty. They soon became closely associated with the [[Order of Blue Flame]], which revered them as avatars of the Spellplague itself,

As of the 1470s DR, the sharn were actively exploring the [[plagueland]]s of [[Halruaa]], especially the ruins of [[Halarahh]] in search of ''[[Zalathorm's Clockwork Sceptre]]''. Just as they had transformed past survivors of magical disasters into fellow sharn, so too had they assimilated many remaining Halruaans.
