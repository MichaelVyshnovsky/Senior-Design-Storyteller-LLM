They could also result from exposure to fire elemental energy.\nFire genasi could summon nonmagical flame. They were also resistant to fire.\nFire genasi were generally energetic and quick to act, They often cared a great deal about their appearance, and dressed flamboyantly.\nFire genasi could be found anywhere, but were most commonly found in Calimshan,\nFire genasi could worship any deity, but clerics were devotees of Gond, Talos, or Kossuth.\nthumb|right|300px|A crew of fashionable fire genasi enforcers heating things up in the streets.\n* Daelegoth Orndeir, leader of the Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun. \n* Hurnoj Rikrekts, servant of Krashos Morueme in Ched Nasad.\n* Pristoleph, leader of Innarlith."
