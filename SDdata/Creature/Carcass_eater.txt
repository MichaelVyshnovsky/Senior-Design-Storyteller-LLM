'''Carcass eaters''' were a type of animalistic, burrowing [[zombie]], They were said to arise from rodents that had gorged on the flesh of a necrotic canine.

==Description==
These [[undead]] were small in size and streaked in gore. They looked to be a cross between [[giant rat]]s and desiccated [[wolves]], most distinctly having the ears and tail of a rat. Though the size of their toothy jaws was unlike that of any wolf and spikes jutted from their body. On average their bodies measured {{SIrange|3|4|ft|long=yes}} in length and weighed around {{SIrange|65|75|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Abilities==
These undead could see in areas of [[low-light vision|low-light]] and [[darkvision|total darkness]].

==Combat==
Carcass eaters preferred to fight in groups, surrounding and flanking their foes. They fought with their sharp claws and teeth. Upon the scent of blood they would fly into a frenzy and temporarily become stronger, though easier to harm.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
These undead had no requirement to eat in order to survive, yet they still often feasted upon flesh.<ref> They typically obtained this by digging up fresh graves, though if these were not readily available they would go hunting at night.
===Habitats===
On the [[Prime Material plane]], these creatures were typically found in temperate forests.

In the [[Shadowfell]], carcass eaters could be found in the [[Burning Woods]], a dark reflection of [[Faer√ªn]]'s [[Neverwinter Wood]]s.

===Relationships===
These undead could often be found in the company of other undead, such as [[deathlock wight]]s, or under the control of a [[necromancer]] or [[evil]] [[cleric]].
