'''Tatterdemanimals''' were a variation of [[raggamoffyn]] composed of small dirty scraps of cloth. They were the least dangerous form of raggamoffyn.

==Combat==
All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creature's control.

Tatterdemanimals were only able to attach to small or tiny targets, usually going for [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s, [[pig]]s, [[bird]]s, and small [[dog]]s.

These creatures were immune to blunt weapons, but were particularly susceptible to fire-based attacks.

==Society==
Tatterdemanimals often gathered together in small groups, controlling packs of small animals.
