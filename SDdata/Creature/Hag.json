        "Hags delight in suffering, priding themselves on creating new and inventive ways to torment those in their 'care'. \n|Elizabeth B. Soot from \"A Brush with Evil: On Hags\"\n}}\n\n[[Evil]] was at the core of what defined hags, an inextricable part of their identity. They were representatives of malice and malignancy, paragons of corruption who took unbridled joy in creating misery and misfortune for the virtuous and content. To simply call them evil was itself an understatement; petty, avaricious, conniving, merciless, abhorrent, and oppressive simply scratched the descriptive surface. Their reversed sense of value extended to aesthetics as well, for hags were known to relish their moral and physical ugliness, as well as the horror that they evoked, and be disgusted by the beautiful to the point of disfiguring those who were attractive. Despite embodying that which was horrible and brutal in nature, they still disrupted the natural order, for hags were miserable creatures of scorn and hate that did evil purely for evil's sake.": "==Unpredictable===",
        "Want to know a dark secret? Ask a hag. The trick lies in getting the truth out of her.\n|[[Volo]]\n}}\n\nIn the event that a hag was acting friendly, or at the very least ambivalent, it was important to remember that hags ultimately didn't care about the thoughts or desires of anyone but themselves. Like cantankerous grandmothers, hags viewed those younger than themselves with opinionated stubbornness, freely and bluntly saying whatever idea came to mind. These could be lewd jokes or comments at their expense or more threatening asides about various means with which they could be harmed, and by no means were hags hesitant to make good on these statements if made to lose their tempers.\n\n[[File:Baba_Lysaga.png|thumb|right|200px|''[[Baba Lysaga]], an ancient hag capable of love.'']]\nThe schemes of hags were patient, their webs of manipulation wide, and their understanding of mortal vices, as well as how to manipulate them, great.": "==Bargaining===",

        "And while I have escaped, I spend every waking moment in fear that either her or one of her 'sisters' will come for me. For a hag coven does not let even the smallest of slights go unpunished.\n|Elizabeth B. Soot from \"A Brush with Evil: On Hags\"\n}}\nHags had no desire to be tied down by others, taking pride in their independence from the rest of the world, including from other hags. Nonetheless, despite how different they could be, all hags recognized each other as kindred spirits, members of a kind of sinister sisterhood by which they were undeniably connected. Even though hags didn't like each other, they were still members of their shadowy sorority and as such had to abide by an ageless code of conduct when dealing with one another. For example, they always had to announce their presence when entering another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's home, and keep oaths made to other hags, at least so long as their fingers weren't crossed.\n\nLike all sisters, hags squabbled and bickered, and at worst these rivalries became century-spanning feuds of manipulation and counter-scheming. This sisterly bond meant they might also reconcile, perhaps if a source of mutual hatred presented itself, and while these relationships were largely lacking in emotion, they were often the closest hags had to \"friends\". Because all hags kept at least some contact with one another, trading secrets, gossip, and warnings through a vast network of magic, personal visits, and messengers, even an utter hermit of a hag had some awareness of surrounding events, and most hags could be said to have at least some vague, secondhand information about any other hag.\n\nThis also meant that hags were aware when one of their kind was attacked or killed, to which they could have all manner of responses. Hags that were liked might be avenged, those who owed debts might have that debt moved to the killers, and hags that were hated or had debts to hold over others were happily sent off and the killers treated to relative cordiality. All hags were members of a grander pecking order both within their subrace and in the hag race as a whole, determined by age, powers, influence, allies, and experience. Some of these things were earned, while others were inherited from the hag that spawned them, so the determinations of a hag's status were by no means fair. In this, at least to the eyes of mortals, incomprehensible hierarchical web, almost every hag knew their rank and vied in the chaotic system to raise it to a satisfactory point.": "==Coven===",
        "styles": "",
        "Evil beings, hags rely on magic, deceit, illusion and even blackmail to lure their victims in. I knew this. I repeated it many times to you, dear reader. But I did not realize their charm, their allure. I did not know I would come to love her. That I would yearn to please her. She strung me along, tempting me with my wildest dreams.\n|Elizabeth B. Soot from \"A Brush with Evil: On Hags\"\n}}\nWhile typically solitary, hags occasionally felt a desire for companionship, something they typically sated by collecting servitors. In no sense were these entities friends; the hag either [[charm]]ed the servant or had some way to threaten its life, either magical or mundane, and would insult and beat them on a whim. Even ordinary animals were retained as minions, commonly for the purpose of self-defense, a task for which bound mortals were the most delightful pawns. Innocent folk were an excellent defense against righteous opponents and their unassuming appearance allowed them to act as a hag's eyes and ears, whether they were acting as spies or representatives. Typically a hag's minions could be divided into two groups, the first being servants like [[construct]]s, [[undead]] creations, unintelligent vermin, and other things that a hag could trust to unquestionably obey their orders and protect her home.\n\nThe other type were brutes, mercenaries under a hag's employ with free will that ran errands, roughed up assigned targets, patrolled unimportant areas and otherwise attended to laborious tasks beneath the hag's personal attention. Though hags were known to employ ogres, the term brute was generally misleading since hags preferred employees willing and capable of cunning cruelty as opposed to strong but stupid bumblers. These could be other kinds of evil [[giant]]s, [[lycanthrope]]s, dark fey, sneaky creatures like [[bugbear]]s, [[kenku]], and [[doppelganger]]s, or other strange monsters like [[ettercap]]s, [[gargoyle]]s,  and [[aberration]]s.\n\nHags were also known to augment their minions, whether brute or servant, giving them magic items and disguises or, whether intentional or not, twisting them into villainous fey versions of themselves. These wicked parodies were given powers befitting the hag's nature or that the hag thought would be useful, like limitless stamina, resistance to a certain element, transformations, or teleportation.\n\nHags were curious about other beings of power, including other hags, [[dragon]]s, fiends, [[genie]]s, and sometimes even mortals of great power, and had some small sliver of respect for those with accurate knowledge of such beings. Given their magical and political prowess, dangerous beings might be under a hag's sway, whether returning a favor or paying off a supernaturally enforced blood debt. Hags were known to put themselves in servitor positions, offering their dark knowledge to powerful evil entities, but whether as oracles or simple advisors they were typically unfaithful to their masters if presented with a chance to usurp. Conversely, the heinous deeds of hags earned them powerful enemies, good-aligned dragons and giants being known to hunt them and kill them if given the chance.": "==Mortals===",

        "mainbody": "Though this time was horrible, it was merely a phase; Cegilune's hateful response proved unwise as her younger rivals had far more collective worshipers then she did, and those that weren't killed were driven to the dark wilderness of the world. Cegilune herself was left weakened by her tantrum, for even having hoarded her power, the fit left her exhausted and ruined her beauty, leaving her a pale reflection of herself and forcing her too to flee to the deepest, loneliest crater in existence. Her followers found themselves twisted by the malevolence infused in what once was her blessings, her water-walking prophets becoming sea hags, sweet-voiced songs becoming green hags, and powerful protectors becoming annis hags. In more recent times, the hags, still beings of darkness driven by ancient spite, schemed to bring suffering to mortals. The moon goddess herself, now only full of hate, fostered her remaining divinity to bring ruin to the mortal races she saw as traitors and to extinguish the risen stars, in her opinion the impostor gods of the night, that took her place.",
        "Description": "Hags were almost universally unique in their exact forms and mannerisms, but there were typically common physical traits between them. Generally, hags looked like crooked crones, wrinkled and withered women of unsightly appearance with blotchy skin marred by warts and moles. Their long, skinny fingers were tipped by talon-like nails as tough as steel and as sharp as blades, and their mouths were filled with sharp, blackened teeth and noxious breath. Long, frayed hair ringed their creased faces, but even though their faces were heavy from their malice, the glimmer of sly villainy could still be seen in their eyes.\n[[File:NymphNR.png|thumb|left|200px|''A [[nymph]] drinks a potion brewed by a hag...'']]\n\nNormally hags wore simple clothing like those of female peasants, if more ragged and dirty, but not for a lack of interest in their appearance. In fact, hags were very concerned with their appearance, taking steps to ensure they were at their worst by rubbing filth onto their clothes and accessorizing their gross garb with gruesome decorations. They would modify their clothes with bits of gore and refuse, wear bits of skin and bone, spin cloth from innards and put all manner of litter in their hair, and those were only the things they would wear. They were also known to augment their actual bodies, such as by sharpening their teeth to make themselves more fearsome, picking at scabs to produce weeping sores, and otherwise exacerbating their deformities with nurturing attentiveness.\n[[File:HagNR.png|thumb|right|200px|''...to return to her former hideousness.'']]\n\nHowever, if a hag needed to not invoke utter disgust, they could magically disguise themselves, the exact limits of their illusions being specific to different types. Almost all types could take on the forms of regular old ladies, Regardless of what guise they donned or act they put on however, such impersonation would always be superficial, because the physical forms of all hags were merely reflections, the twisted moldings of the ugliness in their own hearts.",

            "Bargaining": "{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 250px\n| source = [[Elminster]]\n| text   = Hags often appear unlooked for, in moments of great need, because they have been spying and see an opportunity to aid now to set up darker mischief later.\n}}\n\nDespite their myriad flaws, hags were not just willing, but happy to make bargains with others, although not out of any sense of genuine generosity. The baleful busybodies enjoyed sticking their noses in other people's business, offering deals that required one to either compromise their values or do something to make the deal ultimately not worth it. For a hag, the bargain was the most delicious way to fell a mortal because they would be complicit in their own wonderful corruption, making it much more enjoyable than blatant violence or straightforward tyranny.\n\nIn terms of bargaining behavior, hags could be compared to fiends, both of which used their many resources to make deals with mortals in order to corrupt them, but there was a fundamental difference between the two. Whether [[devil]] or [[demon]], fiends typically made deals with mortals ultimately to obtain the [[soul]], a powerful and versatile commodity that would grant them greater status, with the mortal's induction to a particular vile ethos being the means of obtaining it. The emotional state of their marks by the end wasn't necessarily a relevant factor to the fiendish corrupter.\n\nUnlike fiends, hags approached the bargain from the perspective of a hobbyist, corrupting mortals for the fun of making others miserable and not caring about their particular cosmic fate. Obviously such a dichotomy didn't always apply; fiends generally enjoyed torture and torment and hags were known to make deals for purely pragmatic reasons, even if doing so didn't actively ruin anyone's lives.",
            "Weaknesses": "Hags tolerated little disrespect in regards to mortals because all possessed at least one crippling weakness: arrogance. Hags treated almost all other beings, particularly [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s, as inferiors, believing themselves to be the most cunning of all beings. and while they were extremely clever, their confidence could lead them to accidentally reveal something during conversation that the more cautious wouldn't let slip.\n\nIf one did need to make a deal with a hag, the best way, if one could be said to exist, was when one could offer the hag something they needed or wanted. In the mind of the hag, part of their compensation for any given service was the suffering of the other party, and giving them something they genuinely desired made the matter more about sating their greed than their sadism. Because hags weren't subtle about self-expression, it would immediately become clear when a hag wanted to have or observe something, such as an odd spell, magic item, or person with bizarre magical abilities, sometimes snatching the object out of the holder's hands to perform more thorough examination. They would smell, shake, taste, feel, and hear the subject, person or otherwise, whispering to themselves before finally placing a mental value on it.\n\nA bribe that would be either unique or useful, or at least enough so to a rival that she wouldn't want her to have it, a hag would pay a high price to obtain. This could possibly be in the form of freeing captives or granting requested knowledge regarding local lore, evil creatures, or mysterious magic, and such deals were unlikely to have dire consequences."
        },
        "Abilities": "The powers of hags were as variable as they were, but there were several common abilities between them. The decrepit frame of hags belied their supernatural strength and swiftness, for the crones could crush smaller beings one-handed and easily jump obstructions in their path.",
        "Combat": {
            "Escape": "Hags always kept at least three home escape plans, one for general threats and two for likely situations like certain hazards or enemy attacks, in mind if they became outmatched, or just if the need to quickly vacate the premises presented itself. These plans used a combination of innate magic, supernatural items and techniques, guile, and help from others. After escaping, they would immediately plot to serve cold revenge back to the interlopers or their families, even if the original mortal was long dead.\n\nBefore even getting to that point however, hags made aware of a serious danger would make use of every dirty trick in the book to try and gain an upper hand. If threatened by a legitimately threatening force, they would feign weakness to prey on braggarts or the merciful so as to be spared, or at least buy time. They would lie, cheat, bribe, cajole, shame, tempt, terrify, divide and otherwise exploit their enemies in any way they believed would work, relying on shrewdness born of age to defeat superior opposition. For example, a hag might offer some secret knowledge or magical item to her assailants in exchange for their lives, holding back parts of the identification or delivering instructions that could backfire with curses or unseen side effects.\n\nTypically a mortal would have to be the one to start hostilities, because hags would rather combat those incapable of defending themselves than fight fairly, attacking the weak or sleeping rather than the tough and alert. Though a hag's claws were dangerous weapons, their favors had fell far more opponents, and if they were resorting to their nails it was a good indicator that something had gone seriously wrong."

        "Society": {
            "Coven": "[[File:Coven.png|thumb|left|300px|A coven composed of (left to right) an annis hag, shrieking hag, and green hag.]]\n\nHags typically shuddered at the thought of having to share their homes and under ordinary circumstances would do no such thing. However, if something required hags to put forth a unified front, either a common goal or threat which couldn't be completed or defeated alone, then they would combine their efforts to form one of the infamous hag covens or coveys. This was only done as a necessity since it required the bickering beldames, who in fairness were often like-minded to some degree, to both deal with the inconvenience of living with other hags and suppress their instinctual selfishness to treat each other as equals.\n\nThough they behaved with some semblance of civility, coven hags still wanted to increase their personal power, and so the third coven mate served to deal with disputes when the other two inevitably started arguing. Three was the typical number of members in hag covens, but any grouping of hags larger than that, the maximum in a single coven being thirteen, usually ended in catastrophe.",
            "Lairs": "{{fq\n| text   =  You come to my home, interfere in my business, and now have the gall to face me in the heart of my lair? You petulant bollocks.\n| source = Auntie Ethel a [[hag]].\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nA hag's lair, no matter it's form, was an unpleasant, disturbing thing which, like her form and magic, was a representation of herself. Normally there was some element of corruption and death; a dead tree, a cave resembling a skull or possibly an actual giant skull. At other times they were more obviously manufactured, resembling taverns, ruined towers, mausoleums, giant coffins, and even [[gingerbread]] houses.\n\nThere was always some defense system in place, whether it was a naturally dangerous path, magical wards, or disguised captives to lure in the less prepared. They made their homes around mortal settlements, not so close as to be an obvious threat but close enough that a steady supply of malcontents could occasionally come seek her out.",

        "Relations": {
            "Mortals": "When hags made deal with mortals, the true consequences were often hidden, with the deal-maker in question sometimes even enjoying success for a time before a drawback presented itself. Those that came to them could find that a trait bestowed on a loved one had become too extreme, created some other flaw in them, or created a situation where the mortal was dependent on the hag. Desperation was the best bargaining tool of a hag, the common factor in a majority of their dealings being that others sought them out for help even when aware of their wicked ways out of sheer sense of necessity. Hags rarely looked for mortals to bargain with because their desire to make offers and enforce deals was outweighed by their love of being in positions of power, something that she gained when someone came to her instead of vice versa. This was especially useful if the visitor wanted to avoid being known to have dealings with the hags, adding time pressure to her list of advantages, and they were known to sweeten deals by including obviously exploitable loopholes.\n\n[[File:Hag_Cookies.png|left|thumb|250px|An \"old woman\" offers her fey visitors cookies.]]\nEven when clear evidence of a hag's negative influence on others lives was plain to see or common gossip in a town, they would still receive visitors from those foolish enough to believe she would show altruism. Some tried to invoke the hag code of conduct, not aware that those outside the sisterhood got no such courtesy, although the hag in question might play along for a while before revealing the invoker's folly. Out of a belief they were smarter, had less distortable desires, or were simply less greedy than those before them, there were those occasional few who continued to deal with hags and whose deals each hag remembered down to the letter. After years of slowly corrupting mortals one at a time, a hag's community of choice would run out of benevolence and the residents would become grim and hostile towards outsiders as a result of their own misery. Yet hags didn't completely crush all hope in a community; by providing the slightest glimmer of a chance that she would undo some of her foul works, hags kept leverage over the communities they corrupted, and so local leaders did what was in their power to stop interlopers from trying to defeat her.",
            "Fey": "[[File:Evilcookies.png|right|thumb|250px|A hag turns on her fellow fey with cookies that turn others into [[rabbit]]s.]]\nThough the former leant towards good and the latter towards evil, both the [[Seelie Court|Seelie]] and [[Unseelie Court]]s of the fey were admirers of true beauty and so both were relatively absent of hags. Even with their knowledge and magic, hags were only accepted as courtiers in courts if they were weak or humble enough to create a less hideous guise to prevent them from staining their surroundings. Given their love of personal freedom, hags had no problem with not being bound by the fickle whims of a fey queen. However, compared to their dealing with mortals, hags dealt with fey creatures, and other powerful creatures in general,"

I was a young fool, tis true, but those were dark days.\n}}Apart from gods, hags were known to be spiritual in sense that they had their own superstitions, the most famous of them being the Rule of Three. The Rule of Three was a [[plane|planar]] concept rooted in the realization that many realms and layers in the multiverse were arranged in multiples of three, and hags, as well as other users of witchcraft, were known to embrace the concept. As was said, all things came in groups of three, good, bad, and strange alike. Magic returned threefold upon its source, many spells were cast by chanting a phrase thrice, and covens required at least a trio to function. Though the oldest hags claimed to have invented it, or at the very least named it, the narcissism and lying nature of hags made this seem questionable, and there was also the possibility that some plane-traveling hags simply adopted the idea for themselves."

            "Hag Eyes": "An iconic part of hag mythology and one of their most potent creations were the magic items known as ''[[hag eye]]s'',<ref name= \"D331EGH\"/> made from gemstones of reportedly varying worth and the real eye of a hag's victim.\n\nAt the end of the ritual, the life essence of all hags in the coven was bound to the eye, allowing all members to see what the eye could see so long as it was on the same plane as them, the eye being able to see in the dark. Superficially, a hag's eye appeared as a semiprecious stone but a [[truesight]] revealed its true form as a monstrous, disembodied eye. Hag eyes weren't particularly difficult to destroy, and doing so caused all hag's in the coven great mental anguish as well as temporarily blinding at least one of them for an entire day. Creating a new one first required at least a day for the blinded coven mate to recover and had to be done at least three days after the eye was destroyed, some reports stating they could only make one once per month.\n\n[[File:Hageye.png|left|thumb|245px|A hag eye]]\nOften hag's eyes were coated in varnish and set into pendants, rings, medallions, brooches and other accessories before being given to unsuspecting enemies and victims as gifts or mementos, allowing the hag to know their every move. They were also commonly given to the minions, [[familiar]]s and [[animal companion]]s of a hag and used to watch over their dealings, aid them in patrols and communicate by combining their effect with spells like [[clairvoyance]], [[sending]], or [[whispering wind]]. Reports varied on how many hag's eyes a single coven could possess, ranging from just one to an effectively unlimited amount (although this meant creating several weak points for themselves), allowing them to keep watch over their territories with a magical surveillance system. Magic items that a hag needed to keep a literal eye on had the hag's eye worked into it so that they could chase down and slaughter the unsuspecting thief.<ref name= \"D331EGH\"/>",
            "Hag Brew": "[[File:HCNR.png|thumb|right|200px|''Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble.'']]\nJust as emblematic as the hag eyes were the bubbling cauldrons from which hags toiled trouble, combining wicked ritual and cannibalistic feast into a depraved form of mad alchemy. Within the shrieking, writhing soup of primordial ooze rose grotesque monsters and potions known as hag brews, the creation of which was based on similar principles to the creation of a hag eye. Once each month, on the night of a full moon, hags took part in the vile ceremony, which started an hour before midnight and ended an hour after. It required them to stay within {{SI|10|ft}} of one another the entire time and prevented them from making hag eyes that month or using their coven abilities the day after, the brewing having already expended all of such magic.\n\nThere was the Brew of Black Eyes, a thick, black substance given to those sent by a hag to track something important which required a coven of three different types of hags and a sliver of hag tongue to grant the drinker [[arcane sight]], [[darkvision]], and the ability to [[see invisibility]] for a week.{{cite web\n| url            = https://paizo.com/products/btpy7zel\n| title          = Powers of the Covey: Hag Brews\n| accessdate     = 2020-09-10\n| author         = [[F.

The Brew of Black Eyes for example required a sliver of hag tongue, the Brew of the Beloved needing the warty scalps of each creator as well as the hair of a dozen fair maidens, and the Brew of Cegilune's Blessing demanded a blood-stained idol of the goddess and ample portions of the creators' flesh. The brews of hags might also contain certain adverse side-effects. The Brew of Black Eyes gave the drinker nightmares that prevented them from sleeping properly and allowed the hags to force them into [[telepathy|telepathic]] correspondence. The Brew of Cegilune's Blessing on the other hand rendered any goodly being that drank it unconscious for several hours and sapped even more of their fortitude."

        "Ecology": {
            "Environment": "Hags typically dwelt in desolate regions with bleak and oppressive landscapes of all kinds, ranging from dark, thorny forests, gloomy, slogging swamps, bone-strewn glens, misty moors, stormy seacoasts, damp caverns, howling mountains, and biting tundras. Specific types had preferred environments but could be found out of them if traveling, part of a coven with more native hags, or if a long-range plan required a long period of time in an unfamiliar region, the lattermost option being most common for older and more powerful hags.\n\n[[File:Streethag.png|thumb|right|200px|Glurinda, a hag from the [[Shadowfell]]]]\n\nParticularly powerful hags began polluting the environment where they lived, their fell magic and foul nature twisting it just as their own malevolence shaped their powers. The land itself would become hostile, trees and vines attacking and dragging off passersby and fog turning the air toxic while concealing sinkholes and [[quicksand]].\n\nThough hags were known to inhabit both the Feywild and the Prime Material Plane, many were known to settle where the divide between the two was thin, allowing them to interact with beings from both realms. Even ignoring the Feywild, areas where magic energy was strong and the lines between worlds was tenuous were favorable to hags. For example, the ambient magical energy of a burial ground or a ring of fallen standing stones could still hold echoes of ancient, death-related power that a hag would wish to capitalize on.\n[[Category:Creatures found in the Domains of Dread]]",
            "Reproduction": "Given their nature as an all-female race, hags had to find other ways to reproduce beyond the conventional methods. There were many tales of the bizarre means through which hags came into the world; some stories reported that they spawned from animals, like cows with venomous milk or [[snake]] eggs kissed by virgins, while other processes were more artificial, like being incubated in the coffins of the unhallowed or being poured out from cauldrons of boiling blood. One of the most widely told tales of hag reproduction had to be that of the changeling.<ref name= \"D331EGH\"/>",
            "Subspecies": "'''[[Annis]]''' : The most physically powerful and feared of the hags, annis hags were ferocious savages with nails and teeth like iron. They were egotistical brutes who saw strength as virtue and appealed to simple-minded beings like children or primitives.\n\n'''[[Bheur]]''' : The unrivaled masters of winter witchcraft, bheur hags were blue-skinned beldames that made cold seasons even harsher than normal. They were cold-hearted crones who reveled in the greed that bad conditions brought out.\n\n'''[[Bog hag]]''' : A variety of hags that dwelt in swamps, bog hags were predators that hid behind a familiar face. After lying in wait below the water and killing their victims, the sinister body snatchers stole their skin, and sometimes their identities.\n[[File:Hags.jpg|thumb|right|(From left to right) A ''bheur hag'', ''hagspawn'', and ''shrieking hag''|250px]]\n'''[[Green hag]]''' : The most duplicitous and hateful hags, green hags used illusions and temptation to lead others to destruction and tragedy. The forest femme fatales sought to poison that which was pure and drag down the civilized world into barbarism.<ref name= \"D331EGH\"/>\n\n'''[[Hagspawn]]''' : The male counterparts to changelings, hagspawn inherited the strength and endurance of their forebears without the magic or inevitable transformation. They didn't grow into true hags like changelings did, and as such no male hags existed.\n\n'''[[Hannya]]''' : A variety of hag from [[Kara-Tur]], hannya were similar to [[yuan-ti]], former mortals that struck an unholy pact with an evil being to obtain great power. The serpentine subrace had telepathic powers and a strange aversion to [[violet]]s.\n\n'''[[Night hag]]''' : The most vile and nightmarish of the hags, night hags were fey turned fiends, so vile even compared to the rest of their kind that they were banished from the Feywild. The fiendish degenerates were soulmongers who traded [[larva]] in [[Hades]] for power and wealth.\n\n'''[[Sea hag]]''' : The indisputably ugliest of the hags, sea hags were decrepit piscine women of such hideousness that one could die from looking at them. The aquatic hags sought to defile and invert all that was beautiful.\n\n'''[[Shrieking hag]]''' : A variety of hag from [[Rashemen]], shrieking hags had an ear-piercing scream, and roamed desolate wastelands spreading deception, mischief, and chaos. Spiteful and easily angered, they were known to burst into a series of maddening wails if their trickery was resisted.\n\n'''[[Silat]]''' : A variety of hag from [[Zakhara]], silat were a strange subrace known for their unpredictably. Leaning more towards [[chaos]] than evil, some were known to be benevolent and kind if approached in whatever manner they deemed \"proper\"."

        "History": {
            "Cegilune": "As the story went, when the world was young and dark, many terrors lurked in the shadows. and so the fearful races sought protection from that which went bump in the night. In response to these prayers, the moon came into existence, and with it a queen to command the light, Cegilune. Cegilune was a silver-haired beauty whose worship spread across the world and who received constant attempts to court her favor. She adopted the most pious and pleasing priestesses as her daughters and granted them powers they were to use to grant her greater status. Her prophets were given the ability to walk on water so as to spread her good word, the songs of Cegilune bestowed beautiful voices to allure others into service and her protectors the strength to protect other worshipers from harm. In her glory days she was feared and wondered, but success breeds complacency and complacency breeds failure.\n\nCegilune's flaws were already evident as early as when she first appeared. Despite her beauty, she was as mercurial as the moon itself, and she chose her followers partially based on how much the beauty of their forms reminded her of her own. Eventually, she began growing indolent and uncaring, gluttonously partaking in worship while giving little to her followers in return. As new deities began to emerge, all but her adopted daughters left, the rest having bitterly left her in favor of adopting new patrons while mocking the aloof moon goddess. Cegilune was unaware of her waning adoration until her eternal beauty was ended by her first wrinkle. Her good sense eclipsed by anger, Cegilune went on a killing spree, murdering hundreds of her former followers while the children of the moon went on a bloody crusade.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = 350px\n| source = Elizabeth B. Soot from \"A Brush with Evil: On Hags\"\n| text   = And so I rescind my previous guides to dealing with a hag, my suggestions for clever language and deceit. Instead I offer these words should you ever encounter a hag: run. And pray she does not follow.\n}}\n\nThough this time was horrible, it was merely a phase; Cegilune's hateful response proved unwise as her younger rivals had far more collective worshipers then she did, and those that weren't killed were driven to the dark wilderness of the world. Cegilune herself was left weakened by her tantrum, for even having hoarded her power, the fit left her exhausted and ruined her beauty, leaving her a pale reflection of herself and forcing her too to flee to the deepest, loneliest crater in existence. Her followers found themselves twisted by the malevolence infused in what once was her blessings, her water-walking prophets becoming sea hags, sweet-voiced songs becoming green hags, and powerful protectors becoming annis hags. In more recent times, the hags, still beings of darkness driven by ancient spite, schemed to bring suffering to mortals. The moon goddess herself, now only full of hate, fostered her remaining divinity to bring ruin to the mortal races she saw as traitors and to extinguish the risen stars, in her opinion the impostor gods of the night, that took her place."
