Sword spiders were native to the [[Mhair Jungles]]. They were introduced by [[drow]] traders into the [[Underdark]], where they were kept and controlled by [[Lolth]]-worshiping drow as soldiers.

By the late-14{{th}} century DR, these creatures could be found in caves within [[Neverwinter Wood]], where they lived alongside [[ettercap]]s.
