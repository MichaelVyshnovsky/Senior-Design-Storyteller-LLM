Nothing else touches them - not grief, or mercy. Or any sense of what is just.''|[[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]]}}<br/>",
        "Description": "[[File:Vampire anatomy.png|thumb|''A slice of vampire anatomy – eyes and fangs.''|325x325px]]\nFor the most part, a vampire retained the appearance they had in life. The main differences were their pale skin tone and sharp, feral features, giving them a predatory aspect. Whatever their eye color was in life, after transformation, vampires' eyes changed to a red color that was hard to forget. Their hands ended in sharp, glassy claws.\n\nThey did not cast shadows, had no reflections in [[mirror]]s, and moved in complete silence.",
        "Personality": "{{quote|''There's something so pure about a vampire's evil, so perfect in its utter corruption... It'll tear at your throat like a ravenous beast, then smile at your companions as it dabs its blood-soaked lips with a silk napkin.''|Terevan of [[Nerath]]}}<br/>\nVampires enjoyed finer things in unlife and engaged in decadent behavior, often sharing such habits with [[lich]]es. A vampire was always a creature of evil. If they were not evil in life, they became so in undeath, whether they retained the memories of their mortal existence or not. Whatever attachments and affection they had towards things from their life, all were changed and corrupted by the transformation. Love was flipped to obsession, and the feelings of friendship were made into feelings of jealousy. Many vampires became obsessed and fixated on things they desired in the past – those who once sought love became predators searching for beauty in their victims, and those who valued youth could fixate on children, snuffing out the future potential of mortals at the very beginning of their journeys. These obsessions extended to possessions, as many vampires delved into collecting art, acquiring terrifying implements of torture, or decorating their lairs with trophies.\n\nBeing highly intelligent and ageless creatures, vampires forged their plans meticulously and advanced the schemes slowly, sometimes taking decades to take steps toward their goals. Vampires felt no need to rush as they could outlive their mortal enemies and spend decades or centuries planning revenge.",

If exposed directly to the light created by the sun, they would start hurting instantly and would eventually burn to ash if they did not hide in the shadows. Additionally, they could not spend more than a moment in running water without being injured.\n\nVampires were permanently bound to their coffins and the earth, corrupted by their burial.\n\nLastly, they could not enter any residence without an explicit invitation of the beings inhabiting it."
        },
        "Combat": "When forced into combat, vampires could easily fight unarmed, using their great strength to slam, rend, punch, and bite. All these physical unarmed attacks were as powerful as [[enchanted]] weapons. They did not hesitate to use their ability to dominate the opponents. On top of that, vampires could use all the skills and battle strategies they utilized in life. A vampire's bite attack resulted in the creature draining their opponent's blood. And once per day, they could use the ability to summon swarms of vermin into battle.",

            "Lairs": "Some vampires chose defensible locations of grandeur as their lairs, frequently such places as castles, manses, or other fortified structures. Oftentimes, vampires felt a strong attachment to locations soaked in tragedy, like graves of those who perished via suicide or a site of murder. Their most important possession – the coffin with the burial dirt, was often well hidden underground or within deviously trapped and guarded vaults. Lairs of especially powerful vampires spread corruption onto the land surrounding it, attracting an unnaturally high population of vermin, causing plantlife to wither and turn into thinned brambles within {{SI|500'|'\"|long=yes}}, coating the areas in clinging fog, and causing the shadows within the territory twist and extend making them appear sinister as if they moved on their own. This corruption lifted between two and twelve days after the vampire's destruction."

            "Creation": "A new vampire was created when another vampire drained the life out of a living creature. A [[humanoid]], a [[monstrous humanoid]], a [[giant]], or even a [[dragon]], among others, could become a vampire. This was different for lesser creatures; for example, when a vampire drained a [[flying snake]], it had a chance of being raised as a [[deathfang]]. Only those drained victims who were buried actually transformed into the undead.\n\nRarely encountered creatures, known as [[half-vampire]]s,{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230619061514/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_070809-05.htm| title = So Saith Ed Jul – Sep 2006| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} could be created in one of two ways. First, in some rare cases, a vampire could consume enough blood that it could breed with a humanoid or monstrous humanoid, creating half-vampire offspring. Second, in even rarer cases, if a pregnant mother survived having her blood drained by a vampire, her unborn could be \"tainted\" with vampirism instead.\n\nOn at least one occasion, a dying [[hill giant]] [[shaman]] of the [[Kryptgarden Forest]] was granted vampirism by [[Grolantor]], to whom [[Morg]], the wounded giant, addressed pleas for strength.{{Cite dragon/236/Children of the Night|80}}\n\nVampires could also be created by [[enchanted]] items, such as the ''[[Bloodvein]]'' – a ''[[curse]]d'' evil vampiric [[sword]] that fed on the blood of creatures it wounded. If the weapon's wielder died, ''Bloodvein'' brought them back to life at a permanent cost of their constitution. If the last of the wielder's constitution was drained with a resurrection, the sword brought them back as a vampire, bound to the sword and its hunger until the vampire was permanently destroyed.{{Cite organized play/LC/Heart of Mohammed|20}}",
            "Usages": "Vampire dust, left after the creature was slain, was a valuable [[spell component]].

Vampire ichor, in turn, was used as the material component for the casting of the ''[[deathbolt]]'' spell, while a bit of vampire's bone can be used to cast the ''[[undead summoning IV]]'', ''[[undead summoning V]]'', ''[[undead summoning VI]]'', and ''[[undead summoning VII]]'' spells.\n\nVampire dust was used in a similar manner in [[alchemy]]. It was an ingredient in brewing ''[[potions of gaseous form]]'' and ''[[potions of human control]].''{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|40}}\n\nVampire blood, in a certain complaint of other monster fluids, such as [[troll]]s, could be magically transferred into a humanoid to grant them regenerative abilities.

In a similar fashion, those humanoids who wished to achieve [[lich]]dom had to gather a quart of vampire's blood or blood of a person infected with vampirism.

        "History": "[[Orlak]], the Night King, a prominent vampire, took over the city of [[Westgate]] in the {{YearlinkName|-286}} and remained on its throne for more than a century until his death at the hands of [[paladin]] [[Gen Soleilon]]. Orlak's vampire minions retreated into the deep catacombs under Westgate, the so-called [[Undergate]]. There, the vampires elected a new Night King to reign over Westgate's shadowy underbelly. The title continued being passed along from one individual to the next until the late 14{{th}} century DR, if not later.\n\nSometime during his reign as the [[Magister]] of [[Mystra]], between the {{YearlinkName|326}} and the {{YearlinkName|337}}, [[Gelthin Hornreach]] stroke a deal with a vampire who resided in a nearby crypt somewhere on the [[Sword Coast North]]. The Magister used his spell-illusions to lure adventurers and treasure expeditions into the vampire's hands.\n\nVampires were the force that ended the existence of a pastoral community of [[Merrydale]] in the [[Dalelands]]. An infestation covered that area in blood, forcing family members to kill their relatives affected by vampirism. After the tragic event, locals could not call the region Merrydale, resulting in it being renamed to [[Daggerdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|796}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, a powerful vampire took residence in the [[Valhingen Graveyard]] in the monster-infected city of [[Phlan]]. The creature and his undead minions attacked one of the [[Heroes of Phlan]] – [[Tarl Desanea]], killing his [[cleric]] companions and gravely injuring his mentor, [[Anton]]. The undead stole the holy relic, the ''[[Hammer of Tyr]]''. Subsequently, Tarl and his companions [[Ren o' the Blade]] and [[Shal Bal]] challenged the undead of the Valhingen Graveyard, presumably slaying the vampire and reclaiming the stolen artifact.\n\nThe [[Skull Crag Keep]] in the [[Storm Horns]] once belonged to a vampire couple, aged around 1200 by the 1360s DR. [[Khulzond]] and his consort [[Mordroka]] were forced out and the keep taken by [[Cormyr]]'s [[Purple Knight]]s who later established the [[Roadwarden Guard]] operating out of the keep. Both vampires survived, swore vengeance, and returned in the 1360s [[DR]]. The vampires slew and turned [[Vidruand Starbrow]], a hero of the keep, who, in turn, killed [[Arelin Starbrow]] – his mother. When the crime was uncovered, Arelin's children and a group of caravan guard heroes foiled the vampires' ploy.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, vampire activity was reported in the ruins of the city of [[Dajaan]] on the [[Deepwash]] lake.\n\nVampires once again rose to prominence in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. The [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Athkatla]] faced a new thieves guild that seemingly appeared out of nowhere and poached many of their numbers, sparking a bloody guild war in the city's shady underbelly. The new guild was a vampire coven led by [[Bodhi]], a ruthless vampire sister of [[archmage]] [[Jon Irenicus]] who was aiding him in gaining god-like powers, bringing her in conflict with the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions.\n\nA court case of some notoriety involving vampires took place in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR. [[DMHOC]], an equal opportunity employer, faced legal action from the city zoning board, overseen by Magistrate [[Justin Valerius]]. The city refused to allow DMHOC's operations whilst employing sentient undead. DMHOC's points were made to present this as discrimination, and the city zoning board simply refuted it by saying that these employees were evil, bloodsucking creatures that should not be allowed on the streets of the Bluff.{{Cite polyhedron/109/The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter|5}}\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, vampire attacks began plaguing Westgate's merchants and nobles. The threat came from the notorious [[Night Masks]] guild that was taken over by some vampire [[wizard]] and some members of the guild were changed into bloodsucking monsters to strike at the guild's enemies. During the same year, rumors began spreading of the [[hobgoblin]]s of the [[Gray Forest]] gaining a new leader, a vampire of a [[werewolf]] by some accounts, aided in their attacks on local by [[dire wolves]]. Another notable vampire activity of [[1372 DR]] took place in the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]] during the time the [[Wailing Death]] ravaged [[Neverwinter]]. The drow priest of [[Vhaeraun]] turned vampire named [[Sieronius Dethick]], who was trapped under the hamlet by [[Sunder Halyndliam]], began haunting the village, draining blood from its inhabitants at night. He planned on finding a bride to drain and raise as a fellow vampire. One way or another, the haunting was ended with help from the [[Hero of Daggerford]].\n\nThe {{YearlinkName|1373}} was the year when the [[Bandit Wastes]] in [[Halruaa]] were roamed by a band of savage dire [[weremole]] [[gnome]]s called the [[Blood Screamers]], led by the [[Blood-Curdling Scream]], a [[rock gnome]] vampire [[illusionist]].\n\n[[File:Astarion cazador ritual.jpg|thumb|''[[Cazador Szarr]]'s ritual in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the [[Absolute crisis]].''|252x252px]]\n''Circa''  the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Baronies of [[Erlkazar]] were plagued by the vampire menace – the bloodsucking thralls of the [[Night Barony]]. The Barony's vampires infiltrated as far as the city of [[Riatavin]] and actively sought to be exterminated by Riatavin's [[Chosen Council]]. During the same period of time, the [[Old Vaelan]] hid a sizable population of the undead and lycanthropes under the command of the vampire lord [[Saed]]. Another place where vampires gained power at the time was the Black Network – [[Zhentarim]], taken over by Orbakh, who claimed Manshoon's name and establishing vampire lords as the organization's primary leaders.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an elvish or half-elven vampire lord from [[Kozakura]], [[Cazador]] attempted to perform a ritual granted to him by [[Mephistopheles]], transforming himself into a powerful form of a vampire ascendant – removing all undead weaknesses from the vampire and giving him back pleasures of the living. The preparation for the ritual took two centuries. Cazador's favored vampire spawn, the number that included [[Astarion Ancunín]], a member of the [[Absolute Adversaries]], collected countless victims for their master, turning them all into spawn who were to be sacrificed to empower the vampire at the center of the ritual. During the [[Absolute crisis]], the ritual was initiated. However, its outcome nor Cazador's fate were recorded.",

When a steak was bloodied with the vampire's blood, it sprouted tendrils, eventually growing into the first Gulthias tree.\n*Some believed that the enchanted ''[[arrows of the vampire]]'' were made using teeth of actual vampires.
