The '''Nars''' was a breed of [[horse|heavy horse]] commonly found throughout the lands of [[North Faer没n|northern]] and [[northeast Faer没n]]. It was popular among both the nobility and common-folk of [[Impiltur]], [[Rashemen]] as well as the [[Cold Lands]] and was a principle specimen among the horse markets of [[Nathoud]].

==Description==
Rather strong and large of frame, the Nars was capable of pulling a sled or carriage that otherwise required two horses. Despite its imposing size, it had a surprisingly quick gait.

The Nars had a good disposition and was not easily spooked or startled.
