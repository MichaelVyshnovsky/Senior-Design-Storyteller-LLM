The Nars was a breed of heavy horse commonly found throughout the lands of northern and northeast Faer√ªn. It was popular among both the nobility and common-folk of Impiltur, Rashemen as well as the Cold Lands and was a principle specimen among the horse markets of Nathoud.
Rather strong and large of frame, the Nars was capable of pulling a sled or carriage that otherwise required two horses. Despite its imposing size, it had a surprisingly quick gait.
The Nars had a good disposition and was not easily spooked or startled.
