        "Description": "Star spawn came in a variety of shapes and sizes, though many took on [[humanoid]] forms.",
        "Personality": "Star spawn were self-interested creatures, with their sole motivation being to fulfill the interests of the star spawn it represented. This often involved seeking to cause chaos and destruction.",
        "Types of Star Spawn": "[[File:Serpent of Nihal and emissary of Caiphon 4e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''An emissary of Caiphon and a serpent of Nihal.'']]\n* [[Star spawn grue]]\n* [[Star spawn hulk]]\n* [[Star spawn larva mage]], a type of star spawn that resulted from the emissary of an Elder Evil merging with the body of a powerful cultist of some wormlike entity, such as [[Kezef]] or [[Kyuss]].\n* [[Star spawn mangler]], a type of star spawn often summoned by cultists to act as assassins or guards.\n* [[Star spawn seer]]\n\nOther star spawn were tied to specific [[Elder evil#Far Realm-infested Stars|elder evils]] that infested stars in [[Realmspace]]. These included:\n\n*[[Herald of Hadar|Heralds of Hadar]] were avatars of a dying star, horrific monsters that grew stronger around living creatures because they ate life energy to channel back to [[Hadar|their creator]].\n*[[Maw of Acamar|Maws of Acamar]] were the hunger of that dead star made manifest, creatures of devastation that entered the world when [[Acamar]]'s influence was at its peak.\n*[[Scion of Gibbeth|Scions of Gibbeth]] were shards of that monstrous green shard. All reports of their form conflicted with all others, as if even trying to see its true form brought on hallucinations. Insane cultists were drawn to these star spawn, who entered the world when the star [[Gibbeth]] was in conjunction with [[Allabar]].\n*[[Spawn of Ulban]] were cunning star spawn that gathered minions around themselves and confused people's ability to tell friend from foe.\n*[[Emissary of Caiphon|Emissaries of Caiphon]] were star spawn who disguised themselves as humanoids and came to famine or plague-beset villages in the guise of a stranger who offered a cure but only ended up causing trouble. They were sent by the star [[Caiphon]], who grew brighter in times of hardship and listened to the desperate pleas of mortals.\n*[[Serpent of Nihal|Serpent of Nihal]] were infamous creatures that had long plagued the world after cultists opened a portal to [[Nihal]] itself.\n\nAdditionally, the living planet [[Allabar]], called the Opener of the Way, was sometimes considered a star spawn as well, although it was far more powerful than the spawn merely sent by stars.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Star spawn sent into the Prime Material sometimes had cults form around them, whose members they would either devour or tolerate and use as allies. The role of leadership over an Elder Evils cult was typically taken up by star spawn seers. In addition, warlocks with Elder Evil pacts often flocked to them for a variety of purposes &mdash; to serve, to study, or even to slay.\n\nOccasionally a lone or small group of [[mindflayer]]s would work with a star spawn.<ref> Other creatures they often found allies in included [[aboleth]]s, [[beholder]]s, [[demon]]s, [[elemental]]s, and [[undead]]. Acting either as the leader or servant of such creatures. Regardless of which station they took, held no allegiance towards them."

        "Rumors & Legends": "Star spawn were often said to be found following the passing of a comet, prior to a great disaster, or during a battle between two divine beings. Whether the passing of a comet heralded their arrival or simply signaled that a star spawn was nearby was a matter of speculation.",
        "Trivia": "The [[aberrant]] spirit summoned by the [[spell]] ''[[summon aberration]]'' could take the form of a star spawn.<ref>"
