        "mainbody": "Fire titans were a more powerful form of fire giant.\nFire titans typically preferred to get up close to their opponents and attack with flaming greatswords. When the opportunity to attack from a distance presented itself, they would often hurl lava at their opponent.\nThey were often known to enslave azers and employ fire archons as bodyguards.\nThey were occasionally known to fight alongside phoenixes.\nSome fire titans were known to live in the City of Brass.\nSome fire titans were known to serve the evil archomental Imix.\nThe queen of Maerimydra after the Spellplague was a fire titan named Hledh Hellspawn, although later scholars described her instead as a fiendish fire giant.\nRumors also spoke of felljaws, dragonspawn presumed to have descended from a mixing of black dragons and fire titans. Felljaws inhabited the Underdark of Returned Abeir."
