        "mainbody": "ehemoths were a rare, monstrous relative of the hippopotamus.\nBehemoths largely resembled a hippo, but their mouths had two large outward-pointing tusks that projected from each side of their mouth. These were primarily used for uprooting aquatic plants and roots.\nThese creatures had a basic animal level of intelligence.\nMale behemoths were typically aggressive, while females were only known to be aggressive when in the company of their calves. They were liable to attack boats or canoes that entered their territory, rising up from under them and making the craft flip over.\nBehemoths traveled within water by sinking their bodies and running along the river or lakes submerged ground. They were capable of remaining submerged for up to thirty minutes.\nBehemoths were known to inhabit deep rivers and lakes in tropical regions.\nIn the Realms they could be found in the rivers of Chult and in Kara-Turs tropical and subtropical forests, swamps, and bodies of freshwater. Such as the Akari island."
