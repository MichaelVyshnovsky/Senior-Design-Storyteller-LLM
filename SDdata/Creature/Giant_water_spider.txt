'''Giant water spiders''', also known as '''monstrous diving spiders''', were a common species of [[monstrous spider]] that were adapted to living in aquatic environments.

==Description==
These spiders in a wide variety of sizes, similar those of ordinary monstrous spiders, but generally tended to be smaller. One of the more average sizes for them was around {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
Giant water spiders possessed a slight degree of intelligence. Because of this, creatures such as [[nixie]]s were sometimes known to establish relations with them, often by means of offering food. But like any spider, they were liable to attack any creature that disturbed their home.

==Abilities==
These creatures possessed a powerful [[poison]]ous bite. Their bodies were well adapted for running across all vegetative and mineral surfaces underwater, as well as swimming. They also possessed a sort of [[tremorsense]], allowing them to detect and pinpoint other creatures within water.

Unlike other spiders, these creatures could not nets of webbing to use against their foes and their spidersilk lacked the sticky quality found in other species.

==Sub-Species==
;[[Giant marine spider]]s: A rare species of water spider that was larger than others and found only in saltwater environments.

==Ecology==
===Lairs===
Giant water spiders would build large nests, either in a burrow amidst underwater vegetation or with [[spidersilk]], that acted as a pocket of air. Any prey that was caught while out hunting would be dragged back to this lair, where they could safely cocoon them for later digestion.

===Habitats===
These creatures were only known to inhabit freshwater lakes, though a rarely encountered sub-species lived in saltwater habitats. 

In particular, giant water spiders were known to occasionally be found in the lakes of [[Cormanthor]], the neighboring [[Moonsea]] region's [[Moonsea (lake)|lake of the same name]], the [[River Ashaba]], [[Dragon Reach]],<ref> and the [[Marsh of Chelimber]]. Beneath the cold plains and [[Galena Mountains]] of the [[Vaasa]] region, they inhabited an [[Underdark]] cavern sacred to [[Kiaransalee]] known as the [[Vault of Gnashing Teeth]].

Following the [[Spellplague]], giant water spiders could be found in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

In the region of [[Kara-tur]] these creatures could be found in its tropical and sub-tropical oceans, temperate swamps, and temperate bodies of water. Such as the rivers on [[Akari|Akari island]].
