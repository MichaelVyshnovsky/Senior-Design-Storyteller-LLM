'''Song dragons''', also known as '''"weredragons"'''{{Cite web/Ecology of the Dragonborn|19}}, were a type of [[dragon]]. They lived among [[human]]ity in the guise of [[human]] women.

{{quote|It's natural, particularly for song dragons. We differ from the rest of our kind in a number of ways, and one is that we're particularly at home in human guise. We spend the majority of our time that way. We have a legend that our earliest ancestors were entirely [[human]], until a god blessed them with the power to transform.|[[Karasendrieth]] the Song Dragon}}

==Description==
Song dragons resembled [[copper dragon]]s in general shape, but they were more slender and possessed iridescent silver-blue scales. This made them bright and impressive in appearance. Some song dragons appeared not to have wings and instead flew using a magical organ located in their brains.

A song dragon possessed a unique alternative form, that of an attractive [[human]] woman aged between 20 and 30 years old

==Abilities==
Song dragons could use a magical ability, similar to ''[[polymorph self]]'', at will to adopt the form of a human woman. Each dragon had only a single unique human form. The change took a dozen seconds to adopt human form, and half that to change back, but rendered the song dragon immobile. It destroyed clothing, bonds and anything else confining the song dragon or human.

In human form, they lacked the dragon's physical traits and breath weapon. Regardless of form, they maintained full knowledge and awareness, and could use all their magical spells and abilities.

A song dragon had the innate ability to speak any language as with the ''[[tongues]]'' spell. It also had continuous ''[[true seeing]]''. Depending on age, a song dragon could also cast the spells ''[[light]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[blink]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', and ''[[teleport]]''. It also cast the spells of a [[cleric]] and the [[Healing domain|Healing]], [[Travel domain|Travel]], and [[Trickery domain]]s as arcane spells. Older song dragons, and those who reach the great wyrm stage of life, could use their innate magical abilities to cast ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', ''[[reverse gravity]]'', and ''[[polymorph any object]]''. A song dragon could bestow effects of these spells via a simple touch.

Song dragons possessed immunity to [[poison]]s and electricity. They could see as if under the effect of the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell and it improved with the wyrm's age.{{Cite dragon/134/The Dragon's Bestiary: Dragons of earth, sea, and space|11-12}}

These wyrms never really slept and consumed great amounts of food (anything organic, including carrion) without gaining weight in their human shape.

==Personality==

Song dragons eschewed the company of other dragons, choosing instead to live amongst humankind, aided by their alternate forms as young human women. Many were also talented [[actor]]s. This made it extremely difficult to tell them apart from actual humans. They would reveal their real identities only when in great danger.

Many song dragons enjoyed seducing evil men while in their maiden forms, eventually marrying them, in order to slay the villains, revealing the true dragon form. These marriages often left song wyrms with amassed treasures and unlike other dragons, they enjoyed gaining treasures, not hoarding them.

They sought to protect and preserve the environment. To this end, they usually worked with or served the [[Harpers]], good [[mage]]s, and other people and organizations of similar inclinations.

However, to human civilization, they were rare and surrounded in mystery.

Music was the intrinsic part of song dragons personalities, just like pranks and jokes were among [[copper dragon]]. Song dragons were also known for their independence and lacking inclinations to acknowledge anyone's authority over them.

==Combat==
A song dragon could breathe a cone of electric gas at its foes, sometimes reaching the length of {{SI|70'|'"|long=yes}} and width of {{SI|25'|'"|long=yes}}. The exuded gas was blue in color and could ''[[silence]]'' creatures in its way, snuffed out mundane and magical flames, prevented discharge of fire, heat, electricity, and dispelled ''[[illusion]]s''. The gas created by song dragons' breath remained in place for up to 4 minutes and was unaffected by normal or magical wind.

In battle, they fought with their sharp claws as dragons or slashing blades as humans. They attacked quickly and without mercy. The dragons' back claws were just as deadly as their front paws, making flanking just as dangerous as facing these beasts face to face. Song dragons could deal devastating harm when they punched from up above, rending the target with all four clawed limbs. They often sang joyfully as they fought, unless silence was wiser.

==Society==
===Homelands===
Song dragons, along this their cousins - metallic dragons, were known to inhabit the [[Galena Mountains]], [[Cold Lands]] of the [[Moonsea]] region.

They dwelt throughout the lands of the Realms but were most common in the [[Moonshae Isles]], leading some scholars to speculate that they may have originated there.

===Relationships===
Song dragons were known to sometimes act as [[favored monster|agents]] of [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Selûne]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10,14}}

The [[blue dragon]] [[Olothontor]], also known as the "The Minstrel Wyrm", was known to pursue song dragons' affections because of his obsession with fine music. However, these efforts were always in vain as the good-natured wyrms found him repulsive.{{cite book/Dragons of Faerûn|29}}

Song dragons of Waterdeep were allied with the [[Confluence]], the organization who sought out and opposed dire plots and threats posed by creatures like [[Doppelganger|doppelgangers]] and [[lycanthrope]]s against the city of Waterdeep.{{cite book/Dragons of Faerûn|94}}

===Usages===
*''[[Sonorous Scale]]'' was a magical item crafted using the scale of a song dragon. The scale was patterned with gems and metals and was enchanted as shapeshifting piece of jewelry, a protective item, and a theft deterrent.{{Cite dragon/308/Dweomered: Dragon Scales|41}}

==History==
The prevalence of song dragons in the Moonshae Isles caused some researchers to theorize that they originated there.

[[Essembramaerytha]], as "Essembra", was a famous adventuress of the [[Dalelands]] in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. The town of [[Essembra]] in [[Battledale]] was named for her, standing on the spot where she was supposedly born.{{cite book/Dragons of Faerûn|97}}

Once, a pair of accidental sightings of women transforming into song dragons triggered a panic, as rumors spread that evil mages were turning their enemies into dragons.

One notable song dragon, [[Ammaratha Cyndusk]], adopted the pseudonym Maerjanthra Shalace. She was so skilled at portraying a human that she fooled [[Elminster]]. He eventually had a [[Narnra Shalace|child]] with her, and only found out that Ammaratha was a dragon well after the daughter was fully grown.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|61-71|44}}

In [[1339 DR]], [[Taraunramorlamurla]], also known as the Keeper of Secrets, revealed her song dragon identity to [[Mirt]] the Moneylender and [[Durnan]], two of the masked [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. Taunamorla informed them that she arrived at Waterdeep ''circa'' 1350 DR, at the behest of the elders of her kin. She was to handle a problem of draconic nature and decided to stay in the city, falling in love with its pace and inhabitants. Since her arrival, the song dragon acted as a guide and contact person for the dragons who lived in Waterdeep in humanoid guise, she protected and subtly influenced the masked Lords. She also revealed that the benevolent dragons, including song dragons had a hand in crafting ''[[Ahghairon's dragonward]]'', allowing certain wyrms to dwell freely in the guise of mortals of Waterdeep.

[[Karasendrieth]], a song dragon of [[Impiltur]] who attempted to stop [[Sammaster]]'s [[Rage of Dragons]] in [[1373 DR]]. The song dragon and her allied succeeded curing the rage and gaining renown and recognition.

''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], [[Serenescales]] of Waterdeep sought out adventurers to visit the Moonshae Islands and bring back to her a lone and rare male song dragon.

The city of [[Waterdeep]] was warded against dragons via ''Ahghairon's dragonward'' that seeped the wyrms' strength, preventing them from harming the City of Splendors. Shortly after the first wave of ''[[Spellplague]]'' the ''[[gorget of the Songdragon]]'' was [[enchanted]] to shield a song dragon from being affected by the ''dragonward''. Despite the unstable magics of the time, the ''gorget'' remained unaffected and functioning post ''Spellplague''. Eventually, the ''gorget of the Songdragon'' ended up in possession of [[Rhinzen Halnian]], and later - stolen by [[Tennora Hedare]].

==Notable Song Dragons==
===Organizations===
*[[Sisterhood of Essembra]], a small and secretive sisterhood of [[half-dragon|half-song dragons]] who lived in [[Battledale]].

===Individuals===
*[[Alrue Crownshield]], a song dragon who posed as an ordinary human shop girl at the [[Wyrmworks]] of [[Silverymoon]].{{Cite dragon/322/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Wyrmworks|85}}
*[[Ammaratha Cyndusk]], a [[Cormyrean]] song dragon mother of the [[half-dragon]] daughter of [[Elminster Aumar]] - [[Narnra Shalace]].
*[[Araemra]], or "Longtalons", a young song dragon ally of Serenescales's.{{cite book/Dragons of Faerûn|35}}
*[[Essembramaerytha]], also known as the legendary adventurer Essembra, was an old song dragon wyrm by [[1374 DR]].
*[[Faelrae Garthammus]], a mature female song dragon of [[Hawkgarth]], the [[Border Kingdoms]].
*[[Ilden Garthammus]], one of the elusive male song dragons who resided in Hawkgarth.
*[[Karasendrieth]], a female song dragon who lived in Impiltur ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].
*[[Meliordianix]], the matriarch of the song dragon family of Relkath's Foot.
*[[Taraunramorlamurla]], or "Serenescales", "Taunamorla Esmurla", or "Keeper of Secrets" of Waterdeep.

==Rumors & Legends==
*Song dragons were commonly mistaken for metallic dragons due to their benign nature and rarity.
*Another common misnomer is when song dragons were referred to as "weredragons." Unlike actual [[weredragon]]-[[lycanthrope]]s, song dragons were true dragons, their bite did not spread lycanthropy, nor could they be "cured" from the draconic "affliction."
*One popular legend among song dragons claimed that they were once humans until they received a blessing from the gods, transforming them into the creatures known as song dragons.
