        "mainbody": "Galltrits were a winged species of gremlin.\nGalltrits on average grew to be  tall. Their bodies had stony grey skin. They were often very hard to detect.\nGalltrits had an average level of intelligence. They had nasty dispositions and would often attack if disturbed. If caught feeding by their prey, they would try to make a hasty retreat.\nMuch like a vampire bat, the saliva of these creatures possessed both an anesthetic and [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant anti-coagulant] properties. This made it so that the nerves and skin around where a galltrit bit became temporarily deadened, preventing their victim from feeling anything, and prolonging the period of bleeding. They would then suck blood from their victim until either full or detected.\nIn 1357 DR, galltrits could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep. And following its destruction, they could be found in the ruins of Zhentil Keep.\nMuch like the standard gremlin, galltrits traveled in packs. Some were known to carry around gems.\nGalltrits primarily subsisted upon blood.\nGalltrits could be found in a variety of habitats and climates. However, they primarily lived in areas of carrion, dung, and offal."
