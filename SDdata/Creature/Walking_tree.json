        "mainbody": "A walking tree was a mindless plant creature that attacked with its wooden appendages.\nUnlike treants, walking trees were entirely non-intelligent, and only obeyed the will of their masters.\nThe attacks of walking trees were highly damaging, but they were very slow. These creatures were immune to becoming confused and were naturally well armored.\nIn the 14 century DR, the Cult of Moander joined forces with Tanetal and and the mage, Marcus. With the powers of Moander, they were able to animate walking trees, and the power was given to many trees of the Elven Court."
