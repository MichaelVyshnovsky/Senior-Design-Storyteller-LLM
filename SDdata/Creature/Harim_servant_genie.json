        "mainbody": "arim servant genies were special tasked genies in Zakhara who guarded harims and entertained the brides and concubines of elite citizenry.\nThese genies preferred to work for mortals, where they could feel superior and important, but they also worked for other genies performing more menial tasks.\nHarim servant genies originated as servants of the jann, working in their harims for so long that they lost the drive to perform any other functions. Noble genies who possessed harim servant genies were viewed in high status by their peers. \nMost harim servants were males who possessed tall muscular physiques, though they were usually not attractive in the face.\nHarim servants had access to a variety of spells, most of which were used to entertain and serve. They typically carried a pair of great scimitars, wielding one in each hand with ease because of their size.\nMale harim servants adopted a fatherly role toward their charges, seeking to guide and protect them. Female harim servants brought a strong sense of order to their duty. All harim servants were quick to punish those who were out of line, though they promoted a sense of family whenever they could.\nHarim servants performed a wide variety of tasks for their charges and the harim in general. They were happy with doing a good job and earning the adoration of the women of the harim. Harim servants who were mistreated or bound by their master usually became attached to the masterâ€™s women, keeping secrets and acting as a confidant.\nHarim servants had good relationships with most mortal races, particularly the women of those races. Because of the nature of their duties, harim servants were usually able to empathize with women they met outside of the harim.\nThese genies would go insane if either their harim was taken from them or it was destroyed. Both caused intense feelings of failure. Insane harim servants often became slayer genies."
