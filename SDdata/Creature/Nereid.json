        "mainbody": "Nereids were a race of aquatic fey related to the tritons. Like the nymphs who lived in the coves and streams, the dryads who lived in the trees, and the oreads who dwelt in the mountains, nereids were fey who were bound to the seas and oceans. They physically resembled tritons except that their bodies displaced light, making them nearly transparent and hard to see, especially when they were in the water.\nIn 1361 DR, a nereid ensnared Fyodor on Ruathym and almost drowned him. However, Liriel Baenre rescued him by snatching the nereids shawl and enslaving her.\nEvil nereids roamed the streets of the underwater city of Ascale. They also lived in and defended Lake Ashane in Rashemen.\nNereids were also rumored to live within the forest of Shilmista, within a pool formed from the headwaters of the River Valashar.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, nereids could be found in the Elemental Plane of Water and in Oceanus.\nNereids that lived in the region of Zakhara were known to domesticate and keep sea wyrms as pets. In other regions, nereids often kept giant otters as pets.\nSome acted as servants of the marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.\n*Ghaliyah, a nereid in Hawa who was enslaved by a cult of Istishia worshipers in 1367 DR.\n*Shoal"
