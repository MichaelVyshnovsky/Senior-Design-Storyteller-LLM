A '''vodyanoi''' ({{Pronounce|VOD|ya|noy|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}} {{Pronounce|VAD|ya|noy|refs=

==Description==
These strong creatures looked similar to umber hulks, but had slimy green skin and webbed claws at the end of both their legs and long arms. Their mandibles were so powerful they could bite through [[clam]] shells and the hides of [[shark]]s. Vodyanoi typically stood slightly taller than the standard umber hulk, in some cases growing as tall as {{SI|10|ft}}.

==Personality==
Vodyanoi were a reasonably intelligent species, though they were not profound thinkers and often bloodthirsty marauders. Complex situations were typically viewed by them in simple terms. And they typically valued physical prowess over culture or intelligence.

==Combat==
They attacked with their large and powerful claws, as well as their mandibles. Vodyanoi could summon up to a score of [[electric eel]]s to assist them in combat.

==Ecology==
Vodyanoi were largely solitary creatures, but would gather periodically with others of their kind.

More peaceful vodyanoi were typically hermits that lived in deeper waters or [[adventurer]]s.
===Habitats===
Vodyanoi were most common in deep, freshwater lakes, but were occasionally found in saltwater as well. In such waters they usually inhabited caves near the edge of a deep trench or continental shelf.

They were known to inhabit the fresh-water lakes in [[Chessenta]],
===Languages===
Vodyanoi primarily spoke a dialect of the umber hulk language, which they could speak with others of their kind over tremendous distances. Vodyanoi were also capable of learning how to speak [[Common]] and the unique languages of many undersea races, such as the [[locathah language|locathah]], [[merfolk language|merfolk]], [[sahuagin language|sahuagin]], and [[triton language|triton]] languages.{{Cite dragon/250/Heroes of the Sea|34}}
===Religions===
Some vodyanoi worshiped [[Panzuriel]] and served him as [[shaman]]s.
===Relationships===
Some vodyanoi acted as servants of the [[marid]] [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].
