'''Rheas''' were a common species of flightless birds in the Realms.

==Description==
Rheas largely resembled another common species of flightless bird, the [[ostrich]], except for three distinctions. They averaged a height of {{SI|3|ft}}, had three toes instead of two, and their tail plumage was far shorter. Long feathers on the sides of their bodies swooped down to cover their short tail plumage. Their bodies typically weighed around {{SI|80|lbs|k}}.

==Behavior==
Like many species of flightless bird, rheas were largely non-aggressive and would run away from any potential threat, being rather timid.

==Abilities==
These creatures had an acute vision.{{Cite dragon/200/Familiar Faces|32}}

==Combat==
When feeling cornered, these birds would peck at the potential threat.

==History==
Back in the age of [[Netheril]], herds of rhea could be found in [[north Faer√ªn]] migrating through the [[Eastern Forest]].<ref>

==Ecology==
These birds often gathered in flocks of three to six individuals, though during mating season this number could go as high as twenty five.
===Diet===
Rheas were a herbivorous species.
===Habitats===
Rheas were typically found in plains, open grasslands, of regions with a warm or subtropical climate.
===Relationships===
Some creatures were known to hunt wild rheas, while others raised them in farms.
===Usage===
A number of fashion designers in the Realms sought out the unusual feathers of rheas.

==Trivia==
Rheas could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' [[spell]].<ref>
