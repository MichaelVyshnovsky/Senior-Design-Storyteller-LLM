Con-tinh were a race of lesser spirits greatly feared in Kara-Tur, who were formed when a young woman died early in life.
Con-tinh were beautiful humanoid women who wore elegant silk robes, the clothing of princesses. They often carried a large fan and/or a basket of fruit. Occasionally, she was seen with her familiars, often cranes or light-blue doves.
The laugh of a con-tinh could drive a listener to madness.
Once a night,  a con-tinh had the ability to possess the body of a nearby humanoid. The possession was only in effect within  from her tree.
It was not possible for a con-tinh to pass through jade or crystal, nor could it pick up items made from these materials.
The singular purpose of a con-tinh was to destroy all life. She was especially obsessed with killing members of her former race. A con-tinh attacked with her evil laugh, up to three times a night. A con-tinh would send her familiars to scout for potential victims, who mistook the familiars as a good omen and then were lured to the con-tinhs tree. 
Only strong weapons were able to harm a con-tinh. Her tree was her main weak spot any attack, including magical attacks, on her tree would cause damage to the con-tinh. Spells such as wood rot would destroy both the tree and the con-tinh. There was still a risk in attacking a con-tinhs tree, as the humanoid who destroyed her tree had a chance of suffering an ancient curse spell.
The Celestial Bureaucracy created a con-tinh from the spirit of a young woman who died as a result of a wrong-doing. For example, a woman who was murdered by a jealous spouse. 
Con-tinh were often created as a result of an adulterous love affair ending in a maidens murder.
Like many Kara-Turan spirits, the life-force of a con-tinh was connected to a specific tree. A con-tinh was unable to venture farther than  from her tree. If the con-tinhs tree was destroyed in any way, she was also instantly destroyed.
Wu jen and shugenja collected the fruit from a con-tinhs tree, which was dried and ground into a dust to be used as a material component in a potion of longevity.
The hills near Gensuyama, a volcano in Kozakura, were home to a number of con-tinh.
* Scream, Hate, and Spite The three evil daughters of Tsien Chiang of ICath and unique forms of con-tinh created after she trapped their spirits in corrupted sacred bells, to which they were tied, rather than trees.
