        "Description": "Quickwoods largely resembled [[oak]] trees to other creatures unless within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of them or {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} if it was trying to remain hidden. What distinguished them from regular trees was a visage and sensory organs &mdash; ears, eyes, and nose &mdash; that resembled those of a distorted [[human]] face. They even had a mouth-like opening.\n\nTheir roots were capable of seizing and holding down creatures under {{SI|1000|lbs.|k}}. They were very durable and hard to damage with blunt weaponry.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Senses": "In addition to their standard roots, quickwoods had a number of smaller roots that they used to sense approaching creatures. Their leaves were also capable of detecting movement in air and changes in pressure. Their eyes were capable of seeing [[infravision|infravisually]] from up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} away."
        },
        "Combat": "The limbs of quickwoods were too stiff to be effective in combat. If a creature got close enough to their trunk they would clamp down with their mouth-like opening.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that quickwoods grew from [[mandragora]] roots that had been planted and [[item enchantment|enchanted]] by a great [[druid]] or [[wizard]] with some mighty spells.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Quickwoods were known to be found in practically any location that supported oak trees.\n\nIn [[North Faerûn]] they could be found in [[Cormanthor]], [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], and [[Sembia]]. They could also be found in parts of [[Northwest Faerûn]].<ref> In the [[Unapproachable East]], quickwoods could be found in the coastal regions of [[Rashemen]].<ref>\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], quickwoods could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].",
            "Relationships": "Other creatures sometimes ''[[charm]]ed'' or convinced quickwoods into serving as guardians of an area or repositories for treasure, placing it within their trunk orifice. When acting as guardians they would send out a hollow drumming sound upon sighting an intruder, which could be heard from over a {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} away.\n\nQuickwoods were a [[favored monster]] of the [[deity]] [[Rillifane Rallathil]]."
