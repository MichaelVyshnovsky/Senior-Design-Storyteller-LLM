'''Chu-u''', also called '''legless ghosts''', were a race of greater [[spirit]]s common to [[Kara-Tur]], who were neither wicked nor noble enough in life to be judged in the [[afterlife]].

==Description==
The upper half of a chu-u appeared as an aged human, either male or female. The bottom half of a chu-u was in a misty cloud of roughly {{SI|5|feet|c|long=yes}} in width. Its skin was green and wrinkled, and they had narrow eyes. They often appeared wearing clothing, usually red, and with a crown of thorns. 

==Combat==
Upon meeting another humanoid, a chu-u began telling the story of its life. This tale described its former life and how it became a chu-u. They pleaded with humanoids to accompany them to the [[River of Three Routes]], so they could testify on their behalf to the dreaded [[King Judge]], who sentenced and delivered punishment to spirits. Afterwards, they were returned to the [[Material Plane]]. Since the King Judge would often spend a lengthy time deliberating on the chu-u's fate, often up to 100 years, the traveler rarely, if ever, learned the outcome of their intervention. 

If they refused to aid the chu-u, the spirit became enraged and swore vengeance. It then transformed into a mist and was drawn into the ground. The vengeance of a chu-u occurred when the victim least expected it, often several years later. The chu-u transformed its arm into misty tendrils, which could be lengthened an unlimited distance, and choked their victims. This attack could be repelled by a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell. Someone who had been cursed by a chu-u was able to have the curse lifted by visiting a [[shugenja]], who performed a purification ritual. 

==Abilities==
Chu-u used ''[[ghost light]]'' to lure travelers to them. They also could drain health from a victim to strengthen themselves.

It was not possible for a chu-u to pass through [[jade]] or [[crystal]], nor could it pick items made from these materials up.

==Society==
Chu-u spent their time stuck along the shores of the River of Three Routes, unable to fully enter the [[Spirit World]]. On the Prime Material plane, they remained underground until they encountered a humanoid. 

==Ecology==
The tears of a chu-u were collected and used by [[wu jen]] and shugenja as the main component in ''[[oil of etherealness]]''.
