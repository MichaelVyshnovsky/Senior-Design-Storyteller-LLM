A slithering hoard was a very rare, enormous ooze that used treasure as an outer coat.
Slithering hoards were  long creatures that were modified gelatinous cubes. Unlike gelatinous cubes, they did not form a cubic shape, but instead appeared as a spherical lump. They carried their hoard around with them as a protective outer layer.
These creatures could swim in water, similar to an ixitxachitl, by flapping parts of their huge mass.
Unlike most oozes, which were unintelligent, these creatures possessed low intelligence. They used this to track other creatures and the treasure that they used to coat themselves. Slithering hoards took advantage of their natural camouflage and employed advanced hunting tactics. For example, they could warp their bodies to form a flat surface, appearing solely as their hoard. Opportunistic adventurers or creatures may be tempted to help themselves to the pile of items, only to find themselves surrounded by the gargantuan oozes. Similarly, they could disguise themselves by submerging themselves in water, appearing as no more than loose treasure floating along.
In combat, these oozes simply suffocated their foes and ground them with the weapons and gems that formed their outer coat. They struck with a couple of pseudopods that they could create from their amorphous body, which could paralyze their foes.
They were immune to electricity, as well as paralysis, fear, sleep, hold and polymorph spells. However, cold-based attacks could significantly slow them and decrease their damage output.
These oozes were brought into existence by Red Wizards of Thay experimenting on gelatinous cubes. They were sent to their enemies, particularly those who were rich, in ceramic jars. The jars containing the slithering hoards may then have been stashed in a collection of treasure. The slithering hoards would be able to escape, incorporating the treasure as its outer coat, and surprise the owner of the treasure.
