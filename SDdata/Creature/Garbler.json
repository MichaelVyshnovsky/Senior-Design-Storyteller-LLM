        "Description": "These masses of flesh and teeth babbled incoherently constantly.",
        "Personality": "Nominally sapient, even telepathy did not allow communication with anything beneath their madness; though they spoke, they did not understand any language. The creature lunged towards any flesh it discovered, out to feed.",
        "Abilities": "The creature moved in a disjointed manner, dragging itself along with its flowing jaws. As it gibbered, it occassionally uttered something in [[truespeak]]. It employed six such utterances: [[Utterance|defensive edge, morale boost, temporal twist, greater speed of the zephyr, spell rebirth, and preternatural clarity]], and all of them were in their \"reversed\" forms, using them to hamper foes rather than bolster allies.\n\nDespite the fact that a garbler did not understand any languages, it could effortlessly \"counterspeak\" or reverse any Truespeak utterance used in its vicinity. It had an uncanny, instinctive understanding of what was good and what wasn't, and could not be counted on to reverse a positive utterance on itself nor a negative utterance targetting an enemy. Bizarrely, a garbler found Truespeak to be no challenge whatsoever, and had no chance of erring in its utterances.\n\nBeing eyeless, it was unaffected by gaze attacks.",
        "Society": "They were solitary.",
        "History": "As of {{yearlink|1373}}, the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] had furnished themselves with a few garblers captured recently from the [[Underdark]]. This contact with truename magic made it out to be a threat, as far as they could tell."
