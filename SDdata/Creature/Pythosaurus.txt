The '''pythosaurus''', more commonly known to locals as '''Esmelda''' or the '''Monster of the Lake''', was a species of aquatic [[dinosaur]] endemic to [[Lake Esmel]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The body structure of a pythosaurus was largely similar to that of other aquatic dinosaurs, such as [[plesiosaurus]] and [[elasmosaurus]], a large central body with a long neck and large flippers. However, their heads were notably said to resemble a cross between a [[snake]] and [[dragon]], with an {{SI|8|ft}} tall rigid dorsal spine running along its neck. The description of the creature's body was fairly consistent in the stories told of it by the inhabitants of Amn, though there was often some form of inconsistency in the accounts.

Their central body was over {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} wide, while their necks ranged from lengths of {{SIrange|60|80|ft|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
Being largely unintelligent animals, the pythosaurus was just as likely to attack boats as it was sailors and other creatures. However, unless hungry or provoked, they were unlikely to be found anywhere near the surface.

==Ecology==

The pythosaurus was a largely solitary creature, only interacting with other members of their species when they needed to mate or teach their youth how to hunt. This teaching period typically lasted for only a few weeks following the youth's hatching, after which the creature would leave their offspring to fend for themselves.

===Habitats===
Due to their preference for cold water habitats, the pythosaurus generally stayed away from the western end of Lake Esmel and was more common in its eastern end.

===Relations===
Most of the inhabitants of Amn believed that the pythosaurus was merely a myth and a tool for telling tall tales at taverns. They also believed that it was but a single creature, when it reality there were around a dozen living within Lake Esmel.

==History==
The pythosaurus was created by one of the [[creator race]]s during the [[Days of Thunder]] (likely the [[sarrukh]]<ref group="note">Given the dinosaur nature of the pythosaur, the sauroid sarrukh were most likely responsible.). They had been in Lake Esmel ever since that time.
