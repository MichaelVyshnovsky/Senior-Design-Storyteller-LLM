'''Yaks''' were large herd animals used as livestock in northern regions of [[Faer√ªn]] such as the [[Spine of the World]] and the [[Hordelands]] and many elevated regions like the mighty [[Yehimal Mountains]].{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}} They were similar in many respects to [[giant ram]]s.<ref>

==Description==
Yaks were sturdy animals that moved at a slow pace and were unaffected by cold temperatures.

==History==
Sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], a village of [[Yak folk|yakfolk]] near [[Ironslag]] kept large herds of yaks.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Yaks were a herbivorous species that could survive on meagre amounts of [[grass]].
===Habitats===
Yaks were typically found in cold, mountainous regions, unable to survive in warm climates.
===Usages===
Domesticated yaks were employed for a variety of uses, such as beasts of burden and sources of [[wool]] and milk. [[Yak butter]], a soft cream [[cheese]], was a characteristic product from yak-raising regions.
