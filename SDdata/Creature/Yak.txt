Yaks were large herd animals used as livestock in northern regions of Faer√ªn such as the Spine of the World and the Hordelands and many elevated regions like the mighty Yehimal Mountains. They were similar in many respects to giant rams.
Yaks were sturdy animals that moved at a slow pace and were unaffected by cold temperatures.
Sometime after the War of the Silver Marches, a village of yakfolk near Ironslag kept large herds of yaks.
Yaks were a herbivorous species that could survive on meagre amounts of grass.
Yaks were typically found in cold, mountainous regions, unable to survive in warm climates.
Domesticated yaks were employed for a variety of uses, such as beasts of burden and sources of wool and milk. Yak butter, a soft cream cheese, was a characteristic product from yak-raising regions.
