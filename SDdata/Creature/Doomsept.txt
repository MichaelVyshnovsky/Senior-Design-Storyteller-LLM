A '''doomsept''' was a [[wraith]]-like [[undead]] creature created using the foul [[ritual]]s found in the ''[[Codex of Araunt]]''. They were bound to serve their creators, the [[Eminence of Araunt]].

==Description==
Doomsepts resembled humanoid warriors. They wielded wraith-like weapons.

==Background==
Doomsepts were created by fusing seven different spirits into one being. Each spirit provided a unique characteristic or ability to a given doomsept.

According to some legends, if the name of one of the spirits that composed a doomsept was said loud, the doomsept stopped all activity and the called spirit was compelled to answer the caller, as if under the effect of a ''[[speak with dead]]'' [[spell]]. After all answers were given, the doomsept resumed its attack, this time more viciously.

Doomsepts were mostly found protecting tombs and mausoleums across [[Laerakond]], or in the ''[[deathway]]s''.
