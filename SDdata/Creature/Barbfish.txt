A '''barbfish''' was a species of edible mud [[shark]]s that inhabited lower reaches of the [[River Specie]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The species' name was inspired by the fleshy barbs that grew on the sides of the fishes' mouths. Their skin was mud-colored, tough, and covered in a constantly secreting foul rot-smelling slime. These creatures could grow to be as large a [[horse]].

==Ecology==
Barbfish used their fleshy namesake spurs to feel through riverbed mud and into otherwise inaccessible clefts while scavenging for food. They were a lethargic and lazy species that spent most of their lives slowly gliding along the river bottom and feeding.

Despite living in river muck, these fish were known for their great taste. Barbfish flesh was eaten raw, fried, or poached in [[milk]] and [[butter]]. The skin was extremely unappealing and was always discarded. According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], barbfish was especially delectable when boiled with [[currant]]s and [[berries]].
