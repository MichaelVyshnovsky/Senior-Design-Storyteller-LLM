        "mainbody": "lague demons were fiends that were created when creatures succumbed to the abyssal plague.\nSimilar to ghoul fever, a victim infected by the abyssal plague, either through the ingestion of or contact with Voidharrow, exposure to the blood of another infected creature, or the attacks/death throes of a plague demon, could develop symptoms of the disease and transform upon their death.\nSometimes an infected creature would die before the infection of their body was complete. These creatures would still rise as plague demons, but they would be lesser, undead corpses.\nPlague demons were under the control of the Voidharrow, the sentient remains of an Abyss located in another universe. The Voidharrow desired to spread the abyssal plague across all known worlds, including Toril. These demons had the same chaotic and destructive nature of the demons from the normal Abyss.\nthumb|left|Two adventurers, a dragonborn and a tiefling, fighting against a group of plague demons.\nThere were eight known types of plague demon\n Animated corpses Formed from a creature infected by the abyssal plague who died from a cause other than the disease itself.\n Abyssal plague demons The most frequently documented carriers of the plague, usually roughly humanoid in appearance in accordance with the diseases most common victims. They were divided in six categories (from weakest to strongest) Chaos hound, Chaos Footsoldier, Chaos beast, Chaos bender, Chaos knight, and Chaos vanguard.\n Abyssal plague swarms Hive minds of tiny demonic insects spawned from orbs found near areas experiencing the plague.\n Swarmbringers Resembling spiders, swarmbringers were more intelligent and could infect the ground around them if they were killed.\n Voidharrow doomcallers Capable of infecting entire countries by itself, doomcallers communicated directly with the Voidharrow and could launch plague-filled spores into the air.\n Abyssal plague blightwalker Individuals stronger than the average person, such as adventurers, didnt turn into common plague demons, instead they were transformed into the more powerful blightwalkers.\n Voidharrow Exarchs Specially powerful heroes were transformed into Voidharrow Exarchs, champions of the Voidharrow who commanded the lesser plague demons.\n Voidharrow Heralds Specially powerful users of arcane magic were transformed into Voidharrows Heralds. They lost their magical abilities in exchange for the power of spreading the Abyssal Plague with a crystalline sword that was able to slice space itself. The Heralds were the voice and will of the Voidharrow itself.\nAt some point in the past, worshipers of Tharizdun tried to free their god from his ancient prison in Pandemonium. Heroes from the world of Nerath, among them the deva Demascus, disrupted the ritual, but not before the cultists had released the Voidharrow from Tharizduns prison. The Voidharrow infected the cultists and some of the heroes, turning them into the first plague demons, among them Murmur and Scour. They were sealed away by the remaining heroes, thought Murmur and Scour were sent to Toril through the Vast Gate.\nIn 1479 DR, plague demons were encountered in Akan√ªl, Luskan, Easting, and within the depths of Undermountain.\n* Murmur\n* Scour"
