Heroes from the world of [[Nerath]], among them the [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Demascus]], disrupted the ritual, but not before the cultists had released the Voidharrow from Tharizdun's prison. The Voidharrow infected the cultists and some of the heroes, turning them into the first plague demons, among them [[Murmur]] and [[Scour]]. They were sealed away by the remaining heroes, thought Murmur and Scour were sent to [[Toril]] through the [[Vast Gate]].\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], plague demons were encountered in [[Akan√ªl]],<ref> [[Luskan]],<ref> [[Easting (town)|Easting]],<ref> and within the depths of [[Undermountain]].",
