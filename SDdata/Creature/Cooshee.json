        "mainbody": "'''Cooshee''', also known as '''elven hounds''', were a breed of hounds that were kept by [[elves]].",
        "Description": "Cooshee were rather large dogs, almost as big as a [[pony]] with a height of {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} at the shoulder, with huge forepaws that sported long claws for a [[dog]]. They sported thick green coats of fur with brown spots. Their claws were curved, allowing them better traction in the forest grounds they typically roamed, and they had ears that pointed straight up. Their tails were of a curved nature, always held high, except when being scolded. On average they weighed around {{SIrange|168|200|lbs.|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures had a level of intellect comparable to most dogs, but they had very independent spirits and were generally distrustful of creatures that weren't elves or [[half-elves]]. They were also highly protective of their offspring.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Magical": "Much like their elven masters, cooshee had some form of magical resistance against [[enchantment]] [[spell]]s and were immune to ''[[sleep]]'' effects. They also seemed to share the elven affinity for nature."
        },
        "Combat": "[[File:Cooshee-drag67.png|thumb|250px|''A cooshee stands ready to fight.'']]\nThese creatures were quite effective fighters. When engaging someone in combat, cooshee often tried to knock them down with their large forepaws before biting at them. These bites were said to be bone-crushing, capable of felling an [[orc]] [[warrior]]. If ordered to subdue an opponent, they would simply close their jaws over the target's throat, resting their teeth against its skin.",
        "History": "It was uncertain whether cooshee were a naturally occurring species, or one that had been bred into existence by elves.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Cooshee were typically found in the same temperate, meadows and woodlands as elves.\n\nIn the nation of [[Aglarond]], these beasts could be found in the wilds of the [[Yuirwood]] forest. Beyond [[Toril]], cooshee could be found on the planet of [[Oerth]].",
            "Relationships": "Cooshee were most commonly kept by [[wild elves]] as guard or hunting dogs, though occasionally [[high elves]] also kept them. They tended to avoid the company of other species of canine.\n\nCooshee were trained as guard dogs by the [[Ulondarr]] clan of elves from [[Semberholme]].\n\nSome elven [[ranger]]s had cooshee as [[animal companion]]s. And some [[hound master]]s worked with them. They also sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[Seldarine]] deities [[Rillifane Rallathil]] and [[Solonor Thelandira]].",
            "Usages": "[[File:DDO-Cooshee Pup.jpg|thumb|250px|''A cooshee pup, as depicted in [[Dungeons & Dragons Online]].'']]\nElven hound pups could sell for around 150 [[gold piece]]s, while a fully trained adult hound could fetch at least 300 gold pieces. However, cooshee in general were rarely ever found for sale on the open market."
        },
        "Trivia": "The [[Skinwalker]]s of [[Evermeet]] were known to sometimes assume the form of cooshee as their [[totem]] animals."
