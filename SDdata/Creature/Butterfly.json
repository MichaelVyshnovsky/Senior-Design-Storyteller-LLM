        "mainbody": "'''Butterfly''' was a collective name given to a vast number of harmless winged insects, often notable for their colorful wings, and being related to [[moth]]s, found across [[Toril]].",
        "Description": {
            "Species of Butterflies": "*The [[athrogony]], a species of large colorful nocturnal butterflied that could be found in wildflower meadows of [[the Vast]]. They were attracted to magic, [[enchantment]]s, and wondrous items. The species could only breed near magic and began absorbing it immediately after landing on the said items.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stars and Moon Above|7}}\n*The [[giant butterfly]] of [[Chult]], a species used by the [[Mezro]]an as flying mounts.\n*The [[Morgan's redwing]], the most beautiful butterfly of the [[High Moor]], colored crimson red and named after the [[Morgan (druid)|man]] who saved the species from extinction."

        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "An especially aggressive species of butterflies could be found in central [[Amn]]. These sickly-white insects were heinous in appearance, with stumpy wings and long black tongues extruding from almost human-like lips. Despite their appearance and harassment of passing creatures, crawling into their clothes and under their armor, these butterflies caused no wound.\n\nButterflies were abundant on the isle of [[Moray]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the [[Shannyth Valley]], the forest of [[Cormanthor]], the [[Black Plain]] in the [[Eastern Heartlands]], the [[Forest of Tethir]], and in the verdant forest of [[Yuirwood]] in [[Aglarond]]. [[Hawk]]-sized butterflies were known to inhabit the [[High Forest]] in [[Faerûn]].\n\nThe nation of [[Rashemen]] saw very few butterflies most of the year, apart from springtime.\n\nA species of small crimson butterflies could be found in the [[Utter East]], swarming near the [[plum]] [[tree]]s that grew there. The [[Panjuis]] fortress in the [[Ama Basin]] was home to a beautiful species of butterfly that looks like a bejeweled piece of jewelry, but was a living insect. [[Sentinelspire (mountain)|Sentinelspires]] in the [[Hordelands]] were home to a species of tiny blue butterflies used by local lizards as a food source.{{Cite digital book/Sentinelspire||18}} At least one species of small and harmless butterflies inhabited the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Lion!|5}}\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], gold-specked butterflies inhabited the [[Golden Hills]] where the [[deity]] [[Garl Glittergold]] welcomed his [[petitioner]]s.",
            "Usages": "Butterfly cocoons were in demand among wizards, sold for five [[sp]] per ten cocoons through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].''\n\nMorgan's redwing butterflies were boiled to produce a red [[dye]] by the [[goblin]]s of the High Moor.\n\nThrough magic, a swarm of butterflies could be used to create a [[butterfly golem]], sometimes assembled through magic and given out during certain summer festivals in [[North Faerûn]].\n\nA living butterfly was the [[material component]] of the ''[[force shapechange]]'' [[abjuration]] [[spell]].",
            "Relationships": "Butterflies of all types were considered be the easiest types of creatures summoned through magic.\n\nButterflies were creatures important so several deities. [[Sheela Peryroyl]], [[Lathander]], and [[Lliira]] counted butterflies among their servants and favorite animals.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12-14}} [[Qotal]], a [[Maztica]]n deity also known as the Butterfly God, accepted \"sacrifice\" of butterflies that were released out of cages on the god's altars, in place of blood sacrifices practiced by [[Zaltec]]'s clergy."
        },
        "History": "[[File:Butterfly on Skull.png|thumb|''A painting depicting a butterfly perched atop a skull.''|366x366px]]\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the village of [[Dark Hollow]] in the Vast experienced a chain of strange events, including an appearance of beautiful giant glowing butterflies, born from [[mage]] [[Telemon]]'s medical experiments and incompetence of his apprentice.{{Cite organized play/LC/Something in the Water|2-3}}\n\nIn the winter of {{YearlinkName|1359}}, [[faerie dragon]] [[Zyx]] of [[Chult]] bravely stopped a wayward invasion of butterflies who lost their way in the annual migration.",
        "Cultural Relevance": "Butterflys were a somewhat common inspiration behind names of establishments, like [[Bronze Buckler and Butterfly Dance and Gambling Club]] of [[Emrys]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]].{{Cite polyhedron/119/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Throat of Talduth Vale|9}}\n\nSome weapons found in Kara-Tur were inspired by butterflies, including [[butterfly blade]]s and butterfly-tipped swords of [[Shou Lung]].\n\nButterflied inspired a number of things in various cultures. Certain ''[[spelljamming]]'' ships were designed in the shape of butterflies, including the ''[[Armada (spelljammer)|armada]]'' and ''[[flitter]]''.\n\n[[Halfling]]s had a superstition that if one stepped on a butterfly, they were ought to stay at home for three days or face misfortune.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, dusty grey butterflies were seen occasionally flying out of the well at the center of the [[Yawning Portal]] in [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite adventurers league/Once in Waterdeep|4}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that during the [[elf|elvish]] [[Retreat]], some Fair Folk nobles were seen carried by great butterflies to the isle of [[Evermeet]] in [[1344 DR]]."
