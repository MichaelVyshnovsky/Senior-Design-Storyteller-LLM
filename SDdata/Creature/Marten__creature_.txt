'''Martens''' were a species of mustelid or "weasel", a family of small mammals that included [[ferret]]s and [[weasel]]s.<ref>{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|13}}{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|17}}

==Description==
These animals were similar in appearance to other mustelids, They measured around {{SIrange|2|4|ft|long=yes}} in length and weighed around {{SIrange|2|16|lb|k}}. Much like other mustelids, martens were skilled swimmers.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
These creatures were a carnivorous species.

===Habitats===
Like other mustelids, martens could be found in a wide variety of climates, though they more commonly inhabited cooler ones. They generally preferred to avoid dense settlements.{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|14}}

In [[north Faerûn]], they could be found in parts of the [[Dalelands]],{{Cite web/Realmslore/Storm Silverhand's Quieter Days IV: On the Boil, Part 2}} particularly [[Daggerdale]]

Beyond [[Faerûn]], martens could be found across much of the continent of [[Kara-Tur]], living in temperate forests and plains as well as tropical and sub-tropical forests.

===Relationships===
Some [[wizard]]s were known to have martens as [[familiar]]s.

===Usage===
The hides of these creatures were quite valued,<ref><ref> ranking among the most prized pelts of the Silver Marches. They were valued more than the hides of ferrets, [[stoat]]s, and weasels, while they were typically valued less than those of [[ermine]]s, [[mink]]s, and [[sable]]s, though they could fetch comparable prices.

The marten pelts of the Silver Marches were carried and traded all across the [[Sword Coast]],

==Trivia==
In the [[church of Baervan Wildwanderer|church]] of [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], "Marten" was one of the titles for confirmed [[priest]]s, ranking directly above "[[Hedgehog]]" and below "Red Fox".
