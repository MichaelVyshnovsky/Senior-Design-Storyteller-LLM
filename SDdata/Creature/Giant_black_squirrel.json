        "mainbody": "'''Giant black squirrels''' were a large and predatory [[squirrel]] that lived in the dark parts of [[Cormanthor]] called the [[Starwood]].",
        "Description": "These giant black squirrels were about the size of a small [[dog]], far larger than the ordinary squirrels that were so common in many forests.",
        "Behavior": "They were malicious little critters that would attack helpless or very weak creatures, and were opportunistic thieves, stealing small shiny objects, like coins or jewelry, from those unaware creatures too strong to attack directly.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Giant black squirrels were typically known to eat fruits, nuts, and grains, but would happily feast on the flesh of those weak enough to succumb to a scurry of these beasts."
        },
        "Habitats": "In [[North Faerûn|northern Faerûn]], they could be found in the deeper and darker parts of Cormanthor, always lairing 20 or more feet above the ground in the hollows of trees."
