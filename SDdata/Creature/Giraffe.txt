Giraffes were a species of exceptionally tall mammals.
Like many herd animals, giraffes were a peaceful species and would flee in a stampede from whatever they perceived to be the greatest threat to their safety.
Giraffes were capable of delivering strong kicks with their hefty hooves.
Large herds of giraffes were known to roam the Chultan savannah.
Certain wands of wonder could summon giraffes.
