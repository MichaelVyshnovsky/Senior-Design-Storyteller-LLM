        "mainbody": "Sapphire dragons were the most territorial and antisocial of gem dragons. Militaristic and warlike, they loved to discuss military matters and strategy. They preferred to lair in deep, rocky caves and often kept large spiders in their home as a food source.\nSapphire dragons were covered in scales of various shades of blue, which sparkled with starburst patterns under sunlight. Some of their extremities, such as their tail barbs and the tips of their horns were physically disconnected from their bodies, held aloft by the dragons psionic force. These appendages moved or shifted in response to the dragons mood. An amused sapphire dragon might have its horns oscillate up and down, while an angry dragon would have its appendages flare and widen threateningly.\nSapphire dragons breathed a cone of extremely high-pitched sonic energy, which harmed opponents and caused them to panic and to become incapacitated for a few seconds.\nThey were also known to employ their considerable psionic abilities in combat, flinging enemies away, teleporting over short distances, and charming their opponents.\nthumb|350px||Adventurers walking into a sapphire dragons lair.\nThe favorite food of sapphire dragons consisted of giant spiders, which they greatly enjoyed hunting within their lairs. Older and more powerful sapphire dragons had the power to attract giant spiders to their lairs from within a  range.\nIt was common for sapphire dragons to establish large, labyrinthine lairs as vast cave systems within mountains, filled with secret passages and chambers. A powerful dragons lair was warped by the creatures magic, often turning the substance of the stone into crystalline formations, with numerous underground sapphire veins. Sometimes, there was no way into or out of a sapphire dragons lair without the need to dig or to use magic.\nWithin its lair, the dragon used its natural ability to psionically manipulate rock, as well as its burrowing capabilities, to create a vast network of tunnels and chambers separated by thin walls. This complex structure allowed the dragon to move around its entire lair virtually undetected by intruders.\nTypical sapphire dragon hoards were well catalogued and organized. In addition to the typical gold and gems, they included large quantities of magic weapons and armor, as well as treatises on military history and strategy, which usually occupied a central and prominent location within the hoard. It was not rare for a sapphire dragons treasure to include ancient and powerful relics.\nThe strong psionic powers of sapphire dragons often put them at odds with aberrations such as aboleths and mind flayers. They were particularly adept at finding areas that had been strongly influenced by the Far Realm and combating the creatures that spawned in those areas.\nAs a result of their territorial behavior, sapphire dragons often antagonized drow and dwarves. On the other hand, they often befriended rock gnome and svirfneblin communities, using their psionic influence to turn their settlements into military communities dedicated to protecting the dragons lairs.\nSapphire dragons were a favored monster of a variety of deities, including Gorm Gulthyn, Moradin, Gaerdal Ironhand, and Urogalan. Among the members of the Faer√ªnian pantheon, they were a favored monster of Amaunator.\nthumb|280px|A sapphire dragon using its psionic breath.\n* Malaeragoth\n* Bleucorundum\n* Tazaeraglaund, who lived beneath the Gryphon Mountains in Durpar.\n* Moroardryn, who laired in caverns in the Uthangol Mountains of the Shaar.\n* Vharharaunt \"Oldclaw\", who laired in a ruined giant keep in the high Thesk Mountains."
