        "Subspecies": "[[Frost giant]]s of the Sea of Moving Ice sometimes carved runes into the shells of nautili, creating what were known as runechanged nautiloids, which produced magically conductive [[ink]].\n\nGiant nautili appeared in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], as well as [[upper planes|upper planar]] oceans such as [[Lunia]], [[Thalasia]], and [[Ossa]]. Some giant nautili even swam in the depths of a few oceans of the [[Prime Material plane]].{{Cite dragon/193/The Dragon's Bestiary: They came from the Outer Planes!|96}}",

        "Trivia": "Some [[sea elves]] were known to craft and wear jewelry that was shaped like nautili."
