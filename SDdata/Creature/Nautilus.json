        "mainbody": "Nautili were squid-like creatures with large shells. They were thought to typically believed to be deep sea dwellers, though they foraged for food in the shallower waters of the Sea of Moving Ice.\nFrost giants of the Sea of Moving Ice sometimes carved runes into the shells of nautili, creating what were known as runechanged nautiloids, which produced magically conductive ink.\nGiant nautili appeared in the Elemental Plane of Water, as well as upper planar oceans such as Lunia, Thalasia, and Ossa. Some giant nautili even swam in the depths of a few oceans of the Prime Material plane.\nNautilus shells were valued by collectors, with prime specimens netting 5 gp. Tritons sometimes used nautilus shells to channel arcane magic, in lieu of i.e. wands. The Temple of Ten Thousand Gods used a nautilus shell as its symbol.\nSome sea elves were known to craft and wear jewelry that was shaped like nautili."
