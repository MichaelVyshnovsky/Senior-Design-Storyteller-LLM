        "mainbody": "Chaos rocs were gargantuan predatory birds found in the Tching Mountains on the Chultan Peninsula.\nThese creatures resembled gigantic eagles. Their plumage was brightly decorated and feathers could be any color of the rainbow. A fully grown chaos roc measured  from head to tail and had a  wingspan.\nChaos rocs built nests high up in the mountains. They used entire trees for the construction of their nests in the same manner than smaller birds used twigs. They nested far from other large creatures, including others of their kind, to ensure a steady supply of food. A typical hunting ground spread for  around their nest.\nChaos rocs preferred to attack on the wing. They could emit a prismatic spray from their eyes at will to an effective range of . This attack functioned just like the wizard spell but the chaos rocs spray only contained the colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo.\nGiven their immense size, these creatures could easily swallow creatures the size of giants or smaller. They could also toss such creatures about and dash them against the ground.\nChaos rocs hunted practically any living creature that could be found within their territory. It was not uncommon to see them flying off with livestock gripped in their mighty talons."
