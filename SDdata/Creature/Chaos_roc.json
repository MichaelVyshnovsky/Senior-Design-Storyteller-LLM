        "Description": "These creatures resembled gigantic [[eagle]]s. Their plumage was brightly decorated and feathers could be any color of the rainbow. A fully grown chaos roc measured {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} from head to tail and had a {{SI|240|ft|long=yes}} wingspan.",
        "Behavior": "Chaos rocs built nests high up in the mountains. They used entire trees for the construction of their nests in the same manner than smaller birds used twigs. They nested far from other large creatures, including others of their kind, to ensure a steady supply of food. A typical hunting ground spread for {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} around their nest.",
        "Combat": "Chaos rocs preferred to attack on the wing. They could emit a ''[[prismatic spray]]'' from their eyes at will to an effective range of {{SI|105|ft|long=yes}}. This attack functioned just like the [[wizard]] [[spell]] but the chaos roc's spray only contained the colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo.\n\nGiven their immense size, these creatures could easily swallow creatures the size of [[giant]]s or smaller. They could also toss such creatures about and dash them against the ground.",
        "Ecology": "Chaos rocs hunted practically any living creature that could be found within their territory. It was not uncommon to see them flying off with livestock gripped in their mighty talons."
