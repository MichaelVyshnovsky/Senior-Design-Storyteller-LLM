'''Drakkoths''', also called '''dracotaurs''' because of their passing similarity to centaurs, were a predatory, nomadic species related to [[dragon]]s.

==Description==
A dracotaur had a similar body structure to a [[centaur]], with the upper body of a [[humanoid]] and the lower body of a wingless [[dragon]]. They had a {{SIAdj|4|feet|long=yes|adj=long}} tail ending in large spikes, which was mainly used for balance, but could also be used as a weapon. Male dracotaurs possessed crests on their heads, throats, and chests, which ranged in color from bright red to dark purple.

==Personality==
Dracotaurs were sly and aggressive predators. They were typically merciless in battle. They had an affinity for the study of [[Sorcerer|sorcery]].

==Abilities==
Dracotaurs were able to produce small gouts of flame by spitting a globule of sticky saliva that burst into flames upon contact with air, similar to [[alchemist's fire]]. Once they do so, they cannot spit flames again for one minute.

In addition, dracotaurs produced a bodily oil that softened their scales, along with any [[leather armor]], keeping them supple.

==Combat==
In combat, dracotaurs typically employed ambush tactics before releasing a gout of flames and rushing into combat with [[spear]]s.

==Society==
Dracotaur societies took the form of small nomadic tribes. While different tribes had a habit of fighting among themselves, they were quick to form alliances to defend against outside threats. In addition, alliances with other reptilian species such as [[lizardfolk]] and [[naga]]s were not uncommon.

Dracotaurs saw [[true dragon]]s as the embodiments of their ancient [[Deity|gods]] and were willing to serve such dragons.

Due to their nomadic culture, dracotaurs rarely constructed permanent buildings, preferring to utilize ruins.

They had a deep hatred of [[centaur]]s, whom they would attack on sight and whenever the two races existed in the same region a brutal war of extermination would erupt. Upon killing a centaur, dracotaurs would feast on their flesh.
