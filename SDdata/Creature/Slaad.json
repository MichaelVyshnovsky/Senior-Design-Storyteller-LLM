Slaadi almost certainly existed around the time when the Abyss first formed, some having been bathed in its corruptive energy and transformed into twisted tadpole monsters, and intelligent slaads weren't always opposed to infusing their kind with its unholy power. There were theories that the two races were once one, with demons either being a corrupted race of slaadi or slaads having been demons that broke free of the Abyss's truly evil influence, although if such ideas were true, neither showed any affinity for each other any more.": "==The Stones===",
        "mainbody": "atever the origin of the slaadi, it seemed inextricably linked to the Spawning Stone, which itself had more than one creation myth. Some accounts stated that the overlord of the modrons, [[Primus]], was responsible for the Spawning Stone, having created it and casted it into Limbo eons before the arrival of the githzerai. According to such tales, Primus's intention had been to use the law-infused Stone to generate stability in Limbo, in order to prevent its chaos from spreading. While it did make it possible for ordered minds to exist in Limbo, the chaotic energy it absorbed accidentally spawned the slaadi, which immediately set about exterminating every modron colony on the plane. If the story was true then Primus seemed unfazed by his failure, either dismissing the slaadi as threats or choosing to willfully ignore their existence.\n\nAnother theory posited that the reason why the slaads were limited was another result of Ygorl's tampering, possibly with the help of Ssendam. When the two first became slaad lords, they considered the possibility that through random mutation, a slaad could appear that was stronger than them and that could supplant them. Possibly taking a lesson from the [[githyanki]] queen, they decided to handicap their competition by ensuring that no slaad could arise that would naturally be stronger than them, while allowing them to retain their chaotic natures. Thus, Ygorl created the Spawning Stone from the purest essence of Limbo and used the blazing white, arcane runes that covered its structure to bind the essence of the entire race to it, although it was possible that the two simply altered it rather than having made it. Only a few of the slaad lords, possibly including [[Bazim-Gorag]], knew for certain about the nature of the Spawning Stone, and true to the secretive ways of the slaad lords, they refused to reveal such knowledge.\n\nThere also, at times, existed a seemingly connected structure known as the [[Pandemonium Stone]], a great spire covered in similar runes to the Spawning Stone that randomly materialized in an elemental maelstrom within the Elemental Chaos. No god or primordial claimed to have made it, all having known of its existence before the [[Dawn War]], and some entity of god-like power seemed to be gestating inside of it. The enigmatic pillar possibly anchored the minds of the slaadi to reality similarly to how the Spawning Stone restrained their forms, potentially signifying that whoever or whatever trapped them might also have been responsible for their crazier behaviors. \n\n===Multiverse===\nOne of the most controversial theories about the slaadi postulated that all of their contradictory origin stories were correct because multiple alternate realities simultaneously existed, possibly even an infinite amount. Perhaps the slaadi all descended from different universes and could still faintly see the other realities or all realities collapsed into a single timeline at some point leaving the slaadi the only ones capable of seeing and remembering the possible multiverses. The theory was thought by most scholars to be absurd, but it was hard to say what was truly impossible for the avatars of chaos.",
        "Description": "[[File:Redslaadgem.png|left|thumb|125px|''A [[red slaad]]i gem'']]\n\nSlaadi, in their base form, resembled large, bipedal frogs with long, sharp claws, and huge heads.\n\nDespite generally sharing the same basic, if baffling, appearance, slaadi were nonetheless creatures of [[chaos]] and so no two were exactly identical. They always had at least mild differences in height, build and eye position even within their own subtype, some breeds being [[human]]-sized and gangly while others were huge and muscular, and many possessed even more distinguishing traits. While some classified slaads by color, slaads of the same breed could vary not only in their exact shade and pattern but also be of the opposite color entirely.\n\nOther potential differences included additional body parts and organs, features of greater or lesser size, various body types, and wholly unique features like horns, scales, tails and hair. More outlandish traits, such as blade-like claws, wings whether functional or not, and even a medusa's snake-like hair, were also fully possible. It was also possible that, given that some of the more powerful slaadi had [[polymorph]]ing abilities which allowed them to transform into [[humanoid]]s, often those of their original hosts, that one might not even recognize a slaad upon meeting them.",
        "Behavior": {
            "Beliefs": "Although slaad behavior could be written off as utterly mad and nonsensical, much of it was a result of their own alien cultural ideas for acceptable forms of interaction, a result of their chaotic environment.While in Limbo, slaads were effectively needless, able to exist within it unharmed and requiring only food in order to live. As a result, slaadi lacked common concepts of possession, having no personal items and instead simply taking what they needed when it was required. Because slaads believed that they owned anything they could take, they revered those able to take the most and thus held individual strength as one of, if not the, greatest virtue. Many slaads were obsessed with proving and improving their personal power and loved conflict, seeing it both as an exciting, chaotic clash of forces and a chance to show off their strength.\n\nWhen stronger slaads oppressed and domineered their weaker brethren it was seen not as an objectional affront to be opposed as a group, but an acceptable activity and in fact the stronger slaad exercising his due right, a cruelty so normalized that it was performed without passion or ceremony. This bizarre, unspoken social contract that led to acts of such casual cruelty was something that slaads placed on all other beings they interacted with, treating others as tools to be used at their leisure and reacting strangely well at attempts to bully them since they viewed it as the only acceptable form of interaction. Some slaads were said to believe that they were the only truly sentient beings in the universe, all others being imaginings of slaad minds, another possible explanation for their brutality.",
            "Alignment": "There were conflicting reports about the response of the [[neutral]] slaadi to the moral extremes of [[good]] and [[evil]]; even the greatest of their kind could be hard to call evil, just unapologetically flippant and self-centered.{{Cite dragon/221/The Dragon's Bestiary: Lords of Chaos|72-78}} Those that dwelt in the [[lower planes]] were said to become crueler and harsher in order to survive in its infinite horrors, although whether or not they would turn back was unknown. Other reports claimed that, in a natural need for balance, slaads exposed to sadism and hate would lean towards charitable and benevolent behavior, a theory supported by certain slaads themselves.\n\nRegardless, slaads were beings interested in the spread and triumph of chaos, seeing reality as too restrained by logic and sense and quickly growing bored by torturous inactivity and uninteresting stability. While the more primitive slaad did so as a result of following their instincts, always striving after their own goals, those with greater intelligence, whether it be from mutation or caste, did so deliberately. Despite the common slaads generally being lacking in intelligence and prone to barbarism, assuming that the random and unpredictable spawn of Limbo were necessarily moronic was, at the very least, dangerously unwise.\n\n{{quote\n|Slaadi... prove that chaotic beings do not have to be ''stupid'' beings.\n|Xanxost\n}}"

        "Abilities": {
            "Control over chaos": "Granting the slaadi a special advantage on their home [[plane]] was their control over a substance called [[chaos matter]], a strange primal soup unique to Limbo composed of the basal elements of [[water]], [[Earth (element)|earth]], fire and [[air]] but resembled none of its components. It was dry and hazy yet fluid and opaque, a highly destructive stew that couldn't be breathed and dissolved anything it touched. The strange substance floated throughout Limbo but even the raw chaos it was unstable in its instability, constantly forming into mountains, meadows, water and woods and changing back at random. However, chaos matter could be stabilized when introduced to sentient thought, allowing it to be reshaped into solid ground, breathable air, plants, and even used to regulate gravity.\n\nBeings known as [[anarch]]s, found more frequently among denizens of Limbo but occasionally in visitors, had even greater control over it, with true and rare geniuses being able to conjure buildings, animals and possibly even ecosystems. All slaads were innate anarchs, able to breathe and swim inside chaos matter without being eroded and shape it to their whims. Even when unconscious, slaadi tightly controlled the area of chaos matter around them, allowing them to pass through it unharmed whether it was a ball of fire or mass of magma."

        "Combat": {
            "Blood War": "Despite their love of violence, slaadi were offended by the concept of war, seeing it as the antithesis of their ideals. Their [[law]]ful counterparts, the [[modron]]s, opposed war because it was an emergence of chaos, but slaadi despised it because it was the ultimate destruction of individuality, a giant swarm where no single entity had a chance to prove itself. In regards to the [[Blood War]], a neverending battle between [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s, slaads were relatively insignificant, their desire to cause disorder hampered by their disorderly nature. Their chaotic ways meant that they couldn't seriously devote real armies and even when they gathered on a large scale they were somewhat ineffective.\n\nThough they praised the virtues of chaos, slaads on the whole fought for personal glory rather than to uphold their philosophy. The slaad urge for bloodshed and need to test themselves led them to search out conflict, drives powerful and frequent enough to ensure that slaad warbands were fighting in the Blood War somewhere at any given time.\n\n{{quote\n|...the [[baatezu]].

Their chain of command was undisciplined and informal, based not in any respect for abstract authority but the pragmatic deference to beings of greater power; in other words, stronger slaads ruled over weaker ones using brute force, threatening the disobedient with destruction. The hierarchy ascended from the common but weak [[red slaad|red]] and [[blue slaad]]i, the slightly less common [[green slaad]]i, the rarer [[gray slaad]]i, and, at least in the minds of most, ended with the dreaded [[death slaad]]i, although more powerful breeds such as [[white slaad|white]] and [[black slaad|black]] had been reported.\n\nThe death slaadi were said to be the closest the race had to kings, thought of as the most perfect specimen of their kind by other slaadi and so dutifully obeyed. They were the creatures responsible for directing the efforts of the slaad race and inscribing the symbols of rank into the heads of other slaads. Because the closest that slaadi came to actual lawfulness was their willingness to acknowledge and serve more powerful beings, the authority of greater slaads typically only extended only as far as they could physically reach. Without the cohesion to form proper armies or the desire to enter intrigues like fiends, the slaad desire to bring themselves into power typically manifested as strong slaads sending their weaker brethren as thugs."

When within Limbo, they were similar in power to [[lesser deity|lesser deities]], maintaining domains stable even in their absence. While they were in a position to demand service from weaker slaadi, several slaad lords didn't care to do so, although less out of a respect for their free will and more out of a simple disinterest in having followers.

Ygorl had actual slaad worshipers and fanatics under his control, although almost all slaads followed his instructions regardless to avoid destruction. He made few demands of the slaads, but those he did had a drastic impact on their kind, such as him ordering the death slaadi to rally mobs of the red and blue to invade other planes in order to perpetuate both their race and chaos itself.\n\nThe abilities of the slaad lords were shrouded in mystery, another result of Ygorl's dictates. Ygorl believed, perhaps correctly, that if knowledge of the slaad lords became too widespread that they would be treated with the banality that accompanied familiarity, treated as another caste of slaad and forced to fend off beings from across the planes wishing to prove their strength. Anyone asking about slaadi deities was to be devoured and Ygorl himself consumed any slaad close to becoming a slaad lord themselves in order to keep their numbers low and perpetuate their rarity. Thus, outside of an overarching idea, the process of becoming a slaad lord was barely understood."

        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Slaadi were an entirely carnivorous race although they weren't strictly predators, willing to scavenge corpses and devour 'exotic' foods such as certain [[mephit]]s and fiends. It was said that chaos was as vital to them as food and that without pandemonium they felt pangs of discontent",
            "Uses": "Slaads could be skinned to produce a poison that could be smeared on weapons, something only a few githzerai were willing to hunt them for but a divide between the races. It was also possible to coat the slaads in a fatty substance and then distill the poison from the mixture without killing them.\n\nThe arcane ''[[Tome of the Amulet]]'' of [[Imaskar]]an scribing held the secrets of creating ''[[amulet of natural armor|amulets of natural armor]]''. Ingredients needed were: tongue of a slaad, [[fenberry|fenberries]], and the spell of ''[[mage armor]]''.",
            "Locations": "Slaadi were native to Limbo,\n\n[[File:Limbo-3e.png|thumb|right|250px|A map of Limbo]]\n\nKnown by the githzerai as Urkocl and by the [[Ysgard]]ians as Slaadheim was the slaadi's primordial home and center of dominion, referred to by them as the Spawning Stone. It was a place of untamed, bestial savagery and lust covered gore and worse and inscribed with a mysterious script meaningful only to some slaadi that seemed to wriggle and change, although whether or not they actually moved was unclear. It served several purposes, primarily as a rallying point for the slaad to meet and mate as well as a storage location for food, weapons and anything else the slaadi found worth keeping. The stone drifted throughout Limbo although there were varying reports about its exact size and shape. In some descriptions it was geometrically complex while others described it as a mile long, three-quarter mile wide slab. At times, it was said to be a whorled, multicolored sphere and at others a bent, blue-gray horseshoe that flared out at the ends.\n\nIt was reported that the inside was honeycombed with circular rooms where the death slaadi inscribed the symbols of rank on the lower slaads, but it was difficult to even try to see the Spawning Stone. Aside from the fact that it was surrounded by churning, [[elemental vortex|elemental vortices]], and that the powers of normal anarchs were weakened when they entered a hundred miles of it, non-slaadi weren't allowed within miles of the Spawning Stone and the slaadi threatened anyone who tried with immediate death. Atop a large iron throne perched on the Spawning Stone normally sat an ancient death slaad known as the Guardian of the Stone, who combined martial skill, sorcerous power and anarch mastery to prevent any other creatures from drawing close. Rumors had it that if the stone was ever wrested away from the slaadi then the new owner would be reborn as a death slaad with anarchic power, but at the same time it could just melt away into the chaos and force the slaadi to create a new one."

            "Life Cycle": "[[File:Slaadburster.png|left|thumb|200px|''A tadpole bursts from the ambitious actor that summoned its parent.'']]\nSlaad tadpoles, born in a bath of blood, were voracious and immature, devouring vermin, corpses and anything else they could find. Unable to properly fight and concerned only with cramming food into their wide mouths, the deformed slaad juveniles had to compensate with an extremely fast metabolism and developmental phase. It wouldn't take more than a few hours for their undeveloped hind legs to grow, their translucent tails to shrink and their flesh to darken in a revolting, molting process, and in just a few more days they would fully transform into mature members of their species. It would take several years for a fully-grown slaad to be completely self-sufficient despite being fully grown.\n\nThe exact lifespan of slaads seemed to vary. Slaads slain in battle permanently died, although it was said that the green slaads possibly had some system of reincarnation similar to that of a [[lich]]. Upon reaching a certain age, slaads traveled deep into Limbo, having come to some instinctive realization that allowed them to undergo a special transformation. Most, presumably, broke down into their basal essences and dissolved into the primal chaos of Limbo, but some returned as higher forms of slaad. This metamorphosis seemed to exclude the red and blue slaads, but it was possible that they too could advance into a higher form.\n\n{{quote\n|Even slaadi die when they die.\n|Xanxost\n}}\n\n[[File:Putrid_slaad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''A putrid slaad'']]\n\nOccasionally, [[necromancer]]s and other malevolent mages transformed slaads into [[undead]] versions of themselves known as putrid slaads, almost uncontrollable monsters that shared their living selves desire to devour and devastate.

            "Spawning Stone": "Some mysterious quality of the Spawning Stone gave slaadi eggs their fertility and without it all slaadi would be infertile. Every few years, seemingly at random, each breed of slaad would feel an undeniable urge to reproduce and be led back to the Spawning Stone from wherever they were. Each breed had their own season, although only slaads were able to tell them apart, involving their own invocations, rituals, and preferences creating different temperatures, environments and blends of chaos matter, effectively resulting in different \"flavors\" of chaos for each kind. The cycle was thought to involve the core breeds, in order the red, blue, green, gray and death slaads, holding the area around the stone, which could range from a few miles to a hundred yards based on numbers, until forcefully ejected by the next type, the hordes of red slaadi having the numbers to remove the death slaadi.\n\nEach group was supposed to have their eggs fertilized by their own type by the end of the process, although slaads so routinely got caught up in the mating frenzy that it was normal to find a few dead slaadi floating through the air, having instinctually implanted their kin. The mating process caused currents of chaos-stuff to manifest around the Stone and flow outwards throughout Limbo which other slaads could recognize and follow \"upstream\" to reach the stone. Eventually the currents would twist into tidal waves and tsunamis until the stone fell into the grasp of a different slaad breed and the whirlpools became chaos storms, destructive maelstroms that slaads loved to follow."
        },
        "History": "Contrary to popular belief, slaads were not naturally limited to the handful of commonly seen, toad-like forms. In truth, the slaadi were beings of ultimate chaos that naturally followed no set pattern of shapes or sizes. Some true slaadi looked like ordinary slaads but had four arms or a single arm sprouting from their chest. There were gigantic breeds, that reached {{SI|20|ft}} and sometimes {{SI|60|ft}} tall, while others were squat, short and barrel chested with flat heads and wide-slitted eyes. The truly alien true slaadi could look entirely different from their common kin, having orange skin and tendrils for arms with eyes covering the boils on their back rather than being placed on their heads. Stranger still in appearance were true slaadi that had almost no resemblance to their kin at all, Ygorl and Ssendam being excellent representatives of how variable they could appear.\n\nFor some odd reason, modern slaadi had been restricted in form, although fortunately for them, trying to apply order to the inherently chaotic was practically impossible.{{Cite dragon/306/Killing Cousins: Githzerai Hit Squads|57-58}} Slaad mutants different enough to be classified as true slaadi were still born and often moved to secret nurseries where they were fed raw chaos and that could house over a hundred of the creatures at a time. Whether or not the mutants were hidden by or from Ssendam and Ygorl was unclear, but the two apparently had the power to allow slaads of their choice to regain their true forms.",

Thus, Ygorl created the Spawning Stone from the purest essence of Limbo and used the blazing white, arcane runes that covered its structure to bind the essence of the entire race to it, although it was possible that the two simply altered it rather than having made it. Only a few of the slaad lords, possibly including [[Bazim-Gorag]], knew for certain about the nature of the Spawning Stone, and true to the secretive ways of the slaad lords, they refused to reveal such knowledge.\n\nThere also, at times, existed a seemingly connected structure known as the [[Pandemonium Stone]], a great spire covered in similar runes to the Spawning Stone that randomly materialized in an elemental maelstrom within the Elemental Chaos. No god or primordial claimed to have made it, all having known of its existence before the [[Dawn War]], and some entity of god-like power seemed to be gestating inside of it. The enigmatic pillar possibly anchored the minds of the slaadi to reality similarly to how the Spawning Stone restrained their forms, potentially signifying that whoever or whatever trapped them might also have been responsible for their crazier behaviors.",
            "Multiverse": "One of the most controversial theories about the slaadi postulated that all of their contradictory origin stories were correct because multiple alternate realities simultaneously existed, possibly even an infinite amount. Perhaps the slaadi all descended from different universes and could still faintly see the other realities or all realities collapsed into a single timeline at some point leaving the slaadi the only ones capable of seeing and remembering the possible multiverses. The theory was thought by most scholars to be absurd, but it was hard to say what was truly impossible for the avatars of chaos."
