        "Abilities": "Ghouls could paralyze their victims with a claw or bite wound, though [[elves]] were immune. Paralysis lasted at least a dozen seconds and up to half a minute. Like most types of undead, ghouls were immune to mind affecting [[spell]]s, such as ''[[sleep]]''.\n\nThe bite of a ghoul also inflicted a terrible disease, [[ghoul fever]], deteriorating health and agility within a day. Any who died from the illness rose as a ghoul at midnight.",

            "Creation": "It was believed that a living man or woman of any species who'd tasted the flesh of people would rise again as ghouls after they died. This was  proven wrong however, but it fitted their cannibalistic behavior. However, others believed that anyone who indulged in extreme debauchery and evil could become a ghoul after death. depending on the species the ghoul was in life they can gain simalr abilities just warped slightlyThis account probably derives from the popular connection of the word \"ghoul\" with graverobbers and persons who delighted in the macabre, rather than the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoul demon of Arabic mythology] with the same name.\n\nWhatever the truth, it was clear that any humanoid who was bitten by a ghoul, contracted ghoul fever, and died of it would inevitably rise as a ghoul themselves the following night, at midnight. Unless they were blessed or blessed and ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' by a [[cleric]] before they could turn.\n\nThe new-risen ghoul lost all the skills and powers it had in life. Their minds became warped, turning them feral yet cunning and hungry for living flesh, becoming in all ways like another ghoul. They were not bound to serve other ghouls, however.\n\nA more experienced or powerful victim would instead became a [[ghast]].",
            "Diet": "Ghouls had a terrible hunger for carrion. They not only ate the dead, but also preyed on the living. They lurked in graveyards and on battlefields, wherever their foul food was plentiful and the air was thick with the smell of death.",
            "Homelands": "Along with many other kinds of undead, ghouls were known to hunt within the [[Battle of Bones]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Ghouls also dwelled inside the [[House of Stone]] on the edge of the [[Ardeep Forest]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], ghouls could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]. Intelligent ghouls made up the ruling class in the undead city of [[Evernight]] in the [[Shadowfell]].",
