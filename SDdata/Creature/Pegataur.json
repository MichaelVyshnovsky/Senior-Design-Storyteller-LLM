        "mainbody": "'''Pegataurs''' were a species of [[centaur]] that sported wings, much like a [[pegasus]].There were no known instances of a pegataur in a Realms sourcebook. However, they are listed in ''[[Demihuman Deities]]'' as one of many creatures that could appear in the Realms to act on behalf of [[Aerdrie Faenya]]. For this reason, pegataurs are documented in this article.\n\n{{Quote|I'm half elf, half mighty stallion, half noble [[eagle]] and more'n the sum of me parts.|''The overheard boast of a pegataur in Serraine''}}",
        "Description": "The [[humanoid]] upper-half of a pegataur resembled an [[elf]], with long blond or silver hair. Their equine lower bodies were typically strong and healthy, sporting coats of either black, brown, gray, or white. The plumage of their wings was downy and typically white. On average they grew to stand around {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} tall.\n\nThey usually didn't wear any armor, in order to provide themselves better mobility. The most common forms of armor worn by them were [[chainmail]], followed by [[leather armor]] and [[elven chainmail]].",
        "Personality": "Pegataurs generally had a rather aloof personality, especially towards creatures that couldn't fly. They prided themselves on their fitness, stamina, and strength.",
        "Abilities": "Much like a [[half-elf]], they were partially resistant ''[[charm]]'' and ''[[sleep]]'' [[spell]]s. Their bodies were also quite resistant to high and low temperatures.",
        "Combat": "In addition to their hooves, pegataurs were known to fight with [[longbow]]s, light [[lance]]s, [[two-handed sword]]s, and [[horseman's mace]]s. They also had no qualms against allies [[mount]]ing them for the purposes of combat.\n\nPegataurs were known to dive down at their opponents with lances, but only when they managed to surprise them.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Pegataurs were only known to be found on the planet [[Mystara]]. There they lived in all sorts of climates, but preferred lightly wooded hills. They lived in abodes carved into the sides of high mountains in regions with temperate climates. These caves, called tehir, had vaulted ceilings and intricately carved walls. They were also adorned with crystals that provided illumination at night.\n\nSome pegataurs on that world lived in a flying city known as Serraine.",
            "Languages": "Pegataurs typically spoke [[Common]] and [[Elvish]], as well as their own language that was related to Elvish.",
            "Relationships": "So long as they were paid well and treated with respect pegataurs were willing to work for most creatures as bodyguards, troops, or for special tasks. Though they never worked for [[evil]] individuals. They also sometimes worked with [[druid]]s to maintain the balance of nature in an area and would train pegasi to be mounts for ground dwellers. Another major source of interaction between pegataurs and other races was their desire to commission the manufacture of fine barding.\n\nPegataurs were known to sometimes act as [[favored monster|servants]] of the goddess [[Aerdrie Faenya]], a member of [[Toril]]'s [[Elven pantheon]]."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "One legend on Mystara claimed that the first pegataurs resulted from a mad [[wizard]] fusing an elf and a pegasus together."
