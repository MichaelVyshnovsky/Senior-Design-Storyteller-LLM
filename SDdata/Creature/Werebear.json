        "mainbody": "'''Werebears''' were [[lycanthrope|lycanthropic]] [[Shapechanger|shapeshifters]] able to transform into a bipedal [[bear]] form. Their animal instincts guided them to protect the splendors of nature, while their humanoid minds told them to help travelers and provide aid to the weak.\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Werebear humanoid forms were often large, heavily muscled, and covered in hair. Their hair was thick and shaggy with males typically having beards, and hair color ranged from brown, black, and blonde to even red or ivory. Werebears dressed in simple garments that could be easily removed or repaired. Their ursine forms most often resembled a [[brown bear]], although their human form's hair always matched their bear form's fur color,  with brown being common in forest regions and ivory being common in frozen regions. They also possessed a hybrid form that resembled a bipedal bear with paws and long claws.",
        "Behavior": "They saw themselves as the guardians standing between the natural world and civilization. In order to prevent themselves from harming others they controlled their savagery and isolated themselves. When in bear form they were irritable and moody, actively seeking out evil entities to slay. They were particularly hateful of evil lycanthropes, although a small few were just as evil as them.",
        "Combat": "No matter the form, werebears had an especially keen sense of smell. Werebears typically armed themselves with weapons like [[greataxe]]s and [[throwing axe]]s and knives along with other weapons that had practical utility, although had a preference for those that allowed them to use their strength. They would only use their bear or hybrid forms if they were at risk of death. When in their bear forms, werebears grew much larger, and showed an increase in their ability to climb and swim. It also granted them a strong hold, grasping enemies between their paws with incredible ease.\n\nWerebears in hybrid form could choose between wielding an axe, or slashing at their enemies with their claws. Despite their strong teeth, they refused to bite into their opponents to avoid the chance of transforming them. Like all lycanthropes they could not be harmed by normal weaponry in their transformed states, requiring [[silver]] or magical weapons to permanently harm them. They could also call any bear within a mile radius to their location. Werebears were mostly likely to become [[ranger]]s, [[druid]]s or wildlife [[priest]]s.",
        "Ecology": "Werebears were mostly solitary, living in forest near waterways on the outskirts of civilization. Like most lycanthropes there were true and infected members of the species, with the former being born and their status irreversible, and the latter being turned by another member of the species through bite. Females would bear 1 or 2 children in human form with the children being born appearing humanoid until they turned eight. After this point they would gain the ability to transform into large shaggy bears, and the mother would chase the adolescents away to continue the cycle. Normal werebears claimed territories between 1-4 miles in size, and felt a close bond to their homes. They possessed a natural empathy with other ursines and could bond with them more easily. Transformed individuals gained an incredible boost in physical power even in their human forms.\n\nLike normal bears, werebears were omnivores, preferring to eat small mammals and fish. They also enjoyed a type of honey rich mead, although it was highly intoxicating to normal humanoids. They had few natural predators but were the enemies of evil lycanthropes, primarily the werewolves of which they commonly shared territory with, but also wererats.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "In [[north Faer√ªn]], werebears could be found in the forests of [[Mistledale]], [[Shadowdale]], and around the [[Pool of Yeven]].\n\nIn the [[Unapproachable East]], werebears could be found in the interior uplands and [[Yuirwood]] of [[Aglarond]],<ref> as well as within the forests of [[Rashemen]].<ref>"

        "Notable Werebears": "* [[Bakra Hispul]], an [[ogre]] [[Dire animal|dire]] werebear [[ranger]] of [[Tall Trees]].\n* [[Oyaminartok]], a goliath polar werebear in [[Icewind Dale]]."
