'''Horses''' on [[Toril]] came in a number of breeds, of varying size and demeanor. They were often used by [[humanoid]] races for riding, the pulling of carts and wagons or other forms of work.<ref><ref><ref>

==Description==
Horses were classified in a number of different manners. ''Chargers'', or more plainly ''warhorses'' were those horses bred to ride in battle. Light warhorses were referred to as ''coursers'' while heavy warhorses were known as ''destriers''.{{Cite dragon/74/Warhorses and Barding|4}}

==Behavior==
Some of the best-trained horses were trained by the [[elf|elven]] [[House Korianthil]].

==Reputation==
Horses were considered sacred to many faiths of [[Faerûn]]. Warhorses were important to followers of [[Anhur]], the [[Red Knight]], and [[Tempus]]. Pinto and piebald horses were particularly favored by [[Deneir]]; palomino horses to [[Waukeen]]. Gray-haired horses were sacred to [[Mask]], while white ones were sacred to [[Milil]], and chestnut-colored horses to [[Sune]]. [[Mystra]] favored [[donkey]]s, horses, and [[mule]]s with blue or mismatched eyes. Intelligent horses were also native to the celestial realms of [[Sehanine Moonbow]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

Horses were a kind of novelty for [[Thymari]] [[dragonborn]], as such beasts weren't common in [[Abeir]]. As such, horses, specially warhorses were highly valued by Thymari, who cared for them as precious friends.

==History==
A white horse was the symbol for the [[sun elf]] house of [[Evanara]].

Horses were unknown in [[Maztica]] prior to the arrival of the [[Golden Legion]] in [[1361 DR]]. The Golden Legion used them in battle against the Mazticans, who were shocked by them and had no experience in fighting cavalry before. <ref>
