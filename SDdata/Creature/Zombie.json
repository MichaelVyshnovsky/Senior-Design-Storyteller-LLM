        "mainbody": "A zombie was an undead creature usually created by the re-animation of a corpse. Unlike animated skeletons, zombies still retained some flesh on their bodies and gave off a horrid, rank smell. They were almost mindless, but could be given simple commands, such as \"kill anyone who opens the treasure chest.\" Virtually any solid creature could be turned into a zombie in addition to humanoids, troglodytes, minotaurs, ogres, and even beholders, among others, could be turned into zombies.\nBasically, a zombie was the corpse of a creature that had been animated by someone who could manipulate negative energy, such as a cleric. For example, a cleric would be able to use negative energy on a corpse and make it move its body, arms, legs, etc. On rare occasions, ordinary zombies retained some of their basic cognitive functions, able to speak simple words and phrases and some were capable of wielding weapons.\nZombies dragged their feet and so did not leave clear prints.\nThey were manifestations of the lowest tiers of necromantic magic and were naught but soulless shambling shells. When a zombie was raised, its soul was already long gone to the afterlife and was not forced into the decaying corpse.\nNecromancers used demons blood as a powerful magical adhesive liberally applied to zombies joints to stave the rotting and disintegration of tissues.\nThe monstrous hamlet of Wormbarrow was located deep within Undermountain, inhabited by Ghaunadaur-worshiping avolakias and numerous undead, including zombies.\nIn the 15 century DR, the Jungles of Chult became home to hordes of zombies created by Ras Nsi in an attempt to conquer the city of Mezro. With the city departing the Prime Material plane, Nsis zombies remained a plague.\n10,000 zombies inhabited the so-called City of Zombies in the 333 layer of the Abyss, ruled by the Zombie King. These rotting wrecks were victims of Orcus and sought to achieve true death that would end their torturous existence.\nZombies were common shock troops used by the drow of Menzoberranzan, including House DoUrden that used fellow drow as their undead servants.\nThey were also a profitable business. Shradins Excellent Zombies shop in Skullport offered zombies controllable via a dead hand scepter for purchase.\n Ankylosaurus zombie\n A zombie created from the corpse of an ankylosaurus, typical to the jungles of Chult.\n Ash zombie\n A zombie created from ash of the victims of the Mount Hotenow explosion. Usually Thayan magic in the creation.\n Beholder zombie\n Sometimes called Death tyrants zombified beholders which possessed some of their deadly abilities.\n Chillborn zombie\n Zombies infused with deathly cold, which were capable of sapping the life from their victims.\n Girallon zombie\n Crated from the corpse of a girallon, typical to some locations in Chult.\n Gravehound\n Undead hounds found in Shadowfell and sometimes used by Thayan necromancers.\n Greater zombie\n A stronger and more resilient version of an ordinary zombie.\n Juju zombie\n Free-willed, sentient zombies often created from powerful curses or other fell magics.\n Netherese zombie\n Intelligent and sentient walking dead servants of the Lichlord.\n Ogre zombie\n Powerful zombies created from dead ogres.\n Sea zombie\n Created from the corpses of humans who drowned at sea.\n Tyrannosaurus zombie\n Created from the corpse of a tyrannosaurus, typical to Chult. These fearsome creatures could regurgitate zombies from their gullets.\n Tyrantfog zombie\n Priests of evil deities killed by other evil deities.\n Zombie dragon\n Created from dragons and retained some of their deadly abilities. Not to be confused with dracoliches.\n* Connor Vinderblad, a victim of Auntie Ethels in the late 15 century DR.\n* Viledel, the Sea King, and his wife Liala, rose as well-reserved zombies when their tomb on the Island of Viledel was disturbed by a group of shipwreck survivors in the mid-14 century DR."
