A '''winter wolf''' was more akin to a [[worg]] than an actual wolf, being of wicked intelligence and cunning.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
It grew to about {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in length, {{SI|4'6"|ft-in}} at the shoulder, and weighed around {{SI|450|lbs.}}. They had glistening white or silvery coats of fur and eyes that were either silvery or a very pale blue, with the latter eye color being more predominant in their species.

==Personality==
These creatures were known to often have a foul disposition.

==Combat==
Using their fur as camouflage, winter wolves would lay in wait for prey. When an ambush was triggered, winter wolves would encircle their prey and take turns to attack, or attempt to pin it. They could breathe gusts of cold as well as bite their victims. They could also trip their enemies. They were immune to cold and cold magic, but were vulnerable to [[fire]].

==Society==
[[File:Northlanders_vs_winter_wolf-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|''A winter wolf attacking a group of [[Northlander]]s.'']]
Winter wolves typically lived in packs of around three to five. They were well organized and their leaders were both the strongest and smartest among them. When hunting they typically traveled against the wind in order to ensure that their prey couldn't smell them.
===Diet===
Like all wolves, these creatures were a carnivorous species.
===Homelands===
Winter wolves were only known to inhabit cold climates, particularly in forests and plains.

They inhabited the region of [[High Ice]], where they often hunted [[ice toad]]s. In the [[Unapproachable East]], winter wolves could be found in the the [[High Country (Rashemen)|High Country]] and coastal regions of [[Rashemen]],<ref> as well as [[Ashanath]] and [[Rawlinswood]].

Beyond [[Faer√ªn]], they could be found in nearly all arctic areas of [[Kara-Tur]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]] they could be found in the [[plane]] of [[Clangor]], where they were used as [[mount]]s by the plane's [[goblin]] inhabitants, and the plane of [[Jotunheim]] where they were as large as [[elephant]]s.

===Languages===
Winter Wolves were known to speak their own bestial language, as well as the language of worgs, [[Common]], and [[Giant (language)|Giant]].
===Relationships===
Winter wolves were  sometimes found as allies and guardians of [[frost giant]]s, [[white dragon]]s, and other evil arctic beings.

The pelts of these creatures could often sell for around 5,000 [[gp]].

==Notable Winter Wolves==
* [[Koran]] and [[Kanan]], the intelligent paired wolves of [[Icewind Dale]].
*[[Hurrahesh]], a winter wolf who roamed the [[High Country (Rashemen)|High Country]] of [[Rashemen]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
