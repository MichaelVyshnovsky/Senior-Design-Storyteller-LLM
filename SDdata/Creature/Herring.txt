===Habitats===
Schools of herring were found in abundance inhabiting waters of the [[Trackless Sea]].

===Usages===
*Dried herring was a common food going as far back as the ancient empire of [[Netheril]], where it was often seen as part of [[elf|elven]] rations.
*[[Salt]]ed herring was packed in barrels for preservation and transportation on the city of [[Phlan]] of the [[Moonsea]] region.
*In the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], herring was sometimes served on a platter with [[egg]]s. Simple pan-fried herring was served in Waterdeep's [[Inn of the Dripping Dagger]] for a humble price of four [[copper]] [[coin]]s.
*Barrel-fulls of picked herring were quite common as well and other preserved fish, including in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].
*The [[Elfsong Tavern]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] served melted [[cheese]] [[sandwich]]es along with [[pickle]]s, and twists of dried herring.
*[[Morgan's Inn]] in the city of [[Velen]] prided itself on platefuls of marinated herring with [[celery]] and [[olive]]s, topped with dollops of [[sour cream]].

[[Wizard]]s valued herring as its powdered scales were a [[material component]] of the ''[[secret page]]'' spell.
