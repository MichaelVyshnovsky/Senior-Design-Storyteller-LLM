        "mainbody": "Fang of Yeenoghu was a gnoll that had been been possessed by a demonic spirit, a gift bestowed upon them by the demon lord Yeenoghu. They were considered the Lord of Savagerys most favored servants.\nWhenever a Fang of Yeenoghu slew another creature, the victims corpse could in a sense birth new gnolls. Any hyena that feasted upon the remains of a Fangs prey would initiate a horrific transformation. The hyenas body would burst open, and a fully-grown mature gnoll would emerge from its viscera. This frightful metamorphosis reflected the moment when the first gnolls were spawned by Yeenoghu himself.\nFangs of Yeenoghu often wielded cudgels of bloody teeth, massive greatclubs studded with teeth that seeped blood.\nYeenoghus chosen garnered further favor from the demon lord by capturing mortals as slaves and dragging them down to his domain in the Abyss. They often served as shamans that presided over rituals dedicated to the Prince of Gnolls.\n* Cyhzka, the Fang that spawned the gnolls of the Cackling Chasm.\n* Krurg Mucusface, one of Yeenoghus servants who was captured on the infernal battlefield of Avernus and taken prisoner."
