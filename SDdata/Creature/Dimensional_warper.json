Master dimensional warpers had a tattoo of various symbols which encircled their head and down their back.\nDimensional warpers were naturally curious and possessed an urge to acquire knowledge.\nDimensional warpers had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of enlarge, haste spells three times per day, and dimension door once per day. Highly trained dimensional warpers could duplicate the effects of time stop once per week.\nDimensional waprers did not engage in combat. Occasionally, a dimensional warper on a observation mission would attack a group of adventurers, to learn all it can about humanoid battle tactics and their emotional state in battle. In addition to their innate magical abilities, a dimensional warpers claws and strong tail were effective in melee combat.\nLittle was known about dimensional warper society, even where they originated was a mystery.

Master dimensional warpers were the eldest and most wise members of dimensional warper society.\nWhat was known of dimensional warper society was that it was centered on the acquisition of knowledge. Nearly all dimensional warpers dedicated their lives to this purpose and as a result, most adult dimensional warpers were scholars. Dimensional warpers had their own language, and they easily learned the languages of whatever humanoids they were observing."
