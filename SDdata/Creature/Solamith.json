        "mainbody": "'''Solamiths''' were rare, gluttonous [[tanar'ri]] [[demon]]s driven by an insatiable, all-consuming voracity. They were bloated manifestations of burning hunger that charged their own flesh with spiritual fire, energy drawn from their prey. After devouring a victim, a tortured face appeared just under the skin of their bellies, a mere echo of the soul that begged for release.",
        "Description": "Solamiths were corpulent fiends that stood at least {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed up to {{SI|1|ton|k|long=yes}}. The obese demons lumbered around their imposing mass on their slab-like legs. They had pallid skin with bright green veins, and screaming faces that pressed outwards against their paunch. Their horned heads seemed to be cradled atop rings of flab and sagging skin, and their faces hosted a pair of burning eyes and a mouth full of flat teeth.",
        "Behavior": "Solamiths were stupid creatures, little more than animalistic savages; they did not collect treasure for they had no need for baubles and trinkets. They lacked the same arrogance of other demons, generally content as they were to prowl the [[Abyss]] as instinctive predators without care for the suffering they caused. The notable exception to their bestial ways was after a solamith had torn its victim to pieces.",
        "Abilities": "Solamiths were capable of tearing away chunks of their own body, peeling away their flesh before hurling the wads to explode upon their enemies. This \"soulfire\" was not only burning hot but also necrotically energized, causing injury even to those normally immune to fire. A solamith could tear of more of itself to increase the blast radius and/or make the burst even more powerful, but even removing small pieces hurt them.\n\nIn melee, they could slash their foes with burning claws or slam into them with their sheer bodyweight. Solamiths could also unleash a {{SIAdj|15|ft|long=yes}} cone of soulfire in retaliation to being struck, scorching their foe and pushing them back.\n\nSolamiths had the rapid healing and resistances commonly found in the tanar'ri, with the addition of being immune to fire (including soulfire). Despite having the usual resistance to the [[cold]] however, they were also vulnerable to the element. Not only was their ability to withstand it weaker, but frigidity ceased their regeneration.\n\nSolamiths could summon one or two more of their kind each day, succeeding around two-fifths of the time.",
        "Combat": "Despite their dull wits, solamiths had some tactical ability, keen spatial awareness, and an intuitive sense of how best to make use of their soulfire. At the start of every battle, they used the most devastating soulfire attack they could muster, increasing the area of effect whenever there were more enemies to catch in the blast. A moderately injured solamith still used soulfire, but held back as much as possible.\n\nSolamiths did not willingly enter melee combat, Though their great mass could make them seem formidable, solamiths were actually soft and vulnerable creatures that had to be kept out of harm's way. The portly fiends maneuvered the battlefield with startling speed so that soulfire could be used as long as possible.\n\nIf forced into melee, they would unleash a cone of soulfire to keep enemies at bay, doing so whenever possible and making sure to position themselves so that other enemies were caught in the counterattack. Failing that, they might keep using soulfire or instead batter their foes.",
        "Society": {
            "Habitat": "Although scarce, solamiths could be found anywhere in the Abyss, roaming the ruinous landscape singly or in pairs in their hunt for food."
        },
        "Biology": "Despite requiring no sustenance, solamiths nonetheless searched for food in the form of lesser demons, [[petitioner]]s, and, most delicious of all, mortal humanoid flesh. They gorged on those they killed at the end of battle, eating the fallen to replenish their own depleted reserves of flesh."
