'''Bats''' were a group of wild, flying [[animal]]s of generally small size that fed on other small mammals, [[insect]]s, [[reptile]]s, or fruit. Although the majority of bats were small, a few larger varieties existed. Bats were almost all nocturnal.

==Description==
Most bats were roughly the size of a small bird although larger bats existed. All bats were adept at perceiving their surroundings in the dark though the precise mechanics differed by species, with most bats using a form of [[blindsight]]&mdash;or [[darkvision]] in the case of [[shadowhunter bat]]s.

==Species==
There were many varieties of unusual bat species, some of which are listed below:
;[[Azmyth]]:
:A species of deep bats that could turn ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]''.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
[[File:Cute bat nwn.jpg|thumb|''A bat in flight.'']]
Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], bats could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]] and some claimed that they were more numerous there than in any other [[plane]] of existence. Bats also inhabited the caverns of the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 13: Blood Tor|Blood Tor]], the [[Abyss]]al realms of [[Beshaba]] and [[Umberlee]].

===Usages===
Some magic stores were known to sell the fur and guano of bats as a sort of [[material component]], both at a price of 10 [[gp]] per {{SI|1|oz}}.{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|60}} Spells that required a bit of bat fur to cast included ''[[arcane eye]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', and the [[illusionist]] version of ''[[continual darkness]]''.<ref> Those that required a bit of bat guano to cast included ''[[fireball]]'',<ref> ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'',<ref> ''[[Darsson's fiery cube]]'',<ref> and ''[[explosive cascade]]''.<ref>

''Circa'' [[1365 DR]], the owner of the restaurant [[Maid of the Moors]] in [[Mornbryn's Shield]], [[Beldora Thiiruin]] kept pet bats she allowed to freely fly around the dining hall, using the flying critters as a means of pest control.

Halfling kids often fished for bats using a light, durable twine string, and bait of live [[moth]]s.
