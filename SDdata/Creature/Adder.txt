Adder was the most common type of viper snake found in Faer√ªn.
Adders were scaled and highly venomous serpents, sometimes growing big enough to swallow one or multiple humanoids at a time. Some adders scaled were colored black, banded with thin grey stripes. Their heads had horn-like ridges above the eyes, the most distinct feature of the adder. Their venom glands appeared as slight bulging beside the creatures ear holes and fed deadly venom into their sharp fangs. Like other snakes, they had forked tongues that served as a tactile sensory organ.
