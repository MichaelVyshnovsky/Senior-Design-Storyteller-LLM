'''Adder''' was the most common type of [[viper]] [[snake]] found in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Adders were scaled and highly venomous serpents, sometimes growing big enough to swallow one or multiple [[humanoids]] at a time. Some adders' scaled were colored black, banded with thin grey stripes. Their heads had horn-like ridges above the eyes, the most distinct feature of the adder. Their venom glands appeared as slight bulging beside the creatures' ear holes and fed deadly venom into their sharp fangs. Like other snakes, they had forked tongues that served as a tactile sensory organ.

==Species==
;[[Amphisbaena]]
Amphisbaena were considered close relatives of adders or very close resembling them in the markings' patterns but possessed a much deadly venom.
;Black adder
Black adders were known for their deadly venom. A vial of it often went for 75 [[gold]] [[coin]]s in [[Cormyr]] ''circa'' [[1371 DR]].
;Black sand adder
The {{SI|6'|'"|long=yes}} long black snake found in [[Zakhara]]'s greatest sea of sand, often used as living weapons by the [[zin]].
;Common adder
Common adders could be found throughout [[Serpent Hills]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. The species of the common adder were known fo their 
sexual dimorphism. Male adders had greenish-gray scales with angular black patterns on their scales, while females had reddish-brown scales and darker black patterns. A bite of a common adder was venomous but not lethal for most beasts and [[humanoids]] of medium size. Their venom caused nausea and vomiting and could incapacitate a creature for up to for days after a bite.
;Flame adder
Species of adder from [[Kara-Tur]].
;Giant snow adder
A species of giant adder hunted for their hide that usually went for 300 [[gp]] and their paralytic venom.
;Puff adder
The puff adder was found in the [[Duskwood]] where it preyed upon the [[badger mouse|badger mice]].

Among the [[Domains of Dread]], adders could be found in Nova Vassa.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Lisa Smedman| title = The Awakening| short_story = | date = | editor = Richard Pike-Brown| publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = 1-56076-883-5| pages = 23| chapter = }}

==Uses==
The spell of ''[[melf's acid arrow]]'' required powdered [[rhubarb]] leaf and the stomach of an adder as its material components.

The spell ''[[fist of the adder]]'' transformed the caster's arms into adder snakes allowing them to deal devastating unarmed attacks with the serpents' bites. The material component of the spell was the shed skin of a venomous snake, such as adder, washed in tears.

Adders could be created via use of the ''[[sticks to snakes]]'' spell.

Scales from flame adders were used in the creation of ''[[flame egg]]s'', beautiful but deadly explosive magical items from [[Kara-Tur]].

Black adder venom was often used by [[lizardfolk]].

A fang of an adder was one of the components of ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]''.

In the 14{{th}} century DR, in [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Cloaksweep Alley]] one could find the old man who cooked [[ear oil]] out of adder fat, claiming it was a cure for deafness when poured into the ear.
