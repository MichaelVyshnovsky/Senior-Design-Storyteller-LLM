        "mainbody": "Rain linnorms were a species of linnorm, a group of very rare, primitive but powerful dragons.\nRain linnorms were massive, serpentine creatures that ranged from  long plus a -long tail at hatching, to  plus a -long tail as great wyrms. They had teardrop-shaped scales which were shiny white on hatchlings, and which grew thicker and harder as they aged and which, on adults, could change colors between white, grey, blue, or green at the linnorms will.\nVain\nRain linnorms made their lairs deep within hills, hiding their treasure within the dark burrows. But they rested within only when the weather was pleasant, preferring to sleep in open and be buffeted by wind and rain. Rain linnorms attempted to kill any intelligent creature that approached their lair. And if one suspected that the location of its lair was known, it would find a new lair elsewhere and move every single piece of treasure.\nRain linnorms were a species of incredibly solitary individuals, believing as they did that all other creatures, up to and including other rain linnorms, were beneath them. The only exception was during breeding season, when mated pairs watched over their nests. These pairs left each other and the nest as soon as the eggs hatched.\nIt was said that while rain linnorms could eat anything, their favorite food was lightning bolts. They had no natural predators except for foolish adventurers."
