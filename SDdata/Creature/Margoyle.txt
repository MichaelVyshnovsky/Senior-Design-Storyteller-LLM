A '''margoyle''' was a rare and more horrid form of a [[gargoyle]] that often led other gargoyles as leaders or masters.

==Description==
The creatures were so stone-like that they were not often detected, even when they were leaned against. Although they weren't so intelligent, they still gathered valuable [[magic]]al items.

==Combat==
Margoyles would often surprise their opponents, as they seemed so much like stone. They attacked with their claws and their pair of horns and bit with their fangs. They could only be damaged by magical weapons.

==Variants==
;Kapoacinth margoyle: An aquatic variant of margoyle similar to [[kapoacinth]]s.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|74}}

==Ecology==
Margoyles were mainly found in natural caves and caverns. They were able to speak the language of gargoyles, but they also had their own language.
