        "Description": "Despite being very large, these spiders had surprisingly small bodies.",
        "Abilities": "these spiders were capable of spraying a pale yellow [[poison]] from their fangs. They were also noted for their agility.",
        "Combat": "After spraying the nearest target with poison a spitting spider would pounce upon and whack them with its front legs to further weaken the victim before its toxin took affect. When being used as a [[mount]], they coordinated attacks with their riders.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], spitting spiders could be found in the [[Gnarlroot Caves]] beneath [[Sharandar]]. Around that time they could also be found in the pit fights conducted by the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] in [[Vellosk]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, an expedition of [[drow]] slavers from [[House Xorlarrin]] laid siege to [[Rothé Valley Village|a small farming town]] in [[Rothé Valley]] and employed many spiders in this effort, including spitting spiders.\n\nBy [[1493 DR]], spitting spiders could be found in many parts of [[Undermountain]].",

            "Habitats": "These creatures could be found in the [[Underdark]] of [[Toril]]. They were particularly known to be found in the [[Whispering Caverns]].",
            "Relationships": "[[Drow]] were sometimes known to use these creatures as mounts."
