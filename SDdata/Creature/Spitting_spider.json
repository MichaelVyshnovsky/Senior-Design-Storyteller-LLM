        "mainbody": "Spitting spiders were a type of monstrous spider that could be found in the Realms.\nDespite being very large, these spiders had surprisingly small bodies.\nthese spiders were capable of spraying a pale yellow poison from their fangs. They were also noted for their agility.\nAfter spraying the nearest target with poison a spitting spider would pounce upon and whack them with its front legs to further weaken the victim before its toxin took affect. When being used as a mount, they coordinated attacks with their riders.\nIn the late 15 century DR, spitting spiders could be found in the Gnarlroot Caves beneath Sharandar. Around that time they could also be found in the pit fights conducted by the Gray Wolf tribe in Vellosk.\nIn the , an expedition of drow slavers from House Xorlarrin laid siege to a small farming town in Roth√© Valley and employed many spiders in this effort, including spitting spiders.\nBy 1493 DR, spitting spiders could be found in many parts of Undermountain.\nThese creatures could be found in the Underdark of Toril. They were particularly known to be found in the Whispering Caverns.\nDrow were sometimes known to use these creatures as mounts."
