        "mainbody": "'''Shockers''', known approximately as '''vrrxlzk''' in their own language, were a type of electrical creature native to the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning]]. There were two distinct varieties of shocker, known in their own language as '''contented ones''' and '''sojourners'''.",
        "Description": "[[File:Sojourner.png|thumb|273px|''A sojourner out exploring another plane.'']]\nShockers were composed entirely of electricity and on their home plane looked to be ball lightning, amorphous masses of energy. The appearance a shocker took when it extended itself on to the [[Prime Material plane]], [[Ethereal plane]], or any other [[Inner Plane]] depended upon which type it was. Though both forms typically stood around {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall.\n\nContented ones appeared as bipedal, indistinct [[humanoid]]s made of bluish electricity and constantly gave off sparks.Shockers were presented in ''[[Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix]] (1992)'' as a single type of creature that differed in many ways from the one that debut in 1{{st}} edition's ''[[Fiend Folio 1st edition|Fiend Folio]]''. The later published ''[[Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix III]] (1998)'' presented this and an updated take on the original stocker as two variants of one species. As '''sojourners''' match the shocker presented in ''Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix'', most info from that source is interpreted as referring to '''sojourners''' and most information from the original ''Fiend Folio'' is interpreted as referring to '''contented ones'''.",
        "Personality": "On their homeplane shockers were relatively peaceful and only attacked in self-defense. While on other planes, shockers were very curious and inquisitive. They would take on a chaotic and unpredictable nature in order to test other creatures and study their reactions. And they were unconcerned about dangers, as they could only be killed on their homeplane, which could come off to others as having a poor sense of self preservation. Together these factors made shockers often unreliable allies and dangerous to encounter, giving them a bit of an infamous reputation.\n\nSojourners had a greater desire to explore and go beyond their homeplane than contented ones. They were especially curious about the Prime Material plane, taking any opportunity they could to travel there.\n\nAll shockers viewed time as variable&mdash;something that literally sped up or slowed down. Because of this they often had difficulty talking with other races about matters relating to age or the passage of time.",
        "Abilities": "All shockers had an innate ability to extend a portion of themselves onto other planes and to discharge electricity, either by touching another creature or by being struck by a hand-held metallic weapon. If this occurred to a contented one while outside of its homeplane, that extended portion of itself would dissipate. Whenever they dissipated,<ref group=\"note\" name=\"sojourner\" /> or were slain on another plane, a shocker would leave behind a bit of gray, metallic dust.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"sojourner\" /> This occasionally contained a few rare minerals or [[gem]]stones.\n\nShockers were unaffected by [[poison]]s, mind-affecting spells like ''[[charm]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', and ''[[sleep]]'', paralysis effects, They also had some resistance to [[fire]]-based and cold-based spells and abilities. And they could only be harmed by weapons that had an [[item enchantment|enchantment]] of +1 or greater.\n\nSojourners uniquely had an innately ability to discharge bolts of lightning from their body, similar to the [[wizard]] [[spell]] ''[[chain lightning]]''. These bolts lessened in strength with every creature they jumped between<ref group=\"note\" name=\"sojourner\" /> and lowered the sojourner's health. Sojourners were also empowered whenever lightning-based spells or abilities were cast upon them<ref group=\"note\" name=\"sojourner\" /> and [[water]] cast upon them would increase the intensity of their arcing.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"sojourner\" /> In dire situations, a group of sojourners would sometimes sacrifice some of their own strength to empower one or two among them. These augmented versions of sojourners were known as '''shock troopers'''.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"sojourner\" />",
        "Combat": "Both types of shocker attacked by merely touching their opponents. They fought in a very chaotic and unpredictable manner, frequently changing their choice of target and tactics. Some sages speculated that they did this in order to both confuse their adversaries and study their reactions.",
        "History": "It was unknown as to whether a state of contentment with living in their homeplane was the base state of shocker society or something that developed later on.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a shocker was a member of the [[Mindulgulph Mercenary Company]].",
        "Society": {
            "Habitats": "Though they were native to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning, there were sightings of shockers on every known plane; including the city of [[Sigil]] and [[Outer Planes]]. Extraordinarily rare, this later feat was accomplished by first extending themselves on to the Prime Material plane and then through either a [[portal]] or the [[Astral plane]].",
            "Languages": "Shockers spoke their own unique language, which was said to be frantic and buzzing. They sometimes learned to speak other languages, though no matter the language they never referred to themselves as \"shockers.\"",
            "Relationships": "Shockers were never known to try usurp the authority of the [[Lightning quasi-elemental|quasi-elementals]] that dominated their homeplane.\n\nDue to their fascination with the Prime Material, sojourners were often willing to act as guides to those who visited their homeplane.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"sojourner\" />",
            "Usages": "The dusty remains of a sojourner could be used in the creation of a ''[[wand of lightning]]''."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "* Inter-planar scholars speculated that shockers spent a great deal of their lives as mere lightning bolts, arcing at the speed of light through their homeplane's infinite expanse.\n* Some speculated that the gemstones that could occasionally be found on the bodies of slain shockers acted as some form of focusing mechanism for their energies.",
        "Trivia": "* There existed [[spell]]s that could summon shockers, though only a handful of wizards knew them and they were poorly researched. Thus, these spells could equally result in the summoning of either a contented one or a sojourner.\n* Some who knew of shockers, but not the Plane of Lightning, would incorrectly speculate that they came from the [[Negative Material plane]]."
