        "mainbody": "Corpse vampires, also known as pouncing vampires by halflings, were a type of vampire that emerged in the Realms following the Spellplague. The corpse of a humanoid could potentially arise as one of these if they were buried improperly, left in a place that was polluted by evil energies, or were robbed of their burial possessions.\nCorpse vampires had pale skin, slowly decaying forms, and a feral appearance. They were rather slow moving, except when pouncing around.\nCorpse vampires retained the memories of their former life. They often sought to victimize the friends and relatives they had in life.\nLike most vampires, these creatures possessed an immunity to diseases and poisons, they could see in areas of total darkness, and they could drain the blood of their victims.\nAny humanoid that died from having their blood drained from them by a corpse vampire would arise as one themselves on the following days sunset. Though if a humanoid died from a corpse vampire by any other means, they would instead arise as a zombie. These transformations could be prevented by reviving those slain, or otherwise by burning or decapitating their bodies.\nBesides their fangs, corpse vampires fought with sharp claws. They typically leaped upon their prey, most often doing so from a higher vantage point.\nUnlike some vampires, corpse vampires did not rest within coffins during daylight hours. They would instead burrow into loose soil and take a rest under the earth.\nIn the Shadowfell, corpse vampires could be found in Evernight and the Burning Woods, that planes reflections of Neverwinter and the Neverwinter Woods respectively.\nCorpse vampires spoke in bestial tones, often in the Common language.\nCorpse vampires frequently went hunting with other forms of undead or other nocturnal creatures."
