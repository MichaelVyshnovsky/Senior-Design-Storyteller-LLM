'''Tiger coral''' was a species of [[coral]] named for its coloration that could be found across nearly all the shallows of the [[Inner Sea]].

==Description==
This coral had a gold and brown coloration with striped patterns. It was a quite hardy breed of coral and grew at a rate comparable to [[star coral]].

==Ecology==
===Usages===
Dead tiger coral was frequently used by [[Ser√¥s]]ians, particularly [[locathah]]s and [[merfolk]], as a building material.

==Notable Reefs==
* [[Three Gates Reef]], one of two huge coral reefs that formed an ecosystem for the city of [[Myth Nantar]]. Measuring over {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} tall and spanning many miles, it encroached upon much of the southern half of the city.
