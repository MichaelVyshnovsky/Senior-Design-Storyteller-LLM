Tiger coral was a species of coral named for its coloration that could be found across nearly all the shallows of the Inner Sea.
This coral had a gold and brown coloration with striped patterns. It was a quite hardy breed of coral and grew at a rate comparable to star coral.
Dead tiger coral was frequently used by Ser√¥sians, particularly locathahs and merfolk, as a building material.
