A '''shrieker''' was a variant of the [[violet fungus]] known for the strange and loud noises it emitted to attract prey.

==Description==
Shriekers were [[human]]-sized mushrooms. They were similar in appearance to violet fungi, but they lacked the ability to move and did not have tentacles with which to poison prey. They could produce a loud, piercing, screaming sound that tended to attract curious creature (or adventurers) to the area.

They were immune to the poison of violet fungi.

==Behavior==
Shriekers could sense nearby motion or light and would respond with their namesake shriek. Each such screaming sound lasted between five and fifteen seconds. A patch of shriekers relied on violet fungi to kill prey with their poison, since a shrieker could not attack or move on its own. Like violet fungi, shriekers gained their nourishment from the breakdown of organic matter that had fallen nearby.

==Ecology==
===Habitat===
[[File:Two shriekers.jpg|thumb|''Two shrieker [[mushroom]]s.'']]
Shriekers thrived in dark underground environments.{{Cite dragon/150/The Dragon's Bestiary: All life crawls where mind flayers rule|12}} The [[Flooded Forest]] was a dark enough environment for shriekers to grow there as well. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], shriekers filled the [[Nemessor Tunnel]], an ancient highway in the Underdark that was once part of [[Shanatar]].

===Sub-Species===
;Hedgehog shrieker: Endemic to the caverns beneath the [[Storm Horns]] mountain range, these shriekers were distinct from the standard variety in three ways. First, their stalks were covered in fur similar to that of a [[hedgehog]], which tasted like [[sugar]]. Instead of reacting to motion or light, they only elicited their namesake shriek in the presence of [[medusa]]e. It was thought that hedgehog shriekers had evolved a natural defense against them as a result of the medusae's fondness for all varieties of fungi. Finally, hedgehog shriekers thrived equally as well in sunlight as they did darkness.

===Uses===
In the Underdark, shriekers were sometimes placed intentionally to act as intruder alarms. [[House DeVir]] planted a shrieker among every fifth mushroom surrounding its compound to ward off potential attackers.

Shriekers were poisonous to most creatures as food; however, the stomachs of [[hook horror]]s had adapted to digest them without issue.{{Cite dragon/131/The Ecology of the Hook Horror|42-46}} They were also known to be eaten by [[purple worm]]s, [[shambling mound]]s, and medusae.

Some considered their spores to be a vital ingredient in brewing a ''[[potion of plant control]]''. In [[Cormyr]], mushroom hunters often glazed fairy caps with the fur of hedgehog shriekers, making the mushrooms fetch twice their normal price.

==History==
Around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some time prior to [[1367 DR]], the [[Waymoot]] town of [[Minroe]] discovered the sub-species known as hedgehog shriekers.
