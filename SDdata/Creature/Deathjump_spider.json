        "mainbody": "'''Deathjump spiders''' were a species of [[huge spider]] that appeared in the Realms following the [[Spellplague]].Though not stated to be a \"[[huge spider]]\" in its [[Monster Manual 4th edition|''Monster Manual'']] entry, both the size and traits of this species match up with the defining traits of \"huge spiders.\"",
        "Abilities": "These spiders could not spin webs, though they could leap great distances and were skilled at landing softly. Like many spiders they had [[poison]]ous fangs. And they viewed their surroundings through [[tremorsense]].",
        "Combat": "Being unable to spin webs, these feral hunters relied upon ambushing their prey. They would lie within dark crevices, large trees, or underneath a thin layer of dirt and leaves that resembled a trapdoor. Once their prey was in range a deathjump spider would leap upon them.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], deathjump spiders could be found beneath the ruins of [[Cragmire Keep]], inside the [[Cragmire]] family's crypts, as well as around the the [[Ebon Downs]]. Around that time they could also be found in the pit fights conducted by the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] in [[Vellosk]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, an expedition of [[drow]] slavers from [[House Xorlarrin]] laid siege to [[Rothé Valley Village|a small farming town]] in [[Rothé Valley]] and employed many spiders in this effort, including deathjump spiders.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "In the [[Sword Coast North]] these creatures could be found in [[Neverwinter Wood]], in the [[Sword Mountains]], and throughout [[Silverwisp Swamp]]. They could also be within [[Toril]]'s [[Underdark]].",
            "Relationships": "Deathjump spiders were sometimes found in the company of [[ettercap]]s. The drow members of House Xorlarrin were known to use them. And the [[drider]]s of the drow city of [[Tel Verinal]], deep beneath the western end of the [[Moonsea]], commanded small obedient packs of deathjump spiders..<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/Tel Verinal}}"
