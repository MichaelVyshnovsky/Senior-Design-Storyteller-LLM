        "mainbody": "Deathjump spiders were a species of huge spider that appeared in the Realms following the Spellplague.Though not stated to be a \"huge spider\" in its Monster Manual entry, both the size and traits of this species match up with the defining traits of \"huge spiders.\"\nThese spiders could not spin webs, though they could leap great distances and were skilled at landing softly. Like many spiders they had poisonous fangs. And they viewed their surroundings through tremorsense.\nBeing unable to spin webs, these feral hunters relied upon ambushing their prey. They would lie within dark crevices, large trees, or underneath a thin layer of dirt and leaves that resembled a trapdoor. Once their prey was in range a deathjump spider would leap upon them.\nIn the late 15 century DR, deathjump spiders could be found beneath the ruins of Cragmire Keep, inside the Cragmire familys crypts, as well as around the the Ebon Downs. Around that time they could also be found in the pit fights conducted by the Gray Wolf tribe in Vellosk.\nIn the , an expedition of drow slavers from House Xorlarrin laid siege to a small farming town in Roth√© Valley and employed many spiders in this effort, including deathjump spiders.\nIn the Sword Coast North these creatures could be found in Neverwinter Wood, in the Sword Mountains, and throughout Silverwisp Swamp. They could also be within Torils Underdark.\nDeathjump spiders were sometimes found in the company of ettercaps. The drow members of House Xorlarrin were known to use them. And the driders of the drow city of Tel Verinal, deep beneath the western end of the Moonsea, commanded small obedient packs of deathjump spiders.."
