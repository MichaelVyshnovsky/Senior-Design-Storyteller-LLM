        "Description": "Sandlings typically measured {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. They were composed of silicates and resembled mounds of [[sand]] though they could change their color to blend in with their surroundings.",
        "Behavior": "Sandlings were known to intensely dislike being in the presence of most forms of organic matter.",
        "Biology": "[[File:Sandling-MCVII.png|thumb|273px|''A sandling wanders the desert, with three [[palm tree]]s in the distance.]]\nTheir body temperatures matched that of their typical surroundings, making them invisible to any creature that saw through [[infravision]].",
        "Combat": "These creatures were not aggressive and would only attack if provoked or stepped upon. Given their resemblance to their surroundings, surprise was usually on their side. They were able to envelop two [[human]]-sized creatures at a time. They could strike with an abrasive appendage.\n\nIf {{SI|10|gallon|long=yes}} of water was poured onto a sandling it had the same effect as a ''[[slow]]'' spell.\n\nSandlings were immune to all ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[hold person|hold]]'', and ''[[charm person|charm]]'' spells as well as other mind-affecting attacks.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Sandlings fed on minerals within the earth.",
            "Habitats": "Sandlings were known to be found in the deserts of [[Maztica]], the [[Raurin|Raurin desert]], and the [[Quoya Desert]]s\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], sandlings inhabited the many deserts of the planet [[Oerth]]."
