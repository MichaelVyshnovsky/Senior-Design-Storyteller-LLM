        "Description": "In their true form, doppelgangers appeared as tall, elf-like, gray-skinned humanoids, whose thin hairless bodies made them appear, to human eyes, sexless. Their heads were bulbous, with formless faces and bulging eyes that were a pale yellow hue and lacked visible pupils. Though even this form was deceptive, as it gave the impression they were physically weak, when in fact they were quite strong and agile.",
        "Personality": "They were lazy but cunning creatures, who killed or disposed of people then assumed their place. While not actually evil, doppelgangers were extremely self-centered and liable to look down on their victims. Because of their laziness and selfishness, they rarely ever had any interest in raising their young.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:FR Doppelganger.png|thumb|304x304px|''A doppelganger in service of [[Gornak]], shapeshifting out of his human disguise.'']]\nDoppelgangers could assume shapes of any humanoid creatures between {{SIrange|4|8|ft}} in height. After they chose their victim they duplicated the victim's form, clothing, and equipment, and attempted to kill the original. The biggest boon for the doppelgangers was the confusion their shapeshifting caused.\n\nThese shapeshifters were immune to many mind affecting [[spell]]s, such as [[sleep|''sleep'']] and [[charm|''charm'']] [[spell]]s. They also possessed a continuous spell-like ability to ''[[detect thoughts|detect the thoughts]]'' of their victims and opponents, which some described as being a form of ''[[ESP]]''. This ability extended out {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} and could penetrate most {{SIrange|2|3|ft}} barriers. These would often use this ability to learn everything they could about their chosen target.\n\nThough their abilities allowed them to physically impersonate other creatures, a normal doppelganger could not duplicate the languages, memories, mannerisms, or personality of their victims. Because of this they sometimes kept the original alive and close by for weeks when their plans were more long-term. While captured a victim's mind would be read daily by a doppelganger in order to learn how to best behave and speak without being detected.",
        "Combat": "Being shapeshifting creatures, doppelgangers preferred to surprise and ambush their opponents. Once engaged in close quarters combat, a doppelganger would use their brute strength to slam opponents around.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Doppelgangers were highly feared by most races for their ability to assume the form of any humanoid creature they encountered. Knowledge of their presence tended to make people very paranoid and suspicious of others. \n\nWhenever food or treasure were scarce they would work for other creatures, though they preferred doing business with the magically inclined. Many beings throughout the Realms were known to utilize them as spies, assassins, or in elaborate plots to usurp power.",
            "Reproduction": "Doppelgangers could only reproduce while in the form of a human, with another human; they lacked reproductive organs in their true form. Doppelgangers looked completely human at birth (though certain organs functioned differently), and remained in a human form during childhood and adolescence, during which time they were left to be raised by humans; this was sometimes compared to how cuckoos left their eggs in the nests of other birds. Upon reaching maturity, however, they changed and their minds were \"filled with an awareness of what they were\".{{Cite dragon/80/The psychology of the Doppleganger}}\n\nSometimes, however, a lone doppelganger lost itself and permanently assumed another identity. In such cases where the doppelganger had also taken up a romantic partner, the offspring that resulted were known as [[half-doppelganger]]s. Like doppelgangers, they were born in the form of their non-doppelganger parent; however, that remained their normal form throughout their lives, and they had more limited abilities compared to full doppelgangers.{{Cite dragon/313/Strange Bedfellows|93}}"
