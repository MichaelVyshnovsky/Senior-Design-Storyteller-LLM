        "mainbody": "A '''chaos quadrapod''' was a horror from the [[Far Realm]]. The creature was bent on spreading the disruptive energy from that plane and on causing destruction everywhere it went.",
        "Description": "The chaos quadrapod consisted of four mucus-covered, suckered tentacles protruding from a central body apparently made of pulsing light. The tentacles were responsible for the creature's movement, dragging it along while making disturbing slurping sounds.",
        "Combat": "The aggressive creature could attack its prey by wrapping and squeezing them with its tentacles, which could reach as far as {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} from its main body. It was also capable of unleashing some of the energy from the Far Realm onto an area within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, causing an explosion of sickly ethereal light that could temporarily stun all creatures within a radius of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. Chaos quadrapods were resistant against [[magic]]al effects.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1496}},{{AI-time}} a chaos quadrapod invaded a pocket dimension connected to a ''[[portal]]'' aboard the sailboat ''[[Dangerous Business]]'', following a confrontation between [[Dran Enterprises]] and [[the Six]]. The creature remained confined to the self-contained space while the ship was docked at [[Luskan]] for over a month, infusing it with energy from the Far Realm."
