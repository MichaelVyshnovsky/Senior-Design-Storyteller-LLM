        "mainbody": "Raggamoffyns were strange forms of sentient scraps of various materials including cloth, leather, and metals. They were found in Undermountain. The different variations of raffamoffyn included tatterdemanimals, the common raggamoffyn, gutterspites, and shrapnyls.\nRaggamoffyns disguised themselves as items made from the material they were composed of. Examples included cloaks, capes, piles of rags, and metallic shrapnel. If possessing a host they appeared as humans in dim light and were often mistaken for adherers or mummies in brighter light.\nAll raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victims face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyns bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creatures control.\nThese creatures could not speak but they did understand the Common tongue. All raggamoffyns were driven to create more of their kind, but a host was required to do so. The host would be enveloped and forced to destroy magic items while the raggamoffyn performed a silent rite that mysteriously created a new raggamoffyn. The host was usually not directly harmed during this process, though the raggamoffyn often forced them to commit crimes in order to attain magic items, the result of which could lead to the hosts getting harmed.\nAside from gutterspites, the other forms of raggamoffyn could not possess gnomes or duergar.\nThe exact origin of these creatures remained unclear. Some believed them to be remnants of magic items that were discarded. Others believed the Rag Mage was creating them using a cursed Manual of golems."
