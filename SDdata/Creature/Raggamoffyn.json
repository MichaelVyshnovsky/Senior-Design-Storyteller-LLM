        "mainbody": "'''Raggamoffyns''' were strange forms of sentient scraps of various materials including cloth, leather, and metals. They were found in [[Undermountain]]. The different variations of raffamoffyn included [[tatterdemanimal]]s, the [[common raggamoffyn]], [[gutterspite]]s, and [[shrapnyl]]s.",
        "Description": "Raggamoffyns disguised themselves as items made from the material they were composed of. Examples included [[cloak]]s, capes, piles of rags, and metallic shrapnel. If possessing a host they appeared as [[human]]s in dim light and were often mistaken for [[adherer]]s or [[mummy|mummies]] in brighter light.",
        "Combat": "All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creature's control.",
        "Society": "These creatures could not speak but they did understand the [[Common]] tongue. All raggamoffyns were driven to create more of their kind, but a host was required to do so. The host would be enveloped and forced to destroy [[magic item]]s while the raggamoffyn performed a silent rite that mysteriously created a new raggamoffyn. The host was usually not directly harmed during this process, though the raggamoffyn often forced them to commit crimes in order to attain magic items, the result of which could lead to the host's getting harmed.\n\nAside from [[gutterspite]]s, the other forms of raggamoffyn could not possess [[gnome]]s or [[duergar]].",
        "History": "The exact origin of these creatures remained unclear. Some believed them to be remnants of magic items that were discarded. Others believed the [[Fourteenth Skull|Rag Mage]] was creating them using a cursed ''[[Manual of golems]]''."
