        "mainbody": "Demonweb terrors were a species of monstrously sized spider native to the Demonweb Pits of Lolth.\nThese creatures had a poisonous bite, but could also spray their venom at prey.\nDemonweb terrors would use their webs to immobilize prey as they moved around and made bite attacks. Once a victim was slain, they were not above retreating with the corpse to feast upon it.\nThough native to the Demonweb Pits, over time these creatures managed to find their way into the Elemental Chaos and the Prime Material plane.\nThese creatures were capable of speaking Abyssal.\nThese creatures were sometimes seen in the company of driders."
