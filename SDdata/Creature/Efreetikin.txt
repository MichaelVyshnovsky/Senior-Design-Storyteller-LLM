Efreetikin, also called fire gen were gen native to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
Flame gen had jet black skin and fiery red hair. Their clawed fingers were in constant motion, as was the rest of their body. Forcing an efreetikin to remain still was a nearly impossible task.
Efreetikin were inherently dangerous and malicious little creatures. If not monitored closely, they would start fires when their master was not looking. They enjoyed going where they were not allowed and explaining the faults of everything they witnessed.
