        "mainbody": "kybleeders were a race of aberrations created by the Far Realm–warped creatures known as the kaorti to act as mounts. These monsters made up the invasion force that the kaorti intended to use to conquer the Material Plane and shape it to their desires.\nSkybleeders resembled little more than fleshy spheres with many tendrils, multiple eyes, coarse hair, and eight long yellow tentacles trailing behind. Three claws were arranged equidistantly around the midsection. Additionally, they possessed several air bladders they used to propel themselves through the air. However, most of their enemies or prey did not have a good grasp of what they looked like, because they exuded a thick cloud of white mist that obscured them from eyesight. Many creatures would not see a hungry skybleeder coming, their only warning being an ominous cloud and a rain of caustic red acid, before the swift killer swooped down and took its prey—if the skybleeder decided not to toy with its food first.\nDespite their monstrous appearance, skybleeders had above-average intellects and were able to understand the Common and Sylvan languages, and preferred to speak the Kaorti language. However, between their natures and the nurturing from their breeders, they also had a sadistic sense of humor. Some skybleeders would hunt for sport or simply to torture innocent creatures for their own amusement. The only thing that potentially rivaled their sadism was their pride. Kaorti who wished to ride a skybleeder had to treat it with the utmost respect, lest they become an airborne meal.\nSkybleeders were highly mobile and utterly silent, the windbags being much quicker than humans, able to effortlessly fly miles into the air, and extremely difficult to hit through their obscuring fog clouds. They also possessed a healing factor that allowed them to recover from simple injuries, unless the injuries came from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. Most significantly, they had the ability to cast several spells, including flare, shocking grasp, and wind wall at will, and others like call lightning, gust of wind, control winds, control weather, and cloudkill at least once a day, if not more often.\nAdditionally, due to their alien anatomy, skybleeders could not be flanked, surprised in battle, or become victims of sneak attacks.\nSkybleeders would often start by flying over a large group of foes and dousing them in acid, before diving in to rake at them with their claws. They would often grapple enemies with their tentacles and subject them to acid damage while restraining their victims as well, which was especially effective if the grappled creature was smaller than them. If a skybleeder was feeling particularly lazy, it would hover above its foes and rain acid while barraging them with spell attacks.\nWhen skybleeders were not being used as mounts by kaorti, they spent their time drifting far above the ground, descending only to find food or amusement by tormenting other creatures. They were carnivorous and favored fey above other possible prey.\nKaorti rode skybleeders by strapping a platform on top of the skybleeder, and then sat on the platform and secured itself in place by means of a number of cords. The kaorti directed the skybleeder with vocal commands and gestures."
