Rockfist smashers were a type of elemental of earth that were native to the Elemental Chaos.
These elementals were rather dimwitted and had a mercurial nature.
In 1479 DR, rockfist smashers could be found inhabiting Mount Hotenow.
In the late 15 century DR, the Banite Rezlus and his Zhentarim forces deployed some rockfist smashers in the mines of Tethyamar. 
These elementals could only speak the Primordial language.
Some of the more intelligent denizens of the Elemental Chaos were known to use rockfist smashers as guards or traps.
