'''Rockfist smashers''' were a type of [[elemental]] of [[Earth (element)|earth]] that were native to the [[Elemental Chaos]].

==Personality==
These elementals were rather dimwitted and had a mercurial nature.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], rockfist smashers could be found inhabiting [[Mount Hotenow]].

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Banite]] [[Rezlus]] and his [[Zhentarim]] forces deployed some rockfist smashers in the [[mines of Tethyamar]]. 

==Society==
===Languages===
These elementals could only speak the [[Primordial language]].
===Relationships===
Some of the more intelligent denizens of the Elemental Chaos were known to use rockfist smashers as guards or traps.
