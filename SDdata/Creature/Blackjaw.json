        "mainbody": "'''Blackjaw''' was a species of predatory [[fish]] that inhabited the [[Lake Glorfindar]] in the [[Starmetal Hills]] and remined active through the winter months under the lake's ice.",
        "Description": "These somewhat uncommon creatures had long [[eel]]-like sinuous bodies and large heads with massive mouths. They had green scales.",
        "Ecology": "Blackjaws were a nuisance for ice-fishers and anglers. They waited for a fish to be caught by an angler and snatched the easy prey before the catch could be dragged out of the ice hole. They were edible and were a part of a winter's hero's feasts served during the annual [[Simril]] celebration in [[Twilight Tor]]. The feast also consisted of cooked [[brown bream]], [[candlefish]], and [[durgrace]]."
