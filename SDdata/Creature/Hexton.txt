'''Hextons''' were the fifth rank of hierarch [[modron]]s.

==Description==
Hextons were shaped like [[humanoid]]s with long arms and six-fingered hands, as well as four tentacles that ended in sharp claws. They also possessed fan-like wings.

==Combat==
If forced into combat, a hexton used a combination of innate abilities, spells, fists and their sharp claws.

==Abilities==
Like all hierarch modrons, hextons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Hextons were able to cast [[arcane]] spells as well as [[divine]] spells from the [[Law domain|Law]], [[Protection domain|Protection]] and [[War domain|War]] domains. Hextons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.

==Society==
There were only 36 hextons in modron society. They could communicate with other hextons and with [[quinton]]s, and relayed their orders to [[septon]]s. Hextons were the generals of the 36 modron armies. Two of these armies served the [[Secundus|secundi]], three served the [[tertian]]s, sixteen were associated with each of the sixteen regions of [[Mechanus]], and the rest were at the direct disposal of [[Primus]]. Hextons could communicate telepathically with anyone in a 216-mile (348 km) radius.

Hextons were always created as the result of septons being upgraded to take the place of a destroyed hexton, or in case a vacancy appeared due to a hexton being promoted to the rank of quinton.{{Cite web enhancement/The Modrons|2-3}}

==Ecology==
Hextons were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within {{SI|216|mi|k}} and could see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}.

==Notable Hextons==
An unidentified rogue hexton owned a shop in [[Sigil]] where it constructed [[steel predator]]s for hire as assassins.
