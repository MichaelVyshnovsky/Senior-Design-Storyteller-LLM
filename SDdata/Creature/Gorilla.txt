The '''gorilla''' was a species of [[ape]].

==Behaviour==
Gorillas were highly intelligent animals. They were shy animals, but became extremely aggressive if threatened.

==Ecology==
[[File:Gorilla-Infant.png|thumb|273px|''A gorilla infant.'']]
===Diet===
Gorillas were a herbivorous species. They could consume up to ten times the amount of food an average [[humanoid]] could and drank up to eight times more water.
===Habitats===
Gorillas were found living in sub-tropical and tropical forests and jungles., especially in the northern half of the forest, as well as the [[Black Jungles]] of [[Chult]]

The gorillas found living on the island of [[Machukara]] in [[Wa]] had orange fur and were known for their aggressiveness.

==Uses==
Due to their intelligence, gorillas could be trained. This process was easier if the gorilla had the trust and friendship, either naturally or [[magic]]ally, of the one performing the training. Occasionally, gorillas were employed as pack animals.{{Cite dragon/187/Ecology of the Dakon|26}}

Gorilla fur was required as a [[material component]] to cast the ''[[Tenser's brawl]]'' spell.
