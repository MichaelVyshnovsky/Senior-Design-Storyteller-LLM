        "Description": "Ascomoids had a spherical shape and thick, leathery skin dotted with numerous indentations. They were capable of growing up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, though generally they were smaller than that.",
        "Biology": "Ascomoids generally took only a few weeks to grow from spores if a proper amount of water, warmth, and flesh was available. After which, they would break off from their stem and begin to roll around their environment.\n\nThe numerous small holes that dotted the landscape of an ascomoid's body primarily acted as form of sensory organ. However, when an ascomoid got large enough  it was capable of emitting from these orifices a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} long stream of fungal spores that was {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. These spores would poison a victim's internal systems, having an acidic quality. Though some could manage to withstand the infection of these spores, they were still liable to experience a degree of blindness and choking.\n\nDue to their thick, leathery exterior an ascomoid could not be harmed by means of blunt weaponry.",
        "Behavior": "Being a fungus, ascomoids were largely mindless creatures. However, if frequently fed either fresh or rotten meat by a creature they would learn to detect the feeder and regard them as a creature that they shouldn't attack.\n\nReceiving a steady supply of food was also known to cause the normally nomadic fungus to remain within a certain area.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1278}}, the [[drow]] city of [[V'elddrinnsshar]] fell in an incident that would come to be known as the [[Ascomoid Plague]].<ref> Victims of this plague developed large blisters across their body that would rupture at the slightest touch, releasing a cloud of the fungal spores into the vicinity that would potentially infect more people.<ref>",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Ascomoids were generally found in subterranean areas.\n\nIn the [[Abyss]], they were known to be found in areas with [[Layers of the Abyss|maelstrom]] terrain. They could be found serving the [[Zuggtmoy|Demon Queen of Fungi]] in [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], ascomoids could be found within the Underdark of the planet [[Krynn]].\n[[Category:Creatures found on Krynn]]"
        },
        "Myths & Rumors": "Despite ascomoids generally congregating in groups no larger than two or four, stories circulated that claimed massive swarms of them had overrun the warrens of goblins or the outposts of [[dwarves]]."
