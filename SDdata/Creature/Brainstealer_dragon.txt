A '''brainstealer dragon''' was a hybrid of [[illithid]] and [[dragon]], combining the best, or worst, features of both.

==Description==
Like most illithids and their creations, brainstealer dragons had four lengthy tentacles in place of their jaws. Above and behind these, they possessed two white, bloated and lidless orbs in place of eyes. Their draconic bodies were covered in small pale purple scales and their wings were reduced to fleshy flaps of skin.

==Personality==
Brainstealers possessed the conniving personalities and manipulative minds of their mind flayer creators. Most saw life as a game, and one they planned to win. To advance their schemes, they would use and influence the minds of underworld denizens. A few [[dragon aging|great wyrm]] brainstealers even had whole illithid communities under their control. They were more skilled in deception, intelligence gathering, and survival than their normal dragon counterparts.

==Abilities==
The brainstealer's powerful draconic build was aided by its diverse array of mental abilities. Like their illithid kin, they could use a ''[[mind blast]]'' to mentally debilitate their prey. This replaced a dragon's breath weapon, and got longer and stronger as the brainstealer aged, and they were immune to such powers used against them. They retained a dragon's aura of fear.

Depending on their stage of development, brainstealers above the age of wyrmling had all conventional illithid [[psionics]], being capable of making [[Suggestion|suggestions]], [[levitate|levitation]], [[charm monster|charming their enemies]], [[detect thoughts|detecting thoughts]], [[astral projection|projecting their minds]] into the [[Astral Plane]], and [[plane shift|shifting between planes]] (in either magical or psionic forms). Moreover, they were capable of telepathic communication to any language-using creature up to {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} away. Like dragons, they could learn to cast spells as [[sorcerer]]s, or manifest psionic powers as [[telepath]]s.

Their skin was immune to [[acid]], and grew in resistance to non-magical means of attack as they grew older. The downside to their transformation was that their "wings" were far less powerful, and so their flight was clumsy and more difficult.

==Tactics==
At the start of a fight, brainstealer dragons typically used their ''mind blasts'' to stun their prey for ease of consumption. They then grabbed them with their tentacles and commenced brain extraction, a process that took about 30 seconds, and usually killed their victims.

Unlike regular dragons, brainstealers could not bite or use their wings as weapons, but they could still use their dragon's claws with which to fight. While their tentacles were comparatively weak, they were long and capable of grabbing victims.

==Ecology==
[[File:Brainstealer dragon MtG.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A [[black dragon]] brainstealer.'']]
They were found underground. While they were capable of removing brains with their tentacles in the manner of illithids, it was unknown if they required brains as food.

==History==
Their origin was unknown, but obvious: scholars of the underworld believed brainstealers to be the product of an illithid breeding program, and likely one that not even their [[elder brain]]s could control.As illithids are parasitic creatures that take over their hosts, in the process of [[ceremorphosis]], this may be the result of an illithid tadpole being implanted into a dragon.
