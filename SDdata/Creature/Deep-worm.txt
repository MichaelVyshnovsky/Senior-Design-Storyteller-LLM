A '''deep-worm''' was an immense subterranean lifeform in [[Cormanthyr]].

==Ecology==
Despite being called worms, they had bones; those bones were huge enough to be used to prop up a corridor after the creature's death.

==History==
By {{yearlink|241}}, a deep-worm had attempted to break into the [[Vault of Ages]], looking for metal to eat; the [[Srinshee]] had used its bones to prop up a passage.
