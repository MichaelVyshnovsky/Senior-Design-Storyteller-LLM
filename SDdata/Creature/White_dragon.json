        "mainbody": "White dragons, also known as ice dragons, glacial wyrms, were the weakest and most feral of the classic chromatic dragons.\nthumb|left|190px|A review of white dragon anatomy.\nWhite dragons were physically the smallest of the chromatic dragons, even smaller than black dragons. They appeared in shades from white to grey and ice-blue, and in arctic environments, this appearance served as good camouflage.\nWhite dragons were physically distinguished by several features their necks were short and they had a flap of skin, called a dewlap, lined with spines beneath their chins. Their heads were very streamlined and featureless, and they had high crests atop their skulls. They have a crisp, vaguely chemical odor.\nWhite dragon toes were spaced more widely than those of other dragons, with barbed claws to aid movement on ice. Their very thin eyelids prevented snowblindness when observing arctic landscapes.\nWhen in the stage of being a wyrmling, white dragons had a less pronounced crest and small stubs where their future horns would be. They completely lacked the dewlap and their bodies were protected by a leathery white hide in place of scales.\nthumb|right|250x300px|Krydle holds a bundle of white dragon eggs.\nA dragon egg could be identified as belonging to a white by the greenish-white tinge seen when held in front of an intense white light, though it shared this trait with green dragons and any dragon breed with a gas or vapor breath weapon.\nWhites were the least intelligent species of dragon, and their behavior reflected this. They possessed minimal foresight or planning abilities, and their memory was rudimentary, capable of recalling only physical events rather than abstract concepts. There was one exception they remembered offenses committed against them and have a highly developed sense of vengeance and would often hunt down beings who crossed them, no matter how long it might take. \nWhite dragon vendettas were brutal and violent, frequently leading them into serious trouble. They were not inclined to plan or consider consequences, preferring a straightforward attack. This approach, while driven by their obsession with revenge, placed them at a significant disadvantage against foes who were capable of strategic planning and aware of the whites single-minded pursuit of vengeance.\nThey were not as cruel as black dragons and were not as ferocious as reds, but they were still competent in combat.\nWhite dragons preferred to attack first, then eat their prey, rather than pausing to ask questions. They did not often contemplate what to eat, simply choosing the most convenient prey, and would often freeze it after the kill by burying it in snow or ice for days.\nWhite dragons preferred glittery treasure that resembled ice, such as diamonds or light gems, but platinum, silver, and anything reflective or polished works of art were also popular.\nWhite dragons expelled a cone of intense cold. The cone measured  in length,  in width at the dragons mouth, and  wide at the base. \nFrom birth, white dragons were immune to cold. They were able to traverse ice as easily as creatures walk across flat, dry ground. Mature white dragons had several innate magical abilities. They could cast gust of wind and wall of fog three times per day. The wall of fog spell cast by white dragons produced snow or hail instead of rain. Wyrms were capable of summoning a freezing fog three times a day. This obscures vision within a  radius and causes frost to form, resulting in a thin layer of glare ice on all surfaces within that area.\nthumb|350px|A white dragon nest.\nThey were still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and had exceptional long-term memories. Adult white dragons had several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat they could climb ice cliffs with ease, fly very high and fast, and were exceptional swimmers. They loved to swim in cold water the more frigid, the better. Much of their diet consisted of aquatic creatures, even whales. White dragons preferred to scavenge for and collect treasure, rather than involving themselves in politics as other dragons might. Like other dragons, they looked down on others, and tended to view other creatures as prey.\nWhite dragons had active and inactive periods that were approximately of equal length, each lasting roughly twenty years.\nWhite dragons, as with some other dragon breeds, were unable to chew their food. Hence, to aid digestion, they swallowed small stones, pieces of metal, and even coins, which went into a small second stomach like a birds gizzard. These stomach stones ground down their food and were eventually expelled in waste.\nWhite dragons seemed to lack any concept of population management, feeding until an area was entirely depleted of prey. When this occurred, they were forced to seek food elsewhere, often encroaching on another dragons territory, leading to violent conflicts. In times of scarcity, white dragons sometimes migrated south from their icy homes to more populous regions, often already inhabited by humans.\nThis insensitivity to the ecosystem and their role within it likely explained why the active and dormant phases for white dragons each lasted about two decades. Without these extended and frequent hibernation periods, the dragons would exhaust their environment to the point of unsustainability.\nMost white dragons laired in ice caves, often dug into the side of an arctic mountain, on tundra, or glacial plains, although they did not need ice and snow, and some settled near mountain peaks or in forests. They could create their own caves by applying the breath weapon to tightly packed snow in order to transform it into solid ice.\nWhite dragons made their homes in frozen lands and ice-covered mountains.\nThe largest population of mature and older white dragons was believed to inhabit the area on or around the Great Glacier. Additionally, the glacier north of the Spine of the World range was also presumed to be home to a significant number of white dragons.\nthumb|250px|The wyrmling Calcryx in her underground lair near Thundertree.\nUnlike other dragon species, white dragons engaged in mating primarily for pleasure, not with the intent of producing offspring. If offspring did occur, it was merely a byproduct of their mating. When a female became pregnant, the male instinctively stayed to protect her.\nWhite dragons usually laid about eight or ten eggs in a clutch. A white dragon egg was incubated for fourteen months. The first three and a half months were within the mothers body. On average, between a quarter and a third survived to hatching.\nWhite dragon eggs had to be buried in snow or encased in ice while incubating. The parents did not bother to tend or protect the eggs in any way, although they would usually lay them near their lairs. After the eggs hatched, the parents parted ways. A newly hatched white wyrmling had scales as clear as ice, which became white as the dragon matured. They were expected to survive on their own from the moment they hatched, although some white dragon parents would permit their young to live in their lair until they reached adulthood.\nThe wyrmling developed into a young dragon after about three or four years, and then into an adult after about 100 years. Elder white dragons aged from about 750 years, while ancients aged from 1700 years, and the oldest white dragons lived around 2100 years.\nWhite dragons appeared to have no taboo against inbreeding, or perhaps no awareness of its consequences. As a result, they often faced the repercussions of inbreeding, including numerous infertile eggs and congenital issues, both physical and mental.\nWhen a draconic disease afflicted an area inhabited by white dragon, it often spread rapidly among their population. These epidemics served as a mechanism for regulating the white population.\nWhite dragons were not social creatures. The only interaction they sought with their own kind was for mating purposes. Occasionally, white dragon may work together, but this cooperation arose solely because their immediate goals coincided, without any prior arrangement or planning. \nWhite dragons were highly territorial, especially towards others of the same species and sex. Border skirmishes between whites were rarely fatal, though the verbal abuse accompanying such confrontations was often remarkably vicious.\nBack when her domains included winter, some white dragons were known to worship the Raven Queen.\nthumb|A depiction of a white dragon from Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.\n*Arauthator, also known as \"Old White Death\"\n*Arveiaturace, also known as \"White Worm\"\n*Cryovain\n*Glacialamacus\n*Ghaulantatra, also known as \"Old Mother Wyrm\"\n*Ghaulathator, also known as \"Wintercloak\"\n*Glazhael the Cloudchaser\n*Icasaracht\n*Ingeloakastimizilian, also known as \"Icingdeath\"\n*Mafelnoseikedehnaar, also known as \"Winter Fang\"\n*Thlaaklauthimir, also known as \"Freezefire\"\n*Tymofarrar"
