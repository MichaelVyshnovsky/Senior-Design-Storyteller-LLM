Spotted lions, also called cave lions, were a species of large, plains-dwelling cat closely related to the lion.
Spotted lions resembled regular lions, but were said to be 30% to twice again as large. Their distinctive dappled fur was dusky, as was the mane, with charcoal-grey spots.
This species lived on warm, open plains, but was rare outside of "lost world" regions. Otherwise, their diet and social habits were akin to those of the common lion. Including hunting in prides they were known to take prey as large giant elk or even mammoths.
Both stone and cloud giants were known to keep spotted lions as pets.
Spotted lions were among the felids that might be summoned by the spell pride of Nobanion.
Fracto-Nimbuli, a cloud giant in Chondath, kept three pet spotted lions.
