'''Euphoric imps''' were a specialized variety of [[imp]] that served the [[Nine Hells]] by bringing corrupt delight to the [[plane]] otherwise infamous for torment.

==Description==
Euphoric imps were {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} tall humanoids and weighed only {{SI|10|lb}}. They were terribly emaciated, with imprints of thin bones jutting out from their ribcages and bodies covered in numerous partially healed puncture marks. They had deep circles around their bloodshot eyes, feeble stingers, and an uneven, stumbling gait.

==Personality==
Euphoric imps were highly intelligent, but shifty, feckless, and lacking in wisdom. They had a taste for their own supply, as evidenced by their puncture wounds.

==Abilities==
Euphoric imps, like other imps, healed quickly and could see through darkness both natural and magical. They had a few innate spell-like abilities, allowing them to replicate the spells ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', and ''[[invisibility]]'' (on itself only) at will, and the spell ''[[major image]]'' once each day. Their unique quality was the hallucinogenic venom they dispensed from their stingers, a potent slime that left the subject in a dazed, euphoric bliss, unable to do much more than basically defend themselves.

==Combat==
Euphoric imps enjoyed combat, but were unreliable thanks to their fondness for their own venom. They preferred to sneak up on spellcasters while invisible and sting them.

==Society==
Euphoric imps were skilled alchemists, and acted as both private and wandering dealers to influential beings across the planes of evil. They were solitary creatures found throughout the [[Nine Hells]], and could also be summoned by the spell ''[[summon monster IV]]''. Euphoric imps spoke the [[Celestial language|Celestial]], [[Common]], and [[Infernal language|Infernal]] languages.
