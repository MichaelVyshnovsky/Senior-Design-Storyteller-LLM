It was constructed by means of shadow magic and "dark emotions".
The wraith eidolon was created some time after Xinkar was founded, following the Fall of Netheril in the . It served as a protector for the Netherese scholars for some time until the Uthgardt barbarians of the Gray Wolf tribe overran Xinkar. During the invasion, the last remaining resident of Xinkar attempted to activate the wraith eidolon, but could not reach it in time.
It remained in a state of dormancy for centuries until the late 15 century DR. A group of bandits broke into Xinkar looking for ancient relics and inadvertently activated the wraith eidolon.
Some time later, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge delved into Xinkar in order to recover ancient Uthgardt relic for the Forsworn. The hero dismantled the wraith eidolon once and for all.
