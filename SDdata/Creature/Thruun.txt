'''Thruun''' was a unique immortal [[Malar]]ite beast that dwelt within the [[Twenty Stones of Thruun]] of [[Dougan's Hole]].{{Cite dungeon/220/King of the Wolves|36}}

{{Quote|That monster came straight from the Beastlord's hunt, I swear it. You saw the hands hanging around its neck: Isarr's been killing people as offerings to that thing. He's got to be stopped before he kills again&mdash;because I don't think that monster's truly dead!|[[Kendrick Rielsbarrow]]{{Cite dungeon/220/King of the Wolves|37}}}}

==Description==
Thruun was a large [[ape]]-like beast who was the size of a [[horse]]. Its body was covered with thick shaggy white fur. Its powerful ape-like arms were clawed, and the face resembled a [[wolf]]'s, but it had no eyes&mdash;only a long row of furiously breathing nostrils. When summoned to [[Icewind Dale]], it wore a necklace of twenty hands, removed from victims as a part of the summoning ritual.

==Abilities==
Thruun was an immortal creature. It could be stopped, but there was no known way of destroying it for good. If defeated, it simply returned to the Twenty Stones of Thruun, and the summoning ritual needed to be repeated to have the beast return to Icewind Dale.

This wild beast was a carrier of a unique debilitating [[disease]] known as [[Malar's Fury]]. Each bite of Thruun had a chance of infecting its targets. Although it was not fatal, Malar's Fury could render the affected person unable to remain in the vicinity of blood without suffering terrible visions of Malar's gory hunts, leaving them disoriented and later&mdash;dazed.

Being a blind creature, Thruun was immune to abilities and spells that affected vision, such as ''[[blindness]]''.

==Personality==
Thruun was guided by its Malar-worshiping summoner and the Beastlord's own will. Its semi-intelligent mind could comprehend the [[Common]] tongue.

==Combat==
Thruun possessed tremendous strength and could break down wooden walls with relative ease. Thruun was laser-focused on its targets and attacked without mercy. In combat, it often leaped with lightning speed, capable of jumping up to {{SI|40' |'" |long=yes}} in a stride, thereby confusing and scattering its opponents. Due to the leap's speed, it could easily avoid enemies' attacks. Upon landing from the monstrous leap, Thruun gored any creatures unfortunate enough to be in its way. The beast's main weapons were its deadly claws and bites. When Thruun suffered a grave injury, the creature immediately retaliated in rage, rending the offender with its claws.

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1485}}, [[Isarr Kronenstrom]] of the [[Tribe of the Wolf]] pursued the favor of the Beastlord after being indoctrinated into the cruel Malarite faith by the tribe's [[shaman]]&mdash;[[JÃ¼tti Merliss]]. Becoming the Chosen of Malar involved performing a terrible ritual to summon Thruun. To do so, Isarr went on a murder spree, killing ten inhabitants of the [[Ten Towns]], mutilating their bodies, opening their chests and reorganizing the ribs to resemble the wings of an [[eagle]], then removing their hands.

When Thruun was summoned, it was sent to destroy the town of [[Good Mead]] that had earned Isarr's ire. The creature emerged in the Twenty Stones of Thruun of Dougan's Hole, scaring the villager [[Helga]] half to death. After racing directly to Good Mead, the creature attacked a group of [[adventurer]]s who were investigating the grizzly murders. After a long struggle, they defeated the creature as it exploded in spectral flames and darted into the skies.

Isarr Kronenstrom intended to perform the ritual once more to call Thruun back, murdering more innocents, but was stopped by the adventurers and volunteer troops from Good Mead and Dougan's Hole.{{Cite dungeon/220/King of the Wolves|50}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Locals knew very little of the Twenty Stones of Thruun nor about the fabled creature that slumbered within. Some claimed that Thruun was a deity from an ancient long-forgotten pantheon, while others did not believe in the beast's existence.
