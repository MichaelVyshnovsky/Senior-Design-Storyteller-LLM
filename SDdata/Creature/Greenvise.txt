'''Greenvises''', also known as '''greenvise vines''', were a semi-intelligent and ambulatory species of carnivorous plants that could be found in parts of the Realms.

==Description==
These plants were visually similar to a [[venus flytrap]], but far larger and sturdier. They had thick, green, trunk-like stems and four sturdy vine-like tendrils. In addition to these tendrils, greenvises had tendril-like roots that they used to move around. When their jaws were closed they resembled a mundane leafy bush, but once opened they revealed their interior to be a  mottled pink and lined with tooth-like thorns.

==Abilities==
Greenvises had an innate ability to sense any object or creature within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} that was in contact with vegetation. Additionally, at a rate of twice per day, if extremely hungry or injured greenvises would release a deathly [[acid]]ic fog out to {{SI|60|ft}} that was so dense it severely limited the vision of other creatures.

==Combat==
Greenvises were largely an opportunistic, ambush predators, due in part to their slow rate of movement. Whenever they recognized that prey was sparse in a particular area, a greenvise would proceed to reposition themselves throughout the day. They fought by using their tendrils to ensnare and pull prey towards the vise-like grip of their maw to swallow them whole.

==Ecology==
These plants were generally only active during daylight hours, entering a state of rest during the night.
===Habitats===
Greenvises typically grew around hills, plains, or marshes in areas that had temperate to warm climates.
===Relationships===
Some [[fey]] were known to cultivate greenvises and it was not uncommon for [[stirge]]s to lair near them.

==History==
Around [[1372 DR]], swamp striders were counted among the many creatures that one could potentially encounter on a rare occasion while traversing the [[sewers of Waterdeep]].<ref>

Following the [[Spellplague]], the inhabitants of the city of [[New Sharandar]] grew greenvise vines on their defensive wall, the Living Abatis.
