The vorr were evil and relentless bloodhounds of the Abyss. They were canine yet resembled felines, as well as rodents.
A vorr stood around  tall. They resembled a black hyena animal native to the Prime Material Plane, but with a face bright with intelligence. The monsters were covered with bristly black-and-gray fur, leaving their long rat tail hairless.
These hellish hounds were lurkers in the shadows, waiting for their victims to get close before lunging out and rending the prey. They would pursue and stalk their prey while observing and probing for weaknesses. When they did attack, they often flanked their prey. The vorr would try and knock their prey off their feet at every opportunity to gain the upper hand.
Vorrs were pack creatures and rarely encountered alone.
Vorrs were intelligent creatures capable of hunting and tracking prey over great distances.
In 1370 DR vorrs among with other tanarri were found in the Dungeon of Death on its Habitat Level subservient to the adolescent nabassu Visceris.
