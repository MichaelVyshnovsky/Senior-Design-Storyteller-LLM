'''Bluespawn ambushers''' were a breed of [[dragonspawn]]. They were dangerous hunters and sentinels who burrowed in order to surprise their victims.

==Description==
Bluespawn ambushers were heavily muscled creatures, said to be similar in shape to a badger (albeit much larger), with blue scales and a single forward-pointing horn on their head. Ambushers stood about {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder, and were {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} long and nearly as wide. They weighed about {{SI|350|lb|k|long=yes}}. Females were distinguishable by their slightly narrower heads and longer horns. Young ambushers had light blue scales, while older ones had darker blue scales. The very oldest ambushers would have scales lined with black.

==Personality==
Bluespawn ambushers were dim-witted, little more than beasts, but enough so that they could strategize in fights- and serve [[Tiamat]] and her worshipers.

==Abilities==
Bluespawn ambushers were valued as guards for their tremorsense, and they were just intelligent enough to understand and speak the [[Draconic language]]. Beyond that, their were naturally immune to electricity and could blast a burst of the energy at a creature within {{SI|10|ft}}.

==Combat==
Bluespawn ambushers hunted by burrowing below the surface of the ground and waiting for a creature to come close. When they sensed potential prey, they would burst out of the ground and use their electrical blast ability. If the victim survived the first such attack, they would burrow again and pursue (if it fled) and repeat as needed. If this strategy could not be used, then bluespawn ambushers relied on their claws and fangs instead. They would flee if severely injured, unless commanded to fight to the death by an evil [[dragon]] or a follower of Tiamat.

==Ecology==
Bluespawn ambushers worshiped Tiamat and willingly served evil dragons and other followers of her. They were valued by other dragonspawn as guardians and sentinels.

These dragonspawn preferred to live in warm deserts, particularly sandy deserts, and established a seasonal migration path between watering holes. They shared the draconic hoarding instinct and would bury any treasure they found near these watering holes to admire when they passed through.

Bluespawn ambushers lived in tightly knit packs of four to twelve, with equal numbers of males and females. They were carnivores who hunted small or larger creatures, although a single small creature could sustain a single ambusher for up to a month. After finishing a large meal, ambushers would retreat below ground, leaving only their noses uncovered, and rest. If another creature came to investigate the carcass of the meal, the bluespawn did not hesitate to attack them.

Bluespawn ambushers mated for life and produced eggs once every ten years. The females buried the eggs and then hunted after laying, leaving the males to stand guard. The males used electricity bursts to signal the females when the eggs started hatching. Both parents helped to care for the young ambushers. Bluespawn ambushers were much more aggressive when protecting a nest or young.

===Homelands===
Bluespawn ambushers could theoretically be found anywhere that [[blue dragon]]s lived, but most of the population in [[Faerun]] lived in [[Unther]]. Several packs there served a hobgoblin worshiper of Tiamat named [[Hurthoogul]].
