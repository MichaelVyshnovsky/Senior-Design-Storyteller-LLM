        "mainbody": "Giant crayfishes were a type of very large crustacean.These core sources &mdash Monstrous Manual on page 50, Monstrous Compendium Volume Two on page 29, and the 1 edition Dungeon Masters Guide on pages 180 & 224 &mdash all state that crayfish and lobsters are the same thing. While crayfish are similar to lobsters and are even colloquially known as \"freshwater lobsters,\" they are distinct creatures.\nThese creatures were six-limbed, low-bodied crustaceans whose bodies typically measured  or more in length. They were rather slow walkers, though very fast swimmers.\nMuch like a giant crab, giant crayfish typically hunted by hiding themselves, then rushing out to seize their prey.\nThese creatures were an omnivorous species, though primarily subsisted upon fish.\nGiant crayfish were typically found to inhabit wide and deep rivers the Stump Bog, and the Moonsea lake.\nIn the region of Kara-tur, they could be found on the Akari island and the river adjacent to the town of Kataburi.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, giant crayfish were rumored to be found in Phlegethon.\nThe meat of giant crayfish was considered a delicacy by many creatures, especially among nixies. Dragon turtles, giant gars, giant otters, giant pikes, giant snapping turtles, merrows, and storm giants were all known to hunt and prey upon them."
