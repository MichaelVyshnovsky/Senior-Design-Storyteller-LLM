They could consume up to ten times the amount of food an average humanoid could and drank up to eight times more water.\nGorillas were found living in sub-tropical and tropical forests and jungles., especially in the northern half of the forest, as well as the Black Jungles of Chult\nThe gorillas found living on the island of Machukara in Wa had orange fur and were known for their aggressiveness.\nDue to their intelligence, gorillas could be trained. This process was easier if the gorilla had the trust and friendship, either naturally or magically, of the one performing the training. Occasionally, gorillas were employed as pack animals.\nGorilla fur was required as a material component to cast the Tensers brawl spell."
