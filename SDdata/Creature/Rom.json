        "Description": "Rom were only male. They were tall and well-muscled with human proporations. All rom were talented artists of some kind and their voices were sad and resonant.",
        "Combat": "Rom viciously attacked anything that disturbed their dwellings. In addition to damage from their immense size, a blow from a rom drained the victimâ€™s strength.\n\nThe mere presence of a rom radiated fear to those viewing them, causing many to flee.\n\nWhen they had the room, rom threw rocks at their attackers.\n\nAll rom were immune to normal weapons, poison, paralysis, and all enchantment and cold [[magic]].",

During the night, loud lamentations could be heard from deep within the cairns. Beyond the Zakharan mainland, in the [[Crowded Sea]] they could be found on the island of [[Djinni's Claws]].\n\nBeyond the land of Zakhara, roms could be found in some areas of the [[Domains of Dread]].",
            "Relationships": "Brave visitors seeking refuge were sometimes accepted if they knocked on the entrance to these cairns. Anyone trying to force their way in was attacked by every rom dwelling within the cairn.\n\nThese musical undead giants were said to have inspired visiting [[bard]]s to write masterpieces. These masterpieces had the same effect as ''[[pipes of haunting]]'' if read or sung at night."
