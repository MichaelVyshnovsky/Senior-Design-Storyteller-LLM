        "mainbody": "steel predator was a metal-eating outsider.\nSteel predators were reminiscent of big cats with muscles made of iron. Like a big cat, steel predators were strong and fast.\nWhat was truly special about them was their sense of smell. It not only allowed them to track their targets but also allowed them to pinpoint it as readily as vision over close ranges.\nSteel predators were metal-eaters. Metallic magic items were viewed as a delicacy, and they usually attacked such an item&mdashand its owner&mdashto destroy it with their bite and then eat it.\nSteel predators had only one magical ability, their ability to sense the existence of metallic magic items.\nThey were impervious to harm from electricity and sonics. Because of their deafness, steel predators were also immune to any magic that worked by being heard. They had a strong resistance against non-magical physical attacks, as well as spells and abilities based around fire and cold.\nA steel predator could make a special roar every six to twenty-four seconds that allowed it to not only deafen people but also deal physical damage with the sound. This attack was more effective against crystalline creatures. The mouth of a steel predator was especially suited to destroying objects held by creatures. Its bite could also subdue a steel predators enemy.\nSteel predators who got the drop on their enemies tried to roar against them and then overwhelm them with attacks, preferably destroying their weapons.\nSteel predators had four legs but two claws that they could normally use for combat purposes. If one hit with both its claws, it could also use its hind legs to strike enemies.\nThey had skills in sneaking, hiding, and balancing.\nSteel predators were found on Acheron\nThough deaf, these creatures were capable of speaking a dialect of Terran.\nAccording to some sources, steel predators were the creation of a rogue hexton who had, after making the first ones, turned them loose on its superiors, leading to its exile. It then set up a shop in Sigil, where it manufactured the constructs for hire."
