        "mainbody": "Sea snakes, also known as sea serpents or water snakes, were an aquatic species of viper that sometimes grew so large as to be considered\nSea snakes largely ignored other creatures, attacking only when they were hungry or disturbed. Like any snake they feared fire and would retreat from open flames. They had a basic level of intelligence typical of animals.\nThese creatures had a venomous bite. When underwater a membrane on their snouts sealed their nostrils, allowing them to dive to great depths.\nSea snakes were one of the few species of snake to both have a poisonous bite and attack by means of constriction. Smaller varieties of them would simply inject their venom and then withdraw, waiting for it to take effect. While the largest of sea snakes were capable of coiling about small vessels and gradually crushing them through constriction. \nLike most snakes, these creatures lived solitary lives. However, on rare occasions there were instances of them gathering in large masses of hundreds or even thousands, often  wide and  long. The reason for this was unknown. Some speculated that it may have been due to seasonal migrations, others that it might have been a mating ritual.\nLike nearly all species of snake, these creatures were a carnivorous species.\nGiant sea snakes were found only in the seas and oceans of tropical regions. Smaller varieties of this creature could be found in shallow waters.\nAround Faerûn, these creatures inhabited the Sea of Fallen Stars and could be found near Waterdeep. In the lands of Kara-Tur, they inhabited the tropical and subtropical oceans, such as the Yellow Sea. As well as the southern portion of the Fenghsintzu River in Tu Lung and in the Ular River in Shou Lungs Kutuk Valley.\nSome sea snakes acted as servants of the marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.\nSome aquatic spirit shamans had sea snakes as animal companions.\nBandoliers, belts, and harnesses made from the treated skin of sea snakes was common among all the sentient creatures of Serôs. Their scales were also a required material component for the oars to snakes spell.\nThe bodies of these creatures were edible and considered delicacies by certain aquatic races of Serôs. One establishment known to serve fried sea snake was the Fiery Flagon in Waterdeep.\n* Shipwrecker, a sea snake that was owned by the shair Khadiga.\n* Some of the pillars in The Singing Siren had sea serpent shapes carved into them."
