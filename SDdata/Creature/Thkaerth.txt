A thkaerth was a type of woolly mammal.
These animals were known for their woolly coats and faces. Female thkaerths produced milk, and their mammary glands were sometimes referred to as "milkbags".
Thkaerth wool was used to make fleecy cloaks,
In the 14 century DR, thkaerths were known to the elves of Evereska. These elves were known to compare Vaasans to thkaerths due to their large amounts of hair. In 1371 DR, Galaeron Nihmedu owned a cloak made of thkaerth wool.
