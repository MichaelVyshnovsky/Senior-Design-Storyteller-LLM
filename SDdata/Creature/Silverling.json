        "mainbody": "Silverling was a species of tiny freshwater fish that was abundantly present in the Savage Frontier. These little creatures were caught in the nets along with bigger, more valuable fish, making them a cheap and simple food source.\nSilverlings had a very similar taste to sardines, a small type of fish found along the Sword Coast. Unlike their coastal cousins, silverlings had more of a complex smoky and mushroomy flavor.\nIn the hamlet of Mornbryns Shield, the local inn called the Troll in Flames served spread bread, a snack dish that accompanied alcohol. The bread was spread with silverling paste and garlic."
