A '''lich''' ({{Pronounce|litch|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}{{Cite web/Dungeons & Dragons FAQ}}}}), sometimes called a '''lichnee''',{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-05-29 - Lichnees and Lich Lords}} was an almost universally evil form of [[undead]] spellcaster of great power, usually a [[wizard]], but also possibly a [[sorcerer]], [[warlock]], or [[cleric]]. Liches were feared by mortal beings for their malign magic, their intelligence, and their willingness to embrace undeath for a chance to live forever&mdash;or rather, to ''endure'' forever. Lichdom was arguably the most powerful known form of undeath.
{{Quote|For inherent in undeath, and particularly in the state of Lichdom, is a reversal of nature's order. The winter that is the end of mortal life is a rebirth for the undead. The autumnal deterioration of life energy that precedes the mortal winter follows the rebirth in undeath, as the fragmenting of mind and body are sewn back together, resulting in a period of illumination during which the undead sees the world in all its brilliant facets. Finally, there is the Lich's spring, a season of growing power and vitality that can and will be sustained for an eternity, so long as their phylactery and physical vessel endure."|[[A Philosophical Treatise on the Nature of Lichdom]]}}

==Description==
Liches were generally gaunt and skeletal with withered flesh stretched tight across horribly visible bones, but they could vary greatly in appearance depending on their age and level of decay. If their eyes had been destroyed, lost, or rotted away, bright pinpoints of crimson light burned in their empty sockets. Liches often did not have lips or the necessary organs to produce natural speech, but they had the ability to project speech from their mouths [[magic]]ally, moving the jaw (if present) to aid the [[illusion]]. As their bodies continued to degrade over the centuries, a lich might eventually become a [[demilich]].

Some liches dressed in rich and regal finery and jewelry, others wore the clothes or uniforms of former occupations or allegiances, while many appeared to be nothing more than lepers as their clothes had rotted away.

==Personality==
[[File:Undead_Outlook_and_Psychology_by_Steve_Prescott.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''A lich grows bored after eons of study.'']]Those spellcasters who sought immortality through lichdom tended not to do so merely for fear of death,

The hallmark of a lich was that it had tethered its [[soul]] to the [[Prime Material plane]], and as a result, most liches retained much of the personality and even emotions that they had in life, at least at first. However, countless years of undeath caused memories to fade and the mind to twist. Eventually, a lich lost all shreds of its humanity.

The state of existing as a lich was not a pleasant one, and a lich was able to maintain its existence only through sheer force of will. However, over time this willpower warped into an obsessive drive to become more and more powerful. Many soon appeared borderline insane in their hunger to acquire arcane secrets. This fixation would often lead a lich to outright forget about its former life, and most liches reached a point at which they abandoned their real names in preference for ominous titles and pseudonyms. Perhaps because of this effort to bury their old identities, it was said that speaking a lich's true name could confer power over it and reminders of its past life were a good way to get its attention.

Liches were often proud and arrogant, demanding the subservience of all those around them. Many were also cold and scheming. In very rare instances, truly [[good]] liches arose,

}}Liches were avid collectors of [[arcane]] secrets and tools, including [[magic item]]s, [[potion]]s, [[spell scroll]]s, [[spellbook]]s, [[staves]], and [[wand]]s. They used these items extensively, and would design devious traps meant to ensnare [[adventurer]]s in order to add their victims' magic items to their own collection.

Whatever its goals were, a lich pursued them patiently and single-mindedly, usually relying on its cunning, its magic, and legions of lesser undead (which it would ''[[Animate dead|animate]]'' personally). Because a lich had eternal longevity, it often used this time to form schemes that took decades or even centuries to develop, sometimes preferring to outlive its foes instead of confronting them. As such, most liches lived in secluded areas of [[Toril]], where they were content with furthering whatever research or plots they had in motion.

==Abilities==
The average lich was a very powerful arcane spellcaster. They could memorize and cast spells as they had in life, and required the use of [[spell component]]s and [[spellbook]]s just as a living caster did. A notable exception to this rule was that some liches were able to permanently commit some spells to memory, allowing them to be cast even without [[material component]]s. Owing to the great depths of time they had to research and practice their magic, it was not uncommon for a lich to wield potent unique spells of their own devising.

Liches also possessed several unique abilities, such as being able to manifest ''[[coldfire]]''; weaken, terrorize, or even kill the living with a touch; drive the living into unconsciousness with just the sound of their voice; and cause fear, pain, or death with a simple glare. Even merely looking upon a lich could compel the weak-willed to flee in terror.

As powerful undead beings, liches were potent [[necromancer]]s and wielded great power over life and death: they were able to disrupt the life forces of those nearby and were highly effective at ''animating'' the dead, so it was little surprise that they often commanded small armies of lesser undead. Even good liches relied on undead servants and wielded great influence over the undead. 

Some liches could also regenerate, This spiritual form of a lich divorced from a physical body was known as a '''lichnee''', and it sought to reunite with and possess its body in order to resume its unlife. A lichnee was completely invulnerable and impervious to any attempts to harm it as it fled to its phylactery. It could also temporarily inhabit another corpse, which produced a [[wight]]-like creature that could only cast whatever spells the lich already had memorized.{{Cite dragon/26/Blueprint for a Lich|36}} The lichnee would thus unerringly seek out its real body as if following a ''[[locate object]]'' spell. Within seven days of ingesting any piece of its true body, this wightish form would metamorphize into a full lich body.

==Combat==

}}Liches were most dangerous in combat when they had time to prepare their spells and contingencies, and they usually sought to pit their enemies against lesser minions and traps before they themselves ever engaged. Before a battle, they would cloak themselves in defensive spells and summon allies. Once a battle began, they opened with their most powerful and wide reaching spells, hoping to slay or ensnare as many foes as possible. They were highly intelligent combatants, and thus adept at quickly adapting their tactics to a chaotic battlefield.

Liches preferred to avoid fighting in melee, instead leaving that to their minions or allies. Nevertheless, they were quite dangerous if engaged in close quarters. They were highly resilient, and their animating magics also made them very difficult to injure (and borderline impossible to injure without magic). Spells that sought to ''[[charm]]'', put to sleep, ''[[enfeeble]]'', ''[[polymorph]]'', or inflict madness or instant death largely did not work against a lich. They were further unaffected by things like [[poison]] or [[disease]], were difficult to ''[[Turn undead|turn]]'', and could not be affected by [[electricity]] or extreme cold; in fact, they radiated cold and darkness, and their touch was deadly and paralyzingly cold. A lich's bare hands could strike with magical, necrotizing power. 

A lich was largely unperturbed by light or by [[radiant energy]] that might disrupt lesser undead, although it could be destroyed and rendered unable to reform as anything but a demilich if exposed to the ''[[symbol of life]]'' glyph. Older, more withered liches were also particularly susceptible to fire. However, because a lich could not be conventionally killed, it often fought with little concern or fear for its own safety as long as it was confident that its phylactery was safe. For this reason, liches took great care in protecting their phylactery from harm, employing decoys, traps, and other defenses. When put in a situation wherein it did fear for its own safety, a lich was quick to ''[[teleport]]'' away.

==Society==
[[File:Generic lich.png|thumb|200px|''A spell-weaving lich.'']]Liches rarely left the privacy of their lairs, although some would travel to places of arcane learning and masquerade as a living spellcaster eager to learn about new theories and research. However, in general a lich kept only the company of whatever creatures helped to secure its lair, or other intelligent undead such as [[vampire]]s. Liches were also sometimes drawn to [[atropal]]s, but they rarely if ever served a more powerful master if they could avoid it.

Liches were not able to sire children.

===Creation===
Liches could not come about by any "natural" or spontaneous means, but as a rule all methods were secret and complex rites than involved the costly and complex [[Phylactery#Creation|crafting of a phylactery]] Acquiring the knowledge of one of these rituals often required making deals with dark [[god]]s or [[fiends]]&mdash;notably Orcus&mdash;who demanded service or fealty in exchange for the secrets. Only a living individual could successfully complete the transformation into a lich.

====Rituals====
{{Fq
| text = There are certain benefits this form allows me. I knew the cost would be great, but to me, it was worth it to end the torment. That's why I started collecting the things I needed for the ritual before I... died. I don't need your approval, nor do I seek it. I've justified this course of action long ago. My only regret is that I did not anticipate the reactions from my closest colleagues. I would never hurt them, but all I've received from them is threats and hatred.
| source = [[Makos]], on his decision to become a lich
}}
One version of the transformation ritual required augmenting the ''lichnee potion'' with a series of spells&mdash;''animate dead'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[feign death]]'', ''[[permanency]]'', and ''[[wraithform]]''&mdash;before imbibing it during a full [[moon]] in the presence of the completed phylactery. If and only if the phylactery and potion were perfect did the individual die and instantly become a lich, else they were simply dead and left impossible to revive or ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrect]]''. 

A more forgiving version of the ritual allowed the ''potion'' and phylactery to be prepared separately and over an indefinite span of time, however dying at any point in the process before it was completed required the whole process to be restarted (although the prospective lich could be revived by an accomplice). This manner of achieving lichdom caused the individual to undergo a traumatic transformation directly from being alive into being a lichnee. 

Yet another version of the ritual apparently did not involve a ''lichnee potion'', but instead relied on calling upon Orcus himself to bless the caster with lichdom. [[Lich transformation|This ritual]] slew the caster and raised them as a lich if successful, however this lich was beholden to Orcus, who had the ability to instantly destroy the phylactery of such a lich if he desired. 

It was said that the process and requirements for a [[divine spellcaster]] to become a lich was yet a different process, however it was overall very similar to the methods used by arcane spellcasters. 

There was yet another, entirely different process that spellcasters of more noble intentions underwent in order to become an [[archlich]].

In some cases, a flawed ritual might produce a lich with weakened or incomplete powers, or alternatively a mage with too little strength to seal their own soul into a phylactery might inadvertently become a [[boneclaw]] rather than a lich. Creatures with a strong innate resistance to magic were said to be unable to achieve true lichdom due to many components of the ritual failing to properly take effect.

====Maintenance====
Even once the process of transformation was completed, a lich had to continue to enact special [[conjuration]]s and [[enchantment]]s to sustain their undead form, such as by casting ''[[Nulathoe's ninemen]]'' on their phylactery once every 777 days and by continuing to feed their phylactery with souls via the ''[[imprisonment]]'' spell. Failure to do so would cause them to slowly fall apart. Some liches were also known to consume [[larvae]] to aid with the maintenance of their undead form. Without great care, a lich's magic would slowly fail over time, and it would generally lose both its sanity and its body after around 900 years of lichdom. Only very careful preservation or a transformation into a demilich might avert this fate.

A lich could only have one phylactery, but if it was destroyed, the lich could attempt to create a new one. If the lich was destroyed with no phylactery to which it could return, it was truly dead.

===Dooms===
Liches made their lairs in well-fortified keeps and crypts, usually hidden within the wilderness or deep inside twisting labyrinths. Sometimes these were places that they favored in life while other times they were purpose built to trap or kill intruders. Many, including [[alhoon]] and [[baelnorn]], ruled small domains in the [[Underdark]] of [[Faerûn]], which they often called "dooms" as a prideful promise to any who might intrude upon them. Such dooms never appeared on any maps, yet they were functionally governed by their lich overlord. Dooms often were located in abandoned [[dwarf]] or [[gnome]] caverns, provided that the old delves were large enough for the lich to conveniently move through and were free of any traps that the lich thought might harm it. Most dooms contained hiding places for magic items and involved a twisting labyrinth of tunnels and chambers. Within its own lair, a lich had even greater necromantic powers, able to lash out at enemies with [[negative energy]] or conjure the [[ghost]]s of former victims.

===Uses===
The ground-up bones of a lich were used as a material component in the casting of certain necromantic spells, namely ''[[soul scour]]'' and ''[[chill touch]]'', the latter of which was said to allow the caster to wield the same deathly cold hands as a lich.

==Types of Liches==
[[File:Lich.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[banelich]] and an [[alhoon]].]]
; [[Alhoon]] : An alhoon was an [[illithid]] lich.
; [[Archlich]] : While the overwhelming majority of liches were evil, an archlich was a spellcaster who sought undeath to pursue noble goals, and chose to do so by pursuing a somewhat different form of lichdom.
; [[Banelich]] : [[Clerics]] of [[Bane]] transformed into undead servants by the God of Tyranny. As baneliches grew older, their powers increased as well, until they were as powerful as any other lich.
; [[Baelnorn]] : An [[elf|elven]] archlich was called a [[baelnorn]]. They did not use phylacteries as their undeath was gifted to them by the [[Seldarine]]. [[Elf|Elven]] liches become undead to become backbones of their family. They were sources of magic, wise council, and guardianship.
; [[Demilich]] : This advanced form was achieved either after a lich had persisted for a long time and their body withered away[[File:Dracolich - Fred Hooper.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A dracolich.]]
; [[Dracolich]] : A dracolich was a [[dragon]] who had achieved lichdom. The process required to do this was discovered by [[Sammaster]], former Chosen of [[Mystra]].
; [[Lich lord]] : A lich was dubbed a "lich lord" if they managed to achieve an advanced form of lichdom through their own power and machinations (as opposed to it occurring from the passage of time or the intervention of others).
; [[Pseudo-lich]] : A relatively short-lived undead that resulted when a wizard's soul refused to leave their body upon their death.

==History==
{{Quote|Perhaps you can now understand why one lifetime is not nearly enough.|[[Szass Tam]], the lich [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]], [[1373 DR]]}}

The ''[[Death ward (spell)|death ward]]'' spell was said to have been originally invented by liches.

During the 14{{th}} century DR, tombs containing magic items might be warded against thieving liches with ''[[hands of harrowing]]''.

Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], it was said that a lich would weaken each time it was slain and sent back to its phylactery. This meant that it was possible to destroy a lich permanently by destroying it repeatedly, which would eventually result in its spirit being banished to the [[lower planes]] as its phylactery crumbled. 

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the lich [[Velsharoon]] ascended to become a god whose portfolio encompassed liches.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|149}}

As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], liches among the [[Red Wizards]] were highly active in [[Thayan]] politics, and took care to disguise their undead state in public with illusions and by taking more care than the usual lich to preserve their bodies. Places thought to be haunted by liches at this time included the [[Battle of Bones]], [[Castle Spulzeer]], the [[Crypt of the Wondermakers]], [[Myth Rhynn]], and the [[Smoking Mountains]].

During the events of the [[Death Curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, liches were unable to recharge their phylacteries because the souls of their victims were snatched away by the ''[[Soulmonger]]'' before they could ''imprison'' them. This caused concern among the liches of Toril, especially among the Thayans.
