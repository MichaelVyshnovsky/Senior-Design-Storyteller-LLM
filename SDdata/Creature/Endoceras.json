        "mainbody": "Endoceras, also known colloquially as sea javelins for an alleged behavior, were a type of large nautilus-like creature found in the Sea of Moving Ice.\nA number of sailors reported that these creatures would use their shells to pierce the ice when hunting prey. However, naturalists and zoologists were reluctant to describe such behavior in bestiaries, due to the penchant for embellishment that sailors often had."
