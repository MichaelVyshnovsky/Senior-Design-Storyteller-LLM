}}'''Lung dragons''', also known as '''oriental dragons''', were the [[dragon]]s of the lands of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Lung dragons were [[true dragon]]s; they gained power and enhanced magical abilities as they grew and aged.

==Varieties==
[[File:Lung dragons2.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''From left to right, a [[yu lung]], a [[chiang lung]], a [[li lung]], and a [[lung wang]].'']]
There were eight known species of lung dragon:
* [[Yu lung]] (Carp dragon; the larval stage for the rest of the lung dragons)
* [[Chiang lung]] (River dragon)
* [[Li lung]] (Earth dragon)
* [[Lung wang]] (Sea dragon)
* [[Pan lung]] (Coiled dragon)
* [[Shen lung]] (Spirit dragon)
* [[T'ien lung]] (Celestial dragon)
* [[Tun mi lung]] (Typhoon dragon)

==Abilities==
Unlike most other dragons, most lungs did not have breath weapons. Instead, they had other powerful magical abilities, which varied among their kinds. All lung dragons could [[detect thoughts|detect the thoughts]] of other creatures. They could [[Invisibility|turn invisible]] at will and [[Polymorph self|polymorph]] into the shape of just about any small to large creature that they wanted. Lung dragons could also [[Plane shift|shift to other planes of existence]].

==Personality==
Unlike [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic]] and [[metallic dragon]]s, lung dragons had a wide range of moral and ethical alignments.

==Society==
Most lung dragons were members of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], serving with specific tasks, depending on the species of lung.

At the very least, lung dragons spoke the [[Spirit Tongue]] in addition to the [[Draconic language]].

==Ecology==
All lung dragons began their lives as a yu lung. This juvenile stage of their life lasted twenty five years, after which they would transform into a different variety of lung dragon.
===Diet===
Most lung dragons could survive from consuming minerals alone, although some varieties did enjoy the taste of meat on occasion.
