Unlike most other dragons, most lungs did not have breath weapons. Instead, they had other powerful magical abilities, which varied among their kinds. All lung dragons could detect the thoughts of other creatures. They could turn invisible at will and polymorph into the shape of just about any small to large creature that they wanted. Lung dragons could also shift to other planes of existence.
Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, lung dragons had a wide range of moral and ethical alignments.
Most lung dragons were members of the Celestial Bureaucracy, serving with specific tasks, depending on the species of lung.
At the very least, lung dragons spoke the Spirit Tongue in addition to the Draconic language.
All lung dragons began their lives as a yu lung. This juvenile stage of their life lasted twenty five years, after which they would transform into a different variety of lung dragon.
Most lung dragons could survive from consuming minerals alone, although some varieties did enjoy the taste of meat on occasion.
