'''Pikes''' were a species of resilient carnivorous freshwater [[fish]], prized gamefish, and mundane housing of [[giant pike]]s.

==Description==
Pikes' mouths were filled with dangerous and sharp teeth, a threat to their prey and anglers.

===Varieties===
*'''Northern pike''': a subspecies of pike found in the far northern [[Sea of Moving Ice]] and unlike its freshwater cousins, northern pikes lived in cold brackish waters.

==Behavior==
Pikes were known for their aggression and powerful acrobatics when reeled by fishermen in.

==Ecology==
Pikes, along with other species of gamefish inhabited [[Doff's Lake]] of the [[Veilstone Peaks]], [[Cormyr]]. The lake teemed with life and provided the surrounding villages with abundant fish.

The waters of [[Akanamere]] bore seasonally-rich populations of fish. The fisherfolk of the city of [[Zutria]] had to compete with pikes for the catch. Thankfully, they often were helped by friendly [[nixie]]s who chased the sharp-teethed predators away from the catch in exchange for [[dried beef]] and squeeze bulbs of [[wine]].

The [[Oeble|Oeblaun]] fishermen often told stories of freshwater pikes and [[eel]]s that dwelt in the [[River Scelptar]]. These water beasts were big enough to swallow a human whole. These stories, however, were likely nothing but fishers' telltales.
