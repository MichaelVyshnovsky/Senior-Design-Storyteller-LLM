'''Alu-fiends''' ({{pronounce|Ã†L|oo|feend|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}}}) were the product of successful procreation between a [[succubus]] and a male mortal (usually [[human]]).{{Fact}} The male equivalent to an alu-fiend was generally called a [[cambion]]. Successive offspring from either (with mortals) were demonic [[tiefling]]s.{{Fact}}

==Description==
Females were, generally, attractive or beautiful, going to great lengths at times to conceal their needle-like teeth and diminutive wings. They often possessed a high degree of sexual proclivity. Males, however, were harder to distinguish, as its "cousin", the cambion (produced from a female mortal), possessed many of the same "abyssal" traits. This led to a diminishing use of the patrilineal- and matrilineal-influenced terms as a whole; rather, products of both partnerings were considered "half-fiend".{{Fact}}

==Relationships==
Alu-fiends were known to serve the goddess of bad luck [[Beshaba]], with two of the winged creatures being among the deity's closest attendants.

==Notable Alu-Fiends==

* [[Anderia]] and [[Estellia]], the alu-fiend allies of the [[nabassu]] [[Viscaris]]

Though apparently not the daughter of a succubus, [[Graz'zt]]'s daughter [[Thraxxia]] appeared in the form of an alu-fiend.<ref>
