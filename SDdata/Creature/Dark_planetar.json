Some were dragged down to the depths of the Abyss, while others languished in the Prime Material plane.\nDark planetars had access to both arcane and divine magic in their spellcasting portfolio. Among the spells they employed, were flame strike, symbol, dispel magic, heal, globe of blades, and unholy word among others.\nLike their still-celestial counterparts, dark planetars possessed inherent powers that made them terrific combatants.\nThey had inherent protections from all forms of physical damage, held resistances against to the elements, and near-immunity to all manners of spells and magical effects. Dark planetars could not be charmed, confused, or petrified. They were permanently hasted and regenerated at double the rate of other beings with the same boon.\nSome dark planetars wielded powerful, +3 enchanted greatswords that had a chance to dispel magic, nullify illusory creations, or even decapitate foes upon a landing a successful strike.\nIt was possible to gate a dark planetar into existence by use of the spell, summon dark planetar. This magic was only available to the most powerful, malevolent or neutrally-aligned arcane spellcasters.\nIn the , a number of dark planetars fell into the service of the powerful Bhaalist priestess, Amelyssan the Blackhearted.\n* Fazrian, a fallen planetar who served as the master of the Terminus Level of Undermountain.\n* The Winged, the leader of the Planar Hunters and servant of Szass Tam."
