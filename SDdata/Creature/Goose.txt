==History==
By the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], several dozen geese inhabited a pond in front of [[Caer Windlauer]], a castle in a cometary orbit around the [[The sun|Sun]] in [[Realmspace]].

By [[1358 DR]], famed [[hin]] [[Harper agent]] [[Olive Ruskettle]] came to realization that that her favorite dish was roasted goose (not [[horse]] feed) and drink - [[Luiren Rivengut]] (not water in a pail), after spending some time ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into a [[burro]].

In [[1368 DR]], an ex-Harper [[Gorion]] was killed with a goose feather-fletched arrow to his eye by [[Sarevok Anchev]] and his goods, sending [[Abdel Adrian]] on a fateful journey of discovering the truth of his divine birth.

In the late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Lanaal Featherbreeze]] a [[sun elf]] from [[Evereska]] was known to transform herself into a giant goose to aid her companions.

==Cultural Relevance==
* In [[1360 DR]], [[Hsuan Yu Wu]] knew a martial technique called the ''angry goose nerve kick'', that rendered the opponent's body too sore to move. The waved of agony caused by the technique lasted for an hour. She used the ''kick'' against [[Batu Min Ho]], her husband, after mistaking him for an intruder.
* Being said to be a goose or "goose-witted" was a derogatory term used by inhabitants of [[Waterdeep]] and the Moonsea that meant "dim-witted".
* [[Golden Goose Casion]] was located onboard of the ''[[Grand Dame]]'' vessel in [[Yartar]] ''circa'' [[1485 DR]].
