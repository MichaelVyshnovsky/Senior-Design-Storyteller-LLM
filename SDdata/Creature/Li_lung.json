        "mainbody": "'''Li lungs''' ({{Pronounce|lee|_|lung|refs=}}), also known as '''earth dragons''', were [[dragon]]s that resided deep inside the earth in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "Li lungs were physically distinguished by their enormous size, up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} in length. Unlike most dragons, they lacked scales, and instead were covered in a coarse black fur the texture of metal [[wire]]. Only hatchlings had scales, usually light green in color. As they grew older, the scales were shed and replaced with fur; usually by the time a li lung was a juvenile, the scales were completely gone. A li lung had an unusual appearance that look more like an [[androsphinx]] than a true dragon. Its body and tail resembled that of a [[lion]], yet it had a face similar to a [[humanoid]]. Its tail was adorned with colorful feathers similar to a [[peacock]]. The li lung was the only lung dragon with wings.",
        "Personality": "They lived a solitary life and rarely associated with other dragons, unless forced to under orders from the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]].",
        "Combat": "They tried to avoid combat, choosing to bury themselves in the earth until an attacker gave up and left. When forced to defend themselves, a li lung would use their ''[[earthquake]]'' ability to bury their attacker, and would engage in melee combat using their claws and teeth. A li lung would roar continuously while attacking, which sounded like metal scraping on stone. Attackers would be near-deafened by this. While airborne, a li lung was very maneuverable no matter their size, and it was able to perform wing-over maneuvers, allowing them to make a turn of 120 to 140 degrees.",
        "Abilities": "Li lungs had a natural immunity to earthquakes and had innate magical abilities, each gained as they grew older. Three time a day, a mature li lung could use ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', and ''[[wall of stone]]''. Once a day, a mature li lung could use ''[[disintegrate]]'' and ''[[flesh to stone]]''.",
        "Ecology": "A li lung's diet consisted of earth, stone, and minerals. They were particularly fond of consuming precious metals such as [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Li lungs made their home in labyrinthine caverns deep underground, far from civilization.",
        "Celestial Bureaucracy": "Within the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], li lungs controlled the powers of the earth.",
        "Lands": "In the 1350s [[DR]], several li lung laired in the [[Satoyama]] mountains on the island of [[Shinkoku]] in [[Kozakura]]. They had befriended Lady [[Sato Kitashi]] by [[1357 DR]].<ref> Dragon-hunters usually steered clear of these li lungâ€”[[wu jen]] warned that their earthquake power might also awaken the great [[Earth Dragon]] that slumbered beneath Shinkoku, which would be catastrophic for all.<ref>"
