A '''pheasant''' was a common [[animal]] of the [[Realms]], and their flesh was often cooked and eaten.

==Description==
Pheasants were small birds that were hunted, and consumed by a variety of beings. They kept to dense foliage, and squawked when frightened or surprised. Their [[egg]]s were olive green in coloration and had a slightly stronger flavor than those of [[chicken|hens]].{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|93}}

==History==
''Circa'' [[1345 DR]], pheasants were considered common game, as were [[quail]]. [[Arlen]] and [[Pawldo]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]] managed to shoot twelve such birds with their [[bow]]s and [[arrow]]s over the course of a few days.

==Ecology==

===Habitats===
They were known to dwell in several places in [[Faer√ªn]], including [[Cormanthor]], the [[Western Heartlands]], the Moonshae Isles, [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], the [[Dales]], and [[the North]].

During the winter, they would gather beneath clumps of shrubs, such as [[huckleberry]] bushes, for warmth.
===Relationships===
Pheasants were hunted not only by [[human]]s, but also by monsters such as [[stirge]]s. Once caught by more civilized races, they were hung and left to bleed, and then cleaned. The pheasants could then be cooked in a variety of ways. For example, they were used in soups like [[pheasant tail soup]], named for the three pheasant feathers stood upright beside the [[bowl]] as adornment. As pheasants were not always available, other game fowl and even rodents might be substituted in the stock. Another method was to roast the bird on a [[skewer]]. Locals of [[Swords Meet]] claimed that pheasant, which was roasted to crackling, served alongside apples, dark applecake, and a layer of mushrooms was a most rare delicacy.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 22: Night Ale at the Meet|28}} After being cooked, they were sometimes covered in gravy. Pheasant and other fowl could even be used as stuffing for roasts of other beasts, as in [[Fendarl's Gate]].

Envoys of [[Alustriel Silverhand]] were known to bestow skewers of roast pheasant and [[wine]] upon parties venturing out of [[Silverymoon]].

''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold pheasant feathers in bundles of five for 3 [[silver piece]]s. [[Maerlbar Eggs & Fresh Fowl]] sold live, plucked, and lightly roasted pheasants.

==Rumors and Legends==
The hunters of [[Silverymoon]] believed in a mythical "silver pheasant".
