Chameleons were lizards famous for their ability to change their skin color to match their surroundings.
The elven trickster god Erevan Ilesere went by the title "The Chameleon".
The color-changing power of the chameleon inspired the name of certain magical items, for example, the rings of chameleon power said to be worn by Akim al-Kalaas, leader of the Unclean Nabilanasa, a famed elven ranger of the Zakharan desert and even avatars of the goddess Eilistraee.
Despite the name, chameleon leather, a color-changing armor, was crafted from ophidians, not chameleons.
In Maztica, the skin of a chameleon was required for the proper casting of the disguise spell.
