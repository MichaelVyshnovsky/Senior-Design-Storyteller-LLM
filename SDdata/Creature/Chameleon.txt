'''Chameleons''' were [[lizard]]s famous for their ability to change their skin color to match their surroundings.

==Reputation==
The [[Elf|elven]] trickster god [[Erevan Ilesere]] went by the title "The Chameleon".

The color-changing power of the chameleon inspired the name of certain magical items, for example, the [[ring of chameleon power|''rings of chameleon power'']] said to be worn by [[Akim al-Kalaas]], leader of the [[Unclean (Zakhara)|Unclean]];{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Cardsheets}} [[Nabilanasa]], a famed elven [[ranger]] of the [[Zakhara]]n desert;{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|196|Nabilanasa}} and even [[avatar]]s of the goddess [[Eilistraee]].

Despite the name, [[chameleon leather]], a color-changing armor, was crafted from [[ophidian]]s, not chameleons.

==Uses==
In [[Maztica]], the skin of a chameleon was required for the proper casting of the ''[[disguise]]'' spell.
