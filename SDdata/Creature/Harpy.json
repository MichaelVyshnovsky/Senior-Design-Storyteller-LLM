        "mainbody": "A '''harpy''' ({{Plural|harpies}}) was a malign race of [[monstrous humanoid]] winged creatures. A group of them was referred to as either a \"flock\"<ref> or a \"gaggle\".<ref>",
        "Description": "A harpy had the upper body of a female [[humanoid]] and the lower body of an reptilian creature, with scaly legs, clawed feet, and clawed hands with knotty fingers. Harpies had coal-black eyes in faces like cruel old women, with hair that was filthy, tangled, and crusted with old dry blood. They possessed powerful leathery wings with which they could fly and carry away their victims.In 2nd-edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', harpies had the torso and head of a woman, but the legs of a vulture.\n\nHarpies did not wear any clothing, but would adorn themselves with jewelry or trinkets from their victims.\n\nThere was no physical difference between male and female harpies. The males possessed breasts just like the females did, leading to the misconception that male harpies did not exist.",
        "Personality": "Harpies were notoriously malevolent and sadistic, taking enormous joy in hurting, torturing and killing their victims, and were always seeking more. They were fond of entrancing travelers with their songs and luring them to shockingly cruel dooms. When they were done playing with their captives, they slew them and finally devoured them.\n\nThey were not particularly intelligent creatures, and were prone to cowardice in the face of superior power.",
        "Abilities": "The deadliest power of the harpy was its insidious and captivating song. A harpy's song, while it was heard, acted like a [[charm]] affecting all non-harpies up to {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} away. It took an effort to will to resist; those who did could count themselves safe for a day, at least from that one harpy's song. In those who succumbed, it induced a trance-like state in which the victim was compelled to move directly towards the harpy. If dangers obstructed their path, they could shake off the effect, but if they could not, they could do little but try to protect themselves. However, once within reach of the harpy, the victim was at the harpy's mercy and made no attempt at defending themselves. Creatures who could not hear were unaffected by the magical song. [[Elves]] were naturally resistant to the effects of the harpy's song.{{Cite dragon/115/The Ecology of the Harpy: Songs of beauty...}}\n\nThey had keen hearing and skills in deceit, intimidation, and, curiously, oratory.",
        "Combat": "Harpies used primitive weapons, usually big bones wielded as improvised [[club]]s, but a few harpy archers mastered the use of [[bow]]s. Otherwise, they could also bite and attack with their claws. They often attacked on the wing, striking with their weapons. They had no preference over their victims, and enjoyed the killing and torture of any creature.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "[[File:Harvest of Horrors Haradan 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''A harpy attacking a villager in Vanesci Hamlet.'']]\nHarpies with long tails were known to dwell in and around the [[Kingdom of Nix]], a [[goblin]] realm that lay upon the high [[Forbidden Plateau]] in the [[Utter East]], beside a glacier in the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]] of the [[Yehimal]]. The harpies of Nix were known to be merciless hunters.\n\nHarpies were also known to be in the many forests and jungles of [[Maztica]]."
        },
        "History": "Harpies living within the [[Kingdom of Nix]] were instrumental in [[Redfang|Redfang the Reaper]]'s reign of terror over [[Vanesci Hamlet]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]]. Swooping down from high in the skies they would kidnap villagers in nets, carrying them away and eventually dropping them into the cauldrons of Nix. The demise of their hapless victims produced a burst of [[mana]] that powered the kingdom's [[bloodforge]]s."
