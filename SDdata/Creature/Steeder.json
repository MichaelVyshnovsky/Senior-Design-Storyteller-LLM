        "mainbody": "'''Steeders''' were a species of [[giant spider]] found in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "Steeders were giant spiders, sharing many physical characteristics of their smaller cousins. Their bodies were covered in a fine fur that varied in color. They had eight powerful legs and large mandibles.",
        "Combat": "A common tactic used by [[duergar]] cavalry was to ambush a target and charge in, using the steeder's mass to smash a target against a wall or push them over a cliff. Steeders instinctively used their mandibles to bite a target.",
        "Abilities": "Thanks to their strong legs, steeders were excellent jumpers. They were capable of leaping {{SIrange|24|30|ft}} in any direction.Steeders were stated as lacking a poisonous bite in ''[[The Mines of Bloodstone]]'' and ''[[Monstrous Compendium Volume Two]]''. In 3{{rd}} edtion, they were given this ability in ''[[Races of Faer√ªn]]'' and it carried over into 5{{th}} edition with ''[[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]''. Steeders had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[invisibility]]'' [[spell]] once per day, which also affected their duergar rider. Steeders walked on ceilings and walls using a sticky substance secreted from the base of their legs.",
        "Behavior": "Steeders were predatory and aggressive, even to one another. A steeder would instantly attempt to attack another steeder. Due to this, they are stabled in individual stalls and blinders were used when more than one steeder was used in a caravan or battle group. Steeders were capable of being trained to respond to both hand and verbal commands.",
        "Society": "Steeders were domesticated by the duergar and employed as mounts. Female steeders were used in battle while the smaller males were used to transport cargo. A steeder was able to transport between {{SIrange|300|900|lb|k}} of cargo or equipment. Unlike other dray animals, steeders would not pull a wagon. A duergar rode on the back of the steeder in a specialized saddle made from [[leather]]. Connected to this saddle was a complicated system of prods and straps, which allowed the duergar to control and direct the steeder.\n\nThere was demand for steeder eggs, with an individual egg fetching up to 500 [[gp]] at the market. By the 1370s DR, the sale of steeder eggs was permitted to non-duergar races. Steeders had to be properly trained and a steeder trainer was considered a professional trade among the duergar. An experienced steeder trainer could charge up to 1,000 gp for their services.",
        "Ecology": "Female steeders were both larger and stronger than males. They tolerated each other during mating, but afterwards the female devoured the male. Once hatched, a newborn steeder reached maturity within six months. Steeders were obligate carnivores. Steeders were selectively bred by the duergar from giant hunting spiders that were common in the Underdark. As a result, steeders were far more intelligent than their ancestors."
