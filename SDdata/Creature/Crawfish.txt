Crawfish was a species of small freshwater crustacean fund in northern regions of Faer√ªn.
Crayfish was one of the major products of the backwater hamlet called Pilvers Creek in the Moonsea region and the tiny community of Ulgoths Beard on the Sword Coast. Smaller species of crayfish inhabited the waters of Lake Sember in Cormanthyr The reservoirs of the meadow called Halendos in Aglarond were home to crayfish.
A species of crawfish was known to inhabited bodies of water in the Underdark.
The Painted Boat Restaurant in Ravens Bluff sold cooked river crayfish for mere five silver pieces.
At some point in Cormyrs past, people of Nesmyth brought popper crayfish over from from the Wyvernwater to the Starwater River. This changed the rivers biome. The most fish in the lower Starwater was consumed by the crayfish and the abundance of these frustrations attracted electric eels that fed on them.
