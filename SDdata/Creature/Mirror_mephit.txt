A mirror mephit was a rare kind of mephit that originated from the Plane of Mirrors.
Mirror mephits were small outsiders native to the Plane of Mirrors. They had jet-black eyes and a fully reflective body. Like other mephits, they had sets of claws and wings, though these mephits had wings that appeared much like glass. A damaged mirror mephit may have appeared cracked and chipped, like a block of marble.
Compared to other mephits, mirror mephits were intrigued by certain objects. They enjoyed the spectacles of reflection and often engaged in repetitive acts. They had no interest in politics or following a moral code instead, they acted without caring for the future. Mirror mephits were incredibly fond of glittery, sparkling, and shiny items.
Mirror mephits were skilled in covert operations and summoning other creatures. These rare mephits attacked with glass darts and a breath weapon when doing so, sharp shards of glass were exerted from the mephits, piercing their foes. Mirror mephits had a chance of summoning another mirror mephit to aid them in combat. They were immune to to electricity, poison, and cold-based spells, however, they were vulnerable to sonic spells and bludgeoning weapons. As well as their resistances, they were surprising well armored, could regenerate, and were naturally able to reflect spells. In death, mirror mephits would shatter.
Mirrors mephits were used by a few factions across Faer√ªn. They were a particularly favorite summon of the Red Wizards of Thay. Such wizards would command the outsiders to attach reflective material to their possessions and equipment. This way, the mirrors would allow these mephits to watch their owners from the Plane of Mirrors. In addition to the Red Wizards, the Zhentarim, particularly the demons they had allied with, made use of mirror mephits. In such a case, they were usually used as spies.
