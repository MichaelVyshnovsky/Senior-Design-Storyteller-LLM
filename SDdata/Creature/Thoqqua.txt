Thoqqua (), also called rock worms, were worm-like elementals native to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
A thoqquas long body was hot enough to melt rock.
Thoqqua were foul-tempered. They spent most of their time burrowing underground in search of minerals to eat.
Thoqqua used their bodies to slam their enemies. This was particularly effective because the touch of a thoqqua resulted in fire damage.
Thoqqua were natives of the Elemental Plane of Fire
They were usually found alone or in pairs.
