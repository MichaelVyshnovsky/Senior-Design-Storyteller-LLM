        "mainbody": "The Whiteshield was a breed of war pony from the North that was favored among the regions shield dwarves.\nThese ponies were quite large and possessed a dense musculature. They were exceptional at traversing mountainous terrain, and were strong enough to support the weight of a dwarf in full plate armor. They had thick and shaggy winter coats, which they shed in the hotter months, revealing a rough brown hide.\nWhiteshield ponies earned their name from the shield-shaped patch of white hair that was found on the forehead of pure-breed specimens. Dwarven riders often tattooed or painted their personal heraldry upon this spot, distinguishing their mount from others.\nWhile these ponies were common within the dwarf holds of the North they were rarely made available to non-dwarves. If they were sold to outsiders, they fetched a hefty price of around 1000 gp."
