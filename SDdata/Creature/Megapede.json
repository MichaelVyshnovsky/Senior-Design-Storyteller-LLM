        "mainbody": "'''Megapedes''' were gigantic, [[centipede]]-like creatures that could be found in deserts and other sandy environments.",
        "Description": "They had extremely long, segmented bodies that were covered in coarse, bristly hairs. Hundreds of pairs of legs extended from either sides of the body.\n\nThe head of each megapede features enormous, powerful mandibles.",
        "Abilities": "Megapedes possessed [[tremorsense]], which allowed them to detect anything else underground within a range of {{SI|120|ft}}.",
        "Combat": "A megapede buried itself beneath the surface of sand, or within rocky caverns, waiting to strike out against any unawares creature that would become its next meal.\n\nWhile the [[poison]]ous bite of a megapede could be quite lethal, its most potent weapon was the ''psychic bomb'' it employed. Each megapade exuded an aura of [[necrotic energy]] that drained the life of nearby creatures, and made them susceptible to a unique psychic attack that would incapacitate them.",
        "History": "The [[mercane]] [[Vocath]] was known to employ a megapede named [[Queen Gorma]] in the arena of his personal domain in [[wildspace]]."
