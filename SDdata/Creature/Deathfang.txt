Deathfangs were a type of undead created from the body of a flying snake.
These creatures measured the same length as a flying snake, around , but they had body wings that could not move as much air.
Deathfangs lacked the acidic spittle of their living counterparts. Much like any undead they had an immunity to cold-based spells or abilities, as well as charm, hold, sleep, and death magic spells. Additionally, once they had their fangs sunk into an enemy a death fang could drain a foe of their positive energy.
They could only be mentally controlled or influenced by the one who created them. 
Deathfangs fought in a similar manner to living flying snakes.
In 1358 DR,This is derived from the date given in Cloak & Dagger for the death of Flaern Cragsmere, mentioned in the Undermountain Adventures booklet in this boxed set. deathfangs could be found in some of the monster filled pit traps of Undermountain.
There were a few different ways that a flying snake could be turned into a deathfang. One way, though rare, was by being killed by a vampire or greater undead. Another means was by evil priests and wizards with specialized knowledge, using spells such as create undead.
