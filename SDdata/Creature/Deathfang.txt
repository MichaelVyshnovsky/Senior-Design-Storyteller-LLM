'''Deathfangs''' were a type of [[undead]] created from the body of a [[flying snake]].

==Description==
These creatures measured the same length as a flying snake, around {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}}, but they had body wings that could not move as much air.

==Abilities==
Deathfangs lacked the [[acid]]ic spittle of their living counterparts. Much like any undead they had an immunity to cold-based [[spell]]s or abilities, as well as ''[[charm]]'', ''hold'', ''[[sleep]]'', and [[death magic]] spells. Additionally, once they had their fangs sunk into an enemy a death fang could drain a foe of their [[positive energy]].

They could only be mentally controlled or influenced by the one who created them. 

==Combat==
Deathfangs fought in a similar manner to living flying snakes.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]],<ref group="note">This is derived from the date given in ''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'' for the death of [[Flaern Cragsmere]], mentioned in the ''Undermountain Adventures'' booklet in this boxed set. deathfangs could be found in some of the monster filled pit traps of [[Undermountain]].<ref>

==Ecology==
===Creation===
There were a few different ways that a flying snake could be turned into a deathfang. One way, though rare, was by being killed by a [[vampire]] or greater undead. Another means was by [[evil]] [[priest]]s and [[wizard]]s with specialized knowledge, using [[spell]]s such as ''[[create undead]]''.
===Habitats===
The use of death fangs in the Realms was largely limited to [[Calimshan]] and other areas in [[Faerûn]] that were south of the continent's [[Northwest Faerûn|northwest region]]. 
===Relationships===
Some evil-aligned [[necromancer]]s took on deathfangs as [[familiar]]s. And the serpent god [[Sseth]] was known to use them as [[favored monster|servants]], working through them.<ref>
