'''Baluchitheria''' ({{Pronounce|ba|loo|ki|THEER|ee|um|refs = {{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) were an ancient type of [[rhinoceros]].

==Description==
Baluchiteria were very large creatures, with adult specimens capable of reaching a height of up to {{SI|18|ft|long=yes}} and a length of {{SI|28|ft|long=yes}}. They were extremely heavy, with some individuals weighing up to {{SI|30000|lbs.|k|long=yes}}. They had excellent senses of smell and hearing, but suffered from poor eyesight.

==Behavior==
Although normally solitary in nature, mated pairs of baluchiteria stayed together. If three were spotted together, they were most likely a mated pair plus a calf.

It was possible to tame baluchiteria, provided one raised them from a calf or used [[magic]] to control them. They made excellent beasts of burden, capable of carrying up to {{SI|8000|lbs.|k|long=yes}}.

==Combat==
Highly defensive creatures, baluchiteria had a tendency to attack other beings that strayed too close. They tended to trample their opponents, or otherwise attack using their heavy front hooves.

==Ecology==
Baluchiteria were herbivores, and were mostly found on plains.

In the Realms, baluchiteria were known to live in the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

Beyond [[Toril]], they could be found on the planet of [[Krynn]].
===Usages===
The [[Pterafolk]] of the Chultan Peninsula considered their flesh to be a delicacy.

==History==
In the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], one could occasionally encounter caravans featuring baluchitheria in the city of [[Waterdeep]].<ref>

==Trivia==
A baluchitherium could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' [[spell]].<ref>
