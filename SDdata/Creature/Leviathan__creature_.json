Their stomachs also tended to accumulate the undigestable belongings of creatures and ships.\nGenerally had a neutral disposition towards humanoids, but their alignment was generally more lawful good when it came to ocean life.\nLeviathans fought in the same manner as other whales, though their unimaginable proportions made them far greater threats. They were also capable of creating massive waves by breaching the surface of the ocean and halfway leaping out. Once a ship was sank it would circle back to swallow anything it could.\nUnlike all other species of whale, leviathans did not live in pods, but rather lived solitary lives due to their immense size, with legends claiming that only one could be found within any given ocean on a world. Wherever they went other predatory creatures were more than likely to follow, hoping to capitalize on the sinks they sunk, including barracudas, ixitxachitl, sharks, various types of giant fish, and even sahuagins. They could be active at any time of day, but could hibernate for periods of years. They would always awaken upon calls of help from other whales or requests from the gods.\nThe leviathans on a world only gathered once every century to engage in talk and mating, meeting within arctic waters. These gatherings lasted for around six months. During these gathering each leviathan was attended by a company of around two to twenty giant whales and ten to as many as a hundred common whales.\nLeviathans were an omnivorous species, known for preying upon ships.\nOne or more of these creatures could potentially be found in the Inner SeaThe original text featured a disclaimer stating, \"Note that having a ship capable of being towed by a creature is no guarantee that the creature is available,\" meaning there is no guarantee that a leviathan inhabited the Sea of Fallen Stars. and the Crowded Sea. One by the name of Hamnuatha lived in the Trackless Sea, in the harbor of Leuthilspar, acting as a patrolling sentinel for the capital of Evermeet. In Wildspace, one to three leviathans could be found traveling as part of the entourage of Great Dreamers within massive spherical envelopes of airy water.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, leviathans could be found in the Elemental Plane of Water, with some living around the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls as servants of the noble marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari.\nOn rare occasions a leviathan would answer a summons of aid from avatars of Valkur, a minor Faer√ªnian god of sailors and ships.\nWhile the bodies of whales were generally valued by sailors, those of leviathans were worth far greater sums of coin. Their carcasses could be worth anywhere from around 3,600 to 7,200 gold pieces and any ambergris extracted from their stomachs was worth around 4,000 to 80,000 gold pieces.\n* Practitioners of Elven High Magic were capable of summoning a leviathan to their aid with a spell that was named for the creature."
