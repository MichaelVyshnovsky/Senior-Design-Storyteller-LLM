'''Gorse''' were tiny [[Fey|faeries]] that lived in their namesake plant.

==Description==
Gorse faeries were only {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} tall, similar in proportion and appearance to a human child, but possessing pointed ears and butterfly-like wings. They typically wore simple clothing that was green or yellow in color.

==Abilities==
Gorse, like other fey, could naturally cast a few spells. Once a day, a gorse could cast ''[[exterminate]]'', ''[[sprout]]'', ''[[distract]]'', and ''[[mirror image]]''. One in ten gorse could also cast ''[[goodberry]]'' and ''[[spike growth]]'' once per day.

==Personality==
Gorse were shy and unobtrusive fey.

==Combat==
Gorse fought to protect themselves and their homes, using minute bows, spears, and swords. About 10% of their arrows were coated with a [[poison]] that caused mild confusion.

Gorse typically used the spell ''exterminate'' to deal with enemies that, while mere pests to larger creatures, were threats to the tiny faeries.

==Society==
These faeries lived in tribes that laired in patches of gorse bushes: these thorny plants made the lairs rather forbidding to larger creatures, as the thorns were dangerous and the branches dense enough to impede movement. Gorse bushes were evergreens that bloomed with yellow flowers, hence why the faeries dressed in those colors.

Gorse faeries would sometimes have magical potions in their tribe's treasure trove. Due to their small size, some potions that would be only a single dose for a larger creature would be twenty doses for them. Others, however, that required drinking the entire potion for the effect would be untouched and possibly traded for a more useful one.
===Diet===
Gorse were a herbivorous species of fey.
===Languages===
Gorse had their own language, and were also able to speak the languages of [[sprite]]s and [[pixie]]s.
===Relationships===
Gorse were wary of "big folk", but were protective of those who did them favors, such as [[druid]]s or [[elves]] who defeated menacing beasts or fought wildfires. If such as ally was nearby, it was not unusual for a tribe to send a few members to accompany them for the duration of their visit. They could also be persuaded to deal with forest-dwellers that brought gifts of bread, fresh fruit, or milk.

Gorse were a [[favored monster]] of the [[Seldarine]] [[deities]] [[Aerdrie Faenya]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], and [[Hanali Celanil]].

==Trivia==
* A gorse was one of the forms that a caster of the spell ''[[faerie form]]'' could assume.
