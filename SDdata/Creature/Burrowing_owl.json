        "Description": "These owls possessed golden feathers and talons twice the size of normal owls.",
        "Behavior": "Burrowing owls typically lived near patches of [[ab'i]] tubers. The owls would use their large talons to burrow several feet into the ground to avoid the daytime heat. They could be found in groups of 2&ndash;8 individuals.  Travelers attempting to harvest the ab'i who disturbed the owls were attacked aggressively."
