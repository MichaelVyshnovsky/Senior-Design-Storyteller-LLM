        "mainbody": "Burrowing owls were a species of owl that inhabited the High Desert of Zakhara, on the plains north of the Range of the Marching Camels.\nThese owls possessed golden feathers and talons twice the size of normal owls.\nBurrowing owls typically lived near patches of abi tubers. The owls would use their large talons to burrow several feet into the ground to avoid the daytime heat. They could be found in groups of 2&ndash8 individuals.  Travelers attempting to harvest the abi who disturbed the owls were attacked aggressively."
