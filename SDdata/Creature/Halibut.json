        "Description": "Halibut was a species of brown-colored on top and white bottom flatfish that could reach relatively massive size. This fish was popular for its fresh taste and solid texture, especially palatable when grilled.",
        "Ecology": "Halibut could be found inhabiting the [[Sea of Swords]] near the [[Baldur's Gate]], feeding the city's fishers. Halibut was also found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]: the eastern nation of [[Aglarond]] and [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]], where halibut was sold at the [[Shark Fin]] eatery for a single [[silver]] [[coin|piece]].\n\nBeyond Faerûn, halibut inhabited cold oceans of Kara-Tur.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Pilos Lafrett]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] invented a device that used balanced weights that would allow the fisher to do the fishing on its own, while Pilos could nap. His boss [[Tohil]] was informed of the invention and that it would be producing labor-free halibut."
