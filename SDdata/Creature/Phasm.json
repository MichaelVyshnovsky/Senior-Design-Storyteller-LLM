        "mainbody": "Phasms were amorphous shapechangers.\nIn their true form, phasms resembled amorphous, colorful oozes about  in diameter and  tall, and weighed about . However, they were natural shapechangers that could take the form of almost any creature or object.\nPhasms were chaotic and unreliable, more interested in enjoying themselves and having new experiences than anything else, as their shapechanging ability freed them from most material needs, letting live lives of exploration, hedonism, or contemplation as they wished.\nBesides their shapechanging ability, phasms had tremorsense as long as they were touching the ground, and they could speak telepathically.\nFaced with danger, a phasm was equally likely to attack, retreat, or parley, according to their whims. Opponents who offered some new experience, though, had a good chance of avoiding a fight. When combat broke out, however, a phasm would transform into the most fearsome creature they could.\nPhasms did not live near each other, but were known to live among other peoples. They were natural but unreliable spies, since they often didnt feel the need to report in however, they had an affinity for doppelgangers and would ally with them for security or fun.\nAs of 1372 DR, there were phasm members of the Unseen.\n* Chiirikk, a phasm posing as a drow sorcerer."
