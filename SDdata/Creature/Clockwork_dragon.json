        "Description": "They resembled finely crafted statues plated in the metals that corresponded to the varieties of [[metallic dragon]]s, including [[brass dragon|brass]], [[bronze dragon|bronze]], [[copper dragon|copper]], [[silver dragon|silver]], or [[gold dragon|faux gold]].\n\nTheir size often varied, ranging from about the size of any [[humanoid]] to that of any actual [[dragon aging|adult dragon]].",
        "Abilities": "These draconic creations were exceptionally intelligent and made for superb guardians. They could be \"programed\" to take a series of intricate actions depending on the circumstances surrounding any potential encounter.\n\nLike other constructs, clockwork dragons had no need to breathe, sleep, or eat for sustenance. They were however vulnerable to any forms of [[magic]] or other powers that affected true, living breathing dragons.{{Cite adventurers league/Against the Machine|19}}",
        "Combat": "Clockwork dragons fought in a similar manner to their organic inspirators. They could bite or claw opponents and use their enormous wings to knock others down with their mere presence.\n\nThey also possessed dragons' breath weapons, though theirs came in two varieties. Clockwork dragons could breathe lightning—in a manner similar to [[blue dragon]]s―or \"repulsion energy\", which sent their enemies flying back upwards of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nWhile in their preferred lair, clockwork dragons could [[fog cloud|create an obfuscating cloud of fog]] or [[thunderclap|blasts of sound]] that resembled the clap of thunder.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1496}}, several [[humanoid]]-sized clockwork dragons were stationed outside the [[Orrery Vault]] as guardians.",
