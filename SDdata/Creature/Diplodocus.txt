'''Diplodocuses''' were a species of massive semi-quatic herbivorous [[dinosaur]] that lived near swamps, part of the sauropod family, which, in turn, was a part of the larger saurischian family. They were, perhaps, the longest among all species of dinosaurs, but, due to the thinness of the neck and tail, not the heaviest.

==Description==
Diplodocuses were colossal dinosaurs with long necks and long tails that walked on four legs. They were nearly {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} long, measured from the top of their heads to the whip-like tail's end, and weighed over 20 tons. Their snake-like necks were topped with small heads relative to their wide, mammoth bodies. The back of their necks had a row of short spines that ran all alongside their bodies full length.

==Behavior==
Diplodocuses were slowly moving creatures that constantly fed to sustain their massive bodies. They typically were non-violent beasts who retaliated swiftly against a perceived threat.

==Combat==
When battling smaller opponents, diplodocuses attacked with their tails, sweeping and retreating, trampling opponents in the process. When dealing with predators larger than them, they slammed their tails at the enemy and relied on their greater numbers for protection.

==Ecology==
Diplodocuses were herd animals and could often be encountered as solitary creatures, pairs, or groups of six to eighteen beasts, as the herd offered protection from predators. They inhabited plains, [[fern]] prairies, edges of temperate forests lakes, and swamps. They were herbivorous and fed on the leaves of tall [[tree]]s, aided by their long necks, as well as submerging their necks for aquatic plants.

===Habitats===
Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], some could be found in the [[Forbidden Plateau (divine realm)|Forbidden Plateau]].
