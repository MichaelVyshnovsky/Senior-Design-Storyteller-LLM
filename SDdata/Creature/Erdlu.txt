'''Erdlus''' were a hardy species of flightless, reptilian-esque [[bird]]s found only on the desert world of [[Athas]] and were among its most common domesticated animals.

==Description==
The average adult erdlu stood {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SI|200|lb|k}}. Despite being birds, erdlus lacked feathers, instead exhibiting scales on their large, round bodies. The non-functional wings that folded at the sides of their bodies exhibited harder, armored plate-like scales. Erdlu scales ranged from a flaky or pale gray to deep red in coloration, though the ones on their long, [[snake]]-like necks, were yellow.

Erdlus had small, round heads with large wedge-shaped beaks that were quite sharp, able to pierce creatures like a [[spear]]head. Their legs were lanky, yet powerful, ending in four-toed feet that were tipped with razor-sharp claws. They could sprint at great speeds over distances of several hundred yards, but generally no more than {{SI|0.5|mi|long=yes}} or {{SI|880|yd|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
Erdlus exhibited an animal level of intellect and a temperament considered ideal for a herd animal. When threatened they preferred to flee, rather than fight, relying upon their great speed and dispersion tactics to outmaneuver predators.

==Combat==
When fleeing seemed impossible an erdlu flock would fight together as a group, while a cornered erdlu would fight to making an opening for them to escape. They always struck at opponents with their sharp beaks first, followed by raking them with their claws.

==History==
In The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[portal|gate]]'' to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers. A young thri-kreen named [[Ka'cha]] was among creatures captured by the elves, and he lamented being separated from his clutch.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|9}} Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|13}}

After two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large erdlu eggs and two ''[[potion fruit|apples of healing]]''. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination—the [[Ringing Forest]]—the way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|14}}

==Ecology==
Erdlus instinctively congregated and traveled in large flocks for protection.

Their eggs had a wrinkled, leathery appearance and red yolks.
===Diet===
These creatures had a Omnivorous diet, allowing them to survive in most habitats on Athas. In terms of plant life, their hardy beaks allowed erdlus to eat many tough vegetation and to work through thorns to forage at roots. They also fed upon various reptiles, [[snake]]s, and insects.
===Relationships===
A variety of different cultures across Athas raised erdlus, with most nomadic herdsmen relying upon them for their livelihoods.

Outside of being herded, wild erdlus were hunted by [[Athasian thri-kreen]].<ref>
===Usages===
Erdlus were raised for a variety of purposes, chief among them their edible eggs. as they were packed with a variety of nutrients and essential vitamins. If cooked, the egg whites would form a spongy cake that had a rich taste, reminiscent of sharp [[cheese]]. But if consumed raw, an act which was customary among nomadic herdsmen tribes on the move, an erdlu egg could act as a substitute for {{SI|1|gallon}} of water. Such substitution was only ever successful a period of one week. This raw taste was said to be both gamey and zesty.

Erdlus were also prized for their meat, though nomadic herdsmen only resorted to this when an erdlu was too old or infirm to travel. Beyond food, parts of erdlu bodies were harvested for a variety of purposes. Their claws could be made into [[dagger]]s or other tools, while their beaks could be fashioned into proper spearheads. The tendons of their long necks could be fashioned into [[bowstring]]s. And the scales on their wings could be fashioned into either light armor or [[shield]]s.
