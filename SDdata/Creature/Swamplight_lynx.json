Their coloring (usually a shade of yellow) allowed them to camouflage themselves in their surroundings.\nSwamplight lynxes particularly liked the taste of elven flesh.\nSwamplight lynxes had several magical abilities, including light and faerie fire, which they used to confuse and distract their targets.\nSwamplight lynxes dwelt in swamps and marshes."
