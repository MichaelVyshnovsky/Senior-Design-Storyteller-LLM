A '''glamer''' was an incorporeal entity whose existence was attributed to the death of the [[deity]] [[Leira]]. It was inherently adept at casting [[illusion]] magic and in fact enveloped itself in an illusory appearance.{{Cite dragon/299/The Dragon's Bestiary}}

==Description==
The exact appearance of a glamer was unknown to all as their kind preferred to obscure themselves in illusions. Some said they resembled [[will-o'-wisp]]s that were enveloped in a thick fog.

==Personality==
A glamer was a capricious being that was just as likely to help an individual as it was to be mocking or cruel. It would just as easily play a game with an individual as it would deceive them into carrying out some plot for its own amusement.

It was not one to place its faith in others and often spoke in a cryptic and befuddling manner.

==Abilities==
Due to its nature and origin, a glamer had a myriad of divinatory and illusory [[spell]]-like abilities at its disposal. At all times, it could [[detect magic|sense magical effects]], [[read magic|comprehend arcane texts]], and [[Rary's telepathic bond|form telepathic bonds]] with others. It was able to [[change self|change its appearance]] at will and form a variety of illusions a number of times each day.

==Society==
Glamers were almost wholly solitary entities.

==History==
The glamers were believed to have been formed in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, when the avatar of [[Leira]] was slain by the mortal [[Cyric]]. Her divine essence was released from her body and motes of its power traveled to her temples across [[Faer√ªn]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a number of glamers used a [[Hallucinatory terrain|spell]] to completely shroud the [[Whamite Isles]] to all, except for [[Borran Klosk]] of [[Turmish]]. While some faithful [[Church of Leira|Leirans]] believed this event heralded their goddess' return, others thought it was part of a scheme to exact revenge on Cyric.
