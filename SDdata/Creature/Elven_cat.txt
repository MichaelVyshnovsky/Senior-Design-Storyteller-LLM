An elven cat or elfin cat was a feline from a race bred by elves, infused with magic through generations of close contact with their sorcery.
Most elven cats had dark-striped fur of gray brown. They were sometimes mistaken for lynxes or wild cats.
Elven cats were very intelligent, with many of them conversant in rudimentary elven language alongside their own. Some had instead attached themselves to families of halflings or gnomes and spoke these languages instead, or even the tongue of brownies or other sylvan languages.
