'''Humanoid''' was a general term for the enormous variety of sentient species that made up the world's primary inhabitants, both savage and civilized. They were capable of language, culture, and in many cases of learning [[magic]].

==Description==
Humanoids were typically bipedal, having two arms, two legs, and walking upright.<ref> But they varied widely in terms of size and features. and they were generally capable of using tools and weapons.

==Sub-Families==
;[[Demihuman]]s: This was the term used to collectively refer to [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s.<ref><ref> What some humans viewed as being the "civilized",<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/Non-human Claimants to the Dragon Throne}} generally benevolent, non-humans.<ref> The term "demihuman" was rooted in a human-centric perspective, as some [[human]]s considered themselves to be wholly distinct from other humanoids, some even going so far as to claim that humans predated most humanoid races.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/83/The Everwinking Eye: Something Is Rotten At The Citadel Of The Raven|29}} A few of the [[Nubari]] tribes of the [[Malatran Plateau]] considered anything not human to be an animal and thus allowable to be hunted down and eaten.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|8}}
;[[Goblinoid]]s: Otherwise known as "goblinkin," "goblinoid" was a term used to collectively refer to [[goblin]]s and the humanoid races believed to be related to them, such as [[hobgoblin]]s and [[orc]]s.{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|94}}
;Humanoids: The term humanoids was also frequently used in a narrower sense, which excluded humans as well as demihumans and giants.<ref><ref>

==Society==
The most numerous humanoid societies were those of the dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. 

A few other humanoid races were far more primitive and generally [[evil]]

Sometimes these humanoids would go against the norms of their societies and take up the life of an [[adventurer]]. They often faced prejudice along the way, with inns having rules against serving them, shops refusing to do business with them, authorities watching them closely for signs of trouble, They could also require weapons specially designed for someone of their size.
