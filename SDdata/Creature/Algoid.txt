Algoids () were colonial forms of algae that took a humanoid shape.
The humanoid shapes that algoids took were noted as having coarse and rough features.
These creatures possessed only a rudimentary form of intelligence.
Algoids had the ability to animate certain especially hydrophilic trees, including cypresses, water-oaks, and willows. This ability was similar to that of a treant and they could control up to two trees in this manner. In addition, once per day they could unleash a mind blast.
Algoids were immune to most forms of psionic attack, as well as the effects of fireball. They were particularly vulnerable to the spells lower water and part water. Edged weaponry would pass right through their bodies unless they had an enchantment of +2 or greater.
Besides their mind blast and ability to control hydrophilic trees, algoids fought their opponents by beating them with the fists of their humanoid forms.
Ranging as far back as the days of Netheril, Moanderites strove to spread algoids throughout Toril, and the creatures sometimes directly served the Darkbringer themselves.
In the , the Mouth of Moander, Mogion, controlled a pair of fiercely loyal algoids using a ring of plant control.
Being plants, algoids employed photosynthesis to generate energy, and a lack of natural light could "starve" one in mere days. An algoid suffering from light deprivation gradually turned entirely black as they died.
These creatures were typically found near swamps or lakeside pastures.
The light-starved black corpses of algoids were valued by priests and alchemists for the manufacture of salves and reducing gold ore.
