'''Algoids''' ({{Pronounce|Ã†L|goyd|refs = {{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}}}) were colonial forms of algae that took a humanoid shape.

==Description==
The humanoid shapes that algoids took were noted as having coarse and rough features.

==Behavior==
These creatures possessed only a rudimentary form of intelligence.

==Abilities==
Algoids had the ability to animate certain especially hydrophilic trees, including [[cypress]]es, [[oak|water-oak]]s, and [[willow]]s. This ability was similar to that of a [[treant]] and they could control up to two trees in this manner. In addition, once per day they could unleash a ''[[mind blast]]''.

Algoids were immune to most forms of [[psionic]] attack, as well as the effects of ''[[fireball]]''. They were particularly vulnerable to the [[spell]]s ''[[lower water]]'' and ''[[part water]]''. Edged weaponry would pass right through their bodies unless they had an [[item enchantment|enchantment of +2 or greater]].

==Combat==
Besides their ''mind blast'' and ability to control hydrophilic trees, algoids fought their opponents by beating them with the fists of their humanoid forms.

==History==
Ranging as far back as the days of [[Netheril]], [[Moander]]ites strove to spread algoids throughout [[Toril]], and the creatures sometimes directly served the Darkbringer themselves.

In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the Mouth of Moander, [[Mogion]], controlled a pair of fiercely loyal algoids using a ''[[ring of plant control]]''.

==Ecology==
Being plants, algoids employed photosynthesis to generate energy, and a lack of natural light could "starve" one in mere days. An algoid suffering from light deprivation gradually turned entirely black as they died.
===Habitats===
These creatures were typically found near swamps or lakeside pastures.

===Usages===
The light-starved black corpses of algoids were valued by [[priest]]s and [[alchemist]]s for the manufacture of [[salve]]s and reducing [[gold]] ore.
