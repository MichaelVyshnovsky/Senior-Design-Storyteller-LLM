It's a small price to pay for your life.|[[X the Mystic]]'s 2{{nd}} [[Rules of Dungeon Survival|rule of dungeon survival]]}}",
        "Description": "The upper half of a water weird typically appeared like a beautiful, translucent, blue female [[humanoid]] composed entirely of water, but the lower half could appear serpentine or like a column of water rising from the pool.",
        "Personality": "Water weirds were considered very intelligent creatures. They were capable of being either very noble or [[evil]], depending upon the state of the water that they guarded.",
        "Biology": "Water weirds fed off the essence of other creatures, though how was unknown.",
        "Abilities": "Due to their bodies being composed entirely of water, [[fire]]-based [[spell]]s were ineffective against them while cold-based spells would slow their movement. The spell ''[[purify water]]'' was also known to be very deadly towards them.",
        "Combat": "Water weirds generally fought by striking out at their opponents with their serpentine form, paralyzing them. They would then drag the opponent into the water and attempt to drown them.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Water weirds were native to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].\n\nOn the [[Prime Material plane]], water weirds were occasionally found in the seas and ocean around the [[Moonshae Isles]].",
