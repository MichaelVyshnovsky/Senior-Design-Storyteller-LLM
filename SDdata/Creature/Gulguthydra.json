        "Behavior": "Devouring everything in their paths, these aberrations left no treasure.",
        "Combat": "These creatures charged directly at whatever prey or enemy was in front of them, and struck out at anything nearby that was edible with their tentacles and multi-headed bites. As such, gulguthydrae could attack as much as eight other creatures at the same time. Their stench would cause most opponents to become immediately nauseated, being unable to attack or even cast [[spell]]s.\n\nGulguthydrae were naturally well-armored, yet still able to move at moderate speeds (both running and swimming).",
        "History": "It was unknown how exactly these rare hybrids came to be. However, many believed that they spawned during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. During this turbulent era, many surges of [[wild magic]] occurred, especially around the [[Sword Coast]], and were a potential cause.\n\nBeing exceptionally rare, only few accounts of gulguthydrae have been made throughout history. It was known that a couple of these beings lurked in the [[Farsea Marshes]] of [[Cormyr]]. These reports stated that [[beholderkin]] would stay around the huge creatures, feeding on the scraps whilst gulguthydrae were feasting. The gulguthydrae, which warded off other predators, would tolerate the eyeball beholderkin presence, as they would sometimes daze and freeze swift foes with their eye beams. This aided the gulguthydrae to catch almost any prey that fell into their paths.\n\nDuring the [[Rat Hills Conflagration]] of [[1367 DR]], a party of adventurers were killed and towers of garbage were set alight. A gulguthydra was seen inhabiting the area before the crisis. During that same year, they could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath nearby [[Waterdeep]].\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], [[Zasian Menz]], [[Myshik Morueme]], and [[Kaanyr Vhok]] traveled to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. They located the remains of a creature that resembled a fire version of a gulguthydra.",
