        "mainbody": "A living muck was an oozing mass of filth.\nLiving mucks were described to be pudding-like creatures. As such, they were dark, featureless blobs.\nAttacking such a creature with metal weapons would cause the weapons to be destroyed. Thus, usage of ranged magic or wooden weapons was often the best way to deal with them.\nAs with other oozes, they had a large array of resistances and immunities. Living mucks were completely immune to acid, lightning, and poison, as well as resistant to fire. Cold-based magic would usually harm the creatures.\nLiving mucks were known to serve the Dark God, and resided in the Temple of Lathander in Myth Drannor."
