        "Types of Whale": ";Baleen whales\n: The baleen whales were the larger,\n; Toothed whales\n: Toothed whales were active hunters that preyed upon such large creatures as [[giant squid]]s and [[kraken]]s, though often relied upon smaller more accessible food. The known species of toothed whales in the Realms included [[killer whale]]s, [[narwhal]]s, and [[sperm whale]]s. All could be found in the Sea of Fallen Stars, with the killer whale being the one most often sighted by sailors and scholars due to their hunting grounds coinciding with some of that sea's more prominent surface trade lanes.\n; [[Giant whale]]s\n: The second largest variety of whale found on [[Toril]]. These creatures resembled sperm whales and devoted themselves to protecting the more common species of whales from sea monsters and whalers.\n; [[Leviathan (creature)|Leviathans]]\n: Also known as \"Lords of all Whales\", these fabled creatures were whales of immeasurable size. They were said to be intermediaries between whales and [[deities]]. Only one was said to exist within an ocean on any given world, if at all.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Society": "Whales were intelligent enough that they had devised their own calendar system, known as [[Whaletime]].<ref>",
            "Habitats": "Whales inhabited [[Patzcoatl]], the Western Ocean of [[Maztica]]. Over height different species of them could be found in the deeper waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars, beyond the northern coasts and the [[Pirate Isles]].",

            "Usages": "The bodies of whales were highly valued by surface dwellers for a variety of purposes. [[Whale oil]] was used as a type of [[lamp oil]] on the western shores of Maztica. that was used for creating various aromatics and [[perfume]]s.\n\nIn Maztica, whales were hunted by the [[Metahel]] tribes that lived along the shores of Patzcoatl."
        },
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], many scholars in the [[Heartlands]] insisted that very few whales existed within the Sea of Fallen Stars due to its relatively small size. Though those who lived within that body of water attested that many could be found within its deeper waters.",
        "Notable Whales": "* [[Leviathan]], one of the Children of the [[Earthmother]].\n* [[Naahal]], the famed whale [[bard]] of [[Ser√¥s]]."
