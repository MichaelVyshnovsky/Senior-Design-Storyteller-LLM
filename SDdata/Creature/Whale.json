The known species of toothed whales in the Realms included killer whales, narwhals, and sperm whales. All could be found in the Sea of Fallen Stars, with the killer whale being the one most often sighted by sailors and scholars due to their hunting grounds coinciding with some of that seas more prominent surface trade lanes.\n Giant whales\n The second largest variety of whale found on Toril. These creatures resembled sperm whales and devoted themselves to protecting the more common species of whales from sea monsters and whalers.\n Leviathans\n Also known as \"Lords of all Whales\", these fabled creatures were whales of immeasurable size. They were said to be intermediaries between whales and deities. Only one was said to exist within an ocean on any given world, if at all.\nWhales were intelligent enough that they had devised their own calendar system, known as Whaletime.\nWhales inhabited Patzcoatl, the Western Ocean of Maztica. Over height different species of them could be found in the deeper waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars, beyond the northern coasts and the Pirate Isles.\nAll whales shared a common language.\nWhales were sacred to the elven god Deep Sashelas and the deities Istishia and Valkur.\nThe bodies of whales were highly valued by surface dwellers for a variety of purposes. Whale oil was used as a type of lamp oil on the western shores of Maztica. that was used for creating various aromatics and perfumes.\nIn Maztica, whales were hunted by the Metahel tribes that lived along the shores of Patzcoatl.\nIn the 14 century DR, many scholars in the Heartlands insisted that very few whales existed within the Sea of Fallen Stars due to its relatively small size. Though those who lived within that body of water attested that many could be found within its deeper waters.\n* Leviathan, one of the Children of the Earthmother.\n* Naahal, the famed whale bard of Ser√¥s."
