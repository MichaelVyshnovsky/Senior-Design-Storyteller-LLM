'''Naiads''' were a rarely seen [[fey]] water spirits that lived in [[Sisters|the Sisters]] along with [[nereid]]s, [[sylph]]s, [[pixie]]s, and [[leprechaun]]s.

{{quote|Elf?.. No, this voice was sweeter, purer even than any that issued from the throats of the [[Fair Folk]]. A [[nymph]] or naiad? She would have fled from the monstrously [[vampire|unnatural thing]] he had become...|[[Jander Sunstar]]'s thoughts upon hearing fey singing.}}

==History==
During the days before the [[Weeping War]], naiads lived in the lakes and fountains of [[Myth Drannor]] and served as their protectors.

In [[1370 DR]], naiads were elusive and could be found residing in the streams and waterfalls of [[Unicorn Run]] and the Sisters, along with other fey creatures.

==Notable Naiads==
*[[Plinshree]] - a water spirit that guarded the waterbells of [[Myth Drannor]]'s complex waterway systems that stretched all throughout the City Heights and [[Dwarven Dungeons]].
