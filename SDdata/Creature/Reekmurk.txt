A '''reekmurk''' was a huge and rare [[aquatic ooze]] that usually lurked in deep oceans or underground rivers and lakes.

==Description==
Reekmurks gained their name from their "reek" and their "murky" color. The stench of a reekmurk was said to be unbearable, and creatures even as far as {{SI|30|ft}} away could become nauseated.

These oozes looked like [[ink]] clouds when within water, but more like flat layers of black oil on land. They were quick on both land and water, but were especially quick in the latter.

==Behavior==
These great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies had one major fear: sunlight. Thus, reekmurks were never willingly found out of water during the day. However, they were often driven out of the freezing depths of the ocean by undersea earthquakes.

==Combat==
When in combat, reekmurks changed their form to reach out with many tendrils. Only very dexterous creatures could get away without become [[poison]]ed or taking [[acid]] damage. Their strong acids could dissolve anything organic, particularly [[wood]]. Wooden equipment, such as wood weapons, would ''instantly'' dissolve, unless the users of the weapons had very quick reflexes.

Reekmurks were immune to [[cold]]-based attacks, but were incredibly vulnerable to sunlight. Just being exposed to sunlight would severely damage them, and [[spell]]s such as ''[[sunbeam]]'' and ''[[sunburst]]'' were ruinous.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these aquatic oozes were known to guard the caverns of [[Umberlee's Cache]] in [[Waterdeep]].
