        "mainbody": "A dragonfish was a small spiked fish living in the waterways of Chult\nA dragonfish was a 2-foot-long (60 centimeters) flatfish with a mottled brown coloration and a fringe of poisonous spikes that would break off into any victim that either stepped on or touched the back of the dragonfish. So strong were the spikes that even normal hardened leather would be penetrated by them. A slow-acting but very deadly toxin would be released into the hapless victim. The coloration of the dragonfish made it extremely hard to spot as they blended into the bottom of the streams and waterways in which they lived. \nLiving in waterways, a dragonfish kept itself down on the bottom, hugging and even burrowing into the top silt of the rivers and shallow freshwater pools. They thrived by being hidden from most creatures of the jungle and even those who actively sought out the dragonfish would have a very hard time locating them."
