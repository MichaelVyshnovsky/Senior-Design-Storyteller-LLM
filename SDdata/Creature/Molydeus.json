        "mainbody": "A '''molydeus''' ({{Pronounce|mol|EE|dee|us|refs=}}) ({{Plural|molydei|refs= Feared even more than the [[balor]]s, they served both as intermediaries and enforcers for their respective [[demon lord]]s.",
        "Description": "Molydei were enormous [[humanoid]] creatures that stood {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|1500|lb|k|long=yes}}. Their muscular bodies were covered in crimson red skin and equipped with a set of clawed hands. Their main head resembled a slavering, silver-eyed [[wolf]] or [[hyena]], while a writhing serpent protruded out from their neck.\n\nAt nearly all times, molydei carried a special demonic weapon specifically linked to them. Although it was normally a greataxe, its form was often dependent on the demon lord they served, such as manifesting as a [[flail]] for [[Yeenoghu]]. Jagged runes were carved into the weapon and a shimmering ruby laid within the base of the shaft. If a molydeus was slain, its weapon dissolved into a puddle of ichor.",
        "Personality": "Due to the nature of their relations to their respective demon lords, they had no room for treachery, and so served their lords faithfully. Even though they enforced their doctrine among high-ranking tanar'ri without bias, those below a certain level were thought to be too lowly to trust, and were kept in line with constant threats.",
        "Abilities": "Due to their two heads and truesight, it was nearly impossible to get the jump on a molydeus. Their various resistances made them hard to bring down physically, while possessing two heads increased their resistance to magical manipulation. A slew of spells were at their disposal, making them difficult to deal with, even disregarding their potent physical abilities. Most dangerous of these spells was possibly their power to cast ''[[imprisonment]]'', using the ruby of their weapons as the component. The tanar'ri they summoned were often a small group of [[babau]]s or [[chasme]]s, or a [[marilith]].\n\nMost dangerous of their powers was the venomous bite of their serpentine head. When their dripping fangs injected venom into a creature, even demons who were normally immune to poison, they would undergo a terrifying transformation into a [[mane]]. This transformation was so shockingly permanent that only some form of divine intervention or a carefully worded ''[[wish]]'' spell could undo it.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Molydeus_fighting.png|thumb|right|250px|A molydeus slashes its axe in a pool of carnage.]]\nThe heads of a molydeus took turns biting a foe in combat, while at the same time the demon attacked with its [[greataxe]] and used its potent innate spellcasting abilities. In battle, their myriad of immunities and resistances caused them to fight fearlessly, and they seldom retreated.",
        "Society": {
            "Weapon": "A molydeus was bound to its weapon, and if it was stolen, they would hound the thief incessantly until they could reclaim it. When a molydeus's weapon became irretrievable or destroyed, the only way to acquire a replacement was to make a journey to the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layers 301–400|400{{th}} layer of the Abyss]] and have one forged. This was done through an eight-hour ritual in which manes were used as the raw materials, and the process caused the old weapon to melt away."
        },
        "Creation": "Demons that performed acts of particular ferocity, showed devious cunning, or displayed acts of surprisingly genuine devotion could earn the favor of a demon lord. In these cases, these demons might be rewarded through an excruciatingly painful tormenting process in order to be molded into a molydeus. There was approximately one molydeus on every layer of the Abyss, and it was rare for them to encounter one another.",
        "History": "Some origin stories maintained that, when [[Tharizdun]] discovered the shard of utter evil and buried it in the [[Elemental Chaos]], he charged seven [[angels]] with the protection of his treasure. The [[celestial]] beings were naturally obedient to his wishes, but were unsure if they were doing what they should be in listening to the scheming deity, leaving them frustrated and irresolute.\n\nProximity to the shard caused their forms to violently wrench apart, turning them into the first of the molydei. While the snarling canine head symbolized their rage and fighting ability, the hissing serpent represented their mistrust of their masters and uncertainties about their given task. The axes normally wielded by molydei were sometimes described as tools containing the raw light of creation from their previous existence as angels.",
