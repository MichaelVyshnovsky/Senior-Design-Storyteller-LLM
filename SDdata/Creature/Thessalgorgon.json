        "Description": "A thessalgorgon had a large, reptilian body covered in strong scales. It had a long tail that ended in a pair of large, sharp pincers. Its head was that of a bull, surrounded by a ring of eight [[hydra]]-like heads. The upper half of its body was covered in hair.",
        "Abilities": "Thessalgorgons had a natural immunity to all known acids, as well as petrification effects and spells. It had a devastating breath weapon: a cloud of petrifying gas up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in length. If one of its heads was severed, it grew back over a twelve-day period.",
        "Combat": "Each of the serpentine heads acted independently and injected a poison with each bite.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Some thessalgorgons were known to be found in the land of [[Chult]].",
            "Usage": "Juvenile thessalgorgons were sometimes used as guards. Thessalgorgon eggs were worth up to 7,000 [[gp]] and a live juvenile up to 10,000 gp."
