Dire corbies were a mutated semi-humanoid horrors that were once birds. 
Dire corbies were bipedal humanoids with a black-skinned body, but had a black-feathered, bird-like head and extremely hard, sharp talons on their hands. Additionally, their feet were three-toed and bird-like.
Dire corbies were ferocious fighters that could not be scared or dissuaded during combat, instead always fighting to the death.
Dire corbies possessed darkvision and were capable climbers. They had excellent hearing, but were vulnerable to damage from loud sounds.
Additionally, the cacophonous "song" produced by dire corbies could muddle the minds of any creatures within , slowing them down and rendering them incapable of casting any spells more complicated than a cantrip. The disorientation it induced could leave creatures unable to climb or run due to vertigo.
Dire corbies attacked by using their talons.

Dire corbies lived and hunted in flocks in the Underdark. They were most commonly found in the southern reaches thereof, but they were also known to be living in one of the vaults of Gauntlgrym around . These flocks could be quite large, up to several hundred strong, and followed predictable paths of migration. The areas a flock visited were stripped of all food and cleared of any hostile creatures.
Dire corbies primarily ate lichen, fungus, and small vermin.
They possessed a rudimentary language of their own, consisting of hooting, chirping, and howling the most notable word of which was their battle-cry of "Doom!", although they also made horrible shrieking noises while hunting. They were also known to speak Undercommon.
In the Underdark, maps that showed their migration paths were prized because traveling a day or so behind almost guaranteed that one would not encounter any dangerous creatures. A few brave- or insane- explorers managed to join dire corby flocks by blocking their ears and mimicking their noises.
Dire corbies were known to change their migration route only when the way became impassible or the flock suffered heavy losses in a particular area. When exploration of a new route led to the surface, they would strip the surrounding area of all life.

Dire corbies were once able to fly, but they lost that ability long ago in exchange for their strength and ferocity.
At some point in their history, dire corbies engaged in a centuries-long war with giant bats and were nearly driven to extinction because of it. Afterwards, the two races had an uneasy truce.
Drizzt and Belwar Dissengulp fought dire corbies while wandering the Underdark together.
