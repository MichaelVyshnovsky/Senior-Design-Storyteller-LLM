Dire corbies were a mutated semi-humanoid horrors that were once birds. 
Dire corbies were bipedal humanoids with a black-skinned body, but had a black-feathered, bird-like head and extremely hard, sharp talons on their hands. Additionally, their feet were three-toed and bird-like.
Dire corbies were ferocious fighters that could not be scared or dissuaded during combat, instead always fighting to the death.
Dire corbies possessed darkvision and were capable climbers. They had excellent hearing, but were vulnerable to damage from loud sounds.
Additionally, the cacophonous "song" produced by dire corbies could muddle the minds of any creatures within , slowing them down and rendering them incapable of casting any spells more complicated than a cantrip. The disorientation it induced could leave creatures unable to climb or run due to vertigo.
Dire corbies attacked by using their talons.

Dire corbies were once able to fly, but they lost that ability long ago in exchange for their strength and ferocity.
At some point in their history, dire corbies engaged in a centuries-long war with giant bats and were nearly driven to extinction because of it. Afterwards, the two races had an uneasy truce.
Drizzt and Belwar Dissengulp fought dire corbies while wandering the Underdark together.
