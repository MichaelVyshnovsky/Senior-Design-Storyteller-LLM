        "mainbody": "The '''ixzan''' were a semi-amphibious race, closely related to the [[ixitxachitl]]. They were also called '''demonrays'''.",
        "Habitats": "Like ixitxachitl, they resembled [[manta ray]]s, but unlike their cousins they lived only in the [[Underdark]]. It was a strange fact that, even though there existed saltwater lakes in the Underdark and freshwater lakes on the surface, ixitxachitl were never to be found underground and ixzan were never to be found on the surface.",
        "History": "The true history of the ixzan was lost in the mists of time. About their origin, there were three main theories. The most common told that the ixzan were simply a subterranean offshoot of the ixitxachitl, similar to the kinship of [[drow]] and [[duergar]] to [[elves]] and [[dwarves]], respectively. The second told the opposite, that there was an ancestral race in the Underdark long ago from which derived ixzan, ixitxachitl, [[cloaker]]s, [[lurker]]s, [[mantari]], miners ([[forest trapper]]s), and possibly even [[sinister]]s (which many considered a kind of [[bat]]). After ixitxachitl and miners migrated out of Underdark, all the other races, including ixzan, remained in the same terrain. A third hypothesis, preferred by a few sages, told that ixitchatchitl originated from the surface seas, and for an unknown reason some migrated down into the Underdark. Here, affected by Underdark radiation, emerged the ixzan.\n\nIxzan history after their origin was also nebulous, thanks to their oral transmission of history and the influence of the [[Ilxendren]] clergy. Two events however were considered semi-historical by most: the [[Great Flood]] and the [[Revelation of the Demonray]]. The first told that the scattering of the ixzan race happened as a result of a great flood; sages that believed this story tried to explain the flood as being caused by rapid melting of a glacier, the opening of ''[[gate]]s'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], or the sudden draining of a great lake. The second story told of the apparition of the god Ilxendren, who unified all ixzan under his worship. Previously, ixzan had worshiped many dark powers, usually [[Dagon]], [[Demogorgon]], and even [[Panzuriel]], but afterward virtually all ixzan adopted the worship of Ilxendren. This also caused the birth of the first vampiric ixzan.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "The ixzan had virtually no natural enemies. Their tendency to isolate their community usually allowed them to avoid conflict with humanoid races. The ixzan were on good terms only with [[aboleth]] and [[kuo-toa]]. In relations with aboleth, the aboleth always had the upper hand, with the kuo-toa the ixzan were dominant. Many ixzan lived among kuo-toa."
