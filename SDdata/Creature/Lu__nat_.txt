'''Lu''' were a type of [[Nat (spirit)|nat]] native to [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Lu resembled short and stocky [[humanoid]]s with unkempt hair. They had sharp fangs and claws. They had brilliantly colored blue skin.

==Personality==
Lu were malevolent and had a single purpose: to inflict harm on anyone as much as possible.

==Combat==
In addition to their innate abilities, lu used their sharp teeth and claws as well as basic weapons in combat.

==Abilities==
Lu were powerful creatures and had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[become invisible]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[dancing blade]]'', ''[[deflection]]'', ''[[detect shapechanger]]'', ''[[dream vision]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[passwall]]'', ''[[possess animal]]'', and ''[[quickgrowth]]'' spells at will.

In addition, they had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of [[Apparition (spell)|''apparition'']], ''[[fire shuriken]]'', ''[[melt]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', and ''[[transfix]]'' three times per day, as well as ''[[water to poison]]'' and ''[[wood rot]]'' once per day. 

The area around a lu was constantly shrouded in an invisible cloud of [[disease]]. If a creature encountered this cloud, they were infected with a fatal rotting disease, which defied natural healing abilities or healing spells. Only the strongest creatures were able to survive the infection. Lu were immune to disease and poison and had a resistance to electrical and fire-based spells. Only strong weapons were able to inflict physical damage to a lu.

==Habitat==
Lu were found within cemeteries.

==Ecology==
Their need for inflicting suffering on an individual could be temporarily mitigated if offered a gift of food.
