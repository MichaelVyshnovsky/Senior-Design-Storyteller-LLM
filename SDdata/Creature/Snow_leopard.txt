'''Snow leopards''' were a species of [[leopard]]-like [[cat|big cat]] that inhabited cold climate regions of the Realms.

==History==
Around [[1366 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} when the [[hill giant]] chief [[Noote]] visited [[Castle Hartwick]] he presented the carcass of a snow leopard to King [[Camden]] as a gift to his daughter [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
In [[Faer√ªn]], snow leopards could be found in the [[Ice Spires]].As Chief Noote is the ruler of the hill giants of the Ice Spires, this implies that snow leopards can be found in his territory.

In the [[Hordelands]] snow leopards inhabited the [[Yehimal Mountains]] and its extension the [[A-Ling Shan]], the [[Glacier of the Dragon]] within the Yehimals, the [[Leopard Shan]], the higher reaches of the [[Katakoro Plateau]], and the forest [[Shalhoond]].

In [[Zakhara]], snow leopards inhabited the [[World Pillar Mountains]].{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World|89}}

===Relationships===
Some arctic [[druid]]s were known to have snow leopards as [[animal companion]]s. They were also one of the many types of mountainous animals that some [[oread]]s kept as pets.
===Usages===
The pelt of a snow leopard could be make to make a [[blanket]], [[cloak]], or [[robe]].{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|17}} These pelts typically sold for 8 [[gold piece]]s.

==Trivia==
Several features of the Realms bore the name of the great cat:
*The [[Ghost Leopard]] province of the [[Yikarian Empire]] in [[Northeast Zakhara]].{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World|93}}
*The Leopard Shan or Mountain of the Leopard in the Hordelands.<ref>
*The [[Leopard Stupa]] monastery at the base of Leopard Shan.
*The [[Snow Leopard style]] of [[martial arts]] practiced in [[Ra-Khati]] by the [[monk]]s of [[Lagiuri]], who wore [[gold]] pendants depicting a snow leopard.<ref><ref>
