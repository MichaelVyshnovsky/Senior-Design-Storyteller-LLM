A wemic (  century DR was about 500 gold pieces.
Wemics could be found in many lands of Faerûn, such as the Stonelands and Goblin Marches north of Cormyr, Pelleors Prairie in the Backlands, the Shining Plains of Turmish, and in great numbers in the grasslands of the Shaar. 
Beyond Faerûn, wemics could be found on the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur.
While wemics were often represented as barbaric, illiterate, and uncivilized creatures, they were quite intelligent and made stone weapons and tools, as well as clay pottery. They were famous for being highly superstitious. Others would describe wemics as nature-oriented people with a rich tradition of oral history.
They lived close to the land, in tune with its magical forces and in harmony with the nearby populations. While they held few opinions about other races, they were extremely careful not to over-hunt and would become enraged when humanoids hunted an animal of Toril for a small part of its body, such as a horn or other trophy, then leave the carcass for carrion. Ironically, the claws of wemics were prized as decorations by the bullywugs of Faerûn, and the hair of wemics were used in the creation of brooms of animated attack.
Within wemic prides, the females typically outnumbered the males three-to-one, including the younger cubs, who were tended by the females. When they werent looking over the young, females spent the days scouting or hunting while the males slept. The males of a pride stood guard over their kin at night, protecting them from nocturnal dangers. All wemics were trained from a young age to fight and defend themselves.
Young wemics would remain with the rest of the pride until they were five years old, at which point they would go on the first hunt. Once they brought back their first kill, they were considered an adult. or wandered off to the nearest humanoid settlement for a new life, so that they would not slow down their kin.

They hunted the nearby pack herds for a given amount of time before rotating to the next camp, allowing other prides and occasionally the local loxo herds to use the temporary settlements in their absence.
Many wemics of the Shaar worshiped the lion-god Nobanion, and their shamans led tribal celebrations such as the festival of the Pride. However a few of the more savage of their kind venerated Malar, the Beastlord.
