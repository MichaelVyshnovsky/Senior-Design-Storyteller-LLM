        "mainbody": "'''Ruby dragons''' were a rare species of [[gem dragon]]s who often were confused with [[red dragon]]s, however, unlike their chromatic cousins, ruby dragons were creatures that followed laws and stayed away from moral extremes.",
        "Description": "Ruby dragons had fine [[ruby]]-red shimmering and glistening scales, indistinguishable from those of red dragons from a distance of {{SI|120'|'\"|long=yes}} or further. Upon closer examination, their gem dragon nature became immediately apparent.",
        "Abilities": "Like other dragons, rubies' main weapon was their breath. Unlike their red kin, ruby dragons' breath was a wave of intense metal-melting magic heat that melted and ignited anything and anyone unlucky enough to be caught in the breath's way. The intensity of the heat increased as a ruby dragon aged. Items made of light materials, such as [[paper]], were incinerated instantly, [[leather]] was destroyed within 6 seconds, non-metallic items were destroyed within 12 seconds, and metals melted after 18 seconds. The heat of a ruby dragon's breath was intense enough to melt even [[enchanted]] metallic items, however, it took them 24 seconds or more to be destroyed. Magic items with ''[[Resistance|resistance to fire]]'' were just as vulnerable to this type of breath as other magic items, however it took twice as much time to become unusable. Even if affected magic items were quickly cooled, there was a chance parts of the enchantments were nullified.\n\nWith age, ruby dragons became completely immune to mundane and magical flames and heat. Their jeweled hides granted ruby dragons good protection and resistance to cold.\n\nRuby dragons were able to take on [[humanoid]] shapes, seemingly for an indefinite amount of time. Some, if not all ruby dragons, could use [[the Art]] innately. Some of the spells they could cast included ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[summon swarm]]'', and ''[[produce flame]]''.[[Chenowyn]]'s abilities, as far as they are known, differ significantly from those described in the ''[[Monstrous Compendium Mystara Appendix]]''. It is unclear if she is unusual for a ruby dragon, or if the ruby dragons of [[Toril]] differ from those of [[Mystara]].",
        "Personality": "Older ruby dragons enjoyed bathing in molten rock of lava and strolling along scorching magma.",
        "Combat": "When forced into confrontation, ruby dragons used their deadly super-heated breath, as well as their raking claws and powerful crushing jaws.",
        "Society": "Ruby dragons could be found in solitary existence as well as in tightly-knit clans and inhabited the same terrains as their red dragon cousins. Ruby dragon were known to build joined conclaves with red dragon on the tallest secluded mountaintops. However, ruby dragons were more likely venture into higher altitudes than red dragons. Most ruby dragons spoke their own [[ruby dragon language|language]], the [[gem dragon language|shared tongue of all gem dragons]], and the [[red dragon language|language of red dragons]].\n\nThese voracious gem dragons consumed meat as well as [[gemstone]]s. Because of that almost compulsive love for consuming the most dense and precious of gems, ruby dragons ofter attacked [[dwarves]] with glee, hoping to find delicious gems among their possessions. Ruby dragons valued gems above all else and happily accepted such gifts, bribes, and offerings.\n\nRuby dragons could cross-breed with [[amethyst dragon]]s.",
        "History": "[[Sardior]] the Ruby Dragon, was believed to be the first of the ruby dragons. Some sages believed that Sardior hailed from the [[First World]] and upon his death, he shattered, giving birth to other gem dragons.",
        "Notable": "*[[Chenowyn]], a young female companion of queen [[Zaranda Star]] during the [[Reclamation Wars]] of [[Tethyr]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\"/>"
