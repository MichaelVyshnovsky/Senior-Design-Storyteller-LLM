        "mainbody": "Temnodontosaurus, also known as tennodontosaurus (), was a species of ichthyosaur living in Faer√ªn.\nTemnodontosaurs were massive marine animals.\nTemnodontosaurs were one of the top predators in their territory. Despite its size, they were very fast. They were ferocious predators, especially when they were in the midst of a feeding frenzy. They used their long, powerful tail as a weapon against prey and competing predators.\nTemnodontosaurs lived in the ocean, often sharing territory with mosasaurs.\nTemnodontosaurs were carnivores and solitary creatures. Their young was birthed live within the ocean. Temnodontosaurs were air breathers and as a result needed to frequently surface to breathe."
