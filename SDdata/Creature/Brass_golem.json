        "mainbody": "'''Brass golems''', also referred to as '''brass minotaurs''',{{Cite dragon/209/The Dragon's Bestiary: The golem workshop|87}}",
        "Behavior": "Brass golems typically stood in silent vigil, acting as though they were mere statues, only coming to life upon a triggering event, such as desecration of a shrine they were created to protect. Once active they were relentlessly focused upon the perpetrator of that triggering event, though would still fight to defend themselves from any other attackers.",
        "Abilities": "Some of these golems had the ability to cast ''[[maze]]'' once per day on a single target. They were immune to the effects of their own ability, as well as any similar [[spell]]. They were incredibly skilled trackers, especially when inside their maze, though only when it came to foes designated by a creator or connected to their singular goal. And they could freely enter the ''maze'' it created at any time to pursue their victim, completely vanishing from wherever they were standing.\n\nWhen standing within this ''maze'', the golem would slowly recover from any damage that had been dealt to it. Once their victim was slain, the extra-dimensional ''maze'' space would cease to exist, except if the minotaur themselves was still standing within it. Upon the next use of their ''maze'' ability, a new extra-dimensional space would be created.\n\nAdditionally, they could only be harmed by weapons with a ''+3'' or greater [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]. Any electricity-based effect would cause a brass golem to be rendered sluggish in movement, as if effected by the ''[[slow]]'' spell. They could partially be healed by [[fire]]-based effects, though were not impervious to harm from them. And if ''[[find the path]]'' were to be cast upon the area where a minotaur disappeared as it entered its own extra-dimensional ''maze'', the spell would cause both the minotaur and their trapped victim to be returned.",
        "Combat": "Brass golems were outfitted with either a ''+3 [[battle axe]] of wounding'' or a ''+3 [[greataxe]] of wounding'', both similar in effect to the [[sword of wounding|sword of the same name]], and were their primary means of fighting. For some brass golems, the haft end of these axes was inset with a large, flawless [[gem]], big enough that it couldn't be easily hidden within the confines of a fist. This gem acted as a focus for an effect mimicking the spell ''[[trap the soul]]'', which could be used once a day. Where it differed in effect from ''trap the soul'' was that those targeted would be sent to an extra-dimensional space, not unlike that created by a ''maze'' spell. These axes typically shattered upon the destruction of their brass golem.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Construction": "The process of creating them took around five months, in a specially prepared lab or workroom, and cost upwards of a 100,000 to 200,000 [[gold piece]]s. About 1,500 of those gold pieces were spent on the {{SI|1000|lb|k|long=yes}} of brass needed to construct the body and 32,320 of those gold pieces would be spent on the ''+3 axe of wounding''.\n\nThe {{SI|1000|lb|k|long=yes}} of brass had to be forged from its component ores,{{Cite dragon/123/Fire for Effect!|35}} When in a molten state these ores had to have powdered [[diamond]] sprinkled into them. About three handfuls of powdered diamond were needed. The molten brass was then to be poured into a mold, holding that of a perfect minotaur skeleton, with the brass taking the place of flesh.The 3{{rd}}-edition version of this creature omits any mention of a skeleton in its creation instructions. Thus it is unclear if creating brass golems resembling something other than a minotaur might also require skeletons of the desired shape. This part of the creation process could be done by either the creator themselves or by hired hands.\n\nAfter the golem's physical form was finished, the creator must cast a series of [[spell]]s upon it. The required spells included ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[maze]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', and ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[limited wish]]''. Either ''wish'' spell was meant to be cast last, acting as a binding agent for everything else. Additionally, some recipes called for also using the spell ''[[Mordenkainen's sword]]'', while others called for the spell ''[[strength]]''. If it was desired for the ''axe of wounding'' to be imbued with the ''maze'' effect instead of the golem itself, the caster would have to cast both ''maze'' and ''trap the soul'' on its gemstone."

        "History": "The very first of the brass golems in the [[multiverse]] was said to have been created on another world by a mage called Relnar the Just, to avenge the death of his [[priest]]ess wife after an attack and pillaging of her temple by three [[barbarian]]s. According to some sources, this was a temple dedicated to [[Olympian pantheon|Athena]]. Relnar planned to use a ''wish'' spell to send it back in time to the moment of the attack, but the next night, before he was even finished casting spells upon it, he received reports that the brass golem was standing guard over the temple site as it was being rebuilt.\n\nAround [[1374 DR]], brass golems were one of many varieties of golems used as guardians inside the [[Onyx Tower]]."
