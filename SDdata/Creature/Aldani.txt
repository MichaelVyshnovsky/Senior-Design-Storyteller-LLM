'''Aldani''', also known as '''lobster men''',<ref group="note" name="aldani">The book ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]'' conflates the creatures known as yurians with aldani. Though both are crustaceans with humanoid traits, the other details given for aldani in ''Jungles of Chult'' and ''Tomb of Annihilation'' do not mesh with those given for yurians. Because of this, they are considered to be distinct creatures. or '''lobsterfolk''', and lakes, but eventually isolated themselves to the swampy lakes of the [[Aldani Basin]].

==Description==
An aldani resembled a [[lobster]], but was the size of a [[human]] being. They walked upright on two [[humanoid]] legs, but swam like lobsters. Their faces vaguely resembled that of a human, though encased in chitinous armor and their eyes extend upon long stalks.

==Personality==
Despite their appearance, the aldani were highly intelligent and quite civilized race of beings.

==Combat==
When forced to engage in battle, alddani often fought to the death, using their large pincers.

==History==
According to [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] legend, the Aldani were once a peaceful tribe of fisherfolk, but when they brought all of the lobsters in a river to extinction by over-fishing, this angered the god [[Ubtao]], whose punishment was to turn them into the race of lobsterfolk. The fisherfolk readily accepted their punishment and new state of being. However, they were scorned by the rest of their Aldani tribesmen and cast out into the rivers they had so greedily plundered.

Around [[1363 DR]], [[Mainu]] of [[Mezro]], a ''[[bara]]'', dwelt in the [[River Olung]] with a dozen aldani guards in her throne room.

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]],{{ToA-time}} no reliable witnesses had seen the aldani for over a century, causing most Chultans to believe that the lobster folk had gone extinct. In reality, they had chosen to abandon their homes in the rivers in favor of secluding themselves in the Aldani Basin.

==Society==
These creatures once inhabited specific sections of the murky depths of Chults three largest rivers, the River Olung, [[River Tath]], and the [[River Soshenstar]].

Alani lived in communities of up to twenty individuals. They almost never left the water, thus few outsiders saw them outside this environment. They strictly patrolled their territory, with patrols accompanied by up to twenty trained [[piranha]]s. They also were known to scavenge for various treasures within the rivers and lakes they inhabited.
===Languages===
In addition to speaking their own language,<ref> the aldani generally understood and spoke [[Common]].
===Relationships===
The aldani were xenophobic creatures, preferring to keep to themselves.
