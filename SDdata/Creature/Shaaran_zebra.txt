The Shaaran zebra was a regional variety of zebra that roamed the plains of the Shaar and Eastern Shaar, in south and southeastern Faer√ªn.
The striped steeds of the Shaar were difficult to separate from their herd. Unlike other breeds of horses, zebras lived in a social structure that resembled a harem, with one polygamous male living among a group of many females.
The zebras were short, but light equine with heavy heads and full, thick manes. Their most unique characteristic was the distinct, vertical black and white striping of their coats.
Rather than a typical neigh or whinny common among other equines, zebras had a distinctive "bark", unique to their breed.
