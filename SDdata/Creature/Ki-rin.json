        "mainbody": "'''Ki-rins''' ({{Pronounce|kee|RINZ|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}} {{Pronounce|ky|RINZ|refs=|alt=yes}}) were noble creatures native to the [[celestial planes]], who either worked for [[good]]-aligned [[Deity|deities]] in direct opposition to the forces of [[evil]] or served as protectors of large areas of the mortal world. They were regarded as harbingers of good fortune, and days when a ki-rin was sighted were considered blessed.\n\n{{Quote|I was awed to tears at the mere sight of my first ki-rin, and I've met gods.|[[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo's]] notes in ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]''.}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Ki-rins were similar to [[unicorn]]s in some respects, as both were noble equine creatures with a single horn. They had stag-like bodies, but were covered in golden scales instead of fur,\n\nThe overall appearance of ki-rins varied depending on the [[power]] they served. Some looked like giant unicorns while others were more [[draconic]], and they could also vary in size, with some being as large as [[elephant]]s. Most had a spiral horn which, like their hooves, was pinkish-copper in color, but some had two horns, or even [[deer]]-like antlers.",
        "Personality": "Ki-rins rarely touched the ground, and were often found soaring through the skies in search of evil to smite and good deeds to be done. Although generous and not prone to greed, ki-rins accumulated treasures, some of which were created by other celestial beings and others of which were trophies and trinkets, mementos from villainous foes they had defeated.",
        "Abilities": "Ki-rins could fly without wings, and they had several other powerful spell-like innate abilities, including the ability to read the minds of those around them. They were extremely resistant to magic. Ki-rins had an ability to create supremely realistic ''illusions'' with auditory, visual, and olfactory elements.\n\nKi-rins, like many other creatures of good from the Upper Planes, were affected by ''[[unholy water]]''. It caused them to feel pain and burning sensation as if splashed with [[acid]].{{Cite dragon/22/Sneak Preview: AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide|37}}\n\nApart from their powerful innate spellcasting abilities, ki-rins could ''[[create food and water]]'' for up to twenty four individuals, create permanent soft goods or wooden items, create metallic items that disintegrated within two to five days (including [[adamantine]] items that lasted for about one hour), assume ''[[gaseous form]]'', cast ''[[wind walk]]'', ''[[call lightning]]'', and ''[[summon weather]]''. A ki-rin could use each of these abilities once a day. Any air-related effects, spells, or items created were of a more powerful or sturdy variety.\n\nThe ki-rin's power was so great that it affected areas outside their homes. Their celestial presence purified all running water within three miles of the lairs. When evildoers attempted to corrupt the waters magically or physically, the waters returned to their purified state within three minutes. The aura of ki-rin's home affected good-aligned creatures giving them strength and health, and it scared evil-aligned creatures away. Negative effects of ''[[curse]]s'', [[poison]]s, and [[disease]]s were temporarily lifted from good creatures, and if they were to fall from dangerous heights, ki-rin's winds protected them from harm, letting them gently descent to the ground. Upon ki-rin's death, all of these effects dispersed while the boons granted to creatures and plants in the area remained for three following years.\n\nKi-rins could enter the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] and [[Ethereal plane]]s at will.",
        "Combat": "Ki-rins almost always avoided combat unless faced with most evil creatures. If forced to fight, they would try to render their opponents unconscious. Their main means of physical attack were their powerful hooves and their horn that possessed magical power similar to that of a ''+3'' weapon enchantment.\n\nThey were almost impossible to surprise or ambush due to their ''telepathic'' abilities.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1991|267|Ki-rin}}",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "When occupying other planes, ki-rins lived in sophisticated aeries filled with reaches and elegance. Their homes felt as if they were a combination palace and temple, and though hard to access for outsiders, were open to their allies and followers. On occasion, ki-rins took on the mantle of being the protectors of certain towns or regions. When on the [[Prime Material plane]] they could be found lairing in high mountains or plateaus. Their habitats looked humble from the outside, but their interiors were flush with luxury, even if it paled in comparison to their homes on the planes. \n\nKi-rins were known to inhabit the highlands of the [[Moonshae Isles]] as well as northern forests and mountains of the [[Endless Waste]]. The [[Cloudlands]], a fabled aerial kingdom above the [[Stonelands]], was home to several creatures such as ki-rins, [[mist dragon]]s, and [[giant]]s.\n\nThese celestial creatures could sometimes be encountered on the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] and [[Ethereal plane]]s as they occasionally traversed them on their divine missions.",
            "Relationships": "Ki-rins were common allies of solars who had the ability to summon them in the times of need.{{Cite dragon/64/Featured Creatures|11}} \n\nKi-rins tended to ally mostly with [[Torm]], as well as with [[Tyr]] and [[Ilmater]]. Among other gods that counted ki-rins among their servants were: [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Corellon]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Sehanine Moonbow]], and [[Cyrrollalee]].\n\nKi-rins themselves worshiped their own patron deity [[Koriel]], though they had no [[priest]]s nor [[shaman]] among their ranks. Koriel was considered the creator of ki-rins. The god chose to directly commune with its followers when needed instead of sending visions and signs or communing via clergy. In times of strife, Koriel rather sent his loyal ki-rins to fulfill their god's will than deploying the avatar.\n\nKi-rins were often-summoned creatures. ''[[Ruavia's Steed]]'', an enchanted [[elf|elvish]] [[amulet]] from [[Evermeet]] allowed the wearer to summon several types of steeds, one of them being a ki-rin. The spell ''[[planar call]]'' allowed a [[wu jen]] to summon a specific planar creature that they knew by sight, ki-rins were among the creatures summonable. The spell ''[[call aerial beings]]'' granted by Aerdrie Faenya to her clerics, allowed them to summon several types of creatures, including ki-rins.\n\nKi-rins occasionally offered guidance to mortals who pledged themselves to the celestial horned creatures, training under them as [[monk]]s and serving as ki-rin's agents sniffing evil out across the lands."

        "Ecology": {
            "Usage": "[[File:Ki-Rin Hair.png|thumb|''A clump of ki-rin hair.''|260x260px]]\nKi-rin hair could be used to create ''[[youth elixir]]''. One portion of the elixir required 6 ounces of the creature's hair.{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy}} Similarly, after distilling ki-rin hair into an alchemical sublimate, one could create a ''[[potion of supreme healing]]''.\n\nAn eyelash from a ki-rin, [[ogre mage]], or a similar spell-casting creature, was a material component of the ''[[contingency]]'' spell{{Cite dragon/68/From the Sorcerer's Scroll|27}} and the spell of ''[[Elminster's evasion]]''. Hairs from ki-rin's tail could be used to boost potency of the ''[[banishment]]'' spell.{{Cite dragon/68/From the Sorcerer's Scroll|55}}\n\nKi-rin horns were used in magic and potion-making, but they were highly perishable. The deterioration could be stopped via the ''[[preservation]]'' spell.{{Cite dragon/49/Leomund's Tiny Hut: A recipe for the Alchemist|60}} One such item was the ''[[Horn of Doom]]'', a powerful artifact crafted out of a ki-rin's horn. The artifact could control the storms over the great areas.\n\nKi-rin's skin could be used to create ''[[Staff of power|staves of power]]''. The enchanter covered the unfinished staff with the skin and cast the required spells to complete the crafting process.{{Cite dragon/101/Charging isn't cheap|32}} One bundle of ki-rin's skin was valued at 25,000 [[gp]].{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|18}} Owning such a gruesome item was dangerous, however, as other ki-rins and good-aligned sympathetic creatures sought vengeance against those who desecrated bodies of goodly celestial beings.\n\nThe legendary [[book]] known as the ''[[Runes of Norzahk]]'' of [[Kara-Tur]] was bound in ki-rin hide that gave it a silvery-blue sheen and silky texture. And the Lord of High Water, [[Crow Dz Pong]], had gentle blue ki-rin fur trimming his coat, boots, and cloaks hood ''circa'' [[1357 DR]]."

        "History": "[[File:Ki-rin and Couatl.png|thumb|''Frolicking ki-rin and [[couatl]].''|360x360px]]\n{{Quote|The multiverse shines with countless wonders, yet I have seen so many of them that I am rarely awed. No so with ki-rin. They fill me with awe every time.|[[Mordenkainen]].}}\nIn [[1350 DR]], several ki-rin sought to stop an ancient [[red dragon]] [[Thorne]] who was using the ''Horn of Doom'' to pommel the realms with devastating storms. The artifact was created using a horn of a ki-rin whose spirit haunted the lair of the red dragon. Even though one of them perished in the dragon's dungeon, others aided the heroes from [[Phlan]] who came to face the wyrm.\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], the rulers of the [[Bloodstone Pass]] descended into the [[Abyss]] to find and destroy the source of [[Vaasa]]'s power, the [[Wand of Orcus]]. On Orcus's layer of the Abyss, the heroes encountered a [[solar]], being burnt on a stake with a hoard of demons dancing around in glee. When rescued, [[Gabriel]] summoned a ki-rin to aid the party's journey through hell.\n\n''Circa'' [[1359 DR]], a group of adventurers traveling through the [[Sixfold Path]] in [[Ra-Khati]] of the [[Hordelands]]. They encountered a ki-rin named [[Ba'Mit Ahn-so]] who was being tortured by a sadistic [[vampire]]. The celestial creature came to drive the [[undead]] out of the ruins of [[Solon]] but instead fell victim to the vampire's ambush. When rescued, ki-rin gifted the adventurers an ''[[amulet of steadfastness]]'' and shared knowledge of the undead-infested city.\n\n''Circa'' [[1366 DR]], an unknown force was standing guard over [[Sunbar]], protecting it from aerial threats from the [[Hellgate Keep]]. It was believed that it was either a ki-rin or a [[faerie dragon]] standing guard.\n\nDuring the same period of time, the shop known as a [[Handful of Eyes]] in [[Hill's Edge]] offered living monsters for purchase. Their stock varied from critters like [[snake]]s, [[rat]]s, [[spider]]s for 25 [[gp]], and rare powerful creatures like ki-rin that went for 350,000 [[gp]] or more.\n\nSometime before [[1367 DR]], King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] was saved from an assassin by a ki-rin in the tavern of [[Waymoot]] called [[the Moon and Stars]]. A crafty [[Zhentarim]] assassin ''[[polymorph]]ed'' himself into a [[beholder]] in attempt to slay the King of [[Cormyr]], but serendipitously was killed by a ki-rin who, in a guise of a man, was quietly playing cards at the back of the tavern at the time.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], [[alu-fiend]] [[Aliisza]] witnessed creatures from many alien universes during her visit to the [[Plain of Infinite Portals]], some of them beings she glimpsed were ki-rins.\n\nSometime after [[1486 DR]], an ancient [[red dragon]] [[Karrnsyrrl]] was released from his magical prison by [[Nadir]], a malevolent [[rakshasa]]. After raining destruction on [[Daggerford]], Karrnsyrrl made his way to the [[Moonshae Isles]] where it continued its rampage. The ki-rin defender of Moonshaes, [[Daiwon]] battles the beast in the skies over the islands. She repelled the wyrm but was gravely injured, retreating to her lair on the isle of [[Gwynneth]]. The group of heroes from Daggerford pursued the red dragon and eventually reached the dying ki-rin's lair. With their help, Daiwon reached the shores of [[Myrloch]] and departed the land, using the last of her strength to send the heroes to [[Calimshan]] in pursuit of Karrnsyrrl.",
