A '''gulguthra''', also known as a '''dung-eater''', was a type of [[aberration]]. The well-known gulghuthras of the [[Realms]] were [[otyugh]]s and [[neo-otyugh]]s.{{Cite dragon/96/The Ecology of the Gulguthra|20-22}}

==Description==
Gulguthras had tentacles that could grow up to 14 feet (4.3 meters) long, and they could communicate [[telepathy|telepathically]]. However, gulguthras rarely used this form of communication, as they often did not interact with other creatures. Relying on their keen visual sense, such creatures could sense others with [[infravision]] and [[ultravision]], but could not smell.

Every seven years, gulguthras would reproduce by creating eggmass, a gelatinous mass of eggs. The ovulating gulguthras would then descend underground to find other dung eaters, and regurgitate the eggmass. Any other gulguthra, even those of a different type, could then fertilize the eggmass, but the details of this process were unknown. As all dung eaters were bisexual,<ref group="note">The source says "bisexual", but this most likely is meant to mean hermaphroditic. it was not often difficult to find a mate willing to fertilize the eggmass. After a while, the fertilized eggmass would produce a newborn gulguthra, which would then become adults in approximately four months.

==History==
[[Elminster Aumar]] studied such creatures, from their combat abilities to their ecology. The sage had garnered information from the knowledgeable [[svirfnebli]], as well as a [[sorcerer]] called [[Jovriam of the Mines]].

Rare creatures that lurked in the [[Farsea Marshes]], known as [[gulguthydra]]e, were the combination of gulguthras and [[hydra]]e.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Some gulguthras were known to inhabit the [[Marsh of Chelimber]].
