They monitored the activities of other devils, vigilantly reporting their activities and ensuring their obedience. Their role as taskmasters was taken extremely seriously, as they constantly sought to inspire other devils to uphold the ideals of [[lawful evil]] through brutal disciplinary action and severe motivational techniques.",
        "mainbody": "hey mostly congregated on the lower circles of Hell, especially [[Stygia]], and also made up the bulk of [[Mammon]]'s personal servants along with [[hamatula]]. They often roamed the layers of Hell, occasionally grouping together as inquisitors, to exterminate heresy and force hesitant baatezu into battle. When brought to the mortal realms under the command of dictators and tyrants, their talent for spotting disloyalty and incompetence, in even small amounts, was abundantly clear.\n\nAs the only baatezu with authority over those of higher rank, osyluths were also among the most hated. Rather than the supervision itself, the method of punishment accessible to bone devils meant that most baatezu with a chance of getting away with it would kill them. If through whatever enigmatic interrogation methods they found a devil guilty of breaking baatezu law, they had permission to send an offender to the [[Phlegethos#Pit of Flame|Pit of Flame]] on [[Phlegethos]]. Once sent there, the offender would experience the agonizing infernal energies of the Pit for one hundred and one days before being returned to their former positions, having presumably learned their lesson.\n\nIf however, the criminal attempted to kill an osyluth and was caught a much more frightening punishment was enacted. The attempted killer was transformed into a lemure and branded with a mark denoting that they were never to be promoted again, and such lemures were hated by all other baatezu. Osyluths were believed to be the agents of the [[pit fiend]]s, but regardless of the truth of such a claim, their disciplinary jurisdiction over higher-ranking baatezu stopped at them.\n\nWhile the Dark Eight were the ones in charge of the promotion of [[gelugon]]s to pit fiends, the bone devils held an important role in the decision. Every century, one hundred osyluths joined in a moot named after the deceased founder of the [[Dark Eight]], [[Cantrum]]. The osyluths gathered in a ring around the Dark Eight presenting their various reports on the moral character and competency of gelugons promising enough to be considered. The hundred osyluths had a single combined vote within the process.\n\n===Promotion===\n[[File:Painful_Promotion.png|thumb|right|250px|An osyluth achieves his long-desired advancement into a hamatula.]]\nAfter the Ring of Cantrum concluded 1,000 osyluths were promoted into hamatula and 1,000 lower-ranking devils were turned into osyluths. To counteract this guaranteed advancement system osyluths who surpassed the usual high standards of their station advanced into [[amnizu]]. Somehow this fact became distorted to the point where most mortals believed that only 1,000 osyluths existed at once, a rumor possibly started by other devils in order to make the caste seem weak.\n\nWhen an osyluth was promoted to an amnizu, it underwent a process that was potentially lethal. The process consisted of racking, drawing, and quartering. When the osyluth got quartered, it naturally lost its limbs, but new smaller ones regrew. Once every limb was gone and replaced with a smaller one, the skin of the face was peeled to create a cowl that the would-be-amnizu had to remove through will-power, lest it died.\n\n===Styx===\nBecause the [[merrenoloth]]s refused to partake in the [[Blood War]], it sometimes fell to the few osyluths that tried to learn the twists of the River [[Styx]] to become the boatmen of the baatezu. However, as Baatorian history accounts tried to cover up, entire fleets had been lost in the past to waterfalls, whirlpools, and rocks when the osyluth steering the navy made a wrong turn or misread one of the signs of the Styx, so ultimately the devils were reliant on the [[yugoloth]]s for safe passage.\n\n===Spellcasters===\n[[File:OsyluthInquisition.png|thumb|left|250px|''A trio of inquisitive osyluth priests.'']]\nOsyluth had the necessary mental capacity to learn [[wizard]]ry, possessing a talent for the art of [[divination]] that was commonly used to aid them in their duties, although only a rare few bothered learning magic. Another branch of magic osyluths pursued was that of divine magic tied to a [[deity]].

Despite being {{SI|500|lb|k}} creatures, their frames were incredibly gaunt husks so emaciated that they seemed skeletal. Their tails were those of giant scorpions while their heads looked like menacing skulls. The putrid stench of rot surrounded their fearsome forms.",
        "Personality": "Osyluths were malicious sadists that reveled in the pain of lesser creatures, yet still exercised a patient vigilance and cunning. They were expected to show absolute adherence to the tenets of [[baatezu]] morality and to the will of their masters, with most being fanatically loyal or at least obedient, and encouraged other baatezu to show similar levels of viciousness and zeal.",
        "Abilities": "Osyluths capable of exuding an aura of [[fear]] within a {{SI|5|ft}} radius of themselves to send their foes running in panic. Their other innately magical abilities allowed them to [[fly]], turn themselves [[invisibility|invisible]], craft powerful illusions, and create a [[wall of ice]]. They were also capable of summoning somewhere between 1-100 [[nupperibo]]s, a small group of [[lemure]]s or [[spinagon]]s, or up to two other osyluths.",
        "Combat": "Driven into combat by ruthless rage, osyluths violently lashed out with tooth and claw, surrounding themselves with terror to keep their enemies from fighting back. Although capable of fighting unarmed, they often wielded hooked polearms constructed from bones to snare and wound their foes. Once their opponents' bodies were restrained and their resolve shattered, a bone devil could fully subdue them with their tail venom. They normally focused on singular foes and divided groups using their wall of ice.",
