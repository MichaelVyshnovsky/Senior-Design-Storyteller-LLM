        "mainbody": "Revilers were evil undead incorporeal spirits, somewhat similar to haunts, created by malevolent deities to spread discord and suffering and corrupt all things pure.\nMost of the time, revilers stayed invisible until it was time to possess an unsuspecting victim. During that time, they appeared as an incorporeal ghostly ever-shifting shape of grasping appendages, claws, and skulls. Eery whispers sometimes accompanied revilers even when they were invisible.\nWhen affected by detect undead, detect evil, or detect invisibility, revilers lost the upper hand of being invisible, while the true seeing spell revealed the monsters true shape to the caster.\nRevilers had powerful spell-like abilities. They could cast each of the following spells once per day animate object, suggestion, spectral force, and stone shape, while  detect good, detect magic, telekinesis, and wizard lock could be cast three times per day.\nTwice a day, a reviler could turn any liquid into deadly poison as long as it was within . Other beings internal fluids could not be affected. Several revilers were known to pool their powers together to poison wells, ponds, springs, and other water sources likely to attract goodly creatures. Once turned, poison remained potent from two to twelve hours. These affected sources of water could be cleansed by casting neutralize poison, remove disease, or purify food and drink spells.\nRevilers were incorporeal and could pass through solid objects. However, doing so slowed them down. Like many other undead, they were immune to sleep, charm, hold and other mind-affecting magics and abilities. They were also unaffected by poisons, venoms, and paralyzation. And like their walking dead kin, they could be turned by goodly clerics, and were vulnerable to holy water. Powerful divine spells like holy word and dispel evil could permanently banish the from the Prime Material plane. Revilers could only be harmed by magical weaponry of at least +1 enchantment.\nWhen communicating with others, revilers spoke in forbidding hollow whispers. Most knew Common and possessed knowledge of all languages they knew in life.\nRevilers despised all things good and pure. They existed to corrupt and turn creatures towards evil. Those affected by revilers corrupting touch, in turn, sown strife and destruction.\nThe spirits had two razor-sharp claws they could rake their victims with but only when visible. However, revilers most dangerous ability was the corruption of goodly or neutral creatures. These undead beings could affect the targets mind, twisting and corrupting their ethics and morals with a touch. This morality shift was permanent unless reversed via remove curse, dispel evil, or similar spell. Furthermore, a reviler could only attempt to corrupt a creature once. If the attempt failed, the creature became immune to any further attempts by the same individual reviler.\nRevilers haunted old derelict and abandoned buildings and ruins, occasionally even encountered within catacombs and graveyards. They were spawned by evil gods and often tethered to one location, unable to leave without their masters direction. The buildings or areas haunted by revilers radiated evil and often attracted other evil or undead beings.\nRevilers were birthed from should of malicious and evil creatures. In their undeath, revelers served their dark masters in hopes of being eventually released from this existence. However, this torturous state only made them more evil and migrant than they were in life.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, Revilers haunted the ruins of the Holk House, located at the eastern part of the Mere of Dead Men."
