        "mainbody": "Mountain goats were alpine mammals.\nMountain goats had thick, white fur and a thick layer of fat. This provided it with ample protection from the cold.\nMountain goats were territorial and had a reputation for being incredibly stubborn creatures. As a result, they were quite difficult to domesticate.\nMountain goats were sure-footed on most alpine terrain. Their superb climbing ability allowed them to scale even the steepest of cliffs and they were capable of jumping from one narrow ledge to another.\nWhen threatened, a mountain goat rammed its opponent.\nMountain goats could be encountered throughout the Realms, including Adamas Tooth, Fimbrul, Ice Peak, Kelvins Cairn, the mountains of Maztica, Shalhoond, Shining Plains, the Spine of the World, the Tannath Mountains, the Valley of Echoes and the World Pillar Mountains.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, mountain goats could be found in the land of Barovia.\nGoliath tribes were known to tend herds of mountain goats and their youths sometimes used them as mounts.\nOreads sometimes developed friendships with mountain goats.\nMountain goats could be employed as cavalry. Known examples include the goblin and orcs of the Shining Plains\n* Mountain goats were the holy symbol of the outsider deity Enki."
