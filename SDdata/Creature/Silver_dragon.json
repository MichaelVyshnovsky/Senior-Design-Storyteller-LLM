        "Description": "[[File:Silver dragon anatomy - Richard Sardinha.jpg|thumb|210px|''An overview of silver dragon anatomy.'']]\nThe silver dragon was regal and statuesque.\n\nAt first glance, a silver dragon appeared very similar to a white dragon. The wings were more curved than a white's, however, and a silver had two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also had a beautiful frill that began at the top of its head and flowed all the way down its neck and body to the tip of its tail. The frill was silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They had two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also had a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which had the rough appearance of a goatee. They smelled like rain.\n\nThey were very intelligent, more so than most humans, extremely powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and had lifespans that could reach 4,200 years.",
        "Personality": "[[File:Ancient Silver Dragon.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The majesty of an ancient silver dragon reflected their protective nature.'']]\nUnlike the [[gold dragon|gold]] and [[bronze dragon]]s, the silver dragon did not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. Instead, it waited for others to ask them for help; They would attempt to right an injustice if they saw one, but they had no inclination to intentionally seek evil out and destroy it. Silver dragons were more interested in protecting the humans or elves that came to its care.\n\nOne unusual trait they had was the love of human dining; moreover, they would use their alternate form ability to take part in large feasts.",
        "Activities": "A silver dragon enjoyed the company of [[human]]s and [[elf|elves]] so much that it would often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life. However, it should be noted that silvers, like all dragons, believed themselves the most superior creatures in the world. However, apart from the ability to fly, which they enjoyed greatly, they tended to prefer the physical forms of humanoids for everyday life.",
        "Combat": "Like most metallic dragons, silvers did not enjoy combat, and were averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they were as deadly as any other dragon.\n\nSilver dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a cone of freezing cold, similar to that of white dragons. The second was a cone of paralyzing gas.",
        "Society": {
            "Lair": "A silver dragon's lair was typically found within an icy mountain.",
            "Family and Parenting": "A newly hatched silver wyrmling had scales of a bluish gray, which changed to silver over time.\n\nSilver dragon living with non-dragons would grow attached to them and maintain a long-term relationship. As they died, the silver dragon, grieved by the loss, continued to associate with their descendants, remaining a friend through many generations. If the dragon felt they could trust these non-dragons enough, it might even decide to reveal its true self."

        "History": "[[File:House of the Moon - silver dragon.jpg|thumb|right|''Not actually a silver dragon in any case.'']]\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] of the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], a brainwashed [[Luna]] used ''[[shapechange]]'' to turn into a silver dragon and attacked her friends [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Kyriani Agrivar]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Timoth Eyesbright]] outside the [[House of the Moon]]. However, the spell did not last long, and she quickly reverted to human form.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|2-4}}<ref group=\"note\">The cover of \"[[Total Eclipse]]\" depicts a red-colored dragon breathing fire, presumably a [[red dragon]], but the comic itself shows a silver- or white-colored dragon breathing a green substance. The dragon in the comic most closely resembles a silver dragon, so this is assumed here. A silver dragon is also more suitable for an avatar of the goddess [[Sel√ªne]].",
