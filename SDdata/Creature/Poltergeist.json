        "mainbody": "'''Poltergeists''' were invisible [[undead]] creatures.",
        "Description": "Poltergeists were invisible to all creatures except those who had the ability to see invisible creatures and objects. When visible, a poltergeist looks like a [[human]] clothed in tattered rags and  wrapped with heavy [[chain]]s, upon which were attached items that represented the evil actions the poltergeist committed when alive.",
        "Personality": "Poltergeists were malicious and wicked. Their sole purpose was to inflict suffering on the living. This undying, destructive rage was fueled by their confusion over having no sense of how they had died.",
        "Abilities": "Poltergeists projected an aura of ''[[fear]]'' around them.",
        "Combat": "Poltergeists harassed the living by throwing objects at them. If a person was hit with such an object, they were not harmed. A poltergeist could only be hurt or killed by magical weapons or a weapon made from [[silver]]. Holy symbols of good-aligned [[cleric]]s temporarily drove a poltergeist from the area.",
        "Society": {
            "Habitats": "Poltergeists could be found throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. They were encountered in [[Icewind Dale]], [[Orvaskyte Keep]], the [[Rat Hills]], [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Solon]], [[Undermountain]], and [[Waterdeep]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], poltergeists could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].",
            "Relationships": "Poltergeists were one of many types of undead known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of [[Velsharoon]]."
