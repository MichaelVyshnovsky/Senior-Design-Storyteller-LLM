Lolthbound goblins were a subrace of goblins that first appeared in the Realms following the Spellplague, having developed over centuries from drow enslavement warping the minds and bodies of goblin slaves.
These goblins differed from other goblins visually by their purple skin.
Lolthbound were noted as being madly devoted towards both the drow and their goddess Lolth, having lost their sense of free will and devotion to Maglubiyet. They dedicated their lives to protecting their drow masters.
Some Lolthbound could unleash a deafening shriek that posed no harm to drow, other goblins, or spiders. They could also see in areas of total darkness.
Lolthbound typically dressed in leather armor festooned in webs. They fought with crossbows or war picks laced in poison.
Lolthbound goblins could be found in the drow city of Zadzifeir and among the members of House Xorlarrin.
The Lolthbound were universally reviled by other goblinoids due to their devotion to both the drow and Lolth.
