        "mainbody": "ponges were immobile aquatic creatures that lived on sea floors. Their harvest and sale as household objects was lucrative.\nSponges lived as far deep as the upper depths, or between .\nWhen harvested and crushed repeatedly for a time, the skeleton of a sponge became exceptionally absorbent, able to retain a large amount of moisture that could be wrung out later. In this form, sponges were generally available in most towns and markets, including Auroras Emporium, which acquired them from farms in the Shining Sea off Tharsult. Sponges cultivated in the Sea of Swords were commonly found in use across the Western Heartlands and the city of Baldurs Gate.\nThe kingdom of Esdaan farmed sponges in great numbers, and the creatures were a staple food source in Asarem and Myth Nantar.\nReef giants were adept foragers of sponges, and were able to bring up whole hoards of them for trade.\nSponges were components for the spells Abi-Dalzims horrid wilting, numbing sphere, wall of water, and wildshield. A dried sponge was also used in the creation of a potion of growth."
