        "mainbody": "Oscray were a group of scro found on the Ravannah Savannah of the Malatran Plateau.Though scro were not specifically named in their entry, the description and background of oscray heavily mirrors them. In addition, they reuse the art used for scro in Monstrous Compendium Spelljammer Appendix II. Also, the word \"oscray\" is the word \"scro\" in [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin pig latin].\nScro bore a resemblance to the average orc, but were larger and had greyish skin. They had tusks, which were often filed to a sharp point.\nThe minds of oscray were typically well suited to combat, being disciplined and having a type of cunning that was rooted in strategy and tactics. They always looked out for each other above all else.\nOscray were known to fight with the typical Malatran weaponry of daggers, handaxes, shortbows, long knives, long spears, and half-spears. They often made a point to insult their enemies. They forged chainmail and many weapons from brass.\nThe oscray were descended from a group of scro who had fled on spelljamming vessels from their far off war with the Elven Imperial Fleet.\nThe oscray engaged in some level of agriculture, though they primarily relied upon hunting.\nAll oscray lived within a village in the Ravannah Savannah of the Malatran Plateau, well to the north of the territory of the Wise Ones tribe of Nubari.\nAt first the oscray relied upon smelting down their own possessions and stripping down their spelljammers for brass, but eventually established trade relations with the aarakocra of the Forbidden Mountains. The aarakocra would scan the mountains for any raw copper ore they could find and once they collected  worth of copper they would make the long trek to the oscray village. They traded this copper with the oscray in return for brass javelin heads, which were considered an item of prestige among the aarakocra of the Forbidden Mountains.\n* Bentfang, chieftain of the oscray.\n* One-Arm, the master smith of the oscray."
