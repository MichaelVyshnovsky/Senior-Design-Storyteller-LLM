'''Storks''' were a variety of wading [[bird]]s.

==Ecology==
Storks were preyed upon by [[eagle]]s.

===Habitats===
Storks were found in the [[Sumber Hills]], and would nest in such places as [[Gladestone]].

In ancient [[Netheril]], white storks were a symbol of the floating [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Eileanar]].

Beyond [[Faer√ªn]], storks nested among the trees of the [[Katakoro Plateau]]. Storks were especially common in [[Huzuz]].

Across the oceans, storks also lived in [[Maztica]], and were a feature of the pool at the [[Palace of Kukul]] at [[Tulom-Itzi]].

==Notable Storks==
Circa the {{yearlinkName|1492}},{{WDH-time}} [[Arcturia]] was served by a stork she turned into a stork-headed humanoid.
