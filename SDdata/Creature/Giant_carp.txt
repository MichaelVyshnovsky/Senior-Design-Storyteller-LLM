Giant carp were a species of large carp native to Kara-Tur.
The giant carp was covered in shiny gold scales. It had a large dorsal fin and a muscular tail fin. Often the pectoral and pelvic fins of a giant carp were tattered, due to chafing as the giant carp searched for food among rocks. It had a large mouth filled with sharp teeth.
Giant carp were acquiescent and often harmless, but when provoked they have been known to attack boats or swimming humanoids. They were aggressive towards other creatures when feeding or spawning. Its main form of attack was by biting a target, and they were able to swallow a small- to medium-sized humanoid whole. 
The giant carp had a lifespan of 50 years, and reached sexual maturity at about 10 years of age. A female giant carp would lay thousands of eggs to be fertilized at a time. 
Giant carps spent most of their time searching for food, eating the organic matter that settled at the bottom of lakes and rivers. When the opportunity arose, they supplemented their diet by eating insects, crustaceans, amphibians, snakes, and plankton.
Giant carp lived in freshwater lakes and rivers across Kara-Tur.
Across Kara-Tur, the giant carp was a symbol of wealth and perseverance. It was often caught at a young age and sold to noble families or temples, and placed in a courtyard pond. Kara-Turan superstition stated that a giant carp would protect wealth. They were fished for their meat by several Kara-Turan races. This was a dangerous task since the giant carp would fight to defend itself. As a single mature giant carp could sustain a small village for a few weeks if the meat was smoked, fishing for giant carp was considered worth the risk.
