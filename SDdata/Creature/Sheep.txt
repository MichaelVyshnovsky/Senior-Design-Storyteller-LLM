'''Sheep''' were a common species of mammal and herd animal.
{{quote
|''The sheep gives the shepherd its fleece or there'll be mutton for dinner.''
|An old saying from the [[Dalelands]]. 
}}
==Description==
Sheep were covered in thick, curly wool. The color of the wool varied, often black, white or yellow in color. Male sheep had a pair of sharp horns on their head.

==Behaviour==
Sheep were domesticated and lived in herds of various sizes.
==Combat==
Sheep avoided combat, fleeing predators when possible. Male sheep defended their herds, charging{{Cite dragon/187/The Wild, Wild Wilderness|12}} a target and inflicting damage with their sharp horns. A herd could panic and stampede, trampling most creatures in their path.

==Biology==
Many creatures hunted sheep. Including:

:[[boobrie]] • [[brass dragon]] • [[chiang lung]] • [[cloud giant]] • [[dire hawk]] • [[displacer beast]] • [[giant toad]] • [[goblin rat]] • [[hill giant]] • [[kappa]] • [[Morin (creature)|morin]] • [[nightbeak]] • [[oni]] • [[orpsu]] • [[red dragon]] • [[wolf]] • [[wyvern]] • [[yeti]]

==Uses==
A flock of sheep was tended by shepherds. The larger the flock, the more shepherds were needed to safely manage the sheep.
[[File:Shepherd.png|thumb|A shepherd and his flock.]]
Shepherds moved flocks from one area to another for grazing. This was due to the fact that sheep, when grazing, ate grass in its entirety, including roots. This combined with the damage caused by many sets of hooves, degraded the soil and left it exposed to the sun and wind. Improper management of a flock of sheep could turn a once lush field into a barren dusty field.

Among the Al-Badia tribes, shepherds were usually young men or boys. They led the flock to find suitable grazing ground. However, in the summer, grazing is practically nonexistent, so the Al-Badia tribes remain close to an oasis or settlement.

Sheep were herded by both [[Gold dwarves|gold]] and [[Shield dwarves|shield]] dwarves.

As livestock, a typical sheep was worth between 1 and 2 [[gp]] in [[Faerûn]], and between 3 and 6 gp in [[Zakhara|Zakharan]] bazaars.. In [[Kara-Tur]], a sheep was worth up to 5 [[tael]].

;Clothing:
Sheep were a source of wool. Zakharan wool was made from hair of a sheep blended with that of a [[camel]]. [[Fleece]] was a type of textile fiber, obtained from sheering the coats of sheep.

Sheep could be used as a source of leather. Sheepskin clothing was common and could be worn as a jacket. The [[Hobgoblin]] tribes of the [[High Moor]] manufactured high quality sheepskin clothing, complete with intricate embroidery and bead-work. Sheepskin could also be used to make boots, such as [[high boots]].

;Food:
[[File:Elturian_grey-2e.jpg|thumb|Elturian Grey.]]
The milk from a sheep could be used to make [[cheese]]. In [[Sigil]], sheep's milk was often sweetened with [[vanilla]].

Among [[halfling]]s, sheep were considered a valuable part of a farm, and the milk and meat from sheep was an integral part of halfling cuisine.  Halfling farmers in [[Corm Orp]] made a soft cheese from [[goat]]'s and sheep milk called Orthin.

In Zakhara, butter was made from sheep's milk. A popular drink, [[Midani dictionary#R|''rakiq'']], was a beverage made from sheep's milk and garlic known for its tang. The [[Al-Badia]], nomadic tribes who roamed Zakhara, used mutton as the main course for banquets for honored guests. The considered the tail of a sheep a delicacy, with the guest of honor presented the fatty and succulent dish.

Kragh is an alcoholic beverage made by cyclopskin. It is made from fermented goat's or sheep's milk.{{Cite dragon/254/The Ecology of the Cyclopskin|104}}

;Other Uses:

If needed, a sheep could also be used as a pack animal.

Sheepskin was prepared in such a way it was used as a parchment. It could also be fashioned into a portable vessel for carrying water or wine. In Zakhara, sheepskin was part of a camel's riding kit, where it was used as a saddle pad.
[[File:CamelSaddle.png|thumb|A sheepskin saddle pad.]]
A [[Midani dictionary#H|''hababa'']] was a hammock made from sheepskin that was stretched over four poles of wood. It was used in Zakhara for children. Sheepskin could also be made into a rug.

On the [[Plain of Horses]], most of the structures are yurts made from the skin of sheep or camels.

Sheepskin could also be used as bed-sheet.

The bladder of a sheep could be inflated and used as a ball in recreational activities. Sheep's bladder was also used as a coin purse.

Sheep fat had several uses. It was used to make the wearer's skin glisten and shine. Candles could be made from sheep fat.

Paladin's often used sheep as part of their daily exercise routine. This routine involved the paladin, in a full suit of armor, hiking up a mountain with a sheep strapped to their back.

Sheep were sometimes used as a sacrificial animal. Once a month, the villagers of [[Volkumburgh]] transported up to five sheep to [[Mount Drakkor Rouge]]. There, the sheep were offered as a sacrifice to the [[red dragon]] [[Larghauseth]], in hopes of keeping the dragon away from their village. When entering an unexplored dungeon, uncaring adventures were known to send a flock of sheep ahead of them to trigger any [[trap]]s that laid ahead.

In the [[High Country]], there were certain locations felt to be important to the [[High Country#Inhabitants|Hidden People]], such as sparkling pools, the rare standing stones, and small hidden dells thick with old, mossy trees. Wise and experienced shepherds avoided such places. If forced to enter by weather or misfortune, they made no fires and cut no trees, moved stealthily, and did their business quickly and left as soon as possible. They humbly and loudly apologized for the intrusion, and even left one or two sheep tied to stakes as payment. Those who did not take such precautions did not always return.

On [[Olympus]], an individual who wished to cast a necormantic spell had to request it from [[Hecate]], and a sheep was an acceptable sacrifice.

==Habitat==
Sheep were common across the Realms and beyond. Unlike most herd animals, sheep thrived in rocky terrain and mountain pastures. Sheep tolerated cold and temperate climates well, but did not tolerated hot climates such as deserts or areas where the temperature exceeded {{SI|70|F}}. Sheep preferred to stay out of forests and swamps. 

===Faerûn===

[[File:High Moor Sheep.png|thumb|Human shepherds of the High Moor with a flock of sheep.]] 

The [[Song of the Morning]] was a large temple dedicated to the deity [[Lathander]] in the center of [[Beregost]]. On the east side of town were hills where its clergy tended flocks of sheep. While shepherding their livestock among the foothills, the temple's priests kept a watchful eye over the unguarded eastern expanse of Beregost.

Despite the fact that the land surrounding [[Baldur's Gate]] was in poor condition for farming, farmers herded sheep and other livestock. Paddocks full of sheep were found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Outer City|Outer City]].

In the remote fields of [[Harrowdale]], [[Mistledale]], and [[Tasseldale]], nomadic [[wemic]] shepherds tended flocks of up to 300 sheep. They traveled from field to field and tended to allow the sheep to overgraze, leaving damaged and depleted fields in their wake. The wemic shepherds trained wild cats to help manage and protect the flocks. They avoided contact with others, responding with violence unless a stranger was seeking to trade [[turquoise]] for wool.

In [[Battledale]], large expanses of pastoral fields were ideal for sheep grazing.

During the summer, shepherds from [[Harrowdale]] set their flocks to graze the tall grasses in the [[Cold Field]], located between Harrowdale and [[Scardale]]. The sheep merely ignored restless spirits found in the Cold Field.

In [[Shadowdale]], sheep were often left on their own to graze on the grasses of the Common in the center of the village. The sheep usually wandered over to [[Elminster's Tower]] to drink from the small pond that was located there.
