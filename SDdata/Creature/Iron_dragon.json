        "mainbody": "Iron dragons were intelligent and deadly dragons that preferred to subdue rather than kill intruders. They were the most powerful of the ferrous dragons.\nIron dragons were a larger variety of dragon, with wyrmlings being at least  long and great wyrms being as much as  long (body length , tail length ). They had broad, almost shovel-shaped heads with multiple thick, backwards-pointing horns, and large plates that resembled shark fins ran down their spine. Their scales were a glossy, metallic black that, after adulthood, began to take on silver highlights great wyrm scales looked like moonlight on a dark, rippling pool.\nIron dragons, like all of the ferrous dragons, were lawful in nature, adhering to a strict hierarchy. Like the other ferrous dragons, they were determined to reclaim their groups prestige, which was lost after a long and bloody war amongst their kind.\nIron dragons possessed many different abilities common to the true dragons, such as darkvision and blindsense. They could assume an alternate form, that of an average-sized animal or humanoid, three times each day. Great wyrm iron dragons could, once each day, turn creatures to iron in a manner similar to the flesh to stone spell.\nIron dragons also had innate spell-like abilities. By the time they were at least young they could replicate heat metal three times each day, juveniles gained stone shape twice each day, by adulthood they could replicate detect thoughts twice each day, ancients could replicate transmute rock to mud twice each day, and old ones could replicate wall of iron twice each day.\nAdditionally, iron dragons were known to have two different breath weapons a cloud of sleep gas, and a  cone of electrical sparks. The cloud of sleep gas was typically measured at  long,  wide, and  high, while the sparks formed a cone about  wide at the dragons mouth and   in diameter at the far end.\nLike all ferrous dragons, iron dragons also possessed metalsense, a peculiar ability that allowed them to sense both the location and amount of any non-precious metal within at least  of them (as wyrmlings great wyrms could sense it up to  away). This proved a great hindrance for anyone trying to sneak up on them while carrying any weapons or armor made of steel or other non-precious metals.\nthumb|250px|right|An iron dragon swipes a claw at a wagon.\nIron dragons were far more interested in acquiring information than in fighting, and preferred to use diplomacy or intimidation to avoid combat if possible. If they were drawn or forced into battle, they preferred to subdue or incapacitate opponents, either with spells, spell-like abilities, or their sleep-inducing breath weapon, before questioning them for information. However, they usually ate enemies after learning everything they could although iron dragons were not completely merciless, they always expected some form of payment in return for such kindness.\nIron dragons, like the other ferrous dragons, were arranged into family groups, two or three of which made up a clan clans were ruled by the oldest and/or most powerful member of the clan. There were several clans of iron dragons, each with a specific place in the hierarchy of the iron dragons. The iron dragons as a whole were ruled by a sovereign great wyrm to whom the clan leaders reported to directly this sovereign in turn answered to the Supreme Dragon of the ferrous dragons, Gruaghlothor. Some accounts claimed that the sovereign had a telepathic link with each clan leader, and that Gruaghlothor had a telepathic link with the sovereign. In the overall hierarchy of the ferrous dragons, the iron dragons were the highest ranking, although they did not officially have any authority over the other four types.\nIron dragons loathed red dragons, who they saw as a stain upon the reputation of all dragonkind the red dragons in turn hated the iron dragons just as much and viewed them as pathetic intruders. Iron dragons were also known to come into conflict with dwarves and other peoples that mined iron ore.\nthumb|250px|right|A hunting iron dragon.\nIron dragons typically lived in hills or mountains, preferentially near deposits of iron ore, in temperate, subtropical, and even tropical climates there were also a few reports of iron dragons living in dense forests. They laired in caves deep underground and hoarded iron ore more than any other material, as they needed it for part of their reproductive cycle. Iron dragons also fed primarily on iron ore, although they could sustain themselves on almost any anything.\nOn Toril, iron dragons had been recorded in several locations, such as in the peaks south of Taak Lake, in the Glittering Spires, and in the Giants Belt Mountains. An entire family was reportedly lairing in the Sunrise Mountains, and there was reports of a particularly angry one living in the mountains north of the northeastern end of Icelace Lake.[https//twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1024681251507261440]\nGruaghlothor - The ruler of all ferrous dragons and the first ferrous dragon to ever exist."
