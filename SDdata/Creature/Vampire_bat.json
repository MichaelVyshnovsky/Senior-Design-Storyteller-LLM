        "mainbody": "'''Vampire bats''' and their '''giant vampire bat''' cousins were species of flying living creatures that fed on mammalian blood, unlike their fruit and insect feeding relatives. Vampire bats were often associated with [[lycanthrope]]s and [[vampire]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Like other [[bat]]s, vampire bats relied on echolocation rather than sight when flying and hunting in the night skies. Echolocation was a type of auditory radar sense what was achieved by bats screeching and receiving echoes of the sound bouncing off objects and obstacles. Because of reliance of hearing, vampire bats had a weak eyesight which made them virtually immune to spells and abilities that blinded the targets or affected them via light. However spells such as ''[[silence]]'' effectively crippled and \"blinded\" vampire bats.\n\nGiant vampire bats' bites had a chance of rendering their targets unconscious for 1-10 minutes, allowing the creature to feed freely. Even though giant vampire bats were not [[undead]] themselves, the victims who perished from being drained by them had a chance of raising as undead 24 hours after their death.",
        "Behavior": "Most vampire bats fed exclusively on non-humanoid mammalian blood, however oftentimes their presence fuels panic and paranoia in fear of true [[vampire]]s.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Vampire bats were often spotted in the night skies over [[Waterdeep]] and in the vicinity of the [[Dragon Tower]] of the wizard [[Maaril]] in the 14{{th}}century [[DR]].\n\nOutside of [[Toril]], vampire bats could be found in the land of [[Barovia]] in the [[Domains of Dread]].{{Cite dungeon/207/Fair Barovia|69}}"

        "Notable Vampire Bats": "*[[Gothma]]: the fabled giant vampire bat of [[Gillian's Hill]] that many believed dwelt under the town's graveyard and was surrounded by its undead servants. The vampire bat was believed to be behind a plague of [[1372 DR]]."
