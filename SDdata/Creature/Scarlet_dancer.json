        "Description": "Scarlet dancers were smaller than crimson deaths and usually gathered in group of 10â€“100. They did not form [[humanoid]] likenesses when they gathered.",
        "Combat": "A cluster of scarlet dancers was able to sense warm-blooded creatures from up to {{SI|100|ft}} away. They drew blood from their victims with tentacles of red mist. Blood was drawn faster if more scarlet mists were grouped together. Scarlet dancers did get slower the more they fed, making them easier to strike.\n\nBecause they were partially mist, scarlet dancers were able to pass through metal and leather [[armor]] with ease.",
        "Society": "These creatures were only found in the sewers of Zhentil Keep. They inherently avoided sunlight, but it did them no harm. They fed on sewer rats and other small animals, and any larger creatures or humanoids foolish enough to venture into the sewers. [[Human]]s were their favorite food source and human blood was required for their reproduction.\n\nA cluster of scarlet dancers would perish if it went longer than three days without feeding.",
        "History": "Some [[sage]]s believed that scarlet dancers were immature versions of crimson deaths. The origins of these creatures was a mystery, but some believed them to be the result of [[Zhentarim]] experiments."
