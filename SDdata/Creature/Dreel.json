        "mainbody": "Dreels, or trollfingers, were river eel-like fish native to the River Reaching, particularly the area of the river between the Misty Stair waterfalls and Skull Gorge.\nSomewhere between green and black in color, dreels were relatively short and stocky.\nDreels subsisted on algae and carrion, which helped keep the river clean. They felt quite at home in the icy waters of the River Reaching.\nIn spite of their mucus-like taste, dreels were quite nourishing. Their taste improved considerably if served properly, for example fried or pickled with herbs and spices.\nIn the 1490s DR, the Cutlass inn in Luskan advertised a \"breakfast special\" consisting of brandy and dreels."
