An osquip was an aggressive, multi-legged rodent about the size of a small dog.
They were hairless, with huge heads and large teeth. Most had six legs, a few had eight, and even fewer had ten. Their tails were not uniform either. They varied between no tail at all, to a stump, to a rat tails length. Some claimed that their teeth were sharp enough to dig through stone.
While rats normally fled anything larger than themselves, osquips proved to be both territorial and willing to attack trespassers fearlessly and ferociously. If a party entered an area where osquips made their home, the creatures emerged quickly, and a typical swarm was very damaging.
Unlike rats, osquips were not afraid of fire.
Osquips had no understanding of value but collected shiny things from time to time.
Osquips used their aforementioned teeth to fight. They had a developed sense of scent and could pinpoint creatures within 5 feet (1.5 meters) and had a general sense of direction of creatures within 30 feet (9.1 meters).
Osquips built small, hidden tunnels. They had teeth that could be used to dig through rock. They were found either alone or in packs of two to sixteen specimens.
They were bad at swimming.
On Toril, osquips were sometimes used as familiars.
