'''Zakharan ogres'''Â were found throughout the [[Zakhara|Land of Fate]].

==Personality==
Unlike savage [[ogre]]s from other lands, Zakharan ogres interacted with the world in many of the same ways that [[human]]s, [[elf|elves]], or [[dwarf|dwarves]] did, though they did not have superior crafting skills.

==Society==
Zakharan ogres disliked magic and saw [[oni mage|ogre mages]] as secretive and sneaky. In their society, only pure breed ogres were seen as civilized, those with purple skin or mixed blood, like the [[ogrima]], were shunned. Zakharan ogres tended to distance themselves from the sinister reputation of the ogrima.
