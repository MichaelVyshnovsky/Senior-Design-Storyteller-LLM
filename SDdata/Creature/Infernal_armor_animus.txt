Infernal armor animuses, were souls bound to suits of armor by devils through an evil ritual.
An infernal armor animus might appear as general scrap or detritus until it was activated.
Despite their similarity to constructs, infernal armors were relatively (if not greatly) intelligent.

Infernal armor animuses empowered stronger devils near them with their aura of bloodlust, making their allies hit harder for each aura that enveloped them. Though weak, the destruction of their physical forms caused the soul within to burst free, only to be consumed by the nearest devil, healing them with the transference of essence.
Infernal armors were usually equipped with short swords and heavy shields, and hurled themselves into battle, flanking when possible. They were most effective when massed with more powerful devils and moved to stay near as many as possible to keep them in their aura.
Infernal armors may hold back initially, as being destroyed before others were harmed would be a waste of their abilities, or remained still until a certain subject was harmed, at which point they charged and attacked. As such, the best tactic when confronted with them was often to destroy them all before attacking other devils.

The tortured spirits within infernal armors provided a cache of life energy for devils and military support to their overlords.
In the late years of the 15 century DR, the Ashmadai cells of Neverwinter were known to make use of infernal armor.
