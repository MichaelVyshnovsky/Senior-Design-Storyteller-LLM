'''Infernal armor animuses''',{{cite dungeon/169/Stormcrow Tor|26-27}} were [[soul]]s bound to suits of [[armor]] by [[devil]]s through an evil ritual.

==Description==
An infernal armor animus might appear as general scrap or detritus until it was activated.{{cite dungeon/178/Coppernight's Salvation|65-66}}

==Behavior==
Despite their similarity to [[construct]]s, infernal armors were relatively (if not greatly) intelligent.

==Abilities==

Infernal armor animuses empowered stronger devils near them with their aura of bloodlust, making their allies hit harder for each aura that enveloped them. Though weak, the destruction of their physical forms caused the soul within to burst free, only to be consumed by the nearest devil, healing them with the transference of essence.

==Combat==
Infernal armors were usually equipped with [[short sword]]s and heavy [[shield]]s, and hurled themselves into battle, flanking when possible. They were most effective when massed with more powerful devils and moved to stay near as many as possible to keep them in their aura.

Infernal armors may hold back initially, as being destroyed before others were harmed would be a waste of their abilities, or remained still until a certain subject was harmed, at which point they charged and attacked. As such, the best tactic when confronted with them was often to destroy them all before attacking other devils.

==Society==

The tortured spirits within infernal armors provided a cache of life energy for devils and military support to their overlords.{{cite dungeon/179/The Den of Dreus|52}}

==History ==
In the late years of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Ashmadai]] cells of [[Neverwinter]] were known to make use of infernal armor.<ref>
