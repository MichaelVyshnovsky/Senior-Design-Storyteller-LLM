        "mainbody": "The Lhesperan was a refined breed of light horse that originated from the Shaaran town of Lhesper, but since spread across the greater country and into the Bandit Wastes.\nThese horses were medium-brown in color, with lighter-hued manes and tails. They were quite relaxed in their demeanor and elegant in their action.\nWhile the Lhesperans were first bred in their namesake city, they were since killed off in the town by yuan-ti. However, they were still plentiful in the surrounding areas."
