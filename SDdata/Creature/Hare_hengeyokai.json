        "mainbody": "Hare hengeyokai () or simply hares were a hare-based subrace of the hengeyokai, a race of intelligent natural shapechanging animals able to adopt hare, human, and hybrid forms. They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.\nIn human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form. For a hare hengeyokai, this might be wide brown eyes, and more subtly, lightning-quick reflexes.\nCompared to humans and the average hengeyokai, hares were slightly wiser but less strong, or they were more agile. They were adept in athletics skills.\nTheir tiny, quick animal forms were among the hardest to hit and they were the most swift-moving.\nOn the whole, hares were good-hearted. Like their namesake animals, they were peaceable by nature but easily surprised or frightened and they were quiet but alert for threats. They never consumed meat.\nSome hares worshiped the god of the warren.\nHares, along with carps, cranes, dogs, and monkeys, were more likely to become monks than other hengeyokai.\n* Notia Tong, a hare hengeyokai wu jen living in the Valley of Lo Chi in the mid–14 century DR.\n* Xax Chung, a hare hengeyokai bushi and the hero of Koje in Koryo in the mid–14 century DR."
