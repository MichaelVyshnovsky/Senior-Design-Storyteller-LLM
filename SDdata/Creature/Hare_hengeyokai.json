They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}}",
        "Description": "In human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form. For a hare hengeyokai, this might be wide brown eyes, and more subtly, lightning-quick reflexes.",
        "Abilities": "Compared to humans and the average hengeyokai, hares were slightly wiser but less strong, or they were more agile. They were adept in athletics skills.\n\nTheir tiny, quick animal forms were among the hardest to hit and they were the most swift-moving.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|7,8}}",
        "Personality": "On the whole, hares were good-hearted. Like their namesake animals, they were peaceable by nature but easily surprised or frightened and they were quiet but alert for threats. They never consumed meat.",
        "Society": "Some hares worshiped the [[god of the warren]].\n\nHares, along with [[carp hengeyokai|carps]], [[crane hengeyokai|cranes]], [[dog hengeyokai|dogs]], and [[monkey hengeyokai|monkeys]], were more likely to become [[monk]]s than other hengeyokai.",
