        "mainbody": "'''Giant crabs''' were a species of large [[crab]].",
        "Description": "Giant crabs were known to sport varying arrays of colors. Most commonly reds, browns, and greys. Their bodies were typically covered by a large, chitinous shell. Some species had their eyes atop stalks, allowing them to peak over ledges or around corners.",
        "Biology": "Giant crabs were amphibious creatures, equally capable of surviving on both land and in water.\n\nGiant crabs typically mated in [[Autumn Equinox|autumn]], with males attempting to mate with as many females as they could. The fertilized females were known to bury their eggs in the sand of beaches, which would then hatch the following [[Spring Equinox|spring]].",
        "Combat": "Giant crabs typically preferred to sneak up on their prey, then catch and dismember them with their large pincers.",
        "History": "Some time following its destruction on the [[Night of Burning Flowers]] in [[647 DR]], the castle of [[Ito-jo]] in [[Kozakura]] was haunted by the [[ghost]]s of giant crabs and these hauntings would continue well into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nAround the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], one could purchase a leg or whole body of a giant crab to dine upon at [[Sharkey's Bar & Grill]] near [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref>\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century DR, coven of [[sea hag]]s dwelling in the [[Sargauth Level]] of [[Undermountain]] used giant crabs as their mounts and pets.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Giant crabs were known to often feed upon large dead fish and other forms of carrion that sank beneath the waves or washed up on shores. Their tendency to feast upon large carrion along the seafloor was considered an important ecological niche. They were also known to venture into the water in search of fish.",
            "Habitats": "In [[northwest Faer√ªn]], giant crabs could be found in the [[Stump Bog]].{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}}\n\nIn the [[Zakhara]] region's [[Crowded Sea]], they could be found on the archipelago of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]]. Particularly in its bay [[Batihat al-Saji]] and the islands of [[Jazayir al-Alfar]] and [[Uyun al-Sartan]]. Those that inhabited the last island were known as \"the children of Sartan.\"",
            "Relationships": "Though difficult to train, some aquatic [[ranger]]s were known to have them as [[animal companion]]s.",
            "Usages": "On the surface, giant crabs were often hunted by [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s for their meat and hard chitinous shells. The latter of which were prized by some as a material for constructing [[chitin armor|armor]] and [[shield]]s.\n\nThe militia of the [[Haifami]] was one such group that wielded shields, fancifully-decorated, that were carved from the shells of giant crabs."
