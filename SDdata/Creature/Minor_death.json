        "Description": "Minor deaths appeared as robed [[skeleton]]s wielding [[scythe]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Minor deaths were immune to cold, electricity, and [[fire]]-based spells and abilities. They were also immune to the effects of charm, ''[[enchantment]]'', and ''[[sleep]]''-based spells.",
        "Combat": "Minor deaths fought with their scythes, attacking until either they or their target were defeated. A minor death could not be disarmed.",
        "Ecology": "Minor deaths could be summoned once per [[tenday]] by [[Myrkulyte]] [[specialty priest]]s known as [[Gray One]]s, If the conjured minor death were to be destroyed, the Gray One or Kelemvorite cleric who summoned it would be unable to summon another minor death until they had killed a living creature. Doomguides on the other hand, had to burn a special [[incense]] costing around 1,000 [[gp]] on a consecrated altar within a Kelemvorite temple.\n\nPulling the \"Skull\" card from a ''[[deck of many things]]'' could summon a minor death with the singular focus of killing the one who drew the card. If anyone tried to aid in the individual's fight, another minor death would be conjured to fight them. Unlike the minor deaths that were summoned through [[divine magic]], any creature killed by the minor death of a ''deck of many things'' could not be raised from the dead by any means."
