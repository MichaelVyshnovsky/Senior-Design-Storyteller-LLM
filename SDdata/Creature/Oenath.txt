Oenath, also known as Dreamers, were intelligent, wolf-like creatures living in the wilds of Akanûl. They were originally a pack of wolves changed by the Spellplague into their current form.
Oenath hunted in packs. Their roar has the ability to knock an opponent over at close range.	
Oenath had thin gray fur and white skin. Their faces often looked nearly humanoid.
