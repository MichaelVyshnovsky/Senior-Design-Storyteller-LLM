Rift dragons were a variety of eel-like fish found near thermal vents in the Sea of Moving Ice.
By the 15 century DR, rift dragons were known to have been around on Toril since ancient times. Though naturalists still had yet to determine if these creatures were truly draconic in nature, as live specimens were hard to obtain.
Rift dragons were so feared by fishermen of the Sea of Moving Ice, they would quickly cut their line whenever they felt they might have hooked one.
