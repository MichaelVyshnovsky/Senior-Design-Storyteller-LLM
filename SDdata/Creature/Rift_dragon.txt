'''Rift dragons''' were a variety of [[eel]]-like [[fish]] found near thermal vents in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

==History==
By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], rift dragons were known to have been around on [[Toril]] since ancient times. Though naturalists still had yet to determine if these creatures were truly [[Dragonkind|draconic]] in nature, as live specimens were hard to obtain.

==Reputation==
Rift dragons were so feared by fishermen of the Sea of Moving Ice, they would quickly cut their line whenever they felt they might have hooked one.
