        "mainbody": "ed wolves of Payit were a species of wolves or wolf-like creatures native to the continent of Maztica, lands surrounding the town of Helmsport.\nRed wolves of Payit resembled dire wolves of Faerûn but were slightly smaller in size and had reddish fur. Those who faced red wolves in battle said that the creatures eyes gleamed with malevolent intelligence. This unsettling gleam remained present even after the creature was stuffed and preserved for display.\nThese creatures demonstrated remarkable cunning, and it led to speculations that red wolves of Payit were cross-breeds of wolves and foxes. However, there were no known crossbreeds between the two species, the fact that led to sages to believe red wolves were a completely separate species.\nRed wolves of Payit were first encountered by Amnian explorers in the Maztican nation of Payit when the continent was being \"discovered\", following the armed conflict of 1361 DR and 1362 DR.\nRed wolves became a major threat to the settlers of Helmsport. Regular attacks took the lives of over a dozen builders, leading the colonial authorities to assemble a group to hunt down and kill the leader of the pack. The hunters succeeded, and the dead red wolf pack leader was stuffed and proudly displayed in Helmsports Temple of Helm. The stuffed creature became known as the Red Wolf of Payit. The stuffing and display enraged the locals, who thought it to be disrespectful to the beast.\nThe killing of the pack leader stopped the red wolves attacks on Helmsport. However, soon after, a chain of maladies afflicted the temples inhabitants. Local Payits believed that the Red Wolfs spirit was haunting the temple, exacting revenge on its killers. Helmites and settlers considered it to be nothing but superstition. Their opinions started to waver after the temples High Priest perished of a heartstop by the stuffed Red Wolf of Payit. After some unrest, the stuffed animal was removed and sent to Amn to calm the superstitious.\nThe Curse of the Red Wolf persisted, taking the lives of several owners of the stuffed beast in Amn. All were Helmites, and all died under mysterious circumstances. By the , the infamous stuffed wolf was accepted by planeswalking wizard of Westgate, Mintassan the Magnificent and displayed in his curio shop – Mintassans Mysteries."
