'''Greater medusae''' were a breed of [[medusa]]e with a massive serpentine tail instead of [[humanoid]] legs and torso.

==Description==
Greater medusae were quite rare, being born at only one in ten births. Like their more common kin, they had heads of living [[snake]]s and bodies covered in fine scales, but instead of a woman's lower body, they had snake tails. A greater medusa stood between {{SI|6'|'"|long=yes}} and {{SI|7'|'"|long=yes}} tall with a tail that could reach from {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} to {{SI|20'|'"|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Greater medusae were solitary creatures, rarely venturing far from their lairs. Most of them had a malicious nature, however, there were some odd exceptionsâ€”individuals who lacked an evil streak and preferred the studious lives of a [[mage]]-researcher and a vintner.

==Abilities==
Like a regular medusa, greater medusae could turn living creatures to stone with a mere glance at the range of {{SI|30'|'"|long=yes}} with their ''[[petrify]]ing'' gaze reaching into the [[Ethereal Plane]] as well as the [[Astral Plane]], and their serpentine hair could launch [[poison|venomous]] bites at opponents within {{SI|1'|'"|long=yes}}. One important distinction from their mundane kin was poisonous blood. Greater medusae's poisonous blood was so potent that even touching a dead creature was a deadly endeavor.{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|27}} Additionally, greater medusae had limited resistance to magic.

==Ecology==
A rare type of crossbreed was known to be possible, spawned from a greater medusa and a [[yuan-ti abomination]].{{Cite dungeon/37/Serpents of the Sands|17}}
