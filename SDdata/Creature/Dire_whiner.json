        "mainbody": "ire whiners were rare demons that preyed on other creatures using magically enhanced insults.\nDire whiners resembled large, ugly women, typically covered in dirt and slime.\nDire whiners were thoroughly evil creatures that had no care or regard for anyone other than themselves.\nDire whiners were highly intelligent and had three forms of magical speaking. The first ability, whine acted similarly to a suggestion spell. The second ability, complain, functioned like a feeblemind spell, and the third ability, put-down, had the effects of symbol of hopelessness. Dire whiners could use these abilities one at a time and at will simply by speaking. Each ability effected all creatures within earshot\nDire whiners preferred not to fight, instead using their words to prey on other creatures. They used whine to get other creatures to bring them food and treasure, complain against magic-users that were potential enemies, and put-down to break other creatures wills so that she could more easily enslave them.\nDire whiners typically lived in swamps in the Abyss and enslaved other demons, mephits, and other creatures of their area to collect food and other necessities."
