        "mainbody": "'''Dire whiners''' were rare [[demon]]s that preyed on other creatures using magically enhanced insults.",
        "Description": "Dire whiners resembled large, ugly women, typically covered in dirt and slime.",
        "Personality": "Dire whiners were thoroughly evil creatures that had no care or regard for anyone other than themselves.",
        "Abilities": "Dire whiners were highly intelligent and had three forms of magical speaking. The first ability, ''whine'' acted similarly to a ''[[suggestion]]'' spell. The second ability, ''complain'', functioned like a ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell, and the third ability, ''put-down'', had the effects of ''[[symbol of hopelessness]]''. Dire whiners could use these abilities one at a time and at will simply by speaking. Each ability effected all creatures within earshot",
        "Combat": "Dire whiners preferred not to fight, instead using their words to prey on other creatures. They used ''whine'' to get other creatures to bring them food and treasure, ''complain'' against magic-users that were potential enemies, and ''put-down'' to break other creature's wills so that she could more easily enslave them.",
        "Ecology": "Dire whiners typically lived in swamps in the [[Abyss]] and enslaved other demons, [[mephit]]s, and other creatures of their area to collect food and other necessities."
