'''Rhaumbusuns''' were reptilian creatures with a dangerous paralyzing gaze in the steppes of the [[Hordelands]], and in [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
A rhaumbusun's relation to the dreaded [[basilisk]] was evident by its eight legs, reptilian appearance, and dorsal spikes. The species had distinct sexual dimorphism: males had glittering scales of purple hue, while females' scales were mostly orange. Otherwise, both sexes were born with a dirty orange coloration that changed as they matured and they were of approximately equal size. The most notable feature of rhaumbusuns was their clear multi-faceted eyes that resembled [[gemstone]]s. An adult's tail reached {{SI|1'|'"|long=yes}}, while its total length was {{SI|2'|'"|long=yes}} to {{SI|2'5|'"|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
When agitated, rhaumbusuns' tails began to flip sideways sharply. They were loudly shuffling and clumsy creatures with short stubby legs that curled inwards under their bodies. They moved in a loud scuttle, making them quite easy to detect even if visually concealed.

==Combat==
The paralyzing gaze was its main weapon and defense mechanism—the target needed to meet the creature's stare to be affected. A rhaumbusun's magical gaze reached {{SI|20'|'"|long=yes}} and could affect one creature per minute. The paralyzation lasted for one to eight minutes. Unlike some other creatures with magical sight, a rhaumbusun's gaze could not be reflected with [[mirror]]s, though the spell of ''[[gaze reflection]]'' could turn the paralyzing magic against itself. However, all rhaumbusuns were immune to each others' gazes. Also, unlike many other magical gazes, a rhaumbusun's sight did not affect the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] or [[Ethereal plane]]s. Rhaumbusuns attacked with a bite when cornered and preferred to target creatures made helpless with the paralyzing stare.

==Ecology==
Apprehensive creatures by nature, rhaumbusuns fed on plant matter, preferring [[fireweed]], [[spruce]] buds, bark, and [[nut]]s. However, owing to their magical gaze, they became accidental predators. The areas around their lair were often notable by the paralyzed beasts that eventually became prey to actual predators in the area. Some smaller creatures even chose to lair within rhaumbusun territory for the protection the reptiles offered.

Rhaumbusuns were most commonly encountered in mated pairs, and they mated for life. The creatures mated in late spring, and each couple produced a single egg that hatched 41–48 days later. The young was weak initially but reached the size of an adult within 20 days. The parents and their young defended each other to the death when endangered. Parents defended their young with ferocity while the entire family defended their lairs. If one of a pair died or was separated from its partner, rhaumbusuns mourned the loss and physically deteriorated during the period. Typical mourning took one to four weeks, and the deterioration could be fatal for the grieving creature.

A typical rhaumbusun lair was a small hidden, dark, and dry cave. These reptiles often decorated their lairs with small shiny baubles, usually worthless with occasional pieces of precious metals, [[coin]]s, and rarely [[gem]]s.

Rhaumbusuns communicated in their own rudimentary language consisting of clicks and hisses. Timid by nature, they willingly communicated with [[humanoid]]s who learned the language or via the ''[[speak with monster]]'' spell.

===Habitats===
In the [[Hordelands]], rhaumbusuns inhabited the Central Steppe of the Endless Wastes as well as the [[Quoya]] desert.

[[Maztica]]n rhaumbusuns inhabited the scrublands of [[Metahel]], the [[Pasocada Basin]], and dry lands around the [[Valley of Nexal]].

[[Zakhara]]n deserts and

Beyond [[Toril]], rhaumbusuns scuttled across the desert of the world of [[Athas]].{{Cite book| author = Troy Denning & Timothy B.Brown| title = Dark Sun (Boxed Set)| short_story = | date = 1991| editor = | publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = 1560761040| pages = 76| chapter = }}<ref>{{Cite dragon/173/The Monstrous Side of the Dark Sun World|11}}

===Usages===
Rhaumbusuns were hunted for their glittering hides, which were popular as decoration for small items. The reptiles' eyes were a valuable commodity if undamaged and preserved, going for 200 [[gold]] pieces per orb. [[Wizard]]s and alchemists used their eyes to prepare [[ink]] for scribing [[scroll]]s of ''[[paralyzation]]'' and [[potion]]s of the same effect.

Domesticated rhaumbusuns were known to be kept by powerful [[cleric]]s and wizards as pets or guardians. A living pair of these creatures was sold for 2,000 gold coins and eggs for 500 gold each.
