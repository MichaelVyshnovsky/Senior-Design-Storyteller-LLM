        "History": "During the years of [[Spellplague]], elemental weevils could be found on the slopes of [[Mount Hotenow]]. Following the mount's [[Ruining|volcanic explosion]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the tiny ember creatures could be found within [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]]. During that time, [[Riftel Farsight]] was researching the creatures, sending her apprentice [[Gerad Kinesward]] into the [[orc]]-ravaged district to collect the insects for her."
