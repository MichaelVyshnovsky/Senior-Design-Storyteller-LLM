        "mainbody": "'''Alhoons''' were magic-using outcasts from [[mind flayer]] societies who had defied the ruling [[elder brain]]s to achieve a limited form of [[lich]]dom. Only the most powerful mind flayer mages could achieve true lichdom and were known as '''illithiliches''';\n\n{{quote|''An undead mind flayer. Horrible creatures with heads that look like an octopus. Between their psionic powers and wizard spells they're deadly opponents.''|[[Jarial]] the [[Sorcerer]]}}",
        "Description": "Alhoons looked as they had in life except that their skin possessed none of the wet, smooth, slimy texture of living illithids, instead, appearing dry, wrinkled, and cracked as a result of the powerful magic resistance that had prevented a perfect conversion to lichdom. They had to work hard to keep their skin hydrated&mdash;such as by taking frequent baths or by consuming liquids&mdash;or else it would begin to desiccate.\n\nThey detested&mdash;but were not generally harmed by&mdash;bright lights, extreme temperatures, and lack of food.",
        "Combat": "Many Alhoons had been [[wizard]]s or [[sorcerer]]s in life, and thus combined these abilities with their innate skill at [[psionics]] and the formidable resilience of a lich to become truly dangerous beings. In close quarters, they used their tentacles to target the heads&mdash;and brains&mdash;of their foes. As [[undead]] creatures, they were highly resilient, and further were quite resistant to most anti-undead magics, such as ''[[Turn undead|turning]]''. However, most did not enjoy the full range of powers possessed by a true lich.\n\nAlhoons favored the use of ''[[Wand|wands]]'' in combat, and often carried at least one [[magic item]].",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Although alhoons did not need to drink or eat, they did often consume liquids and foods, both to keep hydrated and for pleasure. Liquids were ingested without regard to either their nutrition content or [[poison|toxicity]]. For food, they devoured brains as did living mind flayers&mdash;granting them flashes of insight into memories of the brain's former owner&mdash;and developed a taste for eating slugs, [[leech]]es, and worms (in particular, they enjoyed glow-worms).",
            "Relationships": "Alhoons in the Underdark were known to band together into closely knit and interdependent communities in order to counter the threats of their enemies, including [[drow]], [[duergar]], [[aboleth]]s, [[cloaker]]s, [[beholders]], true liches, and living illithids. While more than capable of forming alliances with other creatures, alhoons were incapable of viewing the living as more than livestock. Alhoons on the surface were generally solitary, and would often seek out isolated wizard towers to slay the occupants and claim them as their own."

        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, the Netherese sorcerer-king [[Ioulaum]] disappeared from [[Netheril]] as the [[phaerimm]]s' ''lifedrain'' spells were causing his life-sustaining magic, ''[[Ioulaum's longevity]]'', to fail. Ioulaum embraced lichdom and established a lair in the depths of the [[Northdark]], and the first illithiliches (who referred to themselves as the Alhoon) were believed to have been his students recruited from the nearby mind flayer city of [[Ellyn'taal]]. Ioulaum’s intentions for recruiting mind flayer students became clear when he created an undead elder brain from the minds of his illithid students and then merged his own sentience into it. Most of his illithilich apprentices were destroyed in the ritual, and Ioulaum's last [[human]] apprentice, [[Tabra]], mistook this violence as a battle in which the mind flayer students had betrayed their master and murdered him. To avenge her master, she cast the now perfected ''Ioulaum's longevity'' on herself and slaughtered the last few of remaining mind flayers of Ellyn’taal. However, a few of the illithiliches escaped and spread the secret of illithilich creation to mind flayer communities throughout the Realms Below.\n\nAround the same time as the beginning of the [[Retreat]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, alhoons began infiltrating the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] seeking magic items and [[spellbook]]s. They used their powers to turn other denizens of the ruins against each other&mdash;notably the phaerimm and the [[baatezu]]&mdash;while they hid and searched. Over the next 25 years, approximately forty alhoon would arrive in Myth Drannor, and they enlisted the aid of [[nagas]], [[deepspawn]], [[gargoyle]]s, and any newly arrived [[adventurer]]s to continue distracting their rivals in the area.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the alhoon were becoming a force with which to be reckoned across the Underdark as they gained control of communities of mind flayers, beholders, and [[Vhaeraun]]ite drow. Rumors abounded in cities like [[Menzoberranzan]] that their spies were everywhere, and preemtive measures were taken should the alhoon begin mental intrusions into the drow power structures. On the surface, they had begun to infiltrate the [[Dalelands]] by capturing seculded wizard towers.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1369}}, the alhoon who dwelt within the ruined Myth Drannor and its [[Dwarven Dungeons]] were driven out by members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their [[red dragon]] [[dracolich]] ally, [[Pelendralaar]].. In the same year, alhoons were known to have taken up residence in the abandoned [[drow]] city of [[Telnarquel]].",
