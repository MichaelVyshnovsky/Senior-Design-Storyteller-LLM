'''Zin-carla''', "spirit-wraith" in the [[Drow language]], was a special type of [[undead]] created through a ritual performed by [[arachne]]. [[Lolth]] only granted the zin-carla ritual for specific tasks, which may never be purely to work revenge or bring harm on other [[drow]]. Failure brought the disfavor of Lolth. Zin-carla was, literally, the restoration of a spirit to that spirit's deceased body.  For all intents and purposes, the spirit-wraith was the same as it was before death; however, the thing's free will was repressed, and under the control of a matron mother.<ref>
