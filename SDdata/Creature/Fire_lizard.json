        "mainbody": "'''Fire lizards''', also known as '''false dragons''', were a very rare and gargantuan species of lizard.",
        "Description": "The alternative name of these creatures was derived from the fact that they closely resembled [[red dragon]]s, though lacked wings. Their bodies were covered in grey scales, with reddish undersides and mottlings of reddish-brown on their the back. Hatchlings had light grey scales and as they aged their scales grew darker in color.\n\nFire lizards typically moved at a slow pace and had an average lifespan of 50 to 100 years.",
        "Behavior": "Fire lizards had an animalistic level of intelligence and were attracted to shiny objects. Because of this they shared [[dragonkind]]s' habit of hoarding things in their lair, particularly [[gem]]s and metals.",
        "Abilities": "Fire lizards could breath a puff of [[fire]] from their mouths, much like a red dragon though not as large. This puff of fire generally reached to about {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}}. Their bodies were also impervious to harm from fire.\n\n[[Dracolich]]es were capable of possessing the corpses of fire lizards.",
        "Combat": "Besides their fire breath, these creatures generally attacked with their claws or by biting.",
        "History": "Among scholars who championed the [[proto-dragon]] theory, sages speculated that these reptiles may have been one of the many ancestral species to dragonkind or an evolutionary offshoot of a common ancestor.\n\nDuring the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some fire lizards were known to dwell inside the depths of [[Undermountain]]. In [[1369 DR]], one these creatures specifically dwelled within the layer of Undermountain known as the [[Crystal Labyrinth]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Fire lizards were a carnivorous species. They would leave their lairs to hunt for prey once every two weeks, taking whatever game they catched back to their lair.",
            "Lairs": "These creatures generally made their lairs underground.",
            "Habitats": "Fire lizards were very adaptable, able to live in most forms of terrain, though they were only ever encountered in warm climates.{{Cite dragon/54/Ruins|11}} On [[Toril]] they were known to be found in the [[Fire Marsh]]es of [[High Moor]].\n\nOutside of the [[Prime Material plane]], fire lizards inhabited the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]'s [[plane]] of [[Qui]].",
            "Relationships": "True dragons generally avoided interacting with fire lizards, especially red dragons.\n\nThey were sometimes domesticated by [[firenewt]]s, who used them to guard the hatching grounds of their lairs.",
            "Usage": "Fire lizard eggs could fetch prices of up to around 5,000 [[gold piece]]s A practice that was typically done by [[cleric]]s of [[Ibrandul]].\n\nSome were known to harvest the blood of these creatures for use in the creation of ''[[potion of fire resistance|potions of fire resistance]]''."
