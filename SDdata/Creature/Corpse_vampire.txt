'''Corpse vampires''', also known as '''pouncing vampires''' by [[halfling]]s, were a type of [[vampire]] that emerged in the Realms following the [[Spellplague]]. The corpse of a [[humanoid]] could potentially arise as one of these if they were buried improperly, left in a place that was polluted by [[evil]] energies, or were robbed of their burial possessions.

==Description==
Corpse vampires had pale skin, slowly decaying forms, and a feral appearance. They were rather slow moving, except when pouncing around.

==Personality==
Corpse vampires retained the memories of their former life. They often sought to victimize the friends and relatives they had in life.

==Abilities==
Like most vampires, these creatures possessed an immunity to [[disease]]s and [[poison]]s, they could see in areas of [[darkvision|total darkness]], and they could drain the blood of their victims.

Any humanoid that died from having their blood drained from them by a corpse vampire would arise as one themselves on the following day's sunset. Though if a humanoid died from a corpse vampire by any other means, they would instead arise as a [[zombie]]. These transformations could be prevented by reviving those slain, or otherwise by burning or decapitating their bodies.

==Combat==
Besides their fangs, corpse vampires fought with sharp claws. They typically leaped upon their prey, most often doing so from a higher vantage point.

==Society==
Unlike some vampires, corpse vampires did not rest within [[coffin]]s during daylight hours. They would instead burrow into loose soil and take a rest under the earth.
===Homelands===
In the [[Shadowfell]], corpse vampires could be found in [[Evernight]] and the [[Burning Woods]], that [[plane]]'s reflections of [[Neverwinter]] and the [[Neverwinter Wood]]s respectively.<ref>

===Languages===
Corpse vampires spoke in bestial tones, often in the [[Common]] language.
===Relationships===
Corpse vampires frequently went hunting with other forms of [[undead]] or other nocturnal creatures.
