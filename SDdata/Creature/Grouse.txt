A species of ruffed grouse inhabited the [[Border Kingdoms]] region.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Ecology==
Birds like grouse were prey to predators such as [[giant lynx]].

===Habitats===
*Just outside the eastern walls of [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, was located a large area of tall fragrant grass and wildflowers—a popular hunting ground for those looking for birds like grouse or [[pheasant]].
*In the wider [[Sword Coast]], grouse, bustards, [[rock dove]]s, and many other seabirds were a common sight.
*In the [[Interior Faerûn]], grouse inhabited the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]].
*The neighboring [[Dalelands]] were home to blusterwing, namely [[Deepingdale]], in the vicinity of the [[Wineflow]] and [[Glaemril]], and [[Glaun]] in the [[Dun Hills]].
*Wetlands such as the [[High Moor]] were inhabited by blusterwing and similar game bird-[[flunderwing]]s,
*In [[Turmish]], grouse, pheasants, [[duck]]s were given carefully selected areas of land for nesting in order to control the region's game population.
*The [[Moonshae Isles]] were home to a significant blusterwing population.

===Usages===
*[[Elf]] nobility of the ancient city [[Myth Drannor]] partook of [[mint]] water paired with cold [[grouse pie]].
*Simple spit-roasted birds were sold in the city of [[Arabel]] in Cormyr.
