        "mainbody": "'''Sand fleas''' were tiny parasitic [[insect]]s that caused extreme discomfort to creatures they infested.",
        "Ecology": "Sand fleas inhabited sandy beaches. An infestation of these insects often was treated as a highly infectious disease. Their bites and movements caused host creatures extreme itching and discomfort. These tiny insects caused misery and discomfort, preventing the host from resting and healing normally, causing them to become irritable and distracted. Sand fleas could jump great distances, allowing the infestation to spread quickly from one host to another.\n\nSand flea infestation could be summoned via the ''[[infestation]]'' spell."
