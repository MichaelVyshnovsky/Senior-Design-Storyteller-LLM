        "mainbody": "'''Singing trees''' were bizarre plant-like sanguivores (blood-feeders) found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.",
        "Description": "Singing trees looked like regular deciduous trees, but had unique leaves. Each leaf sang with a beautiful high-pitched voice, combining together to form an irresistible orchestra. If hungry enough, the body of the tree joined the song with a bass voice.",
        "Biology": "A singing tree only produced one seed every five years. When this occurred, the parent tree sent the seed flying away on the breeze with a pair of leaves, ensuring it landed far enough away so that it did not encroach on the parent tree's territory. Saplings attempting to plant within another singing tree's territory were not taken lightly. The dominant tree would send leaves to block the sun from reaching the sapling or to attack the sapling's leaves directly. Singing trees could live for centuries if given an ample food supply.",
        "Combat": "Singing trees used their bass voice to lure animals within hearing distance. The song compelled most animals to approach the tree for a rest, at which point the tree would drop several leaves on the animal to feed. Feeding leaves fell from the tree in a natural manner. Charmed animals did not even feel the small prick of the leaf's stem as it broke their skin and drew blood. After consuming a bit of blood, the leaf would float back to the tree and attach itself.\n\nIf a singing tree was attacked directly, it would send a swarm of leaves at the attacker, draining blood and temporarily blinding them.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Singing trees were a carnivorous species of plant. When in a state of starvation their intense hunger made them feral, causing a tree to lash out at any warm-blooded creature that entered their territory.",
            "Habitats": "Singing trees grew within forests of a temperate or warm climate. They were usually found far from humans in secluded areas, generally in the land of Zakhara, and at least one stood on the [[Malatran Plateau]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/The Soulless Shu|7}}",
            "Relationships": "These trees had a symbiotic relationship with [[talking bird]]s. They attracted other animals that the birds would feed upon and in turn the birds would feed off a tree's leaves as well as any pests infecting it.\n\nSome creatures were known to keep singing trees in a state of starvation so that they could act as fierce guardians.\n\nSinging trees were a [[favored plant]] of the [[deities]] [[Rillifane Rallathil]], [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], and [[Sheela Peryroyl]]."

        "Notable Singing Trees": "* An ancient and powerful singing tree inhabited the [[Public Gardens of Huzuz]]. It was known to spread its leaves across the entire area, filling the garden with beautiful music.{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|14}}\n* [[Tendor]], a singing tree that stood in the [[Rayana Savanna]] on the Malatran Plateau around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
