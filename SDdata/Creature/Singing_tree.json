        "mainbody": "Singing trees were bizarre plant-like sanguivores (blood-feeders) found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nSinging trees looked like regular deciduous trees, but had unique leaves. Each leaf sang with a beautiful high-pitched voice, combining together to form an irresistible orchestra. If hungry enough, the body of the tree joined the song with a bass voice.\nA singing tree only produced one seed every five years. When this occurred, the parent tree sent the seed flying away on the breeze with a pair of leaves, ensuring it landed far enough away so that it did not encroach on the parent trees territory. Saplings attempting to plant within another singing trees territory were not taken lightly. The dominant tree would send leaves to block the sun from reaching the sapling or to attack the saplings leaves directly. Singing trees could live for centuries if given an ample food supply.\nSinging trees used their bass voice to lure animals within hearing distance. The song compelled most animals to approach the tree for a rest, at which point the tree would drop several leaves on the animal to feed. Feeding leaves fell from the tree in a natural manner. Charmed animals did not even feel the small prick of the leafs stem as it broke their skin and drew blood. After consuming a bit of blood, the leaf would float back to the tree and attach itself.\nIf a singing tree was attacked directly, it would send a swarm of leaves at the attacker, draining blood and temporarily blinding them.\nSome brave individuals attempted to transport or cultivate singing trees within civilized lands. This was possible with an adult tree so long as the roots were not disturbed and the tree was not subjected to drastic temperature changes.\nFresh seeds could also be used to grow a new singing tree within a city, though these seeds sold for 5,000 gold pieces each.\nSinging trees were a carnivorous species of plant. When in a state of starvation their intense hunger made them feral, causing a tree to lash out at any warm-blooded creature that entered their territory.\nSinging trees grew within forests of a temperate or warm climate. They were usually found far from humans in secluded areas, generally in the land of Zakhara, and at least one stood on the Malatran Plateau.\nThese trees had a symbiotic relationship with talking birds. They attracted other animals that the birds would feed upon and in turn the birds would feed off a trees leaves as well as any pests infecting it.\nSome creatures were known to keep singing trees in a state of starvation so that they could act as fierce guardians.\nSinging trees were a favored plant of the deities Rillifane Rallathil, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Sheela Peryroyl.\n* An ancient and powerful singing tree inhabited the Public Gardens of Huzuz. It was known to spread its leaves across the entire area, filling the garden with beautiful music.\n* Tendor, a singing tree that stood in the Rayana Savanna on the Malatran Plateau around the 14 century DR."
