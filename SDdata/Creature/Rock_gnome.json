        "mainbody": "'''Rock gnomes''' were a curious, childlike race very much unlike their cousins, the [[deep gnome|svirfneblin]] (or deep gnomes) and the [[forest gnome]]s. When most people thought of [[gnome]]s, they were thinking of the rock gnome. Rock gnomes embodied the characteristics of their creator and patron deity, [[Garl Glittergold]], choosing to spend their long lives by filling each day with as much fun and enjoyment as possible.",
        "Description": "Rock gnomes were typically between 3 to 3½ ft (0.91‒1.1 m) tall and weighed anywhere from 40 to 45 lb (18‒20 kg). They possessed a natural brownish tint to their skin; the presence or absence of light had little effect upon it. Young rock gnomes possessed any of a large number of hair colors that faded to gray or white upon reaching adulthood. Male gnomes typically kept beards groomed in a neat manner.",
        "Personality": "Rock gnomes possessed many of the traits of other races, particularly [[human]]s, attributed to children. Most rock gnomes enjoyed life to their very fullest; asking questions endlessly, playing pranks on friends and strangers, and finding new and interesting hobbies were just a few of the countless chores that rock gnomes burdened each day with. Much like a child, a rock gnome possessed very little tolerance for long term mental focus unless the task at hand was of notable interest.\n\nWhile their joyful, child-like viewpoint of life gave the impression that a rock gnome would be incapable of achieving something as mundane as physical labor, rock gnomes managed to use their keen intelligence to turn something as generally unexciting as work into a fun and enjoyable expenditure of their time and energy.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Rock gnomes typically possessed a nonchalant reverence of their chosen deity, bringing up the name of their god in any form of conversation as if they were referring to a friend. Rock gnomes rarely went to church and had no particularly great amount of zeal towards the worship of their [[Gnome pantheon|pantheon]] of gods. In typical gnomish manner, the gnomish gods required no particularly impressive display of faith, being more interested in following their own admittedly mundane agendas.\n\nMost rock gnomes worshiped the head of the gnomish pantheon, [[Garl Glittergold]], considering him to be the idealized gnome, personifying mischief and merry-making.",
            "Relations with other races": "Rock gnomes were especially easy going with [[dwarves]] and [[halfling]]s, especially those who appreciated a good joke. They were typically more cautious and subdued around the Big Folk ([[human]]s, [[elves]] and the other medium size [[humanoid]]s), taking a considerably longer time (a day longer, perhaps) to consider them a friend and ally. They considered all forms of [[goblinkin]] to be extremely untrustworthy and gave them a very wide berth if possible.\n[[File:Clockworkbeholder.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''A rock gnome working on a clockwork [[beholder]].'']]",
            "Homelands": "Rock gnomes roamed the lands of [[Faerûn]] far and wide, using their impressive natural intelligence as inventors, mages, and other positions which required mechanical aptitude or just sheer knowledge of their surroundings. Rock gnomes who chose to study the paths of arcane magic typically chose the school of [[illusion]], which they often used to enhance storytelling or defending their small villages from [[goblinoid]] attack. Rock gnomes were also found commonly in the [[Western Heartlands]], the [[Dalelands]], and the woodlands between the [[Great Dale]] and [[Thesk]].\n\nThough unknown to most-every civilization of [[Toril]], rock gnomes additionally inhabited and ruled a secret realm below the [[Sunrise Mountains]] known as [[Songfarla|Songfarla the Hidden Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste}}"
