A '''werejackal''' was a [[lycanthrope]] that could assume the form of both a [[humanoid]] and a [[jackal]]. They were the opposite of the common [[antherion]]s, [[jackalwere]]s.{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Three}}

==Descriptions==
Werejackals were allergic to [[fennel]].

==Society==
These lycanthropes were actively hunted by the [[Silver Stake]], an anti-lycanthrope organization. They managed to develop [[Silver Stake gas bombs|gas bombs]] to make lycanthropes such as werejackals easier to capture. In order to create a bomb designed specifically for werejackals, they must have included both [[copper]] and fennel.
==Ecology==
===Uses===
Werejackal blood was an ingredient in some ''[[potion of sleep|potions of sleep]]''.
