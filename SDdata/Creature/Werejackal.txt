A werejackal was a lycanthrope that could assume the form of both a humanoid and a jackal. They were the opposite of the common antherions, jackalweres.
Werejackals were allergic to fennel.
These lycanthropes were actively hunted by the Silver Stake, an anti-lycanthrope organization. They managed to develop gas bombs to make lycanthropes such as werejackals easier to capture. In order to create a bomb designed specifically for werejackals, they must have included both copper and fennel.
Werejackal blood was an ingredient in some potions of sleep.
