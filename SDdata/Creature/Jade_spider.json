        "Description": "Jade spiders looked like a 15 ft (4.5 m) high, smoothly-sculpted [[spider]] statue that was capable of fluid movement. 20 ft (6 m) diameter and 5ft (1.5 m) high versions existed too, those weighed 45,000 lb (20.000 kg).\n\nThe spiders got their name because of the sharp-tipped mandibles and saw-edged legs which were made of a particular sort of magically-treated jade.\n\n[[Umber hulk]]s did not willingly approach jade spiders within 60 ft (18 m). To be more precise, they did not approach the magically-treated jade, as it was not just nauseating to umber hulks but also dangerous, since it corroded their hides.",
        "Abilities": "Jade spiders were mindless and therefore fearless. For example, fulfilling self-destructive orders was something they always did as ordered.\n\nThey fought by slashing their enemies with their legs and biting. Both attacks were dangerous for the former caused bleeding wounds that did not stop bleeding without magical or professional application of mundane medical skills. The latter was in a sense even more dangerous for it could cause the petrification of those bitten by the jade spider.\n\nTheir abilities to resist magical effects was dependent on the strength of the [[wizard]] who created the jade spider. They were completely immune to the [[spell]] ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' and differed in this point from other stone [[construct]]s like [[stone golem]]s. They had a strong resistance against non-magical attacks, but while they were not turned into a creature of different composition with a ''[[stone to flesh]]'' spell, they lost said resistance for 6 seconds if exposed to that spell.\n\nA jade spider also had magical abilities. First, it could detect creatures as though under a ''[[see invisibility]]'' spell and it could throw green-glowing, magical webs made of energy up to eight times per day. Being caught by these webs was like being caught by a ''[[forcecage]]'' spell.\n\nAs a general rule, jade spiders had a series of routine commands programmed into them. There were rumors about devices that could take control over a jade spider in battle.",
        "Ecology": "Jade spiders were created by [[drow]] wizards. They were used to protect locations, such as city gates, temples, vaults, or noble residents.\n\nOnly the oldest and most physically weak drow wizards were completely inducted in the secret of the creation of jade spiders. While there were many of those, their communities did their best to keep the secret from spilling out. For example, written records of how to create the jade spiders were stayed in the academies for wizards or noble households of said wizards until they died or became [[lich]]es.",
        "History": "As mentioned above, there were always rumors that devices existed that could hijack the control over jade spiders.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Tier Breche]] was guarded by two 15 ft tall jade spiders.\n\nDrow ships in [[wildspace]] each carried from four to twenty-four jade spiders to use against their primary enemy in wildspace, the [[neogi]], because of the jade spiders' demoralizing effects on the neogi's favored slaves, the umber hulks (see \"Description\" section above)."
