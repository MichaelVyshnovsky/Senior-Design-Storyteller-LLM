        "mainbody": "'''Golden ammonites''' were mysterious creatures who dwelt in the deepest parts of the ocean.",
        "Description": "Golden ammonites were large mollusks with a brilliant gold shell. Their body within the shell, like all mollusks, was soft and vulnerable, and dark brown in color. They had two large eyes on flexible stalks and several flexible tentacles, each up to {{SI|12|ft}} in length. Both the eye stalks and tentacles were hidden within the shell when not in use.",
        "Abilities": "Golden ammonites were nearsighted but were capable of detecting heat and light sources up to {{SI|120|ft}} away. It was capable of detecting motion and sounds in a radius of {{SI|600|ft}}, making it extremely difficult to surprise or sneak up on the mollusk. It was immune to charm, enchantment, psionic and telepathic-based effects and spells.\n\nFrom their eyes, a golden ammonite had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[light ball]]'' spell. Each eye could independently launch a brilliant ball of light, to a range of up to {{SI|90|ft}}.",
        "Combat": "In combat, golden ammonites used their long, powerful tentacles to grab onto an opponent within range. It began constricting its target, and sucker along the inside of the tentacles began draining the target's bodily fluids. If hurt, it immediately withdrew itself into its shell, remaining there until they were healed. Its shell was incredibly strong, and it was capable of self-healing any damage to it, with the most sever damage taking up to a year to regenerate.",
        "Society": {
            "Habitats": "Golden ammonites lived in abyssal canyons and trenches far below the surface of [[Toril]]'s oceans.",
            "Relationships": "Some acted as servants of the [[marid]] [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].",
            "Usages": "The shell of a golden ammonite was extremely valuable, with an intact shell selling for up to 80,000 [[gp]] at markets on the surface."
        },
        "Ecology": "Juvenile golden ammonites have never been encountered, only mature specimens. Their lifespan was unknown but it was speculated to be up to several hundred years. Golden ammonites fed directly on the ocean floor, absorbing nutrients and minerals. Their body pulled [[gold]] from their digestive system and transferred it to their shell. Occasionally golden ammonites fed on the fallen carcass of another creature."
