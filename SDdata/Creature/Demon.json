The research collected in this Demonomicon is accurate and impeccable, I assure you. But entering into battle against a demon requires more than mere knowledge. For demons are creatures of chaosâ€” mutable and forever adapting to their environment. A tactic employed successfully against an abyssal horde one time might result in your utter destruction the next.",

Interestingly, Iggwilv included [[quasit]]s in the created category, despite the fact that they were known to spontaneously arise from the Abyss.

            "Intelligence": "Demonic behaviors were less philosophically motivated and more following through on instinct, and they disliked hiding their own. Few demons made good manipulators, as chaos was a poor basis for careful plans and patience, which combined with their wickedness stopped them from fulfilling all of their long-term bargains. Even if those in power didn't kill their own servants for their amusement, they might sacrifice them in service to bizarre and nonsensical plans,\n\nEven those demons who specialized in plots could not be expected to show extreme levels of subtlety and restraint. Furthermore, it was not impossible for them to have insecurities, and despite their often-alien view of fear, some used their rage to hide what did scare them.\n\nAll this in mind, demons were not stupid, and in fact most types were very mentally competent,"

Each demon lord had a unique appearance and set of abilities. The most powerful demons lords were called demon princes. Since demons had no set hierarchy, both titles were self-proclaimed, and the demon lords and princes fought against each other constantly.
