"'''Einheriar'''" (also spelled '''Einherjar''') was a collective term for any army of the spirits of fallen [[humanoid]] warriors.

The term, which translated as "faithful",In the real world, the word ''einherjar'' means, "army of one". properly and most commonly referred to the noble warriors of [[Asgard]], however, over time, it also came to be used for the formerly mortal armies of other [[planes]], or the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] hosts of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]]. Some of the powers of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]] had einheriar in their service, including [[Ilmater]]. In the [[Netherese pantheon]], both [[Mystryl]] and [[Tyche]] were served by them. [[Eilistraee]], goddess of the good [[drow]], also had a host of einheriar. Einheriar loyal to [[Indra (deity)|Indra]] of the [[Lords of Creation]] were also known to serve the deity in the [[Indra (layer)|homonymous]] layer of [[Limbo]].

The word was also used in the singular to refer to an individual member of the einheriar.In the real-world Norse myths, a member of the ''einherjar'' was called an ''einheri''.

==Description==
Einheriar were described as wispy in form, including their armor and weapons. The majority of einheriar were once [[human]], and they still looked similar in appearance to the persons they once were in life.

Einheriar were suited in the highest quality of armor, usually with a design that hinted at the god or goddess whom they served. Rarely, their armor had minor magical enhancements.

==Personality==
Einheriar were wholly obedient to the powers or proxies who commanded them, faithfully following their orders with great fervor.

==Abilities==
Einheriar were among the toughest examples of their former race. They were exceptionally fleet of foot. They also had minor [[Magic resistance|resistance]] to magical [[spell]]s, and most were immune to fear. Sometimes, the deity who commanded the einheriar would grant them additional powers.

The greatest among them were powerful enough to be considered [[quasi-deities]]. Such individuals were impossible to [[polymorph]] and were immune to mind-affecting maladies and magics that would drain their essence or abilities. They were strongly resistant to [[fire]], to spells, and to physical attacks from all but the most powerful of magic weapons.

Einheriar were immortal. If they were killed, they would simply return to life again after a short time to fight another day.

==History==
Dwarven einheriar from [[Mount Clangeddin]] in [[Arcadia]] frequently entered [[Acheron]] to battle in epic array against the evil forces there.

The einheriar of Asgard resided in Odin's feasting hall of [[Valhalla]], waiting for the great battle of Ragnarok.

[[Elven high mage]]s had developed an [[Celestial army|epic spell]] to summon an army of einheriar to defend their homelands.

==Society==
When encountered on the planes, einheriar could be found in patrols numbering from 10 to 100 persons, marching in military units. These patrols usually included a majority of [[fighter]]s, but other classes of warriors were among their numbers as well in smaller percentages. According to estimates as few as 10% and as many as 20% were [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcasters, while from only about 3% to as many as 15% were [[Arcane magic|arcane]] casters. These were the roles that each warrior once held in life, and each recalled the full extent of his or her training and combat skills as a mortal.

There was no hierarchy among their ranks. All einheriar were equals, subservient to their commanding power or proxy.
===Diet===
As spiritual creatures, einheriar did not need to eat to survive.
===Relationships===
They respected other celestial beings as [[aasimon]] and [[Celestial archon|archons]], but they worked independently of them. Einheriar received their instructions from the powers through prayer.

Among the [[Morndinsamman]] they acted as servants of the deities [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], [[Gorm Gulthyn]], [[Haela Brightaxe]], [[Moradin]], [[Sharindlar]], and [[Thard Harr]]. The goddess [[Lliira]] particularly favored as divine servants einheriar who were once partiers or pranksters in their mortal lives.
