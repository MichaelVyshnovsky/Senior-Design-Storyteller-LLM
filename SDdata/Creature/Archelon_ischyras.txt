Archelon ischyras (), also known as archelon, was a species of large marine turtle. Archelons were technically not dinosaurs.
Archelons were large turtles, with a massive shell. Their shell was a leathery shell instead of a hard shell. It was thick and formed in plates. Archelons had a pair of large, powerful flippers. 
Their thick and strong shell provided archelons with amble defence against predators.
Archelons were found in oceans, spending most of their time in the water. 
Archelons were carnivores and were solitary creatures.
