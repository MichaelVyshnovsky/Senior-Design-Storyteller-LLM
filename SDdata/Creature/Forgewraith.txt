Forgewraiths were a type of undead that arose from one or many humanoids, usually evil in the former case, meeting their demise due to intense heat or flames in an industrial area. Most were an amalgamation of multiple weaker spirits, but those who arose from a single evil humanoid retained a soul and personality, much like a ghost.
Forgewraiths delighted in consuming their enemies with fire and pain. Those that were born from a single humanoid had higher goals and could speak the languages they knew in life.
Magical fire did minimal damage to forgewraiths, while non-magical fire did no harm to them.
Following Mount Hotenows eruption in 1451 DR,  forgewraiths could be found within the Shadowfells reflection of it.
Beyond Toril, forgewraiths were commonly found on the world of Eberron.
