        "mainbody": "'''Guardgoyles''' were [[construct]]s created by [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]]s to protect their treasures.\n\nThey resembled baby [[gargoyle]]s, hence their moniker, and their small stature (2 feet tall/long) allowed them to hide amongst a wizard's possessions. It waited ready to fly out and strike if it sensed a presence in the room it was guarding that wasn't its creator or one of the five people it could be programmed to not attack.\n\nIf not destroyed, the magic animating them would last as long as their creator lived. Any repairs that they needed could be administered with a single ''[[stone shape]]'' spell. Due to these facts and that they only cost around 1000 [[gold piece]]s worth of raw materials to create, guardgoyles were cheap and effective guardians.\n\nGreater guardgoyles tended to be between 4â€“6 feet tall and lacked the ability to fly. They were also much more expensive to create and required much more powerful magic to animate them."
