'''Giant weasels''', also known as '''dire weasels''', were a species of larger than normal [[weasel]]s. 

==Description==
Dire weasels had sleek, long bodies up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} long and could reach a weight of {{SI|700|lb|k|long=yes}}. Those that dwell in [[the North]] were known to have white coats. And rarely, some giant weasels were born with an entirely black coloration.

==Biology==
Giant weasels had a unique agent within their saliva that, when in contact with a creature's open wound, prevented the clotting process in blood and promoted greater bleeding.

==Behavior==
Giant weasels were known to be far more vicious than their smaller cousins and were often just as willing to attack [[humanoid]] creatures as they were normal prey.

==Combat==
Once a giant weasel had its jaws locked onto a creature it was very reluctant to let go and would suck at their victim's blood. Due to the special agent within their saliva, the amount of bleeding would be excessive.

==Ecology==
Unlike their smaller cousins, who were rather solitary creatures, giant weasels typically lived and hunted in packs.
===Habitats===
A number of giant weasels were known to serve the mad [[druid]] [[Wyllow]] within [[Wyllowwood|her domain]] of [[Undermountain]].
 
Giant weasels were also known to inhabit the fens, salt flats, and coniferous forests of the [[Moonshae Isles]], the forests of [[Cormanthor]], and [[Semberholme]].
===Relationships===
Much like their smaller cousins, giant weasels were often trained and domesticated to be hunting companions or guard animals.

===Usage===
Before the [[Second Sundering]], giant weasel pelts were generally known to sell found around 1,000 to 6,000 [[gp]]. The white pelts of the northern giant weasel, as well as the pelts of the rare black giant weasel, both typically sold for more.

==Trivia==
Giant weasels were [[favored animal]]s of the [[gnomish]] gods [[Garl Glittergold]] and [[Segojan Earthcaller]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}
