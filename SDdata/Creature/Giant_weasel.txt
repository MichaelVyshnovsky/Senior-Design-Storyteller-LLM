Giant weasels, also known as dire weasels, were a species of larger than normal weasels. 
Dire weasels had sleek, long bodies up to  long and could reach a weight of . Those that dwell in the North were known to have white coats. And rarely, some giant weasels were born with an entirely black coloration.
Giant weasels had a unique agent within their saliva that, when in contact with a creatures open wound, prevented the clotting process in blood and promoted greater bleeding.
Giant weasels were known to be far more vicious than their smaller cousins and were often just as willing to attack humanoid creatures as they were normal prey.
Once a giant weasel had its jaws locked onto a creature it was very reluctant to let go and would suck at their victims blood. Due to the special agent within their saliva, the amount of bleeding would be excessive.
Unlike their smaller cousins, who were rather solitary creatures, giant weasels typically lived and hunted in packs.
A number of giant weasels were known to serve the mad druid Wyllow within her domain of Undermountain.
Giant weasels were also known to inhabit the fens, salt flats, and coniferous forests of the Moonshae Isles, the forests of Cormanthor, and Semberholme.
Much like their smaller cousins, giant weasels were often trained and domesticated to be hunting companions or guard animals.
Before the Second Sundering, giant weasel pelts were generally known to sell found around 1,000 to 6,000 gp. The white pelts of the northern giant weasel, as well as the pelts of the rare black giant weasel, both typically sold for more.
Giant weasels were favored animals of the gnomish gods Garl Glittergold and Segojan Earthcaller.
