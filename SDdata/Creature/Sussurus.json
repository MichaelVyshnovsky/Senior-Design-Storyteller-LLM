        "mainbody": "A '''sussurus''' ({{Pronounce|SUS|u|r|us|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}}; {{Plural|sussuri}}), also known as a '''susurrus''', '''headless droning ape''', or '''singing ape''', was a creature with an [[undead]]-pacifying dronesong.",
        "Description": "Sussuri appeared as headless quadrupedal figures of vaguely humanoid, almost [[ape]]-like shape. They had an exoskeleton filled with small gaps that drew in sustaining air, which created the creature's signature dronesong. \n\nSome sages considered sussuri to be a form of [[plant creature|plantlife]], distantly related to the [[shambling mound]]. Their accounts described the creatures as being made up of rotting [[bamboo]]. Others claimed that sussuri appeared to be covered in shards of [[glass]], which encircled the holes that riddled their bodies.",
        "Abilities": "By constantly inhaling air, sussuri generated a dronesong which sounded like wind blowing gently through trees. This sound could render certain types of undead peaceful and torpid, similarly to the effects of ''[[hold undead]]'', in a phenomenon which was known as the \"sleep of the dead\". Some sussuri were able to affect the living in a likewise manner, sometimes knocking unsuspecting adventurers out for as long as half a day.\n\nSussuri achieved a form of [[blindsight]] by detecting disruptions in the airflow travelling through their exoskeletal tubes, thus rendering them immune to most conventional magical means of impeding or evading sight or hearing. However, they could apparently be blinded by ''[[fog cloud]]s'' and similar magic.",
        "Behavior": "Although typically peaceful, sussuri became agitated around any undead and those carrying torches, wielding flame or otherwise tainting the air they needed to survive. Otherwise, they kept to themselves.",
        "Combat": "In combat, the sussuri used their claws to tear their foes to shreds. It could grapple it's foes after it had dug it's claws in. Against undead foes, it's dronesong caused undead to become unable to move, pacified by the sound. Any creature that attacked the sussurus with handheld weapons, teeth or claws would cut itself on the aberration's jagged glass-like skin.\n\nThey could attack incorporeal undead as if they were made of living flesh.\n\nSussuri were generally vulnerable to plant-affecting spells, albeit less so than most plant creatures. They were rumored to be especially susceptible to the effects of ''[[warp wood]]''.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Sussuri were known to inhabit a wide variety of temperate-to-tropical environments, but some populations specifically required a hot, rainy, plant-rich environment. Others, however, were content to roam underground areas, such as dungeons.\n\nThose sussuri whose territories overlapped with those of shambling mounds often violently competed with their evolutionary cousins over territory and prey."
