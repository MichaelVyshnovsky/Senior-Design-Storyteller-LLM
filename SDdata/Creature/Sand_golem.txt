A '''sand golem''' was an intelligent [[construct]] that was acclimated to desert environments.

==Description==
Sand golems appeared muscular, but could have either slender or bulky builds. They had [[sand]]-colored bodies, and released sandy dust when they walked.

==Behavior==
These automatons endlessly patrolled warm desert areas. Sand golems could not speak, and could only voice dry hissing sounds.

These golems were connected to their masters via [[magic]]al [[amulet]]s, which were usually sculpted into the shape of desert-dwelling arthropods. Sand golems obeyed their masters' commands unfailingly, and would come to their call from any distance.

Such constructs possessed intelligence, and exploited these wits in combat. Thus, sand [[golem]]s were often difficult to fight due to their advanced tactics, as well as their natural strength. Despite their strength, these golems could utilize stealth to appear as nothing more than piles of sand.

==Combat==
The combined strength, intelligence, and ability to be stealthy made sand golems difficult opponents, but these features were not the only thing for challengers to be wary of. They were known for their uncanny evasiveness, making them able to dodge all but the most precise blows. Using a mixture of battleground tactics, sand golems waited for the exact moment to transform into a sandstorm. In their sandstorm form, they fiercely attacked and blinded their foes. 

Sand golems generally fought with their powerful fists, but could also suffocate their opponents with the sand and dust that formed their bodies.

As with other golems, they were immune to [[disease]] and [[poison]]. Such constructs were also immune to any [[spell]]s that allowed [[magic]] resistance, and some spells functioned differently against them. Spells that involved blasts of sand would heal the golems instead of hurt them.

==Creation==
To construct a sand golem, a [[mage]] needed 1000 cubic feet (28 cubic meters) of specially treated sand, a specific set of sand-related spells, and several pieces of [[gold]]. The sand had to be treated with expensive powders and volcanic ash. Only experienced crafters and sculpters could create such a golem, and the mages needed to have access to several spells, such as ''[[geas/quest]]''. The price of such a golem was approximately 50,000 [[gp]].

==History==
[[File:Ce'Nedra's sand golem.jpg|thumb|''[[Ce'Nedra]] in her sand golem form.''|300x300px]]
Sometime before [[1360 DR]], the evil [[sorceress]] [[Ce'Nedra]] transformed herself into a deadly sand golem to murder the [[Bedine]] inhabitants of the area later known as the Oasis of [[Ma'atar]].

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a sand golem was known to wander outside the ruins of [[Oreme]] in [[Anauroch]].
