They were covered in feathers except the legs, which were light gray. They had large black claws on each foot. Both females and males looked the same, except the male had a crest of red feathers and large orange feathers growing from the back of its head.\nPhororhacos were very territorial. Male phororhacos often fought over territory.\nPhororhacos were fierce, deadly fighters. It did not hesitate to attack, even if it was outnumbered. Their beak and claws were dangerous weapons. Its main tactic was to shriek a loud battle cry and jump onto a target, clawing and biting until its target was killed.\nPhororhacos lived and hunted together in familial flocks. \nPhororhacos could be domesticated and trained to be guards and mounts. Their eggs and young could be sold for up to 100 gp."
