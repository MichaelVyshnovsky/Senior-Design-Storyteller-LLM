        "Description": "Avorals looked mostly humanoid, but possessed wings instead of arms, feathered bird-like legs, and feathers on their heads in place of hair. The wings did have a small hand at the midpoint, so that it could function as an arm when folded. Their keen eyes were bright golden. Avorals stood about 6 and a half feet to {{SI|7|ft}} tall and had a {{SI|20|ft}} wingspan, but due to their hollow bones only weighed about {{SI|120|lbs}}. They could carry up to {{SI|300|lbs}} while flying.",
