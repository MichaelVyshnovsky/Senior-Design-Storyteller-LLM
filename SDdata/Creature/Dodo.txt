Dodos were a species of small flightless birds that were quite common in some areas of the world.
The good folk of the Blade Kingdoms and the city-state of Sumbria were familiar with dodos. These birds were considered to be dull-witted and sometimes the word was used to describe a person lacking intelligence.
Outside of Toril, dodos were considered boringly common domesticated birds.
