        "mainbody": "Eyes of shadow were beholders that had been warped by too much time spent in areas connected to the Shadowfell.\nThese creatures delighted in arousing fear in their victims.\nAn eye of shadow possessed four different eye-beam abilities. Their central eye could induce fear in their enemies. The abilities of their other eye beams included a ray of radiant energy that temporarily blinded their foes, a deafening ray of thunderous sound, and a ray of necrotic energy that temporarily immobilized those hit by it. In addition, those hit by this shadowbond ray were unable to see an eye of shadow or other shadow creatures that were close by.\nDue to being tainted by the Shadowfell, these creatures were also very stealthy and could make themselves appear invisible in areas of darkness.\nLike all beholders, these creatures fought by means of their eyebeams and toothy maws.\nWhenever the Dreamheart opened its eye, an eye of shadow was one of the creatures that would potentially be summoned by it."
