        "mainbody": "A beaver was a small common mammal.\nBeavers constructed homes from wood that they gnawed from trees. Their homes were often close to, or in, ponds.\nThey were of no threat to adventurers, as they dealt minimal damage and were not well naturally armored. Such small creatures were not particularly fast on either land or water.\nBeavers appeared in packs from as little as ten, to up to forty.\nHumans, dwarves, and others of the goodly races throughout Faer√ªn, would often kill and skin beavers for their pelts. Such pelts were valued at 2 gp each.\nGiant beavers, huge and dangerous beavers, were known to exist in the Moonshae Isles."
