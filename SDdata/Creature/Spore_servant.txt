Spore servants were the animated remains of the dead, given a second existence by myconid sovereigns.
Most once-living organic creatures could be transformed into a spore servant after their death. Exceptions included non-living entities, such as constructs or undead, or those without flesh and blood, including plants, elementals, and oozes.
Spore servants had a lifespan of anywhere from two to five weeks, or until they were destroyed. Once destroyed, the body of a spore servant could not be animated once again.
Spore servants lost all spoken forms of communication they had in life. They could still communicate via rapport spores that were utilized by myconids and their sovereigns.
Spore servants would try to bludgeon or otherwise assail any creature that threatened its creator, or other allied myconids. They did not retain any specialized combat abilities or powers beyond attacking with their limbs, claws, tails, etc.
While the process of creating a spore servant was near instantaneous, the gestation period took up to 24 hours.

As of the , numerous spore servants of duergar, hook horrors, and other Underdark denizens could be found roaming around Ebonlake Grotto.
