Euparkeria (), also known as runner among the denizens of the Malatran Plateau, was a species of dinosaur.
Euparkerias were small dinosaurs with four legs and a tail.  
Euparkerias hunted in packs. They usually targeted small prey and humanoids. They have been known to stalk a wounded creature much larger than they were. As a defensive measure, they had the ability to run upright on their hind legs for a short distance.
Euparkerias were carnivores and lived together in small groups.
