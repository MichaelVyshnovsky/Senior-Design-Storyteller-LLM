        "mainbody": "Obsidian gargoyles were a variant of gargoyles originating from the Elemental Chaos that had jagged bodies of obsidian and were selectively bred by cultists of the Elder Elemental Eye to be loyal servants willing to give their lives for their masters.\nThese gargoyles fought in the same manner as their more common kin, but due to the jagged edges across their bodies it was far more difficult and hazardous to escape from ones grasp.\nIn 1479 DR, obsidian gargoyles could be found within Mount Hotenow."
