Drakens were small, three-headed dragonets that inhabited the Calim Desert.
Drakens looked like smaller, darker-colored blue dragons with three heads. The wings and eyes were tinged with cyan.
Drakens were known to be irritable.
Draken breathed lightning in  lines, with each head being to breathe a bolt twice a day, one at a time. Additionally, when biting with two heads at a time, they could also shock the victim with an effect akin to shocking grasp. Drakens themselves were immune to electrical attacks, as well as to sleep spells.
Draken primarily used their electrical abilities and teeth in combat, never their claws.
Drakens grew to adulthood within a year from hatching.
