'''Brigganocks''' were a species of tiny [[fey]] whose spirits manifested outside of their bodies.
{{TOC_limit|3}}
==Description==
Brigganocks were about the size of [[mice]]. They always had a bulb of pale light—their spirit—nearby their body.

==Personality==
Brigganocks were frantic but inoffensive creatures, and were generally benevolent towards others.

==Abilities==
Like other fey, brigganocks were difficult to charm and impossible to render asleep via [[magic]]. However, they lacked the typical [[low-light vision]] or [[darkvision]] because their surroundings were always lit by their spirit-light, which illuminated {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} with bright light, and which they could move with a thought up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} away for short periods of time. The brigganock could not dim nor hide their spirit-light, and it faded away when the brigganock died.

Brigganocks had an unusual ability to accelerate time around themselves, allowing them to accomplish one hour's worth of work in a matter of seconds. However, this ability took a toll on them, requiring them to rest between each usage, and the whole of the activity had to happen within a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} cube of space.

Brigganocks could naturally cast ''[[minor illusion]]'' and ''[[spare the dying]]'' at will, and ''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', and ''[[silence]]'' each once per day.

==Combat==
When they had to fight, brigganocks relied on their natural spellcasting ability and their [[pickaxe]]s.

==Society==
Brigganocks spent most of their time seeking out the wish-stones that formed underground in the [[Feywild]]. They refined these stones into gems that they used to decorate their buildings and items, or traded them to other fey for food or favors. Brigganocks only kept wish-stones formed from good intentions; they discarded those formed from malevolent wishes. Brigganocks preferred to eat [[lettuce]], [[cheese]], and other soft foods; they ate a considerable amount of food compared to their small size.
