        "mainbody": "'''Radiance quasi-elementals''' were [[elemental]]s formed from the quasi-element known as radiance.",
        "Description": "These elementals looked to be rapidly turning spheres of multicolored light. When they reduced their amount of spinning, they took on an appearance similar to that of a [[will-o'-wisp]]. Their steady, orderly glow varied only by their continual smooth spinning. Some were known to mistake them for [[lightning quasi-elemental]]s.",
        "Behavior": "Radiance quasi-elementals possessed low levels of intelligence, but were capable of telling friends and foes apart. They were also intelligent enough to discern whether or not the beams they used against an opponent were being effective.",
        "Abilities": "Radiance quasi-elementals radiated a glow equivalent to a double-strength ''[[continual light]]'' [[spell]]. By spinning more rapidly, they could cause this effect to blind creatures around, in {{SI|120|yards}}, them for two to twenty days. Spells that created or controlled darkness would not only prevent this effect, but also cause harm to them. Otherwise, these elementals could only be harmed by weapons with a ''+1 or greater [[item enchantment|enchantment]]''. They also possessed some resistance towards [[fire]], cold, and electricity.\n\nThey were able to defend themselves by blasting {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} wide beams of pure light at their enemies. They could emit seven different kinds of beams, each of which imparted a different type of effect depending upon their color. Any [[magical item]] that offered protection from the equivalent effect would function as normal.\n\nRed beams had intense cold, while orange beams imparted intense heat. Green beams were [[poison]]ous, while yellow beams imparted an effect similar to [[acid]]. Blue beams imparted an effect similar to electricity, while indigo had an effect similar to [[holy water]]. Finally, violet beams imparted magical force upon their target.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some believed that the most intelligent of radiance quasi-elementals were philosophers who stood still for eons in peaceful contemplation.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "They elementals were primarily found on the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance]]. They were only rarely found on the [[Prime Material plane]] in areas of spectacular events, such as double-arched rainbows and multi-hued [[meteor]] showers in the nights' sky.",
            "Relationships": "Some powerful [[mage]]s were known to capture these elementals, using them as both guards and light sources in their domains.\n\nRadiance quasi-elementals were a [[favored monster]] of the [[deities]] [[Eilistraee]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], and [[Sehanine Moonbow]]."
