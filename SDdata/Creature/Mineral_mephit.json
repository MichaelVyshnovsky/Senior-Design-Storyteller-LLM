        "Description": "Mineral mephits were bulky and rigid, as were [[earth mephit]]s. Their metal wings glittered with shiny pieces of silica, but didn't actually function during flight. These odorless mephits were very clumsy during such flight.\n\nThese creatures could pass through stone walls up to {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} thick, as if they were insubstantial. Oddly enough, these mineral mephits didn't breathe at all.",
        "Personality": "Such mephits were self-centered, stubborn, and greedy, an attitude typical of those of their home plane. They guarded their own treasure vigilantly, and may have guarded valuables belonging to other creatures.\n\nThey were known to generally have an enmity towards any creatures who tried to take minerals from the plane.",
        "Combat": "During combat, mineral mephits attacked with their claws, and used ''[[glitterdust]]'' to blind and reveal their foes. They could also ''[[gate]]'' in other mephits, but only their own type and [[earth mephit]]s.\n\nThey were immune to all gas-based attacks and [[spell]]s, such as those that filled areas with ''[[stinking cloud|stinking gas]]''. Non-[[magic]]al weapons that pierced did not affect them, but [[transmute rock to mud|transmuting rock to mud]] would instantly morph their shape, killing them. When in contact with rocks or jewelry, they could regenerate quickly, but consumed [[gem]]s in the process."
