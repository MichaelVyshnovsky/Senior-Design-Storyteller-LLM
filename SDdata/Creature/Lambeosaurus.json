        "mainbody": "A lambeosaurus (), also known as duck bill among denizens of the Malatran Plateau, was a species of dinosaur.\nThe lambeosaurus looked like other hadrosaurs. Its main distinguishing feature was the two crests on its head. A crest of solid bone rose up from the back of the head, and a hollow crest was found on their snout.\nLambeosaurs main form of defense from predators was to simply outrun them. Otherwise, when a predator was detected, the lambeosaurus would conceal itself, ideally in a swamp or marshy area.\nLambeosaurs possessed excellent senses of hearing, sight and smell. This allowed them to detect the presence of a predator before it was directly threatened.\nLambeosaurs were herbivores and lived together in herds. They had powerful teeth that allowed them to consume almost any vegetation."
