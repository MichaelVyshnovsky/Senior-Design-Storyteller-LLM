        "mainbody": "Abyssal wretches were a type of fiend found in the Abyss.\nThe body of an abyssal wretch was a disfigured version of its original body. \nAbyssal wretches attacked a target with whatever weapon they could wield.\nAbyssal wretches were immune to all types of poison. They were also hardened against cold-, fire-, or lightning-based attacks. An abyssal wretch could not be charmed or frightened.\nAbyssal wretches were the unfortunate humanoid victims of rutterkins and sibriex. A humanoid bitten by a rutterkin slowly succumbed to a terrible disease, poisoning the victim with the corruption of the Abyss. If left untreated, the victim died and was then transformed into an abyssal wretch. \nA sibriex transformed a humanoid into an abyssal wretch in a similar fashion. Instead of physical contact, a sibriex was capable of poisoning a target from up to  away. When the target died of the vile disease, they were transformed into an abyssal wretch, under the control of the sibriex.\nThe only way to reverse the transformation was via a wish spell."
