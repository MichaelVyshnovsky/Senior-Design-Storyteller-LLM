A humanoid bitten by a rutterkin slowly succumbed to a terrible disease, poisoning the victim with the corruption of the Abyss. If left untreated, the victim died and was then transformed into an abyssal wretch. \n\nA sibriex transformed a humanoid into an abyssal wretch in a similar fashion. Instead of physical contact, a sibriex was capable of poisoning a target from up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} away. When the target died of the vile disease, they were transformed into an abyssal wretch, under the control of the sibriex.\n\nThe only way to reverse the transformation was via a ''[[wish]]'' spell."
