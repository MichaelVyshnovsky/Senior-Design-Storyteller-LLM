        "Description": "Snow elves were thin and slender like all elves, but were tough and wiry, as well as much taller: female snow elves were known to stand as much as {{SI|6'4\"|'\"}} tall, and males as much as {{SI|7|ft}}. They had pale skin, white or light blond hair that curled into wisps, and white or silver eyes.\n\nThey typically wore white clothing and favored bone jewelry.",

Nonetheless, the snow elves explained some of the differences between them and other elves was due to them being directly descended from Tarsellis (a view most other elven scholars were skeptical about)."
        },
        "History": "The tension between snow elves and other elves was said to date back to the [[Fourth Crown War|wars]] that forced the drow into the [[Underdark]]: not knowing that the drow had turned to [[Lolth]] and declared war upon the rest of the elven people, the snow elves were deceived into allowing the drow passage, albeit for a large profit, through a mountain pass controlled by the snow elves. The other elves never formally condemned them for this, but tensions remained and snow elves withdrew into isolation."
