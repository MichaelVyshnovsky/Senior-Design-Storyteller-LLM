A moose was a large animal that was found in many places across Faerûn.
Moose roamed the northern lands, such as the Savage Frontier. Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in the sub-arctic forests of Kara-Tur.
Moose were often hunted for their meat by a variety of races, from elves to storm giants. Omnivorous elves often ate moose meat, which they marinated in many herbs to rid the seasonal taste. Giants also cooked and consumed moose meat, as well as humans.
