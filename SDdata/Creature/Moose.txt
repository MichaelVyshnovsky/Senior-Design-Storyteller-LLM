A '''moose''' was a large [[animal]] that was found in many places across [[Faerûn]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Moose roamed the northern lands, such as the [[Savage Frontier]]. Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in the sub-arctic forests of [[Kara-Tur]].
===Usages===
Moose were often hunted for their meat by a variety of races, from [[elves]] to [[storm giant]]s. Omnivorous elves often ate moose meat, which they marinated in many [[herb]]s to rid the seasonal taste. [[Giant]]s also cooked and consumed moose meat, as well as [[human]]s.
