        "Description": "[[File:Alioramus of a feather.jpg|thumb|''A variety of alioramuses with different colorations.'']]\nAlioramus were dangerous and meticulous hunters. They had powerful jaws that could crush a set of inch-thick [[plate mail]]. They had colorful hides and feathers and clawed three-toed limbs.",
        "Combat": "Alioramus attacked with their sharp, raking claws and powerful jaws, causing open wounds and bleeding. In combat, they pounced on their victims, pushing them to the ground into a vulnerable position. The largest of the species, alioramus colossa, could provoke a mating frenzy by exuding mating pheromones, driving its pack into a [[berserker]]-like rage, strengthening the pack's attacks and making them temporarily resistant to harm and unaffected by ''[[charm]]'' or ''[[fear]]''."
