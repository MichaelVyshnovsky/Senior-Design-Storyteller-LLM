        "mainbody": "A gulguthra, also known as a dung-eater, was a type of aberration. The well-known gulghuthras of the Realms were otyughs and neo-otyughs.\nGulguthras had tentacles that could grow up to 14 feet (4.3 meters) long, and they could communicate telepathically. However, gulguthras rarely used this form of communication, as they often did not interact with other creatures. Relying on their keen visual sense, such creatures could sense others with infravision and ultravision, but could not smell.\nEvery seven years, gulguthras would reproduce by creating eggmass, a gelatinous mass of eggs. The ovulating gulguthras would then descend underground to find other dung eaters, and regurgitate the eggmass. Any other gulguthra, even those of a different type, could then fertilize the eggmass, but the details of this process were unknown. As all dung eaters were bisexual,The source says \"bisexual\", but this most likely is meant to mean hermaphroditic. it was not often difficult to find a mate willing to fertilize the eggmass. After a while, the fertilized eggmass would produce a newborn gulguthra, which would then become adults in approximately four months.\nElminster Aumar studied such creatures, from their combat abilities to their ecology. The sage had garnered information from the knowledgeable svirfnebli, as well as a sorcerer called Jovriam of the Mines.\nRare creatures that lurked in the Farsea Marshes, known as gulguthydrae, were the combination of gulguthras and hydrae.\nSome gulguthras were known to inhabit the Marsh of Chelimber."
