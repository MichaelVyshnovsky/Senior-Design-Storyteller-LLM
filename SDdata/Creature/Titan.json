        "mainbody": "Titans, called voninjotunen in their own language, were the largest of the true giant races, standing even taller than cloud or storm giants. In the social order of giants, they were ranked highest on the Ordning, above all other giants, giant-kin, and ogres.\nTitans resembled large, muscular humans who typically lacked facial hair.\nTitans were typically some of the most intelligent of giants.\nMany titans were capable spellcasters or psionicists.Realms sources did not make an effort to denote the distinction between the titans of Lanaxis and the titans of Greek myth. The latter were clearly the basis for the titans detailed in monster manuals&mdashtheir write up in 2nd edition explicitly talks of Olympus and Greek clothing, plus the setting-neutral book Monster Mythology states they have an affinity for the Greek pantheon. Because of all this, its hard to say whether or not this info truly applies to the titans of Toril.. And they were the only race of giants not known to have runecasters.\nThey also had numerous spell-like abilities. Such as holy smite, meteor swarm, and chain lightning. Some were capable of becoming invisible at will, levitating, and becoming ethereal at least twice a day.\nTitans typically wielded a huge warhammer but also carried javelins to throw.\nThe titan race began with an individual by the name of Lanaxis, one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea.\nAround , a titan thane named Omo was engaged in combat with Zhoukoudien, leader of the Batrachi. Omo ended up slaying him and inciting war between their people. The titans would come to dominate the batrachi in this war and, according to Abeiran scholars, it would lead the latter to perform a powerful summoning ritual that culminated in the Tearfall.\nWhen Annam founded the kingdom of Ostoria he ceded control of the plains to Lanaxis, who would found the dynasty of the titans, east of the Great Rift in the land of Eastern Shaar. The titans and storm giants would create some of Ostorias greatest cities, featuring mechanical conveyances and galleries that would house artistic tributes to all giantkind.\nThe eventual disappearance of titans on Abeir-Toril was a matter of speculation. According to one myth popularized by the book, History of the Last March of the Giants, the titans grew so arrogant that they challenged the gods. They in turn cursed their monarch with fascination and his subjects with absolute devotion to him. They then sent a star crashing down to the planet and through their nation, causing widespread catastrophes and leaving a huge valley that became the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nBeing cursed with curiosity, the then-king of the titans chased after the star and his dutiful subjects followed suit. They chased it all the way to the Great Sea and then dove in after it, never to be seen again.\nFollowing the fall of Ostoria, titans were primarily found on planes other than the Prime Material, such as Arborea and Warriors Rest.\nAs inhabitants of the Outer Planes, titans were often known to be capable of speaking the Abyssal and Celestial languages. Many were also known to speak Draconic, Common, and all six dialects of Giant.\nOut of all the giant races, titans were the most amicable towards storm giants due to their disposition.\n* Lanaxis\n* Omo\n* Rammaq"
