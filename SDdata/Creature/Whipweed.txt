Whipweeds were a semi-intelligent, omnivorous species of plant creature that exhibited some behaviors that were considered to be unlike that of a plant.
A whipweed consisted of a spheroidal base, measuring  in diameter, housing a sort of small brain and sporting eight small, root-like legs that it could pull up underneath itself. Their bodies sported no mouth and it was unknown why felt a need to embed their "roots" into the earth, as it was found could survive indefinitely in areas without soil. From their body sprouted two thin, whipping appendages that resembled look like small leaves. On average these grew to be a length of .
Unlike most plants, these creatures abhorred sunlight.
Removing the leafy appendages of a whipweed would not kill it, though if both appendages were removed it would attempt to flee from its attacker. If the creature itself killed was, then its stalks would impulsively flail around violently for a short period.
As their name implied, these creatures attacked their prey by whipping it with their leafy appendages.
It was not certain how whipweeds obtained sustenance from the creatures they killed, though observation of them feeding seemed to imply that their leafy appendages gradually absorbed its food and transferred it internally.
Whipweeds were typically found either underground within deep forests shaded from the sun.
In north Faer√ªn, whipweeds could be found in the northern regions of the Moonsea, around the ruins of Old Phlan.
