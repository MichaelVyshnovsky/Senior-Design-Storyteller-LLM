'''Minimals''', a contraction of "miniature animals", Generally speaking, they were miniature versions of various mundane mammals.

==Description==
Minimals were exactly like their normal-sized animal relatives in every aspect.

==Personality==
These creatures conformed to their full-sized counterparts in most respects, but had chaotic tendencies. Carnivorous minimals were slightly more aggressive.

==Abilities==
Compared to their full-sized counterparts, minimals exhibited a greater degree of resistance to [[spell]]s that [[charm]]ed them, such as the ''[[animal friendship]]'' spell. And they were incapable of becoming [[familiar]]s.

==Combat==
Minimals generally would not attack creatures larger than themselves unless they had superior numbers. Rather, carnivorous minimals preyed upon creatures smaller than themselves. They fought in the same manner as their larger counterparts.

==Notable Minimals==
* [[Eclipse]], a [[panther|black panther]] minimal in [[Ravens Bluff]] that belonged to [[Kavan Brenzan]].{{Cite polyhedron/70/The Living City: Signs Painted|16}}

==Ecology==
Compared to their full-sized counterparts, minimals had a greater tendency to group or herd together.
===Relationships===
In the wild, minimals were sometimes found in the company of small [[humanoid]]s

==History==
It was believed that some form of powerful [[magic]] was used to created the minimal animals found on Bulta. The entire environment on the island appeared to have been magically altered as even the trees were half-sized. One rumor persisted that the entire island of Bulta was once much larger.
