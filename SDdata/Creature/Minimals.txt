Minimals, a contraction of "miniature animals", Generally speaking, they were miniature versions of various mundane mammals.
Minimals were exactly like their normal-sized animal relatives in every aspect.
These creatures conformed to their full-sized counterparts in most respects, but had chaotic tendencies. Carnivorous minimals were slightly more aggressive.
Compared to their full-sized counterparts, minimals exhibited a greater degree of resistance to spells that charmed them, such as the animal friendship spell. And they were incapable of becoming familiars.
Minimals generally would not attack creatures larger than themselves unless they had superior numbers. Rather, carnivorous minimals preyed upon creatures smaller than themselves. They fought in the same manner as their larger counterparts.
