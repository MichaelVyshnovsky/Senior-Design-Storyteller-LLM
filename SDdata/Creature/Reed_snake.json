        "mainbody": "'''Reed snakes''', also known as '''thin snakes''', were a species of small venomous [[snake]]s.",
        "Description": "Reed snakes were small and very thin, usually no more than {{SI|4|feet|long=yes}} long with bodies no thicker than the stem of a small flower. Their dull green scales allowed them to blend in with grass.",
        "Combat": "A bite from a reed snake released a deadly toxin into the bloodstream of its prey. Due to their size, they only attacked sleeping prey, including [[humanoid]]s. The bite from a reed snake was usually fatal and caused great pain in the victim, beginning as a slight sting at the site of the bite and eventually radiating throughout the whole body. A ''[[neutralize poison]]'' spell neutralized the effects of the venom,",
        "Habitat": "Reed snakes lived in the temperate grasslands of [[Pelleor's Prairie]] in the [[Backlands]] region of the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Ecology": "Reed snakes hunted during the night. They spent the daytime hours hiding and sleeping, hiding within long grasses or reeds."
