        "mainbody": "Reed snakes, also known as thin snakes, were a species of small venomous snakes.\nReed snakes were small and very thin, usually no more than  long with bodies no thicker than the stem of a small flower. Their dull green scales allowed them to blend in with grass.\nA bite from a reed snake released a deadly toxin into the bloodstream of its prey. Due to their size, they only attacked sleeping prey, including humanoids. The bite from a reed snake was usually fatal and caused great pain in the victim, beginning as a slight sting at the site of the bite and eventually radiating throughout the whole body. A neutralize poison spell neutralized the effects of the venom,\nReed snakes lived in the temperate grasslands of Pelleors Prairie in the Backlands region of the Western Heartlands.\nReed snakes hunted during the night. They spent the daytime hours hiding and sleeping, hiding within long grasses or reeds."
