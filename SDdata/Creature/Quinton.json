        "Description": "Quintons were tall yet heavyset humanoids with four arms and a prehensile tail, all of which sported a five-fingered hand. They had a pair of wings that resembled fans on their backs. Upon their forehead was a diamond symbol, which denoted their rank.",
        "Combat": "If forced into combat, quintons used a combination of innate abilities, spells and their fists.",
        "Abilities": "Like all hierarch modrons, quintons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Quintons were able to cast [[divine]] spells from the [[Law domain|Law]], [[Protection domain|Protection]] and [[War domain|War]] domains. Quintons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.",
        "Society": "There were exactly twenty-five quintons in modron societyâ€”one stationed at each of the twenty bureaus in the region and quarter towers, and five in the bureaus at [[Primus Tower]] at the capital. They acted as the bureau chiefs and record keepers of [[Mechanus|Nirvana]].\n\nEach quinton had one [[hexton]] assistant, plus a staff of one [[septon]], twenty-five [[pentadrone]]s, sixty-four [[quadrone]]s, eighty-one [[tridrone]]s, and an unknown number of [[duodrone]]s and [[monodrone]]s.",
        "Ecology": "Quintons were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within {{SI|238|mi|k}} and could see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}.",
        "History": "The [[Great Modron March]], the periodic tour of the [[Outer Planes]] carried out once every 289 years, was led by a quinton, who was also the chief record-keeper of the voyage. The march passed briefly through [[Undermountain]], using one of the rare ''[[portal]]s'' that led out of [[Carceri]]."
