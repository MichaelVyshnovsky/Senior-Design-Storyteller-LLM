        "mainbody": "dire lion was a larger cousin of the lion.\nDire lions could grow as large as fifteen feet long and weigh as much as 3,500 pounds. They resembled normal lions in that they had tawny fur with spots and that the males had short manes. They differed from normal lions in having bony spine and brow ridges.\nDire lions showed similar behavior to normal lions in how they patiently stalked their prey, yet they would take on much larger creatures. They liked to hide in tall grass or heavy undergrowth.\nLike normal lions, dire lions would rush at and pounce upon their prey, clinging to it with their powerful jaws and clawing with all four paws.\nDire lions were found as sole individuals, in pairs, or as small prides of between six and ten animals.\nCloud giants often kept dire lions as pets or guardians. Powerful druids or rangers were known to have such animals as companions."
