        "mainbody": "An angel of decay, also called a rot harbinger, was an undead monstrosity powered by decay, a mockery of true angels.\nAngels of decay resembled the celestial outsiders more by happenstance rather than design, with a vaguely humanoid form and wings. They stood about  tall and weighed approximately . Their bodies were constantly rotting and streaming off liquid corruption.\nWhen they spoke they did so with a slurred, muddy voice.\nWhen angels of decay stood upon the ground, the liquid corruption that they shed formed a pool around them up to  in radius this pool caused living creatures that touched to begin to decay themselves. Additionally, when angels of decay attacked with their claws and wings, their very touch caused injuries to rot.\nRot harbingers generally preferred to fight in melee because of their decay-inducing touch, although some were known to throw balls of necrotizing material at enemies.\nWhen healthy creatures rotted and liquified in death, some indefinable essence drifted away, and the decomposing flesh radiated an energy that angels of decay \"fed\" upon.\nAngels of decay were created after a legion of angels tried to slay the demon lord Orcus while he was traveling outside of the Abyss. However, Orcus slew every last one of them instead and, when he returned to the Abyss, created the first rot harbingers as a mockery of the angels and sent them into the natural world to wreak havoc.\nOn occasions, the goddess Shar managed to corrupt some Shards of Sel√ªne, transforming them into angels of decay to do her bidding.\nAn angel of decay named Shex was a field commander for an army of undead."
