        "Description": "Mountain wemics were said to resemble great [[mountain lion]]s with the upper torso of a [[humanoid]]. They were smaller in frame than common wemics, and their males lacked manes.",
        "Ecology": "The existence of mountain wemics was little more than rumor as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but they were said to be found in dangerous regions throughout the [[Thunder Peaks]] and [[Desertsmouth Mountains]] in [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]].\n\nThey culturally differed from their more abundant cousins in a number of ways. They were not nomadic pack hunters, but rather solitary creatures that hunted alone or in pairs. Their preferred weapon was the [[club]]."
