        "mainbody": "Mountain wemics were a rumored species of monstrous tauric beasts, distantly related to the wemics of Faerûns grasslands.\nMountain wemics were said to resemble great mountain lions with the upper torso of a humanoid. They were smaller in frame than common wemics, and their males lacked manes.\nThe existence of mountain wemics was little more than rumor as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, but they were said to be found in dangerous regions throughout the Thunder Peaks and Desertsmouth Mountains in central Faerûn.\nThey culturally differed from their more abundant cousins in a number of ways. They were not nomadic pack hunters, but rather solitary creatures that hunted alone or in pairs. Their preferred weapon was the club."
