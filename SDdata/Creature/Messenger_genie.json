Appropriate for their hasty nature, messenger genies were lithe creatures who were constantly on the move. They preferred to wear tighter-fitting clothing than other genies and they seldom wore jewelry of any kind.\nFlight was a messenger genies preferred choice of action when faced with threats. If unable to flee, their quick reflexes often gave them an advantage over their opponents. Their weapons of choice were thrown darts and daggers, which were often coated with a rare paralytic genie poison called bardan ruqad.\nMessenger genies could use the following spell-like abilities aura of comfort, clear path, lighten load, dimensional folding, invisibility, haste, distance distortion, and shadow door.\nMessenger genies rarely stopped moving.

Assaulting a messenger genie was punishable by serving a full century of servitude. To get caught stealing from a messenger genie was certain death.\nThese punctual genies needed little food or water and were capable of working for over a month without rest of any kind. However, after working for this long, they retired to the nearest mountaintop or cloud castle and fell into a deep coma for a week in order to restore their bodies."
