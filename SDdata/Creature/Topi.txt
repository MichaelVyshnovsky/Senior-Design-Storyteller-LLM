A topi was a type of small undead.
A topi was created by shrinking a corpse to two feet tall, and then cutting out its heart and replacing it with a live poisonous snake in a leather bag. The snake would stay alive without food or air, and simultaneously render the topis claws venomous. The snake would die when the topi died.
A significant number of topis resided on the Snout of Omgar, particularly near the ruins of Dangwaru.
