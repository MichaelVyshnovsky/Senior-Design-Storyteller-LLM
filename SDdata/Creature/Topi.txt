A '''topi''' was a type of small [[undead]].

==Creation==
A topi was created by shrinking a corpse to two feet tall, and then cutting out its heart and replacing it with a live [[poison]]ous [[snake]] in a leather bag. The snake would stay alive without food or air, and simultaneously render the topi's claws venomous. The snake would die when the topi died.

==Ecology==
A significant number of topis resided on the [[Snout of Omgar]], particularly near the ruins of [[Dangwaru]].
