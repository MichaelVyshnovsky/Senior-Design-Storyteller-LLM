A jarrlak was a type of demon found within the Abyss.  Jarrlaks were known both for their intelligence and their sadism, and often toyed with their victims, trapping them in blocks of ice.  Jarrlaks often aligned themselves with various demon lords in an effort to acquire power, but they just as often struck out on their own to attempt to establish control over areas of heavy snow and cold. 
Jarrlaks were able to both entomb their enemies in ice as well as raise solid walls of ice.
Jarrlaks attempted to handle enemies one by one, preferring ideally to freeze each one before moving on to the next.
