* A certain species of Amnian hawks had blue-gray backs and bellies with ivory feathering, streaked with dark gray, black, and pale orange. They had a long, square-tipped tail.
* The green kestrel, which despite their name were not true kestrels, were a species of hawk endemic to the Marching Mountains. They were prized by many Calishite falconers for being one of the deadliest birds of prey in the Realms.
