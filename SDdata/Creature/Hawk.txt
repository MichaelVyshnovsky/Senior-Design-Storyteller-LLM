A '''hawk''' was a bird that was distinguished by its excellent vision, even in dark conditions.

{{quote|''The hawk circles and circles, and waits. Against most prey he will have but one strike. He waits therefore for the best chance. Be as the hawk. Watch and wait, and strike true. [[The People]] cannot afford foolish deaths in battle. War to slay, not to fight long and glorious.''|[[Aermhar]] of the [[Tangletrees]], [[1291 DR]]}}

==Species==
* A certain species of '''[[Amn]]ian hawks''' had blue-gray backs and bellies with ivory feathering, streaked with dark gray, black, and pale orange. They had a long, square-tipped tail.
* The '''green kestrel''', which despite their name were not [[Kestrel (bird)|true kestrels]], were a species of hawk endemic to the [[Marching Mountains]]. They were prized by many [[Calishite]] falconers for being one of the deadliest birds of prey in the Realms.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
In the [[Unapproachable East]], hawks could be found around the [[Tannath Gap]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], hawks could be found in the forests of [[Barovia]].
===Relationships===
Some of the best-trained hawks were trained by the [[elf|elven]] [[House Korianthil]].

===Usages===
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold hawk feathers in bundles of four for 1 [[gp]].

Commanders of the [[Igidujin]] tribe of the [[Plain of Horses]] employed hawks trained to attack targets in battle. Their beaks and claws were both sharpened to a razor's edge.

==Notable Hawks==
*[[Silvin]]: The [[animal companion|companion]] of the [[wemic]] [[druid]], [[Kretnor]].{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|4}}
*[[Soliana]], the so-called "Princess of Fanloc" who was a magically ''[[polymorph]]ed'' hawk, given the form of a [[human]] and adopted by the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
