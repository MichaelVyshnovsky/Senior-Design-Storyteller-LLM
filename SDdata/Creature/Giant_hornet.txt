'''Giant hornets''' were aggressive massive mutations of normal-sized [[hornet]]s.

==Description==
Giant hornets were flying carnivorous insects with long bodies, a fell stinger, and an average wingspan of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} or more.

==Behavior==
Giant hornets were solitary but extremely aggressive insects, rarely encountered in groups. They always attacked on sight.

Fire had a weakening effect on these giant insects, and smoke was a repellent.

==Combat==
Giant hornets swooped down on their prey, pinning and holding a victim with their legs while repeatedly stabbing them with their poisonous stinger. The poison in the stinger caused 2–6 hours of paralyzation.

Fortunately, the hornets' buzzing was loud enough to be heard {{SI|150|ft|long=yes}} away in dungeon corridors and from half as far outside, preventing unexpected and stealthy attacks.

==Ecology==
They were carnivorous, just like their normal-sized relatives. Unlike bees, hornets did not lose their stingers and lives after an attack.
===Habitats===
The giant hornets' natural habitats were coniferous forests and, on occasion, underground caves. 

In [[north Faerûn]] giant hornets could be found in [[Thar]], the rimwood area of [[Cormanthor]], the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]], [[Mistledale]], [[Shadowdale]], and around the [[Pool of Yeven]].

Beyond [[Faerun]], giant hornets were known to inhabit various mountains and hills in [[Maztica]]. In [[east Zakhara]], they could be found in the [[Grey Jungle]]. And in the [[Crowded Sea]] south of [[Zakhara]], giant hornets could be found on the [[Djinni's Claws]] and [[Nada al-Hazan]] island chains.
