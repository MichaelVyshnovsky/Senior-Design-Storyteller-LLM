'''Cockroaches''', also known simply as '''roaches''', were crawling [[insect]]s with a reputation as urban pests. They were a common nuisance in the city of [[Calimport]], for example.

==Combat==
Although typically harmless against [[adventurer]]s, cockroach swarms of large enough numbers could pose a serious threat. To those unequipped to handle it, the collective stench of such a group could be overwhelmingly sickening. Damage was typically inflicted by biting, though some swarms were able to eject a corrosive [[acid]] as well.

Particularly diminutive adventurers, such as those shrunk to a tenth of their size per the effects of a version of the ''[[reduce]]'' spell in use between the [[Time of Troubles]] and the [[Year of Wild Magic]], were a more realistic target for individual cockroaches. At this scale, a cockroach's bite could inflict significant damage, and would slow an opponent down for a few seconds.

==Ecology==

Cockroaches could be [[tracking|tracked]] by the pungent smell of their attar and droppings.

[[Beshaba]] counted cockroaches among her [[favored animal]]s, and was known to act through their presence.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10}} [[Torog]], too, favored cockroaches.{{Cite dungeon/177/Deities & Demigods: Torog, the King that Crawls|70}}

===Habitats===
Cockroaches were found in urban areas the [[Shattered Mirror]], and the [[Three Elves]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 23: Cheap and Cheerful at the Three Elves}}

===Related Creatures===
[[Giant cockroach]]es were especially large cockroaches that measured {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in length. Compared to their more common kin, they were considerably more belligerent, attacking just about anything animate.

[[Vfush Sweetwaterlake]], a [[slyth]] scholar of insects and [[arachnid]]s, claimed to have observed an undead species of cockroach.{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Dungeons|4}}

A rare subset of cockroaches were valued for their use in detecting magic, as their shells turned blue in its presence. These cockroaches were sold in the markets of [[Vaelan]].

Some sages postulated that [[hook horror]]s were distant relatives of cockroaches.

==History==
Prior to becoming an advisor at the [[Citadel of Assassins]], the archmage [[Knellict]] survived an assassination attempt organized by his prior employer, [[Zhengyi]] the Witch-King, by [[polymorph]]ing his assailants into cockroaches. Similarly, during her tumultuous tenure as guildmaster of the [[Welcomers]] of [[Phlan]], the [[half-fiend]] [[Sirana]] used this same maneuver on several of her own guildmembers.

==Trivia==
The [[hishna]] spell ''[[pestilence]]'' brought forth a mass of crawling insects, among which were cockroaches.
