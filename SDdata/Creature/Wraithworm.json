        "mainbody": "'''Wraithworms''' were a [[magical beast|magical]], [[outsider|planar species]] of [[snake]] with an unexplained connection to the [[undead]].",
        "Description": "These serpents had large, powerful bodies measuring {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length, but were rather slow and lethargic. Their heads were nearly [[human]] in size, with fangs measuring {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} in length, and they had glowing eyes. Their scales had a coal-black and bright green coloration, as well as dark purple bands that ran down the center of their back in a diamond pattern.\n\nThe spine of a wraithworm featured sharp, bony spikes that jutted through the scales of its back. However, these were simply a deterrent and were not utilized offensively by wraithworms.",
        "Behavior": "Wraithworms possessed a level of intellect comparable to most animals.",
        "Abilities": "These creatures possessed a number of innate abilities that mimicked powers commonly found in undead creatures. These included their ability to assume a ''[[wraithform]]'' only harmable by ''+1'' or better weapons, their partial immunity to harm from cold and [[negative energy]], and their bite drained living creatures of their life force. The intense, bitter cold feeling imparted by their powerful, slow-working venom was also suggestive of this. In addition, if a [[priest]] were to cast ''[[turn undead]]'', it would render a wraithworm motionless for one to three minutes.\n\nBeyond those undead-like traits, while tangible a wraithworm could paralyze weak creatures within {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} of them with their gaze. However, wraithworms had to focus their attention while doing so.",
        "Combat": "Due to their slow movements, wraithworms relied upon stealth while hunting. They often utilized their ''wraithform'' to sneak upon on prey or make an escape. Whenever they got within striking range of a creature, wraithworms briefly moved with a blinding speed.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Wraithworms were a carnivorous species, commonly preying upon [[bird]]s and other small animals. It was fairly rare for them to ever attack humans out of hunger.",
            "Habitats": "The preferred habitats of wraithworms were deserts, rocky wastes, and barren badlands. They were commonly found in the [[plane]] of [[Carceri]] on the layer of [[Minethys]] and the plane of [[Arborea]] on its desert layer [[Pelion]].",
            "Relationships": "Wraithworms typically avoided humans. On ocassions when they did strike at them, it was due to the human having gotten too close for the serpent's comfort.\n\nIn terms of the [[deities]] worshiped on [[Toril]], wraithworms were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of [[Sseth]] and the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi deity]] [[Thoth]].<ref>"
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "How the wraithworms came to possess their undead-like characteristics was a matter of debate among planar sages. One of the two most widely accepted theories, one was that long-term exposure to the strange energies and [[magic]]s of the [[Outer Planes]] had caused some mundane serpents to develop into them. The other most widely accepted theory was that some greater [[fiend]] or an [[evil]] deity had created them to be so for either their own purposes or their amusement."
