        "mainbody": "Blue ring octopi were a species of sentient octopus found in the Underdark.\nBlue ring octopi looked like a regular octopi but much larger. Their tentacles could grow to up to  in length. Their eyes were large and golden-hued and their beaks were a greenish-brown. Their skin was covered in hundreds of small blue circles.\nSome blue ring octopi were born with rings of deep oxblood red and grew to be even larger than others of their species. They were known as red shamans or shaman blue rings.\nDespite their size, blue ring octopi were shy creatures. They were highly intelligent and good-natured and were committed pacifists..\nLike most octopi, the skin of a blue ring octopus was saturated with chromatophores. This gave the blue ring octopus excellent camouflage. They could vary the color of their skin from a dirty gray to a dark gray-brown.\nIn fact, its camouflaged was so effective that it was capable of altering how light was reflected off its skin. This provided a blue ring octopus with camouflage against creatures who used infravision or ultravision to see.\nRed shamans lacked this ability but were capable of casting powerful divine spells.\nBlue ring octopi avoided combat when possible, preferring to evade a potentially hostile creatures. However, if forced into combat, blue ring octopi were fierce fighters. In melee combat, they used their powerful tentacles, which were poisonous, to grab and then constrict an opponent. Blue ring octopi released a poisonous cloud of ink as a defensive measure. It released enough ink to fill a sphere with a  radius. The poison affected any water-breathing creature as well as any creature using magic to breath water.\nRed shamans were the priests of blue ring octopi society. They were considered wise by other blue ring octopi and provided advice to their tribes. It was not known what, if any, deity they worshiped to acquire their divine powers.\nThey were known to make intricate carvings out of coral and exchanged these with friendly sea-dwellers.\nBlue ring octopi were nomadic and lived together in small tribes within the oceans of the Underdark. Occasionally they found a passage to the bottom of a surface ocean, where they lived in the dark, cold waters of the ocean depths. They made their homes in cracks and crevices in the seabed and tried to avoid detection by the more dangerous creatures of the oceans.\nBlue ring octopi maintained an underwater realm called Suswynfa within the waters of the Giants Chalice, a subterranean lake below the Western Heartlands.\nBlue ring octopi had a co-operative relationship with locathah and tako. Those of Suswynfa traded and had allies in the sea elf realm of Naramyr.\nAboleths and kuo-toa were known to capture blue ring octopi to use them as slaves. Enslaved blue ring octopi were usually treated well. Blue ring octopi had the uncanny ability to know when another one of their species were being held as slaves, and used whatever means necessary to free them."
