        "mainbody": "An '''elder brain''' was the final stage of the [[mind flayer]] life cycle. The elder brain lived in a brine-filled pool in the center of a mind flayer city, where it guided its community by filling them with dark dreams of [[illithid]] domination.",
        "Description": "The elder brain's strong mind-affecting powers stemmed from the brains of long-dead mind flayers making up its viscous mass. Being composed of many brains as energy source for its intellect, it could communicate telepathically with any creature within a distance of {{SI|350|ft|long=yes}} and sense the presence of any sentient creature within {{SI|5|mi|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "{{Quote|Brawn is no match for our cosmic intellect!|[[Zuphelithid]] the elder brain.}}\n\nAlthough its intellect was of godlike proportions, its only physical attack was by using its tendrils to lash out at or grapple an opponent. Therefore, mind flayers protected their elder brain by securing it in a well-protected cave inside the city.\n\nAn elder brain could quickly cast [[spell]]s at the same time as it used its tendrils to attack. It usually started combat with a powerful [[mind blast]]. It could then use many [[psionic]] attacks such as [[charm]] and [[domination]] abilities. On top of those, it could cast spells as an extremely powerful [[sorcerer]], making it an opponent to be feared.\n\nThe elder brain could then use its tentacles to lash out against opponents, usually those paralyzed by its psionic attacks.",
        "Society": "[[File:Volobrain.png|thumb||right|270px|''An elder brain being transported.'']]\nForming the physical and spiritual center of a mind flayer community, the elder brain served as a living library of the community's history, technology, and knowledge. Playing this important role in a mind flayer society, it often doubled as an advisor in all sorts of political and military decisions, operating as the community's effective leader.\n\nAn elder brain marked also the ultimate goal in every mind flayer's life when it neared the end of its lifespan. Mind flayers sacrificed their brain and individual life by merging with the elder brain, strengthening its powers and intellect. The average mind flayer was unaware that their personality and consciousness were lost when joining with the elder brain, and only their knowledge and ideas survived. This was a fiercely guarded secret kept by the elder brains.",
        "Notable Elder Brains": "* [[Encephalithid]], the elder brain of [[Oryndoll]] in the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n* [[Ioulaum]], a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] transformed into an [[undead]] elder brain after the fall of [[Netheril]].\n* [[Yshiggol]], an elder brain imprisoned in the [[Dread Vault]].\n* [[Zuphelithid]], the elder brain who enslaved a community of deep gnomes near the ruins of [[Dolblunde]].\n* [[The Absolute]], an elder brain enslaved by the [[Chosen]] of the [[Dead Three]] to form the [[Cult of the Absolute]] and act as its deity, granting them the power to raise an army of illithids and telepathic cultists to conquer the Sword Coast on their behalf.<ref> The [[Netheril|Netherese]] magic of the [[Crown of Karsus]] greatly enlarged and empowered the Absolute, such that it became an entirely new kind of brain, referred to as a ''Netherbrain''."
