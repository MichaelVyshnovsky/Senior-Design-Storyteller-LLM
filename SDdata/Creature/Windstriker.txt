'''Windstrikers''' were a variety of [[elemental air|air]] [[elemental]] that inhabited the [[Elemental Chaos]].

==Description==
These elementals resembled a whirlwind, with long gaunt claws jutting out from its central vortex.

==Combat==
These elementals using their whirling bodies to inflict freezing cold and thunderous sound upon their enemies. They always focused upon a single targeting, confident that they can defend against any other attackers that may come their way.

==Society==
These elementals typically fought alongside their own kind or other creatures that dwelled in the [[Elemental Chaos]], such as [[shardstorm vortex|shardstorm vortices]]. In the [[Prime Material plane]], they were sometimes summoned by powerful [[magic]] and instructed to guard tombs or treasure-houses.
