Windstrikers were a variety of air elemental that inhabited the Elemental Chaos.
These elementals resembled a whirlwind, with long gaunt claws jutting out from its central vortex.
These elementals using their whirling bodies to inflict freezing cold and thunderous sound upon their enemies. They always focused upon a single targeting, confident that they can defend against any other attackers that may come their way.
These elementals typically fought alongside their own kind or other creatures that dwelled in the Elemental Chaos, such as shardstorm vortices. In the Prime Material plane, they were sometimes summoned by powerful magic and instructed to guard tombs or treasure-houses.
