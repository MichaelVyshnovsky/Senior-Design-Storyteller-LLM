They protected its natural locals as well as each of the lodge-houses belonging to the various berserker lodges.\nEach telthor took a form befitting the site or location is protected.\nThey were closely connected to the spirit magic that permeated the landscape Rashemen. If an individual died protecting that land, their spirit could manifest as a humanoid telthor. That telthor would then watch over the area in which they lost their mortal life.\nThey possessed an inherent empathetic connection with other animals and other telthors.\nA telthor would experience physical harm if it traveled more than one mile (1.6 kilometers) away from the land it protected.\n* Okku The great bear spirit was said to have descended from a sleuth of bears associated with Bhalla."
