Giragonnes were magical hybrids of giraffes and copper dragons. These creatures were natural comedians, and were always looking for an audience.
Giragonnes combined traits of their component creatures, featuring the long neck and spindly legs of a giraffe, and the draconic head and wings of a copper dragon. Although it stood  tall, its torso was not much larger than that of a draft horse.
Giragonnes rarely engaged in combat, preferring to defuse a situation or incapacitate assailants using their natural ability to cast Ottos irresistible dance, grease, Tashas hideous laughter, and baleful transposition, as well as their adhesive, thick spittle. If forced into a fight, giragonnes were able to deliver a powerful kick with their hind legs.
Although giragonnes were sociable with other species, they generally didnt seek out the companionship of their kin.
Giragonne lairs were filled with objects the creatures deemed comedic, including books and scrolls filled with jokes.
Giragonnes laired mostly in the Shaar and Aunorach, though they lived throughout desert and savannah areas.
Legend had it that these creatures were created by a humorous wizard with a passion for crossbreeding magical creatures.
