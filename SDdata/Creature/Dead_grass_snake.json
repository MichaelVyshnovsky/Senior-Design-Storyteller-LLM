        "mainbody": "Dead grass snakes were a rare species of venomous snake.\nAs their name suggests, these snakes looked like a blade of dead grass. They were about  long.\nDead grass snakes lived in the temperate grasslands of Pelleors Prairie in the Western Heartlands. They were quite rare such that some inhabitants of the region might never encounter one.\nTaking advantage of their natural camouflage, dead grass snakes waited for prey to pass near them and then struck with their venomous bite. While the venom was potent enough to kill a small animal such as a rabbit, it was not fatal to larger creatures. Even so, a bitten humanoid could expect to be doubled over with debilitating body pains, fever, and nausea, which set in within a few minutes and could last for a few days as the poison worked its way out of their system. Diamond cure was recommended as a treatment for the effects of the poison."
