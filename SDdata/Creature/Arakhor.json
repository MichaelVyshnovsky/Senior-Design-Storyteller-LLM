        "mainbody": "n arakhor (, an arakhor was summoned by the elves of Aryvandaar to guard the location of the Hall of Mists in the High Forest, for fear of the evil inside. Over the following millennia, it grew and became known as the Grandfather Tree, still standing over the site. Records made by the church of Labelas Enoreth at this time postulated arakhora were elder treants.\nBy the mid–14 century DR, the Grandfather Tree and a cutting at Stone Stand were the last surviving arakhora known to exist in Faerûn."
