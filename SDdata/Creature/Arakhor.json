Arakhora were possibly an elder form of [[treant]], or even ancestors of that race.''Serpent Kingdoms'' advises to treat an arakhor as an advanced elder treant from ''Epic Level Handbook'', and those stats are used for this article, but it is not necessarily the case that an arakhor is an elder treant.",
        "Abilities": "Similar to [[elemental]]s in certain aspects, arakhora absorbed energy, life, and even intelligence from the forests that they lived in and in exchange served as caretakers and guardians of the land.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-12500}}, an arakhor was summoned by the [[elves]] of [[Aryvandaar]] to guard the location of the [[Hall of Mists]] in the [[High Forest]], for fear of the evil inside. Over the following millennia, it grew and became known as the [[Grandfather Tree]], still standing over the site. Records made by the [[church of Labelas Enoreth]] at this time postulated arakhora were elder treants.\n\nBy the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Grandfather Tree and a cutting at [[Stone Stand]] were the last surviving arakhora known to exist in [[Faerûn]]."
