        "Combat": "The berbalang used its ability to fly to give it an advantage during combat. It used its claws and teeth as weapons. Its projection was immune to charm, hold, and sleep spells. The projection would attempt to flee combat if it was struck. If the projection was killed, it was likely that the physical body would also be slain.",
