        "mainbody": "'''Galeb duhr''' ({{SingPl|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) were magical creatures of stone that appeared almost like animated boulders, with the power to control the rocks around them.",
        "Description": {
            "Personality": "Galeb duhr were slow to think and slow to act, yet they were very intelligent creatures. They tended to be very territorial and rarely shared knowledge of their rocky homes with strangers. To question them about such knowledge would likely irritate them. In truth, they did in fact know just about anything one might want to know about their mountain homes. However, despite their territoriality they were not opposed to allying with those of like mind, such as [[pech]] or [[treant]]s in wooded mountain ranges.<ref>{{Cite dragon/172/The Ecology of the Galeb Duhr|24}}\n\nGaleb duhr felt a responsibility to \"tend\" the smaller boulders and rocks around them, much like a treant tended trees.",
            "Abilities": "Similar to how treants had an innate power over trees, so galeb duhr had control over the stone around them. They could magically [[move earth]], [[Stone shape|shape stone]], [[Passwall|create openings in stone]], and [[Transmute rock to mud|turn rocks into mud]]. They could also create a [[wall of stone]] with their magic. Beyond these powers, they could also animate a number of boulders around them. These abilities were not spells; a galeb duhr simply had to will for them to happen.\n\nIt was rumored that especially old galeb duhr or those living in mountainous places with a strong connection to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] had powers over stone even greater than these.\n\nA galeb duhr could sense motions through the ground of approaching creatures or objects.",
            "Biology": "Like other [[elemental creature]]s, Galeb duhr neither slept nor breathed. Some reported that galeb duhr ate rock, preferring granite and not liking the taste of sedimentary rock, and that they only needed to eat once every two or three months. This was in fact not true. Galeb duhr gained nutrients simply from being in contact with their rocky environment. They grew from drawing sustenance from the element [[Earth (element)|earth]] much like a plant grows by drawing sustenance in some sense from the sun.\n\nBecause of this source of sustenance for a galeb duhr, a galeb duhr removed from a stony, mountainous environment would grow weaker and eventually die. An exceptionally weakened galeb duhr would begin to lose its powers over other stones. A dead galeb duhr was nothing more than a normal boulder.\n\nA galeb duhr had no internal organs at all. They were simply made from solid rock. When it died, the parts of its body were indistinguishable from other rock.\n\nGaleb duhr were extremely long-lived. Some could last for many thousands of years. If a galeb duhr died of natural causes, it would crack and break apart slowly over several days.\n\nIt was a mystery to most how galeb duhr reproduced. Some suggested that they could only originate on the Plane of Earth and travel to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. However, smaller galeb duhr had been observed, which were assumed to be young ones.\n\nIn truth, galeb duhr were genderless and reproduced asexually. When a galeb duhr died of old age, three smaller boulders would be left behind. These small boulders would incubate for 100 years before becoming animate as young galeb duhr adults. The largest galeb duhr would generally take control of the immediate territory while its \"siblings\" would migrate to find new homes. Rarely, they would share territory together.\n\nStone fragments that were once a part of a galeb duhr's body provided an extra level of magical power to those spells that required stone as a material component. Only a single usage of a galeb duhr fragment would consume it, and such a fragment only contained this additional earth power for about a month before the fragment would behave just as any other stone."
        },
        "Combat": "While they had no natural enemies, sometimes creatures would try to steal gems from the galeb duhr, and sometimes intruders would disturb the galeb duhr's rocks&mdash;to their own peril.\n\nA galeb duhr would typically avoid combat by vanishing into the ground by burrowing or through magic, or by simply not moving and appearing just like its surrounding rock. If annoyed by an intruder, however, a galeb duhr could be a powerful opponent, and would not hesitate to fight using its powerful control of the element of earth. They could also pummel an enemy with their rocky appendages, bite, or roll at them.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Galeb duhr spoke [[Terran]], and some were reported to speak [[Giant language|Giant]] and [[Dwarven]].",
            "Philosophy": "Galeb duhr did not seem to have a religion, per se, but they believed in what they called \"earth power\". In places of stone and rock, galeb duhr felt stronger. It was theorized that this was because of a greater connection to the Plane of Earth in such places. This earth power was what gave the galeb duhr their impressive magical abilities. Younger mountains, less ravaged by the effects of [[air]] or [[water]] were most likely to have the strongest connections to the Plane of Earth, and thus, galeb duhr preferred living in such places."
        },
        "History": "Some scholars, particularly those living after the [[Spellplague]], theorized that the galeb duhr were once [[Dwarf|dwarves]] enslaved to [[giant]]s and [[titan]]s, some of which eventually escaped this enslavement.\n\nThere seems little support for this theory, however, and most scholars believed that the galeb duhr were native to the Plane of Earth. Many galeb duhr were magically called to the Material Plane by spellcasters (most often [[wizard]]s and [[druid]]s) due to their talents as guardians, while others would form naturally in places where the Plane of Earth touched the Material Plane.\n\nIn [[1085 DR]], the galeb duhr of [[Tannath]] and [[Undergoth]] erected the great [[Watchwall]] of [[Aglarond]].\n\nIn [[1362 DR]] two galeb duhr were standing guard at the entrance to [[Thayvian gold mines]].\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], the treants of [[Turlang]] and a large number of galeb duhr caused a great landslide to block [[Turnstone Pass]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}",
