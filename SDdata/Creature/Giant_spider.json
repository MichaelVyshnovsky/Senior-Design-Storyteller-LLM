        "mainbody": "Giant spiders, also known as monstrous spiders, were quite simply enormous versions of regular spiders. Existing in various types, there was no way to singularly describe their appearance with various types ranging in size from that of a dog to a house. Giant versions of tarantulas existed, as did black widows, spitters, spinners, and all manner of others. Their appearances, habits, and environments all varied greatly. Goblins were known to employ them as mounts.\nDue to the different types of such spiders, they varied largely in all ways, such as having different colors and behavior. Lolth, the Queen of Spiders, was bound to have giant spiders serving her.\nGiant spiders could attack in a variety of ways, typically whatever way their normal counterparts could. Some spun huge webs that prey easily stumbled into, while others spat a deadly poison. Some were capable of walking on ceilings, while others were not. Despite the differences between the types of giant spiders, all were formidable opponents and certainly not foes for any arachnophobes to face.\nthumb|Prey of giant spiders, cocooned in giant spider silk.\nGiant spiders viscera was iridescent gold and purple in color.

Unlike natural giant spiders, the ones created by this spell carried a nonfatal venom that only stunned its victims, even if the spider it was created from had a poisonous bite. They were also unable to produce webs, but had great ease in navigating the artificial ones created by the spells web and spellweb. By 1372 DR, the spiderform spell had changed so as to allow these creatures access to these standard spider abilities.\nSwarmhorde A relatively small species of giant spiders that lived in the Underdark beneath Kings Forest.\nWater A common species of giant spiders that were adapted to surviving in aquatic environments.\n* Demons of the Samarlogh - A band of massive and fiercely intelligent fiendish giant spiders of the Samarlogh jungles.\n* Pet of Kalistes - A very intelligent and exceptionally powerful giant spider created by the marilith Kalistes."
