        "mainbody": "'''Giant spiders''', also known as '''monstrous spiders''', were quite simply enormous versions of regular [[spider]]s. Existing in various types, there was no way to singularly describe their appearance; with various types ranging in size from that of a [[dog]] to a house. Giant versions of [[tarantula]]s existed, as did [[black widow]]s, spitters, spinners, and all manner of others. Their appearances, habits, and environments all varied greatly. [[Goblin]]s were known to employ them as mounts.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Due to the different types of such spiders, they varied largely in all ways, such as having different colors and behavior. [[Lolth]], the Queen of Spiders, was bound to have giant spiders serving her.",
        "Combat": "Giant spiders could attack in a variety of ways, typically whatever way their normal counterparts could. Some spun huge webs that prey easily stumbled into, while others spat a deadly poison. Some were capable of walking on ceilings, while others were not. Despite the differences between the types of giant spiders, all were formidable opponents and certainly not foes for any arachnophobes to face.",
        "Ability": "[[File:Giant spider silk bg3.png|thumb|''Prey of giant spiders, cocooned in giant [[spider silk]].'']]\nGiant spiders' viscera was iridescent gold and purple in color. If it came in contact with a [[humanoid]]'s skin, it had a burning and irritating effect, leaving skin enflamed with red splotches, however, it was mostly harmless.",
        "Species": {
            "Giant flying spider|Flying": "Categorized as a type of [[subterranean spider]], this species were much larger cousins of [[flying spider]]s.",
            "Gaze spider|Gaze": "A magical species of giant spiders that had the power to attack with a paralyzing gaze.",
            "Ice spider|Ice": "A species of giant spider that were adapted to living in arctic and freezing cold environments. They had a natural resistance to cold-based attacks and weaved liquid webs that quickly solidified due to their environment.",
            "Giant marine spider|Marine": "A species of giant spiders that were adapted to surviving in saltwater environments.",
            "Spiderform": "An artificial species that was created whenever the [[spell]] ''[[spiderform]]'' was cast on either a mundane arachnid or any other species of small animal. Unlike natural giant spiders, the ones created by this spell carried a nonfatal venom that only stunned its victims, even if the spider it was created from had a poisonous bite. They were also unable to produce webs, but had great ease in navigating the artificial ones created by the spells ''[[web]]'' and ''[[spellweb]]''.<ref> By [[1372 DR]], the ''spiderform'' spell had changed so as to allow these creatures access to these standard spider abilities.",
            "Swarmhorde spider|Swarmhorde": "A relatively small species of giant spiders that lived in the [[Underdark]] beneath [[King's Forest]].",
