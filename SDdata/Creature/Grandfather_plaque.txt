A '''grandfather plaque''' was a type of small, [[gargoyle|guardian gargoyle]] in the Realms, created for the purpose of acting as a door guardian.

==Description==
All grandfather plaques were immobile [[construct]]s, lacking any sort of limbs, being that they were designed to be attached to the stone lintel of a door. Their bodies consisted entirely of a bas relief of a [[human]] face, depicted with strong, dignified features. On average they measured around {{SIrange|1|2|ft|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
All grandfather plaques possessed an average level of intellect, comparable to that of a human,{{Cite dragon/223/The Dragon's Bestiary: Four guardian gargoyles|23}} Their focus was so narrow that they seldom interacted with other creatures unless a response was needed.

However, whenever a grandfather plaque's building fell into ruin and abandonment, it would engage in conversation with other intelligent creatures, imploring them to either repair the structure or remove them from their lintel and install them elsewhere on a door of a structure that was in active use. They would often, in return, offer all the treasures that had accumulated over the years from previous trespassers.

==Abilities==
These constructs possessed a limited form of telepathy, allowing them to mentally converse with a single person whom was designated at the time of their creation. They also had the power to ''[[wizard lock]]'' the doors they were attached to, allowing them to open and close them at will.

Grandfather plaques were imbued with three [[spell]]-like powers to defend themselves and their charges. Firstly, they could shoot ''[[magic missile]]s'' from their eyes. They could ''[[shout]]'' at intruders, as per the [[wizard]] spell. And anyone who touched either them or their door without permission would find themselves weakened, as if they were the victim of a ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]''. Additionally, they could only be harmed by weapons that had a ''+1 or greater'' [[enchantment]].

==Society==
Grandfather plaques were solitary constructs, never being placed on doors in pairs. If ever a complex had more than one grandfather plaque as part of its security, they would always be found on separate on doors.

==Notable Grandfather Plaques==
* Grandfather plagues were among the specialized stone monsters that guarded the lair of the [[blue dragon]] [[Iymrith]].{{Cite dragon/242/Wyrms of the North: Iymrith|56}}
* The [[Sleepy Dwarf Tavern]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] had a grandfather plaque installed on the stairwell door leading to its second floor. Anyone who attempted to pass through its door would be directed to first check-in with [[Mary Grace]] at the Guests Relations podium.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Going Home|7}}
* In [[the Vast]], the [[Raven's estate|manor house]] of the [[wizard]] [[Raven (wizard)|Raven]] had a cemetary that included a tomb for the Warlord [[Hastigor]] whose doors were guarded by a grandfather plaque with a bearded visage.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Dawn's Early Light|10}}
* Within the burial vaults of the [[Uthtower]], the nobility of the kingdom of Uthtower had a grandfather plaque in the likeness of their own face installed on the stone alcove of their burial niche. Beneath each of these grandfather plaques was an inscription, detailing the name of the person interred as well as their birth and death dates, enumerated in [[Uth Reckoning]]. Some were additionally inscribed with a rather cryptic message. If these plaques were addressed or touched in any fashion, they would incite the inscription in an archaic dialect of [[Common]].
