Their faces were bare and elongated into a muzzle.\nGambols were fiercely territorial creatures that would attack anything entering their claimed area on sight. They constantly prowled their territory to ensure its security.\nGambols were ferocious when engaged in combat. They used their impressive reach to claw and bite their targets. Ranged attacks on gambols were difficult since they never stopped moving. Their innate agility made it easy for them to dodge incoming attacks as well.\nThese creatures were capably of blasting out a terrifying howl that would cause most creatures within  to panic for several minutes. Creatures could only fall victim to this sonic attack once per day.\nGambols could cover distances quickly by dashing, climbing, or leaping.\nGambols were carnivorous creatures that considered anything smaller than themselves to be a prey item.\nGambols were present on the Chultan Peninsula, prowling the stretch of the Black Jungles that pressed through the Dolsel Gap in to western Thindol."
