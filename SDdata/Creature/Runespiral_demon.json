They typically circled the peripheries of fights, drawing on their magical blasts to attack enemies. Relatively unintelligent, they were often conscripted by other demons with a mixture of threats and promises of carnage.\nRunespiral demons who specifically channeled lightning energy were often called arctide runespiral demons or arctide spiraliths and were larger and more intelligent than their more common kin. Other forms, channeling other energies, were also known such forms could be differentiated by the patterns of runes on their shells."
