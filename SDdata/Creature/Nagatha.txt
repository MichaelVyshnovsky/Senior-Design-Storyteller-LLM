'''Nagathas''' were tortured, wormlike creatures created by [[spirit naga]]s as servitors.

==Description==
Nagathas were wormlike creatures with humanoid torsos and arms that ended in twisted, clawed hands, and a vaguely viper-like head. They were typically {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} long and weighed between {{SIrange|150|250|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Nagathas felt a constant emptiness within them, a painful emotional echo and a sense that something important to them was lost forever. The only solace they found was either in commiserating with other nagathas, or when fighting, since battle let them focus their pain and confusion in a somewhat cathartic fury. However, nagathas were also utterly loyal to the spirit naga that created them. They were also utter sadists.

==Abilities==
Nagathas were not particularly powerful or smart creatures, but they were persistent and loyal to their masters. They could move very fast when they wanted to, however, and were capable of burrowing through the ground. Perhaps their greatest weakness was that nagathas were completely blind and instead relied on their keen hearing to detect any creatures within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of them.

==Combat==
Nagathas typically either guarded entryways or patrolled areas in the service of their spirit naga master. In both cases, they preferred to burrow underground to avoid attack and surprise foes; when patrolling, they would spread out so that they could more efficiently cover an area. When they fought alongside their master, nagathas engaged in melee to keep any and all enemies away from the spellcasting naga.

==Ecology==
[[File:Nagatha 3e.png|thumb|''A nagatha preparing to strike.'']]
No nagatha started life as a nagatha: they were created by spirit nagas from medium-sized humanoids in a process that was both cruel and horrific, stripping away their free will, memories, and abilities. Their legs were fused together into a worm-like mass and their arms were twisted into claws that made wielding weapons impossible. The worst part of the transformation was to the mind, which spirit nagas dulled to prevent any arcane spellcasting even as they erased the nagatha's memories of any prior existence, and wove a ''[[charm person]]'' spell throughout the procedure that was responsible for the nagatha's loyalty.

Even worse, the spirit nagas deliberately left the emotional pain and sense of loss all nagathas felt, cultivating it and taking care afterwards to express a measure of understanding and sympathy. Nagathas consequently looked to their "parents" for a sense of purpose, and reacted to any suggestion that their master might be responsible for their pain with rage.

Nagathas were always found near spirit nagas, which was normally in temperate marshes, unless their master had been killed. On Toril, spirit nagas and their nagatha servitors were known to live in the caves along the [[Nagaflow]] in the [[Nagaland]] in [[Chondath]] and [[Sespech]], and in [[Najara]].
