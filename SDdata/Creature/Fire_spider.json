        "mainbody": "'''Fire spiders''' were a species of [[spider]] infused with [[elemental fire]] that were native to [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 601: Conflagratum|Conflagratum, the 601{{st}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]].",
        "Description": "These diminutive spiders had bodies black like [[coal]], laced with streaks of magma and legs that were wholly made of [[Arcane magic|arcane]] fire.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures operated in hive minds and delighted in setting things aflame. When set loose in an area they would focus their attention on the most combustible of objects.",
        "Abilities": "Any combustible material that made contact with a fire spider would be set aflame, including living creatures, thus fire spiders could easily cause rapidly spreading conflagrations. Their fangs were also [[poison|venomous]].\n\nAs befitting their fiery nature, fire spiders were very vulnerable to cold. And due to operating as a hive mind, swarms of them were very suspectible to mind-affecting [[spell]]s and abilities.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Feuerspinnen.jpg|thumb|273px|''Fire spiders swarm over their next victim.'']]\nMultiple swarms of these creatures would work in concert with one another, isolating their prey by encircling them with rings of fire.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-2439}}, fire spiders arrived on the [[Prime Material plane]] for the first time when a group of [[Maerimydra]]n [[drow]] spellcasters based in the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] summoned them to set large parts of the southern [[Rystall Wood]]s on fire, separating it from its northern reaches, an area that would later become known as the [[Border Forest]]. In later centuries, drow would continue to occasionally summon fire spiders in order to set things aflame.\n\nIn the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]], during the [[Zhentarim]] invasion of [[Shadowdale]], a drow named [[Xullrae Dhuurniv]] summoned a swarm of these spiders on to the Prime Material plane in an effort to set the forest of [[Cormanthor]] aflame.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Though they originated in the Conflagratum, fire spiders later spread to many other fiery regions of the Abyss. And following their summoning to the Prime Material in -2439 DR, reports suggested that they could occasionally be encountered within the [[Deep Wastes]].\n\nOn the Prime Material plane, fire spiders rarely survived or propagated outside of areas in temperate regions that were rich with prey and combustible material, such as forests."
        },
        "Trivia": "These spiders could be summoned by spellcasters through use of the spell ''[[fire spiders]]''."
