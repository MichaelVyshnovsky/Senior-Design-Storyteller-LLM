        "mainbody": "A sketkah was a specific type of serpent that dwelt in the Marsh of Chelimber.\nThese serpents were venomous. Reputedly, their venom could be squeezed from them and combined with magic. When used, all one spoke was understood by all who could hear them.\nIn 1374 DR, the lizardfolk Sleyvas claimed to use the venom of the sketkah to communicate with and understand the three adventurers, Kromlech Bruenghor, Vahn, and Adrianna. However, as he later deceived the adventurers, it is possible that the things he told them were not true."
