'''Green abishai''' were the middle-class of the [[abishai]] [[devil]]s. Like their [[true dragon]] counterparts, the [[green dragon]]s, they were [[poison]]ous creatures that had mastered the art of manipulation. 
 
==Personality==
Green abishai were the most charismatic of abishai, able to subtly misdirect and manipulate even the shrewd and suspicious whether with skill or sorcery. Their own keen senses, allowed them to find useful secrets and other pieces of important information.

==Abilities==
Green abishai had access to a variety of mind-manipulating [[spell]]s such as ''[[mass suggestion]]'' and ''[[detect thoughts]]''. They also had a strength-sapping poison in their tail stingers and claws. They could summon a small group of [[lemure]]s or attempt to call upon green or [[black abishai]] to aid them.

==Combat==
Green abishai were known to use [[longsword]]s, as well as special polearms called [[guisarme-voulge]]s.

==Society==
Green abishais were the representatives of [[Tiamat]], whether within the [[Nine Hells]] or outside of it. They were both the diplomats and envoys of her infernal armies.
