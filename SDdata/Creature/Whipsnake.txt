Whipsnakes were a species of constrictor snake.
Whipsnakes were smaller and thinner than most constrictor snakes. Their scales were brown and speckled with patches of black and green.
Whipsnakes usually attacked prey by dropping onto them from a tree. Occasionally they attacked from the ground, laying still among the detritus on the ground. Appearing as tree branch, they ambushed their prey when they walked by unawares, tripping them by coiling around their targets legs. The whipsnake then bit into their prey, using their fangs as an anchor, and began wrapping their body around their prey. 
Whipsnakes were native to the warm marshes of the Serpent Hills. Their range has slowly spread to the surrounding regions. 
Whipsnakes were capable swimmers.
Whipsnake scales were used as a resilient fabric. Whipsnake scales did not dry out and were used as a cover for items and clothing. It was usually decorated by applying oil and paint to the scales and then baked. The heat baked the vibrant colors into the scales.
