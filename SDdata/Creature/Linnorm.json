        "mainbody": "Linnorms were a very rare, primeval breed of dragon-related creatures.\nLinnorms had immense bodies that were snake-like, lacking both wings and rear limbs. Their bodies could grow to be as large as  and weigh as much as .\nThese creatures had flexible skeletons, containing hundreds of vertebrae, and grew large trunk muscles that allowed them to dig into the ground with the scales of their underbelly and by pushing forward with their ribs. Their forelegs ended in sharp, razor-like claws.\nThese creatures were typically known to be cruel, hateful, and very spiteful. They were infamously untrustworthy, rarely honoring bargains.\nThey were fiercely territorial. Unlike some draconic creatures, not all linnorms were known to be avaricious. The oldest of linnorms typically suffered from some form of insanity due to their isolative nature.\nMuch like the more common breeds of dragon, linnorms possessed varying forms of dragon breath. They also were immune to magical effects that induced sleep or paralysis.In 2nd edition, the non-unique races of linnorm dragons progressed through the usual twelve age categories of true dragons.\nLinnorms had keen visual senses, possessing both a form of blindsight and darkvision.\nWhen engaging in combat a linnorm relied upon their dragon breath and immense strength, attempting to crush their opponents and swipe them with their tails. Being brilliant tacticians and strategists, linnorms studied their foes from afar and formed plans of attack, made a quick and decisive attack.\nthumb|250px|right|A stygian linnorm on the banks of the Styx.\n* Corpse tearer The most feared of all linnorms, these creatures were believed to be direct descendants of the legendary Nidhogg.\n* Dread linnorm The largest variety of linnorm,\n* Flame linnorm\n* Forest linnorm\n* Frost linnorm\n* Gray linnorm The smallest and most aggressive variety of linnorm.\n* Land linnorm\n* Rain linnorm\n* Sea linnorm\n* Stygian linnorm A variety of linnorm that was native to the Styx.\n* Swamp linnorm\nSome believed that all linnorms were the bastard offspring of a legendary, serpent-like creature known as Nidhogg. Other scholars speculated that linnorms originated from Niflheim.\nSome scholars believed that linnorms were lesser serpents that evolved from a common ancestor of all dragons.\nDue to their single-mindedness, usually refusing to ally themselves with any other living creature. Whenever they did ally with someone, a linnorm would typically turn upon them after they achieved their goals.\nOnce every decade female linnorms would release pheromones that were tuned to the heightened senses of male linnorms, though this call to mate went unanswered more often than not. While mating these creatures entangled their long bodies around one another, forming a sort of \"mating ball.\" The resulting clutch of eggs would be cared for by the female until they hatched, at which point they would be abandoned. Gray linnorms were the exception to this, remaining with their hatchlings until they could fend for themselves.\nThese creatures lived inside deep tunnels, which they outfitted with elaborate traps.\nLinnorms infested some of the thinner and lower branches of Yggdrasil, including a divine realm on its third layer known as the Merciful Court.\nLinnorms typically knew how to speak abyssal in addition to draconic.\nSome acted as servants of the deity Sharindlar.\nMany scholars and trophy hunters prized their skins, willing to pay up to 12,000 gold pieces for an intact find.\n* The Hermit\n* Kroth, a dread linnorm that inhabited the unnumbered layer of Demonwing in the Abyss, acting as a guardian of the balor commander Straoths tower."
