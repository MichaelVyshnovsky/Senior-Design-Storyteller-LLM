        "Description": "Linnorms had immense bodies that were [[snake]]-like, lacking both wings and rear limbs. Their bodies could grow to be as large as {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} and weigh as much as {{SI|2|tons|k}}.\n\nThese creatures had flexible skeletons, containing hundreds of vertebrae, and grew large trunk muscles that allowed them to dig into the ground with the scales of their underbelly and by pushing forward with their ribs. Their forelegs ended in sharp, razor-like claws.",
        "Personality": "These creatures were typically known to be cruel, hateful, and very spiteful. They were infamously untrustworthy, rarely honoring bargains.{{Cite dragon/356/The Ecology of the Linnorm|63}}\n\nThey were fiercely territorial.{{Cite dragon/356/The Ecology of the Linnorm|62}} Unlike some draconic creatures, not all linnorms were known to be avaricious. The oldest of linnorms typically suffered from some form of insanity due to their isolative nature.",
        "Abilities": "Much like the more common breeds of dragon, linnorms possessed varying forms of [[dragon breath]]. They also were immune to [[magic]]al effects that induced sleep or paralysis.<ref group=\"note\">In 2nd edition, the non-unique races of linnorm dragons progressed through the usual twelve [[Dragon aging|age categories]] of [[:Category:True dragons|true dragons]].\n\nLinnorms had keen visual senses, possessing both a form of [[blindsight]] and [[darkvision]].",
        "Combat": "When engaging in combat a linnorm relied upon their dragon breath and immense strength, attempting to crush their opponents and swipe them with their tails.
