A wyvern (|audio=Wyvern1.ogg ) was a large winged lizard, distantly related to the dragon, with a poisonous stinging tail and sharp teeth.
These creatures varied in length from , weighed around a ton, and were covered in dark brown or grey scales. They typically had either red or orange eyes and their jaws were filled with long and sharp teeth.
Unlike true dragons, wyverns only had a pair of hind legs instead of a set four. Their wingspan could get over  in length. And their tails were often quite long, comprising almost half of their bodies, yet very mobile. These ended in a thick cartilage knot with a stinger protruding out of it, not unlike that of a scorpion.
Telltale sounds that these creatures produced included loud hisses and throated growls, similar to the vocalizations of alligators.
Wyverns were aggressive and not greatly intelligent.Although normally depicted with only two legs, some sources, such as the ADD comic "The Gathering", show wyverns with four legs like dragons. The scorpion-like sting on the tail suggests it is in fact a wyvern.
When fighting these creatures would dive down from above, grabbing prey with their hind leg claws, and then attempt to sting them to death. They were also known to slash at creatures with their claws mid-flight. Their tails were so long that opponents were typically struck by a wyverns tail before their legs.
Wyverns can be both solitary and group animals. They did not have a strong odor, although their lairs often could be tracked by following the smell of their recent kills.
