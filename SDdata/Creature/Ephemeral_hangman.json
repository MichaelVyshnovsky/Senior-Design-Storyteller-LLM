        "mainbody": "An '''ephemeral hangman''' was an abnormal [[aberration]] of the [[Plane of Shadow]] that could pass through shadows and spaces much too small for its great size in search of unsuspecting and vulnerable prey.<ref group=\"note\">By its name and apparent composition, the hangman appears to be of the class of Shadow Plane creatures called [[ephemeral]]s, but this is not explicitly stated or confirmed.",
        "Description": "Its form was little more than a mass of dozens of writhing black tendrils or tentacles, all entwined in a trunk-like body and with a gnashing fang-filled mouth at their heart. Appearing black as [[ink]] and nigh-unseen in darkness, it seemed to be made of pure shadow, yet it weighed almost {{SI|1000|lb|k|long=yes}}. Usually standing erect to a height of {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}}, it appeared like an alien and animated tree. However, it could extend its tendrils out and lay itself flat like a shadow upon the floor. A victim's first sight of one could be seeing a patch of shadow open and uncoil, almost like a flower, into tentacles and mouth.",
        "Personality": "An ambush predator, the ephemeral lurked in small and dark places and waited to seize unsuspecting prey. It preferred living creatures and especially those too small and weak to defend themselves, even children.\n\nIt despised bright light, as it limited its shadow-borne powers. If exposed to sunlight or a ''[[daylight]]'' spell, it would try to escape by whatever means it still had.\n\nOn the rare occasions they did speak, ephemeral hangmen were known to use a certain dialect of [[Undercommon]].",
        "Abilities": "By entering a kind of \"shadow pocket\", an ephemeral hangman could pass through spaces too small to normally contain it. It could fit its bulk inside a space only {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} wide without impediment, and even as small as {{SI|2.5|ft|long=yes}} wide, but was hampered. This ability helped it hide, but it could only be done in darkness or shadow. If a bright light (more than a torch or ''[[light]]'' spell) shone on it while in its shadow pocket, the ability failed and the ephemeral hangman was forced into the closest able to contain it, dealing it damage according to the distance moved.\n\nAn ephemeral hangman could transport itself instantly to a site up to {{SI|840|ft|long=yes}} away by stepping into a shadow and travelling via the Plane of Shadow, similar to ''[[dimension door]]'' or the ''[[step into shadow]]'' mystery of a [[shadowcaster]]. They could do this thrice a day, but of course only in a place of darkness or shadow.\n\nAn ephemeral hangman quickly healed any injuries it took, and it could even reattach severed tendrils in a moment or regrow them from the stump in up to 18 minutes. Only [[:Category:Light_spells|spells of light]] and ''[[searing light]]'' harmed it permanently. However, this regeneration halted in bright light, and then the ephemeral hangman could be harmed normally.\n\nA strike from an ephemeral hangman's tendrils caused the target to be slowed, as with a ''[[slow]]'' spell, if they could not resist with an act of will. The effect lasted anywhere up to 72 seconds, though to a victim it would feel much, much longer while the hangman was constricting and eating them.\n\nA creature of shadow, the ephemeral hangman was naturally very good at hiding and moving stealthily.",
        "Combat": "When it struck with its tendrils, an ephemeral hangman could immediately attempt to grab a creature much smaller than itself (that is, around [[human]] size or smaller). If the target could not free themself, the ephemeral hangman would quickly drag them into mouth and bite them, or else try to constrict and crush themâ€”likely how it got its name.",
        "Society": "An aberration formed from pure shadow, ephemeral hangmen were abnormal even among the denizens of the Plane of Shadow.",
        "History": "The origin of the ephemeral hangmen was unknown to all. A few sages theorized that they began as the Shadow Plane counterparts of a tentacled creature like the [[roper]] and that these \"shadow selves\" somehow achieved their own independent existence and sentience.\n\nSeveral ephemeral hangmen appeared amidst the shadow tentacles in the [[Black Rift]] in the Plane of Shadow when the [[church of Shar|dark priestesses]] there performed a ritual to worship [[Shar]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, they served the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]] as guards, attacking all trespassers. They occupied a chamber wherein religious tapestries were displayed. Sometimes, they hunted in the surrounding [[Shadow Swamp]]. They were likely defeated when adventurers in service to Mystra came and ruined cult operations there in early [[Eleint]] of that year.<ref group=\"note\">It is unknown if they portal into/out of the body, use their ''step into shadow'' power, or emerge from a shadow pocket in the body."
