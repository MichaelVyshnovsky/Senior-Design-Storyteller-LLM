        "mainbody": "'''Electric eels''' were a rarely-sighted species of [[eel]] in [[Faer√ªn]] that possessed the unique ability to discharge a field of electricity. Electric eels endemic to saltwater and ocean environments were sometimes called '''marine eels'''.",
        "Description": "Electric eels had long scaleless bodies, with mouths devoid of teeth, and two short pectoral fins. They also had a single pelvic fin that stretched across most of the length of their stomach. This pelvic fin enabled the eels to quickly propel themselves in any direction, even backwards. Their bodies were largely a dull gray, though often displayed either green or red coloration on both their stomach and throat.\n\nHowever, the body length of a fresh water and marine electric differed significantly. Electric eels that inhabited freshwater environments typically grew to an average length of {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}}. The marine variety were known to grown to lengths of around {{SIrange|20|40|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Biology": "Electric eel possessed an inherent immunity any form of damage from electicity.",
        "Behavior": "Like most species of eel, an electric eel were not aggressive creatures and would only attack if disturbed or threatened.",
        "Combat": "When either hunting or needing to protect itself, an electric eel was capable of discharging a jolt of electricity out to radius of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}}. This would either stun or outright kill most nearby creatures. If done for the purpose of self-defense, an electric eel would typically try to flee from their opponent afterwards in order to recover from the discharge.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], rumors circulated claiming that [[kuo-toa]] were trying to capture and domesticate electric eels to guard their lairs.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diets": "Electric eels were a carnivorous species. They typically feasted upon small fish and [[frog]]s, swallowing them whole as they lacked teeth.",
            "Habitats": "Electric eels were known to inhabit shallow bodies of both fresh water and salt water, commonly at depths of {{SIrange|30|150|ft}}. and tropical areas of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], electric eels could be found in the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze]].",
            "Relationships": "Though very difficult to train, some aquatic [[ranger]]s were known to have them as [[animal companion]]s.",
            "Usages": "Several crushed electric eels could mixed with the blood of a [[blue dragon]] in a broth to [[item enchantment|enchant]] its [[dragon's tooth|tooth]]."
