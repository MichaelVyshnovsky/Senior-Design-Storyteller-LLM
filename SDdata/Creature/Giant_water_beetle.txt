Giant water beetles, otherwise known simply as water beetles, were a species of giant beetle.
The bodies of these beetles typically grew to be  in length. They were rapid swimmers, but on land they moved at a rather slow and ponderous pace.
Like most species of beetle, these creatures lacked good eyesight or hearing. Because of this, they primarily relied upon their tactile and taste senses. The latter was done by means of their antennae. They also hunted by sensing vibrations in the water.
Giant water beetles were air-breathing creatures, though they could remain underwater for extended periods of time. This was done by catching and trapping air bubbles beneath their large wings. They often carried these air bubbles to some underwater cave or cavity capable of holding an air supply.
Giant water beetles largely lived solitarily lives.
These beetles were a voracious species of omnivores. Like other species of beetle they were liable to eat almost any form of organic matter, though they preferred to prey upon almost any form of animal. They would often attack and sink shipping vessels in order to get at the food inside.
Giant water beetles were typically found inhabiting bodies of fresh water, no less than  deep. With these sometimes being navigable rivers or lakes.
They were known to be found in some of the moors and rivers of the North, occasionally in Anauroch in the River of Gems, and in the temperate areas of the Sea of Fallen Stars.
In the Hordelands they could be found in the lakes, rivers, and swamps of the Ama Basin during the summer season. In neighboring continent of Kara-tur they could be found in temperate, tropical, and sub-tropical bodies of water, as well as in temperate swamps. Such as the rivers of Akari island.
They could also be found in dungeons, such as in the Wyllowwood level of Undermountain.
Around the , the Flotilla of DEATH chased a lost giant water beetle away from the city of Ravens Bluff.Port of Ravens Bluff (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles OKane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR.
A giant water beetle could be summoned by the summon monster IV spell if the caster was upon a body of water or underwater.
