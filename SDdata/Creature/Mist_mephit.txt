A '''mist mephit''' was a [[mephit]] from the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Steam]] that was a distinct offshoot of the [[steam mephit]].

==Description==
Mist mephits were small [[imp]]-like creatures that preferred cool climates when on the [[Prime Material plane]], and places such as swamps, which gave off thick mist. They had translucent gray, or green, bodies that continuously emitted a thick mist that enabled them to blend into their environs.

==Personality==
These mephits were often found hiding in dark and foggy places, mainly because they were shy. Thus, they rarely interacted with others, and weren't found indulging in typical mephit banter. They believed themselves to be elite spies, and were often found spying on other mephits. In some situations, they acted as messengers, and would relay information from one mephit to another, usually regarding treachery.

==Combat==
When forced into combat, mist mephits attacked with their claws. They could also surround an area in, or create a wall of, choking mist, which they could stand in, as they were immune to [[poison]]. Mist mephits were able to spit sticky green balls of mists at their opponents, which would damage and even blind them. They had a chance to ''[[gate]]'' other mephits (other mist and [[ice mephit]]s only) in to aid them in combat.
