A '''darklight''' was an [[undead]] creature of the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance]].

Mortal [[spirit]]s that departed their bodies at death, but did not become [[petitioner]]s and then became lost on their way to its [[afterlife|final rest]], might arrive at the Plane of Radiance. Here, they were filled with [[radiant energy]] and became free-willed undead beings, called darklights.

They appeared as humanoid-shaped specters of blackness with bright, shining eyes of ever-changing colors.
