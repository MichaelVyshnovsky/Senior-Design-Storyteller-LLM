The '''titanothere''' ({{Pronounce|ty|T@N|o|theer|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}}), also known as '''brontotherium''', was a massive ancient horned mammal related to [[rhinoceri]].

==Description==
Titanotheres had an appearance similar to that of a rhinoceros. The key difference was that titanotheres were much larger and had a large, blunt horn on their snout. Some had two or even more horns and they came in various shapes and sizes. Others lacked a horn completely. Some had stony hides, very thick and strong enough to provide protection. Others were covered in horny plates or thick, shaggy fur.

==Behavior==
These massive creatures had irritable dispositions.

==Combat==
Titanotheres were dangerous prey. When threatened, a titanothere would not hesitate to charge at a predator. It was strong enough to throw a [[humanoid]] up to {{SI|20|ft}} with a blow from its horn. Titanotheres also trampled smaller targets, crushing them.

==Ecology==
Titanotheres were herbivores and lived in small herds.
===Habitats===
Titanotheres were known to live in the [[Chultan Peninsula]].
===Usages===
The hide of a titanothere was often used as [[leather armor]]. An intact titanothere hide sold for up to 70 [[gp]] and provided enough material to craft armor for large humanoids.

The [[Pterafolk]] of the Chultan Peninsula considered their flesh to be a delicacy.

A titanothere could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' [[spell]].<ref>
