The titanothere (), also known as brontotherium, was a massive ancient horned mammal related to rhinoceri.
Titanotheres had an appearance similar to that of a rhinoceros. The key difference was that titanotheres were much larger and had a large, blunt horn on their snout. Some had two or even more horns and they came in various shapes and sizes. Others lacked a horn completely. Some had stony hides, very thick and strong enough to provide protection. Others were covered in horny plates or thick, shaggy fur.
These massive creatures had irritable dispositions.
Titanotheres were dangerous prey. When threatened, a titanothere would not hesitate to charge at a predator. It was strong enough to throw a humanoid up to  with a blow from its horn. Titanotheres also trampled smaller targets, crushing them.
Titanotheres were herbivores and lived in small herds.
Titanotheres were known to live in the Chultan Peninsula.
The hide of a titanothere was often used as leather armor. An intact titanothere hide sold for up to 70 gp and provided enough material to craft armor for large humanoids.
The Pterafolk of the Chultan Peninsula considered their flesh to be a delicacy.
A titanothere could be summoned by the conjure animals spell.
