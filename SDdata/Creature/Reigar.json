        "mainbody": "'''Reigar''' were a rare and powerful species of spacefaring [[celestial]]s. They wandered across [[wildspace]] and the [[Astral Sea]] in search of anything that would inspire their creativity.",
        "Description": "Reigar were tall [[humanoid]]s, standing anywhere from {{SIrange|6|7|ft|long=yes}}, with reddish-blonde hair and a willowy build. They were typically androgynous compared to [[human]]s;\n\nReigar valued self-expression and artistry, so a wide variety of jewelry, tattoos, make-up, hair styles, and many other forms of self-decoration were known to be used by the reigar. There was no distinction between sexes or social status involved in this, but rather was merely an expression of their creativity. They considered the art of war to be the highest level of creative expression.",
        "Personality": "Reigar valued art and artistry above all else, and spent all of their time in pursuit of their artistic ideals. However, their dedication to art precluded any care for morality or even kindnessâ€” reigar were known to favor spells that killed slowly, such as ''[[cloudkill]]'', over spells that killed quickly, like ''[[fireball]]'', in order to enjoy watching their victims writhe, gasp, and beg. Such mottoes as \"Art for art's sake\", \"The ends justify the means\", and \"Anything for art, nothing without style, and everyone for himself\", had all been applied to them.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:ReigarCosette.png|100px|left|The reigar [[Cosette]].]]\nReigar were highly intelligent, creative, and inventive. They were also powerful spellcasters and adept crafters of magical objects. When spellcasting, they were known to use magic from all of the schools, although they often disdained illusions as they disliked making false images.\n\nTheir glory made them harder to hit with attacks and also made them highly resistant to spells. It was said that a glory would be darker when a reigar was displeased, and lighter when they were pleased.",
        "Combat": "Reigar only entered into combat if their servitor [[helot]]s and [[lakshu]] were defeated, and then relied on their ''[[shakti]]''. However, their combined intellect, spellcasting, and ''shakti'' made them exceedingly dangerous.",
        "Possessions": "Each reigar carried with them a ''[[taralith]]'', to which only they could [[attunement|attune]]. This article of jewelry allowed them to conjure forth a [[golem]] that appeared exactly like themself.",
        "Society": {
            "Relations": "Reigar were incredibly rare and disinterested in the larger goings-on of the multiverse. However, they were known to not get along with the [[neogi]], who referred to them as \"damn liars\", and the [[clockwork horror]]s, which the reigar thought of as \"bad art\". Conversely, the [[aperusa]] people adored the reigar, although the reigar themselves did not particularly care about them.<ref> The reigar were also known to dislike the [[dohwar]], saying that the creatures \"dress to make one ill\".<ref>"
        },
        "History": "At some point in the distant past, the [[lakshu]] and the reigar became allies, with the reigar appropriating the lakshu as a work of art, which entailed the reigar making the lakshu species have a uniform appearance.<ref>\n\nSometime after that, about a millennia ago, reigar travelling off-world using their [[Esthetic|esthetics]] destroyed their homeworld using weapons of unimaginable power, having no concern for those on the ground, all in pursuit of the ultimate artistic expression of warfare and a plot to create the most beautiful display of carnage the [[Cosmology|multiverse]] had ever seen and will ever see. This cataclysmic event came be known among the reigar as the 'Master Stroke'.\n\nSince the destruction of their homeworld, the few remaining Reigar wander across the Astral Sea in search of insight for their artistry.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The reigar were sometimes credited with creating or at least teaching other species about art and beauty; such stories (which named species such as the [[elves]], [[dwarves]], and [[tinker gnome]]s) also said that the species they taught forgot most of it.\n\nThe reigar were also said to have invented [[spelljamming helm]]s, and that they were the suppliers for the [[arcane (race)|arcane]]. While they may have invented spelljamming helms, the latter part of that rumor was unlikely as the reigar disdained manufacturing anything, like most repetitive processes.\n\nIt was also said that the arcane would bow to reigar and do what the reigar told them. The same was also said of [[mind flayer]]s, although it was hotly denied by that species. The reigar also claimed to have created the [[zodar]] on a whim, but this was questionable at best.<ref>",
        "Notable Reigar": "*Lord [[Hastain]], a powerful reigar that was a noble on the [[Rock of Bral]].<ref>"
