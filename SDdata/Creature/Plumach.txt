'''Plumachs''' were the least powerful of all the [[rilmani]] subspecies.

{{Quote|The [[portal|gate]]-burgs are a slap in our face. Any basher can see that they don’t belong on the [[Outlands]]. Haw many towns’ve fallen onto [[Baator]] from where [[Ribcage]] stands now? I say, let ’em go. We don’t need their kind of views polluting the [[Spire]]. In fact, I don’t see as we need any [[power]]s parking their [[divine realm|realms]] in the Land, either. We’d make out just fine without their addle-caved [[petitioner]]s prancing about.|Aulunmar, a plumach orator}}

==Description==
Plumachs were short [[humanoid]]s with stocky builds and dull, gray metallic skin. Their shoulders were broad, their legs heavy, and their hands were wide and stubby. Like all rilmani, their eyes emitted a pearly light.

==Personality==
Plumachs were staunch isolationists above all else, going to great lengths to mind their own business. When engaged in combat they could be very stubborn and tenacious. They typically had a great deal of common sense and practical wisdom.

Plumachs highly valued hard work and showed respect where it was due.

==Abilities==
Though they were the weakest of rilmani, they possessed a decent natural strength and had dense hides that could only be harmed by weapons with a [[item enchantment|''+1 or greater enchantment'']]. In addition, they possessed a few innate [[spell]]-like abilities, which they could use one at a time. These included ''[[chill touch]]'', ''[[detect alignment]]'', ''[[heat metal]]'', and ''[[hold person]]''. Once per day they could create a ''[[fog cloud]]''.

In addition, plumachs could cast the standard rilmani arsenal of spells: ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[dismissal]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''. They always had the spell ''[[know alignment]]'' active.

Like all rilmani, they could freely travel to the [[Astral plane]] or any of the [[Outer Planes]], but their access to the [[Prime Material plane]] was restricted. They were only capable of traveling there if a creature of law or chaos of equal power was already present.

==Combat==
Lacking the grace and strength of their more powerful rilmani-kin, plumachs would only resort to combat whenever it was clear that their lives or interests were threatened. They typically fought with [[club]]s, [[heavy mace]]s, and [[maul]]s made of lead.

==Society==
In rilmani society, plumachs made up the common citizenry of the [[Outlands]]. They carried out day-to-day business in such roles as craftsmen, merchants, and teamsters.

Plumachs devoted a great deal of their time to creating either works of art or devices of comfort and convenience. Beyond their role as common citizenry, plumachs were involved in keeping an eye on the balance of things in the [[Outlands]], which made plumach emissaries and traders common throughout that [[plane]]. In times of great need they were rallied by [[aurumach]]s to defend [[the Balance]].

===Relationships===
Some plumachs were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deities]] [[Vergadain]]<ref> and [[Waukeen]].<ref>
