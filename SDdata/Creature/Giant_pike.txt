'''Giant pikes''' were a monstrous variety of the mundane [[fish]] known as [[pike (fish)|pikes]].

==Description==
Giant pikes had long, flexible bodies with greenish-yellow scales that helped them blend into parts of their environment. Their bodies could grow up to {{SIrange|9|14|ft|long=yes}} in length. They were also very rapid swimmers.

==Behavior==
Giant pikes were very aggressive. When hungry, they were liable to attack almost any nearby creature.

==Biology==
These fish possessed very keen eyesight.

==Combat==
Though giant pikes sometimes stalked their prey, they typically hunted by waiting in some seaweed for potential prey to swim by. Due to their greenish-yellow scales their bodies were camouflaged within the underwater plant life. Due to this and their rapid speed of movement, giant pikes often surprised their victims.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Giant pikes were a carnivorous, predatory species.

===Habitats===
These creatures were typically found inside large, deep lakes of fresh water in temperate regions.

In [[Faerûn]], they inhabited some of the bodies of water across [[Cormanthor]], particularly the [[River Ashaba]]. Deep within the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], they were a relatively common variety of giant fish around [[Serôs]].

On the [[Moonshae Isles]] they could be found in various bodies of freshwater. In the [[Unapproachable East]], giant pikes could be found in the lakes of [[Rashemen]].<ref>

In the [[Underdark]] of the [[Bloodstone Lands]], they could be found in the upper lake of [[Deepearth]].

Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in the tropical and subtropical fresh waters of [[Kara-Tur]]. During the summer season they could be found in the lakes, rivers, and swamps of the [[Ama Basin]]. Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], they inhabited the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]'s [[plane]] of [[Qui]]. They could also be found in some parts of the [[River Styx]].

===Relationships===
[[Nixie]]s were often known to domesticate giant pikes.

Some placed giant pikes within their moats to act as guard animals.
