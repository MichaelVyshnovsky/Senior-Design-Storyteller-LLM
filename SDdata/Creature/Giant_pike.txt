Giant pikes were very aggressive. When hungry, they were liable to attack almost any nearby creature.
These fish possessed very keen eyesight.
Though giant pikes sometimes stalked their prey, they typically hunted by waiting in some seaweed for potential prey to swim by. Due to their greenish-yellow scales their bodies were camouflaged within the underwater plant life. Due to this and their rapid speed of movement, giant pikes often surprised their victims.

These creatures were typically found inside large, deep lakes of fresh water in temperate regions.

In the Underdark of the Bloodstone Lands, they could be found in the upper lake of Deepearth.
Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in the tropical and subtropical fresh waters of Kara-Tur. During the summer season they could be found in the lakes, rivers, and swamps of the Ama Basin. Beyond the Prime Material plane, they inhabited the Celestial Bureaucracys plane of Qui. They could also be found in some parts of the River Styx.
Nixies were often known to domesticate giant pikes.
