'''Tren''' were a species of reptilian humanoids that dwelled in damp cave systems. They were considered to be scalykind by other Scaled Ones.<ref>

==Description==
Tren were humanoid in form, with scaly skin and lizard-like heads with wide mouths full of sharp teeth. Their scales were typically grey, brown, or green in color; the scales of females tended to be smoother than those of males. Tren had tails that were reported to either be vestigial or long and slender. They were bulkier and more muscular in form than either [[troglodyte]]s or [[lizardfolk]]. Tren stood upright, approximately as tall as a human, and weighed on average about {{SI|220|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Tren despised warm-blooded creatures and had a special animosity for [[human]]s and [[dwarves]]. They were not particularly intelligent and had few, if any, moral standards or rules.

==Abilities==
When angered or frightened, tren naturally secreted an oily chemical that produced a stench that nearly every form of living animal found to be extremely offensive. This stench could sicken anyone within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the tren, and even weaken those within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.

Additionally, trens' scales changed color to match their surroundings, which helped them hide while standing in front of a stable background.

<!--==Combat==-->

==Society==
===Languages===
Tren commonly spoke [[Draconic language|Draconic]], the [[Lizardfolk language|Lizardfolk tongue]], and the [[Troglodyte language|Troglodyte tongue]]. They also occasionally spoke their own creole language, derived from the latter two, and [[Common]].

==History==
Tren were originally bred by the [[yuan-ti]] as hybrids of troglodytes and lizardfolk.

After the fall of Serpentes, many tren were traded to other powerful creatures in exchange for magic and favors, but their horrific stench meant that they were often released.
