        "mainbody": "Half-goblins were humanoids born from a pairing of goblins with another race, such as humans. They could be found wherever such a pairing took place, notably in Icewind Dale and the Dustwall Mountains.\nHalf-goblins with human blood were taller than regular goblins. Their eyes had colors on the human spectrum, such as blue, rather than the standard goblin red.\n* Zeth, a blind half-human who lived isolated from the rest of his goblin tribe in the Dustwallows. Granted magical sight by his tribes shaman, Zeth led a war party on a quest to redeem both himself and his tribe for being human-like."
