        "mainbody": "esert wraiths were a rare form of malevolent, undead spirits that arose from the bodies of those killed by a skriaxit.\nThese spirits had two forms. That of their previous self, typically a human, and that of a jackal. They were capable of shifting between these two forms as they saw fit.\nDesert wraiths were wholly evil creatures, whose only motivation in un-life was to destroy any living creature they came across. Their intelligence was rather low, but they were capable of cunning.\nThese spirits could see in total darkness as if they were in noon and much like the average wraith their touch drained life energy from living creatures. Unless washed in holy water, those killed by them would rise within forty-eight hours as a zombie.\nDesert wraiths could be turned, similarly to spectres. They could be harmed by weapons with a +1 or greater enchantment. If exposed to sunlight they would perish.\nDesert wraiths would either hide themselves within the sand and surprise their prey or charge at them in their jackal form and then attack in their human form once close enough.\nDesert wraiths fed off the life energy of living creatures.\nDesert wraiths were found wherever skriaxits could be found, which were typically subtropical deserts, such as the Great Vale in Mulhorand. They only roamed the desert at night, retreating to barrows they dug within the sand to hide from the sun."
