        "mainbody": "'''Desert wraiths''' were a rare form of malevolent, [[undead]] spirits that arose from the bodies of those killed by a [[skriaxit]].",
        "Description": "These spirits had two forms. That of their previous self, typically a [[human]], and that of a [[jackal]]. They were capable of shifting between these two forms as they saw fit.",
        "Behavior": "Desert wraiths were wholly evil creatures, whose only motivation in un-life was to destroy any living creature they came across. Their intelligence was rather low, but they were capable of cunning.",
        "Abilities": "These spirits could see in total darkness as if they were in noon and much like the average [[wraith]] their touch drained life energy from living creatures. Unless washed in [[holy water]], those killed by them would rise within forty-eight hours as a [[zombie]].\n\nDesert wraiths could be [[turn undead|turned]], similarly to [[spectre]]s. They could be harmed by weapons with a ''[[item enchantment|+1 or greater enchantment]]''. If exposed to sunlight they would perish.",
        "Combat": "Desert wraiths would either hide themselves within the [[sand]] and surprise their prey or charge at them in their jackal form and then attack in their human form once close enough.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Desert wraiths fed off the life energy of living creatures.",
            "Habitats": "Desert wraiths were found wherever skriaxits could be found, which were typically subtropical deserts, such as the [[Great Vale]] in [[Mulhorand]]. They only roamed the desert at night, retreating to barrows they dug within the sand to hide from [[the sun]]."
