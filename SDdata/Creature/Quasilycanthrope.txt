'''Quasilycanthropes''' were individuals who resisted [[lycanthropy]] after being infected, due to the latent power of their bloodline, and developed limited shapeshifting abilities instead.{{Cite web/Earthmother's Weapons}}

==Description==
Some [[human]]s or [[giant]]s who had [[lycanthrope]] ancestors were indistinguishable from regular members of their race, until exposed to lycanthropy. If the creature infecting them was of the same kind as their ancestors, they resisted the lycanthropy and their latent traits emerged instead. For example, a quasiwerewolf would require a bite by a [[werewolf]] for its latent abilities to awaken.{{Cite web/Earthmother's Weapons}}

Quasilycanthropes whose abilities awakened were tougher than before, and gained limited shapeshifting abilities closely linked to their associated animal. For example, a quasiwerewolf could grow shaggy hair and sharp canine teeth or change their eye color to those of a wolf, whereas a quasiweretiger could grow whiskers and a tail.
