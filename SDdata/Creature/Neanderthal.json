        "mainbody": "'''Neanderthals''', otherwise known as '''cavefolk''', were an ancient [[humanoid]] race distantly related to [[human]]s. They were descended from the same archaic humans who lived during the [[Days of Thunder]].<ref>",
        "Description": "Neanderthals largely looked like humans, albeit with a number of distinctions. They were tall and thickly built, had long arms, and were incredibly hairy. Their heads were generally a bit larger than those of humans, with a sloping brow and protruding jaw.\n\nThey were often known to adorn their bodies in war paint or a crude form of tattoos. Crudely tanned [[Hide armor|hides]] were the most common form of armor for them.",
        "Personality": "Unlike many intelligent races, neanderthals had no interest in the alignment concepts of [[good]], [[evil]], [[law]], and [[chaos]]. They also rarely felt an ambitious drive to expand their territory, though would defend their homes quite fiercely.\n\nDespite their primitive way of life, neanderthals were largely just as intelligent and cunning as humans.",
        "Biology": "Neanderthals were known to possess a slightly greater degree of strength and keener sense of smell than humans, though their eyesight was considered to be poorer than average.{{Cite dragon/44/Fantasy Genetics: Humanoid Races in Review|16}}\n\nNeanderthals were also known to have a great tolerance for extreme climates, suffering little in environments where temperatures ranged between {{SIrange|-20|140|°F|long = yes}}. Despite all these distinctions, neanderthals were still largely human and could be affected by the same things as them. The offspring of a human and neanderthal coupling could easily pass for either parent's race.",
        "Combat": "The fighting style of neanderthals was generally comparable to that of a [[barbarian]], though many were also known to be capable [[druid]]s.\n\nNeanderthals fought with weapons that were made of stone or otherwise considered primitive. Out of all of these, spears were the most commonly used.",
        "History": "Around [[1340 DR]], a tribe of fifty neanderthals inhabited the lower hills north of [[Phlan]].\n\nAt some point prior to the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], a group of neanderthals living in the isolated reaches of the [[Thunder Peaks]] acted as lackeys for the [[rune magic]] disciples of [[Valmous]].<ref> Among those disciples, the healer known as [[Erigol]] was an ardent advocate for their rights.<ref>\n\nAs part of maintaining the illusory [[Stranded Tern]], the [[green dragon]] [[Tarith]] disguised a number of neanderthals and other creatures roaming the Thunder Peaks as the establishment's guests and staff using the powers of the ''[[Dragon's Pearl]]''.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Following the rise of human civilization, neanderthals were displaced from the lands they traditionally inhabited. Some were known to lair within ancient ruins or the crevasses of rock formations when such caves were not available.\n\nThe area surrounding a neanderthal clan's lair was considered their hunting grounds. These were usually no larger than a half-day's travel, since neanderthals preferred to return to their dwellings by nightfall. These hunting grounds were often marked with crude fetishes made of skin, bone, and trophies taken from their defeated enemies.",
            "Diet": "Neanderthals were typically known to hunt [[bison]], [[caribou]], [[deer]], [[horse]]s, [[ground sloth]]s,{{Cite dragon/137/Into the Age of Mammals|49}} glyptodons, [[woolly mammoth]]s, and [[branta]].",
            "Religion": "Religious belief varied widely among neanderthals throughout their history, with faith being taught by their druids or [[sorcerer]]s through oral tradition and cave paintings. Religion was considered a significant part of their society, as it provided a framework for explaining everything they couldn't understand about the world.\n\nWorship of specific deities was rare, though a few clans were known to worship the [[giant]] gods [[Thrym]] and [[Ulutiu]]. They would build elaborate fetishes or crude altars at which to worship them or perform sacrifices. More common for them was reverence of [[fire]] and clans often had a central bonfire chamber that they sought to keep burning eternally.\n\nOther clans practiced a form of ancestor worship and would mark graves with a complex series of cairns. The clans who practiced this form of faith believed that their ancestors watched over them throughout their lives, protected them, and then judged them once they died.",
            "Languages": "Neanderthals spoke a crude form of modern [[Common]] and had no written language. Instead they used cave paintings and a rich oral tradition to maintain important concepts and stories.",
            "Relationships": "Neanderthals traditionally had poor relationships with other races. Most notably with [[frost folk]], [[orc]]s,{{Cite dragon/118/Out of the Stone Age|62}}"
