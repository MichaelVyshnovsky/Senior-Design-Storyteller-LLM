Tien lung, also known as celestial dragons, were dragons that were found in the mountains of Kara-Tur.
Tien lungs were physically distinguished by their long, serpentine body and enormous size, up to 155 feet (47 meters) in length. They were born with dull gold scales but as they grew older the scales changed to a bright radiant yellow. Their scales gave off a sweet aroma, similar to cherry blossoms. Some tien lung had light green or orange scales. They had polychromatic beards, manes and whiskers. Their whiskers were long and rose over their heads like horns.
Tien lungs tended to be smug and arrogant. Despite this they were noble and honorable. Pan lung resented and were fiercely jealous of tien lung and would sometimes attack one unprovoked in a jealous rage. 
When threatened, a tien lung attempted to scare attackers with their breath weapon, a cone of fire 90 feet (27 meters) long and 30 feet (9 meters) wide at its base. If pressured into a fight, they engaged in melee combat with their claws, fangs and tail. A tien lungs preferred tactic was to attack from the air, using its breath weapon against its opponents. They would also dive and attack from above using their claws and tail. 
A tien lung had innate magical abilities, each gained as they grew older. They could use control weather several times a day, the frequency of which increased as they aged. Three times per day a mature tien lung could use pyrotechnics and suggestion. Once per day a mature tien lung could use fire storm, meteor swarm, and sunburst.
A tien lung lacked wings, but was able to fly due to a magical yellow pearl embedded in their brains, this pearl was similar to that on a shen lung. If found on a dead tien lung or removed from a live one, this pearl was worth 1,000gp yet did not retain its magical abilities. At birth they could immediately breathe both water and air. Tien lung made their home in palaces found in clouds and on the peaks of mountains. A tien lungs diet consisted of opal and pearl. Tien lungs lived a solitary life, mates never lived with each other and a mother tien lung would banish her offspring as soon as they were old enough to fend for themselves. Older tien lung usually had several air elemental who acted as their servants or bodyguards. These elementals were fiercely loyal to the dragon and obeyed their commands unconditionally.
Within the Celestial Bureaucracy, tien lung were in charge of controlling the weather except rain. They had a reputation of being the most favorite of all the officials in the Celestial Bureaucracy, a reputation they did little to discourage.
