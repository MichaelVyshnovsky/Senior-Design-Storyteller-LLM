        "mainbody": "'''Firetails''' were creatures of living flame.",
        "Description": "There were two types of firetails, lesser firetails and greater firetails, which were also called '''tshala'''. They both were identical in appearance, expect greater firetails were longer. Firetails looked like a [[fey]]-type creature made of dancing, living flames.",
        "Abilities": "Greater firetails had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[feeblemind]]'', ''[[fire trap]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[maze]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'' and ''[[remove curse]]'' spells once per day, and ''[[fireball]]'' several times a day. Greater firetails were capable of ''plane shifting'' themselves and a small group of lesser firetails. Both types of firetails were immune to all fire and heat-based effects and spells, and were vulnerable to cold and water-based effects and spells.",
        "Combat": "Firetails were formidable opponents in battle. Their flame is hot enough to cause severe burns and could ignite most flammable materials such as clothing. A firetail could temporarily cause a dramatic increase in their temperature, becoming a blazing hot flame. It could only do this a few times a day, and left then drained.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Firetails originated from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. Through ''plane shifting'', firetails could be encountered across the [[Prime Material plane]], including [[Toril]].",
            "Languages": "Firetails had a unique form of communication. The firetail language was based on the shifting hues and patterns of their flames.",
            "Relationships": "Firetails loathed [[salamander]]s and attacked them on sight. They had a neutral relationship with [[fire elemental]]s, both parties simply ignoring the other. Generally, firetails were solitary creatures and choose the company of other firetails over that of other creatures. However, firetails have been known to become companions with other creatures, such as [[elves]], [[human]]s, [[pegasi]] and [[sylph]]s.\n\nAmong the members of the [[Elven pantheon]], they acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the deities [[Aerdrie Faenya]], [[Corellon]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Sehanine Moonbow]] and [[Solonor Thelandira]]."
        },
        "Notable Firetails": "* [[Flamedancer]], a tshala that dwelt in the [[Yuirwood]] until its home was destroyed, at which point it sought revenge against the [[church of Kossuth]]."
