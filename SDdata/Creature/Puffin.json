        "mainbody": "'''Puffins''' were a species of [[bird|seabirds]] found in [[Alpuk]], and, before the region was overtaken by the [[High Ice]], in the [[Rengarth Tundra]].",
        "Description": "The feathers of a puffin were predominantly black, except for a white mask, and their fat beaks were yellow. They were described as knee-high.",
        "Behavior": "Puffins communicated with jabbering vocalizations, and spent much of their time gossiping and arguing with each other, fighting amongst themselves, and procreating. They were also known to tumble and slide down mud slopes on their bellies.",
        "Ecology": "Puffin nesting grounds were known as rookeries.\n\nThe [[Iulutiun]]s considered puffins to be among their favorite foods, and ate them raw, whilst the [[aevendrow]] community of [[Callidae]] raised puffins for their [[egg]]s, much like [[chicken]]s."
