Alhoons were magic-using outcasts from mind flayer societies who had defied the ruling elder brains to achieve a limited form of lichdom. Only the most powerful mind flayer mages could achieve true lichdom and were known as illithiliches
Alhoons looked as they had in life except that their skin possessed none of the wet, smooth, slimy texture of living illithids, instead, appearing dry, wrinkled, and cracked as a result of the powerful magic resistance that had prevented a perfect conversion to lichdom. They had to work hard to keep their skin hydrated&mdashsuch as by taking frequent baths or by consuming liquids&mdashor else it would begin to desiccate.
They detested&mdashbut were not generally harmed by&mdashbright lights, extreme temperatures, and lack of food.
Many Alhoons had been wizards or sorcerers in life, and thus combined these abilities with their innate skill at psionics and the formidable resilience of a lich to become truly dangerous beings. In close quarters, they used their tentacles to target the heads&mdashand brains&mdashof their foes. As undead creatures, they were highly resilient, and further were quite resistant to most anti-undead magics, such as turning. However, most did not enjoy the full range of powers possessed by a true lich.
Alhoons favored the use of wands in combat, and often carried at least one magic item.
