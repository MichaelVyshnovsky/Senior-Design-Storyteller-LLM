Ferrumachs lived to fight. Their great strength and skill with a weapon made them formidable warriors. They were known for always wearing their heavy plate armor, which was usually covered in long, sharp spikes. Their weapons of choice tended to be axes, halberds, and flails.
In rilmani society, ferrumachs were the soldiers, sent into battle when violence was necessary to maintain balance. They followed the orders of argenachs and aurumach without hesitation. Ferrumachs lived apart and rarely socialized with other rilmani, but considered cuprilachs as fellow martial professionals. Ferrumachs lived in fortresses around the Spire, in constant vigilance.
Ferrumachs sometimes acted as servants of the goddess Waukeen. When it came to mounts, ferrumachs often rode upon the magical beasts known as kulduraths.
As of the midâ€“14 century DR, a single aurumach and several ferrumach composed one of the three groups connected to the final seal in the fifth level of Watchers Keep. Unlike other instances, these rilmani could be summoned to Toril when the spirit key was used to unlock one third of the keeps seal.
