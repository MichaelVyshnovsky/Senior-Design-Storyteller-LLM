'''Ferrumachs''' were the most numerous of all the [[rilmani]].

==Description==
Ferrumachs were tall [[humanoid]]s with broad shoulders, wide chests and large muscular arms.

==Abilities==
Ferrumachs had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[blur]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[featherfall]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[obscuring mist]]'', ''[[phantom steed]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[sanctuary]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[silence]]'', ''[[silence, 15' radius]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[tongues]]'' and ''[[wall of fog]]'' [[spell]]s.

==Combat==
Ferrumachs lived to fight. Their great strength and skill with a weapon made them formidable warriors. They were known for always wearing their heavy [[plate mail|plate]] armor, which was usually covered in long, sharp spikes. Their weapons of choice tended to be [[axe]]s, [[halberd]]s, and [[flail]]s.

==Society==
In rilmani society, ferrumachs were the soldiers, sent into battle when violence was necessary to maintain balance. They followed the orders of [[argenach]]s and [[aurumach]] without hesitation. Ferrumachs lived apart and rarely socialized with other rilmani, but considered [[cuprilach]]s as fellow martial professionals. Ferrumachs lived in fortresses around the Spire, in constant vigilance.
===Relationships===
Ferrumachs sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the goddess [[Waukeen]].<ref> When it came to [[mount]]s, ferrumachs often rode upon the [[magical beast]]s known as [[kuldurath]]s.<ref>

==History==
As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a single aurumach and several ferrumach composed one of the three groups connected to the final seal in the fifth level of [[Watcher's Keep]]. Unlike other instances, these rilmani could be summoned to [[Toril]] when the ''spirit key'' was used to unlock one third of the keep's seal.
