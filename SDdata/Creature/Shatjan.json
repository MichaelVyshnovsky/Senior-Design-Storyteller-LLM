        "mainbody": "Shatjan served as protectors of the frozen northern reaches of the Hordelands. They guarded the herds of reindeer found in the northern climates.\nThese creatures possessed the body of a man or woman, but the head of a reindeer. Their torsos were well muscled and males had large antlers crowning their head. Females had a much smaller set of antlers. Thick fur covered their head, neck, shoulders and forearms. Shatjan made their clothing from animals skins and tree bark. Most of these creatures preferred to decorate their clothing and bodies with strange symbols.\nThough fearsome to behold, these creatures did not lust after combat. When forced into combat, they were incredibly comfortable fighting in the snow and ice, which was often an advantage over their attackers. Shatjan used bone-tipped weapons including harpoons, clubs, and bows.\nShatjan were capable of attacking with a special breath weapon, unleashing a blast of freezing air that traveled up to 5 ft. \nThey were also able to instantly lower the air temperature around them within a 10 ft. radius. The temperature would drop by 10 degrees every minute. The shatjan remained unaffected by the temperature, but creatures nearby suffered accordingly. \nAll shatjan were immune to the cold and all cold-based attacks. Magical weapons were needed to strike them. \nThese solitary creatures followed the reindeer as they migrated across the vast expanse of the northern Hordelands. They would live in small communities in temporary camps during the warm summer months.\nShatjan couples mated for life. \nThey could speak with reindeer as well as speak their own tongue and the language of humans who lived within their territory. \nThe diet of a shatjan mirrored that of a normal reindeer. They would trade with humans for rare vegetables when they were able.\nMany tribes of humans in the northern Hordelands considered shatjan to be totem spirits, spurring offerings to shatjan before every major hunt. Natives of the Hordelands always treated shatjan with respect and it was considered good luck to meet one."
