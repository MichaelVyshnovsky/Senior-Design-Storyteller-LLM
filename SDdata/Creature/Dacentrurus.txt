Dacentrurus () was a species of dinosaur.
Dacentrurus looked like its cousin stegosaurus. Instead of large bony plates running along its back, dacentrurus had long, sharp spikes. Its tail ended in a cluster of spikes.
Dacentrurus were known for being aggressive.
When attacked, dacentrurus always positioned its body so their spikes were facing their opponent. It was capable of delivering significant damage with its spiked tail.
Dacentrurus were herbivores and lived in herds.
