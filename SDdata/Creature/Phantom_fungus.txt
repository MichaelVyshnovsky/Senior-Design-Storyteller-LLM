'''Phantom fungi''' were a breed of predatory, mobile [[fungus]] feared by those underground for their natural [[invisibility]].

{{quote
|Phantom fungus â€” you get them in old tunnels and caves. It's a little one though. Full grown, it would have been chewing off [[Zuzzara]]'s hip, not biting her ankles.

==Description==
Ordinarily, the only details indicating the presence of phantom fungi were the sounds of soft squelching footfalls accompanied by a strange smell of mold. If rendered visible, phantom fungi appeared as a brown or greenish brown fungal mass supported by four stumpy legs. A cluster of nodules rested atop its main body and its gaping maw was lined with rows of teeth.

Phantom fungi were constantly and permanently under the effects of ''[[greater invisibility]]'', allowing them to attack while invisible. ''[[Invisibility purge]]'' [[spell]]s could not dispel this status, but they did become visible a minute after being slain. Phantom fungi were also adept at moving quietly.

==Combat==
Phantom fungi might wait for a meal to come to them but usually quietly hunted for prey, roaming the world until they came upon suitable targets. While not especially intelligent, they had certain instinctive strategies and were capable of determining easy from difficult prey. They would attack lone individuals almost anywhere, but preferred open spaces when tackling groups, moving around slightly between each bite from its many teeth to make itself harder to find.{{Cite dungeon/84/Dungeon of the Fire Opal|110}}{{Cite dungeon/134/Home Under the Range|24}}

==Ecology==
Phantom fungi were solitary subterranean creatures.

The [[plane of shadow]] was known to host [[shadow]] phantom fungi. [[Fiendish creature|Fiendish]] and [[half-fiend]] phantom fungi were also abundant in [[Shedaklah]], the realm of the [[demon lord|Demon Queen]] of Fungi [[Zuggtmoy]]. Phantom fungi, being fungal monsters, were among the favorite and most commonly summoned minions of Zuggtmoy, and among her faithful fungoid servants who reveled in the unnaturally warm dampness and actively sought to destroy [[ooze]]s that emerged from [[Juiblex]]'s portion of the realm.{{Cite dragon/337/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Zuggtmoy: Queen of Fungi|40, 46, 54}}

==Biology==
Phantom fungi had [[low-light vision]], their sensory organs being the nodule cluster atop their main body.
