        "mainbody": "ragon tortoises were terrestrial creatures that, like their aquatic cousins the dragon turtles, were related to dragons.\nThey had massive shells, within which could form very small crevices that made suitable homes for tiny creatures.\nThese creatures were capable of breathing out a destructive blast of sand that spewed outward in a  cone, slashing away at the flesh of its foes.\nDragon tortoises were observed to live for other thousands of years.\n* Ogruhl, a tortoise of ancient Netheril that was abandoned and later adopted by a band of desert chwingas."
