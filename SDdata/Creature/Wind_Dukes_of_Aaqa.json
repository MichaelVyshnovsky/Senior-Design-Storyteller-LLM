        "Description": "Vaati were androgynous [[humanoid]]s with ebony skin and white eyes. They had muscular builds, yet smooth ebony skin, and on average grew to be {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall. Their hair was velvety and black, but they would usually shave it closely.\n\nVaati seldom wore clothing, with the exception of [[belt]]s and harnesses to carry equipment or weaponry.",
        "Personality": "[[File:Vaati 2e.png|thumb|''Vaati with ebony skin and a massive sword.'']]\nVaati were peaceful, usually preferring negotiation over fighting. As creatures of Law they would often appear narrow-minded to other races, and were overly concerned with rules and etiquette.",
        "Abilities": "Vaati were immune to all forms of aging, resistant to [[spell]]s or abilities based on [[elemental air]], and were capable of flight. Their eyes had [[infravision]], being able to see as far away as {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. Uniquely, their eyes could see through all forms of air impediments to vision, such as fog and dust.\n\nAll of them possessed an innate spellcasting ability, allowing them to cast powers similar to the spells: ''[[control temperature, 10' radius]]'', ''[[dust devil]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', and ''[[gust of wind]]''.",
        "Combat": "If they ever had to resort to combat, the vaati would typically seek to gain height advantage against their opponents and then bombard them from above with spells and ranged weaponry.",
        "History": {
            "Before the war": "Prior to the [[Dawn War]], the Wind Dukes became some of the earliest practitioners of [[elemental magic]]. Beginning as elementalists of air and lightning, they eventually mastered other elements and as their mastery of the elements grew, dozens of lawful races and elementals swore fealty to them, such as [[djinn]], [[inevitable]]s, and [[salamander]]s. At its peak their empire comprised most of the [[elemental plane]]s, uniting them under one rule,{{Cite dungeon/129/A Gathering of Winds|40}} as well as several worlds on the [[Prime Material plane]].\n\nMost of their empire was destroyed during the Dawn War.",
            "The Rod of Seven Parts": "[[File:MiskaFighting.png|thumb|200px|right|''A pair of Wind Dukes face off against Miska.'']]\nDuring the Dawn War, seven Wind Dukes were responsible for creating the [[Rod of Law]] with the help of the Soulforge of [[Moradin]] in [[Torzak-Belgirn]].",
            "Post-Dawn War": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Mwaxanar√©]], oldest living descendant of the last queen of [[Omu]], forged a [[warlock]] pact with the Wind Dukes to gain [[magic]]al powers."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "The vaati were an omnivorous race. They ate very little, subsisting primarily off of air itself, but produced a wide variety of food in their society.",
            "Languages": "The vaati spoke their own unique language. This was very rhythmic and melodic, featuring many complex whistling sounds. A group of vaati talk with each other could sound to other creatures like mere chanting or whispering. Adventuring vaati also knew how to speak [[Common]].",
            "Relationships": "Some [[aarakocra]]s felt a strong connection to the Vaati and sought to retrieve the shattered pieces of the Rod of Law. Some were said to report directly to the Dukes, and searched for the temples dedicated to evil [[archomental]]s."
