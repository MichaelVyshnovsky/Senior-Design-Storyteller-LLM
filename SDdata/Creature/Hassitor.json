They commanded powerful [[necromantic]] [[magic]] and skills in stonemasonry, which they combined together to forge the most lasting of their creations, the ''[[hassitorium]]''. Beyond these mobile fortresses, the only remnants of their civilization were monuments of bizarre architecture.",
        "History": "It wasn't quite clear when exactly the hassitor fell to extinction, but it roughly occurred when the [[baatezu]] were still a relatively young race within the [[multiverse]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|10-11}}\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] visited the plane of Acheron. There they came upon the ''hassitorium'' ''[[Ishtavarek]]'' and its captain, [[Estrak Longtooth]]. When they inquired with the [[half-orc]] as to where they were, he told them the name of his ''hassitorium'' and of the race that had created these mobile fortresses."
