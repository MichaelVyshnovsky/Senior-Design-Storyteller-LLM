        "mainbody": "he Hassitor were an immeasurably ancient race that once inhabited the plane of Acheron. They commanded powerful necromantic magic and skills in stonemasonry, which they combined together to forge the most lasting of their creations, the hassitorium. Beyond these mobile fortresses, the only remnants of their civilization were monuments of bizarre architecture.\nIt wasnt quite clear when exactly the hassitor fell to extinction, but it roughly occurred when the baatezu were still a relatively young race within the multiverse.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff visited the plane of Acheron. There they came upon the hassitorium Ishtavarek and its captain, Estrak Longtooth. When they inquired with the half-orc as to where they were, he told them the name of his hassitorium and of the race that had created these mobile fortresses."
