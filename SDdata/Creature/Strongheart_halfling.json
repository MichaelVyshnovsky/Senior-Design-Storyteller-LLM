        "mainbody": "'''Strongheart halflings''', also known as '''stout halflings''' and '''stoutheart halflings''',<ref> or the '''good folk''' by other races, were a subrace of [[halfling]].",
        "Description": "Strongheart halflings were moderately shorter and stockier than their [[Lightfoot halfling|lightfoot]] kin. Their skin tones and hair colors roughly ranged the same gamut as humans. Though brown, blond, and black hair were most common. Their eyes tended to be blue or green.\n\nBoth male and female stronghearts were incapable of growing beards or mustaches, though they were known to grow sideburns down to mid-cheek. Members of both genders often plaited these sideburns into long braids.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|[[Lightfoot halfling|Lightfoot]], light hearted. Strongheart, strong footing.|Common saying in the Realms.}}\n\nThere was very little that could upset most stronghearts or corrupt them. Their outlook on life stressed cooperation above all else, with one's skill in teamwork being among the most valued of behaviors in their lands. Some races stereotyped them as being fat or lazy due to their sedentary nature and love of fine food. However, they were simply patient as well as very industrious. They put great emphasis on quality.",
        "Biology": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], the eyes of stout halflings were capable of seeing very well in the dark, a sense known as [[infravision]]. Another trait they shared with [[dwarves]] was their innate sense of detecting sloping passageways. They also tended to excel at swimming.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Spellcasting": "Out of all halflings, stronghearts invested the most into the practice of [[magic]] and stationery [[magic item]]s were somewhat common. Many communities had ''[[continual flame]]s'' lighting their town squares at night or walls that repelled the [[arrow]]s of attackers. Spellcasters among them tended to devote their time to improving the lot of their communities."
        },
        "Combat": "Much like lightfoots, many were [[rogue]]s or [[warsling sniper]]s, Compared to lightfoots, [[cleric]]s, [[fighter]]s, [[paladin]]s, and [[ranger]]s were more common and widespread among stronghearts.\n\nLike many halflings, the stout tended to fight with [[short bow]]s, [[sling]]s, small [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[hand axe]]s. However, they were also known to favor [[morningstar]]s. They also utilized equipment uniquely invented by halflings, such as ''[[hornblade (weapon quality)|hornblades]]'' and ''[[wagon shield]]s''.",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Hin Ghostwars]], stronghearts had a largely nomadic hunter-gather society. Following that conflict, they remained in their native [[Luiren]] unlike the lightfoots and over time they became the majority population.\n\nIn [[1371 DR]], sages studying the halfling diaspora in [[Calimshan]] speculated that stout halflings had a trace of dwarven ancestry. In evidence of their theory, they cited old dwarven records from [[Shanatar|Shanatar.]] These told of runaway halfling slaves from the [[Calim Empire]] who took refuge beneath the peaks of the [[Marching Mountains]] and merged with the dwarven communities there-in for several generations before eventually leaving to found their own.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Much like other halflings, stouts were an omnivorous people. They loved [[bread]]s, fruits, vegetables, and the occasional [[pheasant]].",
            "Homelands": "Stout halflings tended to live in temperate hilly, mountainous, or plains regions. Some were known to live in [[Shaar]] and [[Waterdeep]]. However, their race primarily inhabited the halfling homeland of Luiren.\n\nUnlike the ever wandering lightfoot, these halflings sought places where they could permanently settle. They made their best effort to fit into the communities where they settled, becoming an essential part of it.",
            "Languages": "Outside of the [[Halfling language]] and [[Common]], stout halflings were often able to speak [[dwarvish]]. Their race as a whole were largely literate.",
            "Religions": "Strongheart halflings in Luiren tended to worship all members of the [[halfling pantheon]]. However, the most popular deities among Stronghearts across [[Faer√ªn]] were [[Arvoreen]] followed by their patron, the goddess [[Yondalla]]. The worship of Yondalla was especially prominent among those who lived in Luiren. Their [[druid]]s and rangers tended to worship the halfling goddess [[Sheela Peryroyl]].\n\nStronghearts actively discouraged all halflings from worshiping the deities of other races.",
            "Relationships": "Stout halflings tended get along well with [[dwarves]] and enjoyed their company. However, they rarely mixed together with [[elves]] or [[human]]s."
