        "mainbody": "Strongheart halflings, also known as stout halflings and stoutheart halflings, or the good folk by other races, were a subrace of halfling.\nStrongheart halflings were moderately shorter and stockier than their lightfoot kin. Their skin tones and hair colors roughly ranged the same gamut as humans. Though brown, blond, and black hair were most common. Their eyes tended to be blue or green.\nBoth male and female stronghearts were incapable of growing beards or mustaches, though they were known to grow sideburns down to mid-cheek. Members of both genders often plaited these sideburns into long braids.\nThere was very little that could upset most stronghearts or corrupt them. Their outlook on life stressed cooperation above all else, with ones skill in teamwork being among the most valued of behaviors in their lands. Some races stereotyped them as being fat or lazy due to their sedentary nature and love of fine food. However, they were simply patient as well as very industrious. They put great emphasis on quality.\nPrior to the Time of Troubles, the eyes of stout halflings were capable of seeing very well in the dark, a sense known as infravision. Another trait they shared with dwarves was their innate sense of detecting sloping passageways. They also tended to excel at swimming.\nOut of all halflings, stronghearts invested the most into the practice of magic and stationery magic items were somewhat common. Many communities had continual flames lighting their town squares at night or walls that repelled the arrows of attackers. Spellcasters among them tended to devote their time to improving the lot of their communities.\nMuch like lightfoots, many were rogues or warsling snipers, Compared to lightfoots, clerics, fighters, paladins, and rangers were more common and widespread among stronghearts.\nLike many halflings, the stout tended to fight with short bows, slings, small swords, spears, and hand axes. However, they were also known to favor morningstars. They also utilized equipment uniquely invented by halflings, such as hornblades and wagon shields.\nPrior to the Hin Ghostwars, stronghearts had a largely nomadic hunter-gather society. Following that conflict, they remained in their native Luiren unlike the lightfoots and over time they became the majority population.\nIn 1371 DR, sages studying the halfling diaspora in Calimshan speculated that stout halflings had a trace of dwarven ancestry. In evidence of their theory, they cited old dwarven records from Shanatar. These told of runaway halfling slaves from the Calim Empire who took refuge beneath the peaks of the Marching Mountains and merged with the dwarven communities there-in for several generations before eventually leaving to found their own.\nStronghearts lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle. With businesses, families, and even whole clans moving around Luiren.\nMany stout halflings took the up the profession of a jeweler, stonecutter, weaver, woodcutter, potter, basket maker, painter, or farmer. Due to their industrious nature, emphasis on quality, and nimble hands they tended to excel in most of these professions.\nMuch like other halflings, stouts were an omnivorous people. They loved breads, fruits, vegetables, and the occasional pheasant.\nStout halflings tended to live in temperate hilly, mountainous, or plains regions. Some were known to live in Shaar and Waterdeep. However, their race primarily inhabited the halfling homeland of Luiren.\nUnlike the ever wandering lightfoot, these halflings sought places where they could permanently settle. They made their best effort to fit into the communities where they settled, becoming an essential part of it.\nOutside of the Halfling language and Common, stout halflings were often able to speak dwarvish. Their race as a whole were largely literate.\nStrongheart halflings in Luiren tended to worship all members of the halfling pantheon. However, the most popular deities among Stronghearts across Faer√ªn were Arvoreen followed by their patron, the goddess Yondalla. The worship of Yondalla was especially prominent among those who lived in Luiren. Their druids and rangers tended to worship the halfling goddess Sheela Peryroyl.\nStronghearts actively discouraged all halflings from worshiping the deities of other races.\nStout halflings tended get along well with dwarves and enjoyed their company. However, they rarely mixed together with elves or humans.\n* Belamy Lightfingers"
