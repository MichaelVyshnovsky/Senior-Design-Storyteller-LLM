'''Shardcasters''' were crystalline [[construct]] guardians created by the [[star elf|star elves]] of [[Sildëyuir]].

==Description==
Made entirely from [[magic]]ally animated glass or crystal, shardcasters were typically around {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} wide, and could weigh as much as {{SI|4000|lb|k|long=yes}}. The interior of a shardcaster glowed faintly blue, visible through its translucent body.

==Abilities==
Shardcasters could merge their bodies with any surface made from glass or crystal, which made for easy storage&hellip; and allowed them to hide from anyone not under the effect of a [[spell]] of ''[[true seeing]]''. They could manipulate glass and crystal objects into sprouting powerful crystal tentacles, and they could hurl shards of jagged crystal from their bodies&mdash;hence the name "shardcaster". These crystalline constructs were especially vulnerable to sonic energy.

==Behavior==
Utterly mindless automatons, shardcasters could do little more than act in accordance with their creator's commands.

==Combat==
The standard ''modus operandi'' of a shardcaster was to spring from its hiding place within a glass surface to catch intruders by surprise. It would then attempt to use its crystal tentacles to disable foes at a distance while violently slamming those within range of its fists.

==Creation==
The secrets of shardcaster construction were jealously guarded by the star elves. It was a highly complex affair that could only be undertaken by veteran casters that had mastered the spells ''[[animate object]]'', ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', and ''[[Mordenkainen's sword]]''. The body itself was created from a single block of magical crystal or glass, weighing at least {{SI|4500|lb|k|long=yes}}, usually worth around 5,000 [[gp]]. The carving of the body required the services of an expert glassmaker or gemcutter. All in all, creating a single shardcaster cost around 50,000 gp.

==History==
Shardcasters were created by the star elves of Sildëyuir for the specific purpose of guarding their glass citadels.
