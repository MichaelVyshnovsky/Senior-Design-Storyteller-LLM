A lich lord was any lich that deviated from the standard form because of modifications it had made under its own power. Among the Zhentarim beholders, the term referred specifically to the form adopted by Iliph Thraun on achieving lichdom.
For the specific case of Iliph Thraun, the lich lord resembled a hovering skull with white pinpoints of light in its eye sockets.
Iliph Thraun was unique in its need for specially modified spells to sustain itself, and its ability to wield spellfire.
One particular lich lord, Iliph Thraun, had risen ca. 350 DR, a thousand years prior to . The lich achieved its lichdom through a flawed process, and thus required spells to survive. It joined the search for Shandril Shessair in that year, after being brought before Manshoon by Zulthondre, who recommended the lich lord and furnished the means of controlling it. The beholder Xarlraun also had a bauble to control the lich lord.
