        "mainbody": "'''Fire elementals''' were [[elemental]]s formed from the [[Fire|element of fire]].",
        "Description": "They were fast and agile creatures whose touch could set objects aflame. Owing to their fiery nature, they were unable to enter water. They were capable of speaking [[Ignan]] although they rarely spoke.",
        "Biology": "Being elementals, these creatures did not require any air, food, drink, or sleep to survive.\n\nBesides fire, these elementals had [[Wikipedia:en:Ichor|ichor]] flowing through their bodies, which could be used as a magical ingredient.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|4,5}}",
        "Combat": "Fire elementals usually chose to burn opponents with their touch. They attacked ferociously, enjoying burning things in the material plane to cinders. The fire elemental might also slam an opponent, possibly causing them to catch fire.",
        "History": "The fire elemental [[Jogaoh]] was forcibly transported from his home [[plane]] to the world of [[Toril]] by the extraplanar being [[Imgig Zu]]. Employing a [[Lockstone]], Imgig Zu then trapped the powerful fire elemental in the form of a weak dwarf, which in turn bound him to Toril. In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] and [[Priam Agrivar]] brought Jogaoh to the Lockstone, and the magical gem restored him to his true form. Jogaoh returned to his own plane.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka|17, 19}}\n\nA fire elemental emerged from the [[Great Door]] outside [[Waterdeep]] later in 1357 DR. Advised by his assistant [[Dunstanny]], the [[wizard]] [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] used the elemental as a fire source for a ''[[pyrotechnics]]'' spell, causing fireworks that dazzled [[gargoyle]]s and [[kenku (winged)|kenku]]s that also emerged from the Door.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|17-18}}",
        "Society": {
            "Summoning": "These elementals could be summoned to the [[Prime Material plane]] through use of the spells ''[[conjure elemental]]'', ''[[conjure fire elemental]]'', ''[[conjure lesser fire elemental]]'',{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn Game Manual|144}} ''[[Daltim's fiery protector]]'', ''[[elemental servant]]'', ''[[elemental summoning]]''{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal Game Manual|21}} ''[[summon monster III]]'', and ''[[summon monster VI]]''.\n\nThere were also [[magical item]]s that could achieve this, such as a ''[[brazier of commanding fire elementals]]'', ''[[elemental gem]]s'', a ''[[fire elemental gem]]'',  the ''[[Elemental Scourge]]'' in [[Kossuth's House]], the ''[[Incandescent Eye]]'',{{Cite dragon/268/Secrets of the Brotherhood of the True Flame}} the [[Zakharan]] instrument ''[[riqq of the efreet]]'' (but only if played by a [[bard]] or ''[[rawunin]]''),{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight|84-85}} and the ''[[Tome of Twelve Seals]]''.\n\nIn terms of [[divine magic]], the [[specialty priest]]s known as [[firewalker]]s were granted the power to summon a fire elemental once per day or incredibly powerful ones once per [[tenday]] by their deity [[Kossuth]]. Upon reaching a certain level of skill, firewalkers summoned their first fire elemental in a religious ceremony called [[Unity of Fire]].",
            "Relationships": "They were considered [[favored monster]]s, and therefore often used as divine servants, by the following [[deities]]: [[Dumathoin]], [[Flandal Steelskin]], [[Gaerdal Ironhand]], [[Gorm Gulthyn]], or [[Kossuth]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}\n\nThey were often harnessed by [[fire giant]]s as guardians for their strongholds."
