'''White saluqi''' were a rare breed of [[saluqi]] found only in the [[Mountains of Forgotten Dreams]] in the [[High Desert]] of [[west Zakhara]].

==Description==
As their name implied, this breed of saluqi had short white fur. This was a stark contrast to the darker black fur of the common saluqi. They usually stood shorter than a man's knee. They had stubby tails and sharp teeth.

==Activities==
White saluqi were said to be as fast as [[gazelle]]s and, despite their small size, as strong as a [[mule]]. Their endurance allowed them to chase rabbits until their prey dropped from exhaustion. White saluqis were fierce when they needed to be, often standing their ground against much larger animals.

==History==
Because of their unique appearance and hunting skills, white saluqi were prized by both sportsmen and collectors. They made loyal companions if cared for as a pet. A white saluqi could be purchased from a trader for 50 [[dinar]]s in [[Tajar]].
