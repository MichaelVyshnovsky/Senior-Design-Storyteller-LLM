A '''blightspawned creature''' was affected by the supernatural blight brought forth by the [[Rotting Man]].

==Description==
While at first almost normal, the blightspawned slowly blackened, clotted with oozing sores, found their bodily fluids becoming black and oily. Eventually their eyes sank in to become black pits animated with green, malevolent luminescence. Life would eventually desert them completely as they turned undead.

==Abilities==
Granted horrid vitality and frightful strength by their condition, the blightspawned were also immune to anything that plants could endure, though dimmed somewhat. Within months, their condition progressed into complete undeath, turning them into [[juju zombie]]s.

==Personality==
Blightspawned creatures loathed anything clean and whole, seeking to spread their horrid poison for the Rotting Man.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|35}}

==Combat==
The blightspawned carried a terrible supernatural disease that could not be healed by normal means. Animals or plants that succumbed to it wouldd become blightspawned themselves.

==History==
By {{yearlink|1372}}, the blightspawned were central to the forces of the Rotting Man, and servants to many blightlords.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|82}} They protected [[Dun-Tharos]] for them{{cite book/Unapproachable East|86}} and they had been part of the force that leveled [[Denderdale]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|125}} Their presence in the [[Rawlinswood]] had also made it a dangerous proposition to trap animals or log for wood there.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|118}}{{cite book/Unapproachable East|191}}

In {{yearlink|1373}}, a force of blighted [[volodni]] attacked [[Fullpoint]]{{cite book/Lady of Poison|12-13|2}} in search of [[Araluen]], bringing a blightspawned [[dire lion]] with them.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|28|4}} More of the blighted numbered amongst the forces of the blightlord [[Gameliel]] in the [[Mucklestones]]{{cite book/Lady of Poison|78-79|9}} and amongst the personal guard of the Rotting Man in [[The Close]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|281|30}}

==Notable Blightspawned==
* [[Molkai]]
