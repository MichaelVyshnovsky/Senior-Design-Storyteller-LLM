        "mainbody": "Sand cats were a species of felines found in deserts.\nSand cats were slightly larger than a house cat. Their fur was colored in a way that allowed them to blend in with the desert. Their most distinguishing physical features were their large ears, each ending in a long tuft of white fur.\nSand cats had the ability to jump  vertically and  horizontally. Sand cats were incredibly stealthy and their senses were very sensitive, making it near impossible to sneak up on one.\nA sand cat attacked prey by pouncing on its target, pinning the prey with its teeth and front claws and raking the belly with its sharp rear claws. Sand cats only attacked larger creatures such as humanoids if they were cornered and retreated at the first chance.\nSand cats were social creatures and lived together in familial groups called dens. Each den had two adults and their kittens. Sand cats mated once a year, and the parents remained with the kittens until they reached maturity, which usually took up to ten months.\nSand cats were obligate carnivores and nocturnal hunters. They played an essential part in their local areas, as they kept the population of rodents and vermin under control.\nSand cats lived in small caves or burrows in deserts or steppes. They were territorial and hunted an area with a range of up to . They could also be found around the Battle of Bones battlefield in the Western Heartlands.\nSand cats could be somewhat domesticated and were kept as pets. They were trained as kittens to hunt prey for their owner. Sand cat kittens were gifted to the leaders of human tribes. A sand cat kitten could be bought for up to 2,000 gp at a market."
