Daerag was a rare predator from eastern reaches of Amn in the Lands of Intrigue.
By the 15 century DR, daerag beasts were exceedingly rare and believed to be extinct by some. The creatures maw inspired a geometrical design of the same name that was in use on Amns pennants and banners at least through the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
