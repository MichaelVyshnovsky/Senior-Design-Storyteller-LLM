        "mainbody": "Water genasi were a type of genasi with elemental water ancestry.\nMost water genasi were descended from marid genies, although a few had other origins, including some who were descended from the goddess Umberlee. Like other genasi, water genasi looked generally human except for some distinguishing features, such as lightly scaled skin, clammy flesh, blue-green hair, excessive perspiration, blue-black eyes, or a muffled voice that sounds as if drowned in water. Compared with other genasi, water genasi were often slightly more durable, but also less strong.\nMost genasi had a lifespan identical to that of humans.\nWater genasi were unusually patient for genasi and had a strongly independent streak. Most were used to solving problems on their own and not afraid to take a lot of time doing so. At times they were like terrible storms, fierce and destructive, but most often they presented a tranquil appearance despite whatever emotions run underneath their quiet surface. Water genasi were often abandoned by their human parents and raised by aquatic creatures such as aquatic elves, dolphins, locathah, merfolk, sahuagin, or even aboleths.  Water genasi usually leave their parents upon reaching maturity, taking to the open sea in order to explore, learn and develop their own personality and place in the world.\nA great many water genasi felt that they were unique and superior to the humans that bore them, and they had little or no interest in others of their kind. Only in large communities of sea elves were more than one water genasi likely to spend much time together. Many water genasi even looked down on humans who used the sea as their means to a livelihood, seeing them as vulnerable and weak fools. This brash arrogance means that, in general, water genasi did not get along as well with other races.\nMost water genasi had no particular bent in alignment, preferring to avoid extremes.\nBecause of their few numbers and varied origins, water genasi had no society or culture to call their own. Many water genasi were also raised by aquatic elves and sometimes demonstrated values similar to those of the race such as freedom or good behavior. Others were raised by sahuagin and became bloodthirsty killers and the difference between water genasi of different upbringings was sometimes compared to the difference between a quiet spring and a raging waterfall.\nOdd as it may seem, few water genasi enjoyed the presence of other water genasi, as it made them feel less unique and special. As a whole, water genasi avoided others of their race to an extent not common amongst other manifestations, who tend to view one another as kin and would-be brothers and sisters. Few water genasi married other water genasi, making the variant one of the rarest genasi varieties, and many water genasi were actually the result of individuals whose parents were not water genasi but who had one or more distant ancestors who were. This lonely, isolationist behavior made most water genasi poor leaders.\nLike all genasi, water genasi felt a draw to both arcane magic and elemental magic but a great many also felt drawn to the ways of divine or even primal magic. Most water genasi spellcasters were clerics or druids and relatively few had the talent for sorcery. Many genasi wizards favored conjuration as a school of specialization, as it allowed them to summon other water elementals to their side.\nWater genasi had no common racial deity due to their varied origins but there were some tendencies amongst the subrace. For the many water genasi raised amongst aquatic elves, for instance, Deep Sashelas was a natural choice for worship. Many of the gods genasi devoted serve as emissaries and go-betweens for the aquatic elves and their land-bound cousins. Another common subject of worship, Istishia, besides drawing attention due to his status as a primordial, was also appealing to water genasi due to his flexible nature and message of overcoming obstacles over time. Worshipers of the primordial were often mediators who intercede between groups who share the same water.\nOthers choose other gods to worship. Some water genasi worshiped Auril the Frostmaiden.  These individuals typically favored cold weather and enjoyed swimming beside seals and other similar creatures in arctic waters. Many even acquired cold-based monsters as pets or made friends with the frost giants. Valkur appealed to those few water genasi who got along well with human sailors and who had an affinity for boats and the gods worshipers were much welcomed amongst ship crews.\nSome evil water genasi worshiped Umberlee, who is said to have spawned a bloodline of water genasi herself, and these individuals could be the cruelest individuals of their race. Many evil water genasi, particularly those from Chessenta, Mulhorand, or Unther, were also drawn to the worship of Sebek, sometimes becoming werecrocodile servants of the god. Another god commonly worshiped was Eldath, who appealed to introspective and more placid individuals. Her worshipers were commonly peace-loving beings, making them a favorite prey of the deity Malar.\nWater genasi, like all genasi, could be found throughout all of Faer√ªn but they were most common in certain locations, often tied to the water. Many water genasi were found around the Sea of Fallen Stars, particularly in the Vilhon Reach, along the Dragon Coast, or in Sembia, Aglarond, or Chessenta.\n*Azar, a minion of Vestress until she killed her, following Liriel and helping her on occasions.\n* Spider Parrafin, a halfling water genasi (although technically not a genasi because he was not human).\n* Shoalar Quanderil"
