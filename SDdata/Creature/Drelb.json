        "mainbody": "relbs, otherwise known as Haunting Custodians, were a type of wraith-like creature that were native to the Negative Energy plane.\nThe appearance of these creatures was indistinguishable from a wraith. However, despite this resemblance they were not a type of undead.\nDespite their resemblance to wraiths these creatures could not be turned. Nor could they be harmed by silver weapons, unless enchanted.\nWhenever any form of psionic power was used within  of a drelb, or a psionic attack was directed against them within that range, the drelb was capable of either imitating that effect or reflecting them back upon their user.\nDrelbs were also capable of making their bodies appear gradually farther away, while in actuality they were moving closer towards someone. This illusory effect served the purpose of tricking opponents into thinking they were retreating. They typically used this ability when their opponents were hesitant and when clerics attempted to cast turn undead on them.\nWhen engaging creatures in combat, drelbs would inflict a temporary condition known as \"nether chill\" upon their opponents. This caused their bodies to collapse to the ground, dropping everything they are holding, and become overcome with an overwhelming shivering. Even those with strongest of wills could not overcome this effect and victims were unable to do anything until the chill passed.\nIn the 14 century DR, a number of drelbs resided within Mithral Hall under the control of the shadow dragon Shimmergloom. During this century, they were also known to be very rarely encountered in the city of Waterdeep.\nIt was very rare to find drelbs outside of their native plane.\nWhenever they were on the Prime Material plane, drelbs were only active during twilight hours.\nDrelbs only spoke their own unique language, though they were capable of understanding simple phrases spoken in common.\nEvil-aligned spellcasters were known to occasionally summon them to the Prime Material to act as guardians, typically of concealed treasure or places meant to be secret."
