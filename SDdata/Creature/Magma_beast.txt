Magma beasts were a variety of elemental composed of magma that originated in the Elemental Chaos.
These creatures varied in their level of intelligence, with brutes and hurlers being the smartest.
All magma beasts were immune to the effects of petrification, had some resistance to fire, and were particularly vulnerable to cold-based spells and abilities.
Following the Spellplague, many magma beasts made their way through elemental vortices and planar rifts into volcanic regions that were on Toril and within its Underdark.
In 1479 DR, all four types of magma beast could be found inhabiting Mount Hotenow. There many served in the fighting forces of the Cult of Maegera.
* Magma brute
* Magma claw
* Magma hurler
* Magma strider
All magma beasts were capable of speaking the Primordial language.
Brutes and hurlers could be bribed with regular offerings of food. They occasionally bullied claws and striders into fighting alongside them.
All magma beasts were sometimes lured into serving fire archons, fire giants, salamanders, or even an eye of flame.
These creatures could subsist on merely clay, ores, and even minor elementals, though they preferred to hunt and feast upon organic creatures, savoring the taste of burned flesh. Whenever they killed a humanoid they would devour them whole, including their equipment.
