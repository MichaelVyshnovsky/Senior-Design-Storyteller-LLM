'''Nehwon ghouls''' were transparent-bodied creatures from the world of [[Nehwon]]. They were unrelated to the more familiar [[ghoul]]s.

==Description==
The "crystal flesh" of Nehwon ghouls was transparent, rendering their pinkish skeletons visible.

==Personality==
Nehwon ghouls generally considered themselves to be more civilized than others and saw cannibalizing [[human]]s, turning them into more of their clear-bodied kin, as an altruistic act.

Occasionally, Nehwon ghouls would break free of their customs, joining [[human]] adventuring bands.

==Combat==
Nehwon ghouls were similar to humans in terms of combat prowess. Their transparent bodies made locating their vital spots difficult.

==Notable==
The axe-wielding [[Lacheera]], companion to [[Tamper Tencoin]] when he fought [[Whisper]] alongside the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], was a Nehwon ghoul.
