Nehwon ghouls were transparent-bodied creatures from the world of Nehwon. They were unrelated to the more familiar ghouls.
The "crystal flesh" of Nehwon ghouls was transparent, rendering their pinkish skeletons visible.
Nehwon ghouls generally considered themselves to be more civilized than others and saw cannibalizing humans, turning them into more of their clear-bodied kin, as an altruistic act.
Occasionally, Nehwon ghouls would break free of their customs, joining human adventuring bands.
Nehwon ghouls were similar to humans in terms of combat prowess. Their transparent bodies made locating their vital spots difficult.
The axe-wielding Lacheera, companion to Tamper Tencoin when he fought Whisper alongside the Knights of Myth Drannor, was a Nehwon ghoul.
