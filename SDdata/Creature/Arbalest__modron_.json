        "mainbody": "An arbalest was a special kind of quadrone modron, shaped something like the weapon of the same name.\nAn arbalest looked like a giant repeating crossbow, with mechanical wings and four legs. Their bodies shot out metal crossbow bolts.\nBesides appearance, arbalests functioned in a similar manner to other quadrones.\nTwelve arbalests were known to guard the Simulacrux, a trench and archway within a vast cavern of Trobriands Graveyard in Undermountain. They had shot and killed two ogres, who were part of a band of hobgoblins led by Captain Kurlog. Kurlog was eager for help defeating the modrons so that he could defeat Zox Clammersham."
