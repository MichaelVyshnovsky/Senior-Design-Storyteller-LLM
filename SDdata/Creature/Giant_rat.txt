'''Giant rats''', also known as '''dire rats''', were a species of large rodent.

==Description==
Giant rats were much larger than the common [[rat]], most growing to the size of a large dog. They were covered in coarse fur that was brown-black in color.

==Combat==
Giant rats worked exceptionally well in groups, taking advantage of their numbers to attack more efficiently. They attacked a target by biting them with its sharp incisors. Giant rats avoided attacking stronger creatures, especially those wielding fire, unless driven by extreme hunger or compelled to do so by a [[wererat]] or [[vampire]]. Giant rats were excellent swimmers, as such they were just as dangerous in the water as they were on land. 

The bite of these creatures carried a potentially lethal disease known as [[filth fever]]. It was recommended that victims of giant rat bites sought immediate [[cleric]]al attention.

==Ecology==
Giant rats were common found in subterranean areas such as crypts, dungeons and sewers. They were also found in great numbers within graveyards, where they dug a network of tunnel to gain access to the corpses found within.

Some were raised to be mounts by the [[Tasloi]], alongside [[spider eaters]].
===Habitats===
Giant rats could be found in the wild in the [[Silver Marches]], particularly in the [[Rauvin Vale]] and [[Sundabar Vale]], as well as in the [[High Forest]]. In urban environments they were commonly found in [[sewer]]s,{{Cite dragon/238/The Dragon's Bestiary: Spawn of the Sewers|72}} though they were liable to migrate elsewhere if a [[water cat]] moved into their territory.{{Cite dragon/238/The Dragon's Bestiary: Spawn of the Sewers|72}}

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], giant rats could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].
