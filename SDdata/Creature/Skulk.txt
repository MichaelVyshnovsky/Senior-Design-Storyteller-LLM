'''Skulks''' were a species closely related to [[human]]s.<ref>

==Society==
===Diet===
Like the humans they descended from, skulks were an omnivorous people. They typically preferred to steal their food, rather than developing skills in agriculture or brewing.{{Cite dragon/241/Legacies of the Suel Imperium|49}}
===Homelands===
Beyond [[Toril]], these beings were known to be found on the planet of [[Oerth]] where they had came about by different means, but possibly around the same time as skulks came about on Toril.

==History==
Skulks originally descended from a tribe of nomadic [[human]]s who had wandered [[Calimshan]] after the defeat of the [[Djen]]. They were abducted by [[drow]] and forced into servitude in the city of [[Guallidurth]] for centuries, their descendants kept passive by their fear of the darkness surrounding them and over the generations became [[albino]]s.{{Cite dragon/241/Legacies of the Suel Imperium|48}} They finally escaped when a giant lizard appeared from the darkness, drove off the drow overseers, and led the slaves away. The lizard was an avatar of [[Ibrandul]] known as the Stalker and through it, the humans learned his worship.{{Cite dragon/241/Legacies of the Suel Imperium|47}}

While some of these men and women returned to the surface to spread Ibrandul's faith, the rest remained in the [[Underdark]], surviving by raiding the farms and caravans of Guallidurth as well as those of human settlements on the surface. Over time (and continued use of a particular spell provided by their god) these people became the known as skulks and could thereafter be found living near many entrances to the Underdark.
