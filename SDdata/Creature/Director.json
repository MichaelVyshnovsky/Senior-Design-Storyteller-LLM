        "mainbody": "irectors were beholder abominations that served as hive shock troops.\nThe director was extremely large, being around 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter. Its central eye was proportionately smaller than that of a true beholder. Directors possessed only six eyestalks atop their bodies and three clawed tentacles located on their undersides. They used these tentacles to ride their mounts.\nA directors primary function was as a cavalry fighter. They possessed a mind-link with specialized riding animals.\nCalishite records suggest that directors may have fought in the Eye Tyrant Wars and earlier wars in Calimshan, along with other beholder abominations."
