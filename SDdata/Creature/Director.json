        "Description": "The director was extremely large, being around 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter. Its central eye was proportionately smaller than that of a true beholder. Directors possessed only six eyestalks atop their bodies and three clawed tentacles located on their undersides. They used these tentacles to ride their mounts.",
        "Society": "A director's primary function was as a cavalry fighter. They possessed a mind-link with specialized riding animals.",
        "History": "[[Calimshan|Calishite]] records suggest that directors may have fought in the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]] and earlier wars in [[Calimshan]], along with other beholder abominations."
