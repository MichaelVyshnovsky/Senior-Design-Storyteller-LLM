'''Flux slaads''' were an uncommon variety of [[slaadi]] that emerged in the [[Elemental Chaos]] following the [[Spellplague]]. They were generally smaller and weaker than other varieties of slaadi, garnering them little respect among their peers.

==Personality==
A flux slaad completely lacked any sense of self-awareness or self-preservation. Their actions were blindly motivated by a desire to cause chaos and carnage, often beset by unpredictable and violent rages.

==Ability==
Unlike other slaadi, a flux slaad lacked the ability to reproduce. They could teleport short distances and could see in areas of [[low-light vision|low light]]. Their monikor of "flux" derived from their resistances and vulnerabilites towards various [[element]]s and elemental energies always being in a state of flux, such as cold, [[fire]], lighting, [[psionic]] energy, [[necrotic energy]], and sound. Whenever they were injured by one of these, they would become resistant to it and something else would in-turn becoming its vulnerability.

==Combat==
These slaadi solely fought with the use of their claws.

==Society==
A flux slaad occasionally slipped by accident through [[portal]]s, commonly ending up near gatherings of [[bullywug]]s. They would often make themselves revered rulers over the bullywugs and showed great restraint in harming their subjects.
===Languages===
Flux slaads spoke both [[Common]] and [[Primordial]].
