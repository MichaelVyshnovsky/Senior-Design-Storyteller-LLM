        "mainbody": "'''Docenti''' ({{Singular|Docentos}}) were powerful and dangerous [[aberration]]s.",
        "Description": "Docenti were roughly insectoid in form, with aspects of both centipedes and earwigs, but they had a humanoid torso and four arms. The chitin plates on the body were golden-brown in color. The face was partly humanoid, but the aberrations had large compound eyes and long antenna.",
        "Behavior": "Docenti were violent and unpredictable; in groups, they were non-cohesive and unorganized.",
        "Abilities": "Docenti were dangerous, but lacking in magical abilities. They did have [[darkvision]], [[low-light vision]], and [[tremorsense]], as well as having a keen sense of smell. They were also adept at climbing and burrowing.",
        "Combat": "Docenti were potent foes, for they could wield a weapon, typically an appropriately sized [[shortspear]], in each of their four hands, as well as being able to attack and hold onto enemies with their tail. They were also known to bite. In combat, they preferred to grab and hold the first enemy, then rely on their swords to repel would-be rescuers.",
        "Ecology": "Docenti were said to be born of desert sands when blood was spilled thereon in malice or cold murder, though whether this was true or mere rumor was unknown. Nonetheless, they were nomads native to hot deserts, where the one constant that bound docenti society together was violence.\n\nDocenti understood, but did not speak, [[Common]]. They were not, in fact, known to speak any languages at all.\n\nDocenti reproduced by transforming captured [[humanoid]]s or [[monstrous humanoid]]s with their venom. The venom sapped a creature's mental willpower, and, if the victim could not withstand it, they would fall into a coma for several hours, during which they transformed into a docentos. Docenti retained no memory of their lives prior to transforming, but some did retain minor identifying marks. The transformation could only be reversed by ''[[miracle]]'' or ''[[wish]]''."
