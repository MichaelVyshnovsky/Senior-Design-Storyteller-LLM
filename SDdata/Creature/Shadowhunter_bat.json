        "Description": "These creatures had very gaunt bodies that terminated in a long tail, which was flat and bristling with spikes.",
        "Behavior": "Shadowhunter bats were very fierce predators and would attack other creatures without any provocation. Being more adapted to flying, they were quite clumsy when walking.",
        "Combat": "These creatures preferred to lurk in the shadows, striking their foes when they least expected it. They would then attempt to flee before their opponent could have an opportunity to retaliate and hide once more to repeat the process.\n\nWhen fighting in dim light, or preferably complete darkness, shadowhunter bats tended to fight more fiercely.",
        "History": "Following an earthquake caused by the [[Spellplague]], a rift opened up in the first level of [[Undermountain]] and shadowhunter bats quickly took to the area as a lair.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "These creatures were typically seen lingering near places that were touched by the Shadowfell.",
            "Relationships": "Shadowhunter bats sometimes served other [[Shadow creature|shadow creatures]] or [[undead]], and [[vampire]]s."
