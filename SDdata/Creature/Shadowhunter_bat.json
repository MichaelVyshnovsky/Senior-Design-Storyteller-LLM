        "mainbody": "Shadowhunter bats were a type of monstrous bat connected to the Shadowfell.\nThese creatures had very gaunt bodies that terminated in a long tail, which was flat and bristling with spikes.\nShadowhunter bats were very fierce predators and would attack other creatures without any provocation. Being more adapted to flying, they were quite clumsy when walking.\nThese creatures preferred to lurk in the shadows, striking their foes when they least expected it. They would then attempt to flee before their opponent could have an opportunity to retaliate and hide once more to repeat the process.\nWhen fighting in dim light, or preferably complete darkness, shadowhunter bats tended to fight more fiercely.\nFollowing an earthquake caused by the Spellplague, a rift opened up in the first level of Undermountain and shadowhunter bats quickly took to the area as a lair.\nShadowhunter bats lived and hunted either solitarily or in colonies.\nThese creatures were typically seen lingering near places that were touched by the Shadowfell.\nShadowhunter bats sometimes served other shadow creatures or undead, and vampires."
