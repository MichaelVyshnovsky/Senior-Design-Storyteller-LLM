'''Flesh seeker ghouls''' were a unique type of [[ghoul]] within the Realms. They only arose from the bodies of mortal followers of [[Orcus]] that had undergone a horrific, cannibalistic initiation into the [[demon lord]]â€™s cult.

==Combat==
These ghouls typically took a stealthy approach, whether they were in a battle or stalking an individual. Hanging back in the shadows, waiting to leap out and pin their victims to the ground. Besides rendering their victims with their claws, flesh seekers often had a [[dagger]].

==History==
Following the [[Spellplague]], flesh seekers could be found in the [[Shadowfell]] within the city of [[Evernight]], a reflection of the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]].

==Ecology==
===Relationships===
These creatures traditionally served Orcus, though could be made to fight alongside anyone that could supply them with a steady stream of victims.
