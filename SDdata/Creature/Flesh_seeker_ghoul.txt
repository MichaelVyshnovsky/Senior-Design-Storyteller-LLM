Flesh seeker ghouls were a unique type of ghoul within the Realms. They only arose from the bodies of mortal followers of Orcus that had undergone a horrific, cannibalistic initiation into the demon lord’s cult.
These ghouls typically took a stealthy approach, whether they were in a battle or stalking an individual. Hanging back in the shadows, waiting to leap out and pin their victims to the ground. Besides rendering their victims with their claws, flesh seekers often had a dagger.
Following the Spellplague, flesh seekers could be found in the Shadowfell within the city of Evernight, a reflection of the city of Neverwinter on the Prime Material world of Toril.
These creatures traditionally served Orcus, though could be made to fight alongside anyone that could supply them with a steady stream of victims.
