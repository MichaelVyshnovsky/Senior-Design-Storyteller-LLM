        "Description": "These creatures were roughly the same size as a [[moose]], with their bodies standing up to {{SI|7|ft}} tall and being {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length. They had antlers that spread out to {{SIrange|10|12|ft|long=yes}} in length and that weighed around {{SI|100|lbs|k}}.\n\nThe typical megaloceros had a fast gait.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were typically non-aggressive, but could be dangerous to others in the early spring when mating season occurred. During that time males became extremely aggressive and territorial, while females around that same season became more defensive of their young.\n\nWhen moving they often made very sudden shifts in the direction they were going, a manner of movement that some considered jarring.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Biological": "A megaloceros could carry and haul heavy loads. A small load for them was roughly up to {{SI|400|lbs|k}}, medium loads were in a range of {{SIrange|401|800|lbs|k}}, and heavy loads were in a range of {{SIrange|801|1200|lbs|k}}. And though they could not carry, these creatures were capable of dragging over {{SI|6000|lbs|k}}."
        },
        "Combat": "The megaloceros would charge at the most obvious and brightly colored threat, defending itself by goring opponents with its huge antlers. These creatures would also scoop up opponents with their antlers, toss them around, and try to trample them.\n\n[[File:Megaloceros-2e.png|thumb|273px]]",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "The megaloceros was a herbivorous species.",
            "Habitats": "These creatures were typically found in temperate forests or cold climate marshes.\n\nOn [[Toril]], they could be found in the moors and coniferous forests of the [[Moonshae Isles]].",
            "Relationships": "Some races were known to use the megaloceros as a [[mount]], such as by [[neanderthal]]s, [[Snow elf|snow elves]], and arctic [[druid]]s. It took roughly four weeks at the least to train a megaloceros to be a mount. [[Ysgardian dwarf|Midgard dwarves]] were known to use them as pack animals. And arctic druids sometimes had them as an [[animal companion]]. \n\nSome neanderthals and [[snow goblin]]s were known to revere the megaloceros as a [[totem]] animal, referring to it as the \"Great Snow Elk.\"\n\nIn the wild they were often hunted by [[saber-toothed tiger]]s.",
            "Usage": "Many creatures sought after their large antlered skulls as a decoration for their lairs, hunting lodges, or castles."
