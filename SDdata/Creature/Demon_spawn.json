As a result, they often sought out [[demongate]]s to bring forth their kin to the world. Demon spawn were the products of dark rituals and were often the end result of the work of a [[hag]]. Demon spawn varied greatly in appearance, but it was certain was that they were shunned by their families and communities and, as a result, held nothing but contempt in their hearts as they attempted to better understand their inherent abilities.",
