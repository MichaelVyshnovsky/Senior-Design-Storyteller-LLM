        "mainbody": "Elemental liches were a form of lichdom achievable only by elementalists.\nDuring the days of Netheril, a group of mages banded together to defeat a demilich known as Kangaxx. Unable to fully destroy him, the mages were forced to become liches themselves in order to imprison him. One of these mages became an elemental lich.\nIn 1369 DR, Gorions Ward was tricked by the imprisoned demilich into retrieving his golden skeletal torso from the Netherese elemental lich.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, these liches could be found in the Domains of Dread."
