'''Sea snakes''', also known as '''sea serpents''' or '''water snakes''', were an aquatic species of [[viper]] that sometimes grew so large as to be considered

==Behavior==
Sea snakes largely ignored other creatures, attacking only when they were hungry or disturbed. Like any snake they feared [[fire]] and would retreat from open flames. They had a basic level of intelligence typical of animals.

==Abilities==
These creatures had a [[poison|venomous]] bite. When underwater a membrane on their snouts sealed their nostrils, allowing them to dive to great depths.

==Combat==
Sea snakes were one of the few species of snake to both have a poisonous bite and attack by means of constriction. Smaller varieties of them would simply inject their venom and then withdraw, waiting for it to take effect. While the largest of sea snakes were capable of coiling about small vessels and gradually crushing them through constriction. 

==Ecology==
Like most snakes, these creatures lived solitary lives. However, on rare occasions there were instances of them gathering in large masses of hundreds or even thousands, often {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}} wide and {{SI|30|miles|long=yes}} long. The reason for this was unknown. Some speculated that it may have been due to seasonal migrations, others that it might have been a mating ritual.

===Diet===
Like nearly all species of snake, these creatures were a carnivorous species.

===Habitats===
Giant sea snakes were found only in the seas and oceans of tropical regions. Smaller varieties of this creature could be found in shallow waters.

Around [[Faerûn]], these creatures inhabited the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and could be found near [[Waterdeep]]. In the lands of [[Kara-Tur]], they inhabited the tropical and subtropical oceans, such as the [[Yellow Sea]]. As well as the southern portion of the [[Fenghsintzu River]] in [[T'u Lung]] and in the [[Ular River]] in [[Shou Lung]]'s [[Kutuk Valley]].

===Relationships===
Some sea snakes acted as servants of the [[marid]] [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].

Some aquatic [[spirit shaman]]s had sea snakes as [[animal companion]]s.

===Usages===
[[Bandolier]]s, belts, and harnesses made from the treated skin of sea snakes was common among all the sentient creatures of [[Serôs]]. Their scales were also a required [[material component]] for the ''[[oars to snakes]]'' [[spell]].

The bodies of these creatures were edible and considered delicacies by certain aquatic races of [[Serôs]]. One establishment known to serve fried sea snake was the [[Fiery Flagon]] in Waterdeep.

==Notable Sea Snakes==
* [[Shipwrecker]], a sea snake that was owned by the [[sha'ir]] [[Khadiga]].

==Trivia==
* Some of the pillars in [[The Singing Siren]] had sea serpent shapes carved into them.
