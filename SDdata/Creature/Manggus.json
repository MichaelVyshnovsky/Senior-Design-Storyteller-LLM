        "mainbody": "A '''manggus''' was an evil spirit that lived on the steppes of the [[Hordelands]]. They used their power to frighten others and demand sacrifices.",
        "Description": "A manggus stood as tall as an [[ogre]], but its skin hung in flaps about its body. They had bloodshot eyes and wept tears of blood. Four large fangs dominated its mouth. All manggus were capable of shapechanging.",
        "Combat": "During a rare occurrence when a manggus fights in its natural form, they attack with a bite and hand-held weapon, typically a large maul. Manggus fight with ferocity, but will retreat if they feel the battle has turned against them.\n\nManggus are generally found in the form of a human, though they were able to shapechange into any creature that they had seen.\n\nAll manggus could use the following [[spell]]-like abilities: ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[cause fear]]''. They could also cause [[disease]] per touch.\n\nThey were immune to charm and hold spells and cold-based magic. Damage from fire caused a manggus to revert back to its natural form. Magical weapons were needed to harm them.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "All manggus were predators of [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s. They usually avoided larger cities to minimize the chance of discovery.",
            "Relationships": "Manggus preferred to use trickery to get close to humans, even ruling over small villages and demanding sacrifices. They would prey upon travelers or small farms as well. When danger or threat of discovery was suspected, a manggus would move to a new location."
