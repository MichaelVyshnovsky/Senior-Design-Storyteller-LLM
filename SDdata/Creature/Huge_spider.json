In [[the North]] they could be found in parts of [[Cormanthor]]'s forests and the [[Rat Hills]].\n\nIn the [[Hordelands]] they were quite common in the [[Ama Basin]] and [[Hagga Shan]]. Elsewhere in the region of [[Kara-tur]], they could be found in the forests of [[Akari|Akari island]]. In the land of [[Maztica]] they could be found in many hills and mountains. In the [[Zakhara]] region's [[Crowded Sea]], they could be found on the island chain of [[Nada al-Hazan]].",
