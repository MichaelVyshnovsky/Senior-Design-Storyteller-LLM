        "mainbody": "'''Con-tinh''' were a race of lesser [[spirit]]s greatly feared in [[Kara-Tur]], who were formed when a young woman died early in life.",
        "Description": "Con-tinh were beautiful [[humanoid]] women who wore elegant silk robes, the clothing of princesses. They often carried a large fan and/or a basket of fruit. Occasionally, she was seen with her [[familiar]]s, often cranes or light-blue [[dove]]s.",
        "Abilities": "The laugh of a con-tinh could drive a listener to madness.\n\nOnce a night,  a con-tinh had the ability to possess the body of a nearby humanoid. The possession was only in effect within {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} from her tree.\n\nIt was not possible for a con-tinh to pass through [[jade]] or [[crystal]], nor could it pick up items made from these materials.",
        "Combat": "The singular purpose of a con-tinh was to destroy all life. She was especially obsessed with killing members of her former race. A con-tinh attacked with her evil laugh, up to three times a night. A con-tinh would send her familiars to scout for potential victims, who mistook the familiars as a good omen and then were lured to the con-tinh's tree. \n\nOnly strong weapons were able to harm a con-tinh. Her tree was her main weak spot: any attack, including magical attacks, on her tree would cause damage to the con-tinh. Spells such as ''[[wood rot]]'' would destroy both the tree and the con-tinh. There was still a risk in attacking a con-tinh's tree, as the humanoid who destroyed her tree had a chance of suffering an ''[[ancient curse]]'' spell.",
        "Society": "The [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] created a con-tinh from the spirit of a young woman who died as a result of a wrong-doing. For example, a woman who was murdered by a jealous spouse.",
        "Ecology": "Con-tinh were often created as a result of an adulterous love affair ending in a maiden's murder.\n\nLike many Kara-Turan spirits, the life-force of a con-tinh was connected to a specific tree. A con-tinh was unable to venture farther than {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} from her tree. If the con-tinh's tree was destroyed in any way, she was also instantly destroyed.\n\n[[Wu jen]] and [[shugenja]] collected the fruit from a con-tinh's tree, which was dried and ground into a dust to be used as a [[material component]] in a ''[[potion of longevity]]''.\n\nThe hills near [[Gensuyama]], a volcano in [[Kozakura]], were home to a number of con-tinh.",
        "Notable Con-Tinh": "* [[w:c:ravenloft:Scream (person)|Scream]], [[w:c:ravenloft:Hate (person)|Hate]], and [[w:c:ravenloft:Spite (person)|Spite]]: The three evil daughters of [[Tsien Chiang]] of [[I'Cath]] and unique forms of con-tinh created after she trapped their spirits in corrupted sacred bells, to which they were tied, rather than trees."
