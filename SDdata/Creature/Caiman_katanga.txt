Caiman katanga were a water-dwelling species of katanga found in the rivers and lakes of the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur.
Katanga were intelligent animal shapechangers who could take on the shape of a beast as well as appear in a hybrid form. In humanoid form, caiman katanga retained thick and leathery skin with a texture similar to that of a mundane caiman. Additionally, even in their Nubari form, caiman katanga showed small stubby  tails at the base of their lower backs. In their animal form they greatly resembles crocodiles.
One notable feature of all katanga, regardless of the form they took, was that the shadow they cast was always that of the animal.
Not surprisingly, caiman katanga were great swimmers and hunters who relied on their predatorial instinct.
Despite similarities with werebeasts, katanga were not lycanthropes and did not share their strengths or vulnerabilities. All katanga appeared to be ordinary natural animals when detected or examined via magic. In their animal form, caiman katanga could only communicate with others of their kin and rendered themselves unable to use magic.
Katanga could change their shape a limited number of times per day, depending on their experience and strength.
In battle, they used the benefits of each of their forms. Their strong jaws landed deadly bites, and strong tails were used to stun their opponents with. Their tough hides offered great resistance to damage and resilience. Most caimans were trained and wielded halfspears.
Caiman katangas stereotypical personality trait was selfishness. Most of these creatures showed self-centeredness and cared only about protecting their territory from all other intelligent creatures. Those caimans who ventured into adventuring lives often showed tolerance of other cultures and empathy to their allies, despite still being quite aggressive and fierce creatures.
Most caiman katanga encountered in the wild were individual hunters. They were territorial beings who lived relying on hunters instinct, denouncing civilization and the Nubari cultures. Caimans often stayed in the animal form, coming together into larger groups twice a year to mate. The mating rituals took place in spring and autumn. After the females laid eggs, katanga returned to their homes.
Despite their solitude, some caiman katanga sought out the lives of adventuring, leaving their homes and communities for the Nubari villages, where they joined adventuring groups. Most commonly, such individuals took on the roles of warriors and hunters.
Caiman katanga spoke their own Caiman language that resembled grunts and growls of the caiman beast. Those who ventured into the wider Living Jungle learned Malatran common language.
They showed little interest in religion or spirituality. Those individuals who did often venerated Malatran nature spirits.
These predators could be found in virtually any river or lake on the Malatran Plateau. 
Friendly caiman katanga who dwelt in the waters of the Sleepy Lake, to the southwest of the Fire Mountain, were believed to protect the peaceful Nubari Zantira tribes that made homes atop lake rafts. Some Zantirans believed that the lakes caiman katanga saved the water spirit protector Jungrna, who instructed the shapeshifters to protect the Raft Dweller humans.
Vile bands of the caiman katanga were known to occasionally raid peaceful Koshiva tribes of the Living Jungle. River tamhi harbored a distrust of caiman katanga as they often enough consumed the tamhi young.
Some 20 years before the Year of Awakening, Malatran Calendar (late 14 century DR), the chieftain of then Saiyama tribe, Toloka, was killed alongside his family by a band of malicious caiman katanga. Tolokas death led to the tribes renaming honoring its new leader â€“ Big Chief Bagoomba.
