'''Caiman katanga''' were a water-dwelling species of [[katanga]] found in the rivers and lakes of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/Malatra Monstrous Compendium Sheets|21-22}}

==Description==
Katanga were intelligent animal [[shapechanger]]s who could take on the shape of a beast as well as appear in a hybrid form. In humanoid form, caiman katanga retained thick and leathery skin with a texture similar to that of a mundane [[caiman]]. Additionally, even in their Nubari form, caiman katanga showed small stubby {{SI|3'|'"|long=yes}} tails at the base of their lower backs. In their animal form they greatly resembles [[crocodile]]s.

One notable feature of all katanga, regardless of the form they took, was that the shadow they cast was always that of the animal.

==Abilities==
Not surprisingly, caiman katanga were great swimmers and hunters who relied on their predatorial instinct.

Despite similarities with werebeasts, katanga were not [[lycanthrope]]s and did not share their strengths or vulnerabilities. All katanga appeared to be ordinary natural animals when detected or examined via magic. In their animal form, caiman katanga could only communicate with others of their kin and rendered themselves unable to use magic.

Katanga could change their shape a limited number of times per day, depending on their experience and strength.

==Combat==
In battle, they used the benefits of each of their forms. Their strong jaws landed deadly bites, and strong tails were used to stun their opponents with. Their tough hides offered great resistance to damage and resilience. Most caimans were trained and wielded [[halfspear]]s.

==Personality==
Caiman katanga's stereotypical personality trait was selfishness. Most of these creatures showed self-centeredness and cared only about protecting their territory from all other intelligent creatures. Those caimans who ventured into adventuring lives often showed tolerance of other cultures and empathy to their allies, despite still being quite aggressive and fierce creatures.

==Society==
Most caiman katanga encountered in the wild were individual hunters. They were territorial beings who lived relying on hunter's instinct, denouncing civilization and the [[Nubari]] cultures. Caimans often stayed in the animal form, coming together into larger groups twice a year to mate. The mating rituals took place in spring and autumn. After the females laid eggs, katanga returned to their homes.

Despite their solitude, some caiman katanga sought out the lives of adventuring, leaving their homes and communities for the Nubari villages, where they joined adventuring groups. Most commonly, such individuals took on the roles of [[warrior]]s and hunters.

Caiman katanga spoke their own [[Caiman language]] that resembled grunts and growls of the caiman beast. Those who ventured into the wider Living Jungle learned [[Malatran common]] language.

They showed little interest in religion or spirituality. Those individuals who did often venerated Malatran nature spirits.

===Habitats===
These predators could be found in virtually any river or lake on the [[Malatran Plateau]]. 

Friendly caiman katanga who dwelt in the waters of the [[Sleepy Lake]], to the southwest of the [[Fire Mountain]], were believed to protect the peaceful Nubari [[Zantira]] tribes that made homes atop lake rafts. Some Zantirans believed that the lake's caiman katanga saved the water spirit protector [[Jung'r'na]], who instructed the shapeshifters to protect the Raft Dweller humans.{{Cite polyhedron/113/Raft Dwellers: The Zantiri Tribe|6-7}}

Vile bands of the caiman katanga were known to occasionally raid peaceful [[Koshiva]] tribes of the Living Jungle.{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|10}} River [[tam'hi]] harbored a distrust of caiman katanga as they often enough consumed the tam'hi young.

==History==
Some 20 years before the Year of Awakening, Malatran Calendar (late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]), the chieftain of then [[Saiyama]] tribe, [[Toloka]], was killed alongside his family by a band of malicious caiman katanga. Toloka's death led to the tribe's renaming honoring its new leader â€“ [[Big Chief Bagoomba]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|9}}

==Notable Caiman Katanga==
*[[Tog]], once an adventuring companion of [[witch doctor]] [[Bengoukee]], aged and retired in the Sleepy Lake by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Web of Destruction|7}}
