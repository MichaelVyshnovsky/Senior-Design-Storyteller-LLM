An allosaurus (|audio=allosaurus.ogg), also known as antrodemus, and referred to as flesh lizard by the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau, was a large species of carnivorous dinosaur, part of the carnosaur family, which, in turn, was a part of the larger saurischian family.
Allosaurs were large, fast and powerful hunters with strong hind-limbs and three-fingered forelimbs. All of the appendages ended in sharp claws. Allosaurss maws were filled with sharp serrated teeth.
Some of the most vicious hunters amongst dinosaurs, they were known for their great strength and running speed across any, even some of the most difficult terrains. An allosaurus could easily run down prey on open ground. Once it caught a creature it would use its claws to pounce it and pin it down.
Typically, allosaurs was a solitary beast. Their main prey were not just freshly killed brontosaurus and diplodocus but also carrion.
One of the colleges of the Tabaxi city of Mezro was known to ask explorers to hunt and capture a live allosaurus in exchange for jungle training or teaching the Tabaxi language. Magically-inclined individuals could summon an allosaurus to their aid with the Summon natures ally VI.
Allosaurs were commonly found in the jungles of Chult, across the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur, and in the Stonelands of Cormyr.
Beyond the Prime Material plane, some could be found in the Forbidden Plateau.
