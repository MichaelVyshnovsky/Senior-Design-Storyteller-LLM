'''Gray coaster''' is a species of seabirds that inhabited the [[Cimarine Isles|Cimarine]] and the [[Crab Reach]] islands off the coast west of [[Candlekeep]].

==Description==
Gray coasters were large grey avians with white underbellies. An average bird's wingspan reached {{SI|8'|'"|long=yes}}. They resembled a mix of a [[pelican]], a [[cormorant]], and an [[albatross]]. Gray coasters were known for being fat and stupid creatures.

==Ecology==
Gray coasters' were edible, but their flesh was unpleasantly oily.

Colonies of these dimwitted birds could be found on the southern shores of [[Sklorn]] – the easternmost island of the Crab Reach.
