        "mainbody": "'''Lurkers''', otherwise known as '''lurkers above''', were a type of [[aberration]] found in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "Lurkers physically resembled [[manta ray]]s but were much larger. Their underside was grey and had a texture similar to that of stone.",
        "Behavior": "Lurkers tended to stubbornly fight others to the point of death.",
        "Biology": "Lurkers flew due to a gas they naturally generated in internal sacs. This gas gave them a natural buoyancy, which they coasted upon by flapping their wing-like mass.",
        "Abilities": "Lurkers were nearly impossible to detect, thanks to their excellent camouflage.",
        "Combat": "Lurkers hunted by hiding along the top of caverns and tunnels, attaching themselves with their camouflaged underside facing downwards. Once a target passes underneath, it dropped from the ceiling, slamming into them and wrapping itself around its prey. It killed its prey by constriction.",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], lurkers could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Lurkers were an omnivorous species and ate whatever they could manage.",
            "Usage": "Lurkers were sought after to be trained and employed as defensive creatures. As such, lurker eggs could be sold for up to 900 [[gp]] and a newborn lurker up to 1,100 [[gp]]. The gas generated by lurkers could be used as a [[material component]] in the brewing of a ''[[potion of levitation]]''."
