A '''wight''' was an [[undead]] creature given a semblance of life through sheer violence and hatred. They could drain the life energy out of victims by touch, turning them into new wights upon death.

{{quote|''Just one look in its eyes, and you know a wight is not a man. It hates the living. It hates us and everything we have. All the beast wants is our souls and our blood.''|Garibanz of Harkenwold{{Cite dungeon/191/Bestiary: Wights|2}}}}

==Description==
Wights appeared as weird and twisted reflections of the forms they had in life. Their mummified flesh covered the twisted skeleton, the hands ended up in deadly claws, and teeth were sharp and jagged like needles. Wights spoke in wheezes, gasps, and moans.

A wight's eyes were calcified and useless for vision&mdash;in fact, what little light could penetrate a wight's eyes was painful to it&mdash;however they were still able to perceive life energy. When attacking their prey, wights' eyes glowed like white-hot embers.

Most wights were [[humanoid]].{{Cite dragon/348/Ecology of the Wight|61}}

==Personality==
Wights were evil undead creatures brought back to unlife by their vanity, evil deeds, and desires. Upon the ends of their mortal lives, the dying spirits reached out to [[Orcus]] or another evil deity, receiving undeath in exchange for spending eternity, hating and trying to destroy all living beings.

Wights retained their personalities and memories in their undeath. While they possessed free will, they were also bound to perform the bidding of the evil powers that brought them back{{Cite dragon/348/Ecology of the Wight|62}}

Wights were territorial creatures. They rarely traveled away from their burial places, or locations they knew in life unless commanded by their masters, although some exceptions to these rules indeed existed. Scholars theorized that wights' attachment to their tombs was due to its reminder of their condition, which was more of a source of pride rather than sorrow. Another theory was they dwelled in catacombs simply due to the tactical benefits of winding corridors and shadows. Regardless, a wight would quickly come to learn the layout of their catacombs in exacting detail.

As a byproduct of their ability to "see" life energy, wights could also "see" an aura of the psychic value that living beings placed onto their valuables. This led to a behavior in which wights would collect such valuables seemingly for the aesthetic value of these auras. Because they did not take care to preserve the physical objects, anything that was not both durable and non-rusting tended to deteriorate in a wight's possession, which could leave them carrying small troves of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[gem]]s.

==Combat==
[[File:Wight_AFR.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A wight draining the life from its victim]]
Upon touching someone living, wights drained the life out of the victim, even through their flesh, clothing, and armor. They preferred to move stealthily or hide in the shadows before springing surprise attacks on unsuspecting victims.

Wights were sometimes known to serve other stronger undead creatures like [[wraith]]s and other evil beings. When they followed a leader, they often avoided strategy and planning, relying on their drive for death and destruction instead.

A slaughter wight was able to release a ''death wail'' when slain. That ability whipped surrounding undead creatures into a frenzied attack.

Like other undead, wights were resistant to harmful [[necromantic]] energies and to wounds dealt by non-[[magic]]al or non-[[silver]]ed weapons. They were likewise immune to [[poison]]s and were unaffected by ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[charm]]'', ''[[Hold monster|hold]]'' (or similar) spells. ''[[Holy water]]'' was deadly to them, and the ''[[raise dead]]'' spell was said to instantly annihilate a wight.

==Variants==
;Aquatic wight: Also known as sea wights,{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|8}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Night at Sharkey's Bar and Grill|8}}

==Ecology==
Wights were active at night, retreating away from the hated sunlight into crypts, tombs, burial mounds, where they dwelt during the day. Unlike [[vampires]] though, wights simply disliked the sun, not harmed by it.{{Cite dragon/348/Ecology of the Wight|63}}

Wights were deathly silent in their movements and very good at camouflaging with the dreary walls of the tombs in which they dwelt, which allowed them to attack from hiding. Less experienced [[adventurer]]s were known to panic when this happened, believing that the stealthy monsters were instead "emerging from the walls".

Like other undead, wights did not need air, food, drink, or sleep. Due to their particular undead nature, wights existed simultaneously on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] as well as on the [[Negative Material Plane|Negative Material]] planes, which granted them their powerful life-draining abilities. A lot of animals could feel the presence of these evil dead creatures: [[dog|dogs]] growled and howled, [[horse]]s stopped and refused to move forward feeling the creatures, birds, and insects fell silent. 

===Life Draining===
Even though wights hungered for living beings' energy, they did not require it as a source of sustenance, although some scholars speculated that it was used to help them animate their undead bodies. Regardless, wights could retain their undeath while trapped in tombs for centuries, staying completely motionless until a living being entered their lair. Some sages theorized that when a wight drained a victim's life energy, it received a rush of mortality, euphoric reminder of their mortal existence, and that chasing that feeling led to extremely depraved actions by wights. Other sages believed that the life energy allowed the wight to mature in strength and willpower, allowing it to gain some control over its urges. Wights that absorbed enough life energy could take command over lesser wights, and were called [[great wight]]s.

[[File:Wight 2e.png|thumb|223x223px|''A wight lurking in the darkness.'']]Humanoid victims of a wight's life draining powers were reanimated as [[zombies]]&mdash;sometimes called "half-wights"&mdash;controlled by their killer. In some cases, creatures that were killed with the life-draining attacks came back as enslaved wights themselves. If the master was slain, the wights that were created regained their malicious free will. Bringing a wight back to life was nearly impossible.

==History==
The word "wight" meant "person" in the Realms' past.{{Cite dragon/348/Ecology of the Wight|60}}

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], one of the foremost experts on wights in [[Faerûn]] was [[Jilda the Sage]], however her writings on the subject were often flawed due to both her lack of any adventuring experience and her social biases as a daughter of royalty. Some of the faulty claims which she promulgated included the idea that wights were exclusively noble-born men and women whose bodies were possessed by evil [[spirit]]s, that they were prolific burrowers, and that they could only communicate with each other by communing their spirits at close range. She and other scholars at the time also claimed that it was unheard of for wights to use weapons instead of their own claws.<ref>

The ancient barrow burial locations where wights could be often found could be found all over North-Western Faerun, namely the [[Moonshae Islands]], [[Dalelands]], and [[Rashemen]]. [[Battle of Bones|The Battle of Bones]] spawned a plethora of wights and undead over the years as well.{{Cite dragon/348/Ecology of the Wight|64}} In [[1357 DR]] wights could be found infesting the Burial Glen in [[Myth Drannor]] along with other undead creatures. 

As of [[1371 DR]] a group of ten undead [[Purple Dragons]] wights roamed the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] in Cormyr looking for the “enemies of Cormyr". In their twisted undead state, of course, the enemies were all living beings.

==Notable Wights==
* [[Na (wight)]] was a raised shell of a "resurrection agent" only knows as [[Harlot]] in [[1463 DR]].
* [[Akar Kessell]] was a mage in [[Icewind Dale]] who attempted to conquer the region using ''[[Crenshinibon]]''. He returned as a wight in [[1485 DR]] attempting to poison the region with ''[[Black ice]]''.
* [[Hedrun Arnsfirth]] was the chosen of [[Auril]] that was turned into a wight after her defeat, and consequential imprisonment by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] in 1485 DR.
