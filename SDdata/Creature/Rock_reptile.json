        "mainbody": "A rock reptile was a rare being that resembled a large, rocky, reptilian creature.\nRock reptiles drew on many characteristics of other known reptiles. As such, they looked similar to huge rocky lizards, but also had chameleon-like abilities, such as shifting their skin color to suit their surroundings. Thus, these creatures were incredibly hard to spot in rocky terrain.\nSuch creatures were around the size of a human, but could grow up to twice that size.\nRock reptiles used their large bodies to attack foes, initially running into them at high speeds. As they preferred to attack at night, where they could blend into their rocky environment, their opponents were often surprised and thrown off guard.\nThese reptiles much preferred to find prey at night, but would hunt outside if they were desperate for food. After a successful hunt, rock reptiles dragged sometimes dragged their victims and their belongings back to their rocky abodes.\nRock reptiles were known to dwell across the Savage Frontier and in the mid-level caverns of Deepearth."
