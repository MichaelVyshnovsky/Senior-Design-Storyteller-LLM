Barracudas were a type of carnivorous fish that inhabited warm salt water.
Barracudas typically did not attack humanoid creatures. However, they occasionally would attack humanoids carrying shiny objects, out of a mistaken belief that said object was a small fish they could prey upon.
Barracudas were lightning-quick predators, attacking any prey that was injured or appeared helpless. Occasionally they would use their speed to launch themselves out of the water and bite at creatures on a boat.
On the continent of Faer√ªn, barracudas could be found in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Beyond that continent, they could be found in bodies of salt water in Zakhara.
Outside of the Prime Material plane, barracudas could be found in the domain of Draga Salt-Biter in the Domains of Dread.
Some sea mages were known to keep barracudas as familiars.
* Those who specialized in sea-based magic could summon a barracuda with the spells monster summoning I, monster summoning II, and monster summoning III.
