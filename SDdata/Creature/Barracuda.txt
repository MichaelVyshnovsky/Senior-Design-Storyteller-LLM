'''Barracudas''' were a type of carnivorous fish that inhabited warm salt water.

==Behavior==
Barracudas typically did not attack [[humanoid]] creatures. However, they occasionally would attack humanoids carrying shiny objects, out of a mistaken belief that said object was a small fish they could prey upon.{{Cite dragon/200/Familiar Faces|33}}

==Combat==
Barracudas were lightning-quick predators, attacking any prey that was injured or appeared helpless. Occasionally they would use their speed to launch themselves out of the water and bite at creatures on a boat.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
On the continent of [[Faer√ªn]], barracudas could be found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].<ref> Beyond that continent, they could be found in bodies of salt water in [[Zakhara]].<ref>

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], barracudas could be found in the domain of [[Draga Salt-Biter]] in the [[Domains of Dread]].

===Relationships===
Some [[sea mage]]s were known to keep barracudas as [[familiar]]s.

==Trivia==
* Those who specialized in sea-based [[magic]] could [[summon]] a barracuda with the [[spell]]s ''[[monster summoning I]]'', ''[[monster summoning II]]'', and ''[[monster summoning III]]''.{{Cite dragon/220/Arcane Lore: Sea Magic|72}}
