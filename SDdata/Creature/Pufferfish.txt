'''Pufferfish''', also known as '''blowfish''', were a species of [[fish]] found in the Realms.{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|7}}{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Myth Nantar|9}}

==Description==
These creatures were covered in spines,

==Species==
===Fugu===
Otherwise known as '''globefish''', were a species of pufferfish endemic to the waters around [[Kozakura]]. Its toxin was confined within its liver. The fish was long considered a delicacy in the island nation &mdash; in ancient times they developed techniques to prepare fugu so that only a small amount of its toxin remained, making an eater's mouth slightly numb, but these were a closely guarded secret.

===Giant Puffer===
[[File:Neverwinter - giant puffer.png|thumb|200px|''Giant puffer.'']]
An uncommon species of overly large pufferfish that was endemic to [[Chult]]. They were easily identified by their elaborate patterns. Despite their size, their toxin was no more potent than the average pufferfish. Fishers could catch them usually by accident while using [[leatherjacket]]s as bait, and owing to their size and toxicity, they were usually thrown back.

===Striped Puffer===
[[File:Neverwinter - striped puffer.png|thumb|200px|''Striped puffer.'']]
An uncommon species of pufferfish endemic to the lakes and weed beds of Chult. They could inflate themselves to a greater extent than the average pufferfish. They fed primarily upon [[snail]]s and leatherjackets, and were sometimes used in the preparation of [[poison]]s.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
The diet of these fish included [[coral]] and shellfish.<ref>

===Habitats===
These creatures could be found in the [[Chultan Peninsula]], in the waters around Kozakura, in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], and [[Akanamere]].

===Usages===
[[Merfolk]] were known to fashion pufferfish quills into [[bolt]]s. The [[Poisoned Quill]], a tribe of them in the Sea of Fallen, carried around pouches full of quills.

[[Blowfish casserole]] was a dangerous dish from the city-state of [[Sumbria]] of the [[Blade Kingdoms]]. 

==History==
Throughout the history of Kozakura, many people died each year from eating fugu prepared by chefs untrained in the necessary techniques. The founder of the [[Akimatsu family|Akimatsu dynasty]], the semi-legendary [[Akimatsu Mori]], was one such person who nearly died from improperly prepared fugu while dining at [[Nami No Hana]]. An apprentice chef at the inn, [[Sumitomo Tomy]], noticed something wrong with the dish and managed to intervene before Mori could consume it.
