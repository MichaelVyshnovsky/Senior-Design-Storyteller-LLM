        "mainbody": "'''Spirit nagas''' were the most powerful type of [[naga]] and were akin to [[witch]]es among other naga races.\n{{quote|''What have we here? Something more to eat? I like it when they fight, It makes the meat that much sweeter.''|A spirit naga to its prey.}}",
        "Description": "They had a [[human]] female head on a snake body. Spirit nagas had serpentine bodies with black scales and red bands. Their humanoid faces were framed with stringy hair.\n\nThe spirit nagas emitted stench of carrion, making them look as foul as they smell. Which was very appropriate, for their favorite meal was rotting flesh.\n\nSome, if not all, spirit nagas possessed the ability to shapeshift into a human or [[demihuman]] form. However, they disliked [[humanoid]] forms, preferring the advantage of a tail.",
        "Biology": "Spirit nagas' blood was quite [[acid]]ic and, when spilled, emitted a hissing, sizzling sound, the telltale sign of its corrosive quality.",
        "Personality": "They were even more mysterious and enigmatic than the others of their kind, seeking lost [[magic]] to a fanatical extent. They saw only evil, ugliness, and they delighted in causing suffering and death with the powers they possessed.",
        "Combat": "Spirit nagas were powerful spellcasters. The bite of a spirit naga was deadly, as it contained venom. The eyes of the creature were no better, as their gaze could cause others to fall under the control of the naga. These nagas came back to life just a few days after their death, making them virtually immortal, this ability could only be stopped via a ''[[wish]]'' spell.\n\nSpirit nagas were cunning creatures, preferring spells and [[trap]]s, and often attacking without warning.",
        "Society": "Spirit nagas preferred solitude or ruling over lower creatures, being worshiped in cults.\n\nIn [[Chult]], spirit nagas often took on the role of chieftain over [[pterafolk]] tribes.\n\nMost nagas respected culture and lore and considered it to be a worthy goal to preserve it, leading them to claim homes in ruins of ancient civilizations long gone. Even vile and evil spirit nagas that loved destruction established lairs in lost cities, temples, or castles (sometimes that they themselves brought to ruin).\n\n[[Ha-naga|Ha-nagas]] were massive and powerful naga lords and often worshiped by spirit nagas as gods.",
        "History": "Nagas were created via magical inbreeding by the [[sarrukh]] early on in the era of [[Mhairshaulk]]. By [[-24000 DR|–24000 DR]], Mhairshaulk has been in decline and the nagas have almost completely abandoned their homeland spreading all around Faerûn.\n\nIn the following millennia, nagas naturally branched and evolved into numerous naga species, including spirit nagas.\n\nSome spirit nagas unearthed ancient rituals of their creators transforming themselves into powerful being called [[ha-naga|ha-nagas]].\n\nIn [[1372 DR]] spirit nagas were a recent addition to the city of Najara. A dozen spirit nagas served the King of Najara as protectors of the royal line.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], a foul spirit naga was encountered in one of the frozen caverns up in the [[Sunrise Mountains]].",
        "Notable Spirit Nagas": "*[[Asp (spirit naga)|Asp]] was the personal assistant of [[Maligor]], the [[Zulkir]] of [[Transmutation]]. Her appearance diverged from that of the usual spirit naga, appearing as a human woman from the waist up, with a snake's tail in place of legs, though this may have been a magical disguise. Maligor used Asp's ability to shapeshift to replace the manager of [[Thay]]'s [[gold]] mines, thereby taking control of them. This was all part of a complicated plot with the purpose of getting rid of the zulkir of [[necromancy]], his most powerful adversary.\n*First Consort [[Ssibalentanamas]] was the spirit naga priest of [[Sseth]] in charge of the [[yuan-ti]] breeding program that took place in the catacombs beneath the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]] in [[1372 DR]].\n*[[Ithkyxan]] was one of the spirit nagas serving King [[Ebarnaje]] in [[1372 DR]], as well as a guardian of portals linking [[Serpent Hills]] with the [[Slitherswamp]] level of [[Undermountain]].\n*[[Ssensariith]] a spirit naga who in [[1359 DR]] established a lair in [[Adderposts]], [[Essembra]] and led [[Duskar Flamehaern]] to believe it was the divine incarnation of Sss’thasine’ss, helping him to expand his drug and slave trades.\n*[[Ihanvas]] was a spirit naga in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]]."
