The crier turned out to be one of a pair of keches. While I cannot urge that cries for help be ignored, travelers must use the utmost caution when these creatures are known to be about an area.''|An exerpt from a lecture by sage Oparin of [[Oerth]].}}",
        "Description": "Keches were monkey-like [[humanoids]] that had lean, muscular, and wiry bodies. They were covered in leathery skin with green protrusions that looked like tree leaves. Like other monkeys, they had arms longer than their legs and prehensile tails, allowing them to move with lightning speed across the canopies. They also had elongated prehensile toes that allowed them sturdier grasps and easy swinging. A kech's face was reminiscent of a human's but with protruding jaws that housed large fangs, and malicious eyes of blue or sometimes red color. The individuals with red eyes generally did not have visible pupils. Compared to those of humans, a kech's nose was diminutive, and the green-leafed skin hid their ears. Unlike other mammals, keches' bodies were almost completely hairless.\n\nTheir physique made keches comfortable in the trees and on the ground. When they ran through the forest beds, they did so like [[baboon]]s, making springy movements using their knuckles and back legs.\n\nKeches' sexual dimorphism was minimal, with the only difference between sexes being their bulk. Adult males usually reached {{SIrange|5|6|ft|long=yes}} tall and {{SIrange|120|150|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight, while females were around {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SI|100|lb|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "[[File:Kech ecology.jpg|thumb|300px|''A kech hanging off a tree branch and eyeing its next meal.'']]\nIt seemed that keches' main drive was luring unwitting [[human]]s to their dooms in the deepest forests, ensnaring them in [[trap]]s, and consuming their flesh. Keches lived in thick forests and thrived in any climate. However, these were not mindless beasts. They were capable of setting pitfall traps, [[snare]]s, and deadfalls. Some kech groups were even known to organize raids on humanoids living in or close to forests. These fiends captured and fled with their living prey only to devour them later in the privacy of deep woodlands. Possibly the most devious of keches' traps was their ability to imitate screams of distress and pleas for help that often lured prey to become a bloody feast.\n\nKeches were intelligent enough to have developed their own [[Kech language|language]], speak clear [[Common]], and have a passing knowledge of local languages spoken within their hunting territory. The kech language sounded like [[squirrel]] chatter and whistles. However, scholars largely failed to translate their tongue apart from a couple of words. Other languages were used to fake cries for help and lure travelers into traps and ambushes. Their camouflage and knowledge of the woods made it hard to track keches even by an experienced [[ranger]]. Keches were not known to use tools apart from utilizing traps.\n\nThese monkey-like humanoids enjoyed terrorizing villages and torturing their living prey before devouring them. Bigger groups of keches were known to rampage through villages in the darkest moonless nights, leaving none alive. However, there was a very small chance of encountering a neutral-aligned group of keches in the wild.",
        "Combat": "Keches used trapmaking and cunning as their main weapons and their powerful camouflage as their main defense. When forced into direct confrontation, they attacked with claw rends and bites. The most common battle tactics for them were ambushing prey, picking and attacking one or two targets, trying to slay them as quickly as possible, and then retreating with the corpses into the woods.\n\nKeches preferred to attack lone targets but did not shy away from attacking a group of well-armored adventurers at night, trying to ambush and quickly slay creatures standing guard.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Keches were known to hunt in the deepest and darkest parts of the [[High Forest]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], along with other rarely seen creatures such as [[forlarren]], [[peryton]]s, and [[mongrel men]].\n\nIn the lands of [[Kara-Tur]], keches could be found stalking towns on the edges of tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate forests.",
            "Usages": "If captured alive, kech young could be sold for around 550 [[gold piece]]s.{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|19}}\n\nKech skin was valued for its thickness and durability. It was hard to work with, but if tanned skillfully, it could be crafted into exceptional [[leather armor]]."
        },
        "Rumors and Legends": "Some sages theorized that keches were descendants of early humans that adapted to living and hunting in thick forests. Keches felt special hatred towards humans, which was another topic of scholarly speculation. Some claimed that it was due to humans mistreating and abusing forests, while others said that the attitude was born out of some ancient feud."
