'''Baphitaurs''' were monstrous [[planetouched]] creatures that lived in the [[Labyrinth]] in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
Baphitaurs were tall, broad creatures, about {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall.<ref group="note">The source says about the same size and build as an [[orc]] warrior. They most closely resembled [[minotaur]]s, with a bestial head and bull ears, as well as short, very sharp horns. Their bodies were covered in stringy hair and they possessed a long tail. Their feet were those of humanoids rather than hooves.

==Abilities==
Like their minotaur relatives, baphitaurs had an innate sense of direction and understanding of mazes, and could not get lost while in one. Additionally, their demon blood provided resistance to cold, electricity, and fire. Baphitaurs possessed a keen sense of smell. Once each day, a baphitaur could create ''[[darkness]]''. Additionally, all baphitaurs were capable of raging like a barbarian.

==Society==
Baphitaurs were a nasty, brutish people of similar mindset as their demonic ancestors. Most baphitaurs trained as [[barbarian]]s; however, [[cleric]]s were also known. Baphitaurs worshiped the [[demon lord]] [[Baphomet]].

==History==
Baphitaurs were the product of ancient [[Netherese]] experiments that combined [[human]], minotaur, and [[demon]] blood (namely [[ghour]] and [[goristro]] demons{{Cite dragon/350/Legacies of Ancient Empires: Planetouched of Faer√ªn|50}}) through awful sorcery. They were initially created at the school of magic at [[Andalbruin]], but escaped centuries before [[Netheril]] fell to dwell in the [[Labyrinth]]. There they would come to dwell for many centuries, improving upon its original [[dwarf|dwarven]] design{{Cite web/Races of the Northern Underdark}}

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the baphitaurs started becoming increasingly active. They extended their reach to the Underdark paths around the Labyrinth and their devotion to baphomet reached a frenzied pitch.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Shadow Path: Labyrinth}}
