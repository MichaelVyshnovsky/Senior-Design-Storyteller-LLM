        "mainbody": "Archelon ischyras (), also known as archelon, was a species of large marine turtle. Archelons were technically not dinosaurs.\nArchelons were large turtles, with a massive shell. Their shell was a leathery shell instead of a hard shell. It was thick and formed in plates. Archelons had a pair of large, powerful flippers. \nTheir thick and strong shell provided archelons with amble defence against predators.\nArchelons were found in oceans, spending most of their time in the water. \nArchelons were carnivores and were solitary creatures."
