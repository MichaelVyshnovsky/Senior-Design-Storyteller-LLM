Warthogs were a species of pig-like omnivores related to boars.
Warthogs had large tusks that they used to defend themselves. They measured  tall at the shoulder.
Warthogs were aggressive creatures that often fought to the death, though only were aggressive when threatened or cornered or if their territory was threatened.
Warthogs were near exclusively found in warm climates.
On the continent of Faerûn, warthogs could be found in the Midwood and Starwood reaches of the Cormanthor forest, in the Calim Desert, in the Plain of Standing Stones, and in the Wyllowwood of Undermountain.
Beyond Faerûn they could be found on the continent of Zakhara, inhabiting badlands, forests, and hills. There they were commonly hunted by jungle giants.
Beyond the Prime Material, in the plane of Qui, a field in sector five of the plane was populated with a herd of warthogs during the Season of the Unicorn.
