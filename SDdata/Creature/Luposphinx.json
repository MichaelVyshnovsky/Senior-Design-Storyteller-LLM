        "Description": "Luposphinxes were, like other sphinxes, largely leonine in form, about {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} in length, with feathered wings. Their wolvish heads set them apart from other sphinxes. The fur ranged from dark brown to light grey in color.",
        "Personality": "Luposphinxes were very intelligent but evil creatures that acted according to their desires.",
        "Abilities": "Twice each day, luposphinxes could emit a frightful howl that could deafen and even panic creatures within {{SI|60|ft}} of them.",
        "Combat": "When a luposphinx got into a fight, they preferred to start with a howl, followed by melee attacks with their front claws and powerful jaws.",
        "Ecology": "Luposphinxes lived in forested areas. They were generally solitary, although some were known to be served by [[xvart]]s or [[gnoll]]s. They were also carnivorous and were known to prey on humanoids; luposphinxes preferred the flesh of [[elf|elves]] and [[halfling]]s."
