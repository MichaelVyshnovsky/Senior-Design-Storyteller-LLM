}}'''Segarrans''' were [[humanoid]]â€“animal hybrid servants of the [[Zakharan pantheon|savage goddess]] [[Ragarra]] that could be found in the jungles of [[east Zakhara]]. They were created through [[Divine magic|priestly spells]] and came in two distinct sub-species.

==Lesser Segarrans==
{{Main|Lesser segarran}}With humanoid body and the tail and head of a [[crocodile]], lesser segarrans spread violence and fear in the name of their goddess.

==Greater Segarrans==
{{Main|Greater segarran}}Created from powerful priestesses of Ragarra, greater segarrans could appear either as [[human]]s, retaining much of their spellcasting ablities, or transform into a terrible and enormous reptilian creature, sometimes with bat wings.

==Trivia==
The great bay adjacent to Zakhara's greatest expanse of forest, the [[Sempadan Forest|Jungle of Monsters]], was called the [[Segara Sea]] (though not in [[Midani]]).<ref><ref> It is unclear if the similarity of the name to the segarrans was accidental.
