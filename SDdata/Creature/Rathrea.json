        "mainbody": "The rathrea were dragons transformed by a secret ritual performed in Skelkor in Laerakond. Dragonborn called them ghost dragons.Not to be confused with ghost dragons.\nRathrea were created when dragons failed to awaken after having consumed arambar. Those dragons eventually transformed into wraith-like, incorporeal glowing white spirits who had the ability to divine the future. This ability was limited to certain areas of information and timespans.\nThe rathrea didnt live for much time, fading away in a few weeks. According to Gauwervyndhal, those rathrea \"ascended\" after they disappeared.\nThe Empress Dragon Gauwervyndhal forced many of her dragon servants, even her own children, to consume arambar in order to commune with the dead primordial Arambar to obtain lost knowledge."
