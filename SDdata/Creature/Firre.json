        "Description": "Firre eladrin appeared similar to stocky [[elves]] and had bright red hair and fiery red eyes that lacked both pupil and iris. Most stood about {{SI|6|feet|c|long=yes}} tall and weighed about {{SI|150|pounds|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "Firres were guardians of beauty in all of its artistic forms, having a burning passion for it. Their favorite pastimes included singing and dancing around campfires, but they also traveled all over to observe the greatest artisans at work or take in a scene of natural beauty. They lived their own lives as much as possible as expressions of art, seeking to take in as much wonder and delight as possible. They sometimes, while in disguise, served to inspire other mortal artists.\n\nFirres were known to sometimes form passionate relationships with mortals from the Material Plane.\n\nThey could come across as frivolous at times, but, like all eladrin, firres were always willing to fight against evil, especially against those who would mar beauty. No firre would ever harm either a work of art or an artist—even if that artist were evil, at least not directly.\n\nIntellectually, most firres would be considered geniuses. They were almost always of a mindset of [[chaotic good]]ness and were never rigidly lawful or evil.",
        "Abilities": "Firres moved very quickly on their feet and were exceptionally strong. By some accounts, they could [[Darkvision|see in the dark]] and in [[Low-light vision|dim light]].\n[[File:Two Celestials.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''A firre and a [[leonal]] [[guardinal]].'']]\nFirres were surrounded at all times by a powerful aura that [[Magic circle against evil|protected them and nearby allies from evil]]. All eladrin were immune to electrical and petrifying dangers and resistant against the effects of cold and acid, and firres shared these qualities. They were resistant to spells and attacks from mundane weapons but were weak to weapons forged from [[cold iron]], as were many [[fey]] creatures.\n\nFirres could call on the power of [[divine magic]] and also had access to a wide assortment of innate magical powers, including the ability to create an [[advanced illusion]], to [[control flames]], to create a source of [[continual light]], to [[detect thoughts]], to throw [[Fireball|balls of fire]], to [[Greater invisibility|turn invisible]], to [[polymorph]], to [[see invisibility]], and to create a [[wall of fire]]. Daily, they could muster the power to create a [[prismatic spray]].\n\nWhen in humanoid form, the gaze of an angry firre could cause and opponent to burst into flame and go blind.\n\nLike all eladrin, firres could assume an incorporeal form. At will, they could transform into an {{SIAdj|8|foot|c|adj=tall}} pillar or ball of flame. In this form, a firre could fly at more than double its normal speed. A firre could not change into a pillar of fire if submerged in water or in heavy rainfall, nor could they assume such a form while wearing armor.\n\nFirres were renowned for their beautiful singing voices and were sought the [[Cosmology|planes]] over as performers. Their songs had all the powers of [[bard]]ic magic.\n\nFirre eladrin could use their innate magic to [[Tongues|speak in any language]], but their native languages were [[Celestial language|Celestial]] and Eladrin. Many learned [[Common]], [[Infernal language|Infernal]] and [[Draconic language|Draconic]] as well.",
        "Combat": "Most firres preferred to fight with some variety of enchanted swords, often [[greatsword]]s, and they often chose ones with wavy blades. For ranged weapons, they favored magic [[javelin]]s, which turned into fiery bolts when thrown, and usually carried up to four. They appreciated the artwork of finely crafted weapons.\n\nWhen in disguise on the Material Plane, they often wore armor, but otherwise did not, as it hindered their ability to change forms.\n\nFirres saw finesse in battle as a form of art. Tactically, they began most battles by using their wide arrange of spells, songs, and magic abilities to disrupt the enemies forces. When finally entering into combat themselves, they moved into position as columns of fire, before taking humanoid form and attacking with their fiery gazes and weapons. They prioritized defending the innocent and any items of beauty before focusing on victory over their foes.",
        "Society": "Firres lived in the plane of [[Arborea]],\n\nFirres rarely lived or worked in groups, preferring their individuality, and more than a pair were never found in any one [[tulani]]'s court.\n\nLike all eladrin, firres were not supposed to reveal their true natures to inhabitants of the Prime.",
        "Ecology": "Firres were not truly immortal, yet their lifespans were long. A typical firre could live for over 500 years.",
        "History": "Firres were known to participate in some of the wild summer solstice revelries held by the temples of [[Hanali Celanil]]. At such events, in places such as [[Myth Drannor]], [[Evermeet]], and [[Evereska]], [[sun elves]] frequently coupled with firres and produced [[planetouched]] offspring known as [[celadrin]]. Celadrin were particularly common in [[Deepingdale]] and around [[Lake Sember]].{{Cite dragon/350/Legacies of Ancient Empires: Planetouched of Faerûn|52-53}}\n\n[[Morwel]], the queen of all eladrin, was allied to a powerful [[brass dragon]] named [[Ronothere]]. Through him, she lent military aid to the cause of the [[archomental]] [[Zaaman Rul]] in his resistance against [[Imix]], and this aid included a squad of firres.{{Cite dragon/353/Princes of Elemental Good|50}}\n\nThe goddess [[Lliira]] particularly favored them as divine servants."
