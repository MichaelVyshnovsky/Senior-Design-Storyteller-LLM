        "mainbody": "'''Noctrals''' were a race of avian creatures native to the [[plane]] of [[Mount Celestia]].",
        "Description": "Noctrals largely resembled great horned [[owl]]s, but stood roughly as tall as a full-grown [[human]] and had a wingspan of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. Their plumage varied in color from [[dove]]-like gray to deep black. Their faces were heart-shaped, much like a barn owl, and they had large golden hue eyes with a protective inner eyelid.",
        "Personality": "Noctrals were extremely intelligent and peaceful creatures. They often delighted in showing off their intelligence and sharing their extensive knowledge with mortals, especially if those creatures were polite and patient. However, if it was clear that someone had evil intentions for knowledge they would never share it.",
        "Biology": "Much like mundane species of birds, noctrals had hollow bones. Their hearing was four times better than any [[elf]] and their eyes could see well in total darkness.\n\n[[File:Noctral-2.png|thumb|273px|A noctral stands perched next to a humanoid inhabitant of Mount Celestia.]]",
        "Abilities": "Noctrals possessed a number of abilities similar to the [[spell]]s ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[speak with animals]]'', and ''[[tongues]]''. They could also cast ''[[legend lore]]'' three times per day.\n\nIn addition, their race possessed a natural form of [[telepathy]] that allowed them to speak with most mortal creatures within a {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} radius and because of their high intellect they could effectively ''[[detect lie]]'' against humans and [[demihuman]]s when speaking telepathically with them.",
        "Combat": "These creatures tried to avoid combat whenever possible, though were physically more than a match against one or two minor [[fiend]]s. Much like an owl they fought in the air, using their sharp talons and hooked beaks. But unlike an owl, they never killed for sport or pleasure.\n\nWhen confronted with more powerful opponents, a noctral would retreat and seek the aid of their allies.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Despite being highly intelligent creatures, noctrals still hunted for prey at night like the mundane owl. When doing so they only targeted non-intelligent creatures.",
            "Relationships": "Noctrals were most often known to befriend [[archon]]s, [[aasimon]], and exceptional [[petitioner]]s. They spent much of their time providing their companions with the advice.\n\nThey were a [[favored monster]] of a variety of deities in the Realms and thus were under their protection. Harming such a noctral was liable to incur direct retribution from their patron. Alternatively, a power might send a [[deva]] or [[planetar]] to the noctral's aid.\n\nAmong the [[Morndinsamman]] they were known to act as servants of [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Gorm Gulthyn]], [[Moradin]]. In the [[Seldarine]] they were known to act as servants of [[Aerdrie Faenya]] and [[Corellon]]. Among the [[Lords of the Golden Hills]] they were known to act as servants of [[Gaerdal Ironhand]]. Among [[Yondalla's Children]] they were known to act as servants of [[Arvoreen]], [[Cyrrollalee]], and [[Yondalla]] herself."
