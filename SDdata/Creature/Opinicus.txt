}}'''Opinicus''' ({{Pronounce|o|PIN|i|kus|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) ({{SingPl}}) were strange good-hearted creatures found in the deserts and ruins of [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Description==
Opinicus appeared to be a blend of several animals. They possessed the body of a [[camel]] with the face of a [[monkey]]. They also had a [[lion]]'s mane and tail with [[eagle]] wings sprouting from their back. Their front paws had opposable thumbs, allowing them to grasp things like monkeys.

Most opinicus were light brown or golden in color, with darker faces and wings.

==Abilities==
These creatures were able to turn undead similar to a priest. Additionally, they possessed the following spell-like abilities: ''[[holy word]]'' and ''[[heal]]''. They could become ethereal at will.

The unique attack of an opinicus was a glowing gaze that created a cone of light that damaged any undead or creatures of the lower planes.

Opinicus possessed natural [[psionic]] talents. Though they usually used them for travelling and playing pranks, they could be used during combat as well. These powers included: ''[[probability travel]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[astral projection]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[dimension walk]]'', ''[[dream travel]]'', ''[[teleport trigger]]'', ''[[time/space anchor]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', ''[[animate objects]]'', ''[[control winds]]'', ''[[inertial barrier]]'', and ''[[levitate|levitation]]''.

==Combat==
Though they usually avoided combat, opinicus had a strong hatred of evil creatures, especially [[undead]] and [[al-jahar]], whom they attacked on sight. They would often come to the aid of a good cause.

Their sharp senses made it nearly impossible to surprise an opinicus. They were very stealthy creatures, allowing them to sneak up on others with ease.

During combat, an opinicus attempted to strike an opponent with its front paws, followed up by a rake with the rear claws.

==Ecology==
These creatures could live for centuries and did not have much of an influence on their habitat. They would sometimes clean the ruins they called home, or make sculptures to decorate them.
===Habitats===
Ancient ruins were the preferred home of an opinicus. When found elsewhere, they were usually on some kind of personal mission. They enjoyed playing harmless pranks on travelers.
===Relationships===
These creatures sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of [[Aerdrie Faenya]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Many sages believed that these creatures were initially summoned to battle [[vargouille]]s or Al-Jahar.
