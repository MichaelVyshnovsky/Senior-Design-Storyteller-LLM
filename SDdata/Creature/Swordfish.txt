'''Swordish''' were a peaceful species of predatory [[fish]], named for their flat pointed bills that resembled [[sword]]s.

==Combat==
Being non-aggressive creatures, swordfish typically fled from conflict unless provoked or trained to engage in combat. When they did fight, a swordfish would use their long sword-like bills.

==Ecology==
Medium-sized swordfish were often kept as pets or utilized as guards by other creatures, typically [[aquatic elf]]s and [[dolphin]] communities. The [[Lambent Eye]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] served swordfish encrusted in nuts, while [[Nimber's Skewer Shop]] offered grilled swordfish and [[mango]] [[skewer]]s.

Swordfish were also an occasional prey of [[spiretop dragon]]s. It took a small flock to kill a single swordfish.{{Cite dragon/272/Dragon's Bestiary: Diminutive Dragons|79}}

Swordfish inhabited the [[Sea of Swords]],the [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]],{{Cite organized play/LC/And the Deep Blue Sea|9}} and in the [[Golden Gulf]], off the coast of [[Sikak]] and [[Maribar Island]].

==Trivia==
*[[Longship]]s that hailed from [[Gundarlun Island]] often depicted swordfish on their figureheads.
*Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] had a mascot â€“ a green swordfish on burgundy background.
