        "mainbody": "A '''spirit of winter''' was a [[fey]] creature embodying the season of winter.",
        "Description": "Thickly muscled and covered in white fur, a spirit of winter exuded a thick mist that seemed to congeal the very air around it into heavy frost. Its roars very reminiscient of a raging blizzard.\n\nAlthough a spirit of winter did not communicate verbally&mdash;beyond its furious roaring, at any rate&mdash;it was capable of [[telepathy]].",
        "Abilities": "As a being of pure winter, a spirit of winter could fire various blasts of cold energy at opponents.\n\nA spirit of winter could be [[magic]]ally bound to a \"frost gem\" to harness its wintry power for some purpose, in which case the spirit would be encased within the gem until approached by a credible threat. The spirit would then manifest and defend the gem, and both the gem and the spirit would be damaged concurrently if either were attacked.",
        "Combat": "In addition to its frosty blasts, a spirit of winter was partial to slamming its opponents with its fists.{{Cite dungeon/159/Menace of the Icy Spire|22}}",
        "History": "A spirit of winter was bound to a [[sapphire]] by the [[fey]] of the [[Dire Wood]] to encase the [[Draigdurroch Tower|tower]] of the [[warlock]] [[Draigdurroch]] in ice. This was done because they feared his research into the latent [[divine magic|divine]] energy left behind by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]]-turned-failed-god [[Karsus]]. Unforunately, the cold energy emanating from the spirit of winter drew a group of [[ice warrior]]s from the [[Elemental Chaos]], who started fiddling with the ritual and expanding its strength and range of influence manyfold.{{Cite dungeon/159/Menace of the Icy Spire|5}}"
