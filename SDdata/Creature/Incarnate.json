        "Description": "Incarnates were invisible to other creatures, but if viewed through magical means they appeared to be multi-colored balls of light. Each was composed of the living energy of a certain abstract principle, such as evil, anger, courage, hope, etc.",
        "Abilities": "All incarnates possessed an immunity to harm from [[fire]], cold, and electricity. All were capable of draining creatures of their constitution by touching them, inducing feelings of weakness in both their victim's body and mind. When the constitution of a creature was completely drained away an incarnate could attempt to take over their victim. Afterwards, a creature's constitution would gradually return to them. The creature's [[alignment]] would also immediately, though only temporarily, change to match that of the incarnate possessing them.\n\nOnce in control of their body, an incarnate could use its host however it desired &mdash; actions, speech, spellcasting, etc. They also developed a [[telepathy|telepathic]] bond with them, allowing the host and incarnate to communicate. They also provided their hosts with varied unique abilities. One ability that all incarnates provided their hosts was an immunity to mind-affecting [[spell]]s.\n\nWhile inside them a host acted as a buffer between incarnates and enemies, with all attacks against them merely harming the host's body and not the incarnate. In addition, while possessed by an incarnate a creature could not be taken over by other incarnates or spirits, such as [[ghost]]s and [[haunt]]s, nor be affected by ''[[magic jar]]''.\n\nOnly the death of a host and certain spells could drive an incarnate out from a body. Minor incarnates could be driven out by the spells ''[[dispel good]]'' or ''[[dispel evil]]'' and ''[[limited wish]]''. Major incarnates could only be driven out from a host by means of ''[[exaction]]'', ''[[holy word]]'' or ''[[unholy word]]'', and ''[[wish]]''.",

They also granted their hosts the abilities of ''[[detect evil]]'' and ''[[protection from evil]] in a {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} radius'', which were always active, as well as ''[[turn undead]]''. They dwelled in [[Mount Celestia]], primarily on the layer of [[Chronias]]. They could sometimes be found on the layers of [[Jovar]], [[Mertion]], and [[Solania]]. On these planes they solely inhabited [[tome archon]]s and [[sword archon]]s. On the [[Prime Material plane]], they only took [[lawful good]] creatures as hosts. Such as some [[cleric]]s, [[paladin]]s, [[gold dragon]]s, [[silver dragon]]s, and [[lammasu]].\n[[File:Incarnate-DragonMag.png|thumb|right|''Some type of [[humanoid]] is possessed by an evil incarnate.'']]",

On their home planes they preferred [[baatezu]], [[demodand|gehreleths]], [[tanar'ri]], and [[yugoloth]]s as hosts. While on the Prime Material they had a preference for [[warrior]]s of good alignment, particularly [[ranger]]s and [[paladin]]s.

Unlike many incarnates, the creatures possessed by them did not display any obvious signs of possession. Their hosts were made to plot slow, devious campaigns of slander and rumor against their associates. Their hosts were perpetually jealous of the abilities and treasures of others. Their hosts would try to covertly have such treasures become lost, ruined, or outright destroyed. On the Prime Material they preferred to possess [[demihuman]]s that faced discrimination.

Their hosts were made to arrogant, conceited, and vain to an extreme degree. Consequently, their hosts tended to treat everyone around them as servants and get angry at any who failed to act servile. On their home plane their favored hosts were, in order of preference, greater baatezu, lesser baatezu, and least baatezu. On the Prime Material, they favored demihuman and human spell-casters as hosts.",
