'''Myrmidons''' were an unusual species of [[crustacean]] endemic to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

==Ecology==
They were typically found within estuaries, shallows, and shoals. They were valued by the [[Reghedmen]] tribes.

Their bodies contained a potent [[acid]] that could be harvested by gutting them.

===Uses===
When diluted with distilled water, myrmidon acid could be used to remove rust. This mixture was sometimes used in the restoration of old relics in [[the North]].

==History==
In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] an [[alchemist]] examining a myrmidon found that the acid contained within its body was in fact the same [[Wikipedia:Formic acid|type of acid]] that could be found inside of [[ant]]s. Following this discovery, myrmidons gave rise to a number of theories regarding what the biological relationship between crustaceans and [[insect]]s truly was.
