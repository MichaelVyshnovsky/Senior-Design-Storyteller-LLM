'''Efreet''' ({{Singular|efreeti|refs=}}) were a type of [[genie]] native to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. They were unpredictable creatures with fiery forms and spectacular magical powers.

==Description==
Efreet were humanoid in appearance. They were very tall, generally reaching heights of {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}}, and massive and solid, weighing {{SI|2000|lb|k|long=yes}}. They were well-muscled, and had red or black skin that was always burning. For this reason, many resembled [[devil]]s and were often mistaken for them. Their bodies were supposedly composed of basalt, [[bronze]], and solidified fire.

==Habitat==
Efreet were known to inhabit [[the sun]] of [[Realmspace]].

==Relations==
[[Fire elemental]]s avoided the efreet if they could, fearing their oppression and opportunism. Djinn hated them, and there were numerous battles between the two genie races. [[Dao]] were tolerated by the efreet, whom they traded worked materials with in exchange for raw metals. Most other races were treated by the efreet as either servants or slaves.
