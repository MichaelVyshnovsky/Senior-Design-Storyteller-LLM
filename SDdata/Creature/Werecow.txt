A werecow was an alleged type of lycanthrope that presumably could take the form of a cow or a cow-like humanoid hybrid. They were alleged to exist by some in the Domains of DreadIn the same passage it is claimed by van Richten that lycanthropes never take the form of herbivorous animals, which is evidently untrue as werebison and werestags exist in the Realms. With that in mind, his dismissal of the existence of werecows shouldnt be taken as an absolute that they dont exist.
* Bedford, a fictional werecow in the book Dusks Dark Desires.
