A '''werecow''' was an alleged type of [[lycanthrope]] that presumably could take the form of a [[cow]] or a cow-like [[humanoid]] hybrid. They were alleged to exist by some in the [[Domains of Dread]]In the same passage it is claimed by van Richten that lycanthropes never take the form of herbivorous animals, which is evidently untrue as [[werebison]] and [[werestag]]s exist in the Realms. With that in mind, his dismissal of the existence of werecows shouldn't be taken as an absolute that they don't exist.

==Notable Werecows==
* Bedford, a fictional werecow in the [[book]] ''[[Dusk's Dark Desires]]''.
