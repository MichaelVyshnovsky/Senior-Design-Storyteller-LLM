        "mainbody": "Mohrgs were vile undead that appeared as skeletons containing only their animated viscera.\nThey were the risen corpses of mass murderers and others whod committed similar crimes and never atoned before they died.\nA mohrg could be animated using the create undead spell, but only by the most powerful casters.\nA mohrg appeared as a gaunt, even skeletal corpse with a ribcage stuffed with still-fresh internal organs, which writhed sickeningly. Most notably, the tongue was long, cartilaginous, and ended in claws. Typically, mohrgs stood 5&ndash6 feet (1.5&ndash1.8 meters) tall as they had in life, and weighed around 120 pounds (54 kilograms).\nTrying to take their prey unawares, morhgs struck with their fists and grabbed hold, or else lashed them with their tongues. The very touch of their tongues could cause a being to be paralyzed for up to four minutes if they lacked the fortitude to resist.\nThose slain by a mohrg rose from the dead a day to four days later as zombies in all respects. Such zombies were controlled by the mohrg.\nThough similar to zombies, mohrgs moved as fast as a living human. They had fast reflexes and skills in stealth.\nMorhgs had an overriding hatred of all life. Yet, tormented by it, they yearned to live again themselves.\nMorhgs might be encountered alone or in gangs of up to four, and these gangs might have up to ten zombies with them.\nCirca 1372 DR, in Faerûn, lone mohrgs might be encountered in the Channath Vale, Dambrath, and Veldorn, while lone mohrgs or gangs of them might be encountered in all levels of the Underdark.\n* Kelthas the Dread, an evil necromancer who returned from death as a mohrg inhabiting the lower levels under Mount Illefarn.\n* Boran Klosk, imprisoned under the Temple of the Trembling Flower for over two hundred years, was released in the  to once again threaten Alaghôn."
