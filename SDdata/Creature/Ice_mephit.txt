Ice mephits were mephits composed of air and water. They were cold and indifferent,  and the most cruel of all the mephits.
In the ancient city of Cursrah, ice mephits were found in the kitchens of some nobles, where they were used to keep food chilled.
Ears of ice mephits could be harvested to be used in alchemy. Frosted ears could be processed into an alchemical sublimate of frosted mephit ears that, in turn, was mixed with certain types of ashes to brew arsonists oil.
