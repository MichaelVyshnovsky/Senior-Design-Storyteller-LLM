They fed off of memories and magical energy. They were particularly harmful when attached to wizards or priests, capable of erasing one spell per day from their hosts memory.\nA host infected with wizard lice needed to bathe with strong soaps or cleaning agents to effectively kill them. The cure disease spell was also a reliable method used to destroy wizard lice."
