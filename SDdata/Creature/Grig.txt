'''Grigs''' were a [[fey]] race and a type of [[Sprite (classification)|sprite]], notable for having the lower bodies of [[cricket]]s and for having an uncanny talent at playing a [[fiddle]]. They were mischievous fey who were fond of playing harmless pranks on "big people".{{Cite dragon/155/Folk of the Faerie Kingdom|34}}

==Description==
On average, these small sprites grew to be about {{SI|1.5|ft|c|long=yes}} tall and weighed only {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}. They had the head, arms, and torso of a normal sprite, with light blue skin and forest-green hair, as well as antennae. However, from the waist down, grigs had a brown, cricket-like body including a pair of gossamer wings and hairy legs. Grigs typically wore brightly colored tunics or vests with tiny [[gem]]s for buttons.

Like a male cricket, grigs could emit chirps by rubbing a ridged vein on their forewings against the hardened underside of their top wings, similar to the bow of a fiddle against its string.

==Personality==
Grigs were typically shy around strangers and overall good-natured and friendly. They were content to pass their time frolicking in idyllic meadows.

They were also lighthearted and loved to engage in mischief and pranks, especially against larger creatures—from their perspective, just about everybody.  Classic "pranks" included thieving food and items, causing [[tent]]s to collapse, making items appear to talk with their ventriloquism, gluing swords into their scabbards, scribbling rude images in the margins of [[spellbook]]s, rearranging furniture and even attaching it to the walls or ceilings, daubing sticky sap on things, putting holes in flagons, and chirping like true crickets to stir people trying to sleep. They usually loitered nearby to observe the outcome and have a good laugh. These were not intended to be cruel, however. To a grig, mischief was life. Opposing them would only amuse them and drive them to greater efforts. The only effective way of dealing with a grig was to be patient and not give it the reactions it was looking for, so it would quickly grow bored and go elsewhere. Otherwise, once they'd had their fill of fun or if they'd gone too far and caused genuine offense or grief, the grig would make amends with a small gift: a valuable jar of fresh [[honey]] or a [[gem]] or trinket, possibly originating from [[Faerie]] or the [[Feywild]].

With no desire for violence, they avoided fights at all costs, even apologizing if they must. Despite this, they would defend themselves if forced, against wicked creatures and those who attacked grigs.

Among all the sprites, grigs were the most energetic, being constantly on the move in search of activity and adventure and never resting. They slept for but a few seconds at a time, usually when [[feywine]] got the better of them. They played their music through the night to entertain and to annoy others.

==Abilities==
Like a [[bard]], grigs could weave [[magic]] from their music. Whenever a grig played a fiddle, they could compel any and all creatures within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} to dance uncontrollably, similarly to the effects of ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]''. Grigs and other sprites were immune to this effect and one grig could play for hours without tiring, though the same could not be said of those forced to dance for as long as they played—victims could well collapse in exhaustion ere that happened. After the [[Spellplague]], this was reduced to {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} and the forced dancing slowed and distracted those affected. And naturally, they were excellent players with an innate talent for music and the ability to compose tunes on the fly. One theory went that a grig's skill with the fiddle was because it functioned the same way their wings did when chirping. They could also make chirps of different notes and pitches to add a second "instrument" as a counterpoint to their fiddling.

Like many fey, grigs possessed other innate magical powers that they used to both protect themselves and play practical jokes on others. These replicated the spells ''[[disguise self]]'', ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'' (only themselves), ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[trip]]'', and ''[[ventriloquism]]''.

These fey could see in [[Low-light vision|low-light conditions]], the [[infravision|infrared spectrum]], or the [[ultravision|ultraviolet spectrum]]. Their visual range with the latter two senses was up to {{SI|180|ft|long=yes}}. In addition, their hearing was twice as good as any [[human]]'s. Altogether this made it very difficult to sneak up on them.

Thanks to their cricket legs and wings, grigs could jump vast distances, at least for their size. They were also adept at moving stealthily, especially in a forest setting.

==Possessions==
[[File:Grig fiddles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Left: a regular grig fiddle and (right) a master fiddle.'']]
In any band of grigs, one would carry a fiddle, sized for them.

For combat, grigs typically wielded a half-dozen [[dart]]s and tiny needle-like [[dagger]]s and [[sword]]s, [[longbow]]s and [[short sword]]s, or daggers alone. These variations may be due to the special knack they had with their weapons: accounting for size, a grig dagger was as good as a short sword in their hands, but no more than a knife in another's.

==Tactics==
Making up for their small size and weakness, they preferred to fight with clever tactics, ranged weaponry and magic, ambushes, and subterfuge, rather than in a face-to-ankle fight. They would throw their darts at creatures while in a hopping flight or leap and poke their foe with their blades in a nimble attack. Making up for their size, they were deadly accurate and quick, always jumping from place to place and with endless energy. They would also use their invisibility to fade out of sight before making a surprise attack.

==Society==
Grigs lived in temperate forests, specifically within glens, meadows, and woodlands. They didn't make any permanent dwellings, but regularly slept in the branches of [[treant]]s or close to [[unicorn]]s or made cozy little hollows in the sides of low hills.

They tended to sleep during the day and go out at night to forage for food, dance, and play. They were herbivorous, preferring to eat nuts, berries, and honey, but their favorite food was [[mushroom]].

They usually roamed in gangs of up to four or in bands of up to eleven or twelve. Tribes of grigs numbered twenty to eighty.

Among other fey in the [[plane]] of [[Faerie]], grigs served as minstrels and [[bard]]s. They played music and leaped and danced to entertain at fey festivals. Other fey appreciated this, for it kept the grigs busy and out of mischief. Grigs were said by others to be the most talented fiddle players in all of Faerie, and by grigs themselves to be the most talented anywhere, though others claimed [[leprechaun]]s alone were better.

Grigs had their own [[deity]], who was likely part of the [[Seelie Court]].<ref>

===Homelands===
In [[interior Faerûn|central]] and [[north Faerûn]], grigs were found in the [[midwood]] area of [[Cormanthor]],<ref> and more generally in the forests of [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and the [[Dalelands]],<ref> and in the [[Border Forest]].<ref> In [[west Faerûn]], they could be found in the [[Cloak Wood]]. In [[south Faerûn]], they might be found in the [[Forest of Amtar]].<ref> In the [[east Faerûn]], grigs could be found in the [[Forest of Lethyr]] and the [[Yuirwood]].<ref> In earlier times, they lived within the city dump of [[Cursrah]] and helped exterminate [[rat]]s.<ref>

Beyond [[Toril]], grigs were known to exist on the planet of [[Oerth]].

===Relationships===
Grig bands and [[atomie]] tribes were known to often gather together at night under the light of  the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]]. Altogether, there could be up to 50 grigs and 120 atomies at such gatherings. There they would, play, perform circle dances, and engage in a variety of pastimes, while some grigs would play their bowed string instruments.

The [[archfey]] and [[celestial eladrin]] of the [[Court of Stars]] had grig musicians to entertain at their events. Grigs were known to serve the deities [[Erevan Ilesere]] and [[Rillifane Rallathil]] of the [[elven pantheon]]<ref> and [[Sheela Peryroyl]] of the [[halfling pantheon]].<ref>

Unicorns would fight to the death to protect grigs.

Grigs occasionally befriended [[elves]] and others who respected the forest, and might even join a like-minded [[adventuring company]], at least one that would tolerate them.

===Languages===
Grigs spoke [[Sylvan]] and possibly [[Common]] or [[Elven]]. They particularly knew the Sylvan dialects of the atomies, [[brownie]]s, [[pixie]]s, and [[sprites]], as well as the grig dialect. Whenever they spoke in Common, a grig had to slow their speech and pitch downward in scale.

==History==
How grigs came to be, and how they got their legs, was shrouded in mystery. In some beliefs, they made some transgression against [[Rhiannon]], Queen of the Faeries, and she punished them with cricket legs, though others held she simply made them that way out of a sense of humor. Others theorized grigs weren't really faeries at all, but were the result of a [[wizard]]'s experimentations. Those who asked the grigs themselves found they did not seem to know, and did not really care.

In [[Cormanthor]]'s western [[starwood]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, a band of grigs stole the eggs of a female [[cockatrice]] while it was away hunting, as a so-called practical joke. Thereafter, the despairing cockatrice screamed incessantly from its [[oak]] hollow nest. Disturbed by the noise, a local [[elf]] family sought [[adventurer]]s who could get the eggs back from the grigs or else put down the cockatrice.<ref>
