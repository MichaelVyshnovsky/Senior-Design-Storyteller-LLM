The '''Beguiler''' was a species of exceptionally intelligent, non-aggressive mouse-like creature that possessed several astounding qualities.

==Description==
These [[magical beast]]s were the size of a small dog, about one foot tall and two feet long.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Beguilers were omnivores, preferring to eat water-rich cacti, field mice or the eggs of small ground-birds that were common to arid plains.

===Magical Powers===
In addition to having [[darkvision]] and [[low-light vision]], beguilers could naturally see through any [[illusion]] as per the [[spell]] ''[[true seeing]]''. They also had fur that was capable of giving them natural camouflage, or even change to fantastic colors that would not normally appear in the wild. These two traits made beguilers highly valued to both [[wizard]]s, to serve as their [[familiar]]s as well as poachers. It is unknown if their ability to speak the [[common]] language was also a magic ability.

The source of their magic has been mystery, though some that theorized their manifestations as a survival mechanism to evade their natural predators, the [[ethereal marauder]].
