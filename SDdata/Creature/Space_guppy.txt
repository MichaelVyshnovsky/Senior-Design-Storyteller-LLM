Space guppies were fish-like creatures that "swam" through the vast expanses of Wildspace and the Astral Plane.
They were approximately  long.
They could form a small air envelope that supported breathing for themself and one other tiny creature.

By all appearances, they seemed to be rather friendly.
Despite their innocent nature, they were not entirely defenseless. Space guppies could easily slap at predators with their fishy tails.
On some occasions, space guppies were taken on as mounts by space-faring chwingas, sprites, and other tiny creatures from across the planes.
