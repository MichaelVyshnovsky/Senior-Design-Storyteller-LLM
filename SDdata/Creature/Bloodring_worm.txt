Bloodring worms were small parasites found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These small worms had metallic skin and four red eyes that looked like small gems.
Bloodring worms curled their bodies into a circle, appearing just like a jeweled ring, and waited for a victim to put them around their finger. Once attached, bloodring worms feed off the blood of their host, using most of this energy to fuel their natural magic resistance. When well-fed they could grow up to one inch (2.5 cm) per week and reach a length of one foot (30 cm).
