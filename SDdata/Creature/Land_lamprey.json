        "History": "In the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], land lampreys were one of many creatures driven out of the [[Rat Hills]] by the [[Rat Hills Conflagration]] and into nearby [[Waterdeep]].",

They typically made their lairs within small caves.\n\nIn [[north Faerûn]] they could be found in the northern regions of the [[Moonsea]], around the ruins of [[Old Phlan]], and in [[The Vast]]. \n\nIn [[northwest Faerûn]], they were known to inhabit the Rat Hills dump near Waterdeep. In [[west Faerûn]], they could be found in the land of [[High Moor]].\n\nIn [[Zakhara]]'s [[Crowded Sea]], they could be found on the [[Djinni's Claws]]."
