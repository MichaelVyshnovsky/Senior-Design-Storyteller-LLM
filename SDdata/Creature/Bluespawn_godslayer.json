They were covered in blue scales and had dragon-like horns and claws.\nBluespawn godslayers were at their most deadly when fighting outsiders and good dragons. They were immune to electricity and utilized it in their attacks. They had little skill at ranged attacks and preferred to fight using melee weapons.\nBluespawn godslayers were the favored spawn of Tiamat, which they knew from hearing her distant roars in their dreams. In dragonspawn armies, they acted as heavy hitters and anchor points in the front lines.\nBluespawn godslayers, although deadly and arrogant, were not very smart and had little leadership ability. They valued their skill with melee weapons and disliked wearing armor.\nBluespawn godslayers were always sexless, hatching from the eggs of blue dragons. They were carnivorous creatures willing to eat anything that fell to their blades.\nThese dragonspawn were recorded living in Anauroch, the Calim Desert, and Raurin."
