        "Description": "Like other celestials, the appearances of guardinals varied&mdash;both among varieties and individuals Some guardinals appeared more animal-like, while others appeared more human-like.",
        "Personality": "Guardinals were quick to laugh and slow to get angry. They were the epitome of moral integrity and honor. They did not lie or cheat. Guardinals had zero tolerance for evil or injustice of any kind, and would travel out of their way to confront it. If evil came to their home plane, they became as ferocious as any [[Celestial archon|archon]].",
        "Abilities": "All guardinals could see in the dark and were immune to harm from electricity.They were resistant to the acid, cold, poisons, and intense sounds and could not be turned to stone by magical means. No animal could ever be compelled to attack a guardinal.\n\nGuardinals had a wide range of [[spell]]-like abilities, which varied among their kinds, but all guardinals could heal themselves or others by touch, much like a [[paladin]]'s divine ability.\n\nGuardinals were naturally fluent in the [[Celestial language]] and the [[Infernal language|language of devils]]. Most also spoke [[Draconic language|Draconic]]. However, they could communicate with almost any sentient creature using their innate magic, so in some sense, they could speak all languages. Moreover, they could telepathically communicate with any animals.",
        "Combat": "The style of combat favored by a guardinal depended on its type and its power. Among all varieties, they preferred to incapacitate, unless the enemy were irredeemably evil, in which case, they did not hesitate to use deadly force.",
        "Society": "Native to the House of Nature, in earlier cosmologies, guardinals were considered residents of [[Elysium]]. In either case, they lived simple lives, either alone or in small groups, often traveling through their beautiful, natural environment like nomads. They only ever took what was absolutely required from the land.\n\nWhile not under a strict hierarchy like the archons, There were many more guardinal paragons than these six; in fact, there was a paragon serving as a near deity for each of the many groupings of animals.The concept of guardinal paragons for different animals may have emerged from the [[Beast Lord]]s of the [[Beastlands]] from the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].\n\nGuardinals of all varieties served [[Mystra]], the goddess of [[magic]] in her home plane of [[Dweomerheart]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|13}} [[Avoral]] guardinals were in service to [[Aerdrie Faenya]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10}}",
