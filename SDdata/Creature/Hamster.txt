A '''hamster''' was a mostly harmless creature that came in several varieties.

==Description==
[[File:Giant space hamsters-2e.jpg|thumb|273px|''There were several offshoots of hamsters.'']]
Hamsters were small, that proved no threat to humanoids.

Though some hamsters were ordinary rodents, there were several different offshoots, most notably [[giant space hamster]]s.

==Ecology==
{{Quote
|Are you talking to a... hamster?  What kind of a warrior are you?
|[[Brathlen]]
}}
Tinker [[gnome]]s from [[wildspace]] were responsible for bringing giant space hamsters to an unrevealed place in the [[Realms]], and called themselves "hamster masters". Hamsters were sometimes kept by adventurers around the [[multiverse]], such as [[thieves]], and [[demihuman]]s, particularly [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s.

===Usages===

Hamsters were a delicacy served during royal balls and events in [[Sumbria]] of the [[Blade Kingdoms]]. The creatures were stuffed, sauced, and served by a platter-full.

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the deep levels of [[Undermountain]] contained [[polymorph]] traps. Such traps were able to capture a single being and transform them into a hamster.

{{Quote
|Truly, it is a small thing. As a child I had a pet hamster, named Spanky. Those were the only pure days in my life. Every day was perfection. Oh, the pain! If I could just hold a hamster while I die, perhaps I could capture the innocence of my youth and die a happy gnome.
