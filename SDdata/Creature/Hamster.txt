A hamster was a mostly harmless creature that came in several varieties.
There were several offshoots of hamsters.
Hamsters were small, that proved no threat to humanoids.
Though some hamsters were ordinary rodents, there were several different offshoots, most notably giant space hamsters.
Tinker gnomes from wildspace were responsible for bringing giant space hamsters to an unrevealed place in the Realms, and called themselves "hamster masters". Hamsters were sometimes kept by adventurers around the multiverse, such as thieves, and demihumans, particularly dwarves and gnomes.
