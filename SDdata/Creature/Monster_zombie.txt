'''Monster zombie''' was a general term for [[zombie]]s created from the corpses of large [[humanoid]] creatures, such as [[bugbear]]s and [[giant]]s.

==Behavior==
Monster zombies were capable of obeying simple commands or following instructions, but they could only be a few words in length.

==Abilities==
Much like other zombies, these creatures were impervious to harm from cold-based [[spell]]s and abilities. They were also immune to the ''charm'', ''hold'', ''sleep'' effects and [[death magic]]. They were vulnerable to [[holy water]] and turned by [[cleric]]s as if they were [[ghast]]s.

==Variants==
;[[Death shark]]: Though not created from the body of a humanoid, these undead [[shark]]s were considered to be a form of monster zombie.
;[[Ogre zombie]]: Zombies created from the corpses of [[ogre]]s.<ref>

==History==
Around [[1358 DR]], bands of monster zombies patrolled within the ruins of [[Dekanter]].<ref>

Some time prior to [[1363 DR]], the [[wizard]] [[Narthindlar]] set a monster zombie [[bear]] in [[Lemontree Alley]] to act as a guardian over its [[lemon]] trees.

In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was not uncommon to find monster zombies within the [[Starwood]].

==Ecology==
Monster zombies were typically created by [[evil]]-aligned [[cleric]]s and [[magic-user]]s. most commonly conjuring an ogre zombie.
===Habitats===
Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], this type of undead could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].

==Notable Monster Zombies==
* The wizard [[Amelior Amanitas]] owned a copper flask that could unleash a pair of fanatically loyal ogre [[berserker]]s to fight for him. If they died, the ogres would reanimate as monster zombies and continue fighting.
* A skull-headed, monster zombie [[ettin]] was one of the many [[undead]] creatures that guarded [[Cryptkey Facilitations]] in [[Skullport]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Around the 14{{th}} century DR, monster zombies were said to likely reside within the [[demilich]] [[Histokle Rireetha]]'s manor in [[Hawkgarth]].{{Cite polyhedron/124/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms: Hawkgarth|6}}
