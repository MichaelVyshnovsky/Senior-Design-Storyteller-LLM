'''Clams''' were a common type of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca mollusk] found across [[Faerûn]] from the [[Sword Coast North]]{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|93}} to the [[Unapproachable East]].{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}}

==Description==
Clams were simple marine creatures. Like most mollusks, they had soft bodies protected by hard shells.

===Types===
====Giant Clams====
[[File:Neverwinter - giant clam.png|thumb]]
Some clams, especially in warm waters, could grow to monstrous proportions, becoming [[giant clam]]s.{{Cite dragon/190/Deep Beneath the Waves|19}}

====Razor Clams====
[[File:Neverwinter - razor clam.png|thumb]]
Named for their shape (which was reminiscent of a [[straight razor]]), these clams lived in sandy shallows. They would withdraw into the sand to escape predators.

====Reef Clams====
[[File:Neverwinter - reef clam.png|thumb]]
These were named for their tendency to be found living in large reefs within temperate and cold waters.

===Uses===
Clams were a staple food in places such as [[Calaunt]] in [[The Vast]], [[Yeshpek]] in the [[Land of the Lions]], [[Skullport]] beneath [[Waterdeep]], [[Urbryur]] in [[Altumbel]], and the [[Dusk Ports|Dusk Port]] of [[Tarsith]]. They were also commonly eaten across much of western and central Faerûn in places like [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Cormyr]], [[Daggerford]], [[Elturel]], [[Immurk's Hold]], [[Luskan]], [[Neverwinter]],{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Living City: The Painted Boat Restaurant|15}} [[Scornubel]], [[Tulmene]], and [[Ten Towns]]. Clams were thus also an important trade good in locations where they could be harvested readily. They were a major export out of Yeshpek, and their sale was heavily regulated in Raven's Bluff such that they (along with several other forms of seafood) could not be sold within the city unless the transaction involved a member of the [[Fishmonger Association]].

Aquatic races used live clams kept in mesh bags as convenient [[ration]]s. 

Clamshells were sometimes valued as trinkets by the people of Faerûn. Empty clamshells were used by the undersea peoples of [[Serôs]] to store [[potion]]s and medicines.

==Ecology==
Clams were filter-feeders. In the presence of plentiful food, they could grow enormous.

===Habitats===
Clams were common in offshore reefs{{Cite dragon/106/More Range for Rangers|28}} Freshwater clams could be found in the rivers of the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Heartlands]] the [[Starwater River]] in Cormyr, [[Firedrake Bay]], Clams could further be found outside the [[Material Plane]], such as in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], at locations like the [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]], and in the depths of [[Ossa]], the oceanic second layer of [[Arborea]].

Clams were sometimes viewed as a nuisance by undersea races, who had to clear them from their buildings and construction sites.

===Predators===
Among many other kinds of seafood, clams were a favorite meal of [[deep dragon]]s. Clams were natural prey of animals such as [[starfish]] and [[feeblestar]]s&mdash;who used their limbs to break open clams' hard shells and [[octopus]]es.{{Cite dragon/190/Deep Beneath the Waves|22}} [[Vodyanoi]] were able to bite straight through a clam's shell to eat them.{{Cite dragon/250/Heroes of the Sea|34}}

Of course, [[humanoid]]s also ate clams, including most aquatic races. Some [[ranger]]s were skilled at finding them along coastlines, while [[sahuagin]] would plant them and other mollusks much like crops. Freshwater clams were farmed by the [[lizardfolk]] that dwelt in an unnamed swamp on the island of [[Raerest]] off the coast of [[Candlekeep]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180313201211/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_010203-05.htm| title = So Saith Ed Jan – Mar 2005| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==History==
[[Brymmyn Thorl]], a [[magister]] who lived during the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]], was fond of killing his foes by ''[[polymorph]]ing'' them into clams and leaving them to helplessly suffocate outside of water.

In the late 1360s DR, massive clam beds were constructed off the coast of Dawngleam by a joint venture among the [[merfolk]] of the Dragonmere and the [[human]]s of Cormyr as part of Dawngleam’s rapid expansion into an economic center.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, clams were sold at the [[Flying Fish]] market in Daggerford In Raven's Bluff, [[clam chowder]] was served at the [[Painted Boat Restaurant]], In Elturel, salted freshwater clams were served at [[A Pair of Black Antlers]] In Scornubel, clams were fried in [[butter]] at the [[Far Anchor]]. In Tulmene, they were baked into [[tart]]s at the [[Fast Sails]].
