        "mainbody": "'''Ice archons''' were a variety of [[elemental myrmidon|elemental archons]], beings created by conjuring and bonding [[elemental]]s into ritually created suits of [[armor]] to act as servile weapons of war.",
        "Description": "Ice archons were beings composed entirely of [[elemental ice]], with bodies that were roughly [[human]] in size and shape.\n\nLike all elemental archons,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} Their armor was all that would remain of them when killed.",
        "Abilities": "Ice archons were immune to the effects of [[disease]]s and [[poison]]s, as they were composed wholly of elemental essence.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|43}}\n\nHailscourges could conjure small hailstorms and jagged shards of ice resembling [[shuriken]]s in shape. Frostshapers and rimehammers lacked these abilities, but they both exuded an aura of cold that froze the ground around them. Additionally, frostshapers could conjure blades and [[javelin]]s of ice.",
        "Combat": "Hailscourges preferred to fight from afar over close-quarters. Because of this, they typically fought with no weapon, instead wielding shields of ice and relying upon their abilities.\n\nFrostshapers also relied upon their abilities, but used them to aid in fighting close-quarters. Finally, rimehammers solely preferred close-quarters, fighting with [[maul]]s of ice so numbingly cold that they impeded their enemies.",
        "Varieties": {
            "Frostshapers": "One of the more powerful varieties of ice archon. They sometimes served as advisors or commanders in elemental armies.",
            "Hailscourges": "The term used for the basic variety of ice archon. They often served as artillery in elemental armies.",
            "Rimehammers": "One of the more powerful varieties of ice archon. They often served as bodyguards for powerful elemental beings."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Creation": "Some said that constructing an elemental archon required a special foundry, with a special forge built in a significant concentration of elemental energy,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|42}} and a summoning crucible that served as the transformation space. These forges rarely appeared like a common forge, being unrecognizable contraptions of [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[elemental magic]].\n\nA working foundry could produce them as often as the ritual could be performed and for as long as the foundry's resources were maintained. The forge's power determine what kind of myrmidon was created.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|44}} A forge with ebbing power could only generate the most basic of ice archons, while those at high flow could produce more powerful varieties,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} such as rimehammers and frostshapers.\n\nA notable forge, controlled by ice archons and used to create more of their kind, was located in a part of the Elemental Chaos called the [[Crater of Blue Ice]].",
            "Homelands": "Like all elemental archons, ice archons could often be found in the Elemental Chaos. \n\nBeyond that [[plane]], a colony of ice archons existed in the [[Iron Wastes]] of the [[Abyss]], served by [[ice devil]]s. This colony lived there in search of an [[artifact]] [[spear]] that had belonged to an ancient [[primordial]] who they believed to be burred in the mountains that layer.<ref> Much further down in the Abyss, ice archons could be found on a layer known as [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 566: Soulfreeze|Soulfreeze]].",
            "Relationships": "Many ice archons were known to serve [[Cryonax]], the evil [[archomental]] of elemental ice.{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|25, 28}} Those that lived in Soulfreeze served the [[demon lord]] [[Aseroth]].{{Cite dragon/367/Hall of the Frostmaiden|62}}\n\nRimehammers were also known to serve creatures with ties to the Elemental Chaos, such as [[frost giant]]s, frostshapers, and [[frost titan]]s. But elemental archons in general had no aversions to working with creatures of other elements, so one could even see rimehammers working for such unlikely masters as [[fire giant]]s and [[efreeti]].\n\nAmong their fellow archons, ice archons worked better with [[earth archon]]s than [[fire archon|fire ones]], due to the former having similar approaches to warfare. And they were sometimes seen working alongside [[air archon]]s."
