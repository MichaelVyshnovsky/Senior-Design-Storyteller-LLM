Arcadian avengers were militant outsiders that acted as defenders of the planes of Arcadia and the House of the Triad. They could be summoned by the summon monster IV or the planar ally spells.
All Arcadian avengers looked remarkably similar, resembling winged human women of athletic build standing  tall, their skin and wings seemingly made of a silver-like metal.
In accordance with the ideals of Arcadia, most Arcadian avengers were of a lawful good bent, but a number of them that dispassionately valued the rule of law over benevolence fell into lawful neutrality.
Arcadian avengers wore armor seemingly made of the same metal as their skin and wings. They also wielded a pair of masterfully crafted longswords.
In the Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia, Arcadian avengers lived in grand barracks on the planes second layer, Buxenus.
Within the House of the Triad, a large group of Arcadian avengers were loyal to Helm.
