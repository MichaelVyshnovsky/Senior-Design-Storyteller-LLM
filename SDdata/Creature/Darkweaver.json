        "Abilities": "Darkweavers were able climbers, possessed [[darkvision]], and a form of [[telepathy]] that allowed them to communicate with each other from a distance of up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nIn areas of darkness or shadow a darkweaver was capable of creating two to five ''[[mirror image]]s'' of itself, as well as casting abilities that replicated the effects of the spells ''[[shades]]'', ''[[solid fog]]'', and ''[[symbol of despair]]'' once per day. \n\nDarkweavers could also travel between shadows in a way that was similar to the ''[[dimension door]]'' spell. A darkweaver could use this ability to travel up to a total distance of {{SI|320|ft}} each day, split into increments as small as {{SI|10|ft}}. The creatures were covered in natural armor made out of shadow-stuff; it aided them in hiding in shadows.\n\nBy far the most potent ability of darkweavers were the shadowy, semi-solid strands that perpetually surrounded them for {{SI|60|ft}}. This web, of sorts, provided concealment to all creatures within it, even from creatures with darkvision or [[blindsight]]. Only [[truesight]] allowed for normal vision. The web also prevented creatures that entered its area from going any direction other than that of the darkweaver. Darkweavers were naturally immune to the effects of their own and others' webs.",
