        "mainbody": "A '''quelzarn''' was a giant, [[eel]]-like water [[snake]] that was able to dwell in most kinds of large bodies of water.\n\n{{Quote|''You haven't heard of the quelzarn? Imagine a giant snake some forty feet long that can paralyze with a glance and swallow an [[elf]] whole. It doesn't normally attack ships, but it'll make quick work of any foolish enough to find themselves in the deep waters of the harbor.''|[[Little Davey]] of the [[Black Eye]] tavern}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Tantras quelzarn.png|thumb|''A quelzarn and its prey.'']]\nQuelzarn looked like eels and had slimy green or brown skin. The slime was often covered in growing weeds and [[moss]]. A quelzarn was usually around 30â€“40 feet long and had a spine-like fin along its back, as well as a crest on its head. It had a large fin covering each of its two gills, located behind its jaws.",
        "Subspecies": {
            "Greater quelzarn": "There was a variant of quelzarn known as a greater quelzarn.<ref name=tGHotR-p96> Greater quelzarn were widely regarded as exceedingly rare, if not vanished entirely, yet they were frequently chronicled in ancient [[Unther|Untherian]] hunting logs. Distinguished by their larger stature, they possessed the power of [[spell turning]]. These creatures were remarkably clever and astute, often setting traps for hunting vessels and occasionally forming alliances with other denizens of the sea."
        },
        "Habitat": "Quelzarn could dwell in fresh- or saltwater and were highly tolerant of pollution. They could be found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters. They were solitary creatures.\n\nQuelzarn were attracted to magical items. They were sometimes mistaken for [[naga]]s.",
        "Combat": "Quelzarn would eat any living thing. They could use a ''[[hold monster]]'' ability to freeze their prey before snatching it with their jaws. Prey were swallowed hole, left to drown inside the quelzarn's gullet. Quelzarn were highly resistant to [[magic]] and immune to all electrical attacks.",
        "Uses": "The quelzarn's digestive juices served as a strong [[acid]]. Their cranial fluids served as useful [[ink]]s for spells such as ''[[slow]]'' and ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', etc. Quelzarn tissue was used in ''[[wand of lightning|wands of lightning]]''.  Its skin was useless once removed.",
        "History": "[[File:Quelzarn 3e.jpg|thumb|''Quelzarns in [[Westgate]].'']]\nThe origin of quelzarn was unclear, but it was believed to have originated from a magical source, perhaps Unther, where the quelzarn had been hunted for sport.\n\nIn [[678 DR]], Lord Councilor [[Kharis Maerdrym]] disappeared off the coast of [[Delthuntle]] while participating in a Grand Hunt of the near-legendary great quelzarn.<ref name=tGHotR-p96/>"
