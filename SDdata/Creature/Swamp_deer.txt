Swamp deer were a small species of deer that inhabitanted swampy areas.
Swamp deer were quite small, standing  at the shoulder. They were well-camouflaged and could blend into their swampy habitats.
When another creature got close to a swamp deer, it would freeze in place, allowing it to take full advantage of its camouflage and making it surprisingly hard to spot. Any sudden movement would then spook the deer, causing it to flee.
Swamp deer made for a good meal if they could be caught.
They could be found in the boggy parts of Vaasa during the summer months.
