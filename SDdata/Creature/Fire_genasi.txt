A fire genasi was a type of genasi that was able to harness the power of fire.
Many fire genasi carried obvious traits from the Elemental Plane of Fire, such as coal-colored skin, flame-like hair, and fiery eyes.
Fire genasi were usually born from the union between an efreet and a humanoid, from two fire genasi, or from humanoid parents with an efreet somewhere in their ascendancy. They could also result from exposure to fire elemental energy.
Fire genasi could summon nonmagical flame. They were also resistant to fire.
Fire genasi were generally energetic and quick to act, They often cared a great deal about their appearance, and dressed flamboyantly.
Fire genasi could be found anywhere, but were most commonly found in Calimshan,
Fire genasi could worship any deity, but clerics were devotees of Gond, Talos, or Kossuth.
