'''Octons''' were the third lowest rank among the hierarch [[modron]]s.

==Description==
Octons looked like an elongated cylinder that tapered to a point at the top. Just below this point and on either side they had a set of two eyes and a mouth. About a third of the way down their body was a collar-like "shoulder" ring that encircled their entire body. Attached to this ring were eight evenly-spaced tentacles.

==Combat==
If forced into combat, an octon used a combination of innate abilities, spells and their tentacles.

==Abilities==
Like all hierarch modrons, octons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Additionally, they were able to duplicate the effects of ''[[detect evil and good]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'' and ''[[water walk]]'' spells. Octons were able to cast [[divine]] spells from the [[Law domain|Law]], [[Protection domain|Protection]] and [[War domain|War]] domains. Octons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind and all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.

==Society==
There were exactly 64 octons in modron society. They acted as governors to each of the sixty-four sectors of [[Nirvana]]. As such, they were considered responsible for the base modrons of their sector, as well as the [[decaton]]s and [[nonaton]]s that were assigned to them. Each octon had a personal staff consisting of one decaton, one nonaton, five [[pentadrone]]s, sixteen [[quadrone]]s, eighty-one [[tridrone]]s, two hundred and fifty-six [[duodrone]]s, and one thousand, seven hundred and twenty eight [[monodrone]]s. They maintained small towers, which resembled smaller versions of the towers of the [[quarton]]s, the [[Secundus|secundi]], and [[Primus]].

==Ecology==
Octons were able to float through air and water with equal ease. Locomotion was provided by forcing either air or water through its collar-like shoulder ring. Due to the position of their eyes, octons had a 360 degree field of vision and could see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}. Octons were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within {{SI|80|mi|k}}.
