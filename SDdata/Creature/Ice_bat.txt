Ice bats were a hairy species of bats that dwelt in the deep frozen caverns of the Sunrise Mountains of Thay.
Ice bats were a bigger subspecies of ordinary bats, known for their thick, soft, and velvety fur. The creatures sharp claws were more dangerous than their smaller cousins as they were used to hold on to the smooth ice-crusted walls and ceilings of their habitats.
Ice bats nested in big groups. All the creatures hung in big pillowy clusters, holding each other close to preserve heat. If startled, the entire cluster exploded in a swarm of claws and wings, disorienting any creature attempting to hunt the bats.
In Mirtul 1373 DR, a Sembian noblewoman and a rogue, Thazienne Uskevren, traveled to the Sunrise Mountains in search of the fabled crimson gold. She encountered a swarm of ice bats as she fled from the buried ones.
