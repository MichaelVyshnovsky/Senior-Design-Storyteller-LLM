        "mainbody": "Thorns were small fey warriors who acted as guardians of other fey creatures. They took their name from the longswords they carried, which were constructed from thorny plants. Most thorns in Faer√ªn lived in the Dalelands or Cormanthor.\nThorns would attack anything that threatened other fey. They preferred to sneak up on opponents and carried sleep arrows, which caused adversaries to fall into a slumber. They also had the ability to launch a sneak attack.\n* Briarsting, the guardian of a dead druid in the City of the Dead in Waterdeep.\nCampfire stories were told about both thorns and petals to children in the Dalelands to keep them from journeying too far into the forests there."
