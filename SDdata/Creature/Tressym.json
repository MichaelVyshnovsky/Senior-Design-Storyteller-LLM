        "mainbody": "A '''tressym''' was a [[magical beast]] resembling a small winged [[cat]]. They could be found across the warm and temperate lands of [[Faerûn]], and were most common in northern [[Cormyr]], particularly in the village of [[Eveningstar]] where they were seen as good luck charms and mascots and praised for keeping down rodents. They were also popular as [[familiar]]s for good [[wizard]]s.\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": {
            "Traits": "[[File:Tressym.png|thumb|right|250px|''A black-furred tressym.'']]\nA tressym was classified as a magical beast.{{Cite web enhancement/Monster Update|6}}<ref group=\"note\">The tressym was originally classified as an ordinary animal in ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'', but this was changed to a magical beast with an update to v.3.5 and in ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]''. This also added an array of new vision types for the tressym. However, the update mistakenly attributed the tressym to ''[[Monsters of Faerûn]]'', rather than the ''Campaign Setting''.\n\nCombining the sensory abilities of the cat and the owl and a magical beast, the tressym was equipped with a number of natural and supernatural senses. First, they had the cat's native ability to find and follow a scent. To see in the dark, they possessed [[infravision]] or [[darkvision]], as well as the ability to see in low-light conditions. Furthermore, they had the ability to sense invisible creatures and objects up to {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} away. Finally, through either taste, touch, or scent, they could also detect [[poison]]s that were harmful to the sentient folk of the world.\n\nHowever, tressym were themselves immune to apparently every known kind of poison, suffering no ill effects whatsoever. This ability could not be conferred to other creatures, however.\n\nTressym had skills in stealth, climbing, balance, and alertness comparable to a regular cat, but were of course a little better at balancing and climbing owing to their wings. However, they didn't have nearly the same talent for jumping.\n\nTheir wings were not strong enough to carry great weights. They could not carry a [[halfling]]; if a halfling was falling, a tressym might strain to haul them up, and could do little more than slow, but not break, their fall."
        },
        "Behavior": "[[File:Tressym MC.gif|thumb|right|''Tressym were often solitary beasts.'']]\nTressym were highly intelligent, being a little above average [[human]] intelligence. They could not speak human languages, They were semi-wild, and most people thought of them as \"mischievous little terrors\", but otherwise tended to be shy and skittish.\n\nThey were often solitary creatures, rarely living or hunting with others of their kind, though did usually get along fine. Some bonded with individuals of other races, like [[elves]] and humans, forming close friendships. Stories told of heroic tressym sacrificing themselves to save beloved companions. Equally, they could have strong hatreds of those they disliked. They enjoyed teasing [[dog]]s (which could not give chase) but not to the point of danger. They ignored and left in peace birds (when not preying upon them), [[griffon]]s, and other flying creatures. However, they were deadly rivals to [[stirge]]s and [[manticore]]s, to the point that packs of tressym would gather to combat them.",
        "Combat": "Like ordinary cats, tressym typically stalked and pounced on their prey, using their claws and fangs to slay it. However, the ability to fly gave them a new dimension to hunt in and made them much more dangerous to birds and insects. They could also get into aerial catfights.\n\nOtherwise, they avoided fighting with anything larger than themselves, by flying away and hiding. If pursued by larger flying creature, then they would go to ground and seek a small hole or crevice to conceal themselves in.\n\nNevertheless, they were cunning and quick learners, knowing enough to scratch a foe's eyes and soon learning the danger of weapons and wands held by people.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Locations": "[[File:tressym and primal tree-5e.jpg|thumb|270px|''A group of tressym flying around a tree infused with [[primal magic]].'']]\nIn the wild, they could be found in warm and temperate lands. They could easily find and take shelter from bad winter weather, or fly away from it entirely.\n\nIndividual wild and domestic tressym could be found all over Faerûn, albeit very rarely. They only appeared to gather and breed in large numbers in northern Cormyr,\n\nA clowder of wild tressym dwelled at the [[Leaves of Learning]] temple to [[Oghma]] in [[Highmoon]] in the Dalelands. Cormyrian traders had brought them from Eveningstar to [[Deepingdale]] to sell in the High Market, but the winged cats escaped and flew to the temple. They laired in the temple's Inner Court, becoming beloved companions to the priests and monks. They were allowed free access to the kitchen and pantry to hunt [[rat]]s and [[mice]]. The tressym would alert the temple staff if they spied a visitor acting suspiciously or a thief climbing over the walls.{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|10, 11}}\n\nThere were a number of tressym in the city of [[Ankhapur]] in the [[Lake of Steam region]]. Curiously, on the day before [[Highsummer]] each year since [[1368 DR]], every tressym in the city mysteriously disappeared in the night, even from within cages. None knew where they went or why. The winged cats only returned three days later, with people simply seeing them again they when they woke up. Talk in the taverns about this centered on the [[Shadi'ar]], or Lion tribes, and how their god [[Nobanion]] was said to have visited Ankhapur in [[1367 DR]], the year before the first disappearance of tressym.\n\nTressym could also be found roaming the settled lands of [[Aglarond]] and [[Altumbel]] during the day.",
            "Reputation": "[[File:TressymVV.jpg|thumb|left|''A tressym showing off its wings.'']]\nIn Eveningstar, tressym were highly appreciated by both the villagers and the local farmers for their control of rodents in the fields.{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|51}} and fed them and gave them free run of the village. while trying to limit their vandalism and airborne catfights. Mages regularly came to Eveningstar seeking a tressym as a familiar, but the locals tried to stop large-scale and magical trapping of them.\n\n[[Ghostwise halfling]]s viewed tressym as emblematic of stealth and cunning. Ghostwise mages sometimes chose them as familiars, and on occasion a [[druid]] adopted one as animal companion. They also occasionally became pets or companions of clan matriarchs or patriarchs.\n\nDruids who dwelt in harsh desert wastelands could also bond with a tressym as a companion animal.<ref>\n\nA number of deities and their religions were strongly associated with tressym. Prime among these was [[Sharess]], goddess of cats, and [[Lurue]], goddess of intelligent animals, as well as [[Cyrrollalee]], the halfling goddess of friendship, and the elven deities [[Aerdrie Faenya]], goddess of air and flight; [[Erevan Ilesere]], god of mischief; and [[Hanali Celanil]], goddess of love. Tressym could be the servants of these deities, or were sent by them as signs of their favor, or could even be sacred to their faith.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts}}"

        "Uses": "[[File:Tessaril Winter.jpg|thumb|right|''Lord [[Tessaril Winter]]'s tressym familiar was often found perched on her shoulder.'']]\nTressym were sometimes kept as [[familiar]]s by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s. They needed to be experienced mages capable of bonding with a more advanced creature, and the tressym would only accept a [[good]]-hearted master. As familiars, tressym combined the senses of cat and [[owl]], and furthermore were intelligent enough for many more tasks, being able to carry and operate complicated and delicate items to the limit of their capability, to fully observe and report on events, to concentrate on activities without distractions, and to safely identify poisons and toxic gases.\n\nThus many mages, particularly good ones, sought out tressym, often coming to Eveningstar to find them.\n\n[[Tsarra Chaadren]], a sorceress of [[Waterdeep]], also had a tressym familiar, called \"[[Nameless (tressym)|Nameless]]\".\n\nApart from familiars, tressym made for popular pets. [[Calishite]] humans, who enjoyed exotic, magical pets, were drawn to tressym, among other magical beasts. [[Chondathan]] humans, particularly in Cormyr, favored felines and so especially appreciated tressym. In the [[mage]] kingdom of [[Halruaa]], tressym were among the most popular exotic pets seen strolling along the [[Halarahh]]'s [[Promenade (Halarahh)|Promenade]] in the evenings, beside their masters.\n\nAlthough a tressym's immunity to poisons reportedly could not be conferred upon other creatures,",
        "History": "The tressym were believed to the product of a wizard's experimentation long ago.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the {{YearlinkName|1263}}, that they became widespread in Faerûn. As the name of the year suggested, this had been foretold by [[Alaundo|Alaundo the Seer]] himself, as early as the {{YearlinkName|75}}.\n\nThe sorceress Tsarra Chaadren acquired a tressym familiar around {{Yearlink|1364}}, but even after a decade of bonding with him, he did not tell her his name. Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] took to calling the winged cat \"[[Nameless (tressym)|Nameless]]\", which the cat didn't mind. Nameless had a jet-black coat and mismatched eyes, one blue eye and one green.",
