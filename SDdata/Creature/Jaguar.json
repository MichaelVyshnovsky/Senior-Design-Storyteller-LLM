        "mainbody": "'''Jaguars''' were large, jungle-dwelling [[feline]]s.",
        "Description": "Jaguars were similar in size and appearance to leopards, but were somewhat bulkier and had spotted rosettes. They had golden fur and black spots, but a rare few had black fur and black spots, and were called black jaguars.",
        "Combat": "Jaguars were ferocious predators, and greatly feared by any [[humanoid]] who lived in their territory. They were aggressive and attacked any creature they saw as a potential threat. They stealthily stalked prey, usually from above in the tree cover. Their sharp claws delivered devastating wounds. A jaguar was capable of jumping a distance of up to {{SI|30|ft}}.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diets": "Jaguars were obligate carnivores. Despite spending a significant part of their day in the tree tops, jaguars were excellent swimmers. Being solitary creatures, jaguars only mingled with others of their species for mating. A female jaguar had a litter of up to three cubs.",
            "Habitats": "Jaguars were typically found in jungles and were very territorial.\n\nBeyond [[Faerûn]], jaguars were found throughout Maztica",
            "Relationships": "Jaguars had a significant place in Maztica, even having a month named after them in the Maztican calendar. They were the namesake of the [[Jaguar Knights]] of Maztica, and a holy symbol of the god of war, [[Zaltec]].\n\nJaguar claws were a token of [[hishnashaper]]s and used as a [[material component]] in certain [[hishna]] spells. Mazticans used tough strands extracted from jaguar guts to craft snares to capture [[parrot]]s and other [[bird]]s used for ''[[pluma]]'' magic.\n\n[[Wild halfling]] villages in the jungles of [[Far Payit]] kept jaguars, using them to kill any prisoners.\n\n[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']]'' ''sold jaguar hides for 25 [[gp]] a piece."
