        "mainbody": "'''Treants''' were a wide variety of [[awakened]] trees.",
        "Description": "Treants typically had face-like features on their bark, a division between their trunk that formed legs, and long branches that served as arms.",
        "Personality": "In their adolescence treants were often more energetic, rebellious, and reckless.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/Treant Variety}} But as they aged treants preferred to while away their days in quiet contemplation, rooted in place as though they were a normal tree.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Senses": "Treants remained aware of their surroundings while rooted in place. They could perceive the effects of events happening miles away based on subtle nearby changes.",
            "Magic": "Treants that came from the mightiest of trees could develop innate magical powers, allowing them to animate plants and call upon woodland creatures. Using them either as protectors or messengers."
        },
        "History": "According to the ''[[Encyclopaedia Deifica]]'', the existence of treants in [[Faerun]] allegedly predated the arrival of [[elves]] and [[illithid]]s.",
        "Species": {
            "Cormanthor": "The treants in the forest of [[Cormanthor]] became hosts for [[rot grub]]s, which lived off rotting wood. If a treant was affected by [[tube wilt]], it would open up a small crack and let the grubs in. The grubs would eat through all the rotten wood, eating the fungi causing the disease, and usually remain for good and tackle subsequent rot. This relationship did not harm either party, and older, larger treants might contain up to a hundred of these grubs.\n\nIn order to ward off predators such as [[woodchuck]]s or wood-eating [[horse]]s, the Cormanthor treants surrounded their roots with up to six [[Cormanthor violet fungus|Cormanthor violet fungi]], whose roots tapped into the treant itself, using its sap as sustenance, and they would attempt to rot the flesh of any would-be predators.\n\nIn order to combat the threat of [[bark beetle]]s and [[leaf ant]]s, which could damage the treant, they encourage [[azmyth]]s and large [[bat]]s to make their homes in their branches.\n\n[[Black squirrel]]s fed on the female treants' shoots, which helped to limit the treants' population.",
            "Maztica": "The treants that inhabited [[Maztica]] were fairly similar in appearance to those found in Faerûn, though they were not hostile to creatures foreign to their woods and instead preferred to ignore them. They considered themselves to be royalty of the forests they inhabited and expected other creatures to treat them as such, including giving them gifts.",
            "Western Heartlands": "Many young treants in the [[Western Heartlands]] resembled [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwoods]], while those in their adolescence often chose to resemble [[bluewood]]s."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Languages": "Treants were generally capable of speaking [[Common]], [[Elvish]], [[Sylvan]], and the [[Druidic language]]. In addition, they had [[Treant language|their own unique language]].",
            "Relationships": "Some treants willingly allowed [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]] to build little villages within their boughs.\n\nTreants were opposed to creatures that were careless with [[fire]], poisoned trees, or destroyed great trees. Especially those that destroyed trees close to awakening into a treant."
        },
        "Notable Treants": "*[[Sequaxion]], a treant who lived in the garden of the [[For-Rest Inn]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] and acted as its gardener.{{Cite polyhedron/49/The Living City: The For-Rest Inn|29}}\n*[[Seven seedlings of the verdant sages]], a group of immature offspring of the most ancient and wisest treants of [[the North]] known of in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n*[[Turlang]], a treant who guarded the northwestern region of the [[High Forest]], a grove known as [[Turlang's Wood]]."
