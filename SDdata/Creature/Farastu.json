        "mainbody": "Farastus (  tall and weighing somewhere between . Their bodies were badly emaciated with elongated limbs, long-nailed hands and possibly wings. Their large, oblong heads hosted massive jaws laden with teeth. A black, viscous, tar-like substance coated their grotesque frames, constantly oozing and trickling to the ground.\nFarastus were hateful creatures made angry and vengeful by their low position in demodand society. Despite knowing their purpose from the beginning of their existence, their lack of power left them incapable of fulfilling it, leaving them full of resentment. Higher-ranking demodands persecuted the farastu and so when unsupervised, they, in turn, bullied entities weaker than themselves. Their cruelty and malevolence were allowed to fully manifest when not being watched by their superiors and escape attempts by their wards were seen as enjoyable opportunities to express their rage.\nThey were especially irritable towards summoners that tore them from Carceri, attempting to kill them or at least disobey their orders, regardless of the importance of the task at hand. Farastus were as intelligent as the average human and when forced to conduct a service against their will, plotted revenge against their supposed master. In an attempt to exact revenge upon the world they would destroy nearby lands and enslave native populations.\nFarastus were incredibly powerful and dangerously fast, able to rip apart most enemies with ogre-like strength. They could fly into a deadly rage similar to that of a barbarian and their acute sense of smell made them capable trackers. Their tar-like secretions allowed them to stick to terrain and opponents alike, making them excellent climbers and dangerous grapplers. The tar also allowed them to disarm their foes as weapons had a tendency to stick to their bodies while also protecting them from flames and frost. If compelled, farastus could liquefy themselves into puddles of tar and later reform.\nA farastus first instinct upon seeing a non-demodand was to attempt to violently tear it to pieces with no regard for their personal safety. Despite the plethora of spell-like abilities available to them, they preferred to wade into combat with their natural weapons, whipping themselves into a frenzy as soon as possible and robbing their victims of their weapons. Their malicious savagery didnt overpower their ability to make intelligent decisions, such as wielding a powerful weapon they managed to steal from their targets.\nFarastus suffered under the spiteful command of the two other types of demodands, forced to perform menial chores, guard duty and other undesirable tasks for their supposed mistake. Demodands, despite the collective memory provided by their obsidian triangles, could not recall what action resulted in their exile to Carceri, but the higher castes believed it to be the fault of the farastus. Hated even by their own kind, tarry leths had a reputation as the lowliest of demodands and were thought to be weak and feeble. On the other hand, their complete lack of fear gave rise to the phrase \"as brave as a farastu\", that served as both a compliment and an insult.\nIn addition to their native tongue, farastus also spoke Abyssal.\nWhile farastus could dissolve their tarry coating at will, dousing them with flammable oils also broke down the adhesive. The death of a farastus caused the tar to dissolve after a minute and a new farastus to rise from one of the rotting corpses of Carceris dead.\nWhile farastus were said to be summoned accidentally by wizards attempting to call fiends, they could be specifically summoned using the summon monster IX spell."
