        "Description": "These creatures were the size of a large [[golden retriever]] and had gleaming coats of fur that were color of [[honey]]. Around their necks they wore [[satin]] [[collar (animal)|collars]], from which a [[gold]] [[coin]] hung, bearing the [[holy symbol]] of Tymora.",
        "Behavior": "These dogs remained resolutely focused on their assigned tasks, ignoring attempts to magically communicate with them.",
        "Abilities": "Honey dogs were divinely protected by Tymora from most physical and magical forms of harm, as well as from being [[charm]]ed. Their fur coats were magical, imparting an effect similar to ''[[cure light wounds]]'' when petted. And the gold coin around their collars restored a few basic [[spell]]s for any [[spellcaster]] that touched them.",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], following the [[War with Myrkyssa Jelan]], the [[Beshaban]] [[priest]] [[Vandavar]] orchestrated a series of dognappings in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Dog Days of Summer|2}} As she had a fondness for dogs, the goddess Tymora was disturbed by these circumstances and decided to manifest a pair of honey dogs in the city to help a group of [[adventurer]]s that were investigating the string of disappearances. There they manifested near the [[You Can Buy Love]] pet shop and led the adventurers to the city's wharf before disappearing, where the adventurers soon found their next lead on the case."
