        "mainbody": "Honey dogs were a divinely magical breed of dogs that belonged to the goddess Tymora. They would manifest in the Realms on her behalf to help those in need.\nThese creatures were the size of a large golden retriever and had gleaming coats of fur that were color of honey. Around their necks they wore satin collars, from which a gold coin hung, bearing the holy symbol of Tymora.\nThese dogs remained resolutely focused on their assigned tasks, ignoring attempts to magically communicate with them.\nHoney dogs were divinely protected by Tymora from most physical and magical forms of harm, as well as from being charmed. Their fur coats were magical, imparting an effect similar to cure light wounds when petted. And the gold coin around their collars restored a few basic spells for any spellcaster that touched them.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, following the War with Myrkyssa Jelan, the Beshaban priest Vandavar orchestrated a series of dognappings in the city of Ravens Bluff. As she had a fondness for dogs, the goddess Tymora was disturbed by these circumstances and decided to manifest a pair of honey dogs in the city to help a group of adventurers that were investigating the string of disappearances. There they manifested near the You Can Buy Love pet shop and led the adventurers to the citys wharf before disappearing, where the adventurers soon found their next lead on the case."
