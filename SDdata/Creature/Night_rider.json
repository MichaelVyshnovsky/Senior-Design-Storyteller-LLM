        "mainbody": "'''Night riders''' were a variety of [[undead]] warrior. More powerful and dangerous than a [[zombie]] or [[skeleton]], they were used as guardians or servants by more powerful undead or even by the [[god]] [[Myrkul]], Lord of Bones, most prominently during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]].",
        "Description": "Night riders appeared as decaying corpses, invariably seeming to be zombies, sometimes partially skeletal or even complete [[skeleton]]s. Their skin was withered and their eyes were dried out, and they stunk of rotting flesh.",
        "Personality": "Although possessed of low intellect, a night rider was not mindless like a zombie or skeleton, making it much more dangerous than either, and profoundly evil besides. It retained a little of the intelligence and skills it had in life, so night riders appeared to be drawn to places they'd once lived or often visited. The only time they made a sound was to chuckle or cheer exultantly when they struck a foe.",
        "Combat": "For all that they resembled zombies and skeletons, night riders were much more powerful. They were faster than zombies, but still a little slower and clumsier than they would've been in life, usually being sluggish to react in battle or to dodge a ranged assault. They were capable of subtle military tactics, not only charging head on but also keeping forces in reserve and hanging back, and attacking and retreating to harry their opponents.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Night rider - chill touch.jpg|thumb|left|''Timoth suffering under the cold hand of death.'']]\nTheir very touch was unnaturally cold, harming all living things they touched and sapping their strength for an hour. For the same reason, they couldn't use anything that required the touch of a living creature. Being dead, they didn't feel pain and didn't need to eat.\n\nDue to their great inherent evil, they could emanate a ''[[protection from good, 10' radius]]'', [[spell]] whenever they willed. They could also conjure ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'', as they pleased.\n\nThey were immune to ''[[charm]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[hold monster|hold]]'', and cold [[spell]]s. They were however vulnerable to healing magic, which reduced their unlife energy and did as much damage as would've been healed on a living creature. They were also harmed by [[holy water]].\n\nThey moved and fought in utter silence, which could be quite disturbing.",
        "Society": "Night riders were rare, being animated from corpses by a few [[lich]]es and wicked [[cleric]]s, but most notably by the god Myrkul himself. They were usually found serving him or greater undead. Created for a purpose, they were typically employed as servants or guardians and went where they were ordered.\n\nThey had no organization of their own, but were found alone or in groups of three to two-dozen night riders. They were often found among other undead, especially the zombies and skeletons they were indistinguishable from. Many night riders were companions of the skeletal [[horse]]s known as [[gaunt]]s or deadmounts, hence their name.",
        "Possessions": "They could use any kind of weapon, but some of those who served Myrkul wielded ''[[scythe]]s of [[sword of wounding|wounding]] +1''. Many wore and carried whatever they'd had before being raised. For example, a group raised from the bodies of a [[Purple Dragons]] patrol still wore [[chain mail]] and [[surcoat]]s with the [[Cormyr]]ean insignia and were armed with their [[lance|light horse lance]]s, [[long sword]]s, [[mace]]s, and [[dagger]]s, but did not use their shields.",
        "Notable Night Riders": "During the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, in [[Cormyr]] on [[Eleasis 28|Eleasias 28]], the [[avatar]] of Myrkul raised thirteen bodies of a patrol of Purple Dragons, together with their horses, as night riders mounted on gaunts. They were led by their former sergeant, [[Ogden Fastrunner|Ogden the Hardrider]]. Myrkul sent them into [[Hermit's Wood]] to kidnap [[Midnight]] and seize one of the [[Tablets of Fate]] as her party camped, and kill the rest. However, the adventurers managed to defeat the night riders. Later, in early [[Eleint]], as the adventurers crossed the [[Tun Plains]], Myrkul sent sixteen riders to suddenly charge them out of the night. He could send night riders to harry them throughout their journey.\n\n[[File:Heal and night riders.jpg|thumb|right|''Night riders versus [[centaur]] riders!'']]\nMeanwhile, [[Luna]], [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Kyriani]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Timoth Eyesbright]] encountered a trio of scythe-wielding night riders in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] and they battled through the warped streets. Timoth disarmed one, but was struck by its cold touch instead. Finally, Luna disabled them with a ''[[heal]]'' spell, and the group hurried off.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|10-14}}\n\nOn [[Marpenoth 1]], Midnight, [[Adon]], and [[Kelemvor]] arrived at [[Dragonspear Castle]], but Myrkul hurled an army of gaunt-riding night riders at them (a dozen were once merchants, still riding living horses) and raised more within the castle grounds, from the bodies in the burial chamber. Overwhelmed by over seventy night riders, Midnight, Kelemvor, and Adon were scattered and the Tablet of Fate taken. Some of night riders delivered the tablet to Myrkul in Waterdeep.\n\n[[File:Servants of Myrkul.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Myrkul's Legion attacking Waterdeep.'']]\nFinally, on [[Marpenoth 15]], the [[Battle of Waterdeep]] broke out as Myrkul appeared at the head of a legion of night riders, and together they stormed [[Blackstaff Tower]] to fight the heroes. Later, a horde of them erupted from the sewers to assault and pursue them, but the [[magic]] of [[Hades]] sent them berserk, with many night riders attacking each other if no living foe was in reach. The night riders protected Myrkul to the end. Afterward, [[Elminster]] wiped out the leftover night riders with a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' spell."
