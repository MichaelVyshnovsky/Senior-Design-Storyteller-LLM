'''Walruses''' were a species of large aquatic mammal.
==Abilities==
A walrus was capable of holding its breath for an extended amount of time. It was also a powerful swimmer.
==Behavior==
Walruses were territorial and aggressively defended it.
==Combat==
The two large tusks of a walrus were dangerously sharp, and made for effective weapons.
==Ecology==
Walruses lived in herds or as a mating pair, but some were solitary animals. Walruses inhabited cold oceans, living among ice floes, and arctic coasts. Male walruses were larger in size and population compared to females.{{Cite dragon/137/What's For Lunch?|14}}

In the Realms, walruses could be encountered in the [[Great Glacier]] region, the northern shoreline of the [[Hordelands]] and the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. Walruses previously inhabited [[Paw Bay]] within the [[Narrow Sea]] in the old [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]].

==Uses==
Residents of the Great Glacier used walrus skin in the construction of [[Umiak]]s. and were worth up to 36 [[gp]] a piece. and [[cloak]]s. Walrus hide could also be used as a parchment.

==Relationships==
The [[Ice Hunters]] worshiped the walrus spirit as one of their [[deities]]. Known as [[Grandfather Walrus]], the specialty priests of this spirit refrained from harming walruses, eating their meat or fat, and wearing anything made from them.<ref>
