Walruses were a species of large aquatic mammal.
A walrus was capable of holding its breath for an extended amount of time. It was also a powerful swimmer.
Walruses were territorial and aggressively defended it.
The two large tusks of a walrus were dangerously sharp, and made for effective weapons.
Walruses lived in herds or as a mating pair, but some were solitary animals. Walruses inhabited cold oceans, living among ice floes, and arctic coasts. Male walruses were larger in size and population compared to females.
In the Realms, walruses could be encountered in the Great Glacier region, the northern shoreline of the Hordelands and the Sea of Moving Ice. Walruses previously inhabited Paw Bay within the Narrow Sea in the old Netherese Empire.
Residents of the Great Glacier used walrus skin in the construction of Umiaks. and were worth up to 36 gp a piece. and cloaks. Walrus hide could also be used as a parchment.
The Ice Hunters worshiped the walrus spirit as one of their deities. Known as Grandfather Walrus, the specialty priests of this spirit refrained from harming walruses, eating their meat or fat, and wearing anything made from them.
