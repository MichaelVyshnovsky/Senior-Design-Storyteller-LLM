'''Book imps''' were a variety of [[imp]]s from the [[Nine Hells]] with mastery of knowledge. Dispatched by the powers of Hell and summoned to the sides of mortal spellcasters, they offered advice and temptation alike to those who sought ancient secrets.

==Description==
Books imps were tiny [[fiend]]s that appeared as winged [[humanoid]]s. Their bodies were ridged, big [[bat]]-like ears stuck up from their skulls, and they had black eyeballs and yellow pupils.

==Behavior==
Book imps flittered around their masters constantly, whispering tantalizing, ancient, long-forgotten [[arcane]] secrets into their ears.

==Abilities==
Book imps' mere presence while under the control of their masters boosted the summoner's physical and magical abilities. They granted the summoner increased resistance to fire, the ability to speak and read the [[Infernal language]], improved their understanding of magic and history, and by their master's will could briefly become invisible. They themselves were known to be able to ''[[blink]]''.

==Combat==
Book imps were not formidable opponents. When forced into combat, they ''[[blink]]ed'' around their opponents, raking them with sharp caws from unexpected angles. They were quick creatures who dealt impish flurries of attacks.
