Book imps were a variety of imps from the Nine Hells with mastery of knowledge. Dispatched by the powers of Hell and summoned to the sides of mortal spellcasters, they offered advice and temptation alike to those who sought ancient secrets.
Books imps were tiny fiends that appeared as winged humanoids. Their bodies were ridged, big bat-like ears stuck up from their skulls, and they had black eyeballs and yellow pupils.
Book imps flittered around their masters constantly, whispering tantalizing, ancient, long-forgotten arcane secrets into their ears.
Book imps mere presence while under the control of their masters boosted the summoners physical and magical abilities. They granted the summoner increased resistance to fire, the ability to speak and read the Infernal language, improved their understanding of magic and history, and by their masters will could briefly become invisible. They themselves were known to be able to blink.
Book imps were not formidable opponents. When forced into combat, they blinked around their opponents, raking them with sharp caws from unexpected angles. They were quick creatures who dealt impish flurries of attacks.
