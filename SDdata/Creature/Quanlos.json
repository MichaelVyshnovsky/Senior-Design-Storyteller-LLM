        "mainbody": "'''Quanlos''', sometimes known as '''abyssal wasps''' due to their common misidentification as fiends, were insectoid creatures that lived in hot swamps and procreated by injecting their carnivorous larvae into living creatures.",
        "Description": "Quanlos were approximately a size of a [[dog]], {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} long and had two sets of loudly buzzing wings with the wingspan of {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}}. Their chitinous abdomens ended in long dangerous-looking stingers.",
        "Behavior": "Quanlos were drawn to bright shiny trinkets such as [[coin]]s. It was the only type of treasure that could be found within the quanlos territory. When they enthralled [[humanoid]]s, the abyssal wasps commanded their victims to drop any and all shiny objects to be added to the quanlos' hoard.",
        "Abilities": "These insects possessed the ability to see in the dark, limited to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. Quanlos produced a type of strong magical venom that, when injected via the stinger, acted like a ''[[dominate monster]]'' [[spell]]. This venom destroyed the victim's will and made them susceptible to mental compulsions issued by quanlos—this compulsion was greatly limited by the creatures' intellect. The only commands quanlos could give out were basic ones, like attack, bring food, flee, etc. A single quanlos could control a number of victims via its venom. The older and more powerful a quanlos was, the more creatures it could keep enthralled. The venom's effects ended immidiately when the quanlos that injected it was killed.\n\nPerhaps the most danger when facing quanlos came from their devouring larvae. The larvae were injected via quanlos stingers and could infest a single creature with several larval quanlos. Such injection, if successful, doomed the victim to be consumed from the inside by the insectoids' larvae. The devouring began as soon as the larvae were injected and continuously feasted on the victim's insides until the host died or received curative magics, such as ''[[remove disease]]'' spell or someone successfully surgically removed the larvae. There was a way of stopping quanlos from injecting its opponents with the larvae – by dealing a certain amount of magical or mundane cold damage. It prohibited the quanlos from producing larvae for 24 hours.",
        "Combat": "Quanlos avoided direct confrontation when possible. Instead of entering battle, they sent enthralled creatures forward while watching the scuffle from a hiding spot, waiting for an opportunity to pounce in and inject the poison into the attackers. The only time quanlos were extremely aggressive and attacked their prey on sight was when they lacked thralls.",
        "Society": "These monstrosities were territorial and solitary, only sharing their domains with enthralled creatures that defended the territory, hunted for food, and, eventually, became incubators for their young. Most commonly, quanlos used beasts as their thralls, such creatures as [[wolves]] and [[bear]]s.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Usages": "Quanlos stingers were precious and could be shaped into ornamental [[dagger]]s and enchanted into ''[[daggers of venom]]''. An undamaged stinger could be sold for as much as 1,000 [[gp]]. Quanlos venom was quite valuable and was valued at 50 gp per dose. A single quanlos could be harvested for between one to four doses of the venom."
