        "mainbody": "The Render was a unique unholy creature created by combining a summoned tanarri with a human prisoner.  Due to its unnatural union, the Render was in constant agony.\nThe Render was created in the experimental labs of Darkhold. The process was an accident while permitting the demon to kill the human for pleasure, a Zhentarim wizard miscast a spell from an unknown scroll, causing the creatures to fuse. The wizard creator died, and hundreds of others died as well before the beast escaped.\nIt escaped into the Far Hills to the south of the citadel, where the Zhentarim continued to hunt it. The Zhentarim were desperate to catch it, but all attempts resulted in failure, with those hunting down the beast often dying in the process.\nThe creature was possibly slain by the Hero of Daggerford in 1373 DROssian Studios (August 2019). Designed by Luke Scull. Neverwinter Nights Tyrants of the Moonsea. Beamdog.\nThe Render stood nine feet tall. It was covered in deep black, short fur that covered its entire body the fur was matted down with a slimy mucous-like sweat. Its teeth and claws were between five and nine inches in length, and razor-sharp its claws were often caked with the remains of its last victim. Its eyes were amber-colored and luminescent.\nThe Render could digest any organic material, not caring how fresh it was. It needed to eat at least twice a day, and killed without mercy or regret. It was likely the most deadly creature that could be encountered in the Heartlands."
