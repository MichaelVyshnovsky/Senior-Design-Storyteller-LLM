        "mainbody": "Blue abishai were the second-highest of the abishai devils. Like their true dragon counterparts, the blue dragons, they had a supernatural affinity to lightning and were highly intelligent. \nBlue abishai were the most well-learned of their kind, possessing vast, scholarly knowledge and devilish guile. They sought out lost lore, searched for ancient relics, and researched occult tomes and spellbooks from across the planes. Their spellcasting was primarily used in aid of their queen Tiamat.\nThe barbed stinger on the end of a blue abishais tail induced a powerful electric shock. Even without their magic, they were naturally armed with fangs and claws.\nThese abishai were prolific spellcasters, knowing several wizard spells that controlled the environment, manipulated minds, or purely destructive spells related to frost and electricity such as cone of cold or chain lightning. While they could attempt to call in a small group of lemures they could also try to summon other abishai, primarily of the blue or green caste. When forced into close combat, a blue abishai could strike out with their quarterstaff or bite and claw at their enemies. As well as staves, such abishai were also known to wield tridents."
