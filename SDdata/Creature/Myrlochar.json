        "mainbody": "'''Myrlochars''', also known as '''soul spiders''', were [[demon]]ic minions of [[Lolth]] with the appearance of oversized arachnids. They were often summoned by [[drow]] [[cleric]]s to track down the enemies of the Dark Mother like giant hunting spiders.",
        "Description": "The monstrous myrlochars were 3 feet (0.9 meters) long in body, but their legs were 6 feet (1.8 meters) long and their forelimbs seemed elongated. They resembled emaciated spiders with a chitinous exoskeleton ranging in color from brown to russet ti ivory-yellow. While their bodies exuded a faint greenish-yellow light, their eight eyes glowed a vibrant red. Their voices were ghostly and hissing while their jaws were razor-edged.",
        "Behavior": "Myrlochars were vicious and cruel, often toying with their prey and seeming to genuinely enjoy hunting and killing. They did not spin webs as most spiders, although they could freely navigate the webs of other large arachnids.",
        "Abilities": "Myrlochars were dangerous hunters, with acute senses so they could operate in complete darkness, and they could move in complete silence whenever they wished. Capable of vertical ''[[levitation]]'' and easily scaling walls, most terrain posed no challenge for them to navigate. They normally used their levitation abilities to carefully fall to the ground. Their most notable ability however laid in their vitality-draining fangs. The bite of a myrlochar could permanently sap the strength from a person and render their stolen vigor onto the soul spider. Myrlochars also had the option of causing their bite to [[hold person|paralyze]] the victim or reverse their gravity.\n\nThey could regenerate most injuries, including lost limbs.",
        "Combat": "Despite their emaciated forms, myrlochars were surprisingly agile and strong, often attacking with their bony forelegs before attempting to bite their prey. They could also adhere the tips of their legs to many objects, allow them both to freely climb most surfaces and to pick up and&mdash;to a limited extent&mdash;use weapons such as [[pole arm]]s. \n\nMost mental effects were of no use against them&mdash;including [[magic]] meant to put them to sleep, hold them in place, or charm them&mdash;and neither were [[poison]]s and [[web|webbing]].",
        "Society": "Due to occupying a lower rank than [[yochlol]]s, myrlochars were much easier for drow priestesses to summon to the [[Material Plane]]. They were normally summoned alone or in packs in rituals, either for worship or information or in order to ask for their aid. Normally the request was to hunt down escaped foes of Lolth who fled into the [[Underdark]]. Like Lolth's Handmaidens, myrlochar would normally obey a single order from their summoner that they completed without question before being free to wreak havoc on their current [[plane]].\n\nWhen a follower of Lolth that had fallen out of her favor attempted to summon a yochlol for a service other than worship, she often sent an uncontrollable and rampaging myrlochar to greet them with no way to send it back outside of killing it.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "The powdered bones of a myrlochar could be used as a powerful component when making [[magic items]] relating to ''[[free action]]'' and ''levitation''."
