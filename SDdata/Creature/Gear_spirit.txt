'''Gear spirits''', known to some scholars as '''Mechanus dryads''', were [[Mechanus|Mechanical]] creatures that tended to the plane's many gears. Contrary to their name, gear spirits were physical creatures made up of metal, typically in the shape of common mechanical devices or tools.

==Notable Gear Spirits==
The rogue [[quadrone]] [[Nordom]] wielded a pair of gear spirits that took the shape of [[crossbow]]s.
