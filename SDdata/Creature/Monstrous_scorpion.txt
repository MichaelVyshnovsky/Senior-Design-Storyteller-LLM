Monstrous scorpions or giant scorpions were a breed of arachnids known for their venomous stingers. They were found in warm deserts.
On the continent of Faer√ªn, giant scorpions could be found in the Anauroch desert, the Calim Desert, the Raurin Desert, and the Quoya Desert. They could also be found in the jungles of Chult, including a rare subspecies known as venomtail scorpions, whose poison was highly sought after by local hunters.
In Zakhara, the Wind of Fate often applied venom from giant scorpions to their blowgun darts.
Some races were known to use their chitin to construct armor.
Monstrous scorpions were known to be used by members of the Refuge Bay Trading Company of Chult. These scorpions were either trained or magically bound to a representative, both as defenders and enforcers. One of these representatives with a giant scorpion could be found in Baldurs Gate docks circa 1360 DR. The scorpion served as hands of his master, as he lost one hand as punishment, and the other was paralyzed in a fist. The monstrous scorpion was also a reminder and overseer of that Refuge Bay Trading Company to ensure he never stole from them again.
* In the land of Anauroch, many Bedine told tales around campfires of epic battles between these creatures and giant spiders. Such tales were rooted in observed facts and had morals, though ulugarr typically considered them to be nothing more than legends.
Unlike some giant arachnid species, such as the less widespread solifugid and uropygus, monstrous scorpions were not considered to be spiderkind.
