They also had mild paralyzing venom.\nEvery ten years, a salamander laid a single egg that hatched into a fire snake. Fire snakes lived in deep pits on the Elemental Plane of Fire, where they were often tended by flamebrother salamanders. Some of these beings remained as fire snakes their entire lives, while others would metamorph into flamebrothers.\nFire snakes were known to keep gems as treasure.\nDuring the Era of Upheaval, fire snakes were known to dwell within plane of Heliopolis."
