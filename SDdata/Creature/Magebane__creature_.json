        "mainbody": "Magebanes were small, flighted creatures who fed of magical energies. They were infamous in Faerûn for harrying mages and ruining their spellcasting, much to their chagrin.\nThese creatures resembled bats with somewhat amorphous bodies. They had long, barbed tails and ten spindly legs that extended from their underbellies.\nMagebanes could readily detect magical auras, which served them well when searching for their next meal. They were entirely invisible and silent, except to any spellcaster they designated as their source.\nThey were immune to all forms of psionics and as such could not detect residual psionic energy.\nMagebanes fed on magical energy. They would designate a \"chosen\" arcane spellcaster to be their \"source\" of food. Whenever that individual cast a spell the magebane absorbed the energy in a manner similar to a rod of absorption. These spells would either experience reduced effectiveness or fizzle out entirely.\nThey continued to follow their \"chosen\" mages until a more powerful source of magic made itself apparent.\nRather than using their magic-absorption method of feeding, magebanes utilized meager physical attacks in combat. They would slash at others with either their claws or pointed tails.\nIn Faerûn, magebanes could be found in underground areas such as caverns. They were also known to inhabit the plane of Pandemonium and possibly other outer planes.\nThe flesh of these creatures, as well as a powder made from their claws, were highly valued as an alchemical reagent. An intact magebane carcass could sell for as much as 400 gp."
