The coloration of their fur allowed them to blend into their habitat seamlessly. Unlike most cats, cheetahs were unable to retract their claws.\nCheetahs were the fastest natural land animals known to scholars of Toril, able to attain speeds of nearly  when sprinting.This value is calculated using v.3.5 rules. For comparison, the fastest horses in v.3.5—the Calimite, Chionthar, Dambraii, Lhesperan, and Raurin—can reach . In the real world, some horses can reach speeds of over , and cheetahs have been clocked well over , but v.3.5 consistently gives lower maximum speeds for animals, likely because the Monster Manuals include representatives of average specimens.\nCheetahs were skilled hunters and used their speed and jumping ability to tackle prey. Their sharp claws and fangs were deadly natural weapons. They could jump up to  horizontally and  vertically. Cheetahs were especially dangerous when protecting their cubs, for which they fought to the death in their defense.\nCheetahs were territorial creatures, but often lived with others of their kind. Female cheetahs had litters of up to four cubs, who remained by her side for two years.\nCheetahs were obligate carnivores and targeted antelopes as their primary source of food. They rarely attacked humanoids for food.\nThese creatures were typically could be found in warm grasslands and prairies.\nCheetahs were found on the plains in Durpar, Estagund, Halruaa, Semphar, the Shaar, Var, Some cheetahs also lived within the forest of Cormanthor.\nCheetahs were the only great cat species that could be properly domesticated.\n*Calliope an animal companion and a circus animal from Jack Mooney & Sons Circus in Ravens Bluff in the mid 14 century DR."
