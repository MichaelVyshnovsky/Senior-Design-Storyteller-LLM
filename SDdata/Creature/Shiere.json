        "mainbody": "'''Shieres''' were the horsemen and warriors among the [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]] and defenders of their twilight courts. They were the most powerful of the lesser eladrin.",
        "Description": "Shiere eladrin resembled extremely tall, lanky [[high elves]]—averaging {{SI|7|feet|c|long=yes}} or more—with exceptionally fair skin. Their faces and hands were long and narrow. They had pale golden or silver hair and blue, green, or violet eyes.\n\nShieres were often seen mounted when on duty.",
        "Personality": "They were honorable and courageous, gathering together at night to ride through [[Olympus]] in the defense of [[Arborea]]. No shiere would ever consider betraying her or his lord or failing to uphold a promise to a friend. Shieres were much colder in temperament when dealing with others not as honorable or courageous. They were the least likely to leave their home [[Cosmology|planes]].\n\nShieres were always [[Chaotic good|freedom-loving and good]] in their outlooks.",
        "Abilities": "Shieres were very strong and dexterous and were highly skilled fighters. The most highly advanced were skilled enough to strike many enemies at once in a whirling attack.\n\nShieres had all of the abilities common to other eladrin. In addition, they could cast many [[divine magic]] spells and had a number of other innate powers, such as the ability to [[Alter self|change their appearance]], to blast a damaging [[Color spray|spray of color]], to create a [[Continual light|continuous source of light]], to [[detect evil]] and [[See invisibility|invisibility]], to create [[Major image|a major illusion]], and to strike foes with an [[ice storm]], a [[wall of ice]], or a [[cone of cold]]. Once, twice, or three times per day, a shiere could gather the magical [[positive energy]] to fully [[heal]] an ally.\n\nShieres were resistant to spells and attacks from mundane weapons but were weak to weapons forged from [[cold iron]], as were many [[fey]] creatures. They were immune to any enchantment spells that might change their moral and ethical alignment.\n\nThe gaze of an angry shiere would cause fear in any evil opponent.\n\nIn their alternate form, shieres appeared as a ball of harmless light—like that of a [[coure]]—which allowed them to fly. Unlike all other eladrin, shieres could not easily change into their alternate forms; they could only do so once every hour or once every day and it took them a significant amount of time—as long as an hour—to change back into a humanoid form afterward. Thus, they only changed form in the direst of need, such as if badly injured or needed to deliver a crucial message.\n\nShiere eladrin could [[Comprehend languages|comprehend any language]], but they usually spoke and wrote in the Eladrin language.",
        "Combat": "When ready for combat, shieres wore magical glass or crystal [[plate armor]] and carried narrow magical shields. Shieres favored the weapons of knights, such as [[battleaxe]]s, [[flail]]s, [[lance]]s, [[longsword]]s, or [[mace]]s. Their weapons were always magically enchanted, often with [[Weapon quality|special qualities]]. The weapons were often gifts or rewards from their [[tulani]] lords for good service. The most successful shieres received weapons from Queen [[Morwel]] herself.\n\nA shiere's heavy [[warhorse]] was a fearless and swift beast who had been magically enchanted with the power of flight, but the magic only functioned at night. The most accomplished of shieres were known to ride [[favonian]]s, a horse breed unique to the chaotic [[Upper Planes]].",
        "Society": "Shieres were the most numerous of the eladrin subraces present in the twilight courts of the tulani. A host of shieres defended the [[Morwel|Queen of the Stars]]. They sought out evil before it could come to them and rooted it out from Arborea. Shieres also lived in the [[elven]] realm of [[Arvandor]] and the [[Gates of the Moon]], but they rarely served in any role but that of warrior.\n\nAll shieres shared the same official rank; however, in practice, some of the most wise of their number were selected by their tulani lords to serve as captains or leaders, but only for the purposes of specific services.\n\nThe most successful and powerful shieres were invited to serve in Queen Morwel's famed honor guard as knights. Some of those knights were assigned jurisdictions over parts of Arborea, and they established strongholds in such regions. The rest of her honor guard were reserved for special missions.\n\nThe goddess [[Lliira]] particularly favored them as divine servants.\n\nShieres were known to hunt such monsters as [[behir]]s, [[bulette]]s, [[dragon]]s, and [[owlbear]]s and [[fiend]]s of all kinds. They were most active at night, spending most of their active time on mounted patrol. They were not permitted to leave their planes without the express permission of their lords. However, if a tulani had reason to leave the Upper Planes, a squad of shieres often accompanied him or her.",
        "Ecology": "Shieres were not immortal, yet their lifespans were long. A typical shiere could live for over 650 years."
