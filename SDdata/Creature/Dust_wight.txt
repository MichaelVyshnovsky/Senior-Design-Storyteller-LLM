'''Dust wights''' were a type of [[undead]] creature that formed from conjunctions of [[elemental earth]] and [[negative energy]].

==Description==
These resembled [[earth elemental]]s, albeit the size of a [[human]] and with gaunt forms. They were always surrounded by a small cloud of dust and despite their appearance they weighed around {{SI|400|lbs.|k|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
Dust wights sought to destroy all things constructed of metal or stone. They were pleased whenever it was necessary to kill living creatures in order to accomplish this.

==Abilities==
Creatures or objects constructed of metal or store, such as [[shield guardian]]s and [[stone golem]]s, would be weakened when bashed by the fists of a dust wight. In addition, the dust clouds that surrounded them had a [[petrification]] effect.

Dust wights were equally affected by ''[[turn undead]]'' and [[spell]]s that rebuked creatures of elemental earth.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, a group of [[adventurer]]s discovered some dust wights within an abandoned guardhouse inside the tomb of the [[Netherese]] scholar [[Augathra the Mad]].

==Ecology==
===Languages===
Dust wights only knew the [[Terran]] language.
