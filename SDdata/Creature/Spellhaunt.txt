A spellhaunt was a very rare being that was formed from spells that were cast somewhere they should not have been.
Spellhaunts were glowing humanoid apparitions, apparently taking the form of the spell they were formed from. Although they more or less looked like this, no two spellhaunts looked alike. Spellhaunts formed from cloudkill  resembled greenish-yellow clouds of vapor, whilst those formed from enervation appeared as dark shadows.
Only magic-users and those that carried enchanted equipment had to be wary of such creatures, as they fed off of magic of any type. 
Being only semi-intelligent, spellhaunts could not employ complex tactics. However, they could sense magic up to  away for each effective spell a victim had on them. This made it simple for spellhaunts to locate potential opponents. 
The attacks of spellhaunts ignored all armor, and inflicted moderate damage, as well as stripping magical enchantments. They were immune to all spells, except for those that cancelled magic, such as dispel magic.
These beings could be found in specific places, where magic was not meant to be cast, such as in the deep reaches of Watchers Keep, south of Amn.
Spellhaunts were also known to be found in places where the rules of things were out of the ordinary, seeking magic. If they did not get their fill of magical energy, they would simply wither and die.
