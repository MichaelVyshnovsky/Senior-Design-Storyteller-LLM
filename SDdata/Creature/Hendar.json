        "mainbody": "Hendar were a rare, fierce aerial predators.\nHendar had the body of a large, black worm. Its head looked like that of a large horse. Its pair of wing resembled those from a giant bat. Hendar had a mane of hair which greyed as they aged.\nHendar were sentient, possessing an average level of intelligence. They were known for their foul temper and vanity.\nHendar could swim as well as they could fly.\nHendar hunted while in the air or underwater, as well as attacking a target on land. In the air, they preferred to use their strength and weight to crash into a target, stunning them and inflicting grievous injuries, causing the target to fall out of the sky. A common tactic used against air-breathing targets was to wrap the target in its strong tail and drag them underwater, drowning its prey. Conversely, hendar used the same tactic against aquatic targets, but rising and dragging them into the air until they died from exposure.\nHendar were solitary creatures and loathed the company of other hendar, thus they lacked any sort of societal structure. The only time two hendar tolerated each others presence was during their mating season as well as to parent their young.\nHendar were endemic to the Sword Coast, between Amn and Luskan. They could be found living in ruins or within cliff-side caves. They were also known to live within moors and swamps. Since their skin was sensitive to dryness and cold, hendar avoided areas with low humidity. Hendar were extremely territorial, they did not tolerate the presence of other large predators in their claimed territory.\nHender were omnivores but preferred fresh meat, with humans being their favorite prey. They only needed to hunt about once a week. Hendar were long-lived creatures and mated every thirty years. A female hendar had a clutch of up to eight eggs, but roughly half successfully hatched. The parents remained with their young for about a year. The rarity of hendar was attributed to their low birthrate and the fact most juvenile hendar did not survive to reach adulthood.\nHendar spent the cold Sword Coast winters hibernating. When they awoke in the spring, they were a ravenous, hunting and eating up to twice a night. After a month, their eating habits returned to normal."
