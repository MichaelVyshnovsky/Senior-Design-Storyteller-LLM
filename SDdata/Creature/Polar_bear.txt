'''Polar bears''' were a type of [[bear]] adapted to cold environs.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}}

==Description==
Polar bears had white coats and were long and lean. When standing, they stood taller than [[brown bear]]s.

==Behavior==
A polar bear was a superb swimmer. Its white coat also gave it an advantage when hunting in snowy areas.

==Combat==
When a polar bear attacked, it primarily used its powerful claws, tearing at its prey, as well as its bite. It would also pull its opponents into a grapple.

==Ecology==
Polar bears heavily populated the region of [[Nakalpgotak]] on the [[Great Glacier]]. They preyed upon many animals, including even those as large as [[ghost roth√©]].

==Uses==
Polar bear meat was barely edible to most people. It was tough and stringy and hard to digest. The Iulutiuns ate polar bear meat Likewise, [[Nakulutiun]]s consumed polar bear meat, as did the [[Ice Hunters]] of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. Among non-humans, the [[Arctic dwarf|''Innugaakalikurit'']] wore polar bear fur as well. [[White dragon]]s and [[tirichik]] also preyed upon polar bears.

Polar bear bone was carvable. 

==Reputation==
Polar bears were important in the culture of the [[Iulutiun]]s of the Great Glacier, where a child's first polar bear kill was celebrated with a ritual known as the [[Ulutiun dictionary#N|''nukiewquak'']], in which the bear's head was kept on a pole outside the family house for many days. The first polar bear kill of the year was also celebrated. Polar bears were associated with the virtue of courage within the Iulutiun culture.

Powerful [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s sometimes had polar bears as companions.

==History==
The famous wise man of the Iulutiuns, [[Inum]], had been crippled by a polar bear. [[Heafstaag]], king of the [[Tribe of the Elk]] of [[Icewind Dale]] had had his hand mauled by a polar bear.
