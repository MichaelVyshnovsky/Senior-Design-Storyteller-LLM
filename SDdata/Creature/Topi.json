        "mainbody": "A topi was a type of small undead.\nA topi was created by shrinking a corpse to two feet tall, and then cutting out its heart and replacing it with a live poisonous snake in a leather bag. The snake would stay alive without food or air, and simultaneously render the topis claws venomous. The snake would die when the topi died.\nA significant number of topis resided on the Snout of Omgar, particularly near the ruins of Dangwaru."
