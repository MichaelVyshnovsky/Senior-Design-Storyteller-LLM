        "mainbody": "Nymphs were fey said to be natures embodiment of physical beauty they were also guardians of wild places.\nNymphs were about the height and weight of a female elf, but they were blindingly beautiful.\nSome considered nymphs to be the most wild and capricious type of fey.\nNymphs in cold climates were often known to hunt upon the backs of wolves.\nOther types of nymphs besides the normal forest kind included grain nymphs and unseelie nymphs.\nCompared to Faer√ªn, nymphs were a more common occurrence on the Evermeet, though still relatively rare. There they inhabited forests, glades, and valleys.\nIn the Zakhara regions Crowded Sea, nymphs could be found on the island chain of Nada al-Hazan and the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan.\nNymphs were sometimes sent as agents of the elven gods Corellon Larethian or Erevan Ilesere.\nAmong the elves that inhabited Evermeet, nymphs were viewed as being spiritual representatives of the elven gods and they in turn seemed to be positively inclined towards them, rarely harming elves. Some of the islands elves, especially those of the green and silver variety, purposely sought them out.\nNymph.png|A nymph from 2nd edition."
