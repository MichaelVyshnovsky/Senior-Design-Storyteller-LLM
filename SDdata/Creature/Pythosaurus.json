        "mainbody": "The pythosaurus, more commonly known to locals as Esmelda or the Monster of the Lake, was a species of aquatic dinosaur endemic to Lake Esmel in Amn.\nThe body structure of a pythosaurus was largely similar to that of other aquatic dinosaurs, such as plesiosaurus and elasmosaurus, a large central body with a long neck and large flippers. However, their heads were notably said to resemble a cross between a snake and dragon, with an  tall rigid dorsal spine running along its neck. The description of the creatures body was fairly consistent in the stories told of it by the inhabitants of Amn, though there was often some form of inconsistency in the accounts.\nTheir central body was over  long and  wide, while their necks ranged from lengths of .\nBeing largely unintelligent animals, the pythosaurus was just as likely to attack boats as it was sailors and other creatures. However, unless hungry or provoked, they were unlikely to be found anywhere near the surface.\nthumb|280px|A silhouette of a pythosaurus passing underneath a pair of boaters on Lake Esmel.\nThe pythosaurus was a largely solitary creature, only interacting with other members of their species when they needed to mate or teach their youth how to hunt. This teaching period typically lasted for only a few weeks following the youths hatching, after which the creature would leave their offspring to fend for themselves.\nDue to their preference for cold water habitats, the pythosaurus generally stayed away from the western end of Lake Esmel and was more common in its eastern end.\nMost of the inhabitants of Amn believed that the pythosaurus was merely a myth and a tool for telling tall tales at taverns. They also believed that it was but a single creature, when it reality there were around a dozen living within Lake Esmel.\nThe pythosaurus was created by one of the creator races during the Days of Thunder (likely the sarrukhGiven the dinosaur nature of the pythosaur, the sauroid sarrukh were most likely responsible.). They had been in Lake Esmel ever since that time."
