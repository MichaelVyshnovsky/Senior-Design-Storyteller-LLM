        "Description": "Pixies resembled tiny elves, with reports placing them variously at {{SI|2.5|ft|long=yes}} to as little as {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in height. Pixies had silvery, moth-like wings and preferred to wear brightly colored clothing.",
        "Personality": "Pixies were mischievous sprites that enjoyed playing pranks on people. Such pranks included leading travelers astray and tricking misers into parting with their wealth.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|Pixies are well known as pranksters, but some delight in more helpful magic.{{Cite MTG|AFR|066|[[Pixie|Pixie Guide]]|[[Fariba Khamseh]]}}}}\n\nPixies had a number of innate magical abilities, such as being naturally invisible. At will, they could replicate the spells ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', and ''[[ESP]]''. Once per day, they could turn invisible for as long as they desired, cause [[confusion]] at a touch, and create an illusion with both visual and audible components; this illusion would remain until dispelled. Some pixies could replicate the spell ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]'' once a day.\n\nIn combat, pixies wielded appropriately sized swords and bows. Their arrows were sometimes drugged with a potion that caused complete memory loss.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Pixies were active at nighttime. They were herbivorous, eating fruit and nectar.",
            "Homelands": "Pixies tended to live in temperate forest regions, making their villages in deep forest caves.\n\nIn [[North Faerûn]], they inhabited the woods of [[Cormanthyr]]. In [[Northwest Faerûn]], they inhabited the [[Laughing Hollow]]. \n\nBeyond [[Faerûn]], pixies inhabited caves deep in the forests of [[Evermeet]]. On the [[Moonshae Isles]] they could be found in many of its deciduous and coniferous forests, in particular the [[Myrloch Vale]], as well as the kingdom of [[Sarifal]] and [[Llyrath Forest]] on [[Gwynneth]] Isle.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|60, 65}}\n\nIn the [[Unapproachable East]], pixies could be found around the woodlands of [[Aglarond]].

            "Religion": "The pixies that inhabited Evermeet were known to worship [[Titania]], [[Oberon]], and other members of the [[Seelie Court]].",
            "Usage": "Crushed pixie wings made pixie dust, also called ''[[dust of disappearance]]''. The creation of this dust was, naturally, frowned upon by pixies."
