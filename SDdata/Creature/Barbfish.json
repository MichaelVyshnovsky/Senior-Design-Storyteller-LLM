        "mainbody": "barbfish was a species of edible mud sharks that inhabited lower reaches of the River Specie in Amn.\nThe species name was inspired by the fleshy barbs that grew on the sides of the fishes mouths. Their skin was mud-colored, tough, and covered in a constantly secreting foul rot-smelling slime. These creatures could grow to be as large a horse.\nBarbfish used their fleshy namesake spurs to feel through riverbed mud and into otherwise inaccessible clefts while scavenging for food. They were a lethargic and lazy species that spent most of their lives slowly gliding along the river bottom and feeding.\nDespite living in river muck, these fish were known for their great taste. Barbfish flesh was eaten raw, fried, or poached in milk and butter. The skin was extremely unappealing and was always discarded. According to Volothamp Geddarm, barbfish was especially delectable when boiled with currants and berries."
