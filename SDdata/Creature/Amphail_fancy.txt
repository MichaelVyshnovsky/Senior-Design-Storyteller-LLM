The Amphail fancy were a regal breed of riding horses, exclusively bred by the renowned horse breeders of the village of Amphail, in the 15 century DR. They were popular among nobility across the Sword Coast North.
These horses had light brown coats, with a white stripe down their face and black manes that were typically braided.
