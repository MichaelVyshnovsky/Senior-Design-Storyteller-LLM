        "mainbody": "'''Giant ravens''' were a species of very large [[raven]]s.",
        "Description": "Giant ravens resembled common ravens save for their size; they typically had a wingspan of {{SIrange|6|10|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "Giant ravens were particularly clever creatures, far smarter than their smaller cousins. Some were known to be capable of speaking as many as a hundred words in [[Common]] and communicate with meaningful phrases.\n\nHowever, these creatures were also well known to be pugnacious and mischievous trouble-makers. Domesticated ravens were prone to thievery and often played practical jokes on their handlers. They also had a fondness for glittering and shiny objects.",
        "Combat": "While they only attacked other creatures while under duress, giant ravens pestered their foes with hit-and-run maneuvers made while in flight.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diets": "Much like their smaller cousins, giant ravens were an omnivorous species and obtained most of their food through scavenging.",
            "Habitats": "Giant ravens were known to be found all throughout [[Northwest Faerûn|northwestern Faerûn]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], they could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]<ref> and on [[Yggdrasil]].<ref>",
            "Relationships": "[[File:GiantRaven FB.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''A giant raven in the [[Frostfell]] alongside a rider.'']]\nThese creatures were considered very easy to train, at least if raised from a hatchling. Combined with their combative nature, this led many people to utilize them as guards or messengers."
        },
        "History": "Throughout their history, the [[Black Raven tribe]] of the [[Uthgardt]] reared the birds whose name they adopted as their own. They cared for the ravens from the time they hatched until they could be ridden as aerial steeds.\n\nBlack raven eggs and hatchlings fetched steep prices. As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, eggs could be sold for as much as 1,500 [[gp]] while newborn chicks commanded upwards of 3,000 gp.",
        "Trivia": "The [[wolveraven]], a successful form of [[duhlarkin]], was made by mixing a giant raven with a [[wolverine]].<ref>"
