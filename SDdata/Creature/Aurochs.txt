'''Aurochs''' were powerful wild beasts sometimes revered and used as war mounts by some [[orc]] tribes, in particular those that worshiped [[Bahgtru]].

==Rumors & Legends==
It was told in legends that [[Bahgtru]] tamed an aurochs with his bare hands and brought it to [[Nishrek]] under [[Gruumsh]]'s rule. He named it [[Kazaht]] (the [[Orc language|Orc]] word for [[bull]]) and rode it into combat, occasionally leaping over its head to land upon his enemies.
