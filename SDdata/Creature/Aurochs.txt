Aurochs were powerful wild beasts sometimes revered and used as war mounts by some orc tribes, in particular those that worshiped Bahgtru.
It was told in legends that Bahgtru tamed an aurochs with his bare hands and brought it to Nishrek under Gruumshs rule. He named it Kazaht (the Orc word for bull) and rode it into combat, occasionally leaping over its head to land upon his enemies.
