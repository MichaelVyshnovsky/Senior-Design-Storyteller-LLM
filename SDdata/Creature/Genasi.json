        "Subraces": "Each of the four fundamental elements had associated genies, so the most common genasi were [[air genasi]], [[earth genasi]], [[fire genasi]], and [[water genasi]],{{Cite dragon/297/Children of the Cosmos|64}}\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], when the separate elemental planes coalesced into the [[Elemental Chaos]], each genasi gained the potential to manifest the power of any of the elements, though only one at a time. After the [[Second Sundering]], the genasi were again separated into the four major subraces of air, earth, fire, and water.",
        "Description": {
            "Szuldar": "[[File:Watersoul genasi - William O'Connor.jpg|thumb|right|''A genasi manifesting as a watersoul, with clear blue ''szuldar'' on the face.'']]\nGenasi of the era between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering bore a unique physical feature not reported in earlier generations. Regardless of their elemental manifestation, the body of each such genasi was etched with strange lines of energy, called ''szuldar'' in [[Primordial (language)|Primordial]],{{Cite dragon/367/Ecology of the Genasi|13-14}} that glowed in a color associated with the element that the genasi was currently manifesting. The earthsoul manifestation had golden-colored energy lines; the firesoul manifestation had fiery orange lines; the stormsoul manifestation had silvery lines; the watersoul had bright blue lines; and the windsoul light blue. These lines appeared in a pattern that was passed along family lines, sometimes extending into small communities as well. Though the patterns could be similar between relatives in a general sense, the specific configurations were unique to each individual and served much the same purpose that fingerprints did amongst humans; the pattern of these lines remained unchanged even when a genasi changed their manifestation. Many genasi, especially adventurers, displayed these lines with pride, often wearing clothing that left a fair amount of skin exposed.\n\nThough ''szuldar'' usually remain unchanged throughout a genasi's life it was possible to alter them through scarring. Some genasi did this deliberately for aesthetic reasons, or in order to disguise themselves. Most genasi, however, disapproved of the practice and saw it as a loss of self-awareness, valuing the patterns they were born with as a mark of their identity."

        "Abilities": "[[File:Elemental tempest 4e.jpg|thumb|250px|''An [[elemental tempest]].'']]\nAll genasi had inherent magical powers and resistances related to their element.\n\nDuring the era after the Spellplague, a rare few genasi could control two elemental manifestations simultaneously. These powerful entities were known as [[elemental tempest]]s.\n\nLike other planetouched, because of the strength of their elemental heritage, many spells that specifically affected [[humanoid]]s had no effect on genasi. On the other hand, some spells that affected [[outsider]]s ''were'' effective against them, such as ''[[banishment]]''.{{Cite dragon/293/The Elemental Planetouched: Using Genasi in Your Campaign|56-57}}",
        "Personality": "Unlike many planetouched races, genasi generally took pride in their unusual features. In return, the genasi were perhaps the most distrusted of the planetouched races for being the most alien.\n\nThe personality of the typical genasi reflected her or his core element. For example, a fire genasi might have a \"hot temper\" and an earth genasi might take life slowly and carefully.{{Cite dragon/367/Ecology of the Genasi|15-16}}\n\nMany genasi philosophers believed that their race existed as a compromise between the chaos of the [[primordial]]s and the divinely crafted world of the [[god]]s. A few genasi took this to heart and tried to eliminate one or the other aspect of their nature, either becoming agents of chaos or disciples of order, but these individuals were considered the exception rather than the rule. Most genasi were simply grateful for the innate connection to the elemental forces that shaped the world that they all shared.\n\nGenasi had a strong ability to adapt, perhaps only superseded by humans in this regard, and embraced change as an inevitability or even something to be relished. Even lawful genasi embraced this change, and genasi of all kinds valued the possibilities the future might bring, such as new allies or new opportunities. In many ways, genasi were the most flexible of races, less stubborn and more willing to accept new ideas for better or worse.\n\nOne of the traits found commonly amongst all genasi was a strong sense of ambition. All genasi had a desire to better themselves and advance their status, either through pursuit of power, the acquisition of friends, or other means. Nearly all genasi had dreams and aspirations and would pursue these goals throughout their life and though few genasi were truly patient, so strong were their passions for these goals that they would often continue to follow them even long after individuals of other races would have given up and moved on. Simply put, they felt that they had a destiny and a calling to leave a name for themselves.\n\nGenasi loved most forms of recreation, particularly competitive ones that allowed them to improve their standing amongst other races further. Most genasi preferred recreational activities that were active and physical, allowing them to release their impulses and wilder urges.{{Cite dragon/367/Ecology of the Genasi|20}}\n\nBecause of their chaotic and spontaneous nature, genasi were not predisposed towards team athletics and preferred sports that favored the individual. Genasi were particularly fond of gladiatorial sports, which allowed them to bask in the attention of others while simultaneously releasing pent-up passions.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Genasi spoke the languages of their native region.",
            "Magic": "Because of their elemental origins, genasi usually favored [[elemental magic]] over other forms of [[magic|the Art]], which they had a particular skill for given their natural elemental abilities.",
            "Religion": "After the Spellplague, the earthsouled worshiped many lords and gods and were not confined to just one.",
            "Art": "Genasi art was wild and exciting, similar to the race itself. Genasi preferred elaborate and bold designs, using bright and vibrant colors to express the wide range of emotions they felt. Sculptures were often explosive in appearance, resembling surges of power more than anything else. Even for relatively simple or functional items, the genasi poured care into giving it a flamboyant appearance, marking it with swirling patterns, gemstones, or elaborate carvings.{{Cite dragon/367/Ecology of the Genasi|19}}\n\nGenasi artisans often saw their craft as a means of obtaining prestige. These individuals desired nothing more than to be in high demand and so worked hard to please their customer base. For this reason, many genasi often substituted actual excellence for customization and individuality and while the average genasi swordsmith might not compare with his [[Dwarf|dwarven]] counterpart in terms of quality, the genasi would work much harder to tailor the blade to his or her customer's specific needs and wants. This could go so far as to make genasi-crafted items seem uncomfortable or unwieldy in the hands of those for whom they were not intended."
        },
        "Combat": "[[File:Swordmage.jpg|thumb|125px|right|''A \"stormsoul\" genasi [[swordmage]].'']]\nAs a rule, genasi favored training as [[fighter]]s.) or [[warlord]].",
        "Ecology": "The child of an elemental creature with a human was a [[half-elemental]]. The child of a half-elemental and a human was a genasi. The child of a genasi and a human might show planetouched traits or purely human ones. Thus, overtime, the elemental bloodline was diluted until it was no longer obvious in most individuals. However, every few generations, a child might display his or her elemental heritage as a genasi.\n\nIf two genasi of the same element were to produce offspring, the child was always a genasi of that element; if the couple was of differing elements, the child would take after only one of the parents. However, both elements were still present in the child's blood and might manifest in future generations.\n\nPara-genasi came about when a half-elemental of one type mated with an elemental creature of another type.\n\nThe genealogy of an individual genasi was extremely difficult to determine, as the elemental planes had many sentient lifeforms capable of interbreeding with humans. Moreover, most such races would never admit to such a coupling and would reject both the half-elemental offspring and any of his or her descendants.\n[[File:Genasi teenager.png|thumb|left|250px|''A young genasi painfully gaining a second elemental manifestation.'']]\nEven after the Spellplague, a genasi child came into the world with only one elemental manifestation, the one passed on to him or her through the parents. By late adolescence or early adulthood, it was possible for genasi of this era to learn an additional manifestation. A few genasi were rumored to have learned several throughout their lives. Because the initial manifestation of a genasi was determined genetically, specific manifestations were most common in regions matching that element. For example, an underwater culture was not likely to produce many earthsoul genasi! Children reared in close contact with genasi of a different subrace were more likely to develop a second manifestation, as were those who were reared in areas where their manifestation's element was weak or nonexistent. Hence, a firesoul genasi raised in the middle of the ocean on an island was likely to develop a watersoul manifestation as well.\n\nThe initial development of a second manifestation could often be uncomfortable, even painful, and usually came suddenly and without warning. With practice, this transition became less discomforting, with those well-versed in the transformation experiencing little more than a mild and passing unease. The reason for this discomfort lay in the fact that the transition was more than aesthetic in nature and was actually a fundamental change in the physical makeup of the genasi, like replacing the sand in a bag with water.\n\nGenasi possessed a lifespan comparable with that of humans, reaching 75 years on average barring accident or violence. However, like other planetouched, some genasi had life spans roughly 20 to 40 years longer than normal humans.",
        "History": "Calimshan had an historically higher population of air and fire genasi, because of its history of djinni and efreeti rulers. When the ''[[Calimemnon Crystal]]'' shattered and the ancient foes [[Calim]] and [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] were released, so too were many of their genasi servants. The two [[noble genie]]s immediately began their epic war again, and the genasi took sides, joined by those genasi already living in Calimshan and even more from nearby lands of [[Tethyr]], [[Amn]], and the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]]. The Second Era of Skyfire ended suddenly in the [[1450 DR|Year of Holy Thunder, 1450 DR]], when Calim and Memnon mysteriously disappeared again to their home planes. At that point, the power vacuum was filled by the genasi, who ruled Calimshan and enslaved many humans under them, reigning from the cities of [[Calimport]] and [[Memnon]].\n\nAlso after the Spellplague, when Abeir and Toril were merged again for a time, the lands that were once [[Chondath]] became the realm of Akanûl, which was ruled by genasi originally from the continent of [[Shyr]]. The majority of the citizens of Akanûl had the windsoul and stormsoul manifestation.\n\nMembers of the [[Dominion of the Burned|Burned]], a group of Abeiran genasi, believed themselves to be direct descendants of original genasi crafted by the primordial [[Nehushta]] to be its slaves and that all other genasi \"tribes\" descended from theirs, but most other scholars refuted this local legend.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}}",
