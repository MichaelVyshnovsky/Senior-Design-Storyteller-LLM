A '''drakestone golem''' was a [[golem]] made of stone, with the lifeforce of a [[dragon]] instead of an [[elemental]].

==Description==
These were normally akin to statues of dragons, but their eyes glowed amber while active.

==Abilities==
Besides being able to attack with every part of its body, the drakestone golem had a [[petrifying]] [[breath weapon]]. They were immune to all [[spell]]s and all magic-based abilities, except for ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'', which slowed it down, and ''[[transmute mud to rock]]'', which instantly repaired it completely.

==Combat==
As a golem, they followed simple commands in battle. They generally opened combat with their breath weapon.

==Construction==
The drakestone golem's body was carved out of a stone block at least {{SI|3000|pounds|k|long=yes}} in weight, and required the spells ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[antimagic field]]'', and ''[[flesh to stone]]'' in its creation.

==History==
One of [[Sammaster]]'s guardians at the [[Capstone of the Rage]] was a drakestone golem.{{cite book/The Ruin|318-320|13}}
