A drakestone golem was a golem made of stone, with the lifeforce of a dragon instead of an elemental.
These were normally akin to statues of dragons, but their eyes glowed amber while active.
Besides being able to attack with every part of its body, the drakestone golem had a petrifying breath weapon. They were immune to all spells and all magic-based abilities, except for transmute rock to mud, which slowed it down, and transmute mud to rock, which instantly repaired it completely.
As a golem, they followed simple commands in battle. They generally opened combat with their breath weapon.
The drakestone golems body was carved out of a stone block at least  in weight, and required the spells geas/quest, antimagic field, and flesh to stone in its creation.
One of Sammasters guardians at the Capstone of the Rage was a drakestone golem.
