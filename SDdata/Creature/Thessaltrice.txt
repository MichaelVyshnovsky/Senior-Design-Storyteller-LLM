'''Thessaltrices''' were one of the four known [[thessalmonster]]s, a species of crossbred hybrid creatures. A thessaltrice was the result of crossbreeding a [[thessalhydra]] and a [[cockatrice]].
==Description==
The thessaltrice looked almost identical to a thessalhydra. It had a large reptillian body, a long tail that ended in a pair of sharp pincers, and a large central mouth instead of a head. Surrounding this mouth were eight serpentine heads. Unlike other thessalmonsters, the eight heads of a thessaltrice resembled that of a cockatrice, not a [[hydra]], and were covered in feathers. 

==Abilities==
Each of the thessaltrice's eight heads had the ability to petrify a target via physical contact. This petrifying ability was so powerful it extended into both the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] and [[Ethereal plane|Ethereal planes]]. If one of the heads was severed from the body, it regrew over a period of ten days.

==Combat==
Each of the serpentine heads acted independently and injected a poison with each bite. 

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Thessaltrices were found only in warm climates within jungles and swamps. They made their lair within caves.

Some were known to be found in the land of [[Chult]].
===Usage===
Juvenile thessaltrices were sometimes used as guards. Thessaltrice eggs were worth up to 5,000 [[gp]] and a live juvenile up to 10,000 gp.
