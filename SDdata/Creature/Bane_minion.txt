A Bane minion was a creature created by the deity Bane to serve his lieutenant, Gothmenes.
Bane minions came in three types black, blue, and red. In general, Bane minions were terrifying winged bipeds with upright locks and large tongues.
All types of these creatures could see invisible creatures, and they were immune to fear as well as the breath of dragons. They were not affected by death magic, confusion, oe poisons.
The combat abilities of Bane minions differed largely for each of the three types. Each type of minion was able to attack swiftly and utilize a deadly breath attack.
In the mid 14 century DR, Gothmenes, a powerful balor and the favored officer of Bane, planned to capture the goodly mage, Elminster. The Lord of Darkness created these gnarly beings to aid Gothemenes, and to populate his forces.
