'''Maw demons''', also known as '''abyssal maws''', In the Demonomicon of [[Iggwilv]], they were counted as a form of unintelligent, demonic wildlife.{{Cite dragon/359/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Apocrypha|45}}

==Description==
A maw demon resembled an enormous toothy mouth surrounded by a small plethora of stubby appendages.{{Cite adventurers league/Fire, Ash, and Ruin|8-10}} Their ugly hides were a shade of dull brown.

==Behavior==
Maw demons were dim and simple, only understanding two concepts; hunger and food. They were not driven by anger or bloodlust, but by gluttony, preferring to consume as opposed to fight. Unfortunately, they favored meat as fresh as possible, desiring living flesh rather than something already dead, but if a fight would be too difficult, they would subsist on the next best meal. Prey that was already bloodied was even more likely to send them into a ravenous frenzy. 

==Abilities/Combat==
The rending teeth of maw demons could do devastating damage to their victims, especially those that fell underneath them. Their appetite was so strong they could consume [[horse]]-sized creatures in under a minute. Lacking ranged attacks, their strategy rarely went beyond attacking the nearest foe with a preference for those that were already lying prone.

==Society==
Evil armies often used maw demons as shock troops, having them rush into the thick of combat straight away.  They were incapable of forming true alliances with other beings due to their dull brains, only serving other demons and spellcasters when forced.

Abyssal maws were usually summoned by [[gnoll]] war bands through freshly made flesh sacrifices to partake in the destruction they brought. Maw demons present in a gnoll war band attacked anything the gnolls came across, but did not respond to commands or orders.

===Language===
Though maw demons could normally understand [[Abyssal]] (and perhaps [[Common]]), their lack of intelligence and overwhelming number of teeth made it practically impossible for them to actually speak, normally resulting in unclear noises.

==Ecology==
The hunger of maw demons was infamously bottomless, for the living mouths were literally maws of the Abyss. After they rested for about eight hours, anything that a maw demon had devoured would be transported directly to the Abyss for further "digestion". In some cases, their meals were sent directly to Yeenoghu's gullet.

===Subraces===
Although greater maw demons existed, these stronger, bulkier variants had nothing in the way of more developed brains. 

==History==
A small group of maw demons served under a [[hezrou]] in the [[Land of Ash and Smoke]] within an abyssal void called the pit of [[Krahharu]]. They constantly stripped pieces of meat from the sacrifices made by the [[firenewt]]s above them and brought the pieces to their master, albeit after stealing small pieces for themselves.
