        "Description": "Dinosaurs came in many shapes and sizes, though, as the name \"behemoth\" implied, the best known were typically very large. They could be either herbivorous or carnivorous, depending on the species. Unlike dragons, dinosaurs were incapable of speech and were non-intelligent by nature.\n\nDinosaurs came in many varieties, from small to large, but most shared a number of physical features. They were, for instance, all covered in a layer of pebble-like skin. Most also demonstrated a well-developed sense of smell, which predatory behemoths used to hunt.  Many were also herbivorous.",
        "Behavior": "[[File:Dino chult.png|thumb|''Dinosaurs were one of Chult's dangers.'']]\nLike dragons, predatory dinosaurs had a powerful lust to hunt, their razor-sharp teeth suitable for rending prey apart and were also highly territorial. Herbivorous dinosaurs were usually less aggressive, although, when defending their young or wounded or after being startled or irritated, they could be vicious enemies.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Dinosaurs often lived in areas very much isolated from humanoid habitation. They usually were found in remote mountain valleys, isolated rocky plateaus, dense tropical island forests, or secluded in the deepest and darkest of the jungles.",
            "Location": "Dinosaurs were known to exist on Toril in [[Chult]] and [[Malatra]].{{Cite living jungle/Living Jungle Campaign: Player Information Guide|2}} They could also be found on the island of [[Lurath]], by way of time portals into Toril's distant past.<ref>"

        "History": {
            "Gallery": "[[File:Underdark 2650 3.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''[[Troglodyte]]s and their pet behemoth.'']]\n\nIt was widely believed by scholars from [[Candlekeep]] that dinosaurs existed in Toril since before the time period known as the [[Days of Thunder]]. In those ancients times, various species of dinosaur thrived until a cataclysm changed the world so drastically that most of them went extinct.\n\nSages from Candlekeep didn't have a unified theory about the nature of the catastrophe. The most commonly accepted theory proclaimed this catastrophe was the [[Tearfall]], while detractors of this theory believed that the [[The sun|sun]] temperatures diminished to a degree that produced a global climatic change so harsh that only the smallest dinosaurs were able to survive. A lunatic sage even proclaimed the cataclysm was actually a [[Dawn War|war]] between the gods and their enemies.\n\nWhatever the truth, only a handful of dinosaurs, among them the [[proto-dragon]]s, were able to survive and evolve into the members of the species that existed in the [[Era of Upheaval|present age]]."
