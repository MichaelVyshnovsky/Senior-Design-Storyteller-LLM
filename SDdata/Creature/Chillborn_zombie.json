They were heedless of their own safety as they obeyed the will of their creator, and would attack their targets in straightforward charges,{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Woolmen's Restless Tomb|9-10}} targeting weaker victims first.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Night I Called the Undead Out|9}}\n\nThey were generally disorganized and unintelligent,{{Cite organized play/LFR/At the Foot of the Lighthouse|16}}",
