'''Thessalhydras''' were one of the four known [[thessalmonster]]s, a species of crossbred hybrid creatures.
==Description==
Thessalhydras were hideous and terrifying creatures. They had a large, reptilian body with a long tail, {{SI|18|ft|long=yes}} in length, which ended in a pair of large, sharp pincers. It had no head, instead eight hydra-like heads, each about {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in length, surrounded a gaping mouth filled with teeth and acidic saliva.

==Abilities==
Thessalhydras had a natural immunity to all known acids and poisons with acidic effects. If one of its heads was severed, it grew back over a twelve day period. Once per day, it could spit a large amount of acid at a target, covering an area of {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} with a range of up to {{SI|30|yd|long=yes}}.
==Combat==
A thessalhydra made for a formidable opponent in battle. Each of its eight heads attacked independently, each bite delivering a potent poison. It used the pincer on the end of it's tail to grab a target, lifting and dragging the unfortunate creature into its mouth.
==Ecology==
Thessalhydras were voracious carnivores. They would not hesitate to kill and eat another of their kind.
===Habitats===
Thessalhydras were typically found in jungles, swamps, or underground locations. 

In [[Northwest Faerûn]], some were known to dwell within the [[Mere of Dead Men]].{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, "the Black Death"|53}} Beyond [[Faerûn]], some were known to be found in the land of [[Chult]].
===Usage===
Juvenile thessalhydras were sometimes used as guards. They were not trained, attacking anyone who approached them. Thessalhydra eggs were worth up to 7,500 [[gp]] and a live juvenile up to 12,000 gp.
