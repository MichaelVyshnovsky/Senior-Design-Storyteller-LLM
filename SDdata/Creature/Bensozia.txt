'''Bensozia''', the Queen of Hell, was an [[archdevil]] and consort of [[Asmodeus]].

==Description==
Bensozia was a tall, humanoid she-[[devil]] with long white hair and large, glistening black eyes. She had scarlet skin, brown hooves in place of feet, and a forked tail. She typically wore loose black robes lined with scarlet silk and a [[ruby]]-crusted [[gold]] diadem.

==Personality==
Bensozia was utterly loyal to her lord Asmodeus, and seemed happy in her position. Her natural demeanor was haughty and coldly polite.

==Abilities==
As the Queen of the Nine Hells, Bensozia was the most powerful of the various archdevil consorts. She could naturally cast ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[identify]]'', ''[[sending]]'' (but only to Asmodeus), and ''[[teleport]]''. Twice per day she could use ''[[finger of death]]''.

==History==
Bensozia was the consort of Asmodeus and the mother of [[Glasya]]. However, at some point in the history of the Nine Hells, the archfiend [[Levistus]] approached her. In some accounts he attempted to ravish her, while in others he tried to turn her against Asmodeus and was rebuffed. All accounts, however, agree that Levistus killed her and that that event was the cause of the archdevil's imprisonment.<ref>
