Gila monsters were a species of venomous and slow-moving lizard that could be found in the Plain of Standing Stones. They were counted among the most dangerous lizards that could be encountered in that region of the Anauroch desert.
These small lizards had large heads with powerful jaws and around thirty-five grooved teeth. Their bodies measured  in length, with diminutive legs and short, stout tails. The scales of a gila monster were brightly colored and rough in texture, almost bead-like, forming gaudy patterns that never overlapped. They were noted by some as resembling muckdwellers, though moving in a quadrupedal manner instead of bipedally.
Gila monsters generally had shy dispositions and wouldnt attack humanoids unless they were provoked.
These lizards had a sack of venom within their mouths that flowed down their teeth when biting down on prey. This venom would inflict extreme pain upon a victim, followed by sweating, vomiting, swelling, and an unbearable ringing sound within the ears. These symptoms would gradually worsen until the victim fell to their death.
When engaging other creatures in combat, gila monsters fought by clamping down with their powerful jaws and administering lethal doses of their venom.
Gila monsters lived solitary, nocturnal lives. They took shelter beneath rocks and within small burrows that they took over from other creatures.
Gila monsters had a largely carnivorous diet, consisting of small mammals, birds, and eggs. They could go without eating for a period of months, subsisting solely upon stores of fat within their tails.
