'''Septons''' were the fourth-lowest rank of hierarch [[modron]]s.

==Description==
Septons looked humanoid, with a large head. On one side of its head was a face, with two eyes, nose and mouth. The head was hairless and was supported by a collar of sorts that encircled it's shoulder area. Around this collar were seven evenly spaced small arms.

==Combat==
If forced into combat, an septon used a combination of innate abilities, spells and their sharp claws.

==Abilities==
Like all hierarch modrons, septons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Septons were able to cast [[arcane]] spells as well as [[divine]] spells from the [[Law domain|Law]], [[Protection domain|Protection]] and [[War domain|War]] domains. Septons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.

==Society==
There were precisely 49 septons in modron society. They acted as officials who maintained order and saw to it that all regulations were obeyed. One served each [[quinton]], four served each [[secundus]], and eight served [[Primus]] directly. They traveled from place to place as inspectors and examiners of work and records, and were charged with transferal of information from outlying areas to the towers of the regions, quarters, and the capital tower itself.  

==Ecology==
Septons were able to float through water with ease. Locomotion was provided by forcing water through its collar-like shoulder ring. They were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within {{SI|190|mi|k}} and could see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}. In addition to the normal senses of a humanoid, they had two additional senses that had the same effects of the ''[[detect magic]]'' and ''[[detect thoughts]]'' spells.
