Thessalgorgons were one of the four known thessalmonsters, a species of crossbred hybrid creatures. A thessalgorgon was the result of crossbreeding a thessalhydra and a gorgon.
A thessalgorgon had a large, reptilian body covered in strong scales. It had a long tail that ended in a pair of large, sharp pincers. Its head was that of a bull, surrounded by a ring of eight hydra-like heads. The upper half of its body was covered in hair.
Thessalgorgons had a natural immunity to all known acids, as well as petrification effects and spells. It had a devastating breath weapon a cloud of petrifying gas up to  in length. If one of its heads was severed, it grew back over a twelve-day period.
Each of the serpentine heads acted independently and injected a poison with each bite.
Thessalgorgons were carnivores and made their lair in caves deep within the wild.
Some thessalgorgons were known to be found in the land of Chult.
Juvenile thessalgorgons were sometimes used as guards. Thessalgorgon eggs were worth up to 7,000 gp and a live juvenile up to 10,000 gp.
