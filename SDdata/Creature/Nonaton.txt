'''Nonatons''' were the second-lowest rank of hierarch [[modron]]s in the modron hierarchy.

==Description==
A nonatons body was shaped like a cylinder. A ring of nine tentacles circled its midriff, an equal distance from one another. Two stout legs provided locomotion. On each side of of the upper part of its body, it had two eyes and mouths on opposite sides.

==Combat==
If forced into combat, a nonaton used a combination of psionics, spells and their tentacles.

==Abilities==
Like all hierarch modrons, nonatons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Additionally, they were able to duplicate the effects of ''[[detect charm]]'', ''[[detect evil and good]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[slow]]'' and ''[[web]]'' spells at will. Once per day, a nonaton could cast ''[[power word, stun]]''. Nonatons were immune to effects and spells that influenced the mind and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.

==Society==
There were exactly 81 nonatons in modron society. They acted as captains and chief inspectors of the [[pentadrone]] police force. One served each sector, nine served the [[tertian]]s, and the remaining eight reported directly to [[Primus]] himself. Each nonaton had twelve pentadrone lieutenants, each of whom commanded twelve [[quadrone]] sergeants, who in turn  each commanded twelve [[tridrone]]s.

==Ecology==
Nonatons were able to see in all directions simultaneously, due to the placement of their two eyes. They were able to see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}. They could communicate to any sentient creature within {{SI|63|mi|k}} telepathically.
