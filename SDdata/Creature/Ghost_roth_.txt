Ghost rothé, also known as snow rothé or white rothé, were a variety of white rothé.
Like other rothé, ghost rothé had shaggy fur, but their coat was a striking white.
Ghost rothé were able to magically jump and cast silence on themselves. They usually did so to escape predators.
Ghost rothé could fight with both their teeth and horns. They were skittish and prone to stampeding, which could be quite dangerous for anyone in their path.
Ghost rothé were one of the favorite prey animals of remorhazes and polar bears.
Ghost rothé dwelt on the surface in cold lands.
