Like other rothé, ghost rothé had shaggy fur, but their coat was a striking white.

==Abilities==
Ghost rothé were able to magically jump and cast ''[[silence]]'' on themselves. They usually did so to escape predators.

==Combat==
Ghost rothé could fight with both their teeth and horns. They were skittish and prone to stampeding, which could be quite dangerous for anyone in their path.

==Ecology==
Ghost rothé were one of the favorite prey animals of [[remorhaz]]es and [[polar bear]]s.

==Locations==
Ghost rothé dwelt on the surface in cold lands.
