'''Aratons''', more commonly known as '''desert devils''', were [[devil]]s surrounded by an unending sandstorm.

==Description==
Aratons typically appeared as {{SIAdj|6|ft|long=yes|adj=tall}}, naked [[humanoid]]s around {{SI|190|lb|k|long=yes}}. Their forms seemed flayed and sand-blasted and constantly oozed blood, giving them an appearance that often saw them mistaken for [[undead]]. This was the result of the {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes|adj=wide}} radius halo of swirling, abrasive [[sand]] that surrounded them wherever they went; the howling of the sand heralded an araton's approach.

==Abilities==
Like most devils, aratons were impervious to [[fire]], and had some level of [[spell resistance]] and [[regeneration]], (powerful enough in their case to regrow lost limbs and even instantly re-attach them by holding them against their stump). In addition, the abrasive grit that surrounded them harmed any creature that went within it. They were not exempt from its effects, and in fact the only reason they were alive, if gruesomely wounded, was because of their constant regeneration.

==Combat==
Aratons typically fought by whirling their pair of [[scimitar]]s, each tinged red from the blood that oozed from their bodies.

==Society==
Native to the [[Nine Hells]], desert devils were solitary creatures to whom the wastes called.

===Language===
Aratons typically knew how to speak both [[Common]] and the [[Infernal language]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1375 DR]], aratons could be found wandering outside the ruins of [[Oreme]] in [[Anauroch]].
