Camptosaurus () was a species of dinosaurs.
Camptosaurs looked like iguanodons but were smaller. 
Camptosaurs were known for being particularly dumb.  
Camptosaurs were an easy target for predators. A herd of camptosaurs would not flee from a predator until one of them was killed. Their main defence was in the form of a stampede.
Archelons were herbivores and lived in herds.
