'''Camptosaurus''' ({{Pronounce|k√¶mp|to|SAR|us|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}}}) was a species of [[dinosaur]]s.
==Description==
Camptosaurs looked like [[iguanodon]]s but were smaller. 
==Behaviour==
Camptosaurs were known for being particularly dumb.  
==Combat==
Camptosaurs were an easy target for predators. A herd of camptosaurs would not flee from a predator until one of them was killed. Their main defence was in the form of a stampede.
==Biology==
Archelons were herbivores and lived in herds.
