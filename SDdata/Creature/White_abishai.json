        "mainbody": "White abishai were the lowest-ranking of the abishai devils \nThe stingers of white abishai froze those they struck, contributing to their bestial claws and fangs.\nWhite abishai were savage and reckless, attacking with their claws, if not with longswords or flails. They were fearless in battle and on the battlefield become incredibly dangerous.\nWhen Tiamat decided that a soul was worthy of serving her she transformed it through an agonizing process into a white abishai. White abishai reinforced the ranks of Tiamats legions with their fearless attitudes and combat prowess."
