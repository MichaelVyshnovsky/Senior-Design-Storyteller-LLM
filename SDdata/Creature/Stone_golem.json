        "mainbody": "'''Stone golems''' were constructed from a single piece of carefully chiseled stone. The most elegant stone golems were used as both guardians and art pieces in a magical building.",
        "Description": "These constructs were generally made with a bipedal, [[humanoid]] shape, but stylized to suit their creator. Appearing as merely beautiful statues until commanded by their master to move and act. They were almost never outfitted with any sort of weaponry or armor.\n\nThe average stone golem was about {{SI|9|ft}} tall and weighed approximately {{SI|2000|lbs.}}.",
        "Behavior": "Stone golems were emotionless constructs who could not be reasoned with, always dutifully obedient to whoever constructed them, and could be given simple commands. They could even be commanded to fall into a dormant state, then come to life and attack other creatures when hostile actions are detected.",
        "Abilities": "Like any golem, these constructs possessed an immunity to [[magic]] and could not be harmed by normal weaponry. Only weapons with an [[item enchantment|''enchantment of +2 or greater'']] were capable of harming them, though this could be bypassed by use of the spell ''[[flesh to stone]]''.\n\nBeing constructs made entirely of stone, these golems could be slowed down by the spell ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' and repaired by use of its counterpart ''[[transmute mud to rock]]''.\n\nThe strength of these golems was twice that of any [[flesh golem]]. Due to the [[spell]] being used in their construction, a stone golem was capable of casting ''[[slow]]'' at any creature within {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} of it.",
        "Combat": "Stone golems always fought with their brute strength and fists. They would never wield weapons, even if ordered to.",
        "Variants": {
            "Sogi-nora": "A rare variety of stone golems that could be found in the [[Hordelands]]. These golems were created by [[wu jen]] and given a mind of their own. They were adept at implementing martial arts maneuvers like throws during combat."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Creation": "In older ages the cost of materials needed to construct a stone golem was around 60,000 [[gp]], and the process took about two months. Skilled laborers, such as stone masons and [[dwarves]], were often hired to carve the golem from its single block of hard stone. Construction of these constructs could only be undertaken by [[magic-user]]s of a 16{{th}} level or higher and required use of the spells ''[[geas]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', ''slow'' and ''[[wish]]''. These spells could be cast by the user themselves or by means of an [[item enchantment|enchanted item]], such as a [[scroll]] or [[wand]].\n\nAlternatively, the construction of a stone golem could be undertaken by any individual that owned a ''[[manual of golems]]'' or the ''[[Tome of the Unicorn]]''.",
            "Usage": "Stone golems were typically used to guard locations or valuable items.\n\nThey were often used as divine agents of the gods [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], [[Geb]], [[Segojan Earthcaller]], and the [[Red Knight]]. Those that served the latter goddess had the form of chess pieces.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}"

        "Notable Stone Golems": "* A stone golem was constructed to defend the tomb of [[Reinhar I]] that was uniquely shaped to resemble a [[lion]]."
