}}The '''Seven Wanderers''' were a special type of [[undead]] that roamed the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]]. Created from hideous water deprivation experiments by the [[House of Dhi'b]], the wanderers were terrible abominations.

==Description==
The Wanderers looked like human corpses that had crimson eyes and tough leathery gray skin. They wore shredded ''[[aba]]s'' and carried weathered [[scimitar]]s. They would also mutter incomprehensible phrases as they walked.

==Behavior==
The Seven Wanderers constantly roamed the High Desert in search of water, which they could sense from a mile away. Wanderers usually traveled at night. A wanderer would instantly travel toward the water once it was detected, attacking anything in its path. Once near the source of water, the wanderer would raise its arms high above its head and the water would instantly vanish.
