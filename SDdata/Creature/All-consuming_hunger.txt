An '''all-consuming hunger''' was an abhorrent and terrifying [[undead]].

==Description==
The all-consuming hunger was an absolute horror to behold. The creature was actually a swarm that was composed of rotting body parts and organs, all undead. It was always in motion and pulsated like a living heart.

==Behavior==
All-consuming hungers held an intense loathing for all living creatures. Their main desire was to kill the living.

==Abilities==
All-consuming hungers were immune to the effects of many types of spells. It did not feel fatigue or exhaustion and only the most devastating attack had an effect on it. It had the ability to see in darkvision with a range of {{SI|60|ft}}. A ''[[raise dead]]'' spell has no effect on it and the ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' spell only worked if its consent was given.

==Combat==
Creatures who encountered an all-consuming hunger were overcome with nausea. A smog of rotting death surrounded an all-consuming horror in a {{SI|60|ft}} radius. Any creature in this smog suffered the effects of a ''[[fear]]'' spell.

All-consuming hungers attacked by swarming their victims.

==History==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, one could occasionally encounter these undead within the [[Dungeon of the Crypt]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/127/Vampires of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Crypt|67}}

==Ecology==
If a creature was killed by an all-consuming hunger, their corpse became a entirely new and separate all-consuming hunger. This was due to the unique [[disease]] that every all-consuming hungers carried,  known as [[all-consuming wasting]], which furthermore could transform a living creature into an all-consuming hunger even if it survived the initial battle. This disease acted similar to [[mummy rot]], where the victim wasted away until they died. Healing spells such as ''[[remove disease]]'' prevented this wasting and cured the creature of the disease. If an all-consuming hunger was killed, a new all-consuming hunger rose from the remains after a period of time.
