        "mainbody": "'''Giant mason wasps''' were huge versions of a common mason-wasp. They could be found in [[Zakhara]] and were viewed as messengers of the [[Zakharan pantheon|gods]].",
        "Description": "Giant mason wasps had a jet-black exoskeletons and mandibles that glowed red with heat.",
        "Combat": "A bite from these creatures seared the flesh from because of the intense heat.\n\nA giant mason waspâ€™s stinger injected a dangerous toxin that caused the victim to pass out and fever. Unconsciousness lasted for a few days and the fever could kill. Those who survived were permanentely weakened from the toxin.\n\nAll kinds of fire was useless against these creatures. They could shoot a cone of fire from their mouths several times a day.\n\nKilling a giant mason wasp brought the ''[[evil eye]]'' upon the killer.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "In [[east Zakhara]], a colony of these wasps lived within the [[Mosque of the Sacred Fountain]] in [[Dihliz]]. These wasps were even taught to speak [[midani]] by the priests of [[Zann]] who also lived in the mosque.{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|20}} Also in east Zakhara, these wasps could be found in the [[Genies' Garden]].<ref>",
            "Relationships": "Giant mason wasps were friendly toward humans and [[demihuman]]s and even made excellent pets or guardians. [[Vishap]] were considered to be their natural enemies because of their penchant for eating wasp eggs.",
            "Usages": "Many parts of a giant mason wasp were useful for magical items, but killing one was bad luck so most waited for the insects to die naturally. A ''[[potion of fire breath]]'' could be made from their fire glands. Once powdered, their exoskeleton could be used for a ''[[potion of fire resistance]]'' or ''[[oil of fire invulnerability]]''. The venom from their stinger was used as a potent venom, but lost its effect after a week. It could also be used as a basis for antidotes."
