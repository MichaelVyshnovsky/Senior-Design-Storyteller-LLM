        "mainbody": "'''Gila monsters''' were a species of [[venom]]ous and slow-moving [[lizard]]{{Cite dragon/237/The Dragon's Bestiary: Venomous!|47}} that could be found in the [[Plain of Standing Stones]]. They were counted among the most dangerous lizards that could be encountered in that region of the [[Anauroch]] desert.<ref>",
        "Description": "These small lizards had large heads with powerful jaws and around thirty-five grooved teeth. Their bodies measured {{SIrange|2|3|in|c|long=yes}} in length, with diminutive legs and short, stout tails. The scales of a gila monster were brightly colored and rough in texture, almost bead-like, forming gaudy patterns that never overlapped. They were noted by some as resembling [[muckdweller]]s, though moving in a quadrupedal manner instead of bipedally.<ref>",
        "Behavior": "Gila monsters generally had shy dispositions and wouldn't attack [[humanoid]]s unless they were provoked.",
        "Abilities": "These lizards had a sack of venom within their mouths that flowed down their teeth when biting down on prey. This venom would inflict extreme pain upon a victim, followed by sweating, vomiting, swelling, and an unbearable ringing sound within the ears. These symptoms would gradually worsen until the victim fell to their death.",
        "Combat": "When engaging other creatures in combat, gila monsters fought by clamping down with their powerful jaws and administering lethal doses of their venom.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Gila monsters had a largely carnivorous diet, consisting of small mammals, birds, and [[egg]]s. They could go without eating for a period of months, subsisting solely upon stores of fat within their tails."
