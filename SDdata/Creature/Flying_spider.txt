Flying spiders were a rare species of large and subterranean spider found in the Realms.
The most distinguishing features of this species was that they had translucent, cobweb-like wings. Some would describe them as being similar to the wings of a dragonfly.
These creatures had a poisonous bite.
This species exhibited a low level of intelligence. This made them capable of being trained and of recognizing people by their gestures, smell, and voice.
In the mid-14 century DR, one could encounter these spiders within parts of Undermountain, such as within the Chapel of the Sericeous Sargh.
Flying spiders typically traveled in groups.
Many were known to train flying spiders to act as guardian animals, who would remain loyal so long as they were regularly fed. This practice was quite common and open in Skullport. One could find them secretly being used as such in many cities throughout Faer√ªn, such as in Calimshan and Waterdeep. In the latter city they secretly served inside of the villas of Waterdhavian nobility, in the strongrooms of merchants, and in the apartments of wizards.
