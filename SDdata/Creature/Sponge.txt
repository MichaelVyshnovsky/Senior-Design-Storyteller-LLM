When harvested and crushed repeatedly for a time, the skeleton of a sponge became exceptionally absorbent, able to retain a large amount of moisture that could be wrung out later. In this form, sponges were generally available in most towns and markets, including [[Aurora's Emporium]], which acquired them from farms in the [[Shining Sea]] off [[Tharsult]]. Sponges cultivated in the [[Sea of Swords]] were commonly found in use across the [[Western Heartlands]] and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].

The kingdom of [[Es'daan]] farmed sponges in great numbers, and the creatures were a staple food source in [[As'arem]] and [[Myth Nantar]].

[[Reef giant]]s were adept foragers of sponges, and were able to bring up whole hoards of them for trade.

Sponges were [[Material component|components]] for the spells ''[[Abi-Dalzim's horrid wilting]]'', ''[[numbing sphere]]'', ''[[wall of water]]'', and ''[[wildshield]]''. A dried sponge was also used in the creation of a ''[[potion of growth]]''.
