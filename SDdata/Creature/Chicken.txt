A '''chicken''' ({{Gender|f|hen}} {{Gender|m|rooster}}) was a domesticated, flightless bird that could be found in many places across [[Faer√ªn]]. 

==Description==
These small creatures were covered in feathers, and had small beaks. Chickens were valued not only for their flesh but also for the eggs they laid, and were considered a delicacy in many farms and cities. 

==Ecology==
===Usages===
* Inns such as the [[Watchful Eye (Espar)|Watchful Eye]] in [[Espar]] served chicken in pastries, and the [[Sleeping Cat]] in [[Wheloon]] served the meat in pies.
* In [[Neverwinter]], chicken liver was one of the many common fillings used in savory pies.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-11-25 - Neverwinter Cuisine}}
* One of the [[material component]]s for the ''[[cloak of fear]]'' [[spell]] was the tail feathers of a chicken or a [[vulture]].

==Trivia==
* [[Mage]]s could often (accidentally) transform themselves, or others, into chickens.
* One of the [[zulkir]]s of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], known as [[Merdrith]], could animate a magical hut that had large chicken legs.
