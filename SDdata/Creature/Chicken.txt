A chicken ( ) was a domesticated, flightless bird that could be found in many places across Faer√ªn. 
These small creatures were covered in feathers, and had small beaks. Chickens were valued not only for their flesh but also for the eggs they laid, and were considered a delicacy in many farms and cities. 
* Inns such as the Watchful Eye in Espar served chicken in pastries, and the Sleeping Cat in Wheloon served the meat in pies.
* In Neverwinter, chicken liver was one of the many common fillings used in savory pies.
* One of the material components for the cloak of fear spell was the tail feathers of a chicken or a vulture.
* Mages could often (accidentally) transform themselves, or others, into chickens.
* One of the zulkirs of the Red Wizards of Thay, known as Merdrith, could animate a magical hut that had large chicken legs.
