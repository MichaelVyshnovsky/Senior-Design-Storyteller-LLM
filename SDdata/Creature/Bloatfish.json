        "Description": "The bloatfish resembled a white [[manta ray]], featuring an inflated organ that protruded from its belly like a balloon. This organ's diameter matched or slightly exceeded the fish's length.",
        "Behavior": "The bloatfish displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "The bloatfish inhabited the rivers and seas of the [[Great Glacier]]. Bloatfish were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands."
