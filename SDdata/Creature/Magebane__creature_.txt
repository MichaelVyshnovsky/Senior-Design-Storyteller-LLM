'''Magebanes''' were small, flighted creatures who fed of [[magic]]al energies. They were infamous in [[Faerûn]] for harrying [[mage]]s and ruining their spellcasting, much to their chagrin.

==Description==
These creatures resembled [[bat]]s with somewhat amorphous bodies. They had long, barbed tails and ten spindly legs that extended from their underbellies.

==Abilities==
Magebanes could readily ''[[detect magic|detect magical auras]]'', which served them well when searching for their next meal. They were entirely ''[[invisibility|invisible]]'' and silent, except to any [[spellcaster]] they designated as their source.

They were immune to all forms of [[psionics]] and as such could not detect residual psionic energy.

==Behavior==
Magebanes fed on magical energy. They would designate a "chosen" arcane spellcaster to be their "source" of food. Whenever that individual cast a spell the magebane absorbed the energy in a manner similar to a ''[[rod of absorption]]''. These spells would either experience reduced effectiveness or fizzle out entirely.

They continued to follow their "chosen" mages until a more powerful source of magic made itself apparent.

==Combat==
Rather than using their magic-absorption method of feeding, magebanes utilized meager physical attacks in combat. They would slash at others with either their claws or pointed tails.

==Ecology==
In [[Faerûn]], magebanes could be found in underground areas such as caverns. They were also known to inhabit the plane of [[Pandemonium]] and possibly other [[outer planes]].

The flesh of these creatures, as well as a powder made from their claws, were highly valued as an [[alchemical]] reagent. An intact magebane carcass could sell for as much as 400 [[gp]].
