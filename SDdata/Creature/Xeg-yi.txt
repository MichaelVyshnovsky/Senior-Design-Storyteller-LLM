'''Xeg-yi''' ({{Pronounce|zeg|YEE|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}}) were a type of [[energon]] native to the [[Negative Energy plane]]. They were suffused with [[negative energy]] and were the dark and cold counterparts of the comparatively warm and bright [[xag-ya]].

==Description==
Xeg-yi were sometimes said to be the closest thing to an "[[elemental]]" of Negative Energy. They were intelligent and [[incorporeal]] concentrations of black, dull energy that took the form of faintly glowing, translucent spheres approximately {{SIrange|2|4|feet|long=yes}} in diameter. They had six to twelve tentacles radiating from this sphere, and atop the sphere were two narrow spots that looked like metallic eyes. The aura of a xeg-yi was cold and corrosive, and their mere touch could cause cell death or rot in materials such as [[cloth]], [[paper]], and [[wood]].

==Personality==
Xeg-yi were highly intelligent, having unknowable and alien minds. They did not speak or otherwise appear to be able to communicate&mdash;either among themselves or with others&mdash;however they would take notice of other creatures and often appeared to observe them. While often docile, they were sometimes observed to attack anything that they encountered in the Negative Energy Plane (although this was attributed to a form of curiosity rather than malice). They were known to explore the [[planes]] far and wide beyond their home plane&mdash;often alone&mdash;and seemed to be especially drawn to the phenomenon of death. As incorporeal creatures, they did not heed any physical barriers.

If befriended, a xeg-yi would fight to protect its allies. which could possibly create problems for spellcasters seeking to bind and use xeg-yi as guardians as well.

==Combat==
A xeg-yi's tentacles could deliver powerful jolts of negative energy that would rot and drain the life from anything they touched. While predominately a harmful and fearful power, they were known to use it to heal and empower [[undead]] allies. They could also suffuse the area around themselves in a {{SIAdj|60|foot}} radius to [[rebuke undead]] as needed, although undead generally just ignored them. Furthermore, xeg-yi were capable of firing short-range bolts of negative energy that could corrode materials like [[metal]] and stone, although they could not launch such attacks repeatedly.

If slain, a xeg-yi exploded in a burst of negative energy that was {{SIrange|20|40|feet|long=yes}} wide. They could only be injured by other incorporeal creatures or by [[magical]] weapons, and were known to be immune to a wide range of [[spell]]s: the only spells that could reliably be used to injure them included those which struck with magical [[fire]] as well as ''[[magic missile]]'' and ''[[disintegrate]]''. Their attacks could be defended against using ''[[shield]]'' and ''[[circle of protection]]'', or with a ''[[mace of disruption]]'' or ''[[rod of cancellation]]''. Additionally, they could be sent back to the Negative Energy Plane using ''[[abjure]]'', ''[[banishment]]'', ''[[dismissal]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', and/or ''[[wish]]'' (or ''[[limited wish]]'').

==Ecology==
Xeg-yi were perhaps the most common and well-known denizens of the Negative Energy Plane, and were immune to its oppressive life-draining and anti-life effects. Powerful spellcasters visiting the plane were sometimes known to recruit them as guides. and the [[Plane of Shadow]].{{Cite dragon/213/The Demiplane of Shadow|25}}

Even when they themselves were not hostile, xeg-yi were generally seen as threats by other creatures, owing to the fact that the energies comprising their bodies were inherently dangerous, Powerful [[incantatrix]]es were known to develop an immunity to the type of negative energies released by a xeg-yi.

Xeg-yi were understood to feed on many different types of energy.

==History==
[[Jergal]] counted xeg-yi among his servants, most notably while he was a [[god|greater power]] during the time of ancient [[Netheril]]. He became less interested in them (along with other forms of [[Life drain|life draining]] creatures) following the apotheosis of [[Kelemvor]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, xeg-yi could be encountered in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] and the [[Halls of the Beast-Tamers]].
