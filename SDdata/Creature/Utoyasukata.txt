Utoyasukata were a species of rare bird found in Kozakura.
Utoyasukatas were small birds with vibrant feathers.
Utoyasukatas used their blood as a weapon. While on a tree branch, theyd make a small puncture in the flesh with their beak and then shake themselves, which allowed for drops of their blood to fall onto a target below. They were vigilant and fled at the first sign of danger.
Utoyasukata were found in warm coastal regions of Kozakura.
The blood and meat of a utoyasukata was extremely poisonous. A drop of blood was enough to kill an adult human. The blood remained poisonous up to an hour after a utoyasukata was killed.
The meat was considered a prized delicacy among the elite in Kozakura. Merchants and nobles paid great sums to acquire it. It was a dish only the very wealthy could afford, since not only was it expensive to pay the hunters, the meal had to be prepared by a cook who was an expert in the preparation of utoyasukata. Since the meat remained poisonous long after the utoyasukata was killed, any mistakes during preparation or cooking could kill anyone who consumed the meat.
