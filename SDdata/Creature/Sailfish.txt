Sailfish were a variety of fast moving species of fish that all bore a resemblance to swordfish.
All species of sailfish shared a characteristic incredibly high swimming speed, long bill, and dorsal fin that often stretched the entire length of their back.
Trackless Sailfish A variety of sailfish native to the Trackless Sea. Unlike other species of sailfish, they were seen as far north as the Sea of Moving Ice, though in such waters their bodies moved at a slower rate than they were usually capable of.
Sailfish were typically found in warm bodies of water in the southern reaches of Faer√ªn.
In the kingdom of Koryo, these creatures were the namesake of the Sailfish Inn.
