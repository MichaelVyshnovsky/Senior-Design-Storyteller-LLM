        "mainbody": "'''Brownies''' were a small [[humanoid]] variety of [[fey]], distantly related to [[killmoulis]].",
        "Description": "Brownies were a short species, never more than {{SI|2|ft}} tall and weighing {{SI|6|lb|k}} or less. They had brown hair and bright blue eyes. Brownies favored garments that were brightly colored, made from either [[linen]] or wool, and often with [[gold]] ornamentation.",
        "Behavior": "These fey were known to be very peaceful, friendly, and almost never greedy. Though they suffered from a shy demeanor. They often held a fascination towards life on a farm.\n\nBecause of their good and honest nature, a brownie always felt obligated to do a good deed for the farmers they stole food from, such as [[milk]]ing a [[cow]]. Though in keeping with their penchant for remaining hidden, they would perform these good deeds in secret.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Biology": "These creatures had high senses that allowed them to always stay one step ahead of others, never being surprised."
        },
        "Combat": "The carrying of weapons was unusual among brownies, as they typically preferred to avoid combat. At most they were seen carrying [[short sword]]s. But even then, a brownie would not resort to using their blade unless they were cornered and unable to use their spells.",
        "Society": {
            "Diets": "Brownies were known to be vegetarians. They foraged for wild fruits and harvested small amounts of grain from the fields of unknowing farmers. Following any harvest they would gather grains, fruits, and vegetables that would otherwise go wasted.",
            "Lairs": "Brownies typically lived in the small burrows or abandoned buildings of rural and pastural areas. Occasionally they were known to covertly move into another creature's house or barn, though only if the inhabitants matched up to a brownie's high moral standards. These were referred to by many as '''house brownies.'''\n\nDue to their shy demeanor and the upholding of secrecy being highly valued as proper etiquette within their culture, a house brownie never revealed themselves to their landlords and only came out at night while they slept. During such hours a house brownie would perform a variety of household tasks. Such as making or repairing small items and clothing, spinning thread or yarn, baking [[bread]], and alerting them of intruders.\n\nThose who recognized the presence of a house brownie and understood how they operated would leave out small offerings of bread, fruit, and milk. Occasionally even [[currency|coins]] and [[gem]]s. However, those who were ignorant and boasted to others about having one in their home would deeply offend a brownie, driving them to move out.",
            "Homelands": "Outside of the [[Feywild]], brownies were known to be found in the northern reaches of [[Faerûn]] inhabiting the woods of [[Cormanthyr]] the [[High Forest]], occasionally the city of [[Waterdeep]], and the [[Llyrath Forest]] on [[Gwynneth]] Isle.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|65}}\n\nIn Faerûn's [[Lands of Intrigue]] they could be found in the [[Forest of Mir]] and [[Forest of Tethir]]. In [[the Vast]] they could be found in the forest of [[Dark Hollow]].{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part One|14}} In the [[Unapproachable East]], they could be found in the interior uplands of [[Aglarond]].<ref>\n\nOutside of Faerûn, a group of nomadic brownies were known to live in the [[Pasocada Basin]] in [[Maztica]], until eventually settling in the village of [[Kin Elbhaz]].",
            "Languages": "Brownies were known to speak the languages [[Common]], [[Elven]], [[Halfling language|Halfling]], and [[Sylvan]]. In addition, they were familiar with the languages of [[pixie]]s and [[sprite]]s.",
            "Relationships": "Brownies were generally known to be friendly towards [[human]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[elves]]. Domestic animals were also friendly towards them and would almost never attack nor alert their owner(s) of the brownie's presence. However, because of their shy demeanor they rarely interacted with such creatures, choosing instead to hide.\n\nBrownies were willing to help most [[lawful good]] individuals that asked for their assistance, as well as willing to guide most people if asked politely. Brownies were also known to steal treasure from evil monsters. They would sometimes purposely leave their horde of stolen and gifted treasure somewhere that a good individual was liable to find it.\n\nWhenever a stranger or outsider entered places that they inhabited, brownies would intently watch them and try to decipher their motives. If they determined that an individual meant harm to their local community, brownies would then work together to try driving them out.\n\nBrownies were one of the many fey races known to serve the [[Seldarine]]. Among [[Yondalla's Children]] they were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of the deities [[Arvoreen]], [[Brandobaris]], [[Cyrrollalee]], [[Sheela Peryroyl]], [[Urogalan]], and [[Yondalla]] herself."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some believed brownies were distant relative of the [[halfling]]. In particular, some speculated that they were the result of breeding between halflings and pixies. And in one or two versions of the halfling creation myth, it was said that the goddess [[Yondalla]] created the first halflings by transforming a saddened, solitary brownie.<ref>",
