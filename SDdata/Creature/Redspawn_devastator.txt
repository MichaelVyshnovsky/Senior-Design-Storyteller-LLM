Redspawn devastators were considered the most powerful species of dragonspawn.
Redspawn devastators were some  long, bestial creatures covered in bright crimson scales.
True to their name, they were highly destructive creatures, sometimes said to be fury incarnate.
Redspawn devastators were resistant to fire and heat, and began to spew flames from their mouths when badly injured.
Redspawn devastators attacked with their fangs, sometimes flinging opponents around.
Redspawn devastators were powerful, rivalling true dragons in might, but they were still little more than beasts. They were few in number. Devastators typically lived in remote areas, and their hunting grounds were littered with scorched bones.
