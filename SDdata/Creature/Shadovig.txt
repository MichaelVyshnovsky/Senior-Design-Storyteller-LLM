'''Shadovigs''' were minute [[fey]] that were thought to have been corrupted by the [[Shadow Weave]].

==Description==
Shadovigs resembled wingless, {{SIAdj|9|in|adj=tall}} [[pixie]]s. They had grey skin, clawed fingers, and veiled eyes. They typically wore black leather armor that appeared to be made entirely from belts and straps.

==Abilities==
Shadovigs were more dangerous in darkness than in light. All spoke the [[Common]] and [[Sylvan]] languages, and some learned [[Loross]] as well. Naturally, they had [[darkvision]].

Shadovigs had a few spell-like abilities, being able to replicate the effects of the spells ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[mirror image]]'' three times each day.

Shadovigs were good melee fighters, having poisonous claws. They were fond of sneak attacks when their opponents were caught off-guard. Additionally, they themselves were difficult to catch flat-footed, being able to react to attacks faster than their senses alone permitted.

However, shadovigs were more powerful and dangerous in the shadows. While in darkness, they were faster, harder to hit with attacks, more perceptive, more stealthy, and just generally more competent.

==Combat==
Shadovigs preferred to avoid direct combat, instead attacking from the shadows.

==Society==
Shadovigs were wicked creatures, said to have been [[sprite]]s that were corrupted by the power of the [[Shadow Weave]], possibly with the assistance of [[Mask]] or [[Shar]]. They were known to work as thieves, assassins, and spies, either as servants for others or masters themselves. Some shadovigs acted as [[familiar]]s to [[shade]] [[arcanist]]s.
