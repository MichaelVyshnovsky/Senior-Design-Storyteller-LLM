They were nearly exclusive to those realms in [[East Faerûn|the east]] and beyond within the [[Hordelands]].\n\nThese noble horses were bred for generations by the nations' aristocracy. While they were not well-known throughout foreign lands, Semphari steeds commanded a steep price in the range of 2,000 [[gp]].",
        "Description": "The beautiful steed had a light, lean-muscled body with long, slender legs. Their efficient builds granted them a significant amount of stamina. The manes and tails of the Semphari were quite long.\n\nSemphari were exceptionally sure-footed, graceful in their movement and quite intelligent in nature."
