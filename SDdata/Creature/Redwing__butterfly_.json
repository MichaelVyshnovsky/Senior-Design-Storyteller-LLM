        "mainbody": "edwings, also known as Morgans redwings, were a species of butterfly found within the High Moor.\nAs the name suggests, redwing butterflies had crimson wings with blood-red markings. They were considered among the most gentle and beautiful of the many species of butterflies found on the High Moor.\nRedwings were somewhat rare, although it was said that they had once been plentiful before being hunted almost to extinction by goblins for their wings, which they boiled to produce a red dye for their tribal art.\nThe name \"Morgans redwings\" was in recognition of a druid named Morgan, who was active on the High Moor at some point prior to the mid-to-late 14 century DR. According to the tale, Morgan saved the species from extinction at the hands of goblins after the tribes discovered how to use them to produce red dye. The druid spread false tales that the redwing dye was poisonous, and that it was the real cause of a disease that had struck the goblin population. The lie worked, and the redwings were left alone to recover their numbers."
