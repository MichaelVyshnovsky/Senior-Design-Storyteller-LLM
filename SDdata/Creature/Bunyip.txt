A bunyip was a large animal found in freshwater lakes and large rivers.
The bunyip resembled a cross between a shark and a seal. Instead of scales, it was covered in shaggy fur and had a mane of hair around the head.
The bunyip was a solitary animal. It was a very mischievous creature and would harass swimmers and small boats. It had telepathic abilities, and was able to detect the approach of humanoids from a distance. Despite its resemblance to a seal, it could not venture onto land. Bunyips were a nuisance to fishermen and trappers, as it was known to spring traps and steal bait.
The bunyip would use its sharp teeth and powerful jaws as its primary weapon. It rarely attacked large creatures, but would attack small humanoids. It could detect blood in the water and would go into a feeding frenzy, a frenzy so intense that its ability to defend itself would be compromised.
Mating occurred once a year, and was the only time the animal would swim into salt water. Gestation would last 3 months, and the parents separated when the young was born. A bunyip over the age of six would be able to mate.
A bunyip was a predatory animal, and would feed primarily on fish, other aquatic animals, and birds.
Beyond Faer√ªn, bunyips could be found within bodies of freshwater in Zakhara.
The bunyips hide could be used to make leather. Its flesh was edible but was oily and produced a strong odor. Due to the low-quality meat and the difficulty in capturing, it was generally not sought out by hunters or trappers.
