A plesiosaurus () was an aquatic carnivorous dinosaur.
Plesiosauruses had compact bodies and strong flippers that were used to swim. They had long and flexible necks that accounted for about a third of their length.
Plesiosauruses were aggressive predators. They attacked any creature that crossed their path. They were also highly curious and considered to be one of the smartest species of dinosaurs.
Plesiosaurs were commonly found in the depths of the Lake of Mists and some dwelled in the Methmere.
Beyond the Prime Material plane, some lived within the central lake of the Forbidden Plateau.
