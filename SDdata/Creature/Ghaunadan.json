        "mainbody": "'''Ghaunadans''' were intelligent [[ooze]]s that served the deity [[Ghaunadaur]].",
        "Description": "In their natural state, they were bright green, with a shape reminiscent of a drow. They could temporarily adopt the form of a stunning-looking drow, although its eyes would be of unfamiliar colors, such as pale green.-->",
        "Personality": "[[File:Ghaunadan2e.png|250px|left|]]\nGhaunadans were vile, intelligent, and charismatic individuals, and were devout servants of the evil god Ghaunadaur.",
        "Abilities": "Ghaunadans, in their ooze form, possessed [[blindsight]] and were malleable such that they could squeeze through very small spaces. They were naturally resistant to blunt force trauma in this form, and were immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, being stunned, and could not be polymorphed. Additionally, their natural pseudopods (which they could manifest in both forms) where covered with a paralytic slime.\n\nIn their humanoid form, ghaunadans could charm people simply by looking into their eyes, producing an effect similar to the ''[[friends]]'' spell that lasted as long as the ghaunadan remained in sight and in their humanoid form.",
        "Combat": "In their ooze form, ghaunadans typically attacked by forming two pseudopods out of their body to strike at foes and to coat them in [[Paralyzation|paralytic]] slime. Additionally, they could mold themselves around an enemy's weapon in order to take said weapon. They could also make pseudopods in their humanoid form, but typically chose not to break their cover, instead using weapons and armor that they found or charmed off of someone. Creatures who locked eyes with a humanoid ghaunadan risked being induced to feel strangely attracted to it.",
        "Society": "Ghaunadans resided alone or in small groups, living in any subterranean area where they could find prey, but most often dwelling near where their god's enemies&mdash;such as worshipers of [[Eilistraee]]&mdash;were active. They were active across the [[Underdark]], and preferred to live near other slimes and oozes, whom they would lead. Those of them who were active closer to the surface tended to learn [[Common]].",
        "History": "Several ghaunadans made their home in [[Undermountain]] beneath [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and it was rumored that some of them may have been active in the city itself in their humanoid guises.\n\n<!--",
        "Notable Ghaunadans": "They were subservient to [[Ghaunadaur]]; according to [[Cavatina Xarann]], they were bits and pieces of the god's mind."
