|A kraken dreams of casting its tentacles into the heavens and strangling that which birthed it, and when its dream exceeds its reach, it settles for the occasional passing ship.

==Description==
They were akin to squids except larger in size, with a body almost {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} long. They had a similar body, with a ring of tentacles surrounding a mouth connected to a conical central body. Two of its ten tentacles were longer than the rest and had deadly barbs. The kraken had very large eyes, and fins protruded from the upper part of its elongated central body.

When younger, krakens resembled a pale squid.

==Personality==
Krakens were highly destructive and evil creatures. With their strong tentacles and massive strength, they could pull an entire ship down into the ocean. They often completely wiped tropical islands of all life, and deep beneath the ocean, they had cavernous lairs where they bred [[human]] slaves to feed and tend them.

==Combat==
Krakens attacked predominantly with their tentacles. They could both constrict opponents and bring them into the reach of the creature's huge jaws. In addition, krakens could also release an enormous cloud of jet-black [[ink]], regenerate severed limbs, and even cast spells.

==Ecology==
[[File:Youngkraken.jpeg|thumb|250px|''A juvenile kraken.'']]
Krakens could speak some languages of surface-dwelling races but most commonly spoke [[Common]] and [[Aquan]].

In the area around [[Serôs]] krakens were known to be actively hunted by both [[storm giant]]s and [[merrow (ogre)|merrows]], keeping their population low.

==Notable Krakens==
* [[Gethshemeth]] was an ally to the [[morkoth]] Arcanum of Olleth that took control of an aberrant artifact called [[Dreamheart]] and became enthralled by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] in [[1396 DR]].
* [[Slarkrethel]] was an ancient kraken that ruled the [[Purple Rocks]], and headed the [[Kraken Society]] as their master.
* [[Xisar]], a powerful blue-skinned kraken that terrorized the land of Serôs in the late 13{{th}}-century DR.
