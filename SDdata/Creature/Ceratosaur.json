        "mainbody": "Ceratosaurs, or ceratosauruses (|audio=Ceratosaurus.ogg), also known as horned lizards, were vicious bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs from the jungles of Chult, also known as horn lizards of the Malatran Plateau.\nThese dinosaurs could reach 30 feet (nine meters) in length and walked on two thick, muscular legs. Their body and tail were proportionally large. They had a curved neck with a lizard-like head, which had a distinctive nose horn and brow ridges and knobby bumps above their over-sized eyes. Their arms were tiny with four clawed fingers each.\nCeratosaurs hunted either alone or in pairs. If in pairs, one would intentionally drive prey into the clutches of the other.\nCeratosaurs used their speed and powerful jaws to their advantage. If they caught a creature in their mouths, they would shake it violently.\nCeratosaurs, like most dinosaurs, originated in Chult.\nNo one had ever successfully tamed a ceratosaur.\nBeyond Chult,"
