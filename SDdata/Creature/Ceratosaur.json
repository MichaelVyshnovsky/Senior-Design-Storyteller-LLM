        "Description": "These dinosaurs could reach 30 feet (nine meters) in length and walked on two thick, muscular legs. Their body and tail were proportionally large. They had a curved neck with a lizard-like head, which had a distinctive nose horn and brow ridges and knobby bumps above their over-sized eyes. Their arms were tiny with four clawed fingers each.",
        "Behavior": "Ceratosaurs hunted either alone or in pairs. If in pairs, one would intentionally drive prey into the clutches of the other.",
        "Combat": "Ceratosaurs used their speed and powerful jaws to their advantage. If they caught a creature in their mouths, they would shake it violently.",
        "History": "Ceratosaurs, like most dinosaurs, originated in Chult.\n\nNo one had ever successfully tamed a ceratosaur.",
