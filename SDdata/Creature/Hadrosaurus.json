Their most distinguishable characteristic was their bone head crest.\nIf raised from a very young age (ideally immediately after hatching), hadrosaurs could be trained to work as a riding animal.\nIf threatened, a hadrosaurus could use its tail as a weapon.\n* Banana Candy, a well-trained racing hadrosaurus from Port Nyanzaru."
