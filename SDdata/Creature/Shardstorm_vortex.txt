Shardstorm vortexes were a type of elemental of air and earth that were native to the Elemental Chaos.
These elementals had swirling bodies of air, like a funnelcloud or whirlwind, with numerous green crystal shards.
These elementals were scavengers, feeding off the destruction left by more powerful elementals.
These elementals could only speak the Primordial language.
