        "mainbody": "The drowslayer was a unique, prototype construct created in the late 15 century DR by the elven wizard Etherik for the purpose of eliminating drow.\nThe drowslayers design was evocative of beholders, consisting of a large steel sphere with articulated eyestalks. But where as beholders had a large central eye, the center of this constructs spherical body was taken up by a large gaping jaw of sharp teeth that led into a flaming interior.\nThe drowslayers eyestalks could see in areas of total darkness and produce a telekinetic ray, much like that of beholders. Also like beholders, the drowslayer hovered above the ground.\nThe wizard Etherik held a deep hatred of drow, after having been the sole survivor of a massacre in the village of Silvershore around 1439 DR. Fourty years after that incident, he finalized his prototype for a construct that he hoped to mass produce to bring terror down upon the drow of the Underdark, starting with the city of Menzoberranzan. He prepared to show the prototype off to his peers to gain their support for its mass production, many of whom came to his manor by means of portals. But news of his creation quickly spread to Menzoberranzan, whose noble houses banded together and sent agents to eliminate both him and the drowslayer.\nWhile making their way through his manor, the drow came across his laboratory and the blueprints for the drowslayer within it. When the agents finally arrived to his lecture hall, they found Etherik both lecturing and performing experiments on drow prisoners before a live audience. Etherik quickly relished the change to test his prototype on the drow sent to kill him, proclaiming that he was hoping to perform a live demonstration. Meanwhile, the wizards attending the lecture stood by idly, only intervening with a magic missile when they felt threatened or thought Etherik was on the verge of losing."
