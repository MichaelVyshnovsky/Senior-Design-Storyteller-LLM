Weredragons were a group of lycanthropes that were able to transform at night from humans or sometimes other races into a humanoid form with characteristics of a species of dragon, 
They were not to be confused with the song dragons, a race of dragons who often voluntarily assumed female human shape, sometimes mistakenly called weredragons by those who misunderstood their nature and because weredragons were very rare as a population.
The hybrid form of a weredragon was humanoid in shape, but their skin transformed into reptilian scales, and they grew fangs and claws, a tail, and wings, all reminiscent of a specific species of dragon. Those able to truly assume the shape of a dragon also gained all the corresponding draconic powers.
Upon transformation into hybrid from, weredragons gained the ability to make dangerous bite and claw attacks. Frighteningly, they also attained a limited dragon breath of the type they resembled.
Lycanthropes were usually named after a type of animal and could transform into a hybrid form combining a human and that animal, as well as fully take on the shape of the animal. Weredragons differed from both expectations, instead resembling intelligent magical creatures and being reported to have only either a hybrid form not both.
Weredragons could be as varied as dragons themselves.
Weredragons were only reported after the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR. It is unknown if they existed before and were not discovered or if the upheavals of the Godswar created them. Drow-dragons, however, had already arisen from special circumstances in the years following 792 DR.
Powerful magic was one way to attain weredragonhood, either from magic items or through fusion of a dragon and a human in a freak turbulence of wild magic. Another proposed cause was, like for other lycanthropes, powerful curses. 
For individuals, if not deliberately brought about magically, the initial transformation could occur spontaneously when they were under great pressure.
