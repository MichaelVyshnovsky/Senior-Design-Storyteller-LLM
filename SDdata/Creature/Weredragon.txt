'''Weredragons''' were a group of [[lycanthrope]]s that were able to transform at night from [[human]]s or sometimes other races into a humanoid form with characteristics of a species of [[dragon]],{{Cite dragon/245/Wyrms of the North: Lhammaruntosz}} 

They were not to be confused with the [[song dragon]]s, a race of dragons who often voluntarily assumed female human shape, sometimes mistakenly called ''weredragons'' by those who misunderstood their nature and because weredragons were very rare as a population.<ref><ref>

==Description==
The hybrid form of a weredragon was humanoid in shape, but their skin transformed into reptilian scales, and they grew fangs and claws, a tail, and wings, all reminiscent of a specific species of dragon. Those able to truly assume the shape of a dragon also gained all the corresponding draconic powers.

==Abilities==
Upon transformation into hybrid from, weredragons gained the ability to make dangerous bite and claw attacks. Frighteningly, they also attained a limited [[dragon breath]] of the type they resembled.

==Classification and Special Cases==
Lycanthropes were usually named after a type of [[animal]] and could transform into a hybrid form combining a human and that animal, as well as fully take on the shape of the animal. Weredragons differed from both expectations, instead resembling intelligent magical creatures and being reported to have only either a hybrid form not both.

==Subspecies==
Weredragons could be as varied as dragons themselves.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}}

==History==
Weredragons were only reported after the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. It is unknown if they existed before and were not discovered or if the upheavals of the [[Godswar]] created them. Drow-dragons, however, had already arisen from special circumstances in the years following [[792 DR]].

Powerful magic was one way to attain weredragonhood, either from [[magic item]]s or through fusion of a dragon and a human in a freak turbulence of [[wild magic]]. Another proposed cause was, like for other lycanthropes, powerful curses. 

For individuals, if not deliberately brought about magically, the initial transformation could occur spontaneously when they were under great pressure.
