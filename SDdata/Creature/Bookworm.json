        "mainbody": "'''Bookworms''' were dangerous pests and the bane of librarians everywhere.",
        "Description": "Bookworms were tiny creatures, usually only measuring {{SI|1|in|c|length=yes}} in length. The base color of a bookworm's body at birth was white, but would develop into a dull gray shade due to their ingestion of [[ink]].",
        "Biology": "Bookworms were capable of blending in with their surroundings, similar to a [[chameleon]]. Their senses could smell any [[book]], [[spellbook]], [[map]], or [[scroll]] within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. Their jaws were capable of boring through wood and even leather if needed to reach their desired food. When fleeing from danger, they were capable of hopping {{SI|10|ft}} into the air.\n\nBookworms bred only once in their lifetime. When they did, typically on average a brood of 80 eggs was laid and the mating pair died shortly afterwards. Only half of the eggs within a brood would hatch the following month. Those newly hatched bookworms would die in less than half an hour if they did not obtain food.\n\nThe average life-span of a bookworm was two to three years. This was due in part to the ink from [[paper]] they ate building up in their system, eventually killing them.",
        "Combat": "These slight creatures avoided combat at all costs, using their speed to escape threats. But until attacked, a feeding bookworm would remain motionless.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Ravens Bluff]] resident [[Skully]] sometimes sought out and purchased bookworms. He secretly offered these for sale at his shop, [[Skully's Bar and Bait]], as highly priced fishing bait.{{Cite polyhedron/46/The Living City: Skully's Bar and Bait|17}}",
        "Reputation": "Bookworms were considered a serious danger by many temples, libraries, [[magic]] users, and government buildings.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diets": "Bookworms fed on paper and bindings. They were incapable of eating any other living material, including the ink that was so prevalent in among the things they ate.",
            "Habitats": "Bookworms inhabited libraries or any other place where a large volume of printed lore could be found. If a bookworm was discovered, then the chances were high that plenty more were feasting nearby.\n\nIn [[northwest Faerûn]], some inhabited the [[Ardeep Forest]].{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|8}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\">[[Dragon magazine 128|''Dragon'' #128]]'s article \"Welcome to Waterdeep\" states that [[Monster Manual II 1st edition|''Monster Manual II'']]'s \"cold, civilized forest\" table is representative of what can be found in Ardeep forest. In [[west Faerûn]] they could be found in [[Tethyr]], where they were of concern to the library [[Seirystrum]].<ref name=\"VGtBGII-p103>",
            "Relationships": "Some people were known to utilize the destructive potential of bookworms for their gain. Such as exacting revenge on a [[mage]] and destroying incriminating documents. However, it was difficult to keep bookworms alive in captivity and there was an ever-present danger that the creature might follow their captor home once released.\n\nBookworms were also known to be used as [[material component]]s in a variety [[spell]]s and alchemical recipes. In particular, residual ink from their bodies could be used in the creation of a scroll of ''[[protection from magic]]''."
