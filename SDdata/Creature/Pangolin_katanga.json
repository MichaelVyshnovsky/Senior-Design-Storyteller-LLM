        "mainbody": "'''Pangolin katanga''' were an uncommon race of [[katanga]] found in the lush jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/Malatra Monstrous Compendium Sheets|21-22}}",
        "Description": "Katanga were intelligent animal [[shapechanger]]s who could take on the shape of a beast as well as appear in a hybrid form. Pangolin katanga could transform into a wild [[pangolin]], a small tropical beast with natural armor. Just like the beasts, pangolin katanga had powerful prehensile tails allowing them to hang off tree branches with ease. Their hands and paws ended in long claws used for burrowing and climbing. Their tales were highly sensitive, similar to the fingers of humans, and they hads long tongues, almost as long as the creatures' bodies, which they used to catch insects.\n\nIn their [[human]] form, pangolin katanga retained some of the features of their animal form, making their race obvious. They appeared to be short [[Shou]] with tell-tale scale-like plates that covered the tops of their heads and ran down their necks and along their backs. In their bipedal hybrid form, they appeared to be a blend of a human and a pangolin, retaining the ability to use hands to manipulate objects, while the animal shape was that of a mundane pangolin.\n\nOne notable feature of all katanga, regardless of the form they took, was that the shadow they cast was always that of the animal.",
        "Abilities": "Just like normal pangolins, katanga could roll their bodies into a well-armored ball. While curled up, a pangolin katanga's shell was hard to penetrate; however, the increased defense came at the price of movement. In their uncurled state, pangolin katanga were surprisingly fast.\n\nDespite similarities with werebeasts, katanga were not [[lycanthrope]]s and did not share their strengths or vulnerabilities. When detected or examined via magic, all katanga appeared to be ordinary natural animals. In their animal form, pangolin katanga could only communicate with others of their kin and rendered themselves unable to use magic.\n\nKatanga could change their shape a limited number of times per day, depending on their experience and strength.",
        "Personality": "They were shy and skittish creatures. They preferred escape to direct confrontation, and pangolin katanga felt intimidated by bigger creatures.{{Cite living jungle/Inhabitants of the Jungle|9}} Pangolin katanga were a foraging society. They collected food on the ground and atop jungle trees. When threatened or tired, they scaled trees where pangolins rested or hid from many jungle predators.",
        "Combat": "When not rolling into a ball or retreating, animal-shape pangolins could spray their opponents with foul-smelling secretions three times per day.",
        "Society": {
            "Habitats": "Pangolin katanga inhabited the lush jungles and blistering savannas of the Malatran Plateau but rarely ventured into the Living Jungle's mountainous regions. They built their homes on the edge of the jungle and savanna. They lived underground in large burrowed lairs; each was inhabited by a family of four to eight pangolin katanga.",
            "Professions": "Like most other katanga, adventuring pangolins most often took on the art of [[warrior]]-craft, [[wizard]]ry, [[thief|thievery]], or a [[cleric]]'s mantle.{{Cite living jungle/Inhabitants of the Jungle|9}}"

        "History": "As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''[[seeming spell fetish]]es'' were crafted in the shape of a small pangolin katanga statuette.{{Cite organized play/LJ/The Necromancer's Stone|14}}",
        "Notable Pangolin Katanga": "*[[Baluu]], a male [[sorcerer]] pangolin katanga who joined the heroes of the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] against the malicious [[spider katanga]], [[Mother of a Thousand Young]], in the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|11}}\n*[[Menari]], an elderly pangolin katanga woman who aided those hurt by the earthquakes around the [[Kaltra]] village in the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Trembling Village|9}}"
