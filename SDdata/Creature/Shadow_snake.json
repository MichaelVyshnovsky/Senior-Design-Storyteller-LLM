        "mainbody": "Shadow snakes were large, venomous snakes that lived in the jungles of southern Faer√ªn. They may have had some connection to the Shadowfell. Yuan-ti were said to keep shadow snakes as pets.\nShadow snakes were twice as long as a human and had greyish-black skin that was shadowy in substance.\nShadow snakes were ambush predators that surprised prey by stepping through shadows. The bite of this venomous snake could turn a victims limb into a shadowy substance.\nShadow snakes were thought to have been the creation of the god Zehir. For this reason, they were greatly revered by the yuan-ti."
