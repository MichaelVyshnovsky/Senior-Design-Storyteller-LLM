Silverback was a species of fish that inhabited the Imnestream river in Amns Zehoarast Floodplains.
Silverback fish were abundant in Imnestreams cold rushing waters, where it was a common catch during fishing seasons. Along with bluefins, silverbacks were fished via nets or spears. Imnestreams narrow channels and plungepools were perfect for silverback fishing as the rivers rapid waters forced them into certain spots of calmer water.
