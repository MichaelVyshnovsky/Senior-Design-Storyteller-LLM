        "mainbody": "'''Eyedrakes''' were the result of a [[beholder]] dreaming of a [[dragon]].",
        "Description": "Eyedrakes vaguely resembled a draconic creature, but lacked true limbsâ€”the wings were formed of multiple eyestalks, and another large eye was located inside of the perpetually open mouth.",
        "Behavior": "Eyedrakes on their own exhibited behaviors similar to those of young dragons, such as establishing a lair and hoard. They fought to the death to defend their hoard, refusing to relinquish even the smallest bauble.",
        "Abilities": "Eyedrakes had the magic eye-rays of beholders: the eye in the mouth emitted the [[antimagic]] cone and the wing-eyestalks unleashed, variously, a freezing ray, a repulsion ray, a fire ray, a paralysis-inducing ray, and a necrotizing ray.",
        "Ecology": "Sometimes, when a beholder had to compete against a dragon for wealth or territory, it grew obsessed with its draconic rival to the point that its obsession pervaded its dreams; if the obsession lasted long enough, the fevered dreams lead to the creation of an eyedrake.\n\nBecause of their peculiar nature, eyedrakes required neither food nor drink."
