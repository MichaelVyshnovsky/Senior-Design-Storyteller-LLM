        "Description": "Mamenchisaurs were sauropods. Their massive body supported what is likely the longest neck of any natural creature found on [[Toril]]. Their neck is a full {{SI|35|ft}} in length. Their neck contains nineteen vertebrae, which were supported by bony connections. This prevented the mamenchisaurus from bending its neck other than their head.",
        "Combat": "When targeted by a predator, mamenchisaurs used their tails as a destructive whip.",
        "Habitat": "Mamenchisaurs were found living in swamps.",
        "Biology": "Mamenchisaurs were herbivores and solitary creatures. Their long neck allowed them to reach the foliage from any tree."
