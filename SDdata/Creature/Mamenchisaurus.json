Their neck is a full  in length. Their neck contains nineteen vertebrae, which were supported by bony connections. This prevented the mamenchisaurus from bending its neck other than their head. \nWhen targeted by a predator, mamenchisaurs used their tails as a destructive whip.  \nMamenchisaurs were found living in swamps. \nMamenchisaurs were herbivores and solitary creatures. Their long neck allowed them to reach the foliage from any tree."
