Such payment could take the standard form of wealth, but also in the form of knowledge, poetry, prose, riddles, or even the location of an androsphinx. Failure to pay them often led to the offending humans being eaten.\nGynosphinxes were favored monsters of the dwarven deities Dugmaren Brightmantle and Vergadain and the Mulhorandi goddess Isis, often acting as their divine servitors and being sent as messengers to their faithful.\n* Firaleene"
