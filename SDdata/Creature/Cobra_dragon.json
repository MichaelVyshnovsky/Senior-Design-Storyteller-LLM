        "mainbody": "Cobra dragons were a rare species found in Kara-Tur.\nCobra dragons were winged, serpentine reptiles that ranged in length from  as hatchlings, to as much as . They had glossy black scales on the back and sides, and bright orange scales on the underbelly. On the neck directly behind the head was a hood of skin akin to that of a king cobra.\nThese creatures rivaled Faer√ªnian dragons in greed and aggressiveness. The favorite hobby of cobra dragons was collecting skulls, with skulls of rare and mighty creatures being the most valued by these serpentine creatures. A cobra dragons favorite collectible skulls included those of cave bears, dinosaurs, dragons, giants, and unicorns, as they were some of the largest, rarest, and most powerful creatures. Humanoid skulls, meanwhile, might be considered interesting but were worth little as they could be gotten so easily. Gifting a skull, especially a rare skull, when speaking with a cobra dragon was very helpful in improving its disposition.\nAkin to other dragons, cobra dragons had an aura of fear and the ability to detect anything hidden or invisible around them.\nCobra dragons did not use magic like other dragons, and actually had a strong resistance to it. They were immune to their own breath weapons, as well as all other fire- and heat-based attacks, no matter whether the source of the heat-based attack was considered magical or mundane. However, they were vulnerable to ice- and cold-based attacks.\nThey relied on their natural capabilities to catch their targets. A cobra dragon fought using its claws, exceptionally dangerous venomous bite, and its long whip-like tail. When bitten, the victim quickly grew weak, dizzy, and frequently nauseous, making it impossible to drink or eat anything, and they would experience extensive internal bleeding. This carried on for ten minutes, after which the victim either recovered or grew worse, falling unconscious and in a state of shock, marked by pale skin and sweating. Death came five minutes later. The poison had to be cured with magic.\nThey possessed a breath weapon that consisted of a cone of fire that extended , with a  width at the end. Alternatively, a cobra dragon could breathe its fire below its own body, causing it to spread out in a ring of fire  wide, effectively like a wall of fire and burning all within except the cobra dragon. This was used defensively when surrounded by multiple hostile creatures, like in the context of an ambush.\nAfter breathing fire, the cobra dragon released a black smoke cloud from its nostrils, covering an area with a  radius around the dragon. Discounting the dragon, everyone caught inside the cloud was beset by coughing, nausea, and irritation of the eyes. A cloud lingered for four to sixteen minutes before dissipating, while strong drifts would only shift, not disperse, it. If multiple clouds overlapped, the negative effects of said clouds would multiply.\nMale and female cobra dragons had a mating ritual in spring in which they fought but did not wound one another, then consummated in a display described as \"fiery\". They did this only in young adulthood or adulthood, while older cobra dragons took pride in not mating and boasted that they had outgrown the mating drive. The female would usually lay up to four eggs about . The hatchlings stayed with the female until theyd achieved subadulthood.\nCobra dragons dwelt in tropical and subtropical climates and made their lairs underground in caves or caverns, while they had no liking for swamps. They lived in southern Kara-Tur, with some in the southernmost parts of Tu Lung, where they caused much destruction and misery, and were more common in the regions further south and west.\nAs many dragons did, a cobra dragon claimed a territory around its laid and viciously forced out every other creature and intruder. They only tolerated trespass from fellow cobra dragons, and only then in mating season.\nAdult cobra dragons could be served by small groups of intelligent but leaderless beings attracted by its power, charisma, and cunning and who even worshiped it as a god. Such followers typically included, but were not limited to, bakemono, gargoyles, lizardmen, and mobats. They were permitted to dwell with the cobra dragon in its territory. Some 60% of adult cobra dragons and older usually had around two to eight followers. These followers were usually heavily equipped to deal with the dragons enemies.\nIn certain legends, it was said that special king cobras who reached a great age would change into cobra dragons."
