An '''ox''' ({{Plural|oxen}}), also known as a '''bullock''', was a variety of cattle that was found on [[Toril]].

==Description==
An ox was capable of carrying much more cargo than other creatures of the same approximate size.

A unique species of red ox was domesticated and commonly used in the [[Utter East]], namely in the country of [[Doegan]]. As most horses died off of disease and the hot climate after the Utter East's colonization, the red ox proved to be a much more reliable beast of burden.

==Sub-Species==
;Red-backed river ox: a rare breed of oxen of a slightly smaller size, found in the [[Western Heartlands]] and [[Baldur's Gate]].
;[[Thimdror]]: a small, ugly breed of oxen that were favored for consumption over usage as beasts of burden.{{Cite dungeon/194/Eye on the Realms: Thormil's Secret|29}}
;Yoxen: otherwise known as ''yoke-oxen'', were a breed of oxen unique to the plains of [[Amn]]. Leather made from their hides was notably used to bound ''[[Bowgentle's Book]]''<ref><ref>{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|30}} and their hair was used to make wigs, which could be quite realistic.<ref>

==History==
In the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], oxen were one of many beasts of burden that could be found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Outer City|Outer City]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]], as such animals were outlawed from entering the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower]] and [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] districts.<ref>

In the [[Sword Coast]], oxen were used to drive pumps at [[Baldur's Gate]]'s docks and along the [[Trade Way]], [[The Way Inn]] regularly purchased and sold oxen among other domestic beasts of burden. In [[north Faer√ªn]], the usage and trade of oxen was quite common throughout [[the Dalelands]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/Deepingdale Politics}}

Some associated them with the [[orc pantheon|orc deity]] [[Bahgtru]], whose [[shaman]]s were often known to use them as [[mount]]s.
