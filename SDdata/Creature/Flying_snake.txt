'''Flying snakes''' were brightly colored, winged [[snake|serpents]] found in tropical locations and remote jungles such as [[Chult]].

==History==
During the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], flying snakes trained as messengers were popular with members of the [[Zhentarim]] and were sometimes recognized as symbols of the faction. 

In [[Port Nyanzaru]], the merchant prince [[Ifan Talro'a]] sold flying snakes exclusively to members of the Zhentarim.

==Ecology==

=== Usage ===
Flying snakes could sometimes be domesticated to serve as messengers that delivered scrolls wrapped in their coils.
===Habitats===
Besides Chult, flying snakes were known to inhabit the [[Wood of Dark Trees]].
===Relationships===
Flying snakes were often gifted by the deity [[Sseth]] to his [[wizard]] or [[priest]] worshipers as [[familiar]]s or [[animal companion]]s.
