        "mainbody": "'''Gloamings''' were a variety of [[planetouched]] creatures with heritage from both [[Toril]] and the [[Plane of Shadow]].",
        "Description": "Gloamings were humanoid in form, with dark-furred wings and pale, bioluminescent skin; they could control the brightness of their skin, changing between none at all, through levels of dimness, up to blindingly bright. Their eyes were grey, green-grey, blue-grey, or violet-grey in color, and often described as \"cat-like\" due to their oval pupils and ''[[wikipedia:en:Tapetum lucidum|tapetum lucidum]]'' (that is, the eyes reflect light). In dim light, the eyes appear metallic in color. The fine fur on a gloaming's wings could be black, dark brown, or dark grey. The wing fur was thick and had an especially notable gloss at the tips and at the base.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-02-05 - Gloaming Wings}}\n\nMost gloamings had one or more tattoos, which created differently-shaded or lit patterns on their luminescent skin. They ranged in height from {{SI|2'6|'\"}} to {{SI|3|ft}}, and weighed about {{SI|25|lb|k}}.",
        "Personality": "As a group, gloamings were curious and prided themselves on their individuality-or perhaps their contrariness, for the alignment of any given gloaming almost always was something other than the dominant alignment of the region they were in. For example, a chaotic evil gloaming would not be found in a chaotic evil settlement, but gloamings of most other alignments might be found there. And in a predominantly neutral region, the gloamings there will be of extreme alignments (the corners of the alignment grid).",
        "Abilities": "The gloaming race had several innate abilities, including their bioluminescent skin and [[low-light vision]], but they suffered light blindness in bright light. They could fly, with only average maneuverability. They also had a minor talent for shadow-based illusion spells; they were also resistant against the use of such spells on them/ Interestingly, gloamings were sensitive to the presence of nearby portals, and they were majorly resistant to [[psionic]]s.\n<!--==Combat==-->",
        "Society": "Although settlements were rare due to gloamings' wanderlust, gloaming settlements tended to run contrary to the dominant [[alignment]] of the area. They shunned all organized religion.\n\nGloamings detested [[drow]], sharing legends that told of drow capturing, torturing, and experimenting on gloamings. [[Illithid]]s did not find gloamings palatable and thus left them alone.\n\nGloamings were uncommon in the [[Underdark]] but almost never seen on the surface.",
