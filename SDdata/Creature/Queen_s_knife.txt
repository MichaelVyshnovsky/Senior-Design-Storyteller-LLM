The Queens Knife was a variety of fish found in the Sea of Moving Ice.
These fish sported knife-like protrusions.
Some sailors told a legend that these fish were knives thrown by the ocean goddess Umberlee at the hulls of ships that entered her domain. Though some, including the clergy of the goddess, disputed such a claim.
