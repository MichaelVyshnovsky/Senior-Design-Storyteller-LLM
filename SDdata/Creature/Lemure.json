        "mainbody": "Lemures ( ), also called squidges in infernal slang, were among the weakest of the baatezu devils.  They served as the shock troops and slave labor force of the devils, and were made from the wicked, cruel, and selfish mortals that found their souls in Hell.\nClassifed as least devils by some scholars but not even worthy of classification by most others, lemures were at the bottom of the infernal hierarchy, sitting just below the bloated nupperibos.\nLemures were hideous,  tall blobs of molten, stinking flesh that oozed across the ground as they moved. Even as their facial features melted and shifted they maintained a permanent expression of horror and anguish, with most constantly gibbering to themselves despite their inability to speak.\nHints of mortals former self could be seen in a lemure when they were not too twisted in anguish.\nLemures were almost completely mindless and effectively incapable of making decisions, even those that concerned themselves. They existed in a state of constant physical pain and sought revenge against reality itself as they blamed all the cosmos for their current condition, violently lashing out at all beings. Only the forced, telepathic mandates of their superiors  was able to restrain their thirst for vengeance, for lemures were sensitive to such messages, unquestioningly obeying the strongest devil nearby.\nNo matter from what kind of soul a given lemure was created, they normally retained nothing of their old personality or memory, although rarely a minor remnant of their memories would still be present. Unless directed, they behaved as if they had been feebleminded. However, despite their mindlessness, they were capable of a primary motivation for promotion and the innate understanding that this would occur if they somehow proved themselves.\nLemures were hard to kill as they had an inherent and tenuous, if slow, regeneration ability. Even if turned into ash, they could fully regenerate over time. One way to permanently kill them was to use holy implements such as a holy weapon or holy water. Lemures had a complete immunity against any effects that attempted to tamper with their minds, due to not having minds to manipulate.\nLemures shambled forward in infernal legions at the command of their masters telepathy, thoughtlessly slaughtering everything in their path and stopping only at the telepathic commands of their superiors. They usually attacked their prey by clawing them apart or beating them into submission. They were individually weak and their tactics, or what passed as such, consisted of swarming their enemies and relying on their numbers, although they didnt always need great numbers to succeed.\nSaid numbers could reach more than a thousand under a single devil commander, allowing them to march in a special wedge formation called a \"battle drive\", which allowed them to hit more accurately.\nLemures were the lowest of the baatezu, despised by other devils, regularly abused and lacking a true name. They served the most base duties in any infernal group acting as fodder to draw enemy fire in any initial confrontation.\nWhen not engaged in battle, lemures were left in the fiery spawning pits of Hell to torture any mortal souls that they found swimming amid the hellfire. Lemures were suspected to be of infinite numbers and often wandered Avernus and Dis in massive hordes.\nIt was presumed that the mindlessness of the lemures was by design so that the baatezu could easily influence the lower caste into choosing the path of evil. With this mindlessness came the lack of a \"lesson\" that the lemure needed to learn if it wanted a promotion. Souls that arrived in the Nine Hells in the form of lemures, driven only by their desire to do evil, had the many rules of Baator driven into what passed for their minds by patrolling amnizu.\nAs low as a lemures position was, they had a shot at a high position in the infernal hierarchy as any lemure was at least theoretically capable of rising through the ranks up to pit fiend rank and from there to higher nobility.\nThe process was mostly randomized, however, based on the need of the promoter rather than the merit of the lemure, although occasionally such a process was used for amusement. When a lemure had the chance to be promoted to a spinagon, it sometimes had to fight against other lemures up for the position. After one won, its skin was taken away to reveal the form of a spinagon. It was also entirely possible the devil in charge of the fight would simply kill the winner if the fight failed to be entertaining.\nPromotion at such a low level was something that could be done by a greater devil and was done when there was some demand for a specialized skill, such as the common transformation into an imp, or strangely into a wraith or spectre. Conversely, it was entirely possible for a higher-ranking baatezu to commit such a severe crime that it was demoted to lemure status, causing them to lose all their memories.\nGenerally speaking, only the most vile of mortal souls could achieve lemure status. When a soul arrived in Baator, they were shipped to torture stations and underwent a process of unimaginable agony, wracking their souls with pain, infusing them with fury and wringing them out of all their energy. as well as the work of kyton and excruciarch teams to turn their petitioner victims into proto-lemures. Once completely drained of energy, the souls underwent arcane rituals that corrupted them with infernal power. The process of lemure creation was concluded with dropping the proto-lemure into the Maggot Pit in Avernus, whereupon the drained husk would swiftly die before being reborn as a lemure.\nThey could also be made from soul larvae, although, out of about a hundred thousand, only about a dozen were turned by the devils into lemures after a natural selection process. It was also possible for lemures to be made through demoting the nupperibos that naturally appeared from soul larvae. Occasionally, lemures even spontaneously pulled themselves from Baator itself although such an event was rare.\nIf a lemure did not manage to get a promotion, something that was effectively a matter of chance at their low station, it was over time absorbed into Baator like the petitioners they truly were.\nLemures needed more frequent but shorter rests than higher-ranking devils, stopping whenever they could to satisfy the five minutes they needed to be fully recovered. They were genderless devils that had no sex organs."
