        "Description": "These beholders were significantly larger and of genius intelligence. Despite the nomenclature, Hive mothers are asexual and genderless like other beholders.\n\nThey were fanatical and had natural resistance to [[magic]]. Hive mothers had enormous mouths for devouring foes. Some retained the signature eye rays which are individually capable of devastating magical attacks, but others have been documented without the stalks, instead having the eyes embedded in its upper body.\n\nThe central, dominating eye of the Hive mother generates a 240 foot antimagic cone which suppresses all magical and supernatural effects.",
        "History": "There was a hive mother inhabiting one of the lower levels of [[Watcher's Keep]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}."
