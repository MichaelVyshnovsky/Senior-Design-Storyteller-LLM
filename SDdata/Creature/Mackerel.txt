'''Mackerel''' was a group of species of tiny schooling fish found throughout various climates across the Realms, often caught as a cheap source of food.

==Description==
Mackerel's scales varied from blueish to silver in color, depending on the climate of their habitat. The mackerel icefish were notably fattier than their warmer climate cousins.

==Behavior==
Mackerel's schooling behavior was their primary defense against predators.

==Ecology==
[[Wa]]'s oceans provided its fisherfolk with abundant harvests of mackerel, as well as [[tuna]], [[salmon]], and [[squid]].

===Species===
* Mackerel icefish: a species of fish found in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

===Uses===
* Baked or grilled mackerel icefish was a popular food among the residents of [[Frozenfar]] and [[Ten Towns]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==History==
During the chaos of the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], mackerel, fished by the [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavians]], was affected by the uncontrollable magic permeating the world. The silvery fish schools were attacking boats, sinking numerous vessels, and stopping many others from sailing out of the City of Splendors' harbor. The story of the killer fish spread far that year.
