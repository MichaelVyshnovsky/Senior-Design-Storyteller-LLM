'''Poisonous toads''' (or '''poisonous frogs '''&mdash; the terms were more or less interchangeable{{Cite dragon/247/Dragon's Bestiary: The Anurans|88}}) were a species of [[giant frog|giant toad]] whose bodies secreted a weak, hemotoxic [[poison]].

==Description==
These creatures were largely indistinguishable from the most common, mundane species of giant toad. Like any species of toad, their skin was consistently dry, rough to the touch, and marked by many warts.

Those referred to as "frogs" typically were smaller in size.

==Biology==
By biting creatures, these toads passed on a poison that sent victims into a comatose state.

==Combat==
Besides their poisonous bite, these toads fought with their tongues like any other.

==Ecology==
These creatures lived in colonies of up to eight members.

===Diet===
Poisonous toads were a carnivorous species.

===Habitats===
Poisonous toads typically inhabited regions with a warm to temperate climate, sometimes living underground. Like any species of giant toad, they lived near bodies of water where they could lay their eggs.

On [[Toril]] they were known to inhabit the marshes of [[Cormyr]], including the [[Farsea Marshes]], [[Marsh of Tun]], and [[Vast Swamp]].
