        "mainbody": "Singing fish was a species of fish found in the Akanamere of the Akanal.\nThese fish were consumed in the coastal city-states of the Blade Kingdoms, such as Sumbria, Kirenzia, Zutria, Lomatra, and Lotoli. The fish was considered a fanciful treat and was served in the Palace of Manniccis during the Festival of Blades, alongside whole-roasted ostriches, sweetened orange rinds, hamsters in sauce, and copious amounts of local wines."
