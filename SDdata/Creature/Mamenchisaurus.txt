Mamenchisaurus () was a species of dinosaur.
Mamenchisaurs were sauropods. Their massive body supported what is likely the longest neck of any natural creature found on Toril. Their neck is a full  in length. Their neck contains nineteen vertebrae, which were supported by bony connections. This prevented the mamenchisaurus from bending its neck other than their head. 
When targeted by a predator, mamenchisaurs used their tails as a destructive whip.  
Mamenchisaurs were found living in swamps. 
Mamenchisaurs were herbivores and solitary creatures. Their long neck allowed them to reach the foliage from any tree.
