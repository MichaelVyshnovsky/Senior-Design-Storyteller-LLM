        "mainbody": "'''Utahraptors''' were a large species of carnivorous [[dinosaur]]s found in [[Chult]].",
        "Description": "Similar in appearance to [[deinonychus]] but much larger, utahraptors stood upright on two legs with a large tail for balance. They had {{SI|12|in}} claws on their feet, as well as razor-sharp teeth and arms ending in {{SI|10|in}} long claws. They had excellent natural camouflage, with brown skin with green striping.",
        "Combat": "An attacking utahraptor was vicious and brutal. Their teeth and claws caused horrible damage. The claws on their feet were sharp enough to eviscerate a creature. They were strong and agile. They used their camouflage to attack prey in ambush attacks. Their legs were very powerful, allowing them to leap up to {{SI|15|ft}} high, up to {{SI|40|ft}} if they had a running start. They had a natural immunity to ''[[fear]]''-based spells.",
        "Society": "Utahraptors were pack animals. Their packs were matriarchal, with the strongest and largest female as leader. They co-operated with each other and coordinated their attacks. They were territorial and very protective of their young.",
        "Ecology": "Utahraptors lived in dense forests or jungles. Their diet consisted purely of meat."
