'''Elemental liches''' were a form of [[lichdom]] achievable only by [[elementalist]]s.

==History==
During the days of [[Netheril]], a group of [[mage]]s banded together to defeat a [[demilich]] known as [[Kangaxx]]. Unable to fully destroy him, the mages were forced to become [[lich]]es themselves in order to imprison him. One of these mages became an elemental lich.

In [[1369 DR]], [[Gorion's Ward]] was tricked by the imprisoned demilich into retrieving his [[gold]]en skeletal torso from the [[Netherese]] elemental lich.

==Society==
===Homelands===
Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], these liches could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].
