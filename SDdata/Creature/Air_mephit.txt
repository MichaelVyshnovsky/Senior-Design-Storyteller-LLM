An air mephit was a mephit from the Elemental Plane of Air.
An air mephit was about four feet (120 centimeters) tall and weighed only a pound (half a kilogram). They had pale white skin. Like all mephits, air mephits were impish in appearance and had wispy wings, which sprouted from their humanoid upper torsos. They had whirlwinds where one would expect their legs to be.
Air mephits tended to be more skittish than other mephits.
Air mephits could heal themselves as long as there was moving air present. They had the ability to breathe a conical cloud of dust and grit. They also had the innate power to surround themselves with vapor about once every hour or to call forth a powerful gust of wind once per day. They were immune to the effects of lightning or poisons.
Air mephits would rather flee than fight, but, if pressed, would attack by biting and clawing and also by injuring opponents with their breath.
Air mephits preferred living in places where the wind was constantly blowing, such as mountaintops or shores.
The drow god Vhaeraun was served by air mephits, and they were sometimes sent by him to aid his followers. They were also known to serve the good archomental Chan, keeping an eye on the daily issues of her realm.
