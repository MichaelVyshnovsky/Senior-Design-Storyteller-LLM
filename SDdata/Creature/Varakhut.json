        "mainbody": "Varakhuts were inevitables charged with preventing creatures from usurping the powers of the gods, for they knew that the lack of deities would mean only chaos. They did not worship any deities themselves, and defended deities of all moralities, ethics, and pantheons equally.\nTheir overall shape was an abstract one that could vaguely be called humanoid, but their bodies were blocky and contained intricate clockwork rather than muscles or tendons. Small spheres that resembled planets and stars in miniature could be glimpsed inside their metal frames at times.\nIn the World Tree cosmology, the inevitables were found in Dweomerheart, the realm of Mystra."
