        "mainbody": "A '''fission slime''' was a type of [[slime]] that could rapidly multiply.",
        "Description": "The very rare slimes were dark green in color, and had large sludgy bodies.",
        "Combat": "The oozes attacked by [[poison]]ing foes, as well as [[magic]]ally [[slow]]ing them. After their foes retaliated, the slimes would split, forming new slimes, which would also engage in combat. The new slimes could also be split further, resulting in a large amount of them spawning, if their foes continued to attack them. They would only cease to multiply, and die, when exposed to fire.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], fission slimes were known to inhabit [[Durlag's Tower]]."
