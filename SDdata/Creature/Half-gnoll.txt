'''Half-gnolls''' were [[humanoids]] with both [[human]] and [[gnoll]] ancestry.

==Description==
Most half-gnolls were large muscular beastmen with wild fur and yellowed teeth. Many half-gnolls had monstrously large canine eyes and snouts like a [[wikipedia:hyena|hyena]] which ended with a human nose and pink lips.

==Personality==
Even though these monsters acted and lived with gnolls, they seemed to think with human intelligence.

==Combat==
In battle, many half-gnolls wielded large [[sword]]s and rusty [[dagger]]s.

==Ecology==
These abominations were very rare, but a few had been seen in [[Phlan]] around the [[Moonsea]] area.
