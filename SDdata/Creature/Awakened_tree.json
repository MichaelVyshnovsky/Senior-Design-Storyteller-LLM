        "mainbody": "n awakened tree was simply put a mundane tree that possessed some form of intelligence, often by means of the awaken spell or other magic.\nWhen an awakened tree remained still, it appeared as if it were an ordinary, unremarkable tree of its type.\nThey were granted the ability to speak the language of their creator.\nThey were well-protected against attacks from bludgeons or weapons with a piercing edge, but were especially vulnerable to being harmed by fire.\nAwakened trees slammed their foes in combat.\nCirca the late 15 century DR, one awakened tree remained within the garden of the Temple of the Restful Lilly. It was kept by the evil hag, Vile Sazha.\nAround that same time, coniferous awakened trees were sometimes witnessed accompanying frost druids that dwelled in the wilderness of Icewind Dale.\n* Hallastree, the personal usher of Wyllow, an apprentice to Halaster Blackcloak with her own domain in Undermountain.\n* Lifferlas, the longest-living resident of Goldenfields as of the late 1480s DR."
