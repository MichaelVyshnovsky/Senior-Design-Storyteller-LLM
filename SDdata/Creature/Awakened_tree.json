        "mainbody": "An '''awakened tree''' was simply put a mundane tree that possessed some form of intelligence, often by means of the ''[[awaken]]'' spell or other magic.",
        "Abilities": "When an awakened tree remained still, it appeared as if it were an ordinary, unremarkable tree of its type.\n\nThey were granted the ability to speak the language of their creator.\n\nThey were well-protected against attacks from bludgeons or weapons with a piercing edge, but were especially vulnerable to being harmed by fire.",
        "Combat": "Awakened trees slammed their foes in combat.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], one awakened tree remained within the garden of the [[Temple of the Restful Lilly]]. It was kept by the evil [[hag]], [[Sazha|Vile Sazha]].\n\nAround that same time, coniferous awakened trees were sometimes witnessed accompanying [[frost druid]]s that dwelled in the wilderness of [[Icewind Dale]].",
        "Notable Awakened Trees": "* [[Hallastree]], the personal usher of [[Wyllow]], an apprentice to [[Halaster Blackcloak]] with her [[Wyllowwood|own domain]] in [[Undermountain]].\n* [[Lifferlas]], the longest-living resident of [[Goldenfields]] as of the late 1480s [[DR]]."
