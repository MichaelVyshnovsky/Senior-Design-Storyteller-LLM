        "mainbody": "'''Viperfish''' were an uncommon predatory species of deep sea [[fish]]",
        "Description": "Viperfish varied considerably in size. At their smallest they measured around {{SI|1|in}} and a half, with the largest natural size being around {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}}. Some more monstrous specimens of this species were found to grow as large as {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in length.\n\nOne of the most distinguishing features was the long, fang-like teeth that filled their large mouths. These teeth were designed so as to fold into their mouths with ease whenever a viperfish needed to close it, acting as bars to prison prey trapped and to prevent a viperfish from losing their grasp on any prey that turned out to be larger than they could reasonably handle.\n\nThese creatures were also distinguished by the bio-luminescence emitted by circular spots along dual rows on either side of their bodies, as well as by patches within their mouths. And the whip-like growths that protruded from the area of their head analogous to a chin. A select view viperfish were noted as having special whip-like growths that functioned similarly to tentacles, allowing them to constrict their prey.",
        "Abilities": "These fish sensed where they were going both by sight, aided by their bio-luminescence, and from their whip-like growths. These growths acted sort of like antennae, extensions of their lateral senses that could detect nearby movement within the ocean.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Viperfish.png|thumb|''The fish.'']]\nViperfish were active hunters that preyed upon other unsuspecting creatures of the deep sea, luring them in with their bio-luminescence. They typically resorted to swallowing their prey whole. Attacking them to free captured prey was ill-advised, as doing so was more than likely to injure the prey as well.",
        "History": "Over the years many attempts were made to study these peculiar fish alive, but these attempts mostly wound up fruitless as specimens tended to die less than half a [[bell (time)|bell]] after being captured. This continued to be the case as late as the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "These creatures were a carnivorous species that sometimes tried to prey upon creatures larger than themselves.",
            "Usage": "The flesh of a viperfish was edible, though it was not particularly pleasant."
