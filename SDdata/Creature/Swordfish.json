        "mainbody": "wordish were a peaceful species of predatory fish, named for their flat pointed bills that resembled swords.\nBeing non-aggressive creatures, swordfish typically fled from conflict unless provoked or trained to engage in combat. When they did fight, a swordfish would use their long sword-like bills.\nMedium-sized swordfish were often kept as pets or utilized as guards by other creatures, typically aquatic elfs and dolphin communities. The Lambent Eye of Ravens Bluff served swordfish encrusted in nuts, while Nimbers Skewer Shop offered grilled swordfish and mango skewers.\nSwordfish were also an occasional prey of spiretop dragons. It took a small flock to kill a single swordfish.\nSwordfish inhabited the Sea of Swords,the Bay of Dancing Dolphins, and in the Golden Gulf, off the coast of Sikak and Maribar Island.\n*Longships that hailed from Gundarlun Island often depicted swordfish on their figureheads.\n*Waterdeeps Dock Ward had a mascot â€“ a green swordfish on burgundy background."
