Faerie fiddlers were an odd and obscure species of fey.
Faerie fiddlers resembled extraordinarily thin, withered old men only  tall, always dressed in somber and archaic clothes. They always had a minute, wonderfully crafted fiddle.
Faerie fiddlers were perpetually cheerful creatures who were lively and spry despite their aged appearance. Their only motivation was to protect other members of their community and to make the world a little more pleasant.
Faerie fiddlers had a number of natural magical abilities, which they channeled through their music. The least of their magical tunes was one that they often wove into other tunes, a tune that prevented those who danced to it from experiencing hunger, thirst, or fatigue while dancing. A more forceful tune was similar to Ottos irresistible dance, and the most powerful tune they could play was similar to time stop for every hour spent dancing, a year would pass in the outside world. This could only be played during the full moon and was reserved for use against those people who offended the faeries greatly without overtly attacking them.
Faerie fiddlers themselves were immune to all charm and enchantment magic. They knew all the languages of faeriekind as well.
Faerie fiddlers never started fights, but protected themselves and their companions with their magic if one broke out.
Faerie fiddlers were curious fey, considered by some to be icons of fey society. They always lived in a community with other fey, but there was never more than one fiddler in any community.
Priests of Erevan Ilesere were capable of assuming the form of a faerie fiddler through use of the spell faerie form.
