        "mainbody": "The Meth was a breed of light warhorse known for its short legs and sturdy disposition. They were popular in the Vilhon Reach and cost about 45 platinum pieces.\nA Meth was usually gray or other solid colors. A Meth was stronger, tougher, and wiser than most light horses, but it ran a little more slowly, owing to its compact build.\nMeths were first bred in Unther near the border to Chessenta around 1000 DR. They were used for pulling chariots in the Old Empires."
