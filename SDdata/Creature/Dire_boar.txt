Dire boars, also known as giant boars or elotheridae, were a type of unusually large and aggressive boar.
Unlike ordinary pigs, dire boars were vicious and would attack any creature that approached.
Dire boars typically tried to charge their opponents and gore them with their tusks.
Giant boars, much like regular boars, traveled in groups known as "sounders." The number of giant boars in a sounder varied, but oftentimes it totaled up to eight.
Giant boars were an omnivorous species.
In northwest Faerûn, these creatures could be found in Neverwinter Wood.
In the Shining South they were known to inhabit the Channath Vale and the Forest of Amtar.
Beyond Faerûn, dire boars were known to inhabit the moors, deciduous forests, and coniferous forests of the Moonshae Isles. As well as the land of Chult. In Anauroch, they could occasionally be found in the fertile areas of the Plain of Standing Stones.
Some humanoid races were known to domesticate dire boars, such as orcs, gray orcs, and dwarves, the latter of which referred to their dire boar mounts as "thundertusks." However, domestication was a difficult process, and after being domesticated dire boars were still known to be quite fierce and dangerous.
