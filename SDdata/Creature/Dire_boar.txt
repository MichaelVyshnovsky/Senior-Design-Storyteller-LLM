'''Dire boars''', also known as '''giant boars''' or '''elotheridae''', were a type of unusually large and aggressive [[boar]].

==Behavior==
Unlike ordinary pigs, dire boars were vicious and would attack any creature that approached.

==Combat==
Dire boars typically tried to charge their opponents and gore them with their tusks.

==Ecology==
Giant boars, much like regular boars, traveled in groups known as "sounders." The number of giant boars in a sounder varied, but oftentimes it totaled up to eight.

===Diet===
Giant boars were an omnivorous species.

===Habitats===
In [[northwest Faerûn]], these creatures could be found in [[Neverwinter Wood]].
In the [[Shining South]] they were known to inhabit the [[Channath Vale]] and the [[Forest of Amtar]].

Beyond [[Faerûn]], dire boars were known to inhabit the moors, deciduous forests, and coniferous forests of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. As well as the land of [[Chult]]. In [[Anauroch]], they could occasionally be found in the fertile areas of the [[Plain of Standing Stones]].

===Relationships===
Some [[humanoid]] races were known to domesticate dire boars, such as [[orc]]s, [[gray orc]]s,<ref>{{Cite web/Excerpts/Races of Faerûn}} and [[dwarves]], the latter of which referred to their dire boar [[mount]]s as "thundertusks." However, domestication was a difficult process, and after being domesticated dire boars were still known to be quite fierce and dangerous.

==Notable Dire Boars==
* [[Bal'alak]], a giant dire boar that terrorized the jungles of [[Samarach]] in the [[Chultan Peninsula]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].
* [[Bristlebeard]]

==Trivia==
Dire boars were a [[favored animal]] of the deity [[Bahgtru]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10}}
