        "mainbody": "A granite destrier was an elemental of bizarre appearance, with a broad, flat, strong back. The dwarven geomancer Thormud Horn could summon one for transport.\nThe granite destrier summoned by Thormud Horn had a vague shape with six pillar-like legs, a vulpine head, and two seat-like depressions on its flat back. It was probably made of granite.\nGranite destriers carried extremely large loads tirelessly and as fast as the fastest horse at full gallop. They were not impeded by most terrain, being perfectly capable of making treks across hills or even mountains. The number of seats was adjustable by the summoner.\nThe granite destrier that Thormud Horn summoned never engaged in combat, even on those occasions its master was in mortal danger.\nThormud Horn summoned a granite destrier in the , as he habitually did when he needed to travel."
