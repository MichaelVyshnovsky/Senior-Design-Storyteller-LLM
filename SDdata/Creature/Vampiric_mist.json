        "mainbody": "A '''vampiric mist''', also known as '''crimson death''' or '''crimson mist''', was an incorporeal [[undead]] creature that fed on its victims' blood and body fluids. Vampiric mists were the remains of nearly destroyed [[vampire]]s that could not return to their resting places to regenerate.",
        "Description": "These vaporous creatures lurked in bogs, swamps, and other foggy areas where they could remain concealed and indistinguishable from the surrounding fog. They were vaguely shaped like the upper body of [[humanoid]] figures whose fingers formed long tentacles through which the creatures fed.",
        "Creation": "Vampiric mists were the remains of former vampires that, whether through massive damage or exposure to sunlight, dissolved into mist and were prevented from returning to their resting places in order to regenerate their physical forms. In that state, they were stripped of all personality and intelligence until only their thirst for blood remained.\n\nThere were other legends that suggested that crimson deaths could be the lost souls of mortals that had been turned into vampires. Yet another legend suggested that crimson deaths were instead extremely [[evil]] [[air elemental]]s that had been cursed and cast out of the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]. The creatures originally known as vampiric mists, meanwhile, were first thought to be immature crimson deaths, but were later discovered to in fact be the separate creation of a great vampire wizard.<ref>",
        "Behavior": "Due to their insatiable thirst, vampiric mists were inexorably attracted to the scent of blood, rushing towards any open wound or injury they could smell within one mile (1.6 km). Although vampiric mists were completely devoid of their previous intelligence or personality, they still retained some of the behavioral characteristics of vampires. For example, they could not enter a residence uninvited.\n\nIt was also possible to forge alliances with a vampiric mist, as long as a constant supply of victims was provided.",
        "Combat": "Vampiric mists avoided combat, except to feed or to defend themselves. When attacking a creature, the mist's tentacles wrapped around its victim, causing its blood to escape through pores, eyes, nose or mouth, with no pain or discomfort caused to the victim.\n\nAlthough they were virtually undetectable and very agile when not fed, once they started filling with blood they became progressively redder, until they became saturated with blood and started dripping it out. In that state, they were more sluggish and much easier to detect.",
        "History": "Vampiric mists were known in legends throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. The [[sun elf]] [[vampire]] [[Jander Sunstar]] decided not to commit suicide for fear of becoming a vampiric mist.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|755}}, a [[disease|plague]] swept through [[Calimshan]] and the [[Lake of Steam]] that bled its victims to death before raising them as a crimson death. The outbreak was thus known as the [[Crimson Death (plague)|Crimson Death]].\n\nAmidst the havoc of [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the ''[[Sojourner's Portal]]'' in the [[House of the Moon]] became warped so that it worked the other way, and the mirror unleashed a crimson death and three vampiric mists from the depths of Undermountain into the heart of the temple. They hunted and slew a number of priests before they were stopped; the vampiric mists were swiftly destroyed, but the crimson death fled into the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers of Waterdeep]] and was lost.",
