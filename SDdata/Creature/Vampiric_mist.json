        "mainbody": "A vampiric mist, also known as crimson death or crimson mist, was an incorporeal undead creature that fed on its victims blood and body fluids. Vampiric mists were the remains of nearly destroyed vampires that could not return to their resting places to regenerate.\nThese vaporous creatures lurked in bogs, swamps, and other foggy areas where they could remain concealed and indistinguishable from the surrounding fog. They were vaguely shaped like the upper body of humanoid figures whose fingers formed long tentacles through which the creatures fed.\nVampiric mists were the remains of former vampires that, whether through massive damage or exposure to sunlight, dissolved into mist and were prevented from returning to their resting places in order to regenerate their physical forms. In that state, they were stripped of all personality and intelligence until only their thirst for blood remained.\nThere were other legends that suggested that crimson deaths could be the lost souls of mortals that had been turned into vampires. Yet another legend suggested that crimson deaths were instead extremely evil air elementals that had been cursed and cast out of the Elemental Plane of Air. The creatures originally known as vampiric mists, meanwhile, were first thought to be immature crimson deaths, but were later discovered to in fact be the separate creation of a great vampire wizard.\nDue to their insatiable thirst, vampiric mists were inexorably attracted to the scent of blood, rushing towards any open wound or injury they could smell within one mile (1.6 km). Although vampiric mists were completely devoid of their previous intelligence or personality, they still retained some of the behavioral characteristics of vampires. For example, they could not enter a residence uninvited.\nIt was also possible to forge alliances with a vampiric mist, as long as a constant supply of victims was provided.\nVampiric mists avoided combat, except to feed or to defend themselves. When attacking a creature, the mists tentacles wrapped around its victim, causing its blood to escape through pores, eyes, nose or mouth, with no pain or discomfort caused to the victim.\nAlthough they were virtually undetectable and very agile when not fed, once they started filling with blood they became progressively redder, until they became saturated with blood and started dripping it out. In that state, they were more sluggish and much easier to detect.\nVampiric mists were known in legends throughout Faer√ªn. The sun elf vampire Jander Sunstar decided not to commit suicide for fear of becoming a vampiric mist.\nIn the , a plague swept through Calimshan and the Lake of Steam that bled its victims to death before raising them as a crimson death. The outbreak was thus known as the Crimson Death.\nAmidst the havoc of Halasters Higharvestide in the , the Sojourners Portal in the House of the Moon became warped so that it worked the other way, and the mirror unleashed a crimson death and three vampiric mists from the depths of Undermountain into the heart of the temple. They hunted and slew a number of priests before they were stopped the vampiric mists were swiftly destroyed, but the crimson death fled into the sewers of Waterdeep and was lost.\nVampiric mists were solitary and preferred to hunt solitary humanoids as well, which were easier to hunt and could not call for help. They usually required at least one victim per week. It was common for a vampiric mist to carry valuable belongings or the remains of its former victims into its lair to serve as bait for other prey.\nIf a vampiric mist were captured and imprisoned inside a container, it could pass for a genie prison or another form of magical vapor. If released, the mist would immediately attack whoever freed it.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, vampiric mists could be found in the Domains of Dread."
