'''Leatherjackets''' were the larval form of the common [[Chult]]an [[fly (insect)|cranefly]].

==Ecology==
Leatherjackets were eaten by the freshwater [[fish]] of Chult's rivers.

===Uses===
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], they were a popular bait for fishing, notably among those brave or stupid enough to fish in the [[River Soshenstar]]. Leatherjacket bait sold for eight [[copper piece]]s.
