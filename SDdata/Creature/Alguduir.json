        "mainbody": "(Adult) (Juvenile)\nAlguduirs, also known as swamp dragons, were a semi-aquatic avian humanoid.\nAlguduirs were large avian-like humanoids. Their body was covered in thick scales which were covered in secreted oils. They had a pair of large wings which were mottled in various colors. A set of gills were located along their neck, under their beak.\nAlguduirs were skilled swimmers and could breathe underwater. The feathers on their wings were coated with oil. This oil allowed an alguduir to take flight once it emerged from water. Alguduirs has the natural ability to reflect spells cast at them back to the caster. This ability was involuntary, an alguduir was not able to selectively reflect spells.\nAlguduirs were very territorial and did not tolerate the presence of trespassers in their territory or near their lair.\nAlguduirs had very straightforward tactics for combat. If facing an aquatic foe, they grasped it with their talons and raised their opponent into the air, suffocating them. If facing a terrestrial opponent, they dragged it down into the water, holding onto their target until it drowned. Despite their four sharp talons on each foot, algudirs only used them to grasp onto a target, not as a weapon.\nAlguduirs were carnivores that fed on the fauna commonly found in marshes, including giant varieties. Alguduir would occasionally consume sentient beings.\nAlguduirs lived only in large marshes and swamps. They made their lairs on small patches of land deep within their swamp.\nIn Northwest Faer√ªn, some were known to dwell within the Mere of Dead Men."
