Ivory shieldmaidens were a type of construct summoned by an ivory horn of Valhalla.
Ivory shieldmaidens had pale skin of ivory. Their bodies were shaped to appear in line with an idealized human female warrior. Their unchanging faces were frozen in severe expressions. They had short ivory hair and were dressed in dark red battle garb with a single golden circle on their heads. They were armed with one-handed axes.
When called to battle, the shieldmaidens possessed martial prowess and some divine magics of a paladin.
The first ivory horn of Valhalla, was created by the powerful bard of the Moonshae Isles named Falataer. The horns summoned ivory shieldmaidens were used to test his students and copies of the horn were used as rewards. With years passing, ivory horns of Valhalla were copied and imitated. One such horn ended up in the hands of Skullcrusher some years before the . In his twilight years in the Neverwinter Wood, Skullcrusher kept the horn on his person, ready to summon all three ivory shieldmaidens to his defense if need ever arose.
