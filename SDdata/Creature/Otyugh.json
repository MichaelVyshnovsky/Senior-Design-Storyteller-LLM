        "Description": "Otyughs were strange-looking creatures, with bloated, oval-shaped bodies around {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} wide that stood on three shuffling elephantine legs and had a disgusting, rock-like hide. They had a pair of long tentacles that were bedecked in rough thorny growths and ended in leaf-shaped pads bearing rows of more sharp spikes. A third tentacle sprouted from the top of the otyugh's body, forming a vine-like stalk standing some {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} high, and ended in a pair of eyes and an olfactory organ. The body of the creature contained a massive fang-filled mouth, shaped like a crude gash through its center. A typical otyugh was around {{SI|500|lb|k|long=yes}} in mass.",
        "Behavior": "[[File:Otyugh_running-5e.jpg|thumb|350px|''An otyugh's body motion when running.'']]\nDespite its appearance and habits, an otyugh was somewhat intelligent and capable of speech in the [[Common]] tongue.",
        "Abilities": "Due to the nature of the otyughs' appetites, their mouths were filthy and often carried diseases like [[filth fever]], inflicted with a bite.",
        "Combat": "Otyughs were generally content to stay hidden in their lairs, usually only attacking living creatures if they felt threatened or hungry. They would slash prey with their thorny tentacles, or use them to grab and squeeze creatures and drag them into their maws.\n\nThe bite of an otyugh was a vector for all manner of [[disease]]s, including [[typhus]], [[filth fever]], and [[sewer plague]].",
        "History": "In the [[Arena of Blood]] in [[Manshaka]], hungry otyughs were kept to devour the carcasses of the slain, but they would seize an unlucky contestant given the chance. In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] drove a [[troll]] into its tentacles.{{Cite comic/Cat & Mouse|10, 12}}\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], otyughs could occasionally be found in the [[sewers of Waterdeep]].\n\nBetween [[1488 DR]] and [[1492 DR]], an unknown number of otyughs inhabited the bottom of the [[Refuse pit (Port Nyanzaru)|Refuse pit]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] and ate their fill daily. Thanks to their presence, the pit would not reach its brim.<ref>",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Otyughs were primarily omnivorous scavengers. They could consume almost all kinds of refuse and waste, such as carrion, offal, and many other things others would view as garbage. Nevertheless, they would take fresh meat when they had the chance.",
            "Habitats": "In the nation of [[Thay]], otyughs could be found in the [[Surmarsh]].<ref>",
            "Usages": "[[File:Arena of Blood and an otyugh.jpg|thumb|right|A hungry otyugh waits to devour the loser of a fight in the Arena of Blood.]]\nBecause of their habits, otyughs were often viewed as a convenient means of garbage disposal by many intelligent creatures dwelling underground. They would dump their garbage and waste in otyugh lairs, which would, most of the time, not attack them.\n\nThey were also employed as guardian creatures in [[sewer]]s and other foul areas."
