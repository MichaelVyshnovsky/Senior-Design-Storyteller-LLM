        "mainbody": "tyughs () were a type of gulguthra, strange aberrations that dwelt underground and delighted in eating filth and offal.\nOtyughs were strange-looking creatures, with bloated, oval-shaped bodies around  wide that stood on three shuffling elephantine legs and had a disgusting, rock-like hide. They had a pair of long tentacles that were bedecked in rough thorny growths and ended in leaf-shaped pads bearing rows of more sharp spikes. A third tentacle sprouted from the top of the otyughs body, forming a vine-like stalk standing some  high, and ended in a pair of eyes and an olfactory organ. The body of the creature contained a massive fang-filled mouth, shaped like a crude gash through its center. A typical otyugh was around  in mass.\nthumb|350px|An otyughs body motion when running.\nDespite its appearance and habits, an otyugh was somewhat intelligent and capable of speech in the Common tongue.\nDue to the nature of the otyughs appetites, their mouths were filthy and often carried diseases like filth fever, inflicted with a bite.\nOtyughs were generally content to stay hidden in their lairs, usually only attacking living creatures if they felt threatened or hungry. They would slash prey with their thorny tentacles, or use them to grab and squeeze creatures and drag them into their maws.\nThe bite of an otyugh was a vector for all manner of diseases, including typhus, filth fever, and sewer plague.\nIn the Arena of Blood in Manshaka, hungry otyughs were kept to devour the carcasses of the slain, but they would seize an unlucky contestant given the chance. In the , Vajra Valmeyjar drove a troll into its tentacles.\nIn 1357 DR, otyughs could occasionally be found in the sewers of Waterdeep.\nBetween 1488 DR and 1492 DR, an unknown number of otyughs inhabited the bottom of the Refuse pit in Port Nyanzaru and ate their fill daily. Thanks to their presence, the pit would not reach its brim.\nDwelling primarily underground, otyughs could be found skulking among piles of refuse and waste. They made such places their lairs, or else gathered refuse to fill their lairs. An otyugh spent the majority of time in its lair, burying itself in trash with only the sensory stalk protruding above the heap. It sat for hours on end, shoveling \"food\" into its maw with its tentacles.\nOtyughs were primarily omnivorous scavengers. They could consume almost all kinds of refuse and waste, such as carrion, offal, and many other things others would view as garbage. Nevertheless, they would take fresh meat when they had the chance.\nIn the nation of Thay, otyughs could be found in the Surmarsh.\nthumb|right|A hungry otyugh waits to devour the loser of a fight in the Arena of Blood.\nBecause of their habits, otyughs were often viewed as a convenient means of garbage disposal by many intelligent creatures dwelling underground. They would dump their garbage and waste in otyugh lairs, which would, most of the time, not attack them.\nThey were also employed as guardian creatures in sewers and other foul areas.\n*Uggie, a pet otyugh belonging to the adventuring group called the Fallbacks in the late 15th century DR."
