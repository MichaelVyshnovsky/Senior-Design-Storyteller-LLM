        "Abilities": "Besides the innate magical powers shared with common unicorns, celestial chargers were resistant to harm from [[acid]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], and [[spell]]s. The most powerful among them were also resilient against attacks from mundane weapons.\n\nLike all celestial creatures, an attack from one against an evil foe could sometimes cause more increased harm than the same blow would inflict on a non-evil creature.",
        "Notable Celestial Chargers": "The [[tome archon]] [[Raziel]] rode a celestial charger into battle named Temperion."
