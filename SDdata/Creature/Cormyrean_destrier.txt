The '''Cormyrean destrier''' was an exceptionally well-bred type of heavy [[horse|warhorse]], sought after throughout all of [[Faerûn]] but particularly prized in the [[West Faerûn|west]] and throughout [[the North]]. They were famously depicted in art from across the lands, especially in the tapestries of various palaces and keeps.

Despite their popularity throughout the continent, the finest destriers were found from ranches outside the [[Cormyr]]ean towns of [[Arabel]] and [[Waymoot]]. They could go for as much as 2,500 [[gp]].

==Description==
These imposing horses had a unique, raised nose and wide eyes that were full of expression.

==Origins==
These horses were originally bred by royal order of [[Azoun Obarskyr I|King Azoun I]], from stocks of [[Nars]] and [[Tharur]], around the year 400 [[DR]].
