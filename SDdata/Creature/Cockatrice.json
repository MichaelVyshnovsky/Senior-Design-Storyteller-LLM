        "mainbody": "The cockatrice was a small avian magical beast. It was notorious for its petrification ability.\nAlthough about the size of a large turkey or goose and weighing , a cockatrice more closely resembled a chicken, but it was a hideous hybrid with the wings of a bat and a lizard-like tail. This tail had yellow-green scales, its bat wings were a grey shade, their feet and beak were yellow, and their feathers were of a golden-brown hue.\nA male cockatrice had a roosters wattles and comb, which the females lacked. These wattles and comb, as well as the eyes and tongue of both sexes, were all red.\nCockatrices had an animal level of intelligence.\nFemale cockatrices were very rare, much more so than the males.\nThese creatures were closely related to the pyrolisk.\nAny creature that a cockatrice bit could be permanently turned into stone. Prior to the Time of Troubles, this petrifying aura extended even into the Astral and Ethereal planes, much like that of a basilisk.\nCockatrices were immune to their own petrifying bite and that of other cockatrices, though not of other petrifying creatures and spells.\nCockatrices ferociously attacked any creature that appeared to threaten them or their lairs. Typically, flocks of them would attempt to overwhelm or confuse their opponents, and flew at their faces.\nThese creatures could be found almost any region, though they typically inhabited temperate or tropical regions, either underground or above ground in plains.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, scattered numbers of cockatrices could be found in the Elemental Plane of Earth.\nSome creatures were known to harvest the venom of cockatrices. Following the Spellplague, this venom typically fetched a price of 100 gold pieces.\nCockatrice1.png|A cockatrice from 2nd edition.\nAdvance Trice.png|Another depiction of a cockatrice."
