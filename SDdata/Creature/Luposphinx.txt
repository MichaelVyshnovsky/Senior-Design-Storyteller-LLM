Luposphinxes were a rare subspecies of sphinx distinguished by their wolf-like heads. 
Luposphinxes were, like other sphinxes, largely leonine in form, about  in length, with feathered wings. Their wolvish heads set them apart from other sphinxes. The fur ranged from dark brown to light grey in color.
Luposphinxes were very intelligent but evil creatures that acted according to their desires.
Twice each day, luposphinxes could emit a frightful howl that could deafen and even panic creatures within  of them.
When a luposphinx got into a fight, they preferred to start with a howl, followed by melee attacks with their front claws and powerful jaws.
Luposphinxes lived in forested areas. They were generally solitary, although some were known to be served by xvarts or gnolls. They were also carnivorous and were known to prey on humanoids luposphinxes preferred the flesh of elves and halflings.
