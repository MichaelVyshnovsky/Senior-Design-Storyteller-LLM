        "mainbody": "'''Diamond golems''' were the strongest of the beautiful [[gemstone golem]]s. They were made entirely from [[diamond]]s.",
        "Description": "Diamond golems usually stood {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed thousands of pounds. They usually resembled muscular [[human]]s clad in armor, sometimes carrying swords and shields, though these were purely cosmetic additions and had no bearing on their combat effectiveness.\n\nUnlike other gemstone golems, diamond golems had something of a personality, and seemed obsessed with precision and perfection. This was demonstrated in the way they attempted to follow commands exactly, and in their slow and methodical approach to combat.",
        "Combat": "Diamond golems were totally immune to all forms of heat, acid, and electricity.\n\nThey struck at enemies with their fists, backed by the strength of a [[storm giant]], with devastating blows. Strong magical weapons were needed to piece their diamond armor. Diamond golems were mostly immune to any nature-based magic, making them extremely useful against the [[witches of Rashemen]].\n\nA diamond golem could spray a cloud of tiny diamond chips in all directions, causing great harm to any creature within a {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} radius. They could also emit a blinding blast similar to the divine ''[[sunray]]'' or ''[[sunbeam]]'' spell, and would do so prior to closing into melee combat. They would obsessively cast ''[[true strike]]'' before every melee attack, regardless of any tactical or strategical considerations.\n\nThe ''[[shatter]]'' spell was effective at harming diamond golems. ''[[Crystalbrittle]]'' reduced their immunity to nature, heat, acid, and electricity-based magic while also allowing slightly weaker magical weapons to penetrate their armor. A ''[[mending]]'' spell partially healed a diamond golem while ''[[glassteel (spell)|glassteel]]'' restored them to full health.\n\nDiamond golems, like all gemstone golems, were formidable opponents in battle. The easiest way to combat them was to disrupt the circle of [[wizard]]s that controlled them. Any disruption to the circle caused the diamond golem to wander aimlessly.",
        "Society": "[[File:Diamond golem 2e.PNG|thumb|240px|''A diamond golem with decorative sword and shield.'']]Diamond golems were used by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. A circle of at least a dozen wizards, led by a superior, was needed to control them. As of {{yearlink|1372}} diamond golems were more likely to be found outside of such powerful direct control. Those golems could either be free-willed, or still answering to a master, though their quirks limited their ability to follow orders effectively.\n\nCreating a diamond golem did not actually require enough diamond to craft the entire construct, but rather a diamond of no less than ten thousand [[gold pieces]] which served as the golem's \"heart.\" The rest of the body could be made of other materials, predominantly [[semi-precious stones]], totaling at least sixty-five thousand gold pieces. The magic of the golem's creation would transform these stones into diamond.",
        "Ecology": "A diamond golem would collapse into a pile of rough cut diamonds and powder when slain. The gems were quite valuable, and the powder could be used by wizards for [[spell component]]s although it was otherwise worthless, with most of the golem's creation material having been destroyed. The golem's \"heart\" would also be left behind.",
        "History": "Like all gemstone golems, the secret to creating diamond golems was devised by practitioners of [[gem magic]] in ancient [[Mulhorand]]. The secret was rediscovered by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Aznar Thrul]] in [[1368 DR]], who sought to use the golems to conquer [[Rashemen]]. However, by [[1372 DR]] he had lost control of his golems, who went rogue and spread out across the continent to pursue misremembered or gargled directives."
