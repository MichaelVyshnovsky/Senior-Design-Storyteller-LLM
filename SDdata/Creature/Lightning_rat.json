        "mainbody": "'''Lightning rats''' were a rural breed of [[dire rat]] found in the [[Delimbiyr Crescent]] in [[northwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "Like a regular dire rat, it resembled nothing less than an enormous [[rat]], with full-grown specimens weighing over {{SI|50|lb|k|long=yes}} and up to {{SI|4.5|ft|long=yes}} in length. They had spiky fur and long hairless tails, with sharp incisors, and appeared vicious with evil eyes. However, they were somewhat longer and leaner than typical dire rats, as well as faster, and might be mistaken for large [[otter]]s from a distance.",
        "Abilities": "They had a unique sonic bite, which made their bites slightly more injurious. They could even make sonic barks, much like [[dog]]s; these sounded surprisingly loud and sharp.\n\nLike dire rats, they were very good at climbing and swimming.",
        "Behavior": "Lightning rats were omnivorous scavengers, but as they hunted in cleaner, natural environments, they tended to be healthier than their dire rat kin and lacked their diseased bite. They would also attack to protect their nests and territories.\n\nThey lived in nests of three to twelve specimens and in packs of up to twenty.",
        "Combat": "They favored hit-and-run tactics, especially in packs, usually by running in and out of their burrows and biting their prey.",
        "Ecology": "Unique to the countryside of the [[Grayvale]] and Delimbiyr Crescent in the [[Savage Frontier]], lightning rats could be found living in burrows along riverbanks. They were recognizable to local people, but unfamiliar to those of other lands.",
        "Usage": "It was not unknown for [[goblin]]s to breed and train lightning rats to serve as guardians of their outposts and homes, a lot like others used dogs. Their sonic barks were effective in alerting their keepers to trouble.",
        "History": "[[Hekkut]] and his [[goblin]] bandits kept five lightning rats to guard their hidden base. The creatures lived in burrows and small caves by the river, on either side of the main entrance."
