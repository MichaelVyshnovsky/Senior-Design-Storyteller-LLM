A '''dun pudding''' was a rare deadly pudding that was adapted to arid deserts.

==Description==
Dun puddings had a yellow color, similar to that of sand. This made it easy for them to conceal themselves in desert environments.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1991}}

==Behavior==
Dun puddings were scavengers, but preferred to consume [[animal]] and vegetable matter. If such a meal was not available, the puddings could survive off of the silicates found in [[sand]].

==Combat==
When in combat, these puddings would use their internal secretions to dissolve their foes' equipment. They were very fast at dissolving all leather items, but were slower at eating through metals.

==Ecology==
Though usually found alone, dun puddings could form groups of up to four.
===Habitats===
In the [[Abyss]], dun puddings could be found in [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, [[Layers of the Abyss#222|222nd layer of the Abyss]].
===Relationships===
Dun puddings were a [[favored monster]] of [[Zuggtmoy]].
