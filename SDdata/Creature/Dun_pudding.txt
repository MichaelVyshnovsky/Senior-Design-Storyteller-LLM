A dun pudding was a rare deadly pudding that was adapted to arid deserts.
Dun puddings had a yellow color, similar to that of sand. This made it easy for them to conceal themselves in desert environments.
Dun puddings were scavengers, but preferred to consume animal and vegetable matter. If such a meal was not available, the puddings could survive off of the silicates found in sand.
When in combat, these puddings would use their internal secretions to dissolve their foes equipment. They were very fast at dissolving all leather items, but were slower at eating through metals.
Though usually found alone, dun puddings could form groups of up to four.
In the Abyss, dun puddings could be found in Shedaklah, the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss.
Dun puddings were a favored monster of Zuggtmoy.
