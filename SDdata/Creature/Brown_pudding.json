They could grow up to  in diameter.\nInstead of corroding metals, brown puddings dissolved wood and leather. They consumed items made of such materials in about a minute, even if they were highly enchanted.\nThey were known to be found among traps in Undermountain on Toril, and even in the Castle in the Tears of Sel√ªne asteroid cluster. In this instance, the dangerous puddings fed upon ravens and grass. They hid themselves very well, making them notoriously difficult to eradicate.\nIn the Abyss, brown puddings could be found in Shedaklah, the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss."
