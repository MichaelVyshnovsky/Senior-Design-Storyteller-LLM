            "Habitats": "They were known to be found among traps in [[Undermountain]] on [[Toril]], and even in [[the Castle]] in the [[Tears of Sel√ªne]] asteroid cluster. In this instance, the dangerous puddings fed upon [[raven]]s and grass. They hid themselves very well, making them notoriously difficult to eradicate.\n\nIn the [[Abyss]], brown puddings could be found in [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, [[Layers of the Abyss#222|222nd layer of the Abyss]]."
