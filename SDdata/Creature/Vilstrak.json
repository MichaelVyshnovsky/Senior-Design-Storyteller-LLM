        "mainbody": "ilstraks, also known as marl muggers and tunnel thugs, were very rare stone-skinned creatures that dwelt in hollow caverns.\nThese medium-sized bipeds appeared to have more arm joints than a regular humanoid would. Their rock-like bodies allowed them to merge with other rock-like structures, as well as earth. Thus, vilstraks often went undetected, even when other beings were only twenty feet away.\nTheir stony outer bodies gave them great defense in combat encounters. Being able to merge into rock, they would often surprise their foes and strike out with their powerful fists.\nVilstraks, which gathered in groups of up to twenty, made their homes in hollow stone or earth. Thus, these creatures could only be found by other creatures that had the ability to burrow to their lairs. Being of low intelligence, these marl muggers (as they were often called by humans), sometimes made dens that were easily found. Their lairs were known to sometimes contain rare treasure, which vilstraks seemed to hoard.\nThey were known to dwell across the Savage Frontier, particularly in the difficult-to-reach areas of Southkrypt, an abandoned dwarf stronghold."
