        "mainbody": "A '''gorgimera''' was a type of [[chimera]] that had its caprine features replaced by those of a [[gorgon]].{{Cite dragon/94/Ecology of the Chimera|24-26}}",
        "Description": "Gorgimerae had three heads: one of a [[lion]], one of a [[red dragon]], and the other of a gorgon. The parts of the beasts closest to their heads had leonine features, their mid-sections (including the wings) were draconic, and their hindquarters were those of gorgons. As the caprine parts of chimerae were essentially swapped out with the blue metallic armor and aggressiveness of [[magic]]al creatures, this variant of a chimera was more powerful. Gorgimeras with heads of other colors, and thus different breath weapons, were also known.\n\nMore rarely, a gorgimera could have a gorgon head in place of its central lion head, resulting in a hybrid of gorgon, goat, and dragon.",
        "Combat": "Gorgimerae had several types of attack, such as biting with their lion and dragon heads, ramming with their gorgon heads, and striking with their lion claws. As well as the typical [[dragon breath]] of a chimera, the gorgimera's gorgon head's breath could [[petrify]] foes immediately, turning them to stone. Some gorgimeras were without lion's jaws or claws, instead showing a goat's head.\n\nSuch crossbreeds of chimerae could, due to their gorgon heads, see into both the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] and [[Ethereal plane]]s, and their petrifying breath extended into them. Gorgimeras with other breath weapons, such as cold, were also known. After the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, gorgimeras were more widely known to have other possible dragon-breath elements, and furthermore, to be immune to the element breathed by their dragon head.",
        "Ecology": "These creatures came about by the crossbreeding of chimerae and gorgons. Unlike chimerae, gorgimerae were sterile, and thus unable to breed, making them extraordinarily uncommon, thankfully.\n\nDue to the extreme rarity of such creatures, they were not often seen. However, reports of such creatures were heard in the [[Underdark]], [[Shadowdale]], the [[Savage Frontier]], near the [[Storm Horns]] in the [[Stonelands]], and one had even been captured in the [[Halls of the Beast-Tamers]]. A variety of white gorgimera was known to dwell on the [[Icepeak]].",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], an [[illithilich]] known as the [[Beast Lord]] was rumored to be creating gorgimerae close to [[Waterdeep]].\n\nIn [[1367 DR]], a gorgimera attacked some of [[Vorik Aris]]' men near the Storm Horns in the Stonelands while he prepared for waging war against [[Cormyr]].\n\nDuring [[Highharvestide]] in [[1369 DR]], gorgimerae and [[manticore]]s spawned in [[Shadowdale]]. The monsters were repelled and killed by [[Elminster Aumar]], [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], and the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]."
