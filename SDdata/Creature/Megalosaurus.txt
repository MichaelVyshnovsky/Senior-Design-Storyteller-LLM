Megalosaurus (), also known as little tyrant on the Malatran Plateau, was a carnivorous species of dinosaur.
Megalosaurs were a type of carnosaur and smaller than their cousins the allosaurus and tyrannosaurus. It had a large jaw filled with razor-sharp teeth. Their claws were not as sharp.  
Megalosaurs primarily targeted sauropods as prey. They attacked with their strong jaw to drag a target to the ground.
Megalosaurs were carnivores and lived alone. Unlike most carnosaurs, they were capable of walking on all fours.
