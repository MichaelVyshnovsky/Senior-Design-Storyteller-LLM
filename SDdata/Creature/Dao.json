        "Personality": "Dao were generally evil beings that saw nothing wrong in enslaving others, despite greatly fearing the loss of their own freedom and despising whoever would imprison them. However, they would almost always return acts of fairness and kindness.\n\nDao took great pride in things that were well made and plots that were well-planned.",

            "Magic": "Dao possessed an innate spellcasting ability. This allowed them to cast the spells ''[[detect evil and good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', and ''[[stone shape]]'' at will. They could cast ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[passwall]]'', and ''[[tongues]]'' each three times per day. And they could cast the spells ''[[conjure elemental|conjure elemental (earth)]]'', ''[[gaseous form]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[phantasmal killer]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', ''[[wall of stone]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', and ''[[spectral force]]'' each once per day."

They were ruled from their capital city of the [[Sevenfold Mazework]] by their Great Khan [[Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil]].\n\nBeyond the Elemental Plane of Earth, dao could be found living in great numbers on the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust]], the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals]], the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Magma]], and the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze]].\n\nBeyond those [[plane]]s, dao could be found roaming with magical protection across all of the [[Inner Planes]], as well as the Astral and Ethereal planes, in search of creatures to enslave.\n\nSometimes lone dao could be found on the Prime Material plane, hoping to open up new markets and supply lines for their empires. When on that plane they preferred to be in mountainous terrain, as it reminded them of their home plane, while mortal cities made them feel unease.",
            "Relationships": "Dao were generally on both speaking and trading terms with [[efreet]], When it came to other types of genies, they held nothing  but scorn and hatred towards [[djinn]], [[marid]]s, and [[jann]]. Dao that lived on the Para-Elemental Plane of Magma sometimes engaged in warfare with the efreet that inhabited the plane.\n\nOther creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth generally avoided the dao in fear of being enslaved. Creatures that could move through stone, like the [[xorn]], were used by them as scouts to determine future digging sites.\n\nPowerful [[wizard]]s on the Prime Material were often known to lure dao on to that plane and trap them inside of magical gemstones or ''[[iron flask]]s''."
