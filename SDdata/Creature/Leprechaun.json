        "mainbody": "'''Leprechauns''' were tiny, mischievous [[fey]] creatures who loved treasure.",
        "Description": "Leprechauns were a small people, standing only about {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} tall on average. They had pointed ears and noses. A little more than a quarter of all males sported beards.\n\nThe clothing of leprechauns usually included pointed shoes and pants and coats of browns, grays, or greens. Stocking caps or wide-brimmed hats were their two head coverings of choice.",
        "Personality": "Leprechauns loved to play pranks and were prone to steal valuable trinkets from travelers. They especially loved gold, and hoards of it could be found in every leprechaun abode. If an intruder stole their treasure, they would beg and bargain to get it back at any cost.\n\nLeprechauns ate the same sorts of foods as [[human]]s. Most had a very strong weakness for fine [[wine]], and many enjoyed smoking pipes.\n\nMost leprechauns were not very trusting of either humans or [[dwarves]], finding both races to be too greedy, but they were on good terms with [[elves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s. In general, they would be cordial with strangers but never invite them to their lairs. If they found an injured person, such a one might be taken to a leprechaun lair for help but only if blindfolded and not followed.",
        "Biology": "Some scholars believed that leprechauns were related to both [[halfling]]s and [[pixie]]s.\n\nLeprechauns did not reproduce often, so children were rare in their families. A newborn leprechaun had all of the magical abilities of an adult.",
        "Abilities": "Inherently magical beings, leprechauns could [[Invisibility|turn invisible]] whenever they wanted. They could also [[Polymorph any object|polymorph objects]], [[create illusions]], and [[Ventriloquism|throw their voices]].\n\nLeprechauns had very keen hearing, making it very hard to surprise them.",
        "Combat": "These playful creatures avoided combat, instead using tactics of deception to mislead. However, they would not sit by if weaker creatures were harmed.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "In the Realms, they were found in the [[Forest of Tethir]],",
            "Languages": "Leprechauns spoke in the [[Sylvan]] language. They used first names and their clan name as a surname.",
            "Religion": "The patron deity of leprechauns was [[Sqeulaiche]], Court Jester of the [[Seelie Court]]."

        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that leprechauns had the power to grant [[wish]]es, much like [[genie]]s, but would only do so as a means to gain back stolen treasure. They were said to be able to grant three wishes but would claim to be able to grant a fourth. If the wisher made a fourth wish, his or her three granted wishes would be reversed, and the hapless person would find him- or herself [[teleport]]ed miles away, never to find the leprechaun again."
