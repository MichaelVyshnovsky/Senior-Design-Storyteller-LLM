'''Nighthaunts''' were the weakest and smallest type of [[nightshade]].

==Description==
Nighthaunts were said to somewhat resemble a [[gargoyle]] made of night and shadow, including curling horns and a tail. The eyes were the only part that were a different color: they were pale and lifeless orbs inset into the flat, triangular face.<ref>

==Personality==
Nighthaunts were thoroughly malicious creatures that took pleasure in the destruction of the good and the innocent.

==Abilities==
Like the other nightshades, nighthaunts radiated a [[desecrate|desecrating]] aura of great power, but were averse to sunlight. Additionally, nighthaunts could drain the energy of living creatures by pressing their blank face against their victim's.

Nighthaunts possessed a number of spell-like abilities, being able to mimic ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', and ''[[unholy blight]]'' at will; ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[greater dispel magic]]'', ''[[haste]]'', and ''[[invisibility]]'' thrice each day; and ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', and ''[[plane shift]]'' once each day.

One time each day, a nighthaunt could summon either 3-6 [[shadow]]s, 2-4 [[wraith]]s, or 1 [[greater shadow]] to aid it.

==Combat==
Nighthaunts preferred to harass well-organized or stronger opponents from a distance with the spell-like abilities, often using ''deeper darkness'' and ''invisibility'' to cause confusion and division. They typically went for spellcasters first when they entered melee.

==Ecology==
Nighthaunts were native to the [[Plane of Shadow]], but they were drawn to places of defiled goodness and evil power, such as desecrated temples and emptied graveyards.

==History==
In [[1375 DR]], a nighthaunt named [[Ysval]] led an army of undead with the goal of conquering [[Thay]].
