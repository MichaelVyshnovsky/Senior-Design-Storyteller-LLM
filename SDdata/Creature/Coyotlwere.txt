A '''coyotlwere''' was an [[antherion]] that was found in [[Maztica]].

==Description==
Coyotlweres were [[coyote]]s that could transform into [[human]]s. They usually appeared on their own or in a pair, and rarely as three, and could command packs of coyotes. They tended to be loners.

==Society==
They dwelt in a few places across Maztica, such as the lands of the [[Dog People]] and the [[Pasocada Basin]]. They could also be found close to [[Nexal]], in the [[Narabatun Jungle]]
