A coyotlwere was an antherion that was found in Maztica.
Coyotlweres were coyotes that could transform into humans. They usually appeared on their own or in a pair, and rarely as three, and could command packs of coyotes. They tended to be loners.
They dwelt in a few places across Maztica, such as the lands of the Dog People and the Pasocada Basin. They could also be found close to Nexal, in the Narabatun Jungle
