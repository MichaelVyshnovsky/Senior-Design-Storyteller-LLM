These creatures plotted against one another with cunning similar to creatures found on the lower planes. They would try to corrupt any [[sha'ir]] who summoned them.",

            "Relationships": "Noble efreet viewed all living creatures as servants or enemies. Because of this, many other creatures native to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] would gladly assist anyone attempting to harm or embarrass a noble efreet."
