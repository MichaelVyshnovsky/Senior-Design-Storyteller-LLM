A '''black Bane minion''' was a [[Bane minion]] that was equally skilled in fighting, and both the [[cleric]]al and [[wizard]]ly arts.

==Description==
Black Bane minions were slower and had lesser physical prowess than the other known types of Bane minions. However, these minions were very intelligent and wise.

==Combat==
These creatures had a large amount of abilities they could use to take down their foes. They used their natural [[acid]] breath attacks and an assortment of [[spell]]s, such as ''[[ice storm]]'' and ''[[hold monster]]''.
