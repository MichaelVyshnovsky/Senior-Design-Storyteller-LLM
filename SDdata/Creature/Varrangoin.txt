'''Varrangoins''' were malevolent [[Abyss]]al hairless bat-like creatures who often played roles of mercenaries.

==Description==
Varrangoins resembled emaciated man-sized humanoids with huge leathery bat wings, terrifying skull-like faces, and dark grey or black skin. Their tails were barbed on their ends and filled with a potent poison. Varrangoins were extremely sensitive to sunlight. Each varrangoin had an elemental breath weapon they were born with: acid, fire, cold, or electricity. Upon the creature's death, it would explode with the same energy that was their's breath weapon element.

==Personality==
Generally, these fiercely territorial beings formed communities in pitch-black areas of the Abyss, like caves. Arcanist varrangoins could be compared to [[wizard]]s who guarded their arcane knowledge jealously. They owned and used [[spellbook]]s that were valuable and only passed along to the most promising students who were especially good at groveling and subservience.

==Combat==
Varrangoins preyed on creatures weaker than themselves. The arcanists preferred to herd the unruly flocks of lesser varrangoins into battle, mainly to shield themselves from danger while showering the victims with [[magic]]. They always had an escape spell ready. The ragers loved the thrill and gore of battle and often were on the front lines. The arcanists would often use [[illusion]] magic to inflate the flock's size and cause fear and chaos.

==Society==
Their colonies often numbered more than a hundred varrangoins, claiming up to several miles for themselves if left unchecked.

Varrangoin did have predators in the Abyss, like [[Armanite|Armanites]], who would devour the prey and their spirits, stopping the circle of reincarnation and resurrection.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the [[cambion]] [[Vheod Runechild]] sought [[Karreth Edittorn]], a tower that held a portal to [[Toril]]. The tower belonged to a group of varrangoin who let the cambion use it purely to spite [[Nethess]] and [[tanar'ri]] in general.
