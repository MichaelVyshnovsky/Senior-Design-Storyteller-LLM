        "Description": "Iceborns were exact clones of an individual,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|24}} While it was not obvious from their appearance, iceborns were hollow constructs made wholly of living ice.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|26}} They did not appear to breathe.\n\nIf defeated in battle, an iceborn would loudly crack and shatter. They could not be knocked unconscious, and instead would fall to pieces.\n\nCreating an iceborn required the flesh of the individual being cloned.",
        "Personality": "Similar to clones produced by the ''[[clone]]'' spell, iceborns were fully sentient and believed themselves to be the person from whom they had been cloned.",
        "Abilities": "An iceborn's touch, breath, and even glare were supernaturally cold, and could even injure creatures that were normally resilient against such cold. In turn, an iceborn was highly resistant to the cold, and could absorb and weaponize the cold. They could also confer some resilience against cold to nearby allies.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|27,29}} \n\nIceborns could fly.",
        "Notable": "* The Ice Queen [[Iyraclea]] created an iceborn clone of herself and concealed it in a vault beneath the [[Delhalls]] in [[Vaasa]]. The clone survived the [[Spellplague]] and sought to escape when an earthquake opened the way to its prison in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}."
