        "mainbody": "Ningyo () were sentient aquatic humanoids native to Kara-Tur. They were cousins of merfolk.\nNingyo had the upper body, arms, and head of a human from the waist up and instead of legs they had a fish-like tail from the hips down. They were often seen wearing pieces of intricate jewellery made from colorful shells and pearls.\nNingyo had red, curly hair and gold or silver eyes.\nNingyo were kind and peaceful creatures.\nNingyo avoided combat if possible. But if they were forced to defend themselves, they were efficient fighters. Their preferred weapons were spears and tridents.\nUnlike their Faer√ªnean cousins, as wu jen or shugenjas.\nNingyo lived in schools of up to 30 individuals. A school was led by a single chieftain. Large schools usually had up to eight dolphins living with them, who acted as assistants and guards to the ningyo. \nNingyo had a long tradition in serving the Lord of the Sea as loyal subjects. Although they werent compelled to obey him, they rarely ignored his requests or summons.\nNingyo were apathetic to the world outside the ocean and ignored the affairs of humans. Despite this, ningyo would offer aid to victims of sunken ships. This has led to ningyo being greatly respected by sailors of Kara-Turs oceans, who made offerings to ningyo while on voyages.\nNingyo maintained peaceful relationships with all other good sea creatures, especially cetaceans, lung wang, and sea spirit folk.\nNingyo were nomadic and lived in the open ocean, only constructing temporary underwater structures for a female who was about to give birth. Ningyo schools followed schools of fish and the currents. They were a common sight between the islands of Kozakura.\nWhile ningyo were able to breath air, they rarely went onto land as it was painful and caused them harm. They could be seen sunbathing on flat rocks that were just at the waterline, and, like dolphins, they greatly enjoyed leaping into the air, performing complex spinning maneuvers while in the air, before diving back into the water.\nNingyo were long-lived and gave birth to up to four children every decade. An infant ningyo matured rapidly, reaching full maturity in about two years. \nA ningyos diet was varied. They ate all types of small fish species and enjoyed crab and oysters as delicacies. They also consumed plankton and seaweed."
