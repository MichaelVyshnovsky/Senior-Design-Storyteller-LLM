A stone colossus, which was also called a statue-that-walked, was an extremely rare and powerful form of stone golem.
These creations resembled extremely large stone golems.
These immensely powerful creations only attacked with their fists. They could only be harmed by enchanted weapons. A transmute rock to mud spell would slow them for several minutes, while a transmute mud to rock spell would completely heal them. A flesh to stone spell did not cause them harm, but did allow mundane weapons to harm them while the spell was active. A stone colossus was immune to all other forms of magic. The mere sight of a marching stone colossus usually sent all enemies fleeing in terror.
Once activated, a stone colossus reverted to its original programming that required it to destroy any edifice not constructed by its original creator. Supposedly there was a way to reprogram them, but this method was lost to history. They could be stopped from their rampage by a detailed ritual that lasted for days and involved placing special glyphs on all existing stone colossi.
The stone colossi were magical warriors created by a race of giants who once inhabited the Old Empires.
