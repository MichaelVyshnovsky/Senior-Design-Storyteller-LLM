        "Description": "At first glance, pterafolk in their natural forms looked like tail-less [[lizardfolk]] or [[saurial]]s, but they were much taller and leaner and had elongated cranial crests like [[pteranodon]]s. They had smooth, fine scales, much like those of a snake, that ranged in color from forest-green to light shades of tan. Their arms and legs were thin and long, and their hands and feet bore sharp claws.<ref name=TJoC:MC/><ref name=VL-p80/><ref name=MC:MoF-p74/><ref name=SK-p50/>\n\nPterafolk did not wear clothing, except for belts and [[bandolier]]s for carrying small items.<ref name=SK-p52/>",
        "Personality": "While not all lizardfolk were [[evil]], it was generally agreed that pterafolk were cruel and vicious as a rule.<ref name=TJoC:MC/><ref name=VL-p80/> They were highly untrusting of anyone outside their own race.<ref name=SK-p51> They had an innate predilection towards violent behavior, but those raised in other societies sometimes had the capacity to overcome this tendency and take on alignments beyond evil.<ref name=SK-p52 />\n\nPterafolk liked to collect things valued by the communities near where they lived.<ref name=TJoC:MC/>",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Batiri attack.png|thumb|''[[Batiri]] and pteramen attack jungle adventurers.''|360x360px]]\nSimilar to how a [[yuan-ti]] could change its form at will into a snake, the pterafolk could \"unfurl\" a pair of eight-foot-long, leathery, webbed wings for flying or even take the form of a small pteranodon. They tended to only use such forms when they wanted to fly.",
        "Combat": "Pterafolk rarely strategized, but they had certain tactics they used regularly in combat. They used dive-bombing tactics, dropping from altitudes of 100 feet (30 meters) or more to swoop down on their foes and strike with their rear claws, toothed beak, or barbed spears. They preferred circling their opponents and diving upon them in turn such that there would be a constant stream of diving attacks from all directions.\n\nSome clans cared little for training and relied only on instinct in battle. Others had a form of organized training that produced [[fighter]]s, [[barbarian]]s, or [[ranger]]s. If they wore armor or used weapons&mdash;often barbed [[spear]]s&mdash; they were custom-made to not interfere with flight.",
        "Society": {
            "Magic": "Pterafolk distrusted [[magic]], so spellcasters were very rare among them, and they would usually destroy any magical items they found as spoils. If the tribe was overseen by a [[spirit naga]], it might train up acolytes who could cast [[divine magic]].",
            "Language": "Pterafolk, like most reptilian creatures, spoke [[Draconic language|Draconic]].",
            "Religion": "After the breakup of the [[World Serpent]], most pterafolk took to worshiping [[Shekinester]], the goddess of spirit nagas. They held that the primary forces of nature were chaos and destruction. They followed their deity by bringing about more destruction into the world."

        "Biology": "[[File:Pterafolk 3e MoF.png|thumb|A pterafolk takes flight.|355x355px]]Pterafolk ate both meat and vegetables. Their favorite meats were from [[wikipedia:en:Brontotheriidae|brontotheres]] and [[wikipedia:en:Paraceratherium|hornless rhinoceros]]&mdash;massive prehistoric mammals still roaming in the jungles of Chult&mdash;and [[axebeak]]s&mdash;mammoth flightless birds. They also consumed jungle fruits, roots, bark, and flowers.\n\nPterafolk mated for life. Females laid eggs high on mountain peaks and both parents guarded the eggs. When the young reached adulthood, they would leave the tribe and form smaller bands until they could establish territory or a tribe of their own.\n\nIt was exceptionally rare for a pterafolk individual to die of old age; death in battle was expected.",
        "History": "Sages and scholars of [[Faerûn]] believed that lizardfolk evolved from pterafolk. Rumors among adventurers claimed that pterafolk were the result of magical experiments on pteranodons.\n\nIn fact, neither tale was true; pterafolk were one of the many creations of the [[sarrukh]] of [[Mhairshaulk]] and were bred from lizardfolk. The pterafolk gave the sarrukh armies more power, owing to their flight and viciousness, but they were also more difficult to control.\n\nAfter the fall of Mhairshaulk, many of the sarrukh's enemies attempted to hunt down and destroy the pterafolk.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], the god [[Kossuth]] led a war against the pterafolk after appearing below the [[Peaks of Flame]] and choosing a [[firenewt]] named [[Chassan]] as his avatar.\n\nWhile they usually kept to themselves, in [[1363 DR]], [[Kaverin Ebonhand]] had managed to convince several dozen of them to fight with him in his assault on the holy city of [[Mezro]]. They dropped rocks and explosive items upon the city from the air. When Kaverin was slain by the famous [[Harpers|Harper]] [[Artus Cimber]], however, the pterafolk abandoned the fight.",
