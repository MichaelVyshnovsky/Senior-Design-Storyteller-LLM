They do not experience as much wanderlust as the other halflings subraces.\nThis subrace of halflings had the unique ability to communicate telepathically with any creature within  of them that spoke the same language.\nMany ghostwise halflings were barbarians. In the Chondalwood, some ghostwise halfling warriors became nightgliders, warriors who rode giant owls.\nthumb|right|250px|A ghostwise archer protecting her stricken band as they shelter in undergrowth.\nGhostwise halflings were very elusive and were generally isolated from the outside world. They often lived a nomadic life in clans. Those who left the clan often carried a token of some important natural feature in their clans territory, such as a stone or a vial of water from a stream. Losing ones token was considered a sin and required an act of atonement assigned by the clan leader.\nGhostwise halflings worshiped Yondallas Children, the halfling pantheon. Most of the tribes of the Chondalwood chose either Sheela Peryroyl or Urogalan as their particular patron.\nAlong with the lightfoots and stronghearts, ghostwise halflings were one of the original tribes of the Lluirwood in Luiren.\nAround , a ghostwise halfling cleric named Desva began leading the ghostwise in the worship of Malar and violence, performing savage acts on the creatures and other halflings of the forest. In , the stronghearts and lightfoots allied against the ghostwise and battle continued for years until Chand of the stronghearts slew Desva in . Most of the surviving ghostwise left Luiren for the Chondalwood, making an oath that they wouldnt speak until they had atoned for their savagery.\nthumb|300px|right|Two ghostwise halflings in the Shining South.\n* Blaen Haltspear, a psionic ghostwise who slew the dragon Amilektrevitrioelis.\n* Perinsa Falmarya of Chondalwood\n* Hamil Alderheart, companion of Geran Hulmaster.\n* Gilern Ghostwise, who led a band of ghostwise on the Sword Coast North"
