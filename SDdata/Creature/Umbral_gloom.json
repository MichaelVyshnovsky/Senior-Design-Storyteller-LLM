        "mainbody": "Umbral glooms were a type of evil outsider that served Shar, goddess of shadows and sorrow.\nUmbral glooms appeared as masses of rubbery-skinned tentacles coal-black in color, seeping a shadowy miasma. Numerous purples eyes of various sizes, from as small as a pea to as large as a dinner plate, dotted the body. They were some  in diameter but weighed barely .\nUmbral glooms sought to spread grief and misery without regard to any characteristics of its victims an umbral gloom counted itself wealthy if it had spread such loss and suffering to many innocent people.\nUmbral glooms were powerful, deadly fiends with a number of abilities. Their many eyes meant they could see in all directions at once and kept them from being blinded they could also see even in magical darkness. They were not effected by energy drain, sleep, stunning, paralysis, or polymorph effects and they were immune to poison and damage caused by ice and cold.\nUmbral glooms had several spell-like abilities, being able to mimic the effects of knock at will and scare, modify memory, and plane shift (itself only, to the Plane of Shadow only) thrice each day and nightmare once each day. They could also innately decrease the output of any natural light sources with  of themselves, as well as radiate magical darkness from their body to fill an area with radius of .\nAs creatures of shadows, umbral glooms could naturally blend into any nearby shadows (except in full daylight). They could also teleport between shadows up to  apart. Even worse, they were blessed by Shar and infused with shadow-stuff, enhancing their natural armor and their resistance to spells of illusion, enchantment, necromancy, and darkness. Once each day, an umbral could could share that blessing with others (almost always a worshiper of Shar or Mask).\nUmbral glooms could speak Common, but spoke to each other in Loross. They could speak through the shadows of the mind to any creatures from the Plane of Shadow as well as worshiper of Shar and Mask, as long as said creatures were within  of the umbral gloom.\nUmbral glooms preferred to hide and remain hidden until they could ambush an enemy in any given combat they would start by trying to extinguish or remove any light sources first. If surprised, an umbral gloom would try to put out the lights and then flee in the resultant confusion.\nTheir usual choice of weapons was their own tentacles, for they could cause any creature they touched to feel crushing despair. Moreoever, they could engulf a creature smaller than them within their tentacles.\nUmbral glooms predominantly served Shar, and were often summoned by her clergy for various purposes- or sent by her to punish wayward clerics at other times. However, a number of umbral glooms were subverted by Mask to serve him, an occurrence made stranger by Shars seeming tolerance of the theft."
