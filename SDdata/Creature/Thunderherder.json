        "mainbody": "'''Thunderherders''', otherwise known as '''ashworms''', were a rare species of large [[worm]]-like creatures, distantly related to the more infamous [[purple worm]]. Their name was derived from the approach of their herds eliciting a sound reminiscent of thunder.",
        "Description": "On average, the body of a thunderherder grew to be {{SIrange|3|5|ft|long=yes}} wide and {{SIrange|5|10|ft|long=yes}} in length. Their bodies were covered in a thin layer of chitinous, pale purple plates. On one end of their body was a large, stinger.",
        "Behavior": "Unlike their cousin the purple worm, thunderherders were relatively non-aggressive creatures.",
        "Biology": "Thunderherders secreted a substance from their bodies that allowed them to stick to vertical surfaces. Their large stinger was [[poison]]ous.\n\nThunderherders could carry very heavy loads of supplies. A small load for them was roughly equal to and below {{SI|500|lbs|k}}, a medium load capped off at {{SI|900|lbs|k}}, and the heaviest load they could manage was {{SI|1400|lbs|k}}. However, they were capable of dragging upwards of {{SI|6900|lbs.|k}}.",
        "Combat": "When engaging a creature in combat, thunderherders would rise from the earth and coil themselves. They would then lash out with their large stinger.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Thunderherders were only known to be found within the deserts or plains of warm regions.\n\nIn the Realms, they were primarily known to inhabit the [[Raurin desert]].",
            "Relationships": "The movement of their bodies typically caused tremors in the earth that would cause confusion above ground and panic pack animals. Even the movement of a single thunderherder could unleash small tremors in an area.\n\nSome creatures were known to capture and train thunderherders for use as [[mount]]s. When this was done, a trainer typically clipped off their dangerous stingers. They were often difficult to control in combat situations."
