Loquasphinxes were Truespeak-wielding sphinxes.
Though leonine and winged, they had uncannily human faces with daggerlike teeth and haunting green eyes.
Even the friendliest was not very cooperative, and all of them were largely solitary. They typically attacked only when attacked, or when another else had something they wanted, whether food, information, or money. A good enough conversationalist could get them to break off attack, typically by appealing to their curiosity.
Besides their physical abilities, loquasphinxes wielded the ability to use truespeak to pose riddles, which were likely to confuse their targets unless they themselves had some grasp of that speech. They knew a number of utterances, most likely spell rebirth, moderate word of nurturing, speed of the zephyr, knights puissance, agitate metal, analyze item, and shockwave.
They used their riddles from a distance to weaken creatures, resorting to physical attacks only against targets that were conversant in truespeak enough to counter their interrogation.
Largely solitary, the creatures largely spent most of their time observing and practicing their truespeak. They preferred to be left alone, but could be roused to converse in exchange for tidbits of information that tempted them, or for large bribes.
