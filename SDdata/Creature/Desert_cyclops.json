        "mainbody": "Desert cyclops were large humanoids native to Zakhara distinguished by their single eye.\nA desert cyclops appeared generally similar to a human but was somewhat taller and with a disproportionately well-muscled upper body. Their rough skin had the color of sand. Their most striking feature was the single unblinking blue eye at the center of their heads, which gave them the ability to see through lies.\nTheir attire could vary as widely as their lifestyles, from normal full clothing down to shorts made from animal hides.\nDesert cyclops varied greatly in temperament but were generally wary and secretive towards Zakharan society at large, as they were often met with prejudice. They were not by nature aggressive but would go to great lengths to defend themselves and their families.\nIn combat, desert cyclops either attacked with both of their mighty arms or wielded two-handed weapons. Only a few of them wore armor, (which was difficult to come by for their size and shape,) but all were well-protected by their tough skin.\nDesert cyclops followed different lifestyles, but most lived as small groups of hunter-gatherers. Some lived alone far removed from inhabited areas. Some of them tried to engage in conversations whenever the rare opportunity arose to mitigate their isolation. Very few desert cyclops became members of human society, and even fewer were truly accepted there.\nWhile most desert cyclops inhabited the warm desert areas of Zakhara, they could live in any climate and terrain.\nA desert cyclops would eat the same food as humans but liked to season their dishes with sand."
