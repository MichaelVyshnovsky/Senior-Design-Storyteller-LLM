Falcons were small birds of prey, often used in hunting.
Falcons looked similar to hawks but were smaller in size.
Falcons were obligate carnivores. Larger falcons were known to prey on small humanoids.
Falcons made their nest in trees and in underground burrows. 
Falcons were a favored animal of the Mulhorandi god Anhur and the halfling god Arvoreen. They were sacred to the goddesses Milil and Red Knight as well. 
Moon elves had a special fondness for falcons and often kept them as pets. Centaurs within the forest of Cormanthor kept small flocks of falcons for use as guards and scouts. In some human lands, such as Cormyr, formal education among the aristocracy included falconry. Some rangers kept falcons as animal companions.
At the market, a well-trained falcon could be sold for up to 1,000 gp.
