        "mainbody": "'''Humanoid gargantua''' ({{SingPl}}) were gigantic creatures native to [[Kara-Tur]]. They were the largest [[humanoid]]s found on [[Toril]] and the least intelligent [[gargantua]].",
        "Description": "Humanoid gargantua were massive humanoids, taller than even the tallest [[giant]]s found elsewhere on Toril. They had large heads, up to {{SI|15|ft}} in height from top to bottom. They had unkempt hair that often grew down to their gibbous shoulders. They had a large, protruding jaw, rounded nose and massive ears. Nearly all had a pair of eyes but single-eyed specimens were reported.",
        "Behavior": "Humanoid gargantua were emphatic and peaceful creatures.",
        "Biology": "Humanoid gargantua had a long lifespan, living several hundred years. Once they reached maturity, they searched for a mate, whom they paired with for the remainder of their natural life. Once every century, a female humanoid gargantua gave birth to one or two children.",
        "Abilities": "Humanoid gargantua were able to regenerate any damage from physical attacks.",
        "Combat": "In combat, humanoid gargantua used their massive fists to inflict terrible damage. While their fingers were too large to wield weapons, they would use whole tree trunks as clubs. Their large size also allowed them to dispatch an opponent by merely stepping on them.",
        "Society": {
            "Diets": "The diet of humanoid gargantua varied. They hunted animals for meat and foraged for fruits and vegetables. Their favorite meals were [[deer]], [[bear]]s, and [[horse]]s.",
            "Habitats": "Most humanoid gargantua were found in remote jungles, mountainous valleys, or islands across Kara-Tur. One particular island, the [[Isle of Gargantuas]] near [[Wa]], was home to all varieties of gargantua. They made their lairs in large caves or grottoes. Humanoid gargantua did not collect or horde treasure.\n\nOutside of Kara-Tur, they were known to occasionally be found in the following high peaked and wooded mountain ranges within the [[Hordelands]] - [[A-Ling Shan]], [[Chigiogi Mountains|Chigiogi]], [[Hagga Shan]], [[Katakoro Shan]] [[Kun-Yen Shan]], [[Ulhai Shan]], [[Yehimal Mountains|Yehimal]]."
