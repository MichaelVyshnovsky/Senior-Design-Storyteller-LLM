Half-giants were a race resulting from the union of humans and giants.
Half-giants were often between 7 and 8 feet (2.1–2.4 meters) tall and weighed roughly 250–400 pounds (113–181 kg), and the males were markedly bigger than the females. They usually had black hair that they tied back tight and deep coppery complexions.
Many half-giants had the same tendencies as their human ancestors, being curious and keen to cooperate and communicate with other creatures and tending to be kind.
They also learned very quickly the traditions and morals of societies in the regions that they settled in.
Half-giants, because of their heritage, boasted a powerful build that allowed them to carry heavier loads and wield larger weapons, but because of that they were also not that nimble.
They were also naturally acclimated to fire and hot temperatures, and a few were born that were naturally psionic.
Half-giants settled in the deepest part of the desert.
They had a certain disdain for religion and sometimes even spoke badly about deities. However, this was not because they didnt believe in deities, instead that they thought that deities dont always prioritize the best interests of their worshipers. In some cases, however, some half-giants decided to become priests or even clerics.
Cruel sorcerer-kings of the world of Athas bred the half-giants into existence to become warriors and laborers, and many early half-giants died during childhood. The half-giants that survived childhood had a life of nothing but suffering ahead of them. But a few half-giants discovered that they had a psionic spark through the forced breeding and managed to escape and seek a new home deep in the desert
