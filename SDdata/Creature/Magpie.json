        "mainbody": "Magpies were a mundane avian species in the Realms.\nThe song produced by magpies sounded like \"queg queg queg...\"\nMagpies were highly attracted to small, shiny or brightly-colored objects, such as gems or rings. They would often swoop down and steal such objects without ever touching the ground, taking it back to their nest.\nThese birds were adverse to fighting, even when threatened.\nMagpies typically lived in forests, farm lands, and even the urban areas of regions with a temperate climate.\nIn the Realms, magpies acted as servants of the deity Gwaeron Windstrom. One of the tasks they would carry out for him would be to obscure clues indicating a trail from a followers foes or to reveal such clues to his favored trackers.\n* Horace, an unusually intelligent magpie that was owned and trained by a thief in the Vast known as Sigird Sigirdson.\nIn the Kara-Tur city of Balanzia, there was an inn known as the Yellow Magpie."
