        "mainbody": "'''Gremishka''' were miniature [[cat]]-like creatures born from unstable [[magic]] that hunted spellcasters.",
        "Description": "Gremishkas were small monstrosities that somewhat resembled a feline with the skin of a rodent and ears resembling those of a [[bat]]. They also had razor-sharp teeth.",
        "Abilities": "The most notable ability of a gremishka was their aptitude to react to any magic cast within 30 feet of them, which caused them to either create a blast of magical energy, heal themselves, or split into a swarm of smaller gremishkas.\n\nGremishka were also able to mimic the sound of a wounded animal or small child, which could be used to lure [[adventurer]]s into traps.",
        "Behavior": "Due to being born from unstable magic, gremishka hunted for magic of any kind to devour. They preferred to live in places with ambient magical energy and would chew through any [[spellbook]]s and [[material component]]s that they came across. They would compulsively hunt down spellcasters and often infested their homes.",
        "Combat": "Gremishkas usually attacked with strength in numbers. It was imperative that magic attacks should not be used against them as this would benefit them greatly."
