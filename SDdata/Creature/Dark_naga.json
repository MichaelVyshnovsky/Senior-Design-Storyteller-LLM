        "mainbody": "A '''dark naga''' was a variety of [[naga]] that looked like a large purple [[snake]] or eel with a barbed stinger at the end of its tail and a human face. Dark nagas could speak [[Common]] and [[Infernal language|Infernal]]. They liked to plot with other sinister creatures so that they could gather wealth more easily.",
        "Description": "Dark nagas measured up to approximately {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} long.. Their scales were dark blue or purple, often with black frills or scale patterns. The body of a dark naga was more similar to that of an eel rather than a snake. Its tail ended in a poisonous stinger.\n\nTheir veins contained an oily black or dark brown gore. The ''[[dark naga poison|naga poison]]'', or venom, was a thick black viscous fluid that dripped from the tail singer's venom canal when agitated.",
        "Society": "Dark nagas descended from [[Terpenzi]] were called [[nagara]].",
        "Combat": "Dark nagas would attempt to use high terrain to their advantage to stay out of the reach of their enemies.",
        "Abilities": "They could cast [[sorcerer]] spells and their stings carried a poison that could induce a nightmarish sleep. They were resistant to all charm effects and had the permanent ability to ''[[detect thoughts]]''. Similarly, their own thoughts could not be read.",
        "Allies": "The [[Zhentarim]] were known to use dark nagas as mentors and leaders for bands of [[orc]]s. Dark nagas also worked as divine servants of the [[duergar]] goddess [[Deep Duerra]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}",
