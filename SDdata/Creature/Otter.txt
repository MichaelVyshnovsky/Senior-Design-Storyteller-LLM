'''Otters''' were a species of aquatic mammal distantly related to [[weasel]]s.

==Description==
Otters were very fast moving creatures, both in terms of running and swimming. Those that inhabited oceans were typically larger than their more land-locked kin.

==Behavior==
These creatures were very friendly and had a very playful nature. During storms, sea otters tended to come ashore or swim upriver, searching for shelter inside alcoves or small caves. Some would simply wait on the banks of rivers and wait for the storm to pass.

==Biology==
Sea otters seemingly possessed an innate sense of how severe coming storms would be.{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|15-16}}

==Combat==
Otters generally tried to avoid combat. They were only known to attack other creatures when threatened, cornered, or their young were threatened.

==History==
Many years prior to [[1492 DR]],{{BG-DiA-time}} the [[wizard]] [[Traxigor]] was ''[[polymorph]]''ed into an otter. He came to conclude that he preferred his new form to that of his elderly body and used the [[spell]] ''[[wish]]'' to make it permanent.

==Sub-Species==
;[[Giant otter]]: A monstrous variety of the standard otter.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to weather folklore in [[Interior Faerûn]], the farther upriver a sea otter swam and the more of them that were huddled together indicated how long and severe a storm was going to be.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Otters primarily ate [[fish]] and crustaceans.
===Habitats===

Otters could be found in a variety of fresh and saltwater aquatic environments, including rivers, lakes, and oceans. Ocean otters were typically found near shallow, coastal waters.

They could be found all along the [[Sword Coast]], the coasts of [[the North]], and all their outer islands. They also inhabited the lake [[Maer Dualdon]], the lake [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]], and the [[Delimbiyr River]].

In Interior Faerûn they could be found in and around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], where they sometimes swam up one of its many rivers in search of food. and [[The Vast]]. 

In [[south Faerûn]] they inhabited the [[Lake of Steam]]. In the [[Unapproachable East]], they could be found in the nation of [[Aglarond]] in the [[Tannath Gap]].

Beyond [[Faerûn]], they could be found in the [[Hordelands]] at the lowest levels of the [[Katakoro Plateau]]. In neighboring [[Kara-Tur]], they could be found all throughout that continent's forests, jungles, and steppelands. Sea otters were particularly found in its climate climate ocean bodies.

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], otters could be found in the [[River Oceanus]].<ref>

===Relationships===
In Interior Faerûn, fishing communities often looked to sea otters as indicators of how severe a coming storm was going to be due to their storm-related habits.

They were typically favored as pets by [[water genasi]]. Some aquatic [[ranger]]s were known to have them as [[animal companion]]s. And some [[elves]] were known to have them as [[familiar]]s.

===Usages===
Some creatures were known to hunt otters for their pelts. The pelts of in-land otters typically sold for around 2 to 3 [[gp]], while those of sea otters fetched prices of around 1,000 to 4,000 gp.

Otters were often hunted down and fed upon by [[orpsu]].
