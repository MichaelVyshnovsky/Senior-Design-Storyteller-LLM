        "mainbody": "The '''Statue of Talos''' was an animated statue depicting the Storm Lord [[Talos]], located in the [[Wayside Inn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The big statue of Talos was made of [[copper]]. It was shaped like a four-armed storm deity with lightning bolts in each hand.",
        "Abilities": "The statue was able to fly and perceive its surroundings in the dark.",
        "Combat": "The statue attacked with each of its lightning bolt blades and headbutted its opponent.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Wayside Inn was taken over by the [[Cult of Talos]]. One of the cultists, the blacksmith [[Teega]], animated the statue of Talos in the cellar, as part of a ritual to turn the inn into a temple of Talos and gain control over the weather in the region. The statue was magically connected to Teega's life force via her bracers. A group of [[adventurers]] was able to stop the ritual in time, destroying the statue of Talos and defeating Teega and her allies."
