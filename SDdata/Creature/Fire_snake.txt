Fire snakes were the larval form of salamanders.
A fire snake resembled a snake about  long, with scales that ranged from blood-red to orange.
Fire snakes were only barely more intelligent than an animal, and with about as many opinions.
Fire snakes were, naturally, immune to fire. They also had mild paralyzing venom.
Every ten years, a salamander laid a single egg that hatched into a fire snake. Fire snakes lived in deep pits on the Elemental Plane of Fire, where they were often tended by flamebrother salamanders. Some of these beings remained as fire snakes their entire lives, while others would metamorph into flamebrothers.
Fire snakes were known to keep gems as treasure.
During the Era of Upheaval, fire snakes were known to dwell within plane of Heliopolis.
