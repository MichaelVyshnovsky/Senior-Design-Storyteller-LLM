'''Fire snakes''' were the larval form of [[salamander]]s.

==Description==
A fire snake resembled a snake about {{SIrange|2|3|ft}} long, with scales that ranged from blood-red to orange.

==Behavior==
Fire snakes were only barely more intelligent than an animal, and with about as many opinions.

==Abilities==
Fire snakes were, naturally, immune to fire. They also had mild paralyzing venom.

==Ecology==
Every ten years, a salamander laid a single egg that hatched into a fire snake.<ref> Fire snakes lived in deep pits on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], where they were often tended by [[flamebrother salamander]]s. Some of these beings remained as fire snakes their entire lives, while others would metamorph into flamebrothers.<ref>

Fire snakes were known to keep gems as treasure.

==History==
During the [[Era of Upheaval]], fire snakes were known to dwell within plane of [[Heliopolis]].
