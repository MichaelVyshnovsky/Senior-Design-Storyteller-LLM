Demonweb terrors were a species of monstrously sized spider native to the Demonweb Pits of Lolth.
These creatures had a poisonous bite, but could also spray their venom at prey.
Demonweb terrors would use their webs to immobilize prey as they moved around and made bite attacks. Once a victim was slain, they were not above retreating with the corpse to feast upon it.
Though native to the Demonweb Pits, over time these creatures managed to find their way into the Elemental Chaos and the Prime Material plane.
These creatures were capable of speaking Abyssal.
These creatures were sometimes seen in the company of driders.
