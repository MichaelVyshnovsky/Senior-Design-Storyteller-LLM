A '''paleocinthus''', also known as '''paleoscincus''', was a species of [[dinosaur]].

==Description==
The paleocinthus looked like its cousin, the [[ankylosaurus]]. Their body was covered in thick bony armor. Sharp spikes extended from both sides of their body. Their armored tail ended in a cluster of sharp, bony spikes. 

==Combat==
Due to their natural armor, the paleocinthus was almost invulnerable to most non-magical attacks. Their sharp spines provided them with amble defensive abilities.

==Behaviour==
The paleocinthus was normally docile but became aggressive if bothered or startled.

==Ecology==
Paleocinthus were obligate herbivores and were solitary creatures.

===Habitats===
In [[Kara-Tur]], paleocinthus could be found in the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/On the Lookout!|6-7}}
