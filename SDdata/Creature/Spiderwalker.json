        "mainbody": "Spiderwalkers were a type of construct created by practitioners of hishna from the bodies of dried tarantulas.\nSpiderwalkers could be given very specific instructions, but only by those who knew their command word. They could be directed to strike at a certain individual, or to fight as many of a certain type as they could encounter.\nThese constructs had a poisonous bite. They were capable of springing up to  into the air and could survive falls of any height, landing with great accuracy.\nSpiderwalkers could only be activated at night time and when the first rays of the sun arose they would cease to function, even if the sun was concealed by clouds or the spiderwalker was indoors or underground."
