        "mainbody": "'''Snyads''', also known as '''pesties''', were a wingless species of [[gremlin]] distantly related to [[jermlaine]]s and [[mite]]s.",
        "Description": "On average, snyads grew to be {{SI|2.5|ft|long=yes}} tall. They had [[humanoid]] bodies, light brown in coloration, resembling that of a mite, but standing taller and sporting full, messy heads of hair. And like all gremlins, they had large pointed ears.",
        "Personality": "Snyads had a great love for treasure, which they acted on compulsively.",
        "Abilities": "These creatures were incredibly fast, silent, and quick in their reflexes. They surprised their targets the majority of the time and were skilled at snatching items right out of their very hands. However, they were not particularly strong.",
        "Combat": "Snyads were rather risk averse, avoiding physical combat whenever possible and relying on their quick reflexes to make quick getaways. If captured they would kick, scream, and squirm, but fearfully would never bite their captor.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Snyads lived within the [[Upperdark]]. There they lived similarly to their gremlin cousins, the jermlaine and mite, in that their lairs were maze-like systems of tiny chambers and passageways along major trade routes, allowing them to prey upon unwary travelers. The entrances to their tunnels were small and usually concealed behind piles of loose stone.",
            "Languages": "It was unknown if these creatures spoke any language, but they were observed communicating quite well with mites.",
            "Relationships": "Snyads typically left their lairs to steal small items of treasure from [[demihuman]] and [[human]] passersby, such as [[gemstone]]s or [[jewelry]], sometimes or often times acting in cooperation with mites. Their quick speed complimented the latter's skills in traps, who distracted the targets as the snyads swooped in to steal their goods.\n\nThey sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of [[Brandobaris]].",
            "Usages": "About {{SI|1|oz|long=yes}} of snyad blood could be used as an ingredient for [[potion of diminution|''potions of diminution'']].{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|40}}"
        },
        "History": "Following its destruction, snyads could be found in the ruins of [[Zhentil Keep]].<ref>"
