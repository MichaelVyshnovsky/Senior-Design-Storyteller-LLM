        "Description": "Wereworgs were [[evil]] lycanthropes. Anyone who was bitten by a [[lycanthropy|lycanthropic]] worg was automatically infected with lycanthropy, unless they quickly addressed the wound. The wounds had to be treated with [[belladonna]] or via [[divine magic]], such as a ''[[cure disease]]'' spell. If the wounds were not treated, the infected would involuntarily turn into a wereworg during the next full moon.\n\nUpon becoming a wereworg, the infected would also become evil, no matter their previous alignment. They would have urges to attack others, including their friends and companions. After some time had passed, nothing short of a ''[[wish]]'' spell could transform them to their former selves.",
        "History": "In the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, cultists of [[Orcus]] wished to take revenge for the defeat of high [[priest]] [[Banak]] by [[adventurer]]s in [[Bloodstone Village]]. Accordingly, Orcus' minions started to spread this form of lycanthropy to the [[Galena Mountains]], which brought much chaos to the region."
