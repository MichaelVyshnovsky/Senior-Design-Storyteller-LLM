        "mainbody": "Starsnakes were beautiful, solitary creatures, that repelled magic as they slept and delighting in playing pranks on intelligent creatures.\nThe star snake had a coat of glossy, shimmering scales of blue, green and red with iridescent, silk-like wings that resembled those of a butterfly. Even though they averaged about 8 to 10 feet in length, they typically weighed under 10 lbs.  Like with many other snakes, starsnakes had transparent eyelids that gave a false impression that they never slept. Their sky-colored eyes had vertical reptilian pupils. Starsnakes voice sounded like a dry whisper, when they communicated in Common or Halruaan.\nDespite having such exotic features and remarkable qualities, starsnakes fed on simple rodents.\nThese magical creatures were hermaphroditic, which served them well as they were completely anti-social and found their own kind repellent. They would typically only be active at twilight, coming to rest in an area that was well traveled by intelligent life. They were pranksters, planting ridiculous yet harmless suggestions to passerby. This behavior gave way to the phrase \"charmed by a starsnake\".\nWhen starsnakes slept, they created a dreamshield around themselves, an aura that would absorb spells and magic from abilities. This energy was converted to electricity, and any creature foolish enough to touch a sleeping starsnake would receive a static discharge.\nStarsnakes were considered strong and, when witnessed in battle, fearsome. The creatures inhabited the skies of Halruaa, and were occasionally summoned by Halruaan mages. Massive bilboa tree trunks were a common sleeping spot for the snakes.\nHalruaan sages believed that starsnakes sleeping defenses evolved over a course of several centuries via adaptation to their magic-filled environment. Their most dangerous predator was a Halruaan wizard. These dreamshields or sleep shields were unaffected by any attempts to negate or dispel them. Many humorous tavern tales in Halruaa told of unfortunate wizards who did try and fail. These dreamshields also served as passive means of nourishment. When the magics of the shield were discharged, there was a good chance it awoken the starsnake. The creatures rose to a cooked and ready meal.\nSkin of a starsnake was quite valuable and could be sold for a handful of skie. It was especially sought after by alchemists, potion-makers, and practicing mages. Starsnake meat was edible, but unpalatable and bitter."
