        "Description": "Swarmhorde spiders were a relatively small variety of giant spider with brown exoskeletons that resembled dead forest leaves. They were small and slow but, as the name suggests, swarmhorde spiders hunted in overwhelming swarms.",
        "Combat": "The spiders tracked their victims via [[tremorsense]] and attacked their prey by biting them and injecting them with [[poison]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of swarmhorde spiders were found infesting the King's Forest during the [[Darkening]] and found hunting in the Underdark areas underneath the forest, as well as within the [[Haunted Halls]]."
