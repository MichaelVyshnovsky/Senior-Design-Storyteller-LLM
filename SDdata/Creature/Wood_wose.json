        "mainbody": "'''Nightshades''', also known as '''wood woses''', were elemental spirits of poisonous plants, such as [[foxglove]].",
        "Description": "Nightshades appeared as stocky, dark-brown-skinned [[fey]] [[dwarf|dwarves]], with thick beards and thatch-like hair full of plants. Their garb consisted of woven fiber kilts and vests.",
        "Personality": "Nightshades were described as cold and uncaring.",
        "Combat": "Nightshades were poisonous to the touch, creating a painful stinging sensation on contact. Using their [[bronze]] or [[copper]] [[spear]]s and [[short sword]]s covered in their sap, nightshades tried to kill their opponents by poison, as victims slain in this manner would sprout as a new nightshade when next [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]] was full. Some nightshades were [[druid]]ic mages, and large groups could summon and command [[shambling mound]]s once monthly.",
        "Society": "Instead of [[currency]] and [[gem]]s, nightshades valued [[potion]]s and [[poison]]s, the latter of which they traded with [[quickling]]s in exchange for weaponry.\n\nNightshades were the enemies of [[treant]]s, druids, and [[ranger]]s. Among their allies were the [[korred]], [[needlefolk]], and evil [[myconid]]s.",
        "Notable": "Ruling over the nightshades through terror and blackmail was high queen [[Ainecotte]], the eldest and smartest of their kin."
