'''Stoats''' were a species of mustelid or "weasel", a family of small mammals that included [[ferret]]s and [[weasel]]s.{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|17}}{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|17}}

==Description==
Like weasels, these animals were small and slender-bodied furry creatures, measuring {{SIrange|1|2|ft|long=yes}} in length from head to tail.

==Ecology==
Much like ferrets, the fur pelt of a stoat was not considered to be very valuable.
===Habitats===
In [[northwest Faerûn]], silvered fur stoats could be found in [[Hartsvale]]. Beyond [[Faerûn]], stoats inhabited the sub-arctic forests of [[Kara-Tur]].
===Relationships===
Some [[wizard]]s were known to have stoats as [[familiar]]s.
