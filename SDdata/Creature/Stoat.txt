Stoats were a species of mustelid or "weasel", a family of small mammals that included ferrets and weasels.
Like weasels, these animals were small and slender-bodied furry creatures, measuring  in length from head to tail.
Much like ferrets, the fur pelt of a stoat was not considered to be very valuable.
In northwest Faerûn, silvered fur stoats could be found in Hartsvale. Beyond Faerûn, stoats inhabited the sub-arctic forests of Kara-Tur.
Some wizards were known to have stoats as familiars.
