        "History": "Merrow were created when a tribe of merfolk found an idol to Demogorgon that drove them all insane. The king of this tribe demanded a blood sacrifice to the idol that opened a rift to the Abyss. The corrupted merfolk slowly transformed into the monsters now known as merrow over multiple generations there."
