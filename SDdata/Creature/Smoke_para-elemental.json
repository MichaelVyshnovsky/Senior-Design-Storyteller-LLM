        "mainbody": "Smoke para-elementals were a variety of para-elemental composed of smoke.\nThese types of para-elementals had mutable forms that appeared as concentrated clouds of black fog while flying through the air, often directed by any strong winds, while they appeared to be a dark sooty mass when drifting low to the ground. Some reported that these clouds had red-hot cinder eyes and arms with sickle-shaped claws.\nLike all para-elementals they were wary, cautious, and even unfriendly towards outsiders.\nSmoke para-elementals possessed a minor resistance to spells that were heat or air based, though some claimed it was an immunity, as well as attacks from fire and air elementals. When it came to weapons, they generally could only be harmed by those with a +1 or greater enchantment.\nThese para-elementals fought creatures around them in a  radius by blinding them with their smoky bodies and asphyxiating them by partially entering their enemys body. Some claimed that, once partially inhaled by their victim, a smoke para-elemental would solidify the smoke inside them into a claw or talon and begin ripping at their victims insides. Those who claimed they had claws said they also fought with these when not asphyxiating an enemy.\nLike other para-elementals, those of smoke sustained themselves by converting their elemental opposite, air, into smoke. Because of this, they could be seen frequenting the small bubbles of air that occasionally leaked into their home plane from the Elemental Plane of Air. However, if they found themselves deprived of this, they would not starve to death.\nThis variety of para-elemental was native to the Para-Elemental Plane of Smoke. There they lived divided into many small kingdoms, each ruled by a powerful \"smoke king\"\nThey could also be found on the Elemental Plane of Air and Elemental Plane of Fire, though them appearing in such elemental pockets was a rare occurrence.\nOn the Prime Material plane, they could sometimes be encountered in the deserts of Calimshan.\nSmoke para-elementals were capable of speaking both Auran and Ignan, but it always came out in a hissing and crackling voice.\nSmoke para-elementals rarely interacted with the other denizens of their plane. They had no hostility towards the smoke mephits, coexisting in peace and respect with them, even though their kingdoms often overlapped their own and they did not recognize the smoke mephit Ehkahk as the planes ruler. They shared with the smoke mephits a great enmity to towards the efreet and djinn, who often came to their plane to wage war. Attempts by either side to form alliances with the para-elementals always proved fruitless.\nThey were known to act as servants of the deity Kossuth, who would sometimes send them out to the Prime Material to do his bidding or aid his followers."
