        "Description": "These creatures varied in length from {{SIrange|15|35|ft|long=yes}}, weighed around a ton, and were covered in dark brown or grey scales. They typically had either red or orange eyes and their jaws were filled with long and sharp teeth.\n\nUnlike true dragons, wyverns only had a pair of hind legs instead of a set four. Their wingspan could get over {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} in length. And their tails were often quite long, comprising almost half of their bodies, yet very mobile. These ended in a thick cartilage knot with a stinger protruding out of it, not unlike that of a [[scorpion]].\n\nTelltale sounds that these creatures produced included loud hisses and throated growls, similar to the vocalizations of [[alligator]]s.",
        "Behavior": "Wyverns were aggressive and not greatly intelligent.Although normally depicted with only two legs, some sources, such as the [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (comic series)|ADD]] comic \"[[The Gathering]]\", show wyverns with four legs like dragons. The scorpion-like sting on the tail suggests it is in fact a wyvern.",
        "Combat": "When fighting these creatures would dive down from above, grabbing prey with their hind leg claws, and then attempt to sting them to death. They were also known to slash at creatures with their claws mid-flight. Their tails were so long that opponents were typically struck by a wyvern's tail before their legs.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Languages": "Despite their middling intelligence, wyverns were fluent speakers of [[Draconic language|Draconic]].",
            "Habitats": "These creatures were typically found in areas that were favored by dragons, such as tangled forests or large caverns.\n\nMany were known to inhabit the [[Forest of Wyrms]], as well as the [[Cloak Wood]] forest.\n\nOn the [[Chultan Peninsula]], wyverns were a common sight in the jungles of the nation of [[Samarach]].",
            "Relationships": "Wyverns were used as mounts by various races and cultures, including [[Zhentarim skymage]]s and the extradimensional marauder [[Imgig Zu]].{{Cite comic/The Gathering|3-5}}\n\nThe [[black dragon|black]] [[dracolich]] [[Hethcypressarvil]] kept a pair of wyverns as pets at his lair in the [[Nameless swamp (Dragon Coast)|nameless swamp]] of the [[Dragon Coast]].",
            "Uses": "Wyvern hide was used in the creation of bookbindings, and its blood was an ingredient in the [[belarris]] poison.\n\nThe dried blood of a wyvern was one of the components used in [[create darkenbeast]] spells.\n\nThe meat of a wyvern's tail was said to be particularly delicious, having a taste and texture reminiscent of juicy [[pork]]. Wyvern tail meat was a delicacy in [[Cormyr]] and the [[Dalelands]], served in places like the [[Old Oyster]] in [[Monksblade]], the [[Fall of Stars]] in [[Harrowdale]], and the [[Swordsmith's House]] in [[High Dale]]. As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a dish known as \"[[jack wyvern tail]]\" was served in Cormyr that was designed to mimic the flavor of real wyvern with a mixture of minced pork, [[rabbit]], and [[turkey]]."
        },
        "History": "Wyverns were created by the [[aearee]] of [[Viakoo]] in {{Yearlink|-30700}}.<ref>",
        "Cultural Significance": "Some wyverns served the dark [[Chult]]an [[demigod]] [[Eshowdow]], and their appearance was seen as a good sign by his followers.<ref>\n\n[[House Dlardrageth]], a powerful [[sun elf]] family from [[Arcorar]] that corrupted their bloodline by breeding with [[fiend]]s, used the image of a golden wyvern against three red crossed swords as their house's insignia.<ref>\n\nExpensive [[wyvern whiskey]] from [[Nimbral]] had a wyvern scale floating in every bottle.",
        "Notable Wyverns": "* [[Trill]], companion of [[Mattias Farseer]].\n* [[Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot]], a unique wyvern with two heads defeated by the hero of [[Daggerford]] and [[Talarenne]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].<ref name=\"NWN-DOD\" >\n* [[Wyvernspur (house)|Wyvernspur]] family received a magical ability to be able to transform into a wyvern. Not everyone in the family was able to channel said magic. [[Giogioni Wyvernspur|Giogi]] and [[Dorath Wyvernspur|aunt Dorath]] were the only family members in recent years able to transform using the Wyvern Spur heirloom."
