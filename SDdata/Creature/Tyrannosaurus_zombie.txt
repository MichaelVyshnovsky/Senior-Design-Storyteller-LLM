A tyrannosaurus zombie was a powerful zombie created from the corpse of a dead tyrannosaurus.
Like all zombies, tyrannosaurus zombies moved in an uneven way and smelled of decay. They often had their gullets filled with other zombies.
Like their living counterparts, tyrannosaurus zombies attacked with a powerful bite and a devastating tail. In addition, they could regurgitate a few of the smaller regular zombies contained in their gullets, although the zombies could not be controlled by the tyrannosaurus itself, and it could not do this whilst biting prey. But to make matters worse, when the tyrannosaurus zombie was destroyed, any remaining zombies in its stomach could burst free and rampage.
In the late 15 century DR, many forms of undead, including zombies and tyrannosaurus zombies, were spreading through Chult like a plague, despite efforts of the Emerald Enclave, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Flaming Fist to contain their spread. These were all part of Ras Nsis army of the undead, and were included therein by Acererak.
