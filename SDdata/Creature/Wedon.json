        "mainbody": "Wedon were a type of memedi native to Kara-Tur.\nWedon appeared as a human cloaked in a white sheet made from silk. The silken sheet covered their entire body.\nLike all common memedi, wedon were harmless and avoided all combat.\nIf a human saw a wedon, they were struck with effects similar to a fear spell.\nWedon were solitary creatures.\nWedon were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of Bawa and other islands within the Island Kingdoms.\nWedon portended death and destruction and were greatly feared by the peoples of Kara-Tur. Warning of their appearance in an area was often predicted by the sudden appearance of a flock of loons or sparrows. If the flock remained in the area or actively followed an individual, the appearance of a wedon was guaranteed. An individual who witnessed this was wise to seek out a priest and seek redemption from the gods."
