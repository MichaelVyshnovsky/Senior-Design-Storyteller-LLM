A kapoacinth () was an aquatic creature related to the gargoyle. They could not fly but instead swam, using their wings to propel them forward.
Much like standard gargoyles, a kapoacinth delighted in causing pain to other creatures. Most often humans, merfolk, and sea elves.
Kapoacinth typically lived in shallow waters, often lairing in undersea caves.
