        "mainbody": "roken ones, also known as animal men, were a variety of humanoids whose bodies had been spliced with animals through means of scientific or magical experiments gone wrong, a powerful curse, and, on rare occasions, by the Dark Powers of the Domains of Dread.\nThese creatures more or less looked human, but their bodies were warped and twisted. The non-human parts of their bodies were clearly visible to any who could see them. By their very nature, the features of a broken ones body varied by individual, however, they never displayed traits of intelligent nonhuman races. For example, those merged with a scorpion might have a chitinous shell or a poisonous stinger, while those merged with a rat might have a long whip-like tail and wiry whiskers.\nThe habits of broken ones were often dictated by whatever animal they were spliced with.\nthumb|273px|Two broken ones, displaying traits of a lion and a scorpion.\nCommon traits among broken ones were stamina greater than that of a human and a regenerative ability. Some, known as greater broken ones, were physically superior and healed at an even faster rate.\nBroken ones also had varied abilities that were derived from whatever animal they were spliced with, such as darkvision or keen hearing. The common variety of broken one generally only had one such ability, while greater broken ones exhibited anywhere from one to four unique abilities.\nBesides using their animal traits to their advantage, broken ones were known to fight with actual weaponry.\nIn the 14 century DR, the mercenary Baerduin Thask was known to have transformed his prisoners of war into broken ones.\nIn 1367 DR, just after Midsummer Night, the Kolat Towers were broken into and several spell scrolls were stolen, including ones that were inscribed with Duhlarks Animerge. This lead to an insurgence of vagrants in Waterdeep being turned into broken ones, with them occasionally being found in the sewers below.\nIn the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff encountered both common and greater broken ones in the domain of Nidala, that had all displayed the traits of a scorpion and had been created by some evil wizard that was imprisoned in the dungeon of the darklords castle. The broken ones were trying to rob a wagon of animal entrails from a slaughterhouse, fighting a bunch of ravenkin that were guarding it, before the adventurers intervened.\nThese creatures were typically reclusive, but sought out their own kind. Whenever a society of them was found, it was of a tribal nature and consisted of ten to sixty broken ones of the common variety. There was often a greater broken one in these societies who acted as their leader. These societies did manufacture their own items for the purpose of survival, but they would be of no interest to outsiders.\nWhen possible, broken ones would seek out the ones responsible for their creation and try to destroy them.\nThe dietary nature of broken ones varied depending upon whatever animal they were spliced with. Some could be strict carnivores, while others were herbivores.\nBroken ones typically dwelled in secluded areas far from human societies, such as in dense woods or rocky wastes.\nBroken ones typically spoke whatever languages they knew prior to their transformation, in some limited capacity. Due to their deformities, it was not uncommon for them to speak in a heavily accented or slurred manner. A small number of them were also capable of speaking with whatever animal they had been spliced with.\nBroken ones occasionally attacked human caravans or villages. This was typically out of self-defense, a need for supplies, or simply a desire for vengeance for some wrong. Sometimes evil sages or wizards would capture broken ones to study them.\n* Bloirt Waelarn was transformed by an archmage into what could be considered a broken one.Prayers from the Faithful described Bloirt as having been transformed into something \"akin to a mongrelman\", rather than simply stating that he had been transformed into one, and the closest thing akin to mongrelfolk in 2 edition would be broken ones.\nAccording to rumors, some broken ones were the results of failed attempts at the spells polymorph, reincarnate, and resurrection."
