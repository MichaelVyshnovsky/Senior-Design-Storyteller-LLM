Rokuro-kubi () were a race of evil humanoid creatures native to Kara-Tur.
Rokuro-kubi outwardly resembled a human. The main distinguishing feature was their neck. They had the ability to stretch their neck up to  in length. Their mouths were filled with fangs.
Rokuro-kubi were cunning and mischievous. They took great pleasure in the suffering of other creatures. 
Rokuro-kubi used humanoid weapons in melee combat. They would also use their sharp fangs to bite an opponent. Their neck was strong enough to be able to constrict an opponent, but this was a rare attack, since a rokuro-kubi had to focus all its concentration on one opponent.  
Rokuro-kubi were solitary creatures. They had a nomadic lifestyle, roaming from village to village. They were most often found in the nations of Kozakura and Wa.
A tribe of rokuro-kubi occupied the Jufosu Range of mountains in the southern end of Tsukishima in Wa. They took victims from the farming villages in the foothills of those mountains.
