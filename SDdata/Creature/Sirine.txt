'''Sirines''' ({{Pronounce|sy|REENZ|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) were playful, fun-loving, aquatic [[fey]] creatures who loved to sing and dance.

==Description==
Sirines looked like normal [[human]] females although their skin might have a yellow or greenish tinge to it. Their hair varied from normal human colors to silver or dark green.

==Combat==
Sirines preferred not to engage in direct combat. Rather, they tended to use their abilities to escape back to their home. Sirines could [[charm]] another creature and could damage their foes' intelligence. Some sirines used [[bow]]s, [[sling]]s or [[javelin]]s as weapons and a small number carried [[magic]]al javelins.

A single touch from a sirine had a chance of instantly reducing the target's intelligence. This effect lasted until dispelled with magic, or until any sirine touched the victim again.

==Society==
They often frolicked with strangers, although only for a short amount of time and almost never invited strangers back to their lair.
===Homelands===
In the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] they were known to be prevalent around [[Thesk]] and [[Altumbel]]. Small families were known to live within the [[Mountains of Volar]] alongside [[storm giant]]s. They were also known to inhabit the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]] and the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Notable Sirines==
* In the city of [[Calimport]], there lived a sirine in the [[Festhall of Eternal Delight]] who was magically able to breathe air indefinitely.<ref>
* [[Larriaz]], a sirine on the [[Sword Coast]] who was captured by a group of fisherman in [[1368 DR]] and brought back to their home in [[Baldur's Gate]].
* [[Meiala]], a sirine [[adventurer]] who became [[petrified]] in the depths of [[Durlag's Tower]] and was later freed by [[Gorion's Ward]].
* [[Sil]], the leader of a small tribe of sirines in the Sword Coast.
