Sirines () were playful, fun-loving, aquatic fey creatures who loved to sing and dance.
Sirines looked like normal human females although their skin might have a yellow or greenish tinge to it. Their hair varied from normal human colors to silver or dark green.
Sirines preferred not to engage in direct combat. Rather, they tended to use their abilities to escape back to their home. Sirines could charm another creature and could damage their foes intelligence. Some sirines used bows, slings or javelins as weapons and a small number carried magical javelins.
A single touch from a sirine had a chance of instantly reducing the targets intelligence. This effect lasted until dispelled with magic, or until any sirine touched the victim again.
They often frolicked with strangers, although only for a short amount of time and almost never invited strangers back to their lair.
In the Sea of Fallen Stars they were known to be prevalent around Thesk and Altumbel. Small families were known to live within the Mountains of Volar alongside storm giants. They were also known to inhabit the Moonsea lake and the Sea of Swords.
