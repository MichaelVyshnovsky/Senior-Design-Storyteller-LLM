        "mainbody": "Qorrash () were genies of cold and ice.\nQorrash were elemental creatures native to the Plane of Air. They had blue skin, which was always covered in thick frost, because a perpetual aura of bitter cold always emanated from their bodies. They had white hair. Males were often bald and sported fancy goatees females wore their hair long. A typical qorrashi stood over ten feet (300 centimeters) tall and weighed about half a ton.\nQorrash had such a strong connection to ice that they could walk on any surface of ice&mdasheven upside down. Like other genies, they had a wide assortment of inherent magical powers, including but not limited to the ability to turn invisible, to summon a storm of ice, to turn into a gaseous form, and to walk on the wind. A qorrashi could create food and water and other items and generate powerful illusions. They could blast a cone of cold from their palms, and anyone struck by one of their blows would suffer a severe chill that could lead to frostbite.\nLike all genies, qorrashi had darkvision and could plane shift to the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Prime.\nQorrash usually spoke Auran, Celestial, Common, and Ignan. They were also telepathic.\nQorrashi enjoyed fighting more than djinn did. They were confident in battle, yet they still used their magic to weaken their foes from a distance before closing in. If badly injured, they were not too proud to retreat.\nThe qorrash were distantly related to the djinn.\nQorrash shared a special relationship in the governance of the ancient giants of the Jhothûn Empire.\n* The last Prince of Jhothûn"
