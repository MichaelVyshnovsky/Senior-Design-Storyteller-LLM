A '''''ceramic golem''''' was a type of mineral [[golem]] that was formed from various pieces of [[ceramic]] pottery stacked together.

==Description==
From afar, it looked like a pile of broken pottery, being whatever ceramic items they were made of. These items were put into the shape of a [[humanoid]] and animated.

==Combat==
Because of the brittleness of ceramic pottery, such golems were especially vulnerable to [[weapon]] attacks. These constructs attacked with their jagged edges. Their fist strikes were strong enough to create concussions and they could charge opponents, albeit clumsily.
