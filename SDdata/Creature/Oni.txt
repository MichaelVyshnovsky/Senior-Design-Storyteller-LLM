'''Oni''' ({{Pronounce|oh|nee|refs=}}) were violent [[spirit]] creatures with great strength and inherent magical abilities, prevalent in the eastern lands of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Abilities==
Besides great strength, many oni had regenerative abilities similar to [[troll]]s, and all oni had multiple magical abilities, including the ability to [[fly]] without wings, [[Polymorph|change their own shape]], and [[Invisibility|turn themselves invisible]].

===Subraces===
There were many varieties of oni. The most common were:
; [[Common oni]] : The most common and weakest variety. The "[[ogre mage]]" of the west was in fact a blue-skinned variety of the common oni.
; [[Go-zu oni]] : This was a bull-headed variety of oni.
; [[Me-zu oni]] : These oni had heads like those of shaggy horses.

==Personality==
Oni enjoyed both dancing and music. They particularly enjoyed the music of flutes. It was considered unwise to interrupt an oni dancing celebration!

Among animals, oni preferred black-colored ones.

Oni also were very fond of treasures of all varieties. Some oni would swallow their treasures to protect them, regurgitating them later.

==Society==
Oni often lived in desolate areas, or they might make homes along highways or within cities, living in disguise. In rare cases, they might even rule over small [[human]] villages.

A band of oni might contain a hundred members, in obedience to the largest and wisest oni, whether male or female. They might be found allied with [[bakemono]], [[gaki]], [[goblin rat]]s, or varieties of evil [[humanoid]]s.

===Language===
Oni had their [[Oni language|own language]], but spoke other languages as well.

==Ecology==
Oni were carnivorous and had massive appetites. They ate both wild game and domesticated animals, and would eat humanoids as well.

Males and females were equally powerful.

==History==
The origin of oni remained a mystery to scholars. Many believed that they were the corrupted spirits of evil humans, but others thought them to have been created specifically by the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] to test humans and establish a balance between good and evil.{{Cite dragon/349/Ecology of the Ogre Mage|68-72}} or that oni were related to trolls. Other sages told the tale that oni were descended from the god [[Vaprak]]'s three sons, [[Anori]], [[Hakuni]], and [[Muaj]].

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that an island populated almost exclusively by oni was said to exist somewhere in the [[Celestial Sea]], but if true, no human explorer had ever found the island and returned. Strangely, the island was said to be guarded by thousands of one-foot tall black oni with powers as great as larger oni.

It was rumored that [[amethyst]]s could repel oni.
