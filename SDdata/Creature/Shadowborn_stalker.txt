A '''shadowborn stalker''' was a [[humanoid]] who had undergone a radical transformation into a creature suffused with the power of the [[Shadowfell]].

==Description==
The transformation turned the humanoid's skin to a pale gray, their hair to pure black, and their eyes to pupil-less white. The power of the Shadowfell embedded itself into both their body and [[soul]], and created a sinister aura of shadow around them.

==Abilities==
Shadowborn stalkers gained [[darkvision]] as well as the abilities to turn [[Invisibility|invisible]] or to create a {{SIAdj|5|foot|adj=radius}} zone of [[darkness|magical darkness]] for a few seconds whenever they wished.

==Society==
Becoming a shadowborn stalker required striking a bargain with the [[Dark Powers|powers of the Shadowfell]] to access the forbidden lore and dark [[ritual]]s that enabled the transformation. The most likely individuals to pursue this path included [[assassin]]s, [[thieves]], and [[warlock]]s&mdash;especially among [[goblin]]s, [[drow]], and [[Shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]]&mdash;who favored stealthy approaches to their problems.

==Notable Shadowborn Stalkers==
* [[Wei Chiang]], a merchant and [[drug]] smuggler active in [[Westgate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Crafts|15}}
