'''Stink beetles''' were a species of [[beetle|giant beetle]] that could produce miasmal stench in self-defense.

==Description==
Stink beetles looked similar to other giant beetles. Their main distinction was their horn, used in combat and presumably mating rituals, as well as their green compound eyes. Out of all beetle species, they were said to most resemble the [[slicer beetle]].

==Behavior==
These creatures often acted in a similar manner to slicer beetles. They would attack anything that provoked them or that they identified as prey.

==Combat==
Stink beetles' main combat ability was emitting a noxious gas that could render their opponents unconscious. That ability was akin to the ''[[stinking cloud]]'' spell. Once the attacker was on the ground, the beetle proceeded to attack, slashing with its horn. Upon death, the beetle's poison gas glands discharged one last time, affecting everyone within {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} from the dying insect.

They were immune to mind-affecting smells as well as the ''stinking cloud''.

==Ecology==
Stink beetles were somewhat uncommon creatures, found only in a handful of underground and swamp locations around [[Neverwinter]]. These foul-smelling insects were carriers of the [[vermin madness]] disease.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], these bugs infested the underground tunnel between [[Lady Tanglebrook]]'s house and the [[Neverwinter Prison|city prison]] in the [[Peninsula District (Neverwinter)|Peninsula district]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The same year wizardÂ [[Meldanen]] from the [[Blacklake District]] of Neverwinter, had stink beetles, along with other tamed creatures, within his spacious mansion.

After the Wailing Death plague of 1372 DR, Spindrift Town's sewers were home to spindriftian stink beetles.
