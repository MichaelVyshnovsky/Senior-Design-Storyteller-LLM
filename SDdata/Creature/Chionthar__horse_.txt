{{Otheruses|Chionthar (disambiguation)}}
The '''Chionthar''', also known as the '''Reaching''' or '''Cormyte riding horse''', was a popular light [[horse|steed]] from the [[Chionthar Valley]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Although they were most commonly found in their home region, they were also abundantly bred in the [[Eastern Heartlands]].

Highly valued by travelers and couriers, especially for their easy-to-train temperament. The Chionthar could be bought from quality ranchers in a number of cities including [[Arabel]], [[Harrowdale]] and [[Waymoot]] in [[Interior Faerûn|central]] [[Faerûn]], or [[Asbravn]], [[Hluthvar]] and [[Iriaebor]] in the Western Heartlands. The average price for a steed was 200 [[gp]].

==Description==
This breed was particularly strong and swift for its size. It had a long neck and regal-looking head with a face and eyes that exhibited notable intelligence.

==History==
The Chionthar was originally bred in the [[Vilhon Reach]], influenced heavily by its [[Calimite]] and [[Dambraii]] forebears. Despite their origins on the southern coasts of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], the Chionthar was perfected as a breed in [[Cormyr]].
