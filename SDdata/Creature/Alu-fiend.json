        "mainbody": "Alu-fiends () were the product of successful procreation between a succubus and a male mortal (usually human). The male equivalent to an alu-fiend was generally called a cambion. Successive offspring from either (with mortals) were demonic tieflings.\nFemales were, generally, attractive or beautiful, going to great lengths at times to conceal their needle-like teeth and diminutive wings. They often possessed a high degree of sexual proclivity. Males, however, were harder to distinguish, as its \"cousin\", the cambion (produced from a female mortal), possessed many of the same \"abyssal\" traits. This led to a diminishing use of the patrilineal- and matrilineal-influenced terms as a whole rather, products of both partnerings were considered \"half-fiend\".\nAlu-fiends were known to serve the goddess of bad luck Beshaba, with two of the winged creatures being among the deitys closest attendants.\nthumb|A woodcut depicting an alu-fiend and a knight.\n* Aliisza\n* Anderia and Estellia, the alu-fiend allies of the nabassu Viscaris\nThough apparently not the daughter of a succubus, Grazzts daughter Thraxxia appeared in the form of an alu-fiend."
