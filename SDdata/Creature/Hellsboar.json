        "mainbody": "Hellsboars were a species of semi-intelligent fiends that resembled ordinary boars of the Prime Material plane.\nThese boar-like fiends moved on four hoofed legs. Their stout and powerful bodies were covered in red leather with obsidian-black bony protrusions on their joints, along the spines, covering their heads, with large jagged bone spikes growing out of their shoulder blades. Hellsboars black bony heads resembled skulls with small eyes and maws glowing with hellfire from the inside. Two forward-facing horns pointed forward from their snouts.\nLesser hellsboars were medium-sized creatures that weighted  on average.\nthumb|A vengeful hellsboar variety.|300x300px\nIn battle, hellsboars relied on brute strength, charging at their prey horns first. The creatures possessed darkvision.\nHellsboars were known to serve stronger fiends in the battles of the Blood War, alongside Zariels cambions and imps.\nIn the , Zariels hellish forces attacked a plane-hopping nautiloid that served the Cult of the Absolute. Aboard, cambions, imps, and hellsboars, under the command of Commander Zhalk faced illithid forces and surviving group of True Soul adventurers who broke out after being captured on Toril."
