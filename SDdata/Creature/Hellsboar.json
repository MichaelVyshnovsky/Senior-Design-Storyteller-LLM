        "Description": "These boar-like fiends moved on four hoofed legs. Their stout and powerful bodies were covered in red leather with obsidian-black bony protrusions on their joints, along the spines, covering their heads, with large jagged bone spikes growing out of their shoulder blades. Hellsboars' black bony heads resembled skulls with small eyes and maws glowing with hellfire from the inside. Two forward-facing horns pointed forward from their snouts.\n\nLesser hellsboars were medium-sized creatures that weighted {{SI|143.3|lb|k|long=yes}} on average.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Vengeful hellsboar.png|thumb|''A vengeful hellsboar variety.''|300x300px]]\nIn battle, hellsboars relied on brute strength, charging at their prey horns first. The creatures possessed ''[[darkvision]]''.",
        "Ecology": "Hellsboars were known to serve stronger fiends in the battles of the [[Blood War]], alongside [[Zariel]]'s [[cambion]]s and [[imp]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zariel's hellish forces attacked a plane-hopping ''[[nautiloid]]'' that served the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Aboard, cambions, imps, and hellsboars, under the command of Commander [[Zhalk]] faced [[illithid]] forces and surviving group of [[True Soul]] adventurers who broke out after being captured on [[Toril]]."
