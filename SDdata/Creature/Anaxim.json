        "Description": "The anaxims did not have a definite form. They were a conglomerate of metallic parts jutting with too many cutting implements and rusted surfaces.{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|51}} While no two anaxims were exactly alike, these creatures were classified in broad types, such as the \"hounds\" (that looked like [[dog]]s) or the \"maulers\" (that were [[humanoid]] in appearance).",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "Anaxims were encountered exclusively in the Glaur Barrens, an inhospitable region north of the kingdom of Gontal. There were sections of the ancient fortress of [[Glaur]] that were infested with anaxims. Explorers called this the \"Dominion of the Mindless\"."
        },
        "History": "Anaxims were faulty creations of deities of the [[Forge domain|forge]]. Unlike most other [[abomination]]s, they were carefully constructed instead of spontaneously created out of rage or lust. Yet, their designs still conveyed a sense of apocalyptic intent.\n\nThe exact origin of the Glaur Barren anaxims was not known to the few [[Abeir]]an sages and [[druid]]s who studied the creatures. The [[primordial]] [[Nehushta]] was credited as their creator.{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|51}}",
        "Notable Anaxims": "A few unique anaxims had existed for hundreds of years. Some speculated they were actually intelligent although still dangerous to all living beings. Among the known ones were:\n\n* The [[Iron Worm]]\n* The [[Mother Mauler]]"
