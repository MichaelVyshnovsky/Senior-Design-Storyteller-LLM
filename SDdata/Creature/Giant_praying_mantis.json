        "mainbody": "Giant praying mantises, also called gargantuan praying mantises, were larger versions of praying mantises.\nGiant praying mantises, like their smaller cousins, were camouflaged to look like the leaves of plants.\nThese carnivorous insects could stand motionless, hidden in foliage, until they struck out silently on approaching prey. They gripped their prey tightly in their claws and then bit down with their mandibles.\nIn Faerûn they could be found in the forest of Cormanthor. Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in parts of Kara-Tur. \nBeyond Toril, they were among the most dangerous predators of equatorial Karpri.\nThe gargantuan praying mantises of Cormanthor were the primary predators of the forests giant stag beetles."
