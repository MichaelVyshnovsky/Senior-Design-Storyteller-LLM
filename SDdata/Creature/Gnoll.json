        "Personality": "{{Quote|Trying to talk to a gnoll is the quickest path to its stomach.|[[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo's]] notes in ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]''.}}\n\nMore so than many other humanoid races, primal instinct was a strong part of the gnoll psyche. Gnolls were natural predators and savored the thrills of the hunt. Almost all gnolls preferred the wilderness to the civilized enclaves favored by humans, [[Dwarf domain|dwarves]], or other similar races and those that do take to cities have usually thought of them as just another kind of landscape.\n\nMany other races  found the gnoll psyche feral and aggressive, male and female equally,{{Cite dragon/367/Playing Gnolls|50}} A gnoll was more likely to demand answers than to ask a question. Gnolls, however, did not see this as an act of hostility, but a basic demonstration of strength.\n\nThough gnolls were not necessarily evil, the craving for the hunt and primal bloodlust that inhabited the gnoll's mind made many of the race lean towards a [[chaotic evil]] alignment by reflex. Gnolls that succumbed to this tendency often became nomadic savages, wreaking havoc wherever they could, giving them their fearsome reputation as slaving brigands throughout the world. Fortunately, such creatures were rarely seen united and, although gnolls as a whole have had a strong affinity for family and blood ties, this friendliness was not often extended to those who belonged to a different pack; the race has commonly made war on itself.{{Cite dragon/367/Playing Gnolls|48}} Some gnolls could suffer from a rare form of madness that could quell their intense hunger and evil instincts, causing guilt for their misdeeds and a pacifistic nature. \n\nOther gnoll practices might have seemed equally strange, such as the gnoll propensity for scavenging. At its most basic level, this tendency led many gnolls to collect trophies that remind them of past victories, items sometimes grisly though just as often simple and mundane.{{Cite dragon/367/Playing Gnolls|50-51}}\n\n[[File:Gnoll attack.jpg|thumb|230x230px|''Gnolls in the middle of razing a village to the ground.'']]\nThis tendency led to the even more alien gnoll practice of carrion-eating. Unlike most races, gnolls had few, if any, qualms about eating the dead of other races. When gnolls struck a village, they did not only leave no survivors but no ''corpses'', eating most of those whom they did not take as slaves. There were even indications that some gnolls took this practice a step further, raiding graveyards for fresh corpses on which to feed.",
        "Combat": "Gnolls were often known to fight with [[battleaxe]]s, [[great bow]]s, [[morningstar]]s, various types of [[pole arm]]s, and [[two-handed sword]]s.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Gnolls were generally known to live in warm plains, though they were highly adaptable and could be found living in most regions, sometimes even underground. They were less common in arid and arctic regions.",
            "Culture": "In spite of the savage nature of the gnolls, there were some aspects of their culture that were not inherently repulsive. Gnolls placed a very strong value on the family, for instance, respecting blood ties perhaps more than any other aspect of a relationship. Though gnolls within a pack commonly fought with each other for dominance, these battles were quickly forgotten after their resolution, and in most situations, gnolls of the same bloodline were loyal friends and allies to one another. These bloodlines were almost always traced maternally, through the female line.\n\nThis loyalty to family was particularly obvious during combat, either with rival gnoll packs or other races. Gnolls who fought side by side regularly threw away personal glory in order to help their brethren. Perhaps most surprisingly, when a gnoll has been separated from clan and family their instinctive need for such blood ties has led them to form a surrogate \"pack\" from those whom they choose to befriend. To these unlikely allies, the gnoll has been as loyal and faithful as they would their own brothers or sisters, embracing the outsiders as if they were family.\n\nSome gnoll societies were patriarchal and led by a chieftain, the biggest and strongest of the tribe. Chieftains were known to keep harems and as gnolls bred for fieriness, the harem-wives were the strongest fighters among other males and females, second in war-strength only to the chieftain.\n\nThe scavenging of wild gnolls rose to entirely new levels as well. While all gnolls had an innate tendency for collecting souvenirs and trophies, nomadic packs, particularly the savage ones who have had little contact with other races except during wartime, have found few other ways to acquire technology, having crafted few tools of their own. The result of this is that most gnolls relied on the other races as their source of wealth and technology. This extends to arms and weaponry, giving gnoll armor a unique aesthetic where each suit is typically made kitbashed together from scavenged pieces of armor found either on victims or abandoned.{{Cite dragon/367/Playing Gnolls|50}}\n\nGnolls of all kinds have found an affinity for hyenas, whom many see as their brethren and whom they have kept as pets or for hunting. Besides hyenas, they were known to keep [[hyaenodon]]s as pets.",
            "Religion": "[[File:Gnolls summoning dretches..png|thumb|300px|''Gnolls would sometimes summon demons to fight alongside them.'']]\nGnolls were most often worshipers of the [[demon lord]] [[Yeenoghu]], who some claim created them. Though some paid only nominal reverence, many gnolls were fanatically devoted to their dark overlord, his influence having been the primary cause of their savagery. Some gnolls believed it was their purpose as Yeenoghu's servants to cleanse the weak from the world, serving a higher purpose through the slaughter they had spread. \n\nIn spite of their devotion to Yeenoghu, few gnolls had any interest in ritual and there were few [[cleric]]s or [[shaman]]s to be found among the savage packs. Typically, gnolls saw their very brutality as a sign of their devotion to the demon lord, painting the eye of Yeenoghu onto their weapons and armor and howling his name as a war cry in battle.\n\nGnolls venerated Yeenoghu by celebrating their victories with demonic rituals and blood offerings. Occasionally, Yeenoghu rewarded such a celebrant by allowing the gnoll to be possessed by a demonic spirit, marking them as one of his chosen. Such gnolls were known as [[Fang of Yeenoghu|fangs of Yeenoghu]]. Hyenas that feasted upon the slain foe of one of the Fangs were transformed into full-grown gnolls, allowing fangs to quickly increase their population.<ref>\n\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 300px\n| source = [[Elminster]]\n| text   = Gnolls are driven by bloodlust.

        "History": "From Year of the Fanged Beast, 640 DR, the tribes following Yeenoghu in the Shaar were emboldened to attack the region around [[Lake Lhespen]] with their newly acquired shamanistic power.\n\nBy [[1340 DR]], a tribe of gnolls took over the [[Cadorna Textile House]] in then-ruined and monster-infested [[Old Phlan]]. The tribe was led by a chieftain and his three wives.\n\nBy [[1362 DR]] [[Maligor]], the Zulkir of Alteration in [[Thay]] amassed a significant army of gnolls that were trained by [[Asp (spirit naga)|Asp]] attracting the attention of Harpers, other zulkirs, and neighboring countries. Maligor targeted the up and coming Red Wizard [[Rembert Wellford]] as a ploy to distract his opponent Szass Tam from the real target. The Zulkir of Alteration sent out his gnoll army to march on Rembert's territory promising the half of the land to Szass Tam who very likely was going to take the entire territory for himself before the gnoll army was to arrive.",
