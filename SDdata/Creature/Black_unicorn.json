        "mainbody": "'''Black unicorns''' were [[unicorn]]s who had been corrupted with the blood of [[demon]]s and other [[fiend]]s. They were known to live in [[Thay]].",
        "Description": "Black unicorns had coal-black fur and silky manes. Their eyes could be glossy black or burning red. Their distinctive spiraled horns were long and chased with silver. Unlike normal unicorns, they had the sharp teeth of a carnivore.\n\nLike regular unicorns, stallions and mares could be told apart in the stallions had small beards and mares were more slender; unlike regular unicorns, mares had the same heavier musculature.",
        "Behavior": "Black unicorns were crazed, hateful creatures that lived for violence. They delighted in causing pain and suffering and preferred to eat their meals alive. When wild, they enjoyed inflicting pain on anyone and everything around them for no reason other than the sheer joy of it. They especially hated horses and normal unicorns.\n\nHowever, they were also chaotic, fickle, and concerned for their own safety; it was not unknown for them to flee when the tide of battle turned against them.",
        "Abilities": "Black unicorns, like their more peaceful kin, had multiple magical abilities. Like all unicorns, they could not be magically charmed or held and were immune to poison and death spells. They continually radiated ''[[Silence, 15' radius|silence]]'' in a {{SIAdj|15|ft}} radius around them. Three times per day, they could turn ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'', or radiate ''[[Darkness, 15' radius|darkness]]'' for {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} around them. Additionally, if they successfully attacked an opponent with their horn, they could ''[[inflict light wounds]]'' up to three times each day. Once per day, they could ''[[teleport without error|teleport]]'' themselves and their riders without risk, but could only teleport while in darkness or shadow. Their teleportation ability did not necessarily affect their rider, however, and the person would sometimes be left behind to fend for herself.\n\nBlack unicorns were highly intelligent and could learn to speak [[Common]]. Because of this, it was rumored that Thayan wizards were trying to teach them to cast spells with only verbal components.\n\nAdditionally, black unicorns could see up to {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} in complete and even magical darkness. However, they disliked light.\n\nThe horn of a black unicorn was poisonous; anyone struck by it risked being paralyzed for as long as three days before dying of heart failure. The horn could be used to make an extremely potent and fast-acting poison that could kill or paralyze the victim. It could also be ground up to make a highly potent contact poison.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Usages": "The horn of a black unicorn, when powdered, could be used to create a potent contact poison. The horn could also be affixed to the head of a [[lance]] to create a dangerous weapon."
        },
        "History": "Black unicorns were created by Thayan wizards by mixing the blood of [[tanar'ri]] with that of normal unicorns.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], black unicorns were known to be a mainstay of the Thayan military and served in it in large numbers. One prominent regiment of black unicorn riders were the [[Sisters of Cyric]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, a contingent of black unicorn cavalry accompanied Zulkir [[Nevron]]'s forces in the ill-fated [[Battle of the Gorge]] at the [[Gorge of Gauros]].",
        "Notable Black Unicorns": "*[[Omen of Despair]], a unique unicorn corrupted by the necromantic powers of [[Szass Tam]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR."
