        "Description": "A unicorn resembled a horse with a white coat, mane, and tail. However, it had a number of traits that distinguished it from a horse, including cloven hooves and a long ivory-colored horn that protruded from its forehead. Males had a white beard.",
        "Abilities": "Unicorns were not subject to [[poison]], [[death magic]], or ''[[charm]]'' spells. Unicorns were able to sense evil nearby and radiate an aura which protected them from most evil spells. A touch of the unicorn's horn could both heal wounds and cure poison. Unicorns also had the ability to [[teleport]] to nearby locations.",

            "Black unicorn": "[[Black unicorn]]s were the evil counterparts of regular unicorns. They were created through magical breeding programs by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].",

            "Dusk unicorn": "[[Dusk unicorn]]s were a rare, dark-colored variant considered auspicious by fey.",
            "Sea unicorn": "Sea unicorns were a rumored variety of aquatic unicorn found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], resembling a [[hippocampus]] with a horn.\n\nAdditionally, there were certain depraved rituals that required removing the horn of a living unicorn. Most of the time, the unicorn so violated only survived a short time, but in some cases they went mad and, under a mild demonic influence, transformed into a horror called a [[bloodlance]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/357/Defiled Monsters|46-48}}"

        "Combat": "Unicorns attacked primarily by impaling foes on their horns, although they could also use their hooves as weapons.",
        "Society": "Unicorns dwelt deep within their forests and shunned most creatures, only conferring with [[fey]] such as [[pixie]]s, [[dryad]]s, and [[sprite]]s. They usually showed themselves only in defense of their forests. They scratched glyphs into the bark of trees in the areas under their protection.\n\nUnicorns mated for life.\n\nUnicorns that rested at the [[Place of the Unicorn]], sacred to the unicorn goddess [[Lurue]], in the [[Sword Mountains]] were healed of all injury and disease.",

            "Relationships": "Unicorns were often sent as servants of [[Corellon|Corellon Larethian]], [[Eldath]], [[Isis]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Lurue]], [[Mielikki]], [[Mystra]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], [[Sheela Peryroyl]], [[Silvanus]], [[Solonor Thelandira]], and [[Tymora]] to aid their worshipers.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}",

        "History": "A cavalry of 50-100 \"unicornriders\" existed in ancient [[Cormanthyr]].\n\nDuring the [[Shoon Imperium|Shoon Dynasty]], rulers experimented on unicorns in an attempt to discover the secrets of eternal youth. A herd of unicorns used to inhabit [[Shilmista]] before they and the [[elf|elves]] that tended them were slaughtered in [[355 DR]] by Necroqysar [[Shoon  VII]] for use in the [[Tome of the Unicorn]] and the [[Staff of Shoon]].\n\nIn the [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], inhumanely shackled and clamped unicorns could be found in the Stockyards of [[Samora]], [[Azzagrat]], chained and manacled around their necks to stakes driven deep into the ground, heavy metal harnesses preventing them from teleporting away or even lifting their heads as they awaited being slaughtered and eaten by influential residents of the Abyss such as [[Graz'zt]]'s loyal servant [[Maretta]], Lady of the Counting-House.",
