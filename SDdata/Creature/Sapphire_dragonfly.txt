A '''sapphire dragonfly''' was a large, blue [[dragonfly]] that could be found in [[northwest Faerûn]], including [[Icewind Dale]], the [[Sword Coast North]], and the [[Savage Frontier]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a sapphire dragonfly found its way into the home of [[Edgin]] and [[Zia Darvis]] in [[Targos]]. While Edgin moved to kill or capture the insect, Zia opened a window to "let it go". After Zia's death at the hands of a [[Red Wizard]], a sapphire dragonfly appeared above her pyre, and henceforth the insect would remind Edgin of his lost wife.
