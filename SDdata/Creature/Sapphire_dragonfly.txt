A sapphire dragonfly was a large, blue dragonfly that could be found in northwest Faer√ªn, including Icewind Dale, the Sword Coast North, and the Savage Frontier.
In the late 15 century DR, a sapphire dragonfly found its way into the home of Edgin and Zia Darvis in Targos. While Edgin moved to kill or capture the insect, Zia opened a window to "let it go". After Zias death at the hands of a Red Wizard, a sapphire dragonfly appeared above her pyre, and henceforth the insect would remind Edgin of his lost wife.
