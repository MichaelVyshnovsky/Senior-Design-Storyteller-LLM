        "mainbody": "A dragonscale slough, also known as a dracolich slough, was a type of undead animate\nThese undead were slithering masses of dragon flesh and molted scales, infused with negative energy. They were capable of climbing up walls and ceilings.\nDragonscale sloughs were inherently hostile undead. They were unintelligent, but exhibited many of the same attitudes and instincts as the dragon they were molted from. And they were found to gravitate towards sources of heat.\nThese animates were vulnerable to fire-based spells and effects, sunlight, and the spell remove disease.\nThese undead often scaled walls to drop down onto prey, who they would then proceed to try and constrict in their scales and suck out their life energy."
