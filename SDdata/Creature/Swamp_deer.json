        "mainbody": "Swamp deer were a small species of deer that inhabitanted swampy areas.\nSwamp deer were quite small, standing  at the shoulder. They were well-camouflaged and could blend into their swampy habitats.\nWhen another creature got close to a swamp deer, it would freeze in place, allowing it to take full advantage of its camouflage and making it surprisingly hard to spot. Any sudden movement would then spook the deer, causing it to flee.\nSwamp deer made for a good meal if they could be caught.\nThey could be found in the boggy parts of Vaasa during the summer months."
