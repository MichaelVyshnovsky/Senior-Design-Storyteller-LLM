        "mainbody": "A '''giant squid''' was a rare, gargantuan, and powerful [[squid]].",
        "Description": "These squids were similar to the standard mollusks that posed no threat to society. Giant squids, however, were dangerous hunters, and would attack anything they encountered, even ships. They were absolutely huge, measuring over {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} long, and had ten powerful tentacles. Giant squids were protected by a hard shell, but were vulnerable in other areas.",
        "Behavior": "Giant squids were excellent and fast swimmers, and able to jet away at extremely quick speeds.",
        "Combat": "Such creatures mainly attacked by constricting their foes with their strong tentacles and biting them. It was possible for these squids to have their tentacles severed, and if so, they grew back within a few days. If they were losing a fight, they were able to emit huge inky clouds and swim away.\n\nMany sailors believed that many vessels had little chance of surviving a giant squid attack, with stories abounding of the mollusks snapping [[galleon]]s in half or dragging whole ships to the bottom of the ocean. However, in reality most giant squids fell short of accomplishing such impressive feats.",
        "Sub-Species": {
            "'''Giant river squid'''": "A species of giant squid that was endemic to the rivers of [[Kara-Tur]].",
            "Kraken": "Some believed that krakens were actually a species of giant squid."

        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "These squids appeared in natural waters, such as in the [[Staunt Pools]] of [[Luruar]] and [[Mlossae]],{{Cite dragon/267/The New Adventures of Volo: Onward!|82-83}} the Lower Depths ({{SIrange|1200|2400|ft}} below sea level) of the [[Inner Sea]],<ref> the deep sea trench of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], and the depths of the [[Crowded Sea]].<ref>\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material]], giant squids were known to inhabit the [[Abyssian Ocean]]<ref> and the [[Fated Depths]], a water-based [[fiendish plane]] of limitless depth.",
            "Relationships": "Though they were deadly predators in their right own, giant squids were often preyed upon by hungry toothed [[whale]]s, such as [[cachalot]]s In terms of domestication, some [[nereid]]s were known to keep giant squids as pets and the giant animals were also often kept and revered by the [[Kraken Society]].\n\nThe [[marid]] [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] had some giant squids as servants in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].",
            "Usages": "[[File:AD&D TC - giant squid.jpg|thumb|258x258px|''A giant squid attacking a ship.'']]\nOccasionally giant deepwater squids could be found for sale in the fish markets of [[Waterdeep]].<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-07-31 - Fish markets of Waterdeep}}\n\n[[Stuffed giant squid]] was a specialty dish, as big as a short [[human]], served at the [[Tulmene's Tower]] inn of [[Tethyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nGiant squid sepia was a very common [[material component]] in [[spell]]s, particularly those that involved language, detection, and reading. It was used in ''[[erase]]'', ''[[message]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', and ''[[comprehend languages]]''. The mage [[Casimur]] reported that a form of ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'' developed by [[Asmiak]] in the ''[[Book of the Silver Talon]]'' could be cast using giant squid sepia, but it had a reduced duration compared to using [[giant octopus]] ink.<ref> Giant river squid [[ink]] was used to paint the magical cards of the [[Edu'sascar]] at [[S'tung Monastery]] in [[T'u Lung]].\n\nA piece of a giant squid tentacle was one of the material components of the ''[[battle tentacles]]'' spell.{{Cite dragon/344/A Dark and Stormy Knight|60}}\n\nSuch giant squids could be summoned by the ''[[summon monster IX]]'' spell."

        "Trivia": "* The shape of [[squid ship]]s, particularly the hull of the [[Morkoth (ship)|''Morkoth'']], resembled giant squids.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, a popular rumor that floated in the taverns of [[Ten Towns]] claimed that evil [[gnome]]s of the [[Zhentarim]] turned a giant squid into an ''airship'' and were heading to [[Icewind Dale]] aboard the flying monstrosity."
