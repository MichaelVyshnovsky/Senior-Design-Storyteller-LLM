'''Goats''' were common herd animals. 

==Combat==
Goats were peaceful animals but attacked if cornered. They usually attacked by charging.

==Habitat==
In Zakhara, goats were one of the most common domesticated herd animals, with some [[human]] clans claiming herds of thousands of individual goats. Nomadic [[Janni|Jann]] tribes herded goats, and some [[ogre giant]] clans as well. Herds could be found among the many islands of Zakhara, usually tended by [[reef giant]]s.

In eastern [[Calimshan]], goats and sheep were the only herd animals hardy enough to survive in the harsh environment.  In the eastern and southeastern foothill fringes of [[Anauroch]], goats and sheep were likewise herded by the [[D'tarig]].

Eastern breed of cashmere goats produced wool, used in weaving of luxurious fabric simply called [[cashmere]].

Several settlements on Yggdrasil kept goat herds.

==Ecology==

Female goats were called does, male goats were called bucks, and juvenile goats were called kids. They lived in herds of up to two bucks and a dozen does, and twice as many kids.
==Uses==
Goats provided [[milk]], which could be turned into goat [[cheese]]. [[Vilksmaarg]] was a pungent and salty type of goat cheese made in [[Vilkstead]] and was popular in taverns along the [[Sword Coast]]. Kragh is an alcoholic beverage made by [[cyclopskin]]. It is made from fermented goat's or [[sheep]]'s milk.{{Cite dragon/254/The Ecology of the Cyclopskin|104}} The skin of a goat could be fashioned into a handy drinking vessel. Goat hair could be shorn to make wool. In Zakhara, it was common practice to blend the hair from a [[camel]] and a goat while making wool.

Goat's meat was referred to as chevon and often was simply cooked as steaks over a campfire, seasoned with roadside herbs and pepper. Single serving of chevon was valued at three [[gold]] [[coin]]s.

In [[Kara-Tur]], a goat was worth up to 5 [[tael]].

In [[Neverwinter]], goat meat was one of the many common fillings used in savory pies.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-11-25 - Neverwinter Cuisine}}
