'''Reeos''' was a species of rare [[human]]-sized [[bird]]s native to the [[Malatran Plateau]] of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Reeos were large birds, the size of a medium [[humanoid]] creature. They had white plumage and green wings as well as green tail tips. Reeos had long beaks and rakish {{SI|2'|'"|long=yes}} long legs.

==Personality==
Reeos were not easily spooked and tended to be unmovable when guarding their eggs. If a menacing creature approached a nesting reeos, it menacingly rose on its legs and screamed in a head-splitting screech. The only way to remove a reeos from its nest was hurting or killing it. The birds tended to retreat if faced with strong foes and suffering some serious bodily harm.

==Combat==
In battle, reeos relied on distraction and disorientation caused by their incessant screeching and abundant feathers and down that filled the air during a struggle. The birds used their long beaks to pierce enemy armor and wing buffets that bludgeoned foes and released feathers disorienting the enemy. Lastly, reeos did not just emit your cacophony of screams but also could produce painful piercing shrieks that physically damaged the enemy up close. The more reeos produced such screeches at the same time, the more damage was done to the attacker.

==Ecology==
Reeos could be found nesting on river shores and by cascading waterfalls in the Living Jungle. The birds nested not closer than {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} apart. Hatchling reeos were tiny wrinkled creatures, bald and blind. If the parents were forced to leave their nests, reeos abandoned any chicks and unhatched eggs. Hatchlings were helpless and quietly chirped for their parents. Knowledgeable humanoids could raise a hatchling reeos if they manage to feed it once every hour.

Their eggs were green and white colored, weighted around {{SI|1|lb|k|long=yes}} and were the size of a [[grapefruit]]. Reeos eggs were considered a valuable delicacy. Their value was great due to the delicious taste, reeos's rarity, and the fact that without a parent heating their eggs in a nest, reeos eggs rotted away within two days. It was impossible to successfully hatch a reeos egg without the parent bird's involvement. White reeos eggs possessed a magical quality to imbue the eater with intuitive knowledge of animal life.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Year of Discovery on the Malatran calendar, a group of heroes of the Living Jungles embarked on a spiritual quest to help a dying [[saru]] village build a totem appeasing an angered and fickle [[earth spirit]] [[Ligela]]. The adventurers were sent toward a nearby waterfall to find special green stones needed for construction. There, the heroes found numerous species of nesting birds, including reeos. After disposing of the flying beasts, the adventurers found several of the stones in reeos's nests amid their now abandoned green eggs.
