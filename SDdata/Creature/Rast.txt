'''Rasts''' were creatures living on several distant [[plane]]s, most notably the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Ash]].

==Description==
A rast was a creature of ash and cinder with ten to fifteen legs, a bulbous floating body, and great head filled with teeth. It was the size of a great [[dog]] and weighed around 200 pounds (90 kilograms).

==Behavior==
They roamed around in swarms of half a dozen and continuously consumed any prey they were able to catch and kill.

==Abilities==
Rasts were brutal cunning creatures able to [[paralyze]] their foes with but a glance. They would attack with four of their many claws, grapple their prey, and drain its blood, all while it was still alive.

Were they lose to their ability to float by some magical means however, they would become greatly hampered as their fighting was predicated on their flight and they could to little else than try to regain their bearings.
