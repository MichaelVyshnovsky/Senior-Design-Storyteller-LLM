A '''gorbel''' ({{Pronounce|G0R|bel|refs = {{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was an odd creature believed to be related to the [[beholder]].

==Description==
A gorbel usually appeared as a red globe of slimy and rubbery material, with six tiny red eyes on short, retractable eyestalks on top of its head.<ref group="note" name="error">In their brief mention within the book ''[[I, Tyrant]]'', gorbels are described as having claws at the end of their eyestalks. This description is not corrobated in any other source and is stated in the later ''[[Dragon magazine 270|Ecology of the Gorbel]]'' to be an erroneous description. 
 
They had a pair of stubby clawed legs. Despite the shortness of their limbs these creatures were quite agile and dexterous. Their mouths were small, yet very rubbery, and could stretch to {{SI|18|in|long=yes}} in diameter.

==Behavior==
Gorbels were known to be very curious, mischievous, and volatile. Other creatures often considered them to be irritable.

==Biology==
The bodies of these were resilient to being harmed by blunt force. However, it was vulnerable to pointed or edged weaponry, such as blades, and liable to burst from them.

==Combat==
Gorbels typically attacked by attempting to latch onto the backs of an opponent with their stubby clawed legs. Gorbels would try to maintain this hold until either they or their victim were dead.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]] and up to [[1368 DR]], gorbels could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].
