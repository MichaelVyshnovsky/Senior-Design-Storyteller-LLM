        "Description": "The most distinguishing features of this species was that they had translucent, cobweb-like wings. Some would describe them as being similar to the wings of a dragonfly.",
        "Abilities": "These creatures had a [[poison]]ous bite.",
        "Behavior": "This species exhibited a low level of intelligence. This made them capable of being trained and of recognizing people by their gestures, smell, and voice.",

        "Ecology": {
            "Relationships": "Many were known to train flying spiders to act as guardian animals, who would remain loyal so long as they were regularly fed. This practice was quite common and open in [[Skullport]]. One could find them secretly being used as such in many cities throughout [[Faer√ªn]], such as in [[Calimshan]] and [[Waterdeep]]. In the latter city they secretly served inside of the villas of [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobility]], in the strongrooms of merchants, and in the apartments of [[wizard]]s."
