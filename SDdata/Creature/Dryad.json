        "mainbody": "ryads (), also known as wood nymphs, were fey-maidens who acted as the protectors of forests and trees.\nThey appeared to be beautiful women with delicate features seemingly made of soft wood. Their hair seemed to be made of leaves and foliage that changed color with the seasons of the calendar.\nAll dryads were magically bound to a single tree. These trees served as the dryads life force and home. They fought to the death to protect their bonded tree, as should the tree be cut or destroyed, the dryad died soon afterward. A dryad could not stray too far from her bonded tree without suffering the same fate. If a dryad left the vicinity of her tree for too long, she died.\nAcorn of far travel If a dryad spellcaster cast this spell on an acorn harvested from her bonded oak tree, she was considered to be in contact with her tree at all times, regardless of the actual distance between them. Thus she became able to travel great distances without growing sick.\nDryads in service of Sharindlar were known to inhabit her divine realm of the Merciful Court.\nAlong with other fey, dryads spoke Sylvan, Elven and Common.\nDryads inhabited the plane of Arborea, and could be found in the areas around the Gilded Hall, Fermata, and Brightwater.\nSome of the dryads that inhabited Toril worshiped the goddess Mielikki. Other dryads worshiped Verenestra of the Seelie Court, including the dryads of Evermeet. \nThey were favored representatives of great number of deities, such as Baervan Wildwanderer, Corellon Larethian, Eldath, Erevan Ilesere, Hanali Celanil, Mielikki, Rillifane Rallathil, Sharess, Sharindlar, Sheela Peryroyl, Silvanus, Solonor Thelandira, Sune, and Thard Harr."
