        "mainbody": "'''Bloodfire oozes''' were an unnatural type of [[ooze]], infused with [[elemental fire]], that were created through horrid rituals.",
        "Description": "The average bloodfire ooze was roughly {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} long and weighed around {{SI|8000|lbs.|k|long=yes}}. Though larger specimens were known to exist and these oozes grew larger the more blood they consumed.\n\nThese amorphous oozes resembled a slithering mass of seething and boiling blood. Occasionally they manifested faces that were twisted in torment, which were personifications of its demonic essence and often resembled the faces of those whose blood was sacrificed to create them.\n\nBloodfire oozes radiated tremendous heat from their bodies and reeked of the smell of sulfur. Whenever they quickly absorbed any faces that manifested upon them, clouds of [[poison]]ous sulfuric gas would be disgorged.",
        "Behavior": "These oozes were virtually mindless creatures, only dimly aware of their surroundings. Though they were motivated by evil acts and the moment they came into existence a bloodfire oozed pursued nourishment.",
        "Abilities": "These creatures were impervious to harm from elemental fire and their bodies radiated a sort of demonic fire. Though they were vulnerable to cold-based attacks. \n\nDue to their affinity for fire, they increased the power of any fire-based [[spell]] or spell-like ability that was cast within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of them.",
        "Combat": "Bloodfire oozes did not employ any sophisticated tactics, Any creature that struck them or was touched by them would be inflicted with harm from elemental fire, said fire being so potent it could partially bypass fire resistance . In addition, they were known to spew flames at their enemies from distances of up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "History": "In [[1375 DR]], a [[phaerimm]] lairing within the tomb of the [[Netherese]] scholar [[Augathra the Mad]] created a blighted bloodfire ooze.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], bloodfire oozes could be found within [[Mount Hotenow]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Bloodfire oozes fed upon the blood of other creatures and were especially nourished by the blood of good-aligned creatures.",
            "Relationships": "Bloodfire oozes recognized their creators and could be harnessed as guardians so long as they were regularly fed. They were often paired alongside [[trap]]s and other monsters that had a strong resistance or immunity to fire.\n\nIn [[Faer√ªn]], these oozes were most common in the land of [[Thay]]. There they were created by [[Red Wizards]] to guard their laboratories, temples, and other important locales. Beyond them, fanatical [[priest]]s of [[Orcus]] and other [[demon prince]]s were most often associated with creating these creatures.\n\nEvil [[evoker]]s and evil [[outsider]]s that could use fire spells or abilities, as well as beings of fire, were known to create or keep these creatures nearby in order to enhance their own fiery abilities. Such \"beings of fire\" included [[efreet]] and [[salamander]]s."
