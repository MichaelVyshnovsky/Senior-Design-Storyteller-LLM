They took joy from their own existence and lived lives of celebration and art. Their wild natures left them somewhat unpredictable, yet they could always be trusted to avoid actual wickedness.\n\nEladrin were archenemies of all manner of [[fiend]]s, and would roam the multiverse looking for people to aid with acts of kindness",

        "Society": "[[File:Morwel RonSpencer.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Queen Morwel and her consort Faerinaal.'']]\nIn Arborea, an eladrin was constantly on the move, seeking beauty and adventure from place to place. A ''[[portal]]'' linked the realms of Arvandor and the Gates of the Moon, so that the eladrin could travel freely back and forth amongst their kin.\n\nThe eladrin of Arvandor and the Gates of the Moon respected and often worked with the [[Seldarine]] but were not subservient to them. Her [[Court of Stars|court]] was found in the Gates of the Moon.",
        "Ecology": "While the goddess [[Sel√ªne]] sometimes transformed favored [[petitioner]]s into eladrin as a reward for their faithful service in their mortal lives, the majority of eladrin were ''not'' the reformed spirits of [[chaotic good]] elves; rather, most were born to eladrin parents. They enjoyed very long lives, but they were not truly immortal.",
        "History": "[[File:Androlynne-3e.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''A [[foo lion]] and a group of eladrin prepare for battle on the [[Abyss]]al layer of [[Androlynne]].'']]\nThe eladrin were only distantly related to the elves. As far as they knew, they had been ruled by Queen Morwel for their entire existence.\n\nThe eladrin were responsible for driving the [[obyrith]]s from the [[Abyss]] in the ancient past. After the [[Queen of Chaos]] and her armies were defeated on the world of [[Oerth]] at the [[Field of Pesh]], her consort [[Miska the Wolf-Spider]] was trapped in an extra-dimensional prison. Queen Morwel took advantage of this weakening of the obyriths' power. An eladrin army, including legions of [[ghaele]]s, was led by Morwel, Faerinaal, and Gwynharwyf into the Abyss, and they nearly eliminated all obyriths from the multiverse, slaughtering them upon the [[Plain of Infinite Portals]]. Unfortunately, this power vacuum allowed the [[tanar'ri]] to come to power.\n\nBefore the obyriths lost the Abyss, however, [[Pale Night]], Mother of Demons, tricked [[Ascodel]], then the Royal Consort of Morwel, into a pact, the result of which condemned thousands of eladrin children to the 471{{st}} layer of the Abyss, [[Androlynne]]. Countless celestials responded and came to the eladrin children's aid&mdash;[[ki-rin]], [[foo creature]]s, [[hollyphant]]s, [[moon dog]]s, [[couatl]], and the eladrin themselves. The war to protect the bound eladrin children continued for millennia."
