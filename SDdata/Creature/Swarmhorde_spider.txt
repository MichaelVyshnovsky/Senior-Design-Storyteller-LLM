Swarmhorde spiders were a species of giant spiders that inhabited the Underdark and its entrance in the Kings Forest of Cormyr.
Swarmhorde spiders were a relatively small variety of giant spider with brown exoskeletons that resembled dead forest leaves. They were small and slow but, as the name suggests, swarmhorde spiders hunted in overwhelming swarms.
The spiders tracked their victims via tremorsense and attacked their prey by biting them and injecting them with poison.
In the late 15 century DR, a number of swarmhorde spiders were found infesting the Kings Forest during the Darkening and found hunting in the Underdark areas underneath the forest, as well as within the Haunted Halls.
