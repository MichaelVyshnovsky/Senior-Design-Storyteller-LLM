Much like other mustelids, martens were skilled swimmers.\nThese creatures were a carnivorous species.\nLike other mustelids, martens could be found in a wide variety of climates, though they more commonly inhabited cooler ones. They generally preferred to avoid dense settlements.\nIn north Faerûn, they could be found in parts of the Dalelands, particularly Daggerdale\nBeyond Faerûn, martens could be found across much of the continent of Kara-Tur, living in temperate forests and plains as well as tropical and sub-tropical forests.\nSome wizards were known to have martens as familiars.\nThe hides of these creatures were quite valued, ranking among the most prized pelts of the Silver Marches. They were valued more than the hides of ferrets, stoats, and weasels, while they were typically valued less than those of ermines, minks, and sables, though they could fetch comparable prices.\nThe marten pelts of the Silver Marches were carried and traded all across the Sword Coast,\nIn the church of Baervan Wildwanderer, \"Marten\" was one of the titles for confirmed priests, ranking directly above \"Hedgehog\" and below \"Red Fox\"."
