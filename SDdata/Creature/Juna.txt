}}{{Quote|Who were the elder ones? I do not know&mdash;no spacefarer alive today does. Deep space is littered with their artifacts: monstrous artificial asteroids, with nothing left but their three-armed symbol graven in the stone.|[[Gamalon Idogyr]] of [[Tethyr]], from a lecture before the [[Seekers]] at the [[Library of the Spheres]] on the [[Rock of Bral]].}}
The '''Juna''' were an ancient, lost race of [[wildspace]]. they were thought by some to be responsible for the seeding of many of the sentient races across the [[crystal sphere]]s of the multiverse.The name "Juna" is only used in the [[Cloakmaster Cycle]] of [[Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space|Spelljammer]] novels, but the descriptions in those books match extremely closely with the "Keepers" mentioned in other Spelljammer sources.

It was postulated that the Juna were also the creators of [[Spelljammer (spelljammer)|''The Spelljammer'']] itself and the terraformers of the planet [[Radole]].

==Description==
The Juna had bodies with trigonal symmetry, similar to [[tirapheg]]s or [[xorn]]s, bearing three arms and three legs. They stood about as tall as a [[halfling]] and had barrel-shaped bodies. Their eyes were large and milky-white in color.

==Combat==
It is not known how the Juna fought, but they left behind a few examples of weapons, long, curved daggers grown from a strange crystalline material and enchanted with magic. 

==Society==
So powerful a race were the Juna that they were worshiped as gods by hundreds of lesser races during their height. They traveled the many crystal spheres in disc-shaped [[spelljammer]]s, collecting the native life of various worlds and taking specimens elsewhere. Some postulated that this was why so many of the same kinds of creatures were found in so many different crystal spheres. They were also responsible for the artificial creation of asteroids, which were later abandoned.

==History==
Little is known about the true history of the Juna, but the most eminent scholar studying their existence, the [[illithid]] historian [[Estriss]], first found their name mentioned in the ancient myths and poetry of the [[thri-kreen]] from the era when that insectoid race were primarily spacefarers. References were later found in other ancient sources, but it should be noted that many scholars rejected Estriss' work.

Nevertheless, evidence of their existence was found in carvings among ruins and in cave paintings all across the many spheres. One major example of this was in the depths of the Shieldwall Mountains that protected the Ribbon of Radole, turning it into a hospitable paradise in the midst of an otherwise harsh and extreme planet. Massive murals left by the Juna were discovered in huge chambers deep in these mountains.

The Juna were theorized to have existed millions of years before the recorded history of [[Realmspace]], and it was thought that they began to die out or vanished at about the same time that both [[human]]s and mind flayers first appeared.

In modern times, several religions arose among lesser races of some worlds, who considered the Juna to have been lost gods.

In [[1361 DR]], a collector of antiquities living in the city of [[Rauthaven]] on the island nation of [[Nimbral]] on [[Toril]] died, and his collection was sold at auction. This collection contained several artifacts from the Juna. One of the items was a long, curved knife, which was sold to the Arcane [[T'k'Pek]] for 10,000 [[gold piece]]s.

At about the same time period, a young farmer from the planet [[Krynn]], named [[Teldin Moore]], happened upon a [[Cloak of the First Pilot|magic cloak]] said to belong to "the creators". This cloak had a multitude of magical powers and was covered in an intricate geometrical pattern of three-petaled flowers, indicative of the Juna.
