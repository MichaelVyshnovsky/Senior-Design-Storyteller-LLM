==Ecology==
===Habitats===
[[File:Cormyr Heartlands.png|thumb|right|200px|''A group of deer in the [[Heartlands]] of Cormyr.'']]
Deer were commonly found in the [[Pellamcopse Woods]], north of [[Waterdeep]]. 

In [[north Faer√ªn]], deer could be found in the [[Tangled Vale]] and throughout the forests of [[the Vast]].

In the [[Unapproachable East]], deer could be found in the [[Tannath Gap]], [[Rashemen]], and [[Immil Vale]].

Beyond [[Toril]], deer inhabited the planet known as [[Radole]]. Giant black stags with red eyes that could gore an [[elephant]] with ease served the goddess [[Beshaba]] and inhabited her [[Abyss]]al realm of the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 13: Blood Tor|Blood Tor]].

===Relationships===
[[Hybsil]]s were often on good terms with deers.{{Cite_book/Monster_Manual_II_(1983)|77}}

Deer were the preferred animal manifestations of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]], [[Shiallia]], and [[Silvanus]]. Stags in particular were favored by the gods [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], [[Eldath]], and [[Rillifane Rallathil]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}} A white hart in the [[High Forest]] was considered sacred to [[Mielikki]].<ref>

==Usage==
Deer meet was eaten under the name '''venison'''. In the [[Silverymoon/Hollowhar|Hollowhar]] area of [[Silverymoon]], peppered venison stew was popular and venison-and-[[mushroom]] broth was a specialty of [[Swordsfall House]].{{Cite web/My Slice of Silverymoon/Part 2}}

[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold deer hides for 4 [[gold piece]]s a piece.

The antlers of deer could be boiled down to create a sort of glue.

==Cultural Significance==
* Throughout the Realms, the words "doe" and "stag" were used as polite and rather [[bard]]ic terms for one's female or male lover respectively.

==Notable Deer==
* [[White Stag of Labelas]], a unique servant of [[Labelas Enoreth]] on the island of [[Evermeet]].
* [[White Stag of Dargendale]]: the elusive white deer from the forests of [[Dargendale]] who was killed and stuffed by a poacher but later was animated by a [[druid]] to exact revenge on his killer.
