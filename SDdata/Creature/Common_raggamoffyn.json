        "Combat": "All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creature's control.\n\nCommon raggamoffyns usually attempted to control [[human]]-sized targets. Targets who temporatily escaped their control risked being asphyxiated.",
        "Society": "These creatures were usually encountered in alleys, rubbish heaps, and the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]]. They often gathered in packs of controlled [[thieves]], watchmen, and others who were active at night."
