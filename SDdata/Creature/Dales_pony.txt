The '''Dales pony''' was a breed of working [[pony|equine]] that was commonly found throughout the ranches and farms of the [[Dalelands]]. They were also popular throughout [[northeast Faerûn]], as a training pony kept by the wealthy upper class.

==Description==
These ponies were exceptionally varied in appearance, due to the fact they had been bred with just about every stock of pony or horse from throughout the Realms.

Despite their diverse stock, the ponies of the Dales maintained a few key characteristics: a sure-footed stance, a powerful jump, and a strong sense of self-preservation.
