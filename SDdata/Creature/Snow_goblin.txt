'''Snow goblins''', also known as '''frost goblins''', were a type of [[goblinoid]] found in arctic regions.

==Description==
Snow goblins stood about {{SIrange|3|4|ft|long=yes}} tall, with the females being larger than the males. They had long arms and short legs, and a distinct sac on their throat that was said to give them a frog-like appearance. Their fur changed color depending on the season: it was black or brown in the summer and white in the winter. It was also typically encrusted with ice and snow.

==Abilities==
Snow goblins were not particularly intelligent creatures. Like most goblinoids, they possessed [[darkvision]]. They were capable at climbing.

The sac on a snow goblin's throat allowed it to make loud sounds that carried a considerable distance. These noises were used both to signal between hunting and war parties, as well as to intimidate opponents.

==Personality==
Snow goblins were aggressive creatures known to attack other people. The females were noted as being more aggressive than the males, as well as crueler and more inventive when it came to torturing captives. Snow goblins were most commonly [[neutral evil]].

==Combat==
Snow goblins had only a weak grasp of tactics but were capable of simple ambushes and the like, sometimes preceded by deliberately causing avalanches. While in their native hills, they were fearless. Snow goblins preferred to fight in groups, and individually fought bravely but were uncoordinated.

==Society==
Snow goblins lived in cold, hilly regions. They typically served a more powerful creature such as a [[frost giant]], [[ogre]], or a priest of a winter deity.

Snow goblins enjoyed the taste of horseflesh and would raid settlements to acquire it.

Snow goblins were known to revere [[megaloceros]] as "Great Snow Elk".> They were superstitiously afraid of the [[frost folk]] because of their ice blast ability.

==Notable Frost Goblin Tribes==
* [[Winterkill]], the frost goblin tribe of [[Icespire Peak]].
