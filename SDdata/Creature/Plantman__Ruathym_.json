        "mainbody": "lantmen were four-armed monsters with a large, vertical maw. They emerged on the island of Ruathym during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR.\nPlantmen had a muscular, roughly humanoid shape, with four tentacle-like arms, three-taloned feet, and a vertical yellow-rimmed maw that resembled that of a venus flytrap instead of a head. Situated beneath their jaws were a pair of glowing yellow eyes. Plantmen were green-skinned.\nPlantmen were aggressive, seemingly attacking non-plantmen on sight.\nPlantmen attacked primarily by striking and constricting opponents with their tentacles, as well as by biting down on their restrained preys head.\nSome time after Labelas Enoreth and Clangeddin Silverbeard fought on Ruathym, plantmen started appearing on the island, attacking inhabitants and the crew of the Realms Master. Although the crew managed to escape thanks to the intervention of Labelas, many of the islands inhabitants died to the creatures onslaught."
