        "mainbody": "'''Landwyrms''' were a type of lesser, wingless dragon, each species of which was near-perfectly adapted to its environment.",
        "Description": "Landwyrms were large, wingless dragons. Their appearance varied greatly between species.",
        "Personality": "Landwyrms were strong-willed and had independent natures.",
        "Abilities": "Like other dragons, landwyrms emanated a fear-inducing aura.",
        "Combat": "Although all landwyrm species had different ways of fighting, they all tended to favor stealth and surprise. Additionally, they saw nothing wrong with fleeing a battle only to return later. They were skilled trackers.",
        "Ecology": "All landwyrms were specific to different environments, to which they were extremely well-adapted. They possessed great knowledge about their environments and were known to share this knowledge if approached peacefully.\n\nLandwyrms were among the creatures effected by the [[Dracorage]], and would form flights along with [[wyvern]]s, [[chromatic dragon]]s, and [[elemental drake]]s, that destroyed everything they came across.<ref>\n\nThere were at least nine species of landwyrms, each of them not-so-creatively named after the environment which they inhabited. Known species of landwyrms included the [[desert landwyrm]], [[forest landwyrm]], [[hill landwyrm]], [[jungle landwyrm]], [[mountain landwyrm]], [[plains landwyrm]], [[swamp landwyrm]], [[tundra landwyrm]], and [[Underdark landwyrm]]."
