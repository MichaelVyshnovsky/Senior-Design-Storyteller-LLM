        "mainbody": "Landwyrms were a type of lesser, wingless dragon, each species of which was near-perfectly adapted to its environment.\nLandwyrms were large, wingless dragons. Their appearance varied greatly between species.\nLandwyrms were strong-willed and had independent natures.\nLike other dragons, landwyrms emanated a fear-inducing aura.\nAlthough all landwyrm species had different ways of fighting, they all tended to favor stealth and surprise. Additionally, they saw nothing wrong with fleeing a battle only to return later. They were skilled trackers.\nAll landwyrms were specific to different environments, to which they were extremely well-adapted. They possessed great knowledge about their environments and were known to share this knowledge if approached peacefully.\nLandwyrms were among the creatures effected by the Dracorage, and would form flights along with wyverns, chromatic dragons, and elemental drakes, that destroyed everything they came across.\nThere were at least nine species of landwyrms, each of them not-so-creatively named after the environment which they inhabited. Known species of landwyrms included the desert landwyrm, forest landwyrm, hill landwyrm, jungle landwyrm, mountain landwyrm, plains landwyrm, swamp landwyrm, tundra landwyrm, and Underdark landwyrm."
