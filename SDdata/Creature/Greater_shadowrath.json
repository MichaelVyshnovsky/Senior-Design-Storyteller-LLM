        "mainbody": "'''Greater shadowraths''', which were also called '''abysskin''', were a powerful form of [[undead]] that had a connection with the dangerous [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Crown of Horns]]''.",
        "Description": "A greater shadowrath appeared as they did when they were alive with the exception of their lack of eyes, skeleton, and internal organs. These missing parts were replaced with pure [[negative energy]] that was somewhat concealed by the clothing or [[armor]] worn at the time of their death. The crackling black negative energy was visible through the creature's eyes, open mouth, and any wounds.",
        "Personality": "These creatures retained the intelligence they possessed in life.",
        "Combat": "Any magical or [[psionic]] abilities acquired by a lesser shadowrath during their life were lost upon their transformation. The touch of a greater shadowrath caused intense pain in the target as well as draining a portion of their lifeforce. Any victim drained of their entire lifeforce suffered an irreversible death.",
        "Society": "These creatures often acted as bodyguards for whoever wore the ''Crown of Horns''. They followed any commands given by the ''Crown'' bearer, and often led groups of [[lesser shadowrath]]s. If left uncontrolled for some reason, a greater shadowrath sought to destroy spellcasters or followers of [[Mystra]].",
        "History": "Greater shadowraths were created by the \"Myrkul's Hand\" power of the ''Crown of Horns''."
