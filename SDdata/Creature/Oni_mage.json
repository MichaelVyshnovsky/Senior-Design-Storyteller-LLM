        "mainbody": "Oni mages, often called ogre mages or simply oni,\nSuch creatures stood at around  tall and weighed .\nOni mages were versatile giants that combined physical and magical prowess in combat, using their natural strength to deal out significant amounts of damage while relying on their regeneration ability to shrug off wounds. When they found themselves in real danger, they ducked out of combat quickly using darkness, invisibility, gaseous form, or even used their ability of flight.\nSince they generally coveted magic, oni were often known to work for evil wizards and hags in exchange for useful magical items.\nSome potion-brewers were known to use parts of oni mages for a wide variety of potions. Their teeth could be used as an ingredient in brewing potions of gaseous form, their blood could be used to brew potions of healing, and a special gland could be used in brewing potions of growth.\n* A mated pair of ogre mages, Sythillis and Cyrvisnea, ruled the Sythillisian Empire from the Small Teeth mountain range.\n* Gornak, the owner of the Hand of Vaprak, who impersonated the sage Gondal in Baldurs Gate in the midâ€“14 century DR."
