A '''chimera''' ({{Pronounce|ky|MAIR|ruh|refs={{Cite web/Dungeons & Dragons FAQ}}}} {{Pronounce|KIM|u|ru|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}|alt=yes|audio=Chimera1.ogg}} {{Pronounce|kim|AYR|u|refs=|alt=yes|audio=Chimera2.ogg}} {{Pronounce|chim|AYR|u|refs=|alt=yes|audio=Chimera3.ogg}} {{Pronounce|CHIM|u|ru|refs=|alt=yes|audio=Chimera4.ogg}}; {{Plural|chimerae|refs=}} {{Plural|chimeras|alt=yes|refs=}}) was a large [[magical beast]] that was a combination of several different creatures, namely a [[dragon]], a [[goat]], and a [[lion]]. Although typically unintelligent, chimeras were self-aware creatures, with a limited capacity for language, often [[Draconic language|Draconic]].

==Description==
A chimera had the hindquarters of a goat, the forequarters of a lion, and a set of [[dragon]] wings. Additionally, a chimera had three heads, that of a horned goat, a lion, and a dragon. This head typically resembled a [[red dragon]], though it was not unlikely to find ones with heads resembling other species of [[chromatic dragon]].

==Abilities==
All chimeras had access to an array of various abilities. Each of the heads was capable of a unique attack, but the most dangerous by far was the [[dragon breath]] of the chimera's draconic head. The exact attack varied from one individual to another, as in dragons, with the type varying based on color. For instance, a chimera with a [[white dragon]] head would cast a breath of cold air, while one with a red dragon head would bellow forth scorching flames.

==Behavior==
[[File:Chimerabattle.png|thumb|220x220px|A group of adventurers battling a chimera.]]
Chimeras were not very intelligent creatures. Their dragon-like natures often led them to attack intelligent beings for their treasure and to live solitary existences in caves, though some took after the lion and lived in prides.

A chimera did not usually perceive [[human]]s as a threat, but would normally attack the easiest source of food, and would leave humans alone if an easier source was available. They would not hesitate to withdraw from combat if they became injured, and would not seek vengeance later. A chimera preferred to attack by swooping from the sky, attacking with its claws and its jaws, but they would also charge along the ground, leading with their lion head. Once entered into combat, they would use their dragon head to defend against attackers while their lion head will attempt to grasp its victim's neck in their jaws and snap it. It was not wholly uncommon for the goat head to sleep throughout the entire battle.

==Species==
Other than variants based around which type of dragon a chimera imitated, there were other species of chimera to consider:
;'''Cormanthor chimerae''': The chimerae in [[Cormanthor]] were nomadic rather than territorial, and as a result, had a beneficial impact upon the ecology, choosing to prey on weakened or sick animals all over the forest. However, some of them were born with lips that were sensitive to sunlight, and as a result became extremely aggressive due to regular sunburns.
;[[Chimera-spawn]]: bizarre mutants known only in the [[Stonelands]]. They had a central lion's head, and two dragon heads flanking it, one breathing fire and one breathing lightning. The whole body of the chimera-spawn was covered in serpentine scales.

In addition to those species, chimerae were known to crossbreed, generating bizarre hybrids:
;[[Dracimera]]: A Hybrid of a chromatic [[dragon]] and a chimera. While there were wild dracimeras, some had been purposefully breed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]].<ref>
;[[Mantimera]]: A cross between a [[manticore]] and a [[chimera]], whose lion's head was replaced by a manticore's.{{cite book/Shining South|68-69}}
;[[Gorgimera]]: The gorgimera was a variant of the chimera, with the hindquarters and third head, of a [[gorgon]] instead of a goat. A gorgimera's gorgon head likewise had their respective breath weapon.
;[[Thessalmera]]: A hybrid of the chimera with an unknown monster.{{Cite dragon/94/Ecology of the Chimera}}

Other hybrids may have been possible, such as with [[ankheg]]s, though none had been reported as of the {{yearlinkName|1372}}.{{cite book/Monster Manual II 3rd edition|206}}

==Ecology==
Chimeras were typically seen in groups of two or three.

Mating usually occurred annually in late spring, with the females being extremely reluctant to perform the act, and even attempting to hide. They typically struggled against the more powerful males, breathing fire from the dragon head. The pregnancy would last around a year, with the average birth consisting of six offspring, which she would abandon after only a few days. The excess [[milk]] produced by the female chimera after abandoning its offspring would be released while she slept. It was a thick, black liquid, which acted as an intoxicant for [[orcs]] and could be highly prized.
===Diet===
Chimeras were an omnivorous species. They primarily ate meat and would resort to a herbivorous diet whenever prey became scarce or non-existent.
===Lairs===
Due to the draconish part of their nature, chimeras often made their lairs within caves. They often decorated these with the bones and belongings of their prey. Their hoards tended to consist primarily of [[copper]] and [[silver]] coins, with the occasional bits of jewelry and [[magical item]]s.
===Habitats===
Chimeras were very adaptable creatures, able to thrive in most climates.
===Languages===
Chimeras were capable of understanding both [[Common]] and [[Draconic language|Draconic]] though they could not speak them.
===Relationships===
Some intelligent creatures were known to train chimeras, using them as pets, guardians, or even [[mount]]s. They were sometimes found to be in the company of [[azer]]s and [[hill giant]]s.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some misguided sages claimed that chimeras were created by [[Demogorgon]], the two-headed demon lord.
