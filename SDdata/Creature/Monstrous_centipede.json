        "mainbody": "Monstrous centipedes were venomous, subterranean arthropods of giant size.\nMonstrous centipedes ranged from halfling-size to as big as the largest dragons. Their bodies ranged in color from pale grey, black, red, and brown.\nMonstrous centipedes were adept at climbing nearly any surface with their many legs.\nThese creatures were very aggressive and liable to attack anything that could be food.\nWhen attacking, a monstrous centipede would rush towards its prey and use its jaws. When it bit, it injected a sort of poison that reduced a preys mobility. This poison was weak though and not liable to be fatal.\nIn the late 14 century DR, giant centipedes were sold as fish bait at Skullys Bar and Bait in the city of Ravens Bluff.\nMonstrous centipedes could be found almost anywhere, but typically they were encountered deep underground. \nOn the surface they were known to infest the fens, moors, and deciduous forests of the Moonshae Isles. They were also known to infest the Vast Swamp between Cormyr and Sembia, the forests of Cormanthor, and the sewers of Waterdeep.\nThey were known to frequently be found in the steppes of the Hordelands, as well as its forests Ama Basin, Hagga Shan, and Shalhoond. They were also a common occurrence in its deserts, the Raurin and Quoya.\nEvil spellcasters often summoned fiendish monstrous centipedes from the Lower Planes to fight for them.\ngiantcentipede.png|A giant centipede from 2nd edition."
