in humanoid form
Boggarts, sometimes called "boggies", were the immature forms of will-o-wisps who often took the form of a small humanoid via their shapeshifting abilities.
Boggarts shapechanging ability allowed them to take on a small humanoids appearance and that of a will-o-wisp, but smaller and brighter than the regular wisps. The humanoid shape could be a perfect imitation of an individual they had witnessed or studied in the past.
Even though talented shape-changers, most boggarts could not stay in a halfling or other small humanoid form. They transformed back into their original form after 10-12 minutes.
In any of their forms, boggarts possessed the ability to become invisible for up to twelve minutes at a time, ofter utilizing it along with their terrible ability to cause confusion via unbearable noise.
Most spells were useless against boggarts, leaving them only vulnerable to magic missile, maze, and protection from evil.
When boggarts took on the will-o-wisp shape, they could move through solid objects up to  thick. This ability was limited by metal and living creatures.
