        "mainbody": "Minogons were a type of golem that resembled muscular minotaurs forged out of wizards steel.\nMinogons were as large as regular golems but unlike them, these horned constructs were not maladroit and very fast, although not smarter than an iron golem, nor their clay kin. Adventurers who were unlucky enough to encounter minogons always noted that these creatures fought with passion and anger, a trait unseen among regular constructs.\nTheir flaming clockwork engines were filled with elemental fire and rage. Their eyes glowed like coals. The smoke could be seen pouring out of their nostrils and their mouth roared with heavy mechanical screech.\nLike many other constructs, minogons were immune to critical strikes, mind-affecting magic and abilities, abilities that drained life-force and experience, death magic, diseases, paralysis, poison, critical hits, and were impossible to sneak up on.\nMinogons were also immune to most types of magic, except for spells that dealt cold damage, and fire spells. Cold-based magical effects successfully negated their rage and prevented them from raging from 6 to 60 seconds. Fire magic was beneficial to them, healing minogons on a 1-to-3 ratio, and hasting the construct for 6 to 36 seconds.\nIn combat, minogons could produce savage cries that could leave their opponents stunned three times a day.\nThey always blindly charged into combat relentlessly cleaving away with their heavy oversized two-handed swords or axes. These constructs could, and in fact always did, use their barbarian-like ability to rage, using their stalling roars in between.\nA minogons initial charge was similar to that of a bull, as the clockwork creature lowered its head and aimed to gore its opponent with its vicious sharp horns. Upon a successful hit, minogon would rend an opponent who ended up stabbed by the horns.\nthumb|A fierce minogon brandishing a sword.\nMinogons, like many similar constructs, were created via binding a spirit to a crafted body. In the case of these minotaur-like creations, spirits used for minogons needed to be agitated and raging. The two spirits used were a fire elemental and the soul of a dead minotaur warrior. These spirits were summoned and bound to the minogons flaming clockwork heart.\nThe bodies were created out of  of iron or more expensive wizards steel. The typical price for one minogons creation was 62,000 gp, 1,200 gp pf which was the materials for the body. The creatures heart furnace needed five minotaur hearts enclosed inside. The final part of creation involved the following arcane spells geas, limited wish, polymorph any object, and summon monster IV."
