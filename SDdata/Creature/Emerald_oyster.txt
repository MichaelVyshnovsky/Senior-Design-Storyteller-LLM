The emerald oyster was a type of mollusk found in the Shining Sea near the Dolphingulf of Lapaliiya in southwest Faer√ªn.
They were unique in producing brilliant green pearls, which were valued at 500 gold pieces and above. These were collected by pearl hunters of the city of Sammaresh around 1373 DR, and were key to its economy.
