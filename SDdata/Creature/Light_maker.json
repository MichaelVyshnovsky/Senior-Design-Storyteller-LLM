        "Description": "These tiny [[fey]] creatures had slender bodies that resemble those of [[elves]]. Their movements were graceful, and they did not have faces or any other features that allowed others to distinguish individual light makers apart.",
        "Abilities": "The light makers appeared seemingly out of nowhere when a new magical globe device was crafted in Mezro. They showed up ready to work at all times.",
        "Behavior": "Light makers lived in and operated Mezro's magic clockwork spheres that provided the city with light. When a light maker was inside such a globe, its intricate mechanism silently worked, rotating and pushing numerous gears and levers inside. Once tiny creatures left a globe, its light dimmed, and the gears slowed to a halt. To deactivate such a light sphere, it was enough to say \"thank you\" in the [[Tabaxi language]] into the ball. Four light makers could work one globe at a time.",
        "Ecology": "Light makers powered all the light spheres in the [[Library of Mezro]], found in the [[Scholars' Quarter]].\n\nThe number of these orbs and individual light makers was unknown. They did not need to eat nor sleep and existed simply to work Mezro's many spheres. [[Dhalmass Rayburton]] theorized that light makers could be some sort of quasi-elemental beings that were whether summoned or compelled by the orbs' mechanisms.",
        "History": "Light makers have been working on lighting up the city of [[Mezro]] long before Dhalmass Rayburton's arrival to the Chult ''circa'' [[172 DR]], and remained active in [[1362 DR]], when [[Artus Cimber]] became one of the city's [[bara]]e guardians."
