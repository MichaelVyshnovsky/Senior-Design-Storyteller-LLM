They grew to be about . \nThese creatures had luminous glands, situated above each eye and near the abdomen, that glowed a red color. If removed, these glands would continue glowing for several days. The luminosity of these glands extended outward in a radius of .\nDespite being small for giant beetles, these creatures had very powerful mandibles that could cause great injury to any human.\nIn 1492 DR, a group of troglodytes within the level of Undermountain known as the Troglodyte Warrens had domesticated giant fire beetles and were raising them for food. That same year the Harper agent Ulvira Snowveins was running a pet store in Skullport that offered, among other creatures, giant fire beetles for sale.\n* An intelligent variation of giant fire beetles were known to inhabit the celestial planes. These were often sent in answer to a good clerics summoning spells.\nGiant fire beetles were an omnivorous species of insect and could survive feeding on carrion.\nthumb|300px|In the Undermountain level of Arcturiadoom, the fire giant Hrossk lights his way with a lantern of fire beetles.\nGiant fire beetles could be found in clusters or colonies in warmer flatlands.\nIn the land of Faer√ªn they could be found in the Kings Forest of Cormyr, within Mount Hotenow, and down in the Underdark.\nIn the East they could be found in the Hordelands and Semphar. In east Zakhara, they could be found in the Grey Jungle. And in the Crowded Sea south of Zakhara, they could be found on the island chain of Nada al-Hazan.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, some were known to inhabit the Elemental Plane of Fire.\nFire beetles were a favored animal of the deity Moradin and thus would serve him, sometime acting as messengers to his followers.\nThe luminous glands of the giant fire beetle were prized by adventurers and miners alike.\nSome were known to use their glands as an alternative material component to the spell dancing lights. Their blood was also a material component for the spell infra-invisible.\nThe inhabitants of Skullport sometimes sought out the larvae of fire beetles to use as a source of illumination.\n* Phredd, a fire beetle that lived within Marigolds Menagerie."
