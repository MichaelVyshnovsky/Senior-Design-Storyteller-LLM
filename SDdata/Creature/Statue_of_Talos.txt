The Statue of Talos was an animated statue depicting the Storm Lord Talos, located in the Wayside Inn in the late 15 century DR.
The big statue of Talos was made of copper. It was shaped like a four-armed storm deity with lightning bolts in each hand.
The statue was able to fly and perceive its surroundings in the dark.
The statue attacked with each of its lightning bolt blades and headbutted its opponent.
Circa 1491 DR, the Wayside Inn was taken over by the Cult of Talos. One of the cultists, the blacksmith Teega, animated the statue of Talos in the cellar, as part of a ritual to turn the inn into a temple of Talos and gain control over the weather in the region. The statue was magically connected to Teegas life force via her bracers. A group of adventurers was able to stop the ritual in time, destroying the statue of Talos and defeating Teega and her allies.
