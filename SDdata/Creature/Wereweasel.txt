A wereweasel, or dire wereweasel,
Wereweasels had three forms humanoid, dire / giant weasel, and hybrid.
Not only humans were known to become wereweasels, but dwarves were noted to as well. All known wereweasels were chaotic and evil.
Such lycanthropes were able to hunt quickly, and matched the high speed of werejaguars. They were very stealthy and alert, could endure several attacks.
Wereweasels were known to attack with a deadly bite that could cause lycanthropy. If they were able to latch on to their enemies, they could drain them of blood. In hybrid form, wereweasels were generally well-armored, and favored attacking with their claws and bite.
These weasel-like shapechangers usually spent time around giant weasels, and were often found in groups of two to eight.
In the 14 century DR, several wereweasels were known to work for the Chosen of Malar, anth-Malar.
