A '''wereweasel''', or '''dire wereweasel''',{{Cite dungeon/129/The Twisted Run}}{{Cite dragon/40/The Other Were? Right here!|32-33}}

==Description==
Wereweasels had three forms: humanoid, dire / giant weasel, and hybrid.

Not only [[human]]s were known to become wereweasels, but [[dwarves]] were noted to as well. All known wereweasels were [[chaotic]] and [[evil]].

==Behavior==
Such lycanthropes were able to hunt quickly, and matched the high speed of [[werejaguar]]s. They were very stealthy and alert, could endure several attacks.

==Combat==
Wereweasels were known to attack with a deadly bite that could cause lycanthropy. If they were able to latch on to their enemies, they could drain them of blood. In hybrid form, wereweasels were generally well-armored, and favored attacking with their claws and bite.

==Ecology==
These weasel-like shapechangers usually spent time around giant weasels, and were often found in groups of two to eight.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several wereweasels were known to work for the [[Chosen]] of [[Malar]], [[anth-Malar]].
