        "Description": "While they appeared as [[humanoid]]s with green skin, magen were not living beings but [[magic]]al constructs. All of them had green skin and blood that appeared similar to liquid [[mercury]].",
        "Abilities": "While they all shared similar characteristics, the powers of each magen varied depending on their type. All magen had inherent protection against magical [[spell]]s and similar effects, and their bodies combusted into innocuous flames upon their death.\n\nWhile all magen were able to understand the language(s) spoken by their creator, they were not granted the ability of speech.",
        "Personality": "Magen were formed with a sense of perfect obedience. They protected their creators and catered to their needs without question or delay.",
        "Varieties": {
            "Demos magen": "These magen were often outfitted with armor and weaponry, and relegated to the duties of guards and protectors.",
            "Galven magen": "Imbued with electric energy, galven magen could ''[[shocking grasp|shock]]'' others with their touch and ''[[Lightning bolt|discharge bolts of lightning]]'' seemingly at will.",
            "Hypnos magen": "Perhaps the most powerful of their kind, hypnos magen were granted ''[[telepathy|telepathic]]'' and ''psychic'' powers, giving them the power to ''[[psychic lash|strike at the minds of others]]'' or ''[[suggestion|command others]]'' with their thoughts."
        },
        "History": "The [[arcanist]]s of ancient [[Netheril]] used magen as servants in a variety of different roles, including laborers, bodyguards, and personal attendants.\n\nA number of magen lived in the ruined [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Ythryn]] for over a millennium after the [[fall of Netheril]], well into the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
