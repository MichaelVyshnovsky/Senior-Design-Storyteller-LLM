'''Leomarhs''' were a species of [[cat|big cats]] that could be found across many [[plane]]s and whose origins were vague.

==Description==
These creatures largely resembled [[lion]]s with a golden-brown mane, except their forequarters were larger than their hindquarters, resulting in a slight slope to their back. Rather than fur, much of their body was covered by fine scales, though they had small beards. And their tails were long, similar to that of a [[snake]], that ended in a bladed spade.

On average these creatures grew to be a length of {{SIrange|6|7|ft|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
These creatures had an unusually high level of intelligence, above that of any lion or big cat, though they showed no signs of true sentience. They were extremely defensive of their cubs and were liable to attack anything that approached their lairs.

==Abilities==
Much like a [[chameleon]], leomarhs had a natural ability to change the colors of their bodies to match their surroundings. This allowed them to reach a state of near [[invisibility]] while holding still.

Leomarhs were unusually impervious to harm from the [[spell]] ''[[magic missile]]s''.

==Combat==
Prides of these creatures were known to use hit-and-runs. They would also set up expert ambushes by dividing their prides, then having several obvious attackers draw prey towards camouflaged members. They tried to drag foes down to the ground with their large, powerful foreclaws.

Leomarhs typically avoided fighting bigger foes, such as those that could call on [[magic]]al energy or were heavily armed.

==Ecology==
Much like lions, the leomarh lived and hunted in prides.

===Diet===
Like most big cats, leomarhs were a carnivorous species. They were willing to attack almost anything smaller than an [[elephant]], but their preferred prey was typically [[deer]], [[goat]]s, and [[bison]] or wild cattle. Though in some areas they would attack local peasants or lesser [[fiend]]s if they were the most plentiful supply of food.

===Habitats===
Leomarhs were native to and most common on the plains of the [[Outlands]]. However, being planar creatures, they were capable of seeing portals and thus were sometime encountered on plains in many other planes, such as [[Avernus]], [[Amoria]], [[Arcadia]], the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], [[Bytopia]], the [[Gray Waste]], [[Limbo]], [[Mechanus]], and [[Ysgard]].<ref>

===Relationships===
Leomarhs were not known to interact with intelligent races or monsters and they were incapable of being tamed. Though on rare ocassions they could be found as [[animal companion]]s of [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, or other individuals possessing an affinity with their local wildlife. On the plane of Outlands they were frequently hunted down, for they were perceived to pose a threat to travelers and other wildlife.

Leomarhs acted as [[favored animal|servants]] of the [[dwarven pantheon|dwarven deities]] [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] and [[Thard Harr]],<ref> as well as the [[demipower]] known as [[Nobanion]].<ref>

==Rumors==
Some people thought that leomarhs were [[planetouched]], and that they had strange powers and abilities in their bloodlines.
