        "Combat": "Similar to [[brass dragon]]s, most steel dragons would rather talk than fight, yet like all dragons, they could be formidable opponents. In combat, they avoided melee and instead relied on their magic. A steel dragon could cast the spells of [[cleric]]s as [[arcane magic]] and also could use the spells usually considered a part of the [[Knowledge domain|knowledge]] and [[trickery domain]]s. If truly losing a battle, a steel dragon was likely to [[teleport]] away.\n\nA steel dragon could breathe both a line of acid and a cloud of poisonous gas.",

        "Notable Steel Dragons": "The city of [[Waterdeep]] was known to be home to at least three steel dragons:\n* [[Auntyrlothtor]]\n* [[Jalanvaloss]]\n* [[Quituryte]]\nOther known steel dragons were\n* [[Stalagma]]\n* [[Steelheart]]{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|54-71}}\n* [[Velsaert|Velsaertirden]]\nIn addition, a female steel dragon named [[Razylymingeir]] lived in [[Darmshall]], and one named [[Zundaerazylym]] dwelt in [[Neverwinter]].\n\nA consortium of [[Half-dragon|half-]]steel dragons called the [[Confluence]] was based out of Waterdeep."
