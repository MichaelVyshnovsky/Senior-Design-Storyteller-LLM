        "mainbody": "A '''plangent''' was someone whose body was grafted with a prosthetic made from the magically animated mineral, [[plangent crystal]], mined in [[Durpar]].{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|118}}",
        "History": "The first prototype of plangent was [[Warian Datharathi]], who had an arm created by [[Shaddon Datharathi]], his grandfather, after he lost his own in an accident sometime around {{yearlink|1367}}.{{cite book/Darkvision|29|3}}\n\nShaddon continued to experiment with plangents, perfecting them around {{yearlink|1372}}, when he made the transition from weak and insensitive replacements to limbs better than the original.{{cite book/Darkvision|63|7}} and all but two members of the family, Eined and Zeltaebar Datharati, had replaced at least some parts of their bodies with crystal in order to show they stood behind their work.{{cite book/Darkvision|98-99|10}}\n\nUnknown to everyone but Shaddon himself, he had the power to spy on and control just about all plangents created after {{yearlink|1372}}, whose prosthetics were also magically empowered. Unfortunately, the source of power for those applications had turned out to be sentient: an [[Elder Evil]] known as [[Pandorym]], who was in turn capable of controlling Shaddon after the latter replaced most of his body with plangent crystal. Only Warian's prototype arm, fashioned from lesser crystal, was still immune to both his grandfather's control and Pandorym's.{{cite book/Darkvision|152-155|16}} As another horrifying side effect of this connection, once Ususi Manaallin successfully sealed Pandorym on {{yearlink|1374}}, all of the plangent senior members of the Datharathi perished.{{cite book/Darkvision|307|31}}\n\nBy {{yearlink|1383}}, the local practice became known all around Faer√ªn as not only replacing a limb, but also enhancing the plangents' talents in a minor way. Plangents were still being made in {{yearlink|1497}} in Vaelan.",
        "Powers": "Among the products sold, the enhancements were named \"Strong and Tireless\", \"Quick and Vigorous\", \"Insightful and Spellstrong\", \"Pious and Healing\", and \"Cerebral and Ki-Strong\". A whole-body prosthetic was available, with all the enhancements in it, though it was extraordinarily expensive.{{cite book/Darkvision|110-111|11}}\n\n[[Warian Datharathi]]'s arm, the original, had showed a number of new powers despite being a prototype: during his brawl against [[Bui|Bui the Hog]] and [[Yasha]], his speed and strength were boosted beyond his belief,<ref>{{cite book/Darkvision|26-27|3}} at the expense of ensuing bouts of fatigue and weakness.{{cite book/Darkvision|71|7}} The shopkeeper [[Tebora]] at the [[Body Shop]] in [[Vaelan]] considered herself capable of manhandling men for a demonstration of her powers; she also possessed an eye capable of undisclosed scanning,{{cite book/Darkvision|112|11}} and it was related to Warian that plangents of 1374 DR were far stronger than normal people.{{cite book/Darkvision|63|7}} [[Shaddon Datharathi]]'s own full-body prosthetic rendered his skin nearly impenetrable to most weapons{{cite book/Darkvision|221|23}} and he considered it a way of protecting himself against the ravages of old age.{{cite book/Darkvision|196|21}}\n\nThe Datharathi chaka continued to experiment with plangents into {{yearlink|1479}}. Though many of their subjects died, some of them may have discovered new powers in their prosthetics.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Player's Guide|95}}"
