        "mainbody": "'''Icetails''' were a very rare species of [[fish]] found in the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "At first glance, the icetail appeared more like skeletal remains than a living creature, with only fragments of bluish tissue hanging from its ribs. However, a closer examination revealed the presence of a complete body, including a transparent head, fins, and tail resembling glass. The touch of an icefish also emanated an intense coldness, so much so that if someone touches a live icefish with bare skin, they will suffer damage. Once a dead icefish died, it assumed the temperature of its surroundings.",
        "Behavior": "The icetails displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "Icetails inhabited the rivers and seas of the [[Great Glacier]]. Icetails were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands."
