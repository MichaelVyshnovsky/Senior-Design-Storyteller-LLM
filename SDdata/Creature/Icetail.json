        "mainbody": "Icetails were a very rare species of fish found in the Great Glacier.\nAt first glance, the icetail appeared more like skeletal remains than a living creature, with only fragments of bluish tissue hanging from its ribs. However, a closer examination revealed the presence of a complete body, including a transparent head, fins, and tail resembling glass. The touch of an icefish also emanated an intense coldness, so much so that if someone touches a live icefish with bare skin, they will suffer damage. Once a dead icefish died, it assumed the temperature of its surroundings.\nThe icetails displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.\nIcetails could be cooked and consumed, although their raw flesh was exceedingly bitter. However, if they are not thoroughly cooked for at least six hours, the consumer faced the risk of severe indigestion with severe cramps for up to a day.\nIcetails were scavengers. They consumed plankton, organic waste and any organic material.\nIcetails inhabited the rivers and seas of the Great Glacier. Icetails were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands."
