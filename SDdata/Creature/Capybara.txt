Capybaras were large rodents found in Maztican swamps and jungles.
Although slow and lumbering on land, capybaras were relatively fast swimmers, and could hold their breath underwater for up to eight minutes.
Capybaras lived in close proximity to ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, or swamps, and typically didnt stray over  away from a body of water.
While groups of up to eight were most common, some capybaras traveled in herds of over 50.
Tabaxi hunted capybaras for food.
