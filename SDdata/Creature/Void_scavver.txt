Void scavvers were the largest, smartest, and most dangerous of the scavvers&mdashshark-like spaceborne monsters&mdashknown to inhabit wildspace.
Void scavvers had jet black skin. Like other scavvers, they had a single large eye that glowed. With a body some  in length, a void scavver could easily swallow a man. Its gullet contained a poison that could kill a human in three minutes.
Void scavvers had superb senses even invisible creatures were easily detectable by them.
Unlike other varieties of scavver, which were primarily scavengers, void scavvers were primarily carnivores. They would hunt the crew of ships, not just their scraps and waste. Doors and hatches were not enough to keep a void scavver away the creatures were semi-intelligent and would ram open such portals.
In the wild, void scavvers lived in isolation. They would fight other scavvers away from their territory, and they instinctively knew not to eat brown scavvers, which were poisonous to eat.
