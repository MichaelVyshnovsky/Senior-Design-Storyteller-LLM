A '''unicorn''' was a mysterious and majestic [[magical beast]] resembling a horse with a horn protruding from its forehead.
{{quote
|The unicorn is many things... Mortals see it and call it shy, fierce, proud, free, the spirit of magic, the spirit of unconformity, the symbol of purity, truth, change, goodness, chaos, innocence, grace, beauty, secrecy, and a thousand other things. There is truth in each of these, but each of them alone is not enough, and all the words that could be spoken would not a unicorn describe.

==Description==
A unicorn resembled a horse with a white coat, mane, and tail. However, it had a number of traits that distinguished it from a horse, including cloven hooves and a long ivory-colored horn that protruded from its forehead. Males had a white beard.

==Abilities==
Unicorns were not subject to [[poison]], [[death magic]], or ''[[charm]]'' spells. Unicorns were able to sense evil nearby and radiate an aura which protected them from most evil spells. A touch of the unicorn's horn could both heal wounds and cure poison. Unicorns also had the ability to [[teleport]] to nearby locations.

==Varieties==
[[File:Unicorn 2e mm.png|thumb|''A beautiful and graceful unicorn.'']]
There several varieties of unicorn recorded in Faerun besides the so-called "regular" unicorn (or sylvan unicorn, according to some scholars).<ref>{{Cite dragon/190/Unique Unicorns|91}}

;Black unicorn: 
[[Black unicorn]]s were the evil counterparts of regular unicorns. They were created through magical breeding programs by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].

;Celestial charger:
[[Celestial charger]]s were unicorns from [[Celestia]] that were the enemies of all evil creatures that would destroy woodlands.

;Dusk unicorn:
[[Dusk unicorn]]s were a rare, dark-colored variant considered auspicious by fey.

;Sea unicorn:
Sea unicorns were a rumored variety of aquatic unicorn found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], resembling a [[hippocampus]] with a horn.

Additionally, there were certain depraved rituals that required removing the horn of a living unicorn. Most of the time, the unicorn so violated only survived a short time, but in some cases they went mad and, under a mild demonic influence, transformed into a horror called a [[bloodlance]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/357/Defiled Monsters|46-48}}

==Combat==
Unicorns attacked primarily by impaling foes on their horns, although they could also use their hooves as weapons.

==Society==
Unicorns dwelt deep within their forests and shunned most creatures, only conferring with [[fey]] such as [[pixie]]s, [[dryad]]s, and [[sprite]]s. They usually showed themselves only in defense of their forests. They scratched glyphs into the bark of trees in the areas under their protection.

Unicorns mated for life.

Unicorns that rested at the [[Place of the Unicorn]], sacred to the unicorn goddess [[Lurue]], in the [[Sword Mountains]] were healed of all injury and disease.

==Habitats==
[[File:Unicorn.png|thumb|right|250px|''A unicorn and her foal.'']]
At least 100 unicorns could be found in the [[High Forest]], as well as a few down through the [[Unicorn Run]]. Unicorns were most likely to be seen near the [[Sisters]] waterfalls, where seeing them and the moon rise above the cliffs were seen as a sign of good fortune from the goddess [[Mielikki]]. Other locations home to unicorns included the [[Forgotten Forest]].

===Relationships===
Unicorns were often sent as servants of [[Corellon|Corellon Larethian]], [[Eldath]], [[Isis]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Lurue]], [[Mielikki]], [[Mystra]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], [[Sheela Peryroyl]], [[Silvanus]], [[Solonor Thelandira]], and [[Tymora]] to aid their worshipers.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

===Usages===
Unicorn horns were reputed to have magical and healing properties.

Unicorn horns were considered a status symbol by wealthy [[demon]]s of the [[Abyss]]. These gruesome items were used as post-meal [[toothpick]]s.

==History==
A cavalry of 50-100 "unicornriders" existed in ancient [[Cormanthyr]].

During the [[Shoon Imperium|Shoon Dynasty]], rulers experimented on unicorns in an attempt to discover the secrets of eternal youth. A herd of unicorns used to inhabit [[Shilmista]] before they and the [[elf|elves]] that tended them were slaughtered in [[355 DR]] by Necroqysar [[Shoon  VII]] for use in the [[Tome of the Unicorn]] and the [[Staff of Shoon]].

In the [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], inhumanely shackled and clamped unicorns could be found in the Stockyards of [[Samora]], [[Azzagrat]], chained and manacled around their necks to stakes driven deep into the ground, heavy metal harnesses preventing them from teleporting away or even lifting their heads as they awaited being slaughtered and eaten by influential residents of the Abyss such as [[Graz'zt]]'s loyal servant [[Maretta]], Lady of the Counting-House.

==Notable Unicorns==
