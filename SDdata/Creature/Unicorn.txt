A unicorn was a mysterious and majestic magical beast resembling a horse with a horn protruding from its forehead.
A unicorn resembled a horse with a white coat, mane, and tail. However, it had a number of traits that distinguished it from a horse, including cloven hooves and a long ivory-colored horn that protruded from its forehead. Males had a white beard.
Unicorns were not subject to poison, death magic, or charm spells. Unicorns were able to sense evil nearby and radiate an aura which protected them from most evil spells. A touch of the unicorns horn could both heal wounds and cure poison. Unicorns also had the ability to teleport to nearby locations.

At least 100 unicorns could be found in the High Forest, as well as a few down through the Unicorn Run. Unicorns were most likely to be seen near the Sisters waterfalls, where seeing them and the moon rise above the cliffs were seen as a sign of good fortune from the goddess Mielikki. Other locations home to unicorns included the Forgotten Forest.
Unicorns were often sent as servants of Corellon Larethian, Eldath, Isis, Labelas Enoreth, Lurue, Mielikki, Mystra, Rillifane Rallathil, Sheela Peryroyl, Silvanus, Solonor Thelandira, and Tymora to aid their worshipers.

In the 1370s DR, inhumanely shackled and clamped unicorns could be found in the Stockyards of Samora, Azzagrat, chained and manacled around their necks to stakes driven deep into the ground, heavy metal harnesses preventing them from teleporting away or even lifting their heads as they awaited being slaughtered and eaten by influential residents of the Abyss such as Grazzts loyal servant Maretta, Lady of the Counting-House.
