'''Forest hags''' were a subspecies of [[green hag]]s that inhabited the the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
Forest hags appeared to be lanky, almost skeletal [[monstrous humanoid]] women of similar weight and height to an average [[human]], with green skin and long dirty hair, dressed in torn scraps and wearing jewelry and trinkets made of bone. Their mouths were filled with misshapen browned teeth, appendages ended in blood red claws, and eyes glowed with malicious radiance.

==Combat==
Like other hags, forest hags took on the guise of a mortal [[humanoid]] to lure their victims to their doom. They had access to magic and could render themselves hard to grasp via a [[spell]]-like ability to turn [[blur]]ry. They were vulnerable to magic and [[cold iron]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of forest hags lurked in the King's Forest south of the village of [[Eveningstar]] in Cormyr. One notable elder forest hag, [[Grundlehin]], and her coven including the [[night hag]] [[Frelga]], laired in a deep dark cavern underneath a ravaged farmhouse outside of Eveningstar. Her coven was confronted by a band of [[adventurer]]s from [[Eberron]] after the [[War Wizard]] [[Barthand]] disappeared into the cavern.
