'''Butu''' were a crossbred species of [[kobold]]s and [[bakemono]] found in the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]] who were brought to the region by the [[Nubari (ancient)|Ancients]], before the split of [[Abeir-Toril]].

==Description==
Butu heritage was evident from their features, a mix of both kobold and bakemono. Like bakemono, they had hairy [[mountain goat]]-like hoofed legs, while their torsos and muzzles resembled that of a kobold, with the main difference being goat-like horns. Males and females showed little difference in appearance and grew to reach {{SI|3'6|'"|long=yes}} tall. One in ten males appeared to be bigger and stronger specimen and often were the leaders of their clans.

==Abilities==
Butu mountain goat legs allowed them to dexterously navigate rocky class and mountains, making them an uneasy prey for Malatran predators.

They possessed limited ''[[infravision]]'' that reached up to {{SI|30'|'"|long=yes}} but were perfectly capable and content in the bright daylight.

==Combat==
Avoiding confrontation was most common among butu. However, defending their homes and families, they fought fiercely, often paving an escape path for their weaker kin. They prepared for battle by planning [[trap]]s and ambushes while preferring subterfuge and overpowering their foes with great numbers. Most common weapons wielded by butu were [[club]]s, stone [[knives]], [[short bow]]s, [[spear]]s and [[javelin]]s. They entered battle using range and thrown weapons and went into melee after exhausting ranged options. In close combat, butu tended to find themselves caught up in a moment and acting with extreme impulsiveness. The initial charge was done headfirst, literally. Butu used their horned heads to charge and head-butt their opponents. A swarm of butu could easily overpower and knock down even large creatures and push opponents off cliffs and slopes when possible.

Butu often huddled down as a defense mechanism, pretending to be a harmless, scared, trembling creature. Many were easily fooled by that strategy, but it also made the huddled creatures the desired target for hungry predators of the Malatran jungles.

==Personality==
Butu were survivalist and independent creatures. They were friendly, enjoying meeting new people but were hard to befriend and trust others.

The ancestral lore and stories of butu talked about the great [[Cataclysm]] that killed most of the Ancient masters. Since then, butu believed that magic was dangerous when handled irresponsibly.{{Cite polyhedron/121/The Living Jungle Just Got Livelier|3-4}}

==Society==
They were nomadic creatures living in communities that resembled herds of mountain goats. Each heard, referred to as a clan, usually consisted of between four and twenty-four male butu and an equal number of females. Individual butu did not possess much and only owned what they could carry around. On very rare occasions, non-butu were allowed to travel with the herds, but due to their uncanny ability to navigate cliffs and slopes, non-butu often plummeted to their deaths.

Butu coexisted in peace with other creatures found on the mountain slopes, such as [[bighorn sheep]] and mountain goats, who, in turn, offered early stranger or predator detection. These tribes were hunter-gatherers, feeding on game killed along the travel routes. They were not picky eaters and consumed most edible things, but [[nut]]s roots were the most commonly gathered food. Among butu's natural predators were the flying [[dinosaur]]s of the plateau.

Butu spoke their own [[Butu language|language]] that consisted of ear-piercing yapping barks. Their maws were capable of communicating via other languages, and about half of all butu spoke [[Nubari common]].

[[Obsidian]] was valued greatly among butu for its use in weapon-making. Their armors were crafted from a variety of randomly sewn-together [[leather]]s, furs, and rags.

===Culture===
The name of the species, "butu", did not come from their language. [[Sage]]s speculated that the word was borrowed from the Ancients. Another evidence of that was the presence of a similar word in the dialect used by the [[Simbara]] – the tribe that claimed close relation to the Ancients.

Butu clans started trading with other people of the Living Jungle, namely the [[Saiyama]] that provided butu with a variety of foods and goods from across the region. [[Lizardfolk]] foods such as [[pickle]]d [[bat]]s and cured [[eel]] were butu favorites.

As for religion, butu worshiped the spirits of the land and the butu ancestral spirits. Many clans' preferred worship was that of the fire, air, and earth spirits – patrons of the mountains where butu built their homes. Another common worship was of deceased family members.

==History==
According to ancient legends, a race of kobolds was used as pets of the Ancient ones that arrived in Abeir-Toril, long before the planet was split in two. With time, the kobolds cross-bred with Kara-Turan bakemono, eventually producing butu. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], butu were believed to be extinct; however, they were rediscovered inhabiting rocky and mountainous terrains of the Malatran Plateau. In turn, butu believed all [[Nubari]] to be extinct and that believed lasted until a volcano explosion of the [[Fire Mountain]] in the 14{{th}} century DR, there the [[Tribe of Courage]] resided in seclusion. After the explosion, butu fled down the mountain slopes where they came face to face with the [[human]] Nubari. Butu were impressed by special weapons of ancient [[ceramic]] wielded by the Nubari as they remembered the material from the ancient times and considered it to be precious. Since then, butu joined the peoples of Malatra to work together towards common goals of prosperity.

As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, many butu started building settlements high in the mountains, abandoning their nomadic way of life, and could be seen among other peoples of the jungles and adventurers in the region's lowlands. During that time adventuring butu were known to take on the roles of [[warrior]]s, [[witch doctor]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[rogue]]s bur still preferred to stick to the drier lands of Malatra.
