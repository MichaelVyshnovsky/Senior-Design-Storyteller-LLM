Blood hawks were a species of deadly predatory bird.
Blood hawks were about the same size as a regular hawk with a large wingspan. They had speckled grey feathers. Their beaks and talons were strong and extremely sharp.
Male blood hawks hunted in groups called murders. Blood hawks were more vicious than other birds-of-prey. They possessed an insatiable desire for fresh blood. They were known to attack a target merely for the pleasure they gained from killing.
Blood hawks were very deadly opponents. They were very fast and maneuverable. They were stubborn fighters, continuing to attack a target even if they suffered injuries.
Evil bird maidens in Zakhara were known to shapeshift into blood hawks.
Male blood hawks often took gems from the corpses of their prey, which they used to decorate their nests to attract females.
Blood hawks were obligate carnivores and hunted humanoids, particularly humans. They got their name from their habit of consuming as much fresh blood as possible.
Outside of Faerun, blood hawks were known to be encountered in various deserts in Maztica.
Beyond the Prime Material plane, blood hawks could be found in the plane of Acheron.
