'''Fruitflies''' were magical insects found only in the [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]]. They bolstered the strength and agility of those who ate them.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|55}}

==Description==
Fruitflies were round and resembled any of a number of fruits, such as [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[mango]]s, [[orange]]s, with leaves that were actually wings.

==Abilities==
Fruitflies were swift fliers, quite hardy and difficult to surprise. However, they were quite limited in their options in battle, being unable to cause significant damage.

==Ecology==
Fruitflies perished in the sunlight and were only known to exist in enchanted places such as the Pyramid of Amun-Re. Those who ingested a fruitfly had their strength bolstered, and their agility less so, for one hour.
