Fruitflies were magical insects found only in the Pyramid of Amun-Re. They bolstered the strength and agility of those who ate them.
Fruitflies were round and resembled any of a number of fruits, such as apples, pears, mangos, oranges, with leaves that were actually wings.
Fruitflies were swift fliers, quite hardy and difficult to surprise. However, they were quite limited in their options in battle, being unable to cause significant damage.
Fruitflies perished in the sunlight and were only known to exist in enchanted places such as the Pyramid of Amun-Re. Those who ingested a fruitfly had their strength bolstered, and their agility less so, for one hour.
