        "Description": "Mustevals looked like {{SIAdj|2|foot|adj=tall}} [[humanoid]] mice. They were agile and rarely stayed still. When dealing with other creatures they often used their ''[[change self]]'' ability to appear differently.",
        "Abilities": "Mustevals, like all guardinals, were immune to lightning, resistant to both acid and cold, and could not be petrified. They could speak to any creature that had a language, as if using the spell ''[[tongues]]''. Unlike other guardinals, however, they could not speak with animals.\n\nMustevals also possessed innate magical powers that allowed them to replicate the effects of certain spells. At will, they could replicate the effects of ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[disguise self]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[see invisibility]]''; they could also [[protection from evil|protect themselves from evil]]. Once each day, they could turn [[Invisibility|invisible]].\n\nBesides their magical powers, mustevals were small, agile creatures capable of climbing and burrowing. They also had keen hearing.",
        "Combat": "If required to fight, mustevals preferred to remain in constant motion and relied on their ''magic missile''-like power. If pressed, they would resort to biting.",
        "Society": "Although they were the least powerful variety of guardinal, they used their cunning and small size to help fight evil, often acting as spies and messengers for more powerful [[celestial]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|13}} and some [[Harper paragon]]s could summon them by means of a [[Call faithful servants|powerful summoning spell]] otherwise forbidden to mortals, for as long as a year at a time.",
        "History": "Mustevals were the only guardinal variety who did not have a representative [[Celestial paragon|paragon]] in the [[Talisid and the Five Companions|Five Companions]]. They regarded this as a simple oversight that would soon be corrected."
