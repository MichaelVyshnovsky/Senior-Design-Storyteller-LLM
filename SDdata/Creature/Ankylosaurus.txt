An ankylosaurus (|audio=ankylosaurus.ogg), sometimes called a macetail behemoth or a rock-skin&mdashby the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau&mdashwas a type of dinosaur.
Ankylosaurs were quadruped herbivores. Their bodies were covered in a thick plate armor.
If threatened, ankylosaurs used their knobbed tails to defend themselves against predators. Some varieties had spiked tails instead.
Beyond the Prime Material plane, some could be found in the Forbidden Plateau.
