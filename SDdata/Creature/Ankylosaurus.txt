An '''ankylosaurus''' ({{Pronounce|Ã¦nk|ee|lo|SAR|us|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}|audio=ankylosaurus.ogg}}), sometimes called a '''macetail behemoth''' or a '''rock-skin'''&mdash;by the inhabitants of the [[Malatran Plateau]]&mdash;was a type of [[dinosaur]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], some could be found in the [[Forbidden Plateau (divine realm)|Forbidden Plateau]].

==Notable Ankylosaurs==
* [[Grung Stomper]], a racing ankylosaurus from [[Port Nyanzaru]].
