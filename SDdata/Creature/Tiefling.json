        "Description": {
            "Tiefling Bloodlines": "[[File:Scion_of_Stygia.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A tiefling descended from a [[devil]] from [[Stygia]].]]\nThe physical appearance of a tiefling often depended on the exact ancestry that spawned it, a bloodline that might have remained dormant for generations. Diabolic or demonic tieflings could, besides the common horns and tails, possess a forked tongue, leathery or scaly skin, the smell of brimstone, or unusually warm flesh. Some accounts even held these tieflings to cast neither shadows nor reflections. Some diabolic tieflings also sported goat-like legs or hooves. Tieflings descended from [[rakshasa]] might have furred skin or feline eyes. Those descended from [[night hag]]s could have small horns, glowing red eyes, or bruised, blue skin. Most tieflings had only one or two of these features.\n\nSome tieflings were not descended from mere fiends at all, but from powerful [[god]]s. These tieflings often had their own physical characteristics that set them apart. Tieflings sired by [[Beshaba]], for instance, often had antlers instead of horns and pale, white hair. Those sired by [[Mask]], on the other hand, were known for their tendency to cast no reflection.\n\nIn [[Mulhorand]], the most common tieflings were often those spawned from a union with [[Set]] or [[Sebek]]. Most tieflings were, however, the grandchildren or even great-grandchildren of fiends and in Mulhorand's neighbor, [[Thay]], most tieflings were spawned deliberately by powerful [[wizard]]s as part of some elaborate plot for power.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], a [[warlock]] coven known as the [[Toril thirteen]] performed a [[ritual]] that cursed most tiefling lineages—those of demons, devils, [[hag]]s, and rakshasas, among others—with the \"blood of [[Asmodeus]]\", changing their original lineage with that of the [[archdevil]] himself. This was done to make Asmodeus a \"racial god\", ensuring him enough followers to attain godly powers. After the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], when Asmodeus became a god, the magic of the ritual took effect across all of [[Toril]] and afterwards most tieflings living in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] were of the Asmodean lineage, all having a similar devilish appearance.\n\nPrior to Asmodeus's ascension to godhood, the infernal blood could be diluted through intermarriage, but afterward, the union of a tiefling with another race always produced a tiefling child.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|5292}}\n\nIn the late years of the 15{{th}} century, tieflings of other bloodlines began to be born again, but the [[Asmodeus|Asmodean]] lineage was still the most numerous by a wide margin at the time."

        "Personality": "Tieflings had a number of abilities gifted to them by their fiendish heritage. By and large, tieflings were alluring and intelligent creatures, with a seductive aura in spite of their obviously evil ancestry. To a large degree, tieflings were more capable of guile than a great number of races, but these were not their dominant qualities.\n\n[[File:Valor Singer AFR.jpg|thumb|left|A tiefling [[bard]] singing in battle.]]\nMost tieflings were aware from an early age that they were different from others around them, and would give in to strange urges and desires because of their unusual ancestry. Few tieflings were raised with the love a normal human child might expect to receive and this shaped most of the race into bitter individuals who expected eventual rejection from all whom they meet. While some would follow this path towards evil, others rejected it wholeheartedly and sought to make a good impact on the world around them, sometimes becoming the most heroic characters of all. Few could maintain this discipline however, and most tieflings fell somewhere between both extremes.\n{{fq\n| width  = 250px\n|text=Don't ever make a bet with a tiefling.\n|source=Planar Proverb\n}}\nBecause tieflings were generally distrusted throughout the world, owing to their fiendish heritage, many were themselves distrusting and self-reliant.

However, members of other races would find that once they demonstrated friendship and trust towards a tiefling, it would quickly be reciprocated in full. Once that bond was forged, it was rarely broken.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Oathofglory.png|thumb|A tiefling [[Oath of Glory]] [[paladin]].]]\nTieflings were talented warriors. In melee combat they were agile and quick on their feet. They preferred to use weapons that combined sharpness with speed. They commonly used [[hand crossbow]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[longsword]]s, [[ranseur]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[stiletto]]s. Most tieflings were [[ambidextrous]] and as a result favored a two-hand fighting style. Tieflings preferred to wear light armor and rarely used [[shield]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Those tieflings who sought power through [[arcane magic]] were most often [[warlock]]s. Tiefling [[arcane spellcaster]]s of all kinds, however, felt a draw towards the fiendish energies of the planes and tiefling [[wizard]]s commonly specialized as [[divination|diviners]] for the purposes of seeking knowledge of the Lower Planes or as [[conjuration|conjurers]] so that they might summon the dark spirits whom they called kin.\n\nTieflings had an innate resistance to heat and had a hint of bloodlust that gave them a slight edge in combat. Tieflings also had access to an ability known as ''[[infernal wrath]]'', which channeled their innate rage and potential for evil into their attacks for added effectiveness.\n\nSome tieflings also had the innate ability to cast a ''[[darkness]]'' [[spell]], though not all of the race exhibited this trait.",
        "Society": {
            "Relations with other races": "Tieflings, in general, didn't get along well with the other races of the world and were slow to trust others of any race, even their own. This animosity that tieflings had for others was taken to its extreme in the case of [[aasimar]], whom tieflings instinctively feared or loathed. Devas often had a similar reaction, making it difficult for members of either race to successfully interact with each other. Of all the common races, tieflings felt the most kinship with [[half-orc]]s, who were similarly a target of revulsion and hate.\n\n[[File:Tiefling Sam-Wood FRCS3e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''A tiefling monk.'']]"
        },
        "Ecology": "Tieflings were carnivores. They consumed blood, blubber, bone, gristle and meat. They even roasted insects and considered raw bone marrow a delicacy.",
        "History": "In ancient times, the tieflings used to rule an empire that warred with an ancient empire ruled by the [[dragonborn]]. Even though the races had a long tradition of \"enmity\", those empires existed so long ago that dragonborn considered such enmity more theoretical than practical.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|Chapter 2}}<ref group=\"note\">The ancient empires of the dragonborn and tieflings seems to be a reference to [https://dnd4.fandom.com/wiki/Arkhosia Arkhosia] and Bael Turath, two ancient empires that existed in the world [[Nerath]]. While Nerath is the setting of \"core\" 4th Edition, and there is no evidence in Realmslore of said empires existing in the past history of [[Abeir-Toril]], the lore of said empires mentions that they build some colonies in other worlds and planes. Perhaps the history of these ancient empires was learned by the dragonborn and tieflings of the Realms from these places.",
        "Homelands": "Being the result of fiendish interference with humans, tieflings had no true homeland and were found throughout Toril. The race was particularly common, however, in Mulhorand and [[Unther]] before both nations were devastated by the Spellplague, though the latter's population was said to have been vastly exaggerated. Tieflings also once had a large presence in [[Thay]], where many were slaves. Tieflings who were discovered in the land often became pawns in the struggles between Thay's [[zulkir]]s, whom they served as assassins, thieves, and spies. The takeover by [[Szass Tam]], however drove many out of the region.\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century, tieflings were most commonly found in [[Narfell]] and [[High Imaskar]], though many were also welcome in [[Tymanther]], thanks to the native dragonborn's policy of racial tolerance. Other tieflings allied themselves with the [[genasi]] servants of [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] in [[Calimshan]], where they were a valued addition to the [[efreeti]]'s war against his rival [[Calim]]. Many tieflings were also found along the [[Sword Coast]], particularly in the cosmopolitan [[Baldur's Gate]], as well as parts of the [[Dragon Coast]]. In [[Aglarond]], the race was only begrudgingly tolerated as enemies of Thay.",
