        "mainbody": "Black burners were an uncommon species of aquatic mammal found in the Great Glacier.\nThe black burner was a small marine mammal. It has a chubby black body, a puckered blowhole, and a wide mouth, resembling a miniature whale. It secreted oil through tiny pores in its skin. The entire surface of the black burner was covered in oil, which prevented it from freezing when taken out of the water.\nBlack burners displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.\nBlack burners were scavengers. They consumed plankton, organic waste and any organic material.\nBlack burners inhabited the rivers and seas of the Great Glacier. Black burners were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes.\nIf the corpse of a black burner was set on fire, it burned steadily for up to twelve hours, providing light and warmth similar to a small campfire. Approximately a cup of oil could be drained from a black burner corpse and saved for future use as fuel."
