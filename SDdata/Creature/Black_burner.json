        "mainbody": "'''Black burners''' were an uncommon species of aquatic mammal found in the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "The black burner was a small marine mammal. It has a chubby black body, a puckered blowhole, and a wide mouth, resembling a miniature [[whale]]. It secreted [[oil]] through tiny pores in its skin. The entire surface of the black burner was covered in oil, which prevented it from freezing when taken out of the water.",
        "Behavior": "Black burners displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "Black burners inhabited the rivers and seas of the [[Great Glacier]]. Black burners were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes."
        },
        "Uses": "If the corpse of a black burner was set on fire, it burned steadily for up to twelve hours, providing light and warmth similar to a small campfire. Approximately a cup of oil could be drained from a black burner corpse and saved for future use as fuel."
