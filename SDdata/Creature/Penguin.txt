Penguins were aquatic flightless birds. They lived on the floes of the Sea of Moving Ice and in Alpuk.
An average penguin could hold its breath for about 6 minutes.
The penguins of the Sea of Moving Ice were preyed upon by polar bears and walruses. Those in Alpuk were hunted by Iulutiuns, who ate them raw and considered them among their favorite birds as food.
