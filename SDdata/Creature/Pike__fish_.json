        "mainbody": "ikes were a species of resilient carnivorous freshwater fish, prized gamefish, and mundane housing of giant pikes.\nPikes mouths were filled with dangerous and sharp teeth, a threat to their prey and anglers.\n*Northern pike a subspecies of pike found in the far northern Sea of Moving Ice and unlike its freshwater cousins, northern pikes lived in cold brackish waters.\nPikes were known for their aggression and powerful acrobatics when reeled by fishermen in.\nPikes, along with other species of gamefish inhabited Doffs Lake of the Veilstone Peaks, Cormyr. The lake teemed with life and provided the surrounding villages with abundant fish.\nThe waters of Akanamere bore seasonally-rich populations of fish. The fisherfolk of the city of Zutria had to compete with pikes for the catch. Thankfully, they often were helped by friendly nixies who chased the sharp-teethed predators away from the catch in exchange for dried beef and squeeze bulbs of wine.\nThe Oeblaun fishermen often told stories of freshwater pikes and eels that dwelt in the River Scelptar. These water beasts were big enough to swallow a human whole. These stories, however, were likely nothing but fishers telltales."
