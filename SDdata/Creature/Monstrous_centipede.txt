'''Monstrous centipedes''' were venomous, subterranean arthropods of giant size.

==Description==
Monstrous centipedes ranged from [[halfling]]-size to as big as the largest [[dragon]]s. Their bodies ranged in color from pale grey, black, red, and brown.

Monstrous centipedes were adept at climbing nearly any surface with their many legs.

==Behavior==
These creatures were very aggressive and liable to attack anything that could be food.

==Combat==
When attacking, a monstrous centipede would rush towards its prey and use its jaws. When it bit, it injected a sort of [[poison]] that reduced a prey's mobility. This poison was weak though and not liable to be fatal.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], giant centipedes were sold as fish bait at [[Skully's Bar and Bait]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite polyhedron/46/The Living City: Skully's Bar and Bait|16}}

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Monstrous centipedes could be found almost anywhere, but typically they were encountered deep underground. 

On the surface they were known to infest the fens, moors, and deciduous forests of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. They were also known to infest the [[Vast Swamp]] between [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]], the forests of [[Cormanthor]], and the sewers of [[Waterdeep]].

They were known to frequently be found in the steppes of the [[Hordelands]], as well as its forests [[Ama Basin]], [[Hagga Shan]], and [[Shalhoond]]. They were also a common occurrence in its deserts, the [[Raurin]] and [[Quoya Desert|Quoya]].
===Relationships===
Evil spellcasters often [[Summon monster|summoned]] [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] monstrous centipedes from the [[Lower Planes]] to fight for them.
