'''Dung snakes''' were a species of aquatic [[constrictor snake]]. They were among the species considered [[:Category:Serpents|serpents]].<ref>

==Description==
Dung snakes had brown scales that were coated in a slime that gave off a strong odour.

==Biology==
When faced with cold weather conditions, the body of a dung snake would exude a protective slime around itself. This slime provided dung snakes with a measure of resistance to cold. They also had a natural immunity to disease and were capable of quickly healing from an injury.

==Combat==
Dung snakes attacked their prey while in water. They wrapped themselves around its prey, constricting and dragging them underwater. They anchored themselves to its prey by biting them with their sharp fangs. Once submerged, dung snakes held on to its prey until they drowned.

==Ecology==
Dung snakes got their name from their instinct to seek out warmth in compost piles and [[dung]] heaps when the weather turned cold. They would burrow deep into these compost piles, dung heaps, cesspools, or other source of decomposition-based warmth and sleep there until either disturbed or warm weather returned to the local area.
===Habitat===
Dung snakes were found in cesspools, marshes and wetlands. They were known to live within the [[Marsh of Chelimber]], the [[Rat Hills]] and the [[River Sargauth]] in [[Undermountain]].
===Uses===
Dung snakes were a common [[familiar]] used by spellcasters.
