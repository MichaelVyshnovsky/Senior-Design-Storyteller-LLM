'''Dire horse''' were bigger and wilder relatives of normal [[horse]]s notable for their aggression and sheer strength.

==Description==
The beasts appear as huge versions of normal wild horses with wild unkempt manes and bone plates growing out of the sides of their heads. Their hooves had deadly jagged edges.

==Abilities==
Powerful beasts, dire horses could carry loads of up to {{SI|1557|lb|k|long=yes}} and drag even more, up to {{SI|7785|lb|k|long=yes}}. They had a keen  sense of smell, capable of detecting foes and use it for tracking.

==Combat==
When confronted, dire horses tended to stomp at the enemies with their jagged hooves and with a bite right after.

==Ecology==
Dire horses could be found solitarily and in herds of six and up to thirty beasts. Being completely wild animals, dire horses were extremely hard to domesticate or tame due to their aggressive bestial nature.

Dire horses were known to inhabit the lands of [[Shaar]], [[Murghôm]], and [[Semphar]]. Their fierce nature and fearsome power led to several cults sprouting to worship the creatures, as well as numerous legends and folktales, and ghost stories were weaved about the dire horses of these regions.

==Notable==
[[Yeenoghu]], the [[Demon]] Prince of [[Gnoll]]s, was known to ride dire horses.
