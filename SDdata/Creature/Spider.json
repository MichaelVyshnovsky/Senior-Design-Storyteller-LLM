In cultures that venerated Lolth, it was forbidden to kill a spider; those who did so were punished with death. \nSpiders were often kept by the drow, their purpose depending on a given spider's size. The smallest ones were kept as pets by children. Those that were big enough to kill [[mice]], meaning hand-sized, were kept as [[familiar]]s by [[wizard]]s. Those that were as big as a [[horse]] were used to ride upon. Those that were the size of [[dog]]s were used like guard dogs in temples to [[Lolth]]. The last category were sometimes imbued with a [[demon]] to make older ones regain their vitality, combining it with a nasty personality.{{Cite web/Drow Pets and Animal Companions}}\n\n[[Spriggan]]s in the [[Feywild]] were sometimes known to use spiders to create web barriers in their forests.",
            "Usages": "* Some drow would ceremonially eat a spider at the beginning of each meal as a way of giving thanks to Lolth.\n* [[Hishnashaper]]s often kept spiders and parts of spiders for use in [[hishna|their magic]]. Such as their venom acting as a [[material component]] for the [[spell]] ''[[pestilence]]''."
