'''Giant toads''' were monstrous varieties of the mundane animals of the [[toad|same name]].

==Description==
In terms of physical description, giant toads completely matched normal toads, except in size.{{Cite dragon/247/Dragon's Bestiary: The Anurans|88}} or "warty" as some described it, often rough to the touch. However, their appearance varied between species. The base species of giant toad has colorations ranging from weak brown to iron red.

On average the base species of giant toad grew up to be {{SI|5|ft}} in length.

==Abilities==
Due to their extended size, a giant toad could jump up to {{SI|10|ft}} high, and across gaps that were {{SI|20|ft}} wide, even from being completely stationary.

==Sub-Species==
[[File:Giant toad 2e.png|thumb|''A red-skinned dangerous giant toad caught in mid-croak.'']]
;[[Fire toad]]
: A variety of giant toad that was capable of launching [[fireball]]s from its mouth. Unlike other giant toad species, they had hydrophobia rather than a fear of fire.
;[[Ice toad]]
: A highly intelligent variety of giant toad that were adapted for life in cold habitats.
;[[Poisonous toad]]
: A variety of giant toad that largely looked the same as the mundane variety. However, their bodies secreted a type of [[poison]] through their skin. They were less common than the standard giant toad.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Giant toads were a carnivorous species, liable to attempt to devour anything that appeared edible. They were often attracted to settled areas, where they preyed upon livestock such as [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, and even [[sheep]].
===Habitats===
Giant toads preferred to live in temperate areas with bodies of water they could lay their eggs in. Though they were species that survived in rather cool or dry environments.

They often made their homes underground, enjoying both the damp air and steady supply of food such environments offered them. Because of this, they occasionally be found within the sewers of cities.

In [[northwest Faer没n]], giant toads could be found within the [[Mere of Dead Men]].{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, "the Black Death"}} In [[interior Faer没n]] they could be found in the [[Farsea Marshes]], the [[Marsh of Tun]], and the [[Vast Swamp]]. In [[southeast Faer没n]] they could be found in the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]].

Beyond [[Faer没n]], they could be found in the prairie regions of [[Semphar]].
