'''Verbeegs''' ({{Pronounce|vur|BEEGZ|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}}; {{Plural|verbeeg|refs=}} {{Plural|verbeegs|alt=yes|refs=}}) were [[giant-kin]] and were also sometimes known as '''human behemoths''' because they resembled [[human]]s more than any other giant race.

==Description==
Verbeegs greatly resembled humans, but had gangly limbs and elongated faces.

==Personality==
Verbeegs were usually [[neutral evil|evil creatures without an ethical compass]].

While being conniving, these giants still possessed a certain sense of honor. They often followed their own rules: never give a sucker a break, and always keep your word. Verbeegs often worded their promises and turns of phrase so they were able to get out of pledging things they did not want to follow up on.

==Combat==
Verbeegs were known to craft their own armor and weaponry, with thrown [[spear]]s being preferred above all else. With many being accomplished spear-fighters. Those with minions were known to send them into battle first, softening up their adversaries before joining the fray themselves.

They used their cunning intelligence to mislead their prey by playing on their expectations—mimicking in their actions and speech both [[ogre]]s and [[hill giant]]s. When the victims of deception assumed perceived superiority or thinking the verbeeg outwitted, the giants turned the tables on them. They often manipulated the prey's honor, fairness, and justice using them against the victims.

==Society==
The treacherous nature of verbeegs made such treachery the primary skill where the [[ordning (social structure)|ordning]] was concerned. To advance in ranks, a verbeeg had to discredit or defeat a superior, by violence or any other means.

Verbeegs had no concept of ownership and believed that everything was owned by everyone, so they took whatever they wanted without pause to think about it.

===Lycanthropy===
Due to their close resemblance to humans, the verbeeg were known to be highly susceptible to all forms of [[lycanthropy]], though somehow they were immune to being afflicted with the [[wereraven]] form of the condition.{{Cite dragon/266/Dragon's Bestiary: Giant Lycanthropes}}

Compared to the other giant races, verbeegs were known to be the most violent when it came to one of their own contracting lycanthropy. As they would actively hunt down and kill any member of their tribe that became afflicted with the condition.

===Homelands===
Verbeeg preferred to dwell in forlorn places. Because of this, they often shared the same territory as hill giants and ogres.

Some were known to be found in the temperate mountains of [[Cormyr]], whilst many others lived in the cold mountain ranges of [[northwest Faerûn]], such as the [[Ice Mountains]], the [[Spine of the World]], the [[Ice Spires]], and forlorn region of [[Icewind Dale]].  

===Religion===
Verbeeg primarily worshiped the god [[Karontor]], considering him their patron deity.<ref> Though they did not worship him out of any sense of true faith, but rather out of hopes that he could bring them into the ordning. Even the [[priest]]s of Karontor were likely to abandon him if a better option came to them.

Some verbeeg, called Longstriders, worshiped various nature deities and were in turn blessed with magical spellcasting.

===Relationships===
It was not unusual for verbeegs to bully the giants of lower intellect, like hill giants and ogres, becoming leaders of gangs of them.

Verbeegs enjoyed the company of mammalian beasts, often letting wild ones such as [[bear]]s and [[wolves]] take up residence in their lairs. They were also known to catch and keep domesticated animals for food and trade, such as [[cattle]], [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[sheep]].

Some verbeeg were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of the deity [[Mask]].

==History==
The verbeeg race was created when [[Othea]], wife of the giant deity [[Annam All-Father]], had an affair with [[Ulutiu]]. Like all the giant-kin races, they were never granted a portion of land by Annam from which to found their own "dynasty" inside the kingdom of [[Ostoria]]. They were initially welcomed by their fellow giants and learned their ways, but once their true parentage was discovered by Annam he cast them out. They became excluded from the societies of [[true giant]]s, despite Othea's best efforts to protect them. The verbeegs did not take this lying down, endeavoring to build their own works of art and cities, but the true giants allow them no place within their borders. This was especially the case with the [[storm giant]]s and [[titan]]s.

As centuries passed verbeegs became more savage and vicious, until they were barely recognizable from what they once were.

Later, a band of verbeegs in the Ice Spires launched raids on the [[frost giant]]s and managed to gather aid from the [[fomorian]]s and [[voadkyn]] in the area, which was notable because the [[giant-kin]] did not often interact with other giant-kin races.

Karontor sent his avatar into all the verbeeg tribes many years before the mid–14th century [[DR]] and, without revealing his true identity, recruited many scouts to keep him informed of the events occurring around [[Faerûn]], as well as collecting artifacts for his unknown ends.

==Notable Verbeegs==
* [[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]] of [[Lyndusfarne]]
* [[Logroller]], a male verbeeg who worked as a foreman at the [[Mooney & Sons Circus]].
