'''Giant crayfishes''' were a type of very large crustacean.These core sources &mdash; ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' on page 50, ''[[Monstrous Compendium Volume Two]]'' on page 29, and the 1{{st}} edition [[Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition|''Dungeon Masters Guide'']] on pages 180 & 224 &mdash; all state that [[crayfish]] and [[lobster]]s are the same thing. While crayfish are similar to lobsters and are even colloquially known as "freshwater lobsters," they are distinct creatures.

==Description==
These creatures were six-limbed, low-bodied crustaceans whose bodies typically measured {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} or more in length. They were rather slow walkers, though very fast swimmers.

==Combat==
Much like a [[giant crab]], giant crayfish typically hunted by hiding themselves, then rushing out to seize their prey.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
These creatures were an omnivorous species, though primarily subsisted upon [[fish]].

===Habitats===
Giant crayfish were typically found to inhabit wide and deep rivers the [[Stump Bog]],{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}} and the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]].

In the region of [[Kara-tur]], they could be found on the [[Akari|Akari island]] and the river adjacent to the town of [[Kataburi]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], giant crayfish were rumored to be found in [[Phlegethon]].

===Relationships===
The meat of giant crayfish was considered a delicacy by many creatures, especially among [[nixie]]s. [[Dragon turtle]]s, [[giant gar]]s, [[giant otter]]s, [[giant pike]]s, [[giant snapping turtle]]s, [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]]s, and [[storm giant]]s were all known to hunt and prey upon them.
