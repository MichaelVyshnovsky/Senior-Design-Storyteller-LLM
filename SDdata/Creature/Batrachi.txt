The '''batrachi''', also called '''amphibioids''', were an ancient amphibious race that were counted as one of the [[creator races]] native to [[Abeir-Toril]], who dominated the supercontinent of [[Merrouroboros]] during the [[Days of Thunder]].

==Description==
They were thought to be an aquatic and amphibious race and were capable of shapeshifting.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 9}}

==History==
This amphibious race evolved in the seas, their growth mirroring the dinosauroids on land. When they became amphibious, they moved onto the land and supplanted the dinosauroids.

The batrachi came to prominence during the Days of Thunder ({{Yearlink|-35000}} to {{Yearlink|-30000}}), following the time of the [[sarrukh]]. The Batrachi Empires rose to power ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-33500}}.

The batrachi grew to the height of their power under the wise leadership of [[Zhoukoudien]], the High One. However, their golden age ended abruptly when the High One was killed in battle by [[Omo]], a [[titan]] thane of the Jotunbrud Tribes, around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. The batrachi lord [[Bazim-Gorag]] later called Zhoukoudien a fool who unwisely made war against the [[Jotunbrud]] and lost the empire.

Around {{Yearlink|-31000}}, The primordial [[Asgorath]], the World Shaper, even hurled an ice moon or comet at the planet, in order to destroy what she could not have, in an event called the [[Tearfall]]. Disastrous earthquakes, fires, and windstorms swept across all of [[Abeir-Toril]], erasing whole continents and rearranging the seas. Ancient sarrukh legends made cryptic mention of the "changing of the stars". But, before the world was destroyed, [[Ao]] split it into two twin worlds: [[Abeir]] for the primordials and [[Toril]] for the gods.

[[File:Bazim-Gorag.jpg|thumb|right|''Bazim-Gorag, the Firebringer, a much-mutated batrachi lord, turned slaad, turned something else.'']]
The extreme climate change swiftly led to the end of batrachi civilization. After a cold period called the seven-turn winter, many batrachi—among them Bazim-Gorag—left Toril for the [[plane]] of [[Limbo]]. There, the batrachi were changed, for at least the second time in their history, by their god Ramenos to serve his agenda. They created what became known as the [[Supreme Throne]] as their kingdom.

Meanwhile, in the seas, the amphibioids appear to have faced pressure from [[merfolk]], [[sahuagin]], and [[triton]]s. Their society degenerated and collapsed back into barbarism.

===Legacy===
The transformed batrachi lived on in Limbo, but were often confused with the similarly amphibious [[slaad]]i who also dwelt there.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Cosmologies, Limbo, and the Prime}} Some thought the [[Pandemonium Stone]] in the [[Elemental Chaos]] was a batrachi artifact and furthermore that examining it would reveal the truth of whether the slaadi had descended from the batrachi. Bazim-Gorag was Lord of the Pandemonium Stone and an ascended batrachi invoked by gamblers and those desperate for luck.

In the {{YearlinkName|-350}}, [[Haask, Voice of Hargut|Haask]], priest-king of [[Grong-Haap]], reigning from [[Ironfang Keep]], was revealed to be not a [[greathorn minotaur]] but a batrachi-doppelganger hybrid, when attacked and mortally wounded.<ref>{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep}}

The debased descendants of the remaining batrachi lived on in the deepest, darkest swamps of [[Faerûn]], but were presumed long extinct by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

However, the batrachi created or were the ancestors of a number of the amphibious, piscine, and shapeshifting races of the Realms, including the bullywugs, doppelgangers, and kuo-toa.

An intricate runic design theorized to have originated among the batrachi was used by the [[Imaskari]] in the construction of their [[Bukhara Spires]], during their Early Dynastic Period ({{Yearlink|-7975}} to {{Yearlink|-6422}}). Employing transdimensional magic, these were permanent two-way ''[[portal]]s'' that allowed the Imaskari to cross the continent in moments.

A memory of a conversation between Bazim-Gorag the Firebringer and a [[human]] member of the [[Order of the Black Flame]], in which he spoke of the batrachi, found its way into the [[God-Brain]] of [[Oryndoll]] when that member was captured and mind-read by the [[illithid]]s in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

At their height, the [[Batrachi Empires]] spread across the whole of the supercontinent of [[Merrouroboros]], Bazim-Gorag described his domain as "stretching from the depths of the Black Sea in the north to the fiery peaks of [[Lopango]] in the south".

They built proud cities on the land.

==Deity==
The batrachi of the Ba'etith at the Hall of Mists and those who later lived in the Supreme Throne At least twice he had changed the batrachi to serve his goals.

==Society==
Like the sarrukh before them and the [[aearee]] after them, the batrachi once dominated the group known as the [[Ba'etith]] during the Days of Thunder. Its purpose was to record and study the primitive [[magic]] practiced by the races of Faerûn. Over millennia, the Ba'etith codified this knowledge in the ''Golden Skins of the World Serpent'', later called the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]''.

==Abilities==
The abilities of the batrachi are unknown, but Bazim-Gorag claimed that, as a batrachi lord, he was "far more powerful than any common fiend".

==Creations of the Batrachi==
The batrachi created or were the ancestors of a number of amphibious, piscine, and shapeshifting races and creatures, including [[bullywug]]s, [[doppelganger]]s, [[kopru]], [[kuo-toa]], [[locathah]], [[siv]]s, and [[tako]].

==Notable Batrachi==
* The High One [[Zhoukoudien]]
* [[Bazim-Gorag]], the Firebringer
