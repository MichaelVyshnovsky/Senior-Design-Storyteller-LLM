'''Broken ones''', also known as '''animal men''', were a variety of [[humanoid]]s whose bodies had been spliced with [[animal]]s through means of scientific or [[magic]]al experiments gone wrong, a powerful [[curse]], and, on rare occasions, by the [[Dark Powers]] of the [[Domains of Dread]].

==Description==
These creatures more or less looked [[human]], but their bodies were warped and twisted. The non-human parts of their bodies were clearly visible to any who could see them. By their very nature, the features of a broken one's body varied by individual, however, they never displayed traits of intelligent nonhuman races. For example, those merged with a [[scorpion]] might have a chitinous shell or a [[poison]]ous stinger, while those merged with a rat might have a long [[whip]]-like tail and wiry whiskers.

==Personality==
The habits of broken ones were often dictated by whatever animal they were spliced with.

==Abilities==

Common traits among broken ones were stamina greater than that of a human and a regenerative ability. Some, known as '''greater broken ones''', were physically superior and healed at an even faster rate.

Broken ones also had varied abilities that were derived from whatever animal they were spliced with, such as [[darkvision]] or keen hearing. The common variety of broken one generally only had one such ability, while greater broken ones exhibited anywhere from one to four unique abilities.

==Combat==
Besides using their animal traits to their advantage, broken ones were known to fight with actual weaponry.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[mercenary]] [[Baerduin Thask]] was known to have transformed his prisoners of war into broken ones.

In [[1367 DR]], just after [[Midsummer|Midsummer Night]], the [[Kolat Towers]] were broken into and several [[spell]] [[scroll]]s were stolen,<ref> including ones that were inscribed with ''[[Duhlark's Animerge]]''. This lead to an insurgence of vagrants in [[Waterdeep]] being turned into broken ones, with them occasionally being found in the sewers below.

In the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of adventurers from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] encountered both common and greater broken ones in the domain of [[Nidala]], that had all displayed the traits of a scorpion and had been created by some evil wizard that was imprisoned in the dungeon of the darklord's castle. The broken ones were trying to rob a [[wagon]] of animal entrails from a slaughterhouse, fighting a bunch of [[ravenkin]] that were guarding it, before the adventurers intervened.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/To Live and Die in Ravens Bluff|8}}

==Society==
These creatures were typically reclusive, but sought out their own kind. Whenever a society of them was found, it was of a tribal nature and consisted of ten to sixty broken ones of the common variety. There was often a greater broken one in these societies who acted as their leader. These societies did manufacture their own items for the purpose of survival, but they would be of no interest to outsiders.

When possible, broken ones would seek out the ones responsible for their creation and try to destroy them.

===Diet===
The dietary nature of broken ones varied depending upon whatever animal they were spliced with. Some could be strict carnivores, while others were herbivores.

===Homelands===
Broken ones typically dwelled in secluded areas far from human societies, such as in dense woods or rocky wastes.

===Languages===
Broken ones typically spoke whatever languages they knew prior to their transformation, in some limited capacity. Due to their deformities, it was not uncommon for them to speak in a heavily accented or slurred manner. A small number of them were also capable of speaking with whatever animal they had been spliced with.

===Relationships===
Broken ones occasionally attacked human caravans or villages. This was typically out of self-defense, a need for supplies, or simply a desire for vengeance for some wrong. Sometimes evil sages or [[wizard]]s would capture broken ones to study them.

==Notable Broken Ones==
* [[Bloirt Waelarn]] was transformed by an [[archmage]] into what could be considered a broken one.<ref group="note" name="speculation">''[[Prayers from the Faithful]]'' described Bloirt as having been transformed into something "akin to a [[mongrelman]]", rather than simply stating that he had been transformed into one, and the closest thing akin to mongrelfolk in 2{{nd}} edition would be broken ones.{{Speculation}}

==Rumors & Legends==
According to rumors, some broken ones were the results of failed attempts at the [[spell]]s ''[[polymorph]]'', ''[[reincarnate]]'', and [[Resurrection (spell)|''resurrection'']].
