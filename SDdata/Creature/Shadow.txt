Shadows were a type of incorporeal undead.
Shadows were incorporeal and were hard to see in dark areas but were easy to see in brightly lit areas.
Shadows hated life and light. Against living creatures, shadows were very aggressive and quick to attack, they were known to hesitate briefly when confronted with someone wearing a silkstone. Their favored victims were innocent creatures, who lived morally good lives.
Their touch sapped the strength of living creatures.
