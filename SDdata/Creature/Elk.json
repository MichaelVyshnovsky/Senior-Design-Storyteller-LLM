They were favored by Uthgar and the sleeping god Ulutiu.\nElk had a good sense of smell and were adept at hiding.\nElk would flee from most predators or hunters, but on occasion they would turn and defend themselves against creatures smaller than themselves.\nWhen forced to fight, they would use their hooves.\nElk could be found alone or with herds. in the Ama Basin where they were raised by the Issacortae, the dragonborn kingdom of Relmaur, and in the Howling Mountains.\n* Othovir, a craftsman of Triboar, was famous for creating masterful tack and harnesses from elk hide.\n* In the Ama Basin, the Pazruki were known to cure elk hides into thick, inflexible leather armor.\n* Countess Zaranda Stars bedspread in Morninggold Keep was embroidered with elks and penguins."
