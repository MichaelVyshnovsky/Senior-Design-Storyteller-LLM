        "Description": "Dire animals were tougher, bigger and monstrous versions of ordinary animals. They also appeared to be more feral and violent than other animals. Their appearance was somewhat prehistoric and demonic.\n\nSuch animals were more resistant to certain [[magic]]al [[spell]]s, such as ''[[enrage animals]]''. Some spells also allowed dire animals to be summoned to the aid of the caster.\n\nThe animal forms of many [[lycanthropes]] were of the ''dire'' version, such as [[werebadger]]s, [[wererat]]s, and even [[weremole]]s.<ref group=\"note\">Though ''Demihuman Deities'' does not use the \"dire\" appellation for the weremole, only calling it a \"giant mole\", ''Shining South'' and ''Serpent Kingdoms'' call the members of the [[Blood Screamers]] \"dire weremoles\", suggesting that the giant mole is a dire mole. Neither giant moles nor dire moles have been presented outside the weremole, however."
