        "mainbody": "The hammer pony was a breed of war pony that originated from the gold dwarf realm of the Great Rift in the Shining South. They were bred for their strength and endurance in battle and were just as comfortable underground, even in the Underdark, or above on Torils surface.\nThey were not well known beyond the Shaar and were not often sold beyond the dwarven trading town, Hammer and Anvil. While they were sold for 400 gp within the settlement, they could go for as much as 1200 gold pieces in a shop outside the Shaar.\nLarge and muscular in appearance, for a pony that is, they were able to support the full weight of a dwarf armored in plate mail. While they ranged in color from a light brown to black, they always had blonde manes and feathering around their ankles.\nAlthough they would eat grass, as all horses would, their favorite food was fungus."
