        "Description": "A flumph's body was shaped like a flat saucer with a diameter of {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}}, slightly larger than a [[human]] from shoulder to shoulder, and between {{SIrange|3|4|in|c|long=yes}} thick at their center, about as thick as a human arm. The thickness tapered to about {{SI|1|in|c|long=yes}} at the edge of the saucer. Their bodies were hollow, with a small circular hole at the center of their topside. They had a pair of {{SIAdj|6|in|c|adj=long}} eyestalks on either side of the central hole, as well as numerous tentacles and small spikes that grew from the underside.\n\nFlumphs floated about {{SIrange|4|6|in|c|long=yes}} above the ground{{Cite dragon/246/The Ecology of the Flumph|78}} and moved by using air jets as propulsion. The air circulated through the flumph's body by entering in the central upper cavity and exiting from small holes in its underside and from apertures along the rim of its body. In fact, they were named after the characteristic whistling sound made by these jets, which could only be heard in quiet areas and produced a gentle breeze. Their more peripheral tentacles were very dextrous and were capable of manipulating small objects.\n\nCommon flumphs were white, while monastic flumphs were pale yellow or green, with tentacles ending in darker shades. Flumphs also glowed faintly in different colors depending on their mood.",
        "Personality": "Flumphs were wise and possessed advanced knowledge of philosophy and other subjects. They fed on [[psionic]] energy and were therefore more likely to be found near strong sources, such as [[aboleth]], [[Gith (race)|gith]], and [[mind flayer]] settlements. However, due to their strong telepathic nature, flumphs were very sensitive to [[evil]] thoughts and felt the need to share them as quickly as possible with any [[good]]-aligned creatures they found, in order to wash these thoughts away.\n\n{{Border box float\n| theme        = \n| float        = right\n| contentalign = center\n| width        = 180px\n| styles       = \n| content      = <center><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"><caption style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif; font-size:110%; font-weight:bold\">Flumph Glow Colors</caption>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:80px; border-right:1px solid #A0522D\">Color</th>\n<th style=\"width:90px\">Emotion</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; border-right:1px solid #A0522D; background:#FFC0CB\">Pink</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; \">Amusement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; border-right:1px solid #A0522D; color:white; background:#0000FF\">Blue</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; \">Sadness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; border-right:1px solid #A0522D; background:#00FF00\">Green</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; \">Curiosity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; border-right:1px solid #A0522D; color:white; background:#FF0000\">Red</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center; \">Anger</td>\n</tr>\n</table></center>\n}}\nIt was also common for flumphs exposed to evil thoughts to spontaneously glow red in anger. This reaction was considered a sign to adventurers that evil monsters lurked nearby.",
        "Combat": "Normally, a flumph's reaction when facing an evil creature was to flee. However, flumphs' tendrils were acidic and could be used as defensive weapons if necessary. They also had the ability to shoot a sticky, foul-smelling fluid whose odor lasted for several hours and was potent enough to sicken nearby creatures as well. The fluid could be removed from a victim by spending at least an hour bathing in [[water]], alcohol, or vinegar.\n\nAs a result of its anatomy and flight mechanics, a flumph became almost completely helpless if turned upside down. They could right themselves up only with great effort.\n\nThey were capable of overhearing any [[Telepathy|telepathic]] conversation held within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, but were immune to attempts at reading their thoughts or their emotions against their will.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Flumphs were largely ignored by mind flayers, who had no interest in them. For that reason, it was relatively common to find cloisters of flumphs near mind flayer settlements. On the other hand, [[githyanki]] abhorred flumphs violently, and attacked them on sight.\n\nFlumph flesh was considered unpalatable to most races, but they were occasionally hunted for food by [[ogre]]s and [[goblinoid]]s."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "Some flumph internal organs could be harvested for practical applications. Their brains, when powdered, could be used in the crafting of ''[[potion of levitation|potions of levitation]]'', with a yield of three potions per brain. The inner layers of their tentacles could also be harvested to make ''[[oil of acid resistance]]'', with every twenty tentacles yielding one serving of oil.\n\nThe glands that produced their defensive foul-smelling fluid could be used as a [[material component]] for the ''[[stinking cloud]]'' spell. However, the characteristic smell produced by a spell cast using that component was likely to attract the attention of every flumph within a {{SIAdj|1|mi|k}} radius."
        },
        "History": "The origin of the flumphs was ultimately a mystery. It was speculated that flumphs were genetically related to [[grell]]s or [[belabra]]s, due to some physiological similarities such as their hovering and the presence of tentacles. Given the probable genetic ties to the grells, most sages agreed that flumphs originated in a different world and traveled as clandestine passengers in grell [[spelljammer]] ships.{{Cite dragon/246/The Ecology of the Flumph|81}}\n\n[[File:Seadeeps.jpg|thumb|300px|''A cloister of flumphs curiously examining a visitor to Undermountain.'']]\nDuring the late [[1480 DR|1480s DR]], flumphs were greatly disturbed by the [[demon]]ic madness that permeated the [[Underdark]]. Some offered assistance to anyone who opposed the [[derro]] cultists under [[Gracklstugh]], while a cloister of flumphs from the [[Wormwrithings]] maintained that kindness was the only appropriate response during those evil times.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} a cloister of flumphs inhabited the [[Seadeeps]] level of [[Undermountain]], feeding off the psionic energy of the nearby illithid and githyanki settlements.",
        "Notable Flumphs": "* [[Laal]], an erudite female flumph who contacted a group of adventurers to seek justice for the murder of her mate, Xol;{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|5, 10}}\n* [[Xol]], an adventurous male flumph who was murdered by the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] in an expedition to the [[sewers of Mulmaster]]."
