The body of a fire toad measured  in length and had red leathery skin covered in rough, purple warts.
In contrast to many species of toad, fire toads displayed a sense of hydrophobia and sought to avoid being in contact with liquid whenever possible. Throwing liquid at a fire toad was known to make it retreat, but also hostile.

Instead of slowly dying out, the fire toads adapted to eating beetles and other insect species in their habitat.
Due to their hydrophobia, fire toads typically inhabited dry regions with a warm to temperate climate.
In Faer√ªn, these creatures could be found in the Fire Marshes of High Moor and underneath the Giantspire Mountains.
In the Hordelands they inhabited Semphar, the Raurin desert, and the Quoya Desert. They also inhabited tropical and subtropical deserts in neighboring Kara-Tur.
