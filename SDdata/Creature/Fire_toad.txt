'''Fire toads''' were a unique species of [[toad]].

==Description==
The body of a fire toad measured {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} in length and had red leathery skin covered in rough, purple warts.

==Behavior==
In contrast to many species of toad, fire toads displayed a sense of hydrophobia and sought to avoid being in contact with liquid whenever possible. Throwing liquid at a fire toad was known to make it retreat, but also hostile.

They rarely attacked other creatures unless provoked, threatened, or defending their lair.

==Abilities==
Fire toads were capable of spitting small [[fireball]]s from their mouths out to a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. These fireballs typically had a blast radius of around {{SI|5|ft}}.

==Combat==
Instead of attacking with their tongue like other species of toad, a fire toad relied solely on its unique ability to spit out fireballs.

==History==
Some time thousands of years prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the fire toads that inhabited areas beneath the [[Giantspire Mountains]] were deprived of the [[ankheg]] larvae they regularly consumed by an explosion in their habitat's [[umber hulk]] population. Instead of slowly dying out, the fire toads adapted to eating [[beetle]]s and other insect species in their habitat.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Due to their hydrophobia, fire toads typically inhabited dry regions with a warm to temperate climate.

In [[Faer√ªn]], these creatures could be found in the [[Fire Marsh]]es of [[High Moor]] and underneath the Giantspire Mountains.

In the [[Hordelands]] they inhabited [[Semphar]], the [[Raurin desert]], and the [[Quoya Desert]]. They also inhabited tropical and subtropical deserts in neighboring [[Kara-Tur]].

Beyond [[Toril]], fire toads could be found in tropical and subtropical deserts on the planet [[Oerth]].

===Relationships===
Some [[efreeti]] were known to domesticate fire toads.
===Usages===
The blood of a fire toad could be mixed with the blood of a [[red dragon]] in a broth to [[item enchantment|enchant]] its [[dragon's tooth|tooth]].
