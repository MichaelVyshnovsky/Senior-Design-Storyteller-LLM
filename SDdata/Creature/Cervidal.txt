Cervidals were the most common kind of guardinal. They lived in the Blessed Fields of Elysium and the House of Nature.
Cervidals were goat-like celestials that looked similar to satyrs, but were more noble in appearance. They had horns, hooves in place of feet, and bony plating on the backs of their hands. Cervidals were typically slim but muscular in build and were covered by short, reddish-brown or dark red fur.
Cervidal horns had the interesting abilities of being able to negate poison and disease, dispel illusions, and dismiss a summoned or conjured extraplanar creature by touch.
Cervidals were peaceful by nature, but when they did get involved in a fight, they finished it. In a straight fight, cervidals were more than a match for rank-and-file demons and devils.
Manath, the Horned Duke, was the leader of the cervidals and their representative in the Five Companions. Cervidals, like other guardinals, were known to serve the goddess Mystra as well.
