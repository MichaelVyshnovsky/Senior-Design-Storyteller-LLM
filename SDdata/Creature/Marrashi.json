In return for their service, a marrashi demanded treasure or the freedom to spread contagion.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Monstrous Compendium Pages}}",
        "Description": "Marrash possessed the body of a man with the wings and feet of a large bird. Their heads appeared like those of jackals. They spoke with a screeching voice.",
        "Combat": "Marrash were deadly aerial combatants, capable of powerful bow attacks using their clawed feet. Their arrows were usually barbed or diseased. Victims effected by this disease usually perished.\n\nTo spread their populations, marrash used special diseased ''taklif'' arrows that appeared to infect a target with the same deadly disease. Victims of these arrows died within one day if left untreated. The growing marrashi consumed the soul of the victim until they died. If buried, the corpse would slowly be transformed into a new marrashi within one week. The new marrashi often retained memories from the victim.",
        "Habitat/Society": "The [[outer plane]]s served as the natural home of these creatures, though they could be summoned anywhere by sha'irs and genies.\n\nOnce summoned, a marrashi would attempt to increase their numbers in secrecy with the hopes that their offspring would avenge their servitude.\n\nA large body of marrash was employed by the [[yak folk]] of the [[World Pillar Mountains]] to help maintain control and order throughout their [[Yikarian Empire|empire]].{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}",
        "Ecology": "These creatures had little effect on ecology unless their disease spread to populated areas. Their eternal war with the [[asuras]] sometimes spread between planes.",
        "History": "Around {{Yearlink|-30400}}, [[gnoll]] [[shaman]]s of [[Yeenoghu]] [[Summon monster|summoned]] marrash from the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]] to spread a plague on the avian race of [[aearee]]. This came to be called the [[Wasting Plague]]."
