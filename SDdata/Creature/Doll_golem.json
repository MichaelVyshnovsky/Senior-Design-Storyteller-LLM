        "mainbody": "Doll golems were a type of construct made from a singular childs toy, most often a doll or stuffed animal. They were often created in order to either protect children or infiltrate their homes and attack them,\nThese constructs were mindless, lacking any high form of intelligence.\nWhen doll golems bit a victim there was a chance that they would induce an effect akin to the spell Tashas hideous laughter, compelling their victim to continually laugh until they either died from an inability to breath or were treated with dispel magic. Like most golems the were largely impervious to magical attacks, though fire-based spells could partially harm them. The warp wood spell imparted an effect similar to slow upon them. And mending could largely heal any damage that was done to them.\nZhent Doll Golem By the late 14 century DR the Zhentarim were occasionally making doll golems that had the unique ability to identify on sight if someone was a true worshiper of either Bane or Cyric. This unique trait allowed Zhents to identify and eliminate double agents and non-worshipers in their midsts. They were also distinct from other doll golems in that they had an average level of intellect and aligned towards evil.\n* Audrey, a Zhent doll golem that was not evil due to being partially defective.\n* Cuddle, a stuffed bear doll golem that belonged to Callie of Ravens Bluff.\n* Lady Katharine, a doll golem that was created by the air elementalist Mortimer Lightfoot to be a life-sized duplicate of Lady Katharine Blacktree.\nDoll golems generally took around two months to construct.\nBeyond Toril these golems could be found in the Domains of Dread. There the first record instances of them were in a domain called Sanguinia. It was seen in the hands of a traveling priest, whose name was long forgotten. According to legends he had created the doll golem to protect his wife and daughter as they traveled through the land."
