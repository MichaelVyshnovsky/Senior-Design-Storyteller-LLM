Shaggun were a wild species of bovine in northwest Faer√ªn,
In appearance, the bovines that shaggun most closely resembled were bison.
These wild cattle were generally more aggressive than the standard domestic breeds of cattle in the North.
Huge herds of these creatures roamed the central plains and hills of the North, often competing with domestic cattle herds for pasturage.
Shaggun saw domestication in the hamlet of Longsaddle and in the Talmost Lands, with crofters under the Talmost clans employ watching over their scattered herds.
Beyond domestication, shaggun were hunted by the Uthgardt for food and fought as a test of a barbarians courage.
