'''Shaggun''' were a wild species of bovine in [[northwest Faerûn]],{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5}}

==Description==
In appearance, the bovines that shaggun most closely resembled were [[bison]].

==Behavior==
These wild cattle were generally more aggressive than the standard domestic breeds of cattle in the North.

==Ecology==
Huge herds of these creatures roamed the central plains and hills of the North, often competing with domestic cattle herds for pasturage.
===Relationships===
Shaggun saw domestication in the hamlet of [[Longsaddle]] and in the [[Talmost Lands]], with crofters under the [[Talmost]] clan's employ watching over their scattered herds.

Beyond domestication, shaggun were hunted by the [[Uthgardt]] for food and fought as a test of a [[barbarian]]'s courage.
