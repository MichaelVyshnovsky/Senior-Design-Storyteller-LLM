        "mainbody": "A '''selkie''', sometimes referred to as a (sort of) '''sealwere''', was a very rare creature, capable of taking the form of a [[seal]]-like being or of a [[humanoid]].",
        "Description": "[[File:Selkies.png|thumb|273px|''Three selkies in various states of transformation.'']]\nSelkies were intelligent seal-like beings that, instead of flippers, had webbed hands and feet. Their eyes were either light blue or bright green, like that of [[emerald]]s. Other than that, they were indistinguishable from normal seals. These [[shapechanger]]s were able to assume a [[human]] form, once per month, for around a week. Their human form could vary, but generally they had tanned skin with black or gray hair.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures enjoyed seafood and acted in a peculiar manner, sometimes leading to their unwanted detection. Oddly, they also enjoyed [[wine]].\n\nCompared to some aquatic lifeforms, selkies were passionately concerned about the welfare and health of their environment. They were more easily offended than others by surface dwellers and foreigners abusing their homeland's sea life.",
        "Abilities": "Their humanoid forms couldn't be dispelled, as they were [[antherion]]s, but ''[[true seeing]]'' [[spell]]s, or a creature with ''[[truesight]]'', could see through the selkies' assumed form.\n\nThe leaders of selkie communities typically knew the spells ''[[augury]]'', ''[[control weather]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', and ''[[weather summoning]]''. They generally only used weather related spells when they were in dire need of exacting revenge. Beyond leaders, some more magically inclined selkies were known to take up the role of a [[hedge wizard]].",
        "Combat": "Selkies usually fought unarmed, as weapons made swimming difficult, slowing them greatly. They also preferred to run from combat instead of fighting, utilizing their strong webbed arms and legs to move away quickly. Thus, they used their natural weapons, such as their sharp teeth in their natural form, but wielded weapons when taking on humanoid form.{{Cite dragon/250/Heroes of the Sea|34}}",
        "Society": {
            "Lairs": "Selkies enjoyed seeking treasures, usually from sunken ships, which they hoarded in their homely grottoes. As well as grottoes, selkies inhabited underwater caverns in cold water (saltwater or freshwater) environments. Their cavern-like homes had access to air, as young selkies needed to breathe air for the first year or so of their lives.",
            "Homelands": "[[File:Selgaunt sea territory.png|thumb|273px|''A map of the [[Sembian]] Coast, with a marker for a selkie community in the Sea of Fallen Stars.'']]\nSome selkies were known to inhabit the waters of [[Maztica]], the [[Moonshae Isles]], the [[Great Ice Sea]] that surrounded the arctic plains of the [[Hordelands]], [[Serôs]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], and that sea's northwestern fjord [[Dragon Reach]]. In the [[Unapproachable East]], selkies could be found in the lakes of [[Rashemen]].<ref>\n\nBeyond the [[material plane]], selkies were known to inhabit [[Aquallor]], which they referred to as the Endless River, as well as the [[River Oceanus]].<ref>",
            "Religion": "Some selkies were known to worship [[Istishia]]. While others took up the role of [[shaman]] for the deity [[Surminare]].{{Cite dragon/250/Heroes of the Sea|33}}",
            "Relationships": "Selkies often referred to the land above the ocean, where humans had settled, as being the \"Overworld.\" In their human form, they would visit the Overworld and purchase supplies, or even information. They generally, however, had very limited knowledge regarding the surface. Some selkies would spend great deals of time on the surface to try and influence the policies of human communities with regard to their native habitat. Some humans viewed them with a level of fear and superstition, confusing them with [[seawolf|seawolves]].\n\nThose that lived in Serôs were often allies with the neighboring [[aquatic elves]] and  [[merfolk]]. However, for reasons unknown, selkies avoided interacting with neighboring [[locathah]] and [[shalarin]]."

        "History": "Around the mid-1300s [[DR]], [[Black Pearl]] admitted that she'd spent most of her time being raised by selkies, not far from [[Waterdeep]]. She felt more accepted by the selkies than by the [[aquatic elves]].",
        "Notable Selkies": "* [[Flirin]], a selkie restaurateur in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].",
        "Trivia": "* Those who specialized in sea-based [[magic]] could [[summon]] a selkie with the [[spell]] ''[[monster summoning III]]''.{{Cite dragon/220/Arcane Lore: Sea Magic|72}}\n* The [[Icehunter]] [[shaman]]s of [[Clever Oomio the Gray Seal]] were able to temporarily transform themselves or other worshipers into a selkie form.<ref>"
