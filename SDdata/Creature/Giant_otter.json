        "mainbody": "'''Giant otters''' were a monstrous variety of the mundane aquatic mammal of the [[otter|same name]].",
        "Description": "Giant otters were both fast runners and fast swimmers. Their bodies measured {{SIrange|10|15|ft|long=yes}} in length.",
        "Behavior": "Much like the mundane otter, these creatures were relatively peaceful and playful creatures. Sliding around and playing tag were some of their favorite past times.\n\nGiant otters would not attack others unless threatened, cornered, or their young were threatened. In which case, they fought fiercely. Even their young would fight to defend themselves.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "[[Giant crayfish]] were one of many creatures they were known to prey upon.",
            "Habitats": "Much like their smaller kin, giant otters could be found inhabiting a variety of lakes and rivers. the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]], freshwater bodies in the [[Moonshae Isles]], as well as the rivers and coasts of [[Phlan]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], they could be found in the [[River Oceanus]].<ref>",
            "Relationships": "Giant otters tended to cause some collateral damage as they played. Breaking carts, overturning boats or wagons, and panicking [[horse]]s.\n\nSome [[nereid]]s were known to keep giant otters as pets. And some aquatic [[ranger]]s were known to have them as [[animal companion]]s.",
            "Usages": "Much like the mundane otter, creatures were known to hunt this giant variety for their pelts. Their pelts typically sold for around 1,000 to 4,000 [[gold piece]]s."
        },
        "Trivia": "* Those who specialized in sea-based [[magic]] could [[summon]] a giant otter with the ''[[monster summoning IV]]'' [[spell]].{{Cite dragon/220/Arcane Lore: Sea Magic|72}}\n* A giant otter could also be summoned by means of the ''[[conjure animals]]'' spell.<ref>"
