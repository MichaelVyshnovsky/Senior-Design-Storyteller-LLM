        "Description": "Xvarts were relatively small, standing at around 3 feet (0.9 m). They had blue skin and large yellow eyes. Xvarts often wore simple cloth doublets, preferring greens and blues. Some xvarts had dark patches of hair, often receding.",
        "Personality": "Xvarts were cowardly and easily intimidated.{{Cite_dragon/141/Hey,_Wanna_Be_a_Kobold|42}} Their short, miserable lives led them to despise most creatures and take out their angst on anyone and anything they could; but they particularly enjoyed tormenting larger creatures, in particular [[Goliath|goliaths]] and [[Half-orc|half-orcs]].\n\nHowever they enjoyed somewhat better relationships with [[gnome|gnomes]] and [[halfling|halflings]], having been frequently recruited as spies and minions by evil members of those races.",
        "Combat": "Xvarts were weak as individuals, so they often attacked in large groups. Ambush tactics were the xvarts preferred form of attack. They would often attack sleeping opponents if given the opportunity. Xvart raiding parties sometimes took prisoners to torture or hold for ransom.\n\nCommonly used xvart weapons were [[short sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s and [[net]]s. Xvart \"net casters\" would try and restrain larger opponents, allowing the blade wielding xvarts to swarm their opponent.\n\nSome xvarts were able to tap into a type of shadow magic which they used in combat as well as to protect their homes.{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|27}} or were [[witch doctor]]s.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Xvarts had no known formal religion, but the reference to xvart tribal shamans does indicate that they may have had some kind of spiritual beliefs.",
            "Interracial Relations": "Xvarts were naturally drawn to shadow creatures. They were often used by [[evil]] gnomes or [[halfling]]s as minions.\n\nXvarts feared [[human]]s and would only attack groups of humans if they had a considerable numeric advantage.\n\nXvarts considered themselves above [[kobold]]s in a racial hierarchy and would bully kobolds whenever possible.\n\nXvarts had a hatred of large creatures like [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s. They particularly loathed [[goliath]]s and [[half-orc]]s.{{Cite dungeon/217/Rats in the Undercellar|13}}"
        },
        "History": "Xvarts were once [[gnome]]s. They were captured by [[fomorian]]s and enslaved in the [[Shadowdark]]. Over many generations the creatures were warped by fell [[magic]] and slowly began to adapt to their surroundings.\n\nAs part of a bargain with a cabal of [[hag]]s, a number of xvarts escaped the [[Shadowdark]] and slipped into the [[Shadowfell]]. This led to these xvarts becoming even more disfigured and unlike their gnome ancestors.\n\nEventually many of the creatures found their way back into [[Toril]] and into the [[Feywild]], though some are still slaves to the [[fomorian|fomorians]].\n\nAround [[1479 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The date stated here was determined by this process; The [[Dungeon magazine 217|Rats in the Undercellar]] adventure describes xvarts to be living beneath [[Baldur's Gate]]. The adventure says to refer to [[Murder in Baldur's Gate]] for more information on the adventure's setting. The Murder in Baldur's Gate adventure is set after [[1479 DR]]. a band of xvarts were brought to the sewers beneath [[Baldur's Gate]] from the [[Feywild]] by the gnome illusionist [[Rothryn Toth]] in order to pillage the city on his behalf. \nA population of xvarts had established a significant presence in a region of the [[Sword Coast]] near-south of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the decades after the [[Time of Troubles]]. There they established a village in the mountains west of [[Nashkel]] and carried out raids on local farmers, taking a particular interest in their cattle.  They also allied themselves with a nearby population of [[gnoll]]s and took up residence in a group of caves close to a fortress of theirs, providing troops to aid in its defense.",
        "Pawns of Raxivort?": "In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Volothamp Geddarm]] presented an alternative interpretation of Xvarts in his book ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]''.\n\nIn this tome, Volo asserted that xvarts are not a natural race, but rather magical clones of the lesser demon prince [[Raxivort]] created through the power of the [[Infinity Spindle]]. According to Volo's research, Raxivort had gained his powers through the artifact, but at the cost of angering his former master, [[Graz'zt]]. The vengeful demon prince had responded by letting it be known that Raxivort was the new bearer of the Infinity Spindle, thus making him a target for all entities that might desire the Spindle's power. Ever since then, Raxivort has lived a life of constant hiding and migration, creating colonies of xvarts to obfuscate attempts to divine his location.\n\nIt bears mentioning that Volo is known for his creative interpretations and willingness to take dramatic license, which makes this interpretation's accuracy a matter of some debate."
