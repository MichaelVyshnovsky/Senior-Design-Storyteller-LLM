'''Constrictor snakes''' were large [[snake]]s found throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. Common constrictor snake species encountered were '''anacondas''', '''boas''' and '''reticulated pythons'''. They were one of the species counted as [[:Category:Serpents|serpents]].<ref>

==Description==
Constrictor snakes had a similar appearance to a regular snake but their proportions were much larger. They had large scales, sharp fangs that curved inwards and strong muscles. Large constrictor snakes could reach lengths of up to {{SI|30|ft}}.{{Cite dragon/115/Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth|42}}

==Combat==
Constrictor snakes were ambush predators. They either dropped onto a target from above or slowly approached their prey while they were sleeping. They bit into their prey with their sharp fangs, anchoring them while they used their powerful muscles to constrict their prey, causing slow suffocation.

==Abilities==
Some constrictor snakes possessed an innate magical ability to charm a target, causing temporary paralyzation.

==Species==
* '''Boa constrictors''' were a species noted for having patterns of blotches on their scales that acted as camouflage.
* [[Dung snake]], an aquatic species that carried a strong odour.
* [[Giant constrictor snake]]
* [[Water constrictor]], an aquatic species that inhabited that waters around [[Icewind Dale]].
* [[White-furred snake]], a species that was native to cold region.
* [[Whipsnake]]

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Constrictor snakes were obligate carnivores. A constrictor snake was large enough to kill and consume a small to medium-sized [[humanoid]]. Their jaws have evolved to allow them to eat large prey. The jaw became unhinged from their skull, and the lower jaw had a special elastic ligament which allowed it to spread into two halves.
===Habitats===
Constrictor snakes were found in warm forests and jungles. They were known to live within [[Cormanthor]] and the jungles of [[Chult]].

===Usages===
The skin of a constrictor snake was a sought after item in many markets. A good quality skin could cost a buyer up to 100 [[gp]].
