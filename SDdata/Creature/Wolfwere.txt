A '''wolfwere''' was an [[antherion]] whose natural form was a [[wolf]] and could transform into a [[humanoid]] or wolf-humanoid hybrid.

{{quote|''Wolfweres. When [[werewolves]] and wolves mate, their offspring are more wolf than man. The creatures are more intelligent than normal wolves and can change shape to look like werewolves whenever they want. They're incredibly powerful and are ferocious killers. Once they're stirred up, they fight to the death-as you now know from experience.''|[[Andoralson]], [[Druid]] of the [[Moonsea]]}}

==Description==
Wolfweres were completely different to werewolves, which they were often confused with, as they could both assume lupine, humanoid, and hybrid forms. However, werewolves were [[lycanthrope]]s, and in some cases, could pass on their condition via an infectious bite. Wolfweres, however, like other antherions, could only pass on their condition genetically.

==Behavior==
These exceptionally smart creatures were hateful, being the bane of [[human]]s and humanoids. They relished brutally slaying them, most often by surprise. Wolfweres could shapechange into very charismatic humanoids (and particularly chose the opposite sex of their victims), so that they could lure others into ambushes. These antherions much preferred their native form, that of a large wolf, which was essentially a [[dire wolf]].

As antherions, they hated lycanthropes, as much as lycanthropes hated them.

Many of these creatures would carry string instruments, such as [[lute]]s, often seducing creatures and causing lethargy. Here the wolfweres' targets would become ''[[slow]]ed'' and unable to stop the effect.

==Combat==
When wolfweres struck, they reverted to their hybrid forms, in which they could utilize the powers of both humanoids and wolves. In this form, they would attack their prey with both a vicious bite and with weapons. Wolfweres often used [[axe]]s or [[sword]]s. If forced to fight in human form, wolfweres might try to escape to shapechange into their hybrid form.

These antherions could only be struck by [[cold iron]] or [[magic]]al [[weapon]]s. They were sickened by [[belladonna]], and chose to avoid it whenever possible.

==Society==
Wolfweres were almost always lone hunters, and it was very rare to find them in groups of more than three. However, during mating times, multiple wolfweres could attack at once.
===Homelands===
Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], wolfweres could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].
===Relationships===
Despite not often being found with other wolfweres, they often took the company of [[evil]] wolf creatures, such as [[worgs]]. The wolfweres would influence these creatures, as well as ordinary wolves, to take an evil path.

The werefox goddess [[Eshebala]] was known to favor wolfweres because of their hatred of werewolves, though whether or not the wolfweres worshiped her in return was unknown.<ref>
