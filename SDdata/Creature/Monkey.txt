Monkeys, or kera in the Lidahan script, were a collective term for several small, non-hostile mammals.
* Bearded monkey, species of monkey found in Payit in Maztica.
* Flying monkey
* Howling monkey, species of monkey found in Far Payit in Maztica.
* Lemur, a species of monkey that shared coloration with racoons.
* Monkey spider
While some monkeys were vicious in groups, most would attempt to flee from a fight, climbing a tree to escape any predators.

Monkeys could be found in nearly all of the forested areas of Chult and the jungle regions of Maztica, including Payit and Far Payit.
In the Hordelands, monkeys could be found at the lowest levels of the Katakoro Plateau as well as the Kera Valley in Shou Lung.
In the bazaars of Zakhara, trained monkeys could generally be bought for around 60 to 120 gp. They were particular prized as pets in the city of Huzuz. Similarly, monkeys were trained in Calimshan to perform certain actions or how emotions in response to specific Talis cards.
Some were known to train monkeys to open locks with keys.
*In some elvish societies "Monkey Face" was a slur slung at half-elves.
*The Maztican goddess Nula often appeared in the form of a long-limbed monkey.
