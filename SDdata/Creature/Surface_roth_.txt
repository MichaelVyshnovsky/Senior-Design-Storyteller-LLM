'''Surface rothé''', also known as '''high rothé''' or '''brown rothé''', were a variety of [[rothé]] that lived in surface lands.

==Description==
Surface rothé had shaggy brown fur, cloven hooves, and two curving horns. Their fur was longer and shaggier and their legs were longer compared to their subterranean relatives.

==Combat==
Surface rothé could fight with both their teeth and horns. They were skittish and prone to stampeding, which could be quite dangerous for anyone in their path.

==Ecology==
Rothé were considered an essential animal in [[the North]] due to the meat, hides, and versatile milk they provided. Their dung was often used as a fuel source. They were also known to be frequently herded by [[rashemi]].

===Habitats===
Rothé dwelt on the surface, in both cold and warm climates. They were commonly found in the mountains and glaciers of [[northwest Faerûn]] in the [[Moonsea]]. They occasionally wandered over onto the icy dunes of the [[Anauroch]].

The further south the rothé dwelt, the lighter the color and density of their fur. They were found throughout the [[Western Heartlands]] and [[south Faerûn]]. and were herded in the [[Shaar]] and [[Rashemen]].
