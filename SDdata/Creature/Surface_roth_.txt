Surface rothé, also known as high rothé or brown rothé, were a variety of rothé that lived in surface lands.
Surface rothé had shaggy brown fur, cloven hooves, and two curving horns. Their fur was longer and shaggier and their legs were longer compared to their subterranean relatives.
Surface rothé could fight with both their teeth and horns. They were skittish and prone to stampeding, which could be quite dangerous for anyone in their path.
Rothé were considered an essential animal in the North due to the meat, hides, and versatile milk they provided. Their dung was often used as a fuel source. They were also known to be frequently herded by rashemi.
Rothé dwelt on the surface, in both cold and warm climates. They were commonly found in the mountains and glaciers of northwest Faerûn in the Moonsea. They occasionally wandered over onto the icy dunes of the Anauroch.
The further south the rothé dwelt, the lighter the color and density of their fur. They were found throughout the Western Heartlands and south Faerûn. and were herded in the Shaar and Rashemen.
