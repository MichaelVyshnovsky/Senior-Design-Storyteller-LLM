        "mainbody": "The mantimera was a species derived from crossbreeding a manticore with a chimera. Because of this unique breeding, all mantimeras were sterile.\nMantimeras essentially had the body components of their two parent species. They had the hindquarters of a goat, the forelegs of a lion and large, bat-like wings of a manticore but also possessed three heads like a chimera. One head was that of a bestial humanoid, similar to a manticore, while the other two were those of a horned goat and a chromatic dragon. Their tails were flared and barbed at the end like a wyvern, with rows of spikes going up the spine.\nLike the chimera, mantimeras preferred to surprise their opponents in combat. They could rake with their claws and whip with or launch spikes from their tail. They also possessed a breath attack from their dragon head, the color of which determined the breath type."
