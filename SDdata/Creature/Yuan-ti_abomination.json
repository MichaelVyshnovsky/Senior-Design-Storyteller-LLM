        "mainbody": "Yuan-ti abominations were monstrous serpent-like creatures possessed of both great intelligence and powerful magic. They formed the highest major caste of yuan-ti society.\nYuan-ti abominations resembled massive snakes, some  long and weighing approximately , with scale-covered humanoid arms. Their scale patterns were variable according to tribe, but they had the wedge-shaped heads distinctive of venomous snakes.\nAbominations often used scimitars in melee combat. They also attacked using their fangs, delivering a powerful poison. Abominations did not wear armor, for their scales were more than enough to protect them.\nAbominations possessed various innate psionic abilities that made them deadly warriors they could induce a severe aversion to snakes in any creature within  of them, forcing that creature to stay at least  from any snake they saw they could produce acid to coat their scales, or change the color of their scales to match their surroundings they could detect poison at will and they could shapechange into the form of a viper of variable size.\nYuan-ti abominations could use the spell-like abilities animal trance and entangle at will deeper darkness, neutralize poison, and suggestion thrice each day and fear and baleful polymorph (into a snake only) once each day. Some sources added that they could use snake charm and sticks to snakes once each day as well, or animal friendship on snakes at will.\nYuan-ti abominations in their own form were dangerously venomous and capable of both swimming and climbing easily.\nUnless one of the much rarer and more powerful yuan-ti anathemas was present, yuan-ti abominations were the leaders and masterminds of the yuan-ti, as well as the highest-ranking priests in each tribes temple.\nAbominations considered humans repugnant and barely tolerated yuan-ti pureblood. Like all yuan-ti, abominations found the body odor of humans repulsive.\nAbominations were obligate carnivores and preferred eating warm-blooded creatures. Their favorite meal were birds and humans."
