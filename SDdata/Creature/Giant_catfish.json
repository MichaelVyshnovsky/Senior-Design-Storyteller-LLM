        "mainbody": "'''Giant catfish''' were naturally occurring mutations of the ordinary [[catfish]].\n\n{{quote|''Nogah's finely scaled, webbed hands pulled sharply on the reins that stretched down into the murk. Some of the cords were attached to the whisker-like barbels of the beast pulling the sea coach: a catfish the size of a small whale.''}}",
        "Description": "These giant fish were often of chalky-white coloration or grayish brown. Their sizes usually varied from {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} for the white-colored breed to {{SI|24|ft|long=yes}} for the brown.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were known to display aggressive behavior and thus they would often and attempt to swallow any creature that was suitably small enough despite their usual diet. Because of this, they often posed a threat to races of short statue, such as [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s.",
        "Biology": "Like their normal-sized cousins, giant catfish had many spiny, long tentacle-like feelers on each side of their mouths. Some referred to these as \"whiskers.\" The whiskers on giant catfish secreted a strong toxin [[poison]].",
        "Combat": "When hunting or provoked into combat, a catfish immediately went for a bite or attempted to swallow it whole if possible. They sometimes used their feelers as weapons by whipping their heads back and forth or side to side.",
        "History": "Giant catfish were sometimes used for towing boats in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n\nAround [[1396 DR]], giant catfish were often tamed by the [[kuo-toa]] of the Sea of Fallen Stars, as evidenced by the gargantuan nautilus shell carriage pulled by giant catfish that belonged to [[Nogah]], the senior whip of [[Blibdoolpoolp]].",
        "Sub-Species": {
            "Stalking catfish": "An underground type of giant catfish that lived in the tunnels of the [[Underdark]]. In instances when this species made its way to the surface, they became top predators of the surrounding area.{{Cite dragon/267/Dragon's Bestiary: Designing Dungeon Monsters}}"
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Giant catfish were resilient omnivores whose diet was primarily bottom-feeding scavenging. Because of these dietary habits, giant catfish needed a large area in order to find enough food to survive.",
            "Habitats": "Giant catfish were commonly found living in large rivers, or lakes that such rivers fed into, in climates that ranged from tropical to temperate. They typically dwelled within the cool dark muck of such aquatic environments.\n\nIn [[Faerûn]] they were particularly known to be encountered in the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]], the [[River Ashaba]] of [[Cormanthor]], and [[Dragon Reach]].\n\nBeyond Faerûn, giant catfish could be found in temperate, tropical, and sub-tropical bodies of freshwater in [[Kara-Tur]]. Such as in the rivers of [[Akari|Akari island]]."
