A keening spirit was a type of ghost, created specifically from the spirit of an evil female elf. Known for its constant weeping and groaning, the creature was sometimes referred to as a "groaning spirit". A drow keening spirit was known as a "kiaranshee", after the drow goddess of the undead, Kiaransalee.
Although a keening spirit shared many of the qualities of a ghost, its most dreaded weapon was its wail or keen. This ability functioned like the wail of the banshee spell.
It was typically shrouded in white light and emanated a chilling presence. Living beings often felt sick and weak in its proximity.
