}}A '''keening spirit''' was a type of [[ghost]], created specifically from the spirit of an evil female [[elf]]. Known for its constant weeping and groaning, the creature was sometimes referred to as a "groaning spirit". A [[drow]] keening spirit was known as a "kiaranshee", after the drow goddess of the undead, [[Kiaransalee]].

==Abilities==
Although a keening spirit shared many of the qualities of a ghost, its most dreaded weapon was its wail or keen. This ability functioned like the ''[[wail of the banshee]]'' spell.

It was typically shrouded in white light and emanated a chilling presence. Living beings often felt sick and weak in its proximity.

==Notable Spirits==
* [[Cabrath Nelinderra]]: A powerful kiaranshee, Cabrath was an undead priestess of Kiaransalee in ghostly form that served as the head priestess in the [[Acropolis of Thanatos]].
