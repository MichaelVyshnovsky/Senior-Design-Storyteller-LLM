        "Description": "Like other quori, tsucoras were the embodiments of dreams. They had elongated, serpentine bodies, the headless torsos of which were covered with a multitude of eyes and grasping limbs. Tsucoras had two massive arms ending in vicious-looking pincers, while their tails ended in a sharp stinger.",
        "Abilities": "Master manipulators, tsucora quori excelled at playing on the fears and doubts of mortals. They could possess the bodies of [[humanoid]]s, taking control of a host body while keeping their victim aware yet powerless to act.",
        "Personality": "Tsucora quori were natural schemers who were constantly making cruel and elaborate plans to increase their own station among the quori. They enjoyed power as a means to itself. When not serving the greater purpose of the quori, tsucoras spent their time hunting the dream-spirits of sleeping mortals.",
        "Combat": "Partial to attacking their enemies with their pincers and stinger, tsucoras also possessed some minor [[psionics|psionic]] ability, allowing them to innately cast [[spell]]s like ''[[fear]]'' and ''[[charm person]]''.",
        "History": "In the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, a tsucora quori arrived on [[Toril]] as one of many captive creatures within the crashed [[nautiloid]] ''[[Id Ascendant]]''.<ref>"
