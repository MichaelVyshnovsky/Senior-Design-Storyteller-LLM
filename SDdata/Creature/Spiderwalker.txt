'''Spiderwalkers''' were a type of [[construct]] created by practitioners of [[hishna]] from the bodies of dried [[tarantula]]s.

==Behavior==
Spiderwalkers could be given very specific instructions, but only by those who knew their [[command word]]. They could be directed to strike at a certain individual, or to fight as many of a certain type as they could encounter.

==Abilities==
These constructs had a [[poison]]ous bite. They were capable of springing up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} into the air and could survive falls of any height, landing with great accuracy.

Spiderwalkers could only be activated at night time and when the first rays of [[the sun]] arose they would cease to function, even if the sun was concealed by clouds or the spiderwalker was indoors or underground.
