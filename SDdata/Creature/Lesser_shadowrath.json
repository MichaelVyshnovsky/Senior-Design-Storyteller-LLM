        "Description": "These creatures resembled blackened [[skeleton]]s whose eyes glowed with crimson energy.",
        "Personality": "Lesser shadowraths retained their intelligence, but were under the complete control of whoever wore the ''Crown of Horns'' if they were within {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "Any magical or [[psionic]] abilities acquired by a lesser shadowrath during their life were lost upon their transformation. The touch of a lesser shadowrath was similar to the ''[[chill touch]]'' [[spell]], causing physical harm and temporarily draining a bit of the target's strength. Death would result if the target was completely drained of their strength.\n\nThese creatures were immune to normal and [[silver]] weapons.",
        "Society": "If uncontrolled, a lesser shadowrath sought to destroy spellcasters or followers of [[Mystra]].",
        "History": "Lesser shadowraths were created by the \"ray of undeath\" power of the ''Crown of Horns''. The ray of undeath destroyed all non-magical equipment carried by the individual when they were struck. Any [[magic item]]s carried by the individual were simply dropped to the ground and abandoned or collected for the ''Crown'' bearer."
