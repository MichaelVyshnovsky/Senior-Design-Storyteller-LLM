        "mainbody": "Chimera-spawn were mutant chimeras, known only in the Stonelands.\nThese mutant chimeras were covered in serpent-scales and had a single central lions head, flanked with two dragon heads.\nPer eyewitnesses, chimera-spawn were recklessly aggressive.\nOne of the chimera-spawns heads breathed fire, and the other one breathed electricity. They were otherwise rather similar to existing chimeras, with only a few differences.\nBesides its twin breath weapons, the chimera-spawns serpentine draconic scales covered its whole body, making it that much tougher and giving it far fewer weak spots. The creature was also slightly hardier than a regular chimera.\nChimerae of the Stonelands sometimes gave birth to chimera-spawn when both sire and mare were chimerae. The resulting mutants lived generally short lives, as they were too aggressive for their own good.\nPer the adventuring wizard Maris Khorna Terrabin, these creatures were found only in the Stonelands. Shed only ever seen one personally, and it was dead after it accidentally collapsed a cave on itself during a fight."
