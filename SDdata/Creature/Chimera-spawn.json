        "mainbody": "'''Chimera-spawn''' were mutant [[chimera]]s, known only in the [[Stonelands]].",
        "Description": "These mutant chimeras were covered in serpent-scales and had a single central lion's head, flanked with two dragon heads.",
        "Personality": "Per eyewitnesses, chimera-spawn were recklessly aggressive.",
        "Abilities": "One of the chimera-spawn's heads breathed fire, and the other one breathed electricity. They were otherwise rather similar to existing chimeras, with only a few differences.",
        "Combat": "Besides its twin breath weapons, the chimera-spawn's serpentine draconic scales covered its whole body, making it that much tougher and giving it far fewer weak spots. The creature was also slightly hardier than a regular chimera.",
        "Ecology": "[[Chimera]]e of the [[Stonelands]] sometimes gave birth to chimera-spawn when both sire and mare were chimerae. The resulting mutants lived generally short lives, as they were too aggressive for their own good.",
        "History": "Per the adventuring [[wizard]] [[Maris Khorna Terrabin]], these creatures were found only in the Stonelands. She'd only ever seen one personally, and it was dead after it accidentally collapsed a cave on itself during a fight."
