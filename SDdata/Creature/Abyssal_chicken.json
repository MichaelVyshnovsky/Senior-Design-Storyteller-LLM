        "Description": "Abyssal chickens were small creatures. They had leather wings but were not capable of sustained flight. Their wings were folded above them, giving them a tear-shaped appearance. They had a large mouth filled with fangs and a long tongue. Abyssal chickens' primary form of locomotion was their two large legs, which ended in feet resembling those of a regular chicken. Each foot had three large claws.",
        "Combat": "Abyssal chickens used their claws and fangs to defend themselves or attack prey. They were fast runners and used their wings to increase their speed.",
