The trees held fleshy sacks on their branches, and when mature they fell to the ground, breaking open.\nAbyssal chickens were hunted and used as a food item. Their flesh had a taste identical to that of a fatty chicken. They were sometimes used as familiars.\n* Earwax, an abyssal chicken that was secretly kept as the animal companion of the barbazu Krikendolt."
