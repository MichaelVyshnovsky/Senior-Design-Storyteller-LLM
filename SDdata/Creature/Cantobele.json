        "mainbody": "'''Cantobeles''' were large, [[feline]]-like creatures.",
        "Description": "Cantobeles looked like a muscular, six-legged feline. They were covered in a double coat of fur, which changed color with the season. A mane ringed their head like that of a [[lion]]s. They had a long thick tail, covered in short fur, which ended in a tuft of long, black hairs. Their eyes resembled that of a [[humans]].",
        "Abilities": "Cantobeles had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[ESP]]'' and ''[[tongues]]'' spells. In addition, they had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of a ''[[misdirection]]'' spell once per day and a ''[[ice storm]]'' twice per day. They were immune to cold-based effects and spells, as well as the worst cold weather. They were very dexterous thanks to their six legs and sharp claws, so much so they were effectively immune to ''[[grease]]'', ''[[fumble]]'' and similar spells.\n\nThey had excellent eyesight and have evolved a second eyelid, which filtered out the glare of sunlight reflecting off of snow. They had infravision with a range of {{SI|100|ft}}.",
        "Combat": "In melee combat, cantobeles were formidable opponents. It used all six of their powerful legs in combat, meaning a target had to deal with set seperate sets of sharp claws. Cantobeles used their tails for balance while fighting, but it was strong enough to strike a target. Cantobeles were ambush predators, hiding until their target was in close range. Cantobele were able to mimic a feminine [[humanoid]] voice, which it used to lure a target closer. It then pounced and knocked its target onto the ground.",
        "Habitat": "Cantobeles were usually encountered in ravines deep within a forest or swamps. They were know to live in the marshlands near [[Impresk Lake]], [[Deepwash]] and [[Rifhake Lake]], as well as along the [[Rebban River]].",
        "Ecology": "Cantobeles had to find a mate every three years. If they were unable to mate, they slowly died over two months. Male cantobeles bore the young, with a typical litter of between four to sixteen cubs. The young remained with their father for up to a year."
