An angel of vengeance was an angel sent to punish those who defied or angered the gods, or to test a mortal who was in danger of falling from the path a deity set for them.
When in battle, these immortals wore plate mail and fought with dual longswords.
These angels showed no mercy. 
Influential clergy members were known to use a powerful ritual to call forth one of these angels to deal out their deitys wrath.
