Stealth and deceit were their chosen methods of attack.\nDespite being large creatures, vishap were surprisingly athletic, being able to run, jump and climb with graceful agility. Vishap scales provided natural camouflage with their surroundings.\nVishap were especially aware of their surroundings and could even detect nearby invisible creatures. These dragons did not have a breath weapon and they could not cast spells, nor did they exude dragon fear.\nMost vishap were an average of  in length, but could grow to over .\nA vishap studied potential opponents for days at a time before engaging in combat. After this time the vishap would approach weak targets to speak and then attack when in range. Victims who flattered a vishap were sometimes spared if they yielded all treasure or served as slaves. Aggressive targets were left alone until they could be ambushed.\nDuring physical combat, a vishap could attack with its teeth, claws and tail. All vishap were immune to enchantment or charm spells and they gained the following spell-like abilities as they aged sleep, invisibility, suggestion, charm monster, undetectable lie.\nVishap chose shallow, open caves that provided them with an excellent view of all angles of approach. One secret escape plan was always allowed for.\nThese creatures were carnivores, though they would consume carrion or even plants if their survival demanded it. Human and demihuman flesh was their favorite kind of meat. Occasionally a group of vishap would work together to enslave an entire village.\nIn Zakharan art, the vishap could signify danger or evil magic.\nSeveral locations in Zakhara were named after the vishap, such as the Vishaps Teeth in the High Desert and the Vishaps Spine mountain range on Sahu.\n*Safsaf"
