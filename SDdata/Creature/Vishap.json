        "mainbody": "'''Vishap''' were flightless [[dragon]]s that lived in [[Zakhara]]. Compared to other dragons they were cowardly, choosing to prey on the weak. Stealth and deceit were their chosen methods of attack.\n\nDespite being large creatures, vishap were surprisingly athletic, being able to run, jump and climb with graceful agility. Vishap scales provided natural camouflage with their surroundings.\n\nVishap were especially aware of their surroundings and could even detect nearby invisible creatures. These dragons did not have a [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] and they could not cast [[spell]]s, nor did they exude dragon fear.",
        "Description": "Most vishap were an average of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} in length, but could grow to over {{SI|174|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "A vishap studied potential opponents for days at a time before engaging in combat. After this time the vishap would approach weak targets to speak and then attack when in range. Victims who flattered a vishap were sometimes spared if they yielded all treasure or served as slaves. Aggressive targets were left alone until they could be ambushed.\n\nDuring physical combat, a vishap could attack with its teeth, claws and tail. All vishap were immune to [[enchantment]] or [[charm]] spells and they gained the following spell-like abilities as they aged: ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[undetectable lie]]''.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "These creatures were carnivores, though they would consume carrion or even plants if their survival demanded it. [[Human]] and [[demihuman]] flesh was their favorite kind of meat. Occasionally a group of vishap would work together to enslave an entire village.",
            "Relationships": "In Zakharan art, the vishap could signify danger or evil magic.{{Cite dragon/242/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magical Allies of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Setting}}\n\nSeveral locations in Zakhara were named after the vishap, such as the [[Vishap's Teeth]] in the [[High Desert]]<ref> and the [[Vishap's Spine]] mountain range on [[Sahu]].<ref>"
