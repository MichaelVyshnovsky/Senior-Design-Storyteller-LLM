        "mainbody": "The '''nic'Epona''' ({{SingPl}}), also known as '''Epona’s daughters''', were a mystical breed of [[horse]]s native to the [[Outlands]] that had the power to traverse the [[Outer Planes]]. Their latter name derived from rumors that they were direct descendants of the goddess [[Celtic pantheon#Notable_Members|Epona]] and that their powers thus derived from her.",
        "Description": "Physically a nic’Epona resembled a horse in all ways, with the exception that they had an innate ability to change the coloration of their hide into any found on a rainbow and beyond. Each individual typically adopted one color or color-pattern as their favorite, though could still change their hue based on their mood. Their bodies also had powerful teeth and quite sharp hooves. All nic’Epona were mares,",
        "Personality": "Though they resembled a mundane horse, nic'Epona were far smarter, possessing an exceptional level of intelligence. They were rather gregarious beings, finding enjoyment from the attention and company of others. Nic'Epona also delighted in toying with those that tried to magically ''charm'' them, pretending to fall under their sway and then abandoning them on an unfriendly or inhospitable [[plane]], with [[Baator]] being a particular favorite spot to drop off irksome riders.",
        "Abilities": "The most striking innate ability of these creatures was the power to ''[[plane shift]]'' at will to anywhere in the Outer Planes, although the [[divine realm]]s of some [[deities]] were inaccessible to them unless they were invited in. Activating this power required taking a couple of steps. When it activated a nic’Epona's hooves glowed with purple fire and a rainbow silhouette of their body persisted on the plane they left for a few moments.\n\nWhenever and wherever nic’Epona galloped they could generate a momentary causeway beneath their hooves, which flared with a bright blue flame as they did so, that only they could cross for a period of one hour. This allowed them to walk over expanses of air, [[quicksand]], and water as though they were flying. This power even allowed them to traverse up vertical surfaces.\n\nNot only did it take weaponry with a +2 [[enchantment]] to harm a nic’Epona, but it was as though their whole bodies had a +2 enchantment over them, as they could harm any other creature requiring such a degree of magic to injure them. They were also unaffected by [[charm]]-related [[spell]]s and any [[magic item]]s whose effects included charming [[animal]]s, though the latter immunity wasn't widely known.",
        "Combat": "Nic’Epona were fierce and fearless combatants. They fought their teeth and hooves just like any mundane horse, though the latter were said to hit with a severity comparable to a [[battleaxe]]. When with their herd, nic'Epona were likely to spread themselves out and mount a stampede against their aggressors. Whenever combat was not going in their favor, nic'Epona would often charge right at their opponent and ''plane shift'' away just moments before making contact with them.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Nic’Epona made their home in [[Tir na Og]], a large [[divine realm]] in the Outlands belonging to the [[Celtic pantheon]]. They acted as defenders of the realm, riding in massive stampedes to overwhelm any who would threaten it.",
            "Relationships": "Nic’Epona could sometimes appear as [[favored monster|manifestations]] of the [[Seldarine]] goddess [[Sehanine Moonbow]].<ref> Beyond the service of deities, nic’Epona were regularly approached by various [[outsider]]s, [[planewalker]]s, [[petitioner]]s, and individuals from the Prime Material with offers of favors in return for transport elsewhere in the Outer Planes. However, nic’Epona rarely did so unless their trust was first earned by treating them well, entertaining them, or even providing fine gifts. When treated particularly well they would allow a being to provide them a name to which they would respond to, coming to the individual's aid from elsewhere in the planes."
