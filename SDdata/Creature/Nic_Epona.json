        "mainbody": "The nicEpona (), also known as Epona’s daughters, were a mystical breed of horses native to the Outlands that had the power to traverse the Outer Planes. Their latter name derived from rumors that they were direct descendants of the goddess Epona and that their powers thus derived from her.\nPhysically a nic’Epona resembled a horse in all ways, with the exception that they had an innate ability to change the coloration of their hide into any found on a rainbow and beyond. Each individual typically adopted one color or color-pattern as their favorite, though could still change their hue based on their mood. Their bodies also had powerful teeth and quite sharp hooves. All nic’Epona were mares,\nThough they resembled a mundane horse, nicEpona were far smarter, possessing an exceptional level of intelligence. They were rather gregarious beings, finding enjoyment from the attention and company of others. NicEpona also delighted in toying with those that tried to magically charm them, pretending to fall under their sway and then abandoning them on an unfriendly or inhospitable plane, with Baator being a particular favorite spot to drop off irksome riders.\nThe most striking innate ability of these creatures was the power to plane shift at will to anywhere in the Outer Planes, although the divine realms of some deities were inaccessible to them unless they were invited in. Activating this power required taking a couple of steps. When it activated a nic’Eponas hooves glowed with purple fire and a rainbow silhouette of their body persisted on the plane they left for a few moments.\nWhenever and wherever nic’Epona galloped they could generate a momentary causeway beneath their hooves, which flared with a bright blue flame as they did so, that only they could cross for a period of one hour. This allowed them to walk over expanses of air, quicksand, and water as though they were flying. This power even allowed them to traverse up vertical surfaces.\nNot only did it take weaponry with a +2 enchantment to harm a nic’Epona, but it was as though their whole bodies had a +2 enchantment over them, as they could harm any other creature requiring such a degree of magic to injure them. They were also unaffected by charm-related spells and any magic items whose effects included charming animals, though the latter immunity wasnt widely known.\nNic’Epona were fierce and fearless combatants. They fought their teeth and hooves just like any mundane horse, though the latter were said to hit with a severity comparable to a battleaxe. When with their herd, nicEpona were likely to spread themselves out and mount a stampede against their aggressors. Whenever combat was not going in their favor, nicEpona would often charge right at their opponent and plane shift away just moments before making contact with them.\nNicEpona were born from the union of a nicEpona and another male equine, such as a mundane horse, a pegasus, or a unicorn.\nThese creatures were often found on their own out in the wider Outer Planes, but gathered in great herds on their home plane. These herds sometimes gathered around lochs on Prime Material worlds to frolic around and engage in races before determining a change in leadership. Herds were also fiercely protective of their young foals and all members would rise up to fight anyone that tried to kidnap one, chasing them all across the planes.\nNic’Epona made their home in Tir na Og, a large divine realm in the Outlands belonging to the Celtic pantheon. They acted as defenders of the realm, riding in massive stampedes to overwhelm any who would threaten it.\nNic’Epona could sometimes appear as manifestations of the Seldarine goddess Sehanine Moonbow. Beyond the service of deities, nic’Epona were regularly approached by various outsiders, planewalkers, petitioners, and individuals from the Prime Material with offers of favors in return for transport elsewhere in the Outer Planes. However, nic’Epona rarely did so unless their trust was first earned by treating them well, entertaining them, or even providing fine gifts. When treated particularly well they would allow a being to provide them a name to which they would respond to, coming to the individuals aid from elsewhere in the planes."
