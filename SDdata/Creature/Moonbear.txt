Chultan moonbear, or simply moonbear, was a species of bears that inhabited the Jungles of Chult in northwest Faerûn.
Chultan moonbears were large creatures of impressive strength, temperamental mood, and black and dark brown fur.
It was believed in Chult that decorating a moonbears fur would grant the person the beasts strength and, possibly, temperament. Chultan beast tamers learned to train moonbears to serve as mounts are ferocious battle steeds.
A set of enchanted armor called Fured Kiuno of the Bear was decorated with Chultan moonbears fur.
