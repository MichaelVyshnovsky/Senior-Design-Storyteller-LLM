'''Chultan moonbear''', or simply '''moonbear''', was a species of [[bear]]s that inhabited the [[Jungles of Chult]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].

==Description==
Chultan moonbears were large creatures of impressive strength, temperamental mood, and black and dark brown fur.

==Ecology==
It was believed in Chult that decorating a moonbear's fur would grant the person the beast's strength and, possibly, temperament. [[Chultan]] beast tamers learned to train moonbears to serve as mounts are ferocious battle steeds.

A set of [[enchanted]] [[armor]] called ''[[Fured Kiuno of the Bear]]'' was decorated with Chultan moonbear's fur.
