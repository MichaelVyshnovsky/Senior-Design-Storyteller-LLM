        "mainbody": "'''Flinds''' were humanoid creatures related to [[gnoll]]s. They were particularly strong and vicious gnolls that would command their war band. While flinds were admired and respected by their lesser cousins, there was no love in the end for the superior breed. If not found in a leadership role over other gnolls, flinds often wound up as solitary hunters.",
        "Description": "A flind was similar in appearance to a gnoll, being a bit shorter and broader in stature. A typical flind stood {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed about {{SIrange|300|350|lb|k|long=yes}}. Aside from the size difference, flinds had less of a slope in their skull structure and their ears were more rounded.",
