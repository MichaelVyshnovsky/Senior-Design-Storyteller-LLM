        "mainbody": "'''Orpsu''' were fierce aerial predators. While they were sometimes called '''night stirges''', they had no relation to [[stirge]]s and were an entirely separate species.",
        "Description": "Orpsus lacked any kind of body hair and their spotted skin had a similar texture to leather. Their wide mouth had no lower jaw and was filled with sharp fangs. They had a long, thin flexible tail.\n\nTheir most distinguishing physical feature was their four \"horns\". Instead of arms or legs, an orpsu had four appendages that ended in a bone shaped like a sharp blade. A web of skin connected the appendages on each side of their body, which gave the appearance of wings.",
        "Abilities": "Due to their natural telepathy and incomprehensible language, they were immune to the effects of charm, domination, hold and suggestion-based spells.",
        "Combat": "Orpsu always attacked their prey from above, diving and attacking with their horns and razor-sharp fangs. Any wound inflicted by an orpsu bled continuously, until it was either wrapped in bandages or treated with magic. Once their prey was weak enough, the orpsu landed atop of them, and a dozen flexible, white tentacles appeared from a special slit on the orpsu's underside. These tentacles penetrated the skin of the prey, and drained all the blood.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Since orpsu were hematophagous creatures, their diet consisted entirely of fresh blood. They attacked both large and small creatures for their blood. [[Badger]]s, [[foxes]], [[otter]]s and [[sheep]] were particularly targeted by orpsu. [[Humanoid]]s such as [[drow]], [[duergar]] and [[human]]s were also preyed upon."
        },
        "Habitats": "Surface-dwelling orpsus were found in the deserts, plains and steppes of [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Kara-Tur]]. Subterranean orpsus were found throughout the [[Underdark]]. Orpsu made their lairs in caves or ruins.\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], these creatures could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]."
