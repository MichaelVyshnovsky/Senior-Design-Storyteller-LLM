        "mainbody": "Orpsu were fierce aerial predators. While they were sometimes called night stirges, they had no relation to stirges and were an entirely separate species.\nOrpsus lacked any kind of body hair and their spotted skin had a similar texture to leather. Their wide mouth had no lower jaw and was filled with sharp fangs. They had a long, thin flexible tail.\nTheir most distinguishing physical feature was their four \"horns\". Instead of arms or legs, an orpsu had four appendages that ended in a bone shaped like a sharp blade. A web of skin connected the appendages on each side of their body, which gave the appearance of wings. \nDue to their natural telepathy and incomprehensible language, they were immune to the effects of charm, domination, hold and suggestion-based spells.  \nOrpsu always attacked their prey from above, diving and attacking with their horns and razor-sharp fangs. Any wound inflicted by an orpsu bled continuously, until it was either wrapped in bandages or treated with magic. Once their prey was weak enough, the orpsu landed atop of them, and a dozen flexible, white tentacles appeared from a special slit on the orpsus underside. These tentacles penetrated the skin of the prey, and drained all the blood. \nOrpsu lived in swarms of up to a dozen members. Swarms started off with a pair of mature orpsu. When a swarm reached a certain size, the oldest children left to form their own swarms. \nOrpsu lacked vocal cords so they communicated solely via telepathy. They could communicate with one another from a distance of up to . They were unable to communicate in this fashion with other creatures. Their language was unique and so different from other creatures it was impossible for another creature to eavesdrop on their telepathic communications. \nSince orpsu were hematophagous creatures, their diet consisted entirely of fresh blood. They attacked both large and small creatures for their blood. Badgers, foxes, otters and sheep were particularly targeted by orpsu. Humanoids such as drow, duergar and humans were also preyed upon.\nSurface-dwelling orpsus were found in the deserts, plains and steppes of Faer√ªn and Kara-Tur. Subterranean orpsus were found throughout the Underdark. Orpsu made their lairs in caves or ruins.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, these creatures could be found in the Domains of Dread."
