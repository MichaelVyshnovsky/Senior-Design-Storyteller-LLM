These will be respectively clarified as \"demonic\", \"devilish\", and \"fiendish\" where necessary, though there is much overlap in their concepts and powers and fiendish succubi can fill roles once occupied by demonic and devilish succubi.\n\nThe male counterpart of this creature was called an '''incubus''' ({{Pronounce|INK|yoo|bus|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}).By not mentioning incubi and having succubi appear as men and women, ''[[Monster Manual 4th edition]]'' seems to imply that there are no incubi, only succubi in male form. If so, it is also possible this only applies to the devilish succubi of 4{{th}} edition. The ''[[Monster Manual 5th edition]]'' clarifies the two are interchangeable. Thus, many descriptions of succubi apply to incubi. However, the wording does not strictly contradict the existence of separate sexes, only saying the sexes are changeable.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}",
        "Description": "When uncovered in her true form, a succubus appeared as a stunningly beautiful woman of statuesque build and perfect figure, with flawless skin and red or raven-black hair, but also clawed fingers and large dark-hued or reddish bat-like wings mounted on their backs. Their eyes were said to smolder with sinister desire.Some description is taken from artwork consistent in each edition. Small horns or a tail might also be seen.Artwork often depicts succubi with horns and/or a tail, but these are not always mentioned in text, nor shown in all art. For regular shapeshifters, such features might be optional. Succubi stood on average around 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 125 pounds (57 kilograms). Demonic succubi were by far the most attractive of the otherwise-hideous tanar'ri, maybe even of all demons.\n\n[[File:Incubus-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''An incubus, for the ladies. Or the men.'']]\nIncubi, meanwhile, appeared as perfect male members of whatever race they were working with.\n\nHowever, succubi often used their shapechanging ability to assume a [[humanoid]] form, and could maintain it as a disguise for as long as they liked. Thus mortals rarely saw succubi and incubi in their true forms but they were always attractive to an observer.",
        "Personality": {
            "Activities": "[[File:Succubus-DMG1e.jpg|thumb|273px|''A succubus watches the sun set.'']]\nDemonic succubi lived to seduce and tempt mortal beings of the [[Prime Material Plane]], Many succubi and incubi were engaged almost constantly working to corrupt mortals, usually via promises of sex and other pleasures.\n\nDemonic succubi typically targeted men of energy and passion. The fiery spirits of [[human]]s meant they were easier prey, so succubi did not often concern themselves with demihumans. They were content to take things slow and work subtly. Incubi meanwhile tempted mortal females.\n\nDevilish succubi were adept at winning hearts and breaking hearts, but they also made for cunning and skilled spies and assassins. They served higher-ranked devils as scouts and advisors, as emissaries to key mortals, and of course as concubines. They tempted mortals into sin on behalf of [[Asmodeus]].\n\nFiendish succubi commonly used their ethereal form to slip through walls to reach a mortal's bedside, and linger there as they slept. Here, they filled their victim's dreams with debauched scenes and whispered of forbidden pleasures, tempting them to indulge in dark desires, appetites, and taboos. The more the succubus did this in their dreams, the more vulnerable their victim became to temptation in the waking world. Eventually, the succubus entered the mortal realm directly, in a pleasing form previously seen only in the dreams, and befriended or seduced their victim, so they could influence them directly and indulge all their desires so they would perform evil deeds of their own free will. When the victim was utterly corrupted, such as by committing three betrayals of thought, word, and deed, their soul was in the grip of the succubus, without need of contract or pledge. For a more virtuous victim, this corruption might take longer, but their downfall was all the more rewarding for the succubus. Finally, the succubus slew their victim with a kiss, and the corrupted soul went down to the Lower Planes as their prize. The succubus actually avoided charming the victim if they could help it, as the mortal would not be responsible for their actions and not truly corrupted. Thus, charming was mostly used for self-defense. Similarly, their lethal kiss was only used as a final assault or a parting shot before they escaped."
        },
        "Abilities": "With a kiss of her lips, an embrace in her arms, or something more intimate, a succubus could drain the life energy of a mortal who lacked stamina, weakening them in every aspect Moreover, as with a ''[[suggestion]]'' spell, the kiss of a demonic succubus could make the victim desire another kiss if they did not have the willpower to resist, and yet another, so they inevitably and willingly gave up their energy to the succubus. Originally, demonic succubi were presumed to be capable of any kind of ''suggestion'', without need of a kiss.\n\nIn contrast, a devilish succubus was commanding and dominant. Her kiss had instead a charming effect, causing a victim to be unable to attack her and even take attacks meant for their new mistress. If the succubus could keep her slave, then a kiss once a day was enough to keep them in her thrall, though she could only have one such slave at a time. Furthermore, at will, she could dominate the mind of another, even at a distance, though only for several seconds. They usually used this to make a worthy target come to them for the charming kiss.\n\nTo aid their seduction, a succubus or incubus could change their body, as with a ''[[polymorph]]'' or ''[[shapechange]]'' spell, into any humanoid form, as small as a [[halfling]] or tall as a [[human]] of roughly their own height and weight. Not fussy, this could even include [[demihuman]]s. They could maintain this appearance indefinitely, and it granted them skill in disguise. They could even take the forms of specific people. However, for a fiendish succubus, this disguise did not extend to whatever they carried or wore, if anything. When slain, they reverted to their fiendish forms.\n\nSuccubi were uncanny linguists, able to speak all languages, or at least just the language of their victim, as with a permanent ''[[tongues]]'' spell. Like other demons, they possessed [[telepathy]], but they preferred to speak aloud with mortals. With those they'd charmed, a fiendish succubus could forge a telepathic bond that stretched even to other [[plane]]s.\n\nDemonic succubi had an array of other powers too, being able to become ethereal (as with an ''[[oil of etherealness]]'' or ''[[ethereal jaunt]]'', though only themselves and what they carried), to [[charm person|charm people]] and [[charm monster|even monsters]], to [[detect thoughts|read minds]], to listen from afar as with ''[[clairaudience]]'', and to cross [[planes]] as with ''[[plane shift]]'' or ''[[greater teleport]]'' (but taking only themselves and what they carried). They could use such magic as often as they pleased. Moreover, once a day, demonic succubi could attempt to summon back-up if threatened. Originally, with a 40% chance of success, they could ''[[gate]]'' in a type IV or type VI demon or, very rarely, even a [[demon prince]] or [[demon lord|lord]]. After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], this came in the form of a single [[balor]] with a 40% chance of success. After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], this was but a single [[vrock]] with only a 30% success rate.\n\nWhile devilish succubi lacked all this magic, they also had a corrupting touch with which to defend themselves.\n\nFiendish succubi could become ethereal by slipping into the [[Ethereal Plane]]. They could also magically charm a humanoid, in sight up to 30 feet (9.1 meters) away, and make them obey any command they gave them. The victim might resist, especially if made to perform a harmful or suicidal action. Resisting freed their mind for 24 hours, but failure kept them beholden to the succubus for a full day. The succubus could only have one charmed victim at a time; taking another would free the last one.\n\nThey were good listeners and very observant. They were persuasive, deceptive, stealthy, and had a little skill in bonds, both tying them and escaping them, and not just recreationally.\n\nAs demons, they were immune to all fire, whether mundane or magical, and could only be hurt by moderately enchanted weapons. Later, they were considered to be immune to electricity and [[poison]]; resistant to acid, cold, and fire and to spells; and were best harmed by [[cold iron]] or good weapons. Devilish succubi were merely highly resistant to fire. Fiendish succubi were resistant to cold, fire, lightning, poison, and mundane attacks.\n\nTheir wings, when they had them, let them fly with average ability.",
        "Combat": "Lovers, not fighters, succubi fled all conflict if they could, using their claws only as a last resort, but these were only usable if revealed in their fiendish form. Rather, they focused on dodging blows and running for safety. Nevertheless, they were rarely taken by surprise.\n\nInstead, they preferred subterfuge and seduction, turning their enemies against each other, making them into loyal servants, or trying to get individuals alone. A preferred tactic was to disguise themselves and feign friendship or pretend to be a damsel in distress, especially if encountered in a dungeon, then find a moment to be alone with a potential victim where they could use their life-draining kiss.",
        "Society": "[[File:Demons.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Three demons: a [[nalfeshnee]], a [[quasit]], and a succubus. The succubus is the better-looking one.'']]\nDemonic succubi were independent of tanar'ri society, going where they liked, doing as they willed, and answering to none. The greater tanar'ri tolerated them and even accepted their independence, for they served the Abyss in their own unique way. but [[chasme]]s nursed a traditional hatred of succubi and would kill them given the chance.\n\nSuccubi and incubi were known to serve [[demon lord]]s like [[Graz'zt]] as advisors and consorts. Graz'zt never went anywhere without a retinue of six succubi, mariliths, or [[lamia]]s and his servant [[Yattara]] commanded a small squad of fellow succubi who engaged in espionage and infiltration. However, it was the demon lord [[Malcanthet]] who was renowned as the \"Queen of the Succubi\"; lesser demon lords like [[Shami-Amourae]] and [[Lynkhab]] contested for her title without success. Malcanthet was served by countless incubi and succubi in her palace, and she birthed many deadly succubi daughters to [[Pazuzu]]. Succubi also served the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]] in the Citadel of Conjurers, and in the army of the [[balor]] [[Ndulu]]. Some succubi, like [[Soneillon]], the Queen of Whispers, were free agents working their own grand plots. \n\nFiendish succubi served greater fiends of all kinds, from demons to devils, and [[night hags]] and [[rakshasa]]s and [[yugoloth]]s in between.\n\nPreferring to work alone, demonic succubi operated as singles and rarely gathered in numbers.\n\nSuccubi greatly outnumbered incubi. The reason for this was unknown, but sages speculated it was because mortal men were more easily swayed by beauty than women.",
        "Procreation": "Once it was considered that demonic succubi and incubi did not mate with one another to procreate. However, fiendish succubi and incubi could indeed reproduce to birth more of their race.\n\nThe female child of a succubus and a human male was traditionally called an [[alu-fiend]]. Those with non-evil human fathers had a slight tendency to avoid the evil of their heritage. The male child of an incubus (indeed, any lesser tanar'ri) and a human female was a [[cambion]]. Again, those with non-evil human mothers had a slight tendency to be non-evil. In the Realms ''circa'' [[1370 DR]], these terms were defined regardless of sex: a cambion was the spawn of a tanar'ri and a human or demihuman, while alu-fiends were specifically a subgroup of cambions with succubus or incubus parents. Finally, tanar'ric [[tiefling]]s were any descendants with a less than 50% demonic bloodline or even more distant ancestry. Succubi, along with [[marilith]]s, were the most common ancestors of these demon-blooded tieflings. ''Circa'' 1487 DR, a cambion was considered the child of a humanoid and a fiendish succubus or incubus, and to be as villainous as the fiendish parent.",
        "History": "''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-4800}}, the [[half-fiend]] [[sun elf]] [[House Dlardrageth]] allied with three minor noble houses—[[House Aelorothi|Aelorothi]], [[House Ealoeth|Ealoeth]], and [[House Floshin|Floshin]]—of the sun elven realm of [[Siluvanede]] and incited crossbreeding with demons to strengthen their bloodlines. Naturally, succubi and incubi lay among these demons. These unions spawned demon–elf hybrids: half-elf cambions and alu-fiends known as [[daemonfey]] and the half-elf tieflings known as [[fey'ri]]. The fey'ri had the power to shapeshift as easily as their succubi and incubi ancestors did. These now fey'ri houses, while hiding their heritage, soon began to dominate Siluvanede.<ref group=\"note\">Only ''[[Monsters of Faerûn]]'' page 73 and ''[[Lords of Darkness]]'' page 126 specify succubi and incubi as among the ancestors of the fey'ri, while other sources only refer to tanar'ri or demons.\n\n[[File:Soneillon.jpg|thumb|right|''Soneillon, the Queen of Whispers, giving sleeping to the top a bad name.'']]\nIn the [[726 DR|Year of the Dowager Lady, 726 DR]], an army of demons called the [[Scaled Horde]] emerged from the western [[Rawlinswood]] and [[Forest of Lethyr]] and conquered the kingdom of [[Impiltur]]. Commanded by the balor [[Ndulu]], they comprised mostly succubi and [[glabrezu]]. Among them was the succubus known as [[Soneillon]], who engineered the fall of the [[Durlaven]] dynasty then reigned as consort of [[Agrosh|King Agrosh the Scaled]], styling herself the Queen of Whispers. She escaped when Agrosh was slain [[729 DR|three years later]]. In the [[731 DR|Year of Visions, 731 DR]], the [[paladin]] [[Sarshel Elethlim]] defeated Ndulu in the [[Citadel of Conjurers]], ending the [[Fiend Wars]], but the balor and his demon army escaped and dispersed. Soneillon escaped imprisonment and spent centuries sowing corruption and strife in Impiltur and [[Chondath]].\n\nAfter the destruction of [[Hellgate Keep]] in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], its surviving tanar'ri denizens dispersed across the [[North]]. At least seven succubi hid within the cities of [[Everlund]], [[Sundabar]], and [[Yartar]] by [[1370 DR]].\n\nIn the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], the demon lord [[Eltab]] escaped into the Citadel of Conjurers, and released the glabrezu and succubi he found bound in its upper catacombs. They went on to serve him.\n\nWhereas succubi and incubi were previously known to be tanar'ri demons of the Abyss,{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|1711-1719}}\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]] of [[1487 DR]], the succubi had transitioned and become fiends found across the Lower Planes, and on the whole bound to none except how they preferred it.",
        "Reputation": "\"Succubus\" could be used as a nickname or title in the Realms. [[Katheera Urdo|\"The Succubus\"]] was an assassin of the [[Night Masks]] active around 1370 DR known for using contact poison on her lips and killing with a kiss. The goddess [[Sharess]] was called \"Succubus of Sensation\".",
