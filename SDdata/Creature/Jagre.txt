'''Jagres''' were extremely powerful humanoids created by [[Zaltec]] during the [[Night of Wailing]]. High ranking [[Jaguar Knights]] were transformed into [[ogre]]s and a few were later turned into jagres. Jagres were leaders of the [[orc]]s and ogres who lived in the Valley of [[Nexal]]. They were usually found in the company of orc or ogre servants.

Jagres wore magical armor made from the skin of [[displacer beast]]s, which allowed them to transform into the beasts. Some jagres went through a special ritual which bonded the displacer beast skin to their bodies so that it couldn't be removed.

==Physical attributes==
Jagres were huge, brutish humanoids. All jagres had the mark of the [[Viperhand]] branded on their chests.

==Combat==
Jagres either wielded huge [[maca]]s or engaged in unarmed combat. In displacer beast form, the jagre was able to attack with its two tentacles or its claws and bite.
