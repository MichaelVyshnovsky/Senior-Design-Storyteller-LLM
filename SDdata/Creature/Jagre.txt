Jagres were extremely powerful humanoids created by Zaltec during the Night of Wailing. High ranking Jaguar Knights were transformed into ogres and a few were later turned into jagres. Jagres were leaders of the orcs and ogres who lived in the Valley of Nexal. They were usually found in the company of orc or ogre servants.
Jagres wore magical armor made from the skin of displacer beasts, which allowed them to transform into the beasts. Some jagres went through a special ritual which bonded the displacer beast skin to their bodies so that it couldnt be removed.
Jagres were huge, brutish humanoids. All jagres had the mark of the Viperhand branded on their chests.
Jagres either wielded huge macas or engaged in unarmed combat. In displacer beast form, the jagre was able to attack with its two tentacles or its claws and bite.
