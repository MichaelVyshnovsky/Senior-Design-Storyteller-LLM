        "Description": "While they were typically ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'' in appearance, as per their name, the use of certain [[divination]] [[spell]]s such as ''[[see invisibility]]'' or ''[[true seeing]]'' showed they had the form of a slender, adult [[humanoid]].\n\nAs they were considered magical constructs, living servants were immune to [[poison]], [[paralyze|paralyzation]], and petrification, and could not be rendered unconscious."
