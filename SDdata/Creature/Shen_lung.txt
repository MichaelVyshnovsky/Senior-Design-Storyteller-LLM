'''Shen lung''', also known as '''spirit dragons''', were [[dragon]]s that were found in the rivers and lakes of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Shen lungs were physically distinguished by their enormous size, up to {{SI|151|ft|long=yes}} in length. They resembled [[pan lung]]s in appearance, but were shorter and thicker. As hatchlings they had dull scales that were either blue, green, orange or red. Sometimes polychromatic. As they aged their scaled brightened. A shen lung had ridges along its back, a spiked tail and two horns atop its head. Their gold-colored whiskers featured prominently on their snout. 

==Personality==
Unlike most dragons, shen lung were modest. They maintained cordial relationships with nature spirits. Most shen lung would take human form to observe human life in villages, as they were fascinated by humans. Humans in [[Kara-tur]] regarded shen lung as messengers from the gods and a source of good luck, often constructing shrines and temples, and held ceremonies to gain favor of a local shen lung.

==Abilities==
Though shen lung lacked wings, they were capable of flight due to a magical yellow [[pearl]] embedded in their brains, similar to that found on [[t'ien lung]]s.

Shen lung had a natural immunity to lightning and [[poison]], but were vulnerable to [[fire]]. They could surrounded themselves in an aura of ''[[water fire]]''. And they also had a unique barrier ability which prevented any regular or giant insect, arachnid, or arthropod from approaching within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.

They also had innate [[spell]]-like abilities abilities, each gained as they grew older. Three times per day a mature shen lung could use ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[control weather]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[scaly command]]''. Once per day a mature shen lung could use ''[[bane (spell)|bane]]'', ''[[bless]]'', ''[[curse]]'' and ''[[horrid wilting]]''.

==Combat==  
A shen lung would avoid combat if possible, seeking negotiations over open combat. If these negotiations failed, they unleashed savage melee attacks with their teeth, claws and spiked tail. They used their several spell-like abilities in combat.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
While precious [[gem]]s were the main component of their diet, shen lungs also subsisted on [[fish]] and small mammals.
===Homelands===
A shen lung lair was typically found at the bottom of the river or lake that they had been assigned to by the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]].
===Usage===
The pearls embedded in their brains was worth around 1,000 [[gold piece]]s, though they did not retain the magical abilities they granted shen lungs in life.

==Celestial Bureaucracy==
Within the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], Shen lung were assigned to act as guards and assistants to [[chiang lung]] and took this duty very seriously.
