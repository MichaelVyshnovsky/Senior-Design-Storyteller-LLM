Axe beaks were tall and aggressive flightless birds.
Axe beaks got their name from their sharp wedge-shaped beaks. They had strong necks and powerful legs, which they used to sprint at high speeds.
Axebeaks were faster runners than most horses.In v.3.5 rules, both axebeaks and horses have the Run feat, which allows them to move five times their normal movement speed over flat, even terrain, but axebeaks have a speed 5 higher than that of a light horse. This calculates to  for the horse and  for the axebeak. At least five Faerûnian breeds—the Calimite, Chionthar, Dambraii, Lhesperan, and Raurin—could run faster than the axebeak, attaining maximum speeds of . For comparison, in the real world, some horses can reach speeds of over , but v.3.5 consistently gives lower maximum speeds for animals, likely because the Monster Manuals include representatives of average specimens.
Axe beaks were aggressive hunters and usually hunted during daytime. They were always prone to attack any unfamiliar creatures that approached them.
The main natural weapon an axe beak used in combat was its heavy and sharp beak.
Axe beaks were most commonly found in hills and grasslands, but they were also common to the jungles of Chult and the Snout of Omgar.
Flocks of axe beaks were also believed to be protective of their young, rushing to its aid in case of danger.
The tortles of Ahoyhoy sometimes captured wild axe beaks to sell them to visitors.
