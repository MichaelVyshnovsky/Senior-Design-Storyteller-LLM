'''Lampreys''' were a species of parasitic, [[leech]]-like [[eel]]s.

==Description==
Lampreys had round sphincter-like orifices that were ringed with sharp teeth. Their bodies measured around {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in length. They typically had a sickly brown, green, or grayish coloring.

==Behavior==
These creatures had horrible tempers. They were largely driven by a desire to eat and reproduce. They tended to aggressively fight other creatures in order to protect their lairs.

==Biology==
Lamprey had a near flawless homing sense, allowing them to pinpoint creatures up to {{SI|2|mile|long=yes}} away.

Lamprey injected some form of [[poison]] into the creatures that they attached themselves. While this poison was harmless to creatures other than [[fish]], it imparted a severely sour taste upon the latter that many considered to be inedible.

==Combat==
Much like a leech or [[giant leech]], used their mouths to fasten themselves to prey, from which they gradually 
drained blood. Once full, they detached themselves from their prey, but otherwise they largely refused to let go unless killed.

==History==
The rivers that emptied into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] were plagued every few years by wide-scale attacks from preys. With fish traveling upriver, such as salmon, being the most affected. Over time many attempts were made to eradicate their species from the area, but none had proven successful.

==Sub-Species==
;[[Giant lamprey]]: A monstrous variety of the standard lamprey.
;[[Land lamprey]]: A species of lampreys that had mutated to be capable of surviving on land.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
These creatures primarily subsisted upon blood, draining it from larger species of [[fish]]. Unlike many parasitic creatures, they did not die with their host.
===Habitats===
Lampreys could be found in both fresh and saltwater environments, but were almost never encountered in shallow water, only deep waters. They typically made their lairs within underwater caves or coral formations.

In [[Faerûn]], lampreys were particularly known to inhabit the Sea of Fallen Stars, the [[Stump Bog]],{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}} the [[River Ashaba]], and [[Dragon Reach]]. Beyond Faerûn, lampreys could be found in much of [[Kara-Tur]].
===Usages===
In [[Neverwinter]], some impoverished folk were known to bake savory pies with lamprey meat as a filling.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-11-25 - Neverwinter Cuisine}}

==Trivia==
* Those who specialized in sea-based [[magic]] could [[summon]] the common variety of lamprey with the [[spell]] ''[[monster summoning I]]''.{{Cite dragon/220/Arcane Lore: Sea Magic|72}}
