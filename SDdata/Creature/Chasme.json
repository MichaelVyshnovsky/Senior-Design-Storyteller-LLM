Wary of their awful droning, the companions slew the last of Imgigs chasme.\nIn the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR, two chasme were among the horde of fiends that the balor Errtu unleashed against Drizzt DoUrden, Catti-brie, Bruenor Battlehammer, Regis, and Stumpet Rakingclaw as they approached Cryshal-Tirith in Icewind Dale. One inflicted a bleeding wound on Catti-brie, before Bruenor hacked it apart with his axe. Drizzts panther companion Guenhwyvar pounced on the other and brought it down out of the sky. These chasme had been to the Prime Material Plane before.\nIn the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, Danifae Yauntyrr, a priestess of Lolth, summoned a massive chasme known as Vakuul and asked it to carry herself and the draegloth Jeggred across the Demonweb Pits. It demanded payment, and Danifae seduced it by grasping its horn and promised the drooling thing pleasure. However, when the journey was done, she betrayed Vakuul and ordered her draegloth to kill the chasme. Jeggred tore Vakuuls forearms off before it escaped cursing back to its home plane.\nOn Mirtul 23 of 1373 DR, Phourkyn One-Eye summoned a chasme to kill members of a cabal of wizards in Thentia studying the Dracorage mythal causing the current Rage of Dragons. Ultimately, the avariel Taegan Nightwind, the faerie dragon Jivex, and the surviving wizards defeated Phourkyn and the chasme.\nIn 1485â€“1486 DR, chasme were among the demons that walked the streets of Menzoberranzan and were later sent to aid in the (failed) defense of QXorlarrin against the dwarves."
