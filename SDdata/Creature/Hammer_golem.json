        "mainbody": "'''Hammer golems''' were a rare variety of [[golem]] unique to [[dwarf|dwarven]] civilization.",
        "Description": "Hammer golems were primarily made of stone and resembled bearded dwarven warriors wearing [[plate mail]], which was crafted from [[adamantite]]. In place of forearms they had a large [[hammer]] on their right arm and a large [[axe]] or [[pickaxe]] on their left. Those built specifically for warfare had the axe, while those built specifically for mining often had a pickaxe on both arms.\n\nThey typically stood {{SI|9|ft}} tall and weighed around {{SI|2000|lbs|k}}. Like many golems, their movement was rather heavy and slow.",
        "Behavior": "These golems were only known to attack creatures if they were [[orc]]s, being prevented by them from completing a task, or ordered to by their master. Attempting to get at something that a hammer golem was guarding also fell under the second trigger. Whenever engaging orcs and their kin in combat, hammer golems always let out a hollow roar.",
        "Abilities": "Hammer golems were immune to most [[spell]]s, except for ''[[wish]]'' and ''[[stone to flesh]]''. In addition, they could only be harmed by weapons with a ''+1 or greater [[item enchantment|enchantment]].''\n\nThrough their weaponry they were capable of unleashing a sort of pounding force that was comparable to the spell ''[[repulsion]]''.",
        "Combat": "[[File:HammerGolem.png|thumb|''A hammer golem sentry.'']]\nWhen lacking a master, hammer golems would fight creatures around them until they either fled or were killed. However, they would relentlessly pursue the destruction of [[goblinoid]]s.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Creation": "The process of creating hammer golems was highly secret, comparable to that of the most powerful dwarven magical weapons. They were only known to be forged by the High Old Ones, the high [[priest]]s of the [[Morndinsamman]] faith.",
            "Usage": "Hammer golems were typically used as guards, warriors, and even miners.\n\nBeyond their use by mortal dwarves, they were often divine agents of many deities within the Morndinsamman. They were typically used by the dwarven gods [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], [[Deep Duerra]], [[Gorm Gulthyn]], [[Laduguer]], and [[Moradin]]."
        },
        "History": "Some time prior to [[-75 DR]], four hammer golems were constructed in the land of [[Tethyr]] to guard the chapel-house of the [[Knights of the Crescent Moon]] that stood in the [[Omlarandin Mountains]], the [[Chapel of the Blooded Moon]]. After the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]], in -75 DR the hammer golems were situated in tunnels deep beneath the chapel. They were tasked with guarding the Knights of the Crescent Moon as they slept in stasis from the spell ''[[Phezult's sleep of ages]]'', waiting for the prophesied day in which they would awaken to fight the [[beholder]]s once more.\n\nHammer golems were detailed in a book about horrors of [[Underdark]], ''[[True Tales of Underearth]]'' by Emerald Hapworth of Waterdeep in the mid 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dragon/193/Live Statues and Stone Men|19}}\n\nThe hammer golems remained relatively undisturbed for centuries until [[1370 DR]], when the beholder [[Vaxall]] and his [[Doom Brigade]] stormed the complex with the intention of destroying the Knights of the Crescent Moon. His Doom Brigade managed to destroy two of the four hammer golems, leaving the group of [[adventurer]]s on their trail to face the others.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|51, 56, 60}}",
        "Notable Hammer Golems": "* Within the deepest depths of the [[Great Rift]], hammer golems stood as protectors of the [[Great Shieldhall of Eternal Vigilance]], the base of operations for the guardians of the entrance to the [[Deep Lands]]."
