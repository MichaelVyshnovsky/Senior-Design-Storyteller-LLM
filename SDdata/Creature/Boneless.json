        "mainbody": "oneless were a type of undead unique to the Domains of Dread that arose from one or more corpses lacking their skeleton, typically humanoid corpses though any creature that naturally had a skeleton could work.There are no known instances of boneless in a Forgotten Realms product. However, they are listed in Powers & Pantheons as one of many creatures that could appear in the Realms to act on behalf of Velsharoon. For this reason, boneless are documented in this article.\nSome boneless were capable of assuming a lanky humanoid form. Such forms had long withered limbs, necks that were like flexible cords, and shrunken wrinkled heads, and fetid skin that was of a translucent reddish-brown hue. They were occasionally seen in loose-fitting rags, though these were often stitched directly onto their skin by their master. Such boneless generally moved with a lurching uncertainty, occasionally dropping to all fours for an animalistic sprint.\nOther boneless were incapable of taking on a humanoid form and would instead drape themselves upon the frame of a skeleton or zombie.\nBoth types of boneless were incredibly flexible and strong, capable of using the pliability of their bodies to compress themselves and squeeze through small gaps. However, in order to maintain this a boneless needed to be saturated in a body of water once per week. Failure to do so would cause the boneless to stiffen up, lose their grappling prowess, and become especially vulnerable to fire.\nBoneless were capable of seeing in areas of total darkness. They were immune to poisons, charm spells, fear spells, sleep spells, and death magic. Like most undead, they were vulnerable to holy water, holy symbols, and the spell turn undead.\nBoneless that could take on a humanoid form were capable of wielding weapons, but typically slapped foes with their withered hands. Similarly, those who couldnt would simply slam their bodies against foes.\nBoth those who could and those who couldnt take on a humanoid form were quite adept at grappling opponents, owing to their flexibility. When in their more gelatinous form, the boneless would wrap themselves around their targets, obscuring their vision and obstructing their airways. Upon dying a boneless would detach from anything it was attached to.\nMost boneless in the Domains of Dread arose from corpses that had suffered brutal ends, such as being crushed or skinned, while others were brought to life by means of necromancy, from such things as abattoirs, necromantic slurries, or scraps of failed experiments.\nWithin the Domains of Dread, boneless were notably found in the Realms-relevant domains of Barovia, HarAkir, and Hazlan.\nA boneless retained the capacity to understand the languages it had known in life, but was incapable of speaking.\nBoneless were sometimes known to act as servants of Velsharoon, the neutral evil Faer√ªnian demigod of necromancy."
