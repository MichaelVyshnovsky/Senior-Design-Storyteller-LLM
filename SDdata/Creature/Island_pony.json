        "mainbody": "The island pony was a type of pony that was native to the islands of the Trackless Sea. They were commonly kept by the Illuskan people and, despite the islanders lack of horsemanship, served them well throughout the development of their civilization.\nThese equines were rather large and muscular for a breed of pony. They had broad barrel-chests and resilient hooves that typically did not need to be shoed.\nIsland ponies were hearty, sure-footed steeds."
