'''Bluebird''' was a species of small blue-feathered [[bird]] found in the [[Northwest Faerûn]], the forest of [[Cormanthor]], and in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Ecology==
Trees in the [[Midwood]] of Cormanthor were homes to many species of forest wildlife, including chirping bluebirds.

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], popularity of keeping bluebirds as pets in [[Cormyr]] increased and local breeders in the city of [[Wheloon]] started training these little blue animals.

[[Water naga]]s inhabiting Cormanthor preyed on bluebirds, slithering up the tree trunks in search of their nests. [[Shikki-gaki]], a type of [[undead]] spirit found in the land of [[Kara-Tur]], were known to devour bluebirds after turning to evil.

Goddess [[Lliira]], the Mistress of Revels, counted bluebirds among her beloved animals{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12}} and was known to manifest herself as a bluebird. The deity [[Tyche]] favored bluebirds as well.
