        "Description": "Skereloths were insectoid in appearance, and supported by six legs of which they could walk on two, four, or all six, with no apparent difficulty. They had pale, red-gray skin which paled further to milky-white when they were scared, which they almost always were.",
        "Personality": "Least loyal among the yugoloths, skeroloths would quickly betray their masters when presented with even the faintest chance of greater things. They approached powerful beings with either sycophantic flattery or mewling cries for mercy, while those they thought were weak were always their first targets for attack.",
        "Abilities": "Skeroloths were able to summon other members of their kind if pressed, and could both burrow underground and scale walls. Most amazingly and pathetic was their strange ability to cower, cringing in fear so piteously that many foes could not bring themselves to harm them.",
        "Combat": "Skeroloths were unreliable, treacherous, and weak opponents compared to practically any other yugoloths, relying on ambushes or swarming to take down their adversaries. Unless gathered and commanded by more powerful yugoloths, they could not be relied upon to finish a battle except against very feeble foes.",
        "Society": "Skeroloths were near-universally regarded as the contemptible scum of any yugoloth army. Despite being present in yugoloth fighting forces, they were not thought to be truly a part of them. At best, they were of use as spies, scouts, and thieves.{{Cite dungeon/150/Dergholoth}}\n\nSkeroloths could be summoned using a ''[[summon monster IV]]'' spell.",
        "History": "A trap set by the [[sarrukh]] on a door in one of their temples to seal away a tomb would summon a [[piscoloth]], that could in turn summon skeroloths.<ref>"
