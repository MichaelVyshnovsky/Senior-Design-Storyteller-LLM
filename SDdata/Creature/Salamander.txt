'''Salamanders''', were large [[elemental]], [[reptile|reptilian]] [[humanoid]]s. Despite the names, salamanders were not related to [[frost salamander]]s.<ref>

==Description==
Salamanders were serpentine creatures with a humanoid torso, head, and arms, albeit with spines rising from their head, arms, and spine.

==Personality==
Salamanders tended to be greedy and cruel.
<!--==Abilities==-->
==Combat==
Salamanders often wielded [[spear]]s. They used their tails to constrict their enemies. Their skin was so hot that even the merest touch caused burns.

==Society==
Salamanders had an excellent culture of metalsmithing and creating weapons that utilized the power of flame.

Salamanders formed feudal societies led by kings/queens and dukes/duchesses. Slaves and lesser elemental creatures made up the peasant class.

==Ecology==
===Life Cycle===
Salamanders reproduced asexually, producing a single larva every ten years. These larvae, called [[fire snake]]s, were small and unintelligent. Many went on to become the somewhat larger and more intelligent [[flamebrother salamander]]s, although others remained fire snakes for their entire lives. From there, some flamebrothers became [[average salamander]]s, and those few average salamanders that were lucky and powerful enough to survive a thousand years became [[noble salamander]]s.

===Homelands===
Salamanders originated on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. A significant population of them migrated from the Plane of Fire via ''[[portal]]s'' to the [[Firelands]] and the [[Peaks of Flame]] in [[Chult]]. These salamanders posed a threat to the [[Mines of Segol]] and the [[Hazur Mountains]]. In the same manner salamanders also settled [[the sun]] of [[Realmspace]].<ref>

===Relationships===
The [[Blade Kingdoms]] were blessed with plumbing technology. The palaces and nobles' homes had intricate networks of [[copper]] plumbing set throughout and the hot water was generated via salamanders who stoked the boiler flames with [[coal]] and their own immense body heat. A group of salamanders lived in the [[Palace of Sumbria]]'s higher floors and pumped hot water to the kitchens, council chambers and bedchambers.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] struck a deal to summon an army of salamanders to invade their neighbors, however after they attempting to renege on this deal, the salamanders turned against them in what came to be called the [[Salamander War]].{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|142}}
