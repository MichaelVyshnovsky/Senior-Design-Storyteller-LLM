'''Lupinals''' were wolf-like [[guardinal]]s that lived in [[Elysium]] and the [[House of Nature]].<ref> They often formed temporary packs as they roamed their celestial home, but were just as often solitary.

==Description==
Lupinals looked half-man, half-[[wolf]], with a wolf-like face, silver-grey fur, and legs on a humanoid body. Although they could be mistaken for [[Werewolf|werewolves]], lupinals were considerably more intelligent and poised.

==Combat==
Like most guardinals, lupinals were normally peaceful but ferocious when in a fight. They were constantly vigilant against evil incursions, and they were typically suspicious of strangers as well. Lupinals had a variety of spell-like abilities, were very good at stealth (which they used to ambush enemies), and used pack tactics to great effect while fighting.

==Society==
The [[Talisid and the Five Companions|ruler]] of the lupinals was [[Kharash]] the Stalker.<ref> Lupinals were also known to serve the goddess [[Mystra]].<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|13}}
