Lupinals were wolf-like guardinals that lived in Elysium and the House of Nature. They often formed temporary packs as they roamed their celestial home, but were just as often solitary.
Lupinals looked half-man, half-wolf, with a wolf-like face, silver-grey fur, and legs on a humanoid body. Although they could be mistaken for werewolves, lupinals were considerably more intelligent and poised.
Like most guardinals, lupinals were normally peaceful but ferocious when in a fight. They were constantly vigilant against evil incursions, and they were typically suspicious of strangers as well. Lupinals had a variety of spell-like abilities, were very good at stealth (which they used to ambush enemies), and used pack tactics to great effect while fighting.
The ruler of the lupinals was Kharash the Stalker. Lupinals were also known to serve the goddess Mystra.
