        "mainbody": "A '''jarrlak''' was a type of [[demon]] found within the [[Abyss]].  Jarrlaks were known both for their intelligence and their sadism, and often toyed with their victims, trapping them in blocks of ice.  Jarrlaks often aligned themselves with various [[demon lord]]s in an effort to acquire power, but they just as often struck out on their own to attempt to establish control over areas of heavy snow and cold.",
        "Abilities": "Jarrlaks were able to both entomb their enemies in ice as well as raise solid walls of ice.",
        "Combat": "Jarrlaks attempted to handle enemies one by one, preferring ideally to freeze each one before moving on to the next."
