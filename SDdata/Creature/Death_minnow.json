        "mainbody": "'''Death minnows''' were a deceptively dangerous species of deep sea, magically created [[fish]], meant to act as guardians of undersea lairs and treasure troves.",
        "Description": "These fish sported orange scales and were usually found to be as small as {{SI|2|in|long=yes}}, however, they with their innate magical ability they can grow to be as large as {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}}. They were quite agile, able to evade most attacks while in their minute state.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures had only an animal level of intellect, but ensured the area surrounding whatever they were assigned to guard remained clear of nosy predators, such as [[adventurer]]s. All death minnows were stilled with an instinctual pressure to not release swallowed prey under any circumstances, a drive that persisted in their body even once killed.",
        "Abilities": "Rather than sight, these fish relied upon pressure-sensitive lateral lines to detect other creatures. They were endowed with a magical ability that mimicked the spell ''[[enlarge/reduce]]'', allowing them to increase and shrink their body mass at will. Any creature swallowed by a death minnow's powerful suction in its enlarged state would likewise shrink down in size when the death minnow ''reduced'' its mass. If ''[[dispel magic]]'' was ever cast upon them, their bodies was enlarge to their maximum size of {{SI|8|ft}}.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Usages": "The blood of these creatures could be utilized to make [[ink]] for [[spell scroll]]s of ''enlarge'' or ''reduce''. Their bodies were also edible, sporting a flavor akin to kippered [[herring]]."

        "History": "The first death minnows were created by undersea sorcerers, though its unknown who or what race they were, with some believing them to be [[aboleth]]s and others [[sahuagin]].\n\nTwo death minnows acted as guardians of treasure in the [[Temple of Eadro]] in [[Voalidru]]. After both the temple and city were abandoned, the fish were left to skulk around for months, until they were attracted by the [[kraken]] [[Qol'in'taroq]]'s call. In their efforts to investigate the noise, the minnows became trapped in the temple's pantry. Over time, for reasons unknown, the minnows did not bother the kraken's sahuagin minions whenever they came twice a day to the pantry for food, who unaware of the presence of the dangerous sometime. Sometime later, in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, a group of adventurers traveling through the ruined temple to put an end to the kraken stumbled upon the two death minnows in the pantry and were attacked.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|77}}"
