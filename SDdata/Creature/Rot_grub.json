If not, a remove disease spell would be needed to eliminate them before they reached a victims heart.\nIn 1357 DR, rot grubs could occasionally be found in the sewers of Waterdeep.\nA single swarm of rot grubs was capable of laying over ten thousand eggs on a decaying body before they perished. If these bodies were not burned, then their eggs would hatch after a period of one month.\nRot grubs were known to feed upon both dead and living flesh.\nIn the forest of Cormanthor, rot grubs were often found in the bark of treants, where they helped combat tube wilt by eating the rotten wood and the fungal infection that caused it.\nOutside of Cormanthor, they were most often found in piles of offal or dung, attracted by movement, they would burrow into the nearest moving object and eat whatever they could.\nSome gnolls were known to capture rot grubs and use them to torture their captives in rites to Yeenoghu. Some kobolds would capture them and place them in small, ceramic containers to be thrown at their enemies. And some bugbears were known to use them as additions to their traps or pits to dispose of bodies in."
