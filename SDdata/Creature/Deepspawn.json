            "Abilities": "A deepspawn could birth a copy of any creature native to the [[Material Plane]].{{Cite dungeon/194/Eye on the Realms: Thormil's Secret}}\n\nOnly an exact duplicate of a creature could be created by a deepspawn, and spawn even retained the learned abilities and dim memories of the original creature. Spawn had an intense, inborn loyalty to their deepspawn \"parent\" that could not be shaken, even through [[magic]]."

        "Personality": "[[File:DeepSpawn-2e.png|thumb|250px|''A depiction of a deepspawn.'']]Deepspawn possessed genius intellect, which was paired with an inscrutable worldview that made them quite dangerous. They laired in caves and ruins, often well defended by deadly [[trap]]s and patrolling spawn. They created spawn to serve and protect them.",
        "Combat": "Deepspawn preferred to fight on their own terms, and would bury themselves for protection and await enemies in easily defended&mdash;but also easily escapable&mdash;locations. They used all six of their tentacle- and jaw-arms to strike at foes simultaneously, and would wrap their tentacles around enemies to constrict them. They also possessed the innate ability to cast certain [[spell]]s, including ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', and ''[[heal]]''.",
        "History": "Over the centuries, the deepspawn fended off attacks by the dwarves, the [[duergar]], the [[drow]], and monstrous beings like [[aboleth]]s, [[cloaker]]s, and [[illithid]]s.\n\nThe first to encounter the deepspawn were the [[gold dwarf|dwarves]] of the [[Deep Kingdom]] beneath the eastern [[Shaar]], which swiftly began a long campaign to exterminate or make use of the strange monsters.\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasias]] in the [[-183 DR|Year of Larks,&minus;183 DR]], [[Darrom Ithal]], the first king of [[Tethyr]], was assassinated by the [[teleport]]ation of a deepspawn directly into his throne room. This had been orchestrated by [[Amir Tarseth]], the king's brother-in-law and leader of [[Clan Tarseth]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|679}}, the recently founded town of [[Hillsfar]] was nearly destroyed by an army of spawn emerging from the [[Beast Marches]], with the horde only being contained by winter of that year thanks to assistance from [[Cormanthyr]].\n\nDuring the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] in the mid-14th century DR, a deepspawn known as [[The One Below]] laired below the surface of the city of [[Zazesspur]]. On [[Mirtul 3]], during a time period known as the [[Days of Terror]], [[Zaranda Star]] and her [[Star Protective Services]] slew the monster and ended its chaos. It had been allied with the [[Twisted Rune]] and a [[tanar'ri]]. After that deepspawn's death, a second deepspawn, known as [[Clusterfang]], joined the Rune and took residence under the city in its predecessor's place.\n\n[[File:Deepspawn and trolls.png|thumb|left|300px|''Deepspawn and its [[troll]]s under [[Hellgate Keep]].'']]In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the mad wizard [[Radoc]] had a deepspawn in his forces that helped him to spawn many [[mongrelfolk]]s, [[troll]]s, and other types of monstrous minions. In [[1367 DR]], having gotten word that his foe [[Grintharke]] had fallen, Radoc took the deepspawn and his other forces to assault [[Hellgate Keep]]. During this siege the deepspawn crawled underground and hid itself within an underground cave, close to the [[Hellgate Keep#Chambers Below|Chambers Below]]. After the siege on Hellgate Keep had failed, that deepspawn remained within this cave, sparingly using its forces against the Keep's ruler, [[Kaanyr Vhok]], and rallying his forces against him. It's actions soon came to the attention of the [[cambion]], who proceeded to engage in many negotiations with the deepspawn that were half-hearted, for neither was willing to be subservient to the other. Some time after the Keep's destruction in [[1369 DR]], Vhok and his men slew the deepspawn's minions, injured it, and stole its accumulated treasures before caving in its lair. The deepspawn managed to survive this, subsisting off of [[spider]]s, [[worm]]s, and the trolls it would spawn.\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, a business called [[Hired Horrors]] in [[Skullport]] began selling deepspawn for ten thousand [[gold pieces]] each. This operation was run by a cabal of four [[wizard]]s&mdash;[[Aurin|Aurin the Generous]], [[Chantos Graybeard]], [[Ysele|Ysele the Cat]], and Lord [[Ithvar Wordkiller]]&mdash;who had figured out how to breed the deepspawn. Their operation catered to clientele looking to stock dungeons with monsters, and was capable of transporting deepspawn to anywhere on [[Toril]].\n\nBy the 1370s DR, the [[Zhentarim]] had begun abducting deepspawn and placing them along the caravan routes used by their merchant rivals.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that a deepspawn dwelled within the jungle of [[Jundarwood]], though throughout [[Faerûn]]ian history deepspawn were often a source of blame for strange happenings.{{Cite polyhedron/129/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms|11}}\n\nSome hunters and sages in the [[Border Kingdoms]] voiced suspicion that [[Bloutar]]rans had installed a deepspawn within a cave in the forest north of their town as it seemed that those townspeople always came back from a [[stag]] hunt with two or more prizes in hand.{{Cite polyhedron/116/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms: Blackbarn and Bloutar|11}}\n\nAround [[1479 DR]], it was rumored that the farmer [[Nars Thormil]], who lived near [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]], used a deepspawn he had captured to duplicate [[thimdror]]s and sell them to the best eateries in [[Saerloon]] and other nearby settlements.{{Cite dungeon/194/Eye on the Realms: Thormil's Secret|30-31}}",
