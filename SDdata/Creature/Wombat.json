        "Description": "Wombats appeared somewhat similar to [[beaver]]s or small [[bear]]s, with flat noses, bristly whiskers, rounded ears, short legs, and particularly heavy front claws. Their bodies appeared powerful, and they were covered in coarse fur.",
        "History": "Some believed that wombats had been brought to [[Toril]] from [[Earth|another world]] through [[portal]]s.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-10-21 - Wombat Origins}}",
        "Notable Wombats": "An island off the coast of [[Orlil]] was home to a population of intelligent wombats divided into small settlements, each with a population of no more than 50, give or take the odd [[platypus]].\n\nTwo intelligent wombats, [[Byrt]] and [[Lugg]], became known outside of their island home as companions of [[Artus Cimber]] starting in the {{yearlinkName|1362}}.{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}}",
        "Trivia": "* [[Zox Clammersham]], a [[rock gnome]] tinkerer stationed in [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, used a [[safe]] which featured pictographs of burrowing animals in lieu of numbers; one of these pictographs depicted a wombat.\n* On some worlds, [[hippopotamus]]-sized desert-dwelling relatives of wombats called [[w:wikipedia:diprotodon|diprotodons]] were known."
