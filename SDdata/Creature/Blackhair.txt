A '''blackhair''' was a breed of [[horse]] originating from the village and vale of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}

==Description==
It was a rugged equine, with short legs and a [[pony]]-like build yet reaching the weight and breath of a [[warhorse]], albeit not as tall. Their coats were thick and shaggy with black and dark-brown colors, from whence came their name. A unique adaptation of the breed was a bony plate shielding the [[Wikipedia:Horse_hoof#The_sole|sole of the hoof]] from loose stones.

==Abilities==
Blackhairs were renowned for their strength and endurance, and especially their surefootedness over rocks and mountain slopes. They could carry {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} with ease, and up to {{SI|420|lb|k|long=yes}} at a slow pace.

==Availability==
These horses were bred and trained in the well-fenced farms west of the road in Maskyr's Eye. Two of the most notable breeders ''circa'' [[1357 DR]] were [[Gundul Hulvesper]] of [[Hulvesper Farm]] and [[Elephon Stoneshoulder]] of [[Northreach Farm]]. For fear of horse thieves, stable-hands and laborers from beyond the vale were rarely hired at these farms.

The blackhair breed was much-sought-after in the Vast, with a single fully trained animal going for up 400 [[gold piece]]s in the stock markets of [[Hlintar]] or [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]]. However, local Maskyrvians rarely paid more than 75 gold pieces unless they were expected to take it out of the vale to far-off lands for war, trade, or long-distance travel.
