A '''watchghost''', or an '''unsleeping guardian''', was a rare and powerful [[undead]] being that was as intelligent as it was in life.

==Description==
The upper parts of watchghosts, such as their arms, were made of white flesh, but their legs and torso were skeletal. Their eyes appeared to be deep dark holes that sunk into their face. As a whole, unsleeping guardians looked more elegant and sophisticated than other undead.

Watchghosts were not mindless like typical undead, and retained their full intelligence after rising in undeath.

==Abilities==
These unique undead could easily detect all [[magic]]al items within {{SI|60|ft}} by illuminating them in an icy-white light. As this could be cast at will, it allowed for watchghosts to easily spot intruders, and even lure more monsters into a fight. If they wished to speak with their foes, they spoke as they did in life, but their voice was often accompanied by whispers.

Such creatures did not only have a singular form; they could become insubstantial whenever they chose. Their insubstantial form made them immune to any sort of standard physical attack (but magic weapons were more effective), though in this state they also did no damage. This form allowed them to pass through solid matter, such as rock and earth, as well as allowing them to [[fly]]. Thus, they could use this form to watch for potential attackers, and take them by surprise.

==Personality==
Bound watchghosts would only follow the wishes of their masters. However, should their masters be killed, they would completely change. These watchghosts, known as "wild" or "free" watchghosts, would gain free will. Thus, they may have chosen to aid beings, or seek revenge on those that caused their initial death.

==Combat==
These ferocious guardians were troublesome to combat. Because of the nature of their undead state, it was impossible to [[turn undead|turn]] them. In addition, they were immune to [[spell]]s that involved them becoming [[charm]]ed, being put to [[sleep]], and [[hold monster|held]]. In addition, they were also fully immune to all [[poison]]s and cold-based damage, being [[petrify|petrified]] or [[polymorph]]ed, and [[death magic]]. They were even able to resist other spells, and [[holy symbol]]s and [[holy water]] had no effect at all. Powerful [[cleric]]s that usually dominated undead creatures, such as by turning them or dousing them in holy water, would find themselves utterly useless.

Watchghosts did not only have great defensive capabilities and a large set of immunities, but could also deal great damage. They usually attacked with cold-based abilities, such as ''[[chilling touch]]'', but up to twelve times per day, watchghosts could send out ''[[chill ray]]s''. These freezing-cold light rays had a range of {{SI|90|ft}} and could penetrate all basic spell barriers and magical protections. If the ray managed to get through, it would hurt the victim and drain them of their energy, causing them to be ''[[slow]]ed'' for up to 24 minutes.

==Ecology==
These undead had no need for consumption, and could not reproduce. Thus, they usually have very little impact on ecosystems.

===Creation===
Unlike other undead created by standard [[necromancy]] [[spell]]s, watchghosts could only be created by a specific spell, ''[[create watchghost]]''. Only master necromancers could cast such a powerful spell, and must have been willing to bind their lifeforce, spend plentiful [[gold]], and even use parts of their own body, to summon watchghosts.

===Uses===
Once created, watchghosts were fully under the command of their masters, which were usually [[lich]]es or powerful [[vampire]]s. As they were intelligent, they were often tasked to protect items of great value, or tombs. They were fully loyal to their masters, and were bound to them until their masters were slain. Watchghosts could be made to work together, if ordered to do so.

==History==
In the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Hasklar's Arms & Armor]], a notable [[weapon]]s store in [[Yartar]] was protected by a watchghost. The watchghost wielded the store's weapons, causing customers to believe that they were animated.

==Rumors & Legends==
The stories of watchghosts were told all throughout [[Faerûn]]. The dungeons of [[Castle Waterdeep]] were rumored to be haunted by several of these undead, and some even said that the watchghosts lurked in the secret passages of the palace. Other rumors mention that watchghosts were behind the murder of several [[Shadow Thieves]].

[[Elysree Csimaee]], the [[Harper]] of [[Berdusk]], was believed to have a watchghost of her own. It would watch over her at all times. The legend became so popular that a ballad was written about it, and was known as ''[[Elysree's Phantom Lover]]''.

The [[Moonlit Tower]] was said to house creatures such as [[steel shadow]]s and watchghosts.

==Notable Watchghosts==
* [[The Silent One]], a watchghost rumored to be [[Orghalor Hawkgauntlet]], who had risen in undeath.
* [[Setana]] of the [[Crowing Cockatrice]], a watchghost barmaid of [[Skullport]].
* [[Ieiridauna Amalree]], a watchghost that watched over [[Mirt]]'s mansion in [[Waterdeep]].<ref>
* [[Krothaer]] "The Cruel", a watchghost that haunted [[The Hungry Haunting]] in [[Oeble]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/138/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|9}}
* The [[Mosstone]] library of [[Seirystrum]] had a number of watchghost guardians that protected its contests from [[bookworm]]s and other predators. Though they also had other sacred and secret tasks, including something [[Volothamp Geddarm]] called "The Waiting."<ref name="VGtBGII-p103>
* The [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Selûne]] in [[Waterdeep]] had a watchghost guarding its cimeliarch (treasury). Only [[Naneatha Suaril]] knew their identity and history.<ref>
