'''Fachan''', also known as '''Gruumsh-kin''', were a malevolent sentient species.

==Description==
The fachan was one of the most unusual-looking creatures on [[Toril]]. It had one leg and a single large foot with six toes. In the center of its face was a single large eye, and growing from the center of its chest was a single arm. Its face and skin resembled that of [[ogre]]s and [[orcs]]. Their mouth was filled with sharp teeth, which were usually rotting and filthy.

==Personality==
Fachan were cruel creatures, often torturing their prey before eating them.

==Abilities==
Fachan had powerful muscles that allowed them to jump up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} vertically and {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} horizontally. Fachan had an excellent sense of hearing.

==Combat==
The primary battle tactic of a fachan was to ambush their target. They usually hid within the shallow water of their swamp, leaping out when their target was within range. Fachan could use most one-handed weapons but preferred [[axe]]s, [[club]]s, [[flail]]s and [[sword]]s. A fachan skull was unusually thick, and an impact could stun a target, even if the target was wearing armor. A bite from a fachan delivered a potent [[poison]] that paralyzed its victim. Once paralyzed, the fachan dragged the unfortunate victim underwater, holding them there until they drowned.

==Society==
Fachan lived communally as tribes. A typical fachan village was composed of up to thirty individuals living in six large structures called lodges, which resembled large [[beaver]] lodges. Each lodge was up to {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in diameter and were camouflaged.

==Ecology==
Fachan were omnivores but their favorite meal was the meat from [[demihuman]]s and [[human]]s.

===Habitat===
Fachan could be found living in marshes, swamps and wetlands south of the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. Fachan villages are known to be within the swamps of [[Durpar]], [[Halruaa]], and [[Turmish]]. The largest known fachan settlement was located within the [[Spider Swamp]] in [[Calimshan]], although it was suspected even larger fachan settlements could be found within the swamps of [[Chult]] and [[Zakhara]].

==Uses==
The feet of two fachan could be, if properly enchanted and treated, made into a pair of ''[[boots of striding and springing]]''. The ear drum and canal of a fachan could be used as a [[material component]] in the brewing of a ''[[potion of clairaudience]]''.
