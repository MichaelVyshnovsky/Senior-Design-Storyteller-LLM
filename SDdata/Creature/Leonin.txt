'''Leonin''' were proud feline [[lion]]-like [[humanoid]]s from the plane of [[Theros]], shielded from the rest of the multiverse by its [[god]]s. They were virtually unheard of on the world of [[Toril]].

==Description==
[[File:Leonin female.png|thumb|''A female leonin with her deadly claws.''|290x290px]]
Leonin were muscular and powerful humanoids, towering over a [[human]], growing beyond {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}}, sometimes reaching {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}}. Their bodies were covered in tawny fur, their hands ended in sharp retractible feline claws, their feet were cat-like, and their tails were long, covered in the same fur color as the rest of their bodies. The leonin species were sexually dimorphic, with males growing thick manes of various colors, from gold to black, while females had short fur, similar to lions. All leonin were capable of unleashing fearsome thunderous roars.

==Personality==
Leonin were known for their confident and prideful personality, as well as the social structure of nomadic lion-like pride in the shining plains of [[Oreskos]]. Much of the leonin people lived in defiance of the gods of Theros and rarely interacted with other races. They loved brawls and fighting, reinforced by a brash and impulsive personality, quick to anger but quick to forgive. They took offense to criticisms or intolerance. Leonin loved verbal fighting as much as they did physical conflicts. They often playfully brawled and wrestled and engaged in aggressive debates to exercise mind and body. 

==Abilities==
Leonin's most notable qualities were their constitution and brute strength. They could see in the dark within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} perfectly in shades of gray.

==Combat==

In combat, leonin were fierce opponents even if unarmed due to their retractible rending claws. They possessed natural hunter's instinct which gave them an upper hand in battle as well as when doing feats of athleticism, survival, and intimidation. Their fearsome roar could send opponents running in terror.

==Society==
Just like regular lions, leonin prides were led by females. Each pride had its own matron leader, as social status came with age for the leonin. These old and respected females bore the title of ''zibynth'', or speaker. And the prides were ruled by the Councils of Matriarchs â€“ the most respected and wise matrons. Leonin prides were also used to identify and name individuals. They had a personal name, followed by the pride's name. Some of the female names included Ecate, Gragonde, Iadma, Seza, and Zior, and some of the most common male names were Apto, Bryguz, Eremoz, Pyxathor, or Xior. Pride names: Embereye, Flintclaw, Sunguides, and other similar names. Leonin pride names were their family names and appropriately so, all members of a pride treated eachother with respect as family. All members of the pride shared responsibilities.

As members of the pride reached adulthood, females often stayed within their mother's pride, while males left to seek a new home and new partners. A typical pride sheltered in dens or put up tent cities as they moved across the land, depending on the time of the year.

Leonin rarely followed a religion, believing themselves to be independent and self-sufficient and gods to be not worthy of worship. Leonin forsook the worship of the gods of Theros after suffering at the hands of a tyrant in centuries past.

==Ecology==
Leonin aged at the same speed as humans and had a comparable lifespan.

==History==
[[File:Leonin Yanna.png|thumb|''Yanna, the unlucky plane-hopping leonin.''|290x290px]]
In the late 1480s [[DR]], a channeling of power from across the planes occurred in the [[Icewind Dale]] region of Toril, potentially due to the [[Everlasting Rime]] or some other meddling on the goddess [[Auril]]'s part. This meddling with planar magic caused some creatures from other worlds to be dragged into Icewind Dale. This included a female leonin called [[Yanna]], who was watching her plane's sun set over Oreskos when she was transported. While chasing after a pack of [[satyr]]s in that region, she ran into the [[cleric]] [[Celeste]] and explained her situation.
