They sold for two [[copper piece]]s.",

            "Moor": "The moor rabbit was found in the region of [[High Moor]]. They were rather scrawny, but quite tough. Their fur was usually a light brown fur, with white tuffs at the tips of their ears. They competed with the region's native [[rat|moor rats]] for food and living space.",
            "Spiny": "The spiny rabbit was found in the forest of [[Cormanthor]]. It has red fur and bright green eyes, but otherwise resembled a normal rabbit. It was usually calm and placid, but if startled, three spines on its stomach became erect. These spines gave the rabbit its name, and could prove deadly if they pierced the skin.<ref>",
            "Whistling": "The sage [[Elminster]] heard tales of a kind of rabbit living in the [[Brynwood]] in [[the Vast]] that was capable of whistling like a [[canary]]. It could even be taught a surprising number of tunes."

Rabbits were a common sight in the city-states of the [[Blade Kingdoms]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].\n\nIn the [[Unapproachable East]], rabbits could be found in the [[Yuirwood]] and [[Ashenwood]].\n\nRabbits were quite abundant on the island of [[Evermeet]], where they were hunted by [[gold elves]].\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], rabbits could be found on the planets [[Chandos]] and [[Garden]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], rabbits could be found in the woods of [[Barovia]].",
