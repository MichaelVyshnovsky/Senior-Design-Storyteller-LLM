'''Lythlyx''' ({{SingPl}}), also known as '''spirals''', were bizarre [[psionic]] [[eel]]-like monsters that resembled corkscrews. Whether in the air or in water, they were constantly spinning.

==Description==
The rubbery and oily creatures were mottled black and green, with numerous mouths along their length. They spun constantly in midair, sometimes as fast as fifty revolutions per minute.

==Behavior==
Though intelligent, they remained uncommunicative and extremely unpredictable, sometimes passing up easy prey for larger groups or larger and more dangerous creatures. One thing remained constant whether in the water or in air: they did not touch the ground by choice, and thrashed violently if made to touch it. They did not use their psionic powers unless another originator of such powers acted near them, or they became dangerously wounded.

Lythlyx usually danced in place for years at a time, being found in remote areas. They seemed to favor cairns atop hills, rocky islets, and secluded pools in forested areas. Those that were found alone were always the strongest specimens, but otherwise they were found in groups of up to eighteen.

==Abilities==
So long as they remained spinning, lythlyx were not just mobile, but extremely agile, being able to turn pretty much at will. If they were ever stopped from spinning, they dropped to the ground; their great air resistance minimized damage from the fall, however.

The creatures seemed unaffected by pressure extremes, whether in deep trenches or in the stratosphere. Lacking eyes, they saw out of several similar structures along their bodies.

They possessed extensive psionic abilities, being known to use the [[psychokinetic]] science of ''[[create object]]'', and the devotions of ''[[animate object]]'', ''[[control flame]]'', ''[[control sound]]'', ''[[create sound]]'', and ''[[molecular agitation]]''. They were known to sport the [[psychometabolism]] devotions of ''[[body equilibrium]]'' and ''[[suspend animation]]''. Though uncommunicative, they had a wide suite of [[telepathic]] powers, including the ''[[psychic crush]]'' science, and the devotions of ''[[id insinuation]]'', ''[[mind thrust]]'', ''[[psionic blast]]'', and ''[[telepathic projection]]''. Finally, and of more note, their [[psychoportation]] abilities included the sciences of ''[[summon planar creature]]'' and ''[[teleport]]'', alongside the ''[[teleport trigger]]'' devotion; those could carry them from danger if severely wounded.

==Combat==

Those the creature attacked, apparently at random, were seized by mouth-like structures along its length that drained blood. The creature was extremely voracious and could process that blood to heal itself within two minutes, at which point it was hungry again. Its avidity for blood was such that they often exploded from the sheer volume of blood they had absorbed if struck down during feeding. It could also use its body as a whip or to constrict. It was also possessed of some psychic power, displaying immunities to spells such as ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[command]]'', and ''[[fear]]''.

They fled more powerful foes, but fought to the death when cornered.

==Ecology==
Lythlyx absorbed sunlight and moisture through their bodies, doing without blood for long stretches. They appeared to be hermaphroditic,"Bisexual" in the text; this is an older usage of the term. giving live birth to young that swarmed with the parent until fully grown. They were believed to live for centuries; some sages hypothesized they were part of the life cycle of the [[couatl]] or certain [[dragon]]s, while others believed them to be a stage in the life cycle of other tentacled monsters such as [[tentamort]]s, [[gibbering mouther]]s, or [[roper]]s. Their oily flesh was eaten only as a last resort by their predators.

Their body [[oil]] was used in the manufacture of several magical [[ink]]s and oils.

==History==
By the {{Yearlink|1368}}, lythlyx were known to wander [[Myth Drannor]]. One may have been at [[Sixstar]], ready to meet the heroes seeking ''[[the Arm of Valor (item)|the Arm of Valor]]''.

Mysteriously, some of those creatures served [[Labelas Enoreth]].{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|118}}
