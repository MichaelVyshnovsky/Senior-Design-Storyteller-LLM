        "Description": "The bodies of bombardier beetles generally grew to be around {{SIrange|4|6|ft|long=yes}} in length.",
        "Combat": "As a defense mechanism, bombardier beetles were able to expel clouds of reddish [[acid]]ic vapor from their abdomens that had a horrible smell. The sound of them expelling this acid could be deafening, potentially stunning nearby creatures. They could also emit a cloud of [[fire]] to protect themselves, a few times per day.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Unlike many beetles, bombardier beetles were solely carnivores, feeding mostly on carrion and gathering carcasses as places to lay their eggs.",
            "Habitats": "Bombardier beetles were typically found to dwell above-ground in forests of warm climate regions.\n\nIn [[north Faerûn]] they were known to inhabit parts of [[Cormanthor]]'s forests and the [[Dragon's Eye]] in the [[Spine of the World]]. In [[south Faerûn]] they could be found in the [[Forest of Amtar]] and the [[Lluirwood]], as well as the [[Mere of Dead Men]].\n\nOn the [[Chultan Peninsula]], giant bombardiers were a common sight in the jungles of the nation of [[Samarach]].\n\nBeyond Toril, they could be found on the planet of [[Krynn]].",
            "Usage": "The substances inside bombardier beetles could be harvested from dead specimens and used create small explosives."
        },
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Chang Emporium]] shipped bombardier beetles alongside [[fire beetle|fire]] and [[tangler beetle]]s on the [[caravel]] [[Dragonfly (caravel)|''Dragonfly'']] to the city of [[New Velar]], intending to have them sold by [[Lin-Woh]] as guardian animals. However, once there an offloading accident occured, leading cages to crash to the ground and unleash many of the beetles trapped within them.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Prospect|5-6}}"
