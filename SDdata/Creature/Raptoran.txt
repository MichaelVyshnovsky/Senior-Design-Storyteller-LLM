'''Raptorans''' were a freedom-loving race of humanoid avians.

==Description==
Raptorans were slightly taller than [[human]]s with longer arms and legs, although they tended to be slightly thinner. Most raptorans had white feathers that would turn darker on the tips as they aged. Their facial features tended to be angular and hawk-like.

==Society==
A typical raptoran flock had between forty to eighty members. Each flock was governed by a chief. A high chieftain ruled over several hundred flocks. Raptoran flocks usually built their communities into the side of a cliff or some other place that was difficult for other creatures to reach. Raptorans did not raise animals for food but were accomplished hunters of game.

==Religion==
The raptoran religion was largely nature-based, and each of the six deities of the [[raptoran pantheon]] were connected to the natural world. Raptorans also treated the moon and other heavenly bodies with great reverence. Clerics and druids chared the responsibility of spiritually guided the flocks.

The creator deity of the raptorans and the one to whom they all payed homage was [[Tuilviel Glithien]], the Queen of Air and Night, patron of the hunt and the family.

==History==
Ages ago, the raptorans made a pact with the lords of the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], which gave the raptorans the ability to fly in exchange for their pledge to send warriors to fight for the lords.

==Abilities==
At a young age, all raptorans went through a ritual called the '''Walk of the Four Winds''' that determined their fitness to fly. Those that passed the test gained the ability to fly. As raptorans grew older and stronger, they were capable of flying for longer periods of time. Adult raptorans were capable of actively flying for about 10 minutes at a time although they could glide for longer time periods.

==Lands==
Rarely seen in the Realms, raptorans were thought to have lived in cities carved out of the high cliffs of the [[Yehimal Mountains]].

==Notable Raptorans==
* [[Aundra Blacklock]]
