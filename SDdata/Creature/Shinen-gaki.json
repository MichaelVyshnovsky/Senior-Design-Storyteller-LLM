        "Description": "Shinen-gaki, unlike other gaki, was not humanoid. Rather, they were small floating balls of flame. The flame was either blue, red, white or yellow. They had a dark circular area near the middle of its body that acted as the eyes. Shinen-gaki were able to form tendrils of flame that were {{SI|5|ft}} in length.",
        "Biology": "Like all gaki, shinen-gaki were the reincarnated spirits of wicked people, in this case soldiers. Soldiers who committed treason or an act of cowardice were at risk of becoming shinen-gaki.",
        "Combat": "Shinen-gaki used fire to trap a target. They exploited a humans natural curiosity, who were lured to the spirit to by its light. It then created a circle of fire around its victim with its tendrils.",
        "Abilities": "Like all gaki, shinen-gaki had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[become invisible]]'' and ''[[polymorph]]'' spells at will, and ''[[passwall]]'' three times daily. They were immune to all charm, fire, hold and sleep spells, as well as ''[[drowsy insects]]''. They were vulnerable to any spell that affected spirits and water-based spells. Shinen-Gaki were able to fly and slowly regenerated damage that was inflicted upon them.",
