A '''uropygus''', also known as a '''giant whip scorpion''', '''giant pedipalp''', '''monstrous uropygid''', or occasionally '''giant vinegaroon''', was a very rare and dangerous creature, mainly found in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
Uroypgi were the largest type of [[pedipalpi]]. They had spiny bone-armored pincers and feelers like the smaller types, but also had tails which resembled the stinger of a scorpion. It was sometimes called a giant vinegaroon due to its acidic spray.

==Combat==
Uropygi fought with their two pincers and vicious bite. They could execute a gripping attack, and if the opponent could not escape it, they crushed and held in place for a series of bites.

As well as using their appendages, these creatures were also able to release [[poison]] gas thrice a day. The yellow, sultry and acrid gas would expand around a 20' radius sphere and those within would uncontrollably spasm and tremor.
