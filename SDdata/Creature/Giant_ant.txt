}}'''Giant ants''', also called '''zuka ants''' in [[Kukalatu language]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]], were a type of ant, but much bigger. There were several types, '''workers''', '''warriors''', '''soldiers''', '''drones''', and the '''queen'''.

==Abilities==
Much like regular ants, giant ants communicated through the use of complex pheromones. These pheromones were also highly acidic and were known to be used offensively by giant ants.

==History==
In the [[883 DR]], chaotic magic emanating from [[Hellgate Keep]] drove a colony of giant ants to burrow beneath the [[Grandfather Tree]] and the [[Halls of Mists]]. By [[1370 DR]] this colony was still known to be inhabiting the Hall of Mists, having created an extensive network of tunnels.

==Ecology==
Giant ants lived together in hives consisting of hundreds of members, most of whom were of the worker variety. Workers maintained the nest, while warriors fended off intruders. Warriors also acted as explorers and guardians of workers and went traveling beyond the confines of their nests. By contrast, giant ant soldiers almost always remained within their nest, unless ordered by their queen.

Their social organization was said to rival that of most [[humanoid]]s.
===Habitats===
[[File:Giant ant 2e.png|thumb|''A group of giant ants swarming a [[boots|boot]].'']]
Giant ants were known to live in the [[Bandit Wastes]] of [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]]. They dug a warren of tunnels beneath the barrens. In [[north Faerûn]], they could be found in the heavy forests of [[Cormanthor]].

A colony of ants inhabited the Hall of Mists in [[High Forest]]. Due to long-term exposure to the magic within the hall their physiology was altered, granting them regenerative and phasing abilities comparable to a [[phase spider]].

Beyond [[Faerûn]], giant ants could be found in parts of [[Kara-Tur]]. In the [[Zakhara]] region's [[Crowded Sea]], giant ants could be found on the island chain of [[Nada al-Hazan]] and the archipelago of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], giant ants could be found in the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] and in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].<ref>

===Relationships===
They often competed with [[ankheg]]s for territory. If they ever killed or drove away the adults of an ankheg nest, the broodlings left behind would be made to serve the giant ant colony.

Though difficult to tame and separate from their hive, some people were known to use giant ant workers as pack animals and soldier ants as fearless combat mounts. ''[[Queen pheromone admixture]]'', a [[potion]] developed by [[alchemist]]s, would help ease the process of capturing and taming a giant ant by making the drinker smell like a queen.
