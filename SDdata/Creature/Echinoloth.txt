'''Echinoloths''' were bizarre [[yugoloth]] amalgamations of [[squid]]s and [[starfish]] that served as the rear echelons of the daemon armies, where they mopped up—or in other words, devoured—remaining soldiers on the battlefield.

==Description==
Echinoloths were horrific creatures, the cross between squid and starfish creating an unwholesome whole. They had hunched, spherical bodies with four squirming, hook-covered tentacles, and a gaping maw at the center, though they lacked eyes.

==Behavior/Combat==
Echinoloths were single-minded in pursuit of their targets, not realizing the untenability of their outside circumstance and stopping at nothing to reach their foes. They enjoyed tearing enemies apart with their tentacles, and once they ripped into them and started devouring them they completely stopped paying attention to their surroundings, with only attack distracting them from their meal.

==Abilities==
Once an echinoloth started tearing into the flesh of their foes, the hooks on their tentacles caused persistent, unnatural wounds. The injuries resisted [[cure wounds|curing]] and [[heal]]ing magic, wouldn't heal by themselves, and outside of magical means, would require expert medicinal care to treat.

A nauseating aura surrounded echinoloths, causing those within {{SI|30|ft}} of them to experience gastral distress. Once per day, they could attempt to summon another echinoloth with a 40% chance of success.

==Society==
Echinoloths were typically alone, in clusters of 3-5, or "tangles" of 7-12. They followed the leading yugoloths of an army into battle, usually attacking enemies already being fought and flanking them.

==Ecology==
Though they lacked eyes, echinoloths could pinpoint the location of anything in contact with the ground or water surrounding them within {{SI|60|ft}} using the highly vibration sensitive hooks and tendrils on their bodies. Despite being able to breathe underwater, echinoloths were not swimmers, and moved by striding across the ocean floor. They were, however, skillful climbers, able to scale cliff sides with ease and survive on land indefinitely.
