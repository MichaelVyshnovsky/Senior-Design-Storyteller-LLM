Ogrillons ( ) were the result of orcs and ogres breeding.
Ogrillons looked very similar to orcs. Roughly 10% of ogrillons inherited the physical attributes of their ogre parentage and were clearly distinguishable from other orcs.
Ogrillons lived in tribes. They often cooperated with orcs and were regularly used by orc groups as extra muscle.
Despite little use for currency, ogrillons often considered gold coins lucky and most ogrillons carried coins with them.
Although most ogrillons pursued barbarian or fighter roles, some chose to become shamans.
Ogrillons thrived in combat and were uncomfortable and restless if not in a battle.
Ogrillons were carnivorous.
As of 1370 DR, ogrillons were one of the many creatures used as slaves in Menzoberranzan. At some point, the second house of Menzoberranzan (House Barrison DelArmgo) owned roughly 250 slave ogrillons.
