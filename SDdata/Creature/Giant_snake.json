        "mainbody": "A '''giant snake''' was a larger and much more powerful version of an ordinary [[snake]].",
        "Description": "As the name suggested, these creatures were the giant versions of snakes. They were identical in all but size and predatory habits (as their larger size allowed for them to tackle larger and more powerful prey). Unlike some other altered forms of animals, giant snakes only possessed animal-like intelligence.\n\nDue to the large variety in giant snake species, they were usually described by their individual types: [[amphisbaena]], [[giant constrictor snake|constrictor]], [[giant poisonous snake|poisonous]], [[sea snake|sea]], and [[giant spitting snake|spitting]]. These species had different sizes, habits, and methods of attack.",
        "Behavior": "All types of giant snake were carnivorous. They were deadly predators, and often sought out other giant animals, such as [[giant frog]]s.",
        "Combat": "Giant snakes either attacked by utilizing their natural [[poison]]s or constricting their prey.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "These giant serpents could survive in all but the coldest climates.{{Cite adventurers league/Beneath the Fetid Chelimber}}{{Cite adventurers league/To Find A Way Out}} [[Kara-Tur]], and [[Zakhara]].{{Cite dungeon/57/The Rose Of Jumlat}} The [[Forest of Amtar]] in [[Dambrath]] was full of reptiles, such as giant snakes.",
            "Usages": "[[Priest]]s of [[Sseth]] were known to construct special [[shield]]s by treating the shed skin of giant snakes and wrapping them around a core of [[ironwood]].\n\n[[File:GiantSeaSnake.png|500px|''A [[giant sea snake]] wraps itself around a boat.'']]"
        },
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], many settlements along the [[Tumen River]] in [[Koryo]] were destroyed by such creatures.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], [[Zasian Menz]] and [[Kaanyr Vhok]] used a portal that connected a giant snake to the stomach of a [[storm dragon]]. This allowed them to be transported to [[Celestia]] from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]."
