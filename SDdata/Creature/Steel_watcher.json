        "mainbody": "'''Steel watchers''' were a type of [[construct]] found in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], that served Lord [[Enver Gortash]], the [[chosen]] of [[Bane]] and aspiring Archduke of the city. They were considered by their creators to be a perversion of [[Gondian]] ideals, created using technology that was both divine and otherworldly in origin.\n\n{{Quote|Any threat to the Steel Watch is a threat to Lord Gortash himself.|A steel watcher automaton.}}",
        "Description": "Steel watchers resembled large, gilded suits of armor that had come to life. Their steel metallic bodies were decorated with elaborate ornamentation and [[gold]] filigree. Their upper legs were adorned with relief busts of vigilant soldiers, and the helms that formed their heads were topped with a [[griffon]]-like sculpture and red plume.\n\nAs the engine within steel watchers ran, the individual plates that formed its metallic shell vibrated against each other.\n\nThey were created at least in part from [[infernal iron]], a metal that originated from the [[Nine Hells]]. Older models of the steel watchers featured \"ra-gnax casements\" that housed their engines' \"metallurgised-ised valves\".",
        "Behavior": "Steel watchers followed set parameters for their activities, mostly set to patrol the city or stand guard over set areas.",
        "Abilities": "Despite their inorganic nature, steel watchers were exceptionally agile. They moved swiftly on the battlefield and could readily dodge many attacks sent their way. The constructs' legs were spring-loaded, enabling them to leap great distances.\n\nWhenever they were damaged to the point of near destruction, steel sentinels would enter into self-destruct protocol. Once they were rendered completely non-functionable, they would detonate in a massive explosion.",
        "Combat": "Steel watchers were equipped with specialized ''[[steelwatcher helmet]]s'' with gyronetic and targeting modules, ''[[watcher greatsword]]s'', and large-scale, non-[[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[heavy crossbow]]s.\n\nSteel watchers were exceptionally resilient. They could resist all manner of physical harm, [[magic]] spells and [[polymorph]]ic effects, and were entirely immune to [[poison]] and all types of [[psionic]] attacks. They were however vulnerable to lightning and electrical discharges.\n\nThey possessed a form of artificial hyper awareness and could not be surprised by assailants.",
        "Ecology": "Once destroyed, the head of a steel watcher could be removed and [[steelwatcher helmet|worn as a helmet]].\n\nWith the right [[watcher crossbow|blueprints]], an individual could use a steel watcher arm and one of their [[targeting module]]s to create an especially powerful ''[[Hellfire engine crossbow|ranged weapon]]''.",
        "History": "[[File:Steel parade bg3.png|thumb|right|300px|''The steel watch is being welcomed in Baldur's Gate.'']]\n{{Quote|The Banites collared us like dogs, locked our families away - promised us freedom if we followed their every command. But it was a lie.|[[Zanner Toobin]].}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Banite]] cultists loyal to Lord Enver Gortash imprisoned the families of Baldurian [[Gondian]]s within the submerged [[Iron Throne headquarters|Iron Throne prison]], found beneath [[Gray Harbor]]. He used their plight as leverage to force a few of their numbers―[[Lowa]], [[Droo Falbo]], and [[Zanner Toobin]], among others―to create the army of steel watchers and maintain their operation throughout the city.\n\nOriginally, the '''Auto-Guards''', as they were formerly known, were designed to have a small cockpit in the torso for individual piloting. However, after seizing the Dock Foundry through the fraud and blackmail of the Gondian families, Gortash radically changed these plans. He announced that the Steel Watch would be entirely remote-controlled from a central hub—unbeknownst to the Gondians, this would involve the use of Myrkulyte necromancy and illithid psionics.\n\nHaving thrown Baldur's Gate and the surrounding lands into chaos―by sowing chaos with the [[cult of the Absolute]] and spreading thin the forces of the [[Flaming Fist]]―Lord Gortash \"offered\" the Steel Watch in service of the city, as he prepared to install himself as the first archduke of Baldur's Gate.",
        "Creation": "[[File:Neurocitor.png|thumb|right|300px|''The neurocitor, the device that granted control over each and every Steel Watch automaton.'']]\n{{Quote|There are no problems with the mechanisms, the hybrid Gondian/illithed devices work flawlessly. But at night...brains begin to whisper psionically, their whispers join and harmonise, and then THE BRAINS SING. And it's a song of such unutterable sadness, such deadly melancholy...|Excerpts of a note written by a unknown Gondian.}}\n\nThe steel watchers were created by combining Gondian knowledge of automation and gyronotics, and twisted [[illithid]] [[psionic]] technology. The horrific control system involved a series of [[humanoid]] brains―one each for every steel watcher―preserved within glass [[jar]]s full of cerebral fluid. These brains, sourced from zombies that had been decapitated and had their brains removed and 'tadpoled', became part of the [[The Absolute|Absolute]] hive mind. Each tadpoled brain, while sealed in its jar, retained a psionic connection to its undead, headless body, which was then integrated into the torso of a steel watcher. These components were bound together with a single neural switchboard known as the ''[[neurocitor]]'' which coordinated the telepathic traffic. The horrific device was found in the heart of the [[Steel Watch foundry]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "A prototype of the ''[[hellfire engine]]'' used to power steel watchers was implanted in the chest of the [[tiefling]] mercenary [[Karlach Cliffgate]], before she was sold to [[archdevil]] [[Zariel]] to be used as her own personal [[demon]]-slayer.",
        "Notable Steel Watchers": "* [[Steel Watch titan]], a quadruped steel watcher that guarded the [[Steel Watch foundry]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]."
