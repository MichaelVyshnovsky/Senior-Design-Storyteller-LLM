        "Description": {
            "Equipment": "Trumpet archons were often observed wearing metal collars about their necks and breastplates over their chests. As with other archons, these ornaments were not actual metal; they were mystical representations of the archon's rank within the hierarchy of Celestia and could not be removed.\n[[File:Trumpet archon 2eB.png|thumb|left|''A trumpet archon with his breastpate.'']]\nEach trumpet archon carried a gleaming [[silver]] [[trumpet]] about six feet (two meters) long. This trumpet could transform into a silver, magical [[greatsword]] at the whim of its bearer. These were granted as gifts from the powers, and each archon was only granted one such trumpet during its time as a trumpet archon. The trumpets morphed into useless chunks of lead if stolen.\n\nWhen sounded, the trumpets produced music of piercing, beautiful clarity. If the archon desired, the sound could be enchanted to install paralyzing awe in any hearers."
        },
        "Abilities": "Their wings allowed trumpet archons to fly, though, like all archons, they could also [[Teleport without error|teleport]] anywhere that they desired without a chance of failure.\n\nLike all archons, trumpet archons could speak and understand any language they desired and even send a [[message]] in any language over short distances. Trumpet archons could [[Detect evil|detect the presence of evil]] and also [[Magic circle against evil|protect themselves from it]]. They could create a source of [[continual flame]] whenever they desired.\n\nTrumpet archons were immune to paralyzation and electricity. They were resistant to magic and could not be affected by mundane weapons or even low-powered magical ones. They could [[darkvision|see in darkness]] and dim light. Trumpets were even more intelligent than [[sword archon]]s.",
        "Combat": "Trumpet archons were skilled combatants, though&mdash;like all archons&mdash;they hated having to fight. When forced, they preferred to rely on their magic first. Trumpet archons cast powerful [[divine magic]] spells and could access two of the domains of their deity, just as clerics could. Commonly, these domains included [[Air domain|air]], [[Destruction domain|destruction]], [[Good domain|good]], [[Law domain|law]], and [[War domain|war]].\n\nIf a battle was going to be a long one, they would blow their powerful trumpets first to paralyze their foes and then attack with their full wrath. When engaged in battle, they produced a menacing aura of righteousness that negatively affected their foes' ability to fight back.\n\nTrumpet archons could fight with other weapons than their trumpet-swords, but they rarely ever did. Trumpets never bore shields or wore any armor beyond their mystical breastplates.",
        "Society": {
            "Promotion": "Trumpet archons were specially chosen and created for their tasks,\nby the promotion of willing sword archons who had obtained platinum accoutrements. Such an offer of promotion generally only came once, and it was exceptionally rare for a sword to pass up the opportunity. However, the risk was great, as trumpet archons who died on a journey to the Prime risked oblivion.\n\nAs the trumpet archon progressed along a path of goodness, the metal of its collar and breastplate appeared to change from lead to tin to brass to bronze to silver to gold and at last to platinum. When a trumpet archon wearing platinum fittings was promoted, it was transformed into a [[throne archon]] wearing lead.\n\nAlternatively, because of the extreme risks taken on by trumpet archons, a good number of trumpets were instead promoted to [[aasimon]]&mdash;either [[agathinon]] or [[light aasimon]]&mdash;after only a few such dangerous missions."
        },
        "Ecology": "Trumpet archons had a strange diet in that the only thing that they consumed was [[mead]]&mdash;and mead particularly made from the [[honey]] of the flowering plants of Mount Celestia.",
        "Notable Trumpet Archons": "* [[Alusiel]], a fallen trumpet archon who ruled the city of [[Mal Arundak]] on [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 403: The Rainless Waste|Layer 403]] of the [[Abyss]].\n* [[Oshiga]], a messenger of the [[celestial paragon]] [[Erathaol]]."
