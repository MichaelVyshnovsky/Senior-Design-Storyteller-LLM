        "mainbody": "'''Killer whales''', also known as '''orcas''', were relatively small [[whale]]s that were vicious marine predators.",
        "Description": "Despite their relatively small sizes compared to other whales, killer whales were among the largest sea predatory mammals.\n\nKiller whales used their echolocation by emitting high-pitched sound to detect objects and other creatures. This ability did not work if the whale's hearing were to be impaired or if its detecting area was under the effect of a ''[[silence]]'' spell.",
        "Behavior": "Orcas were vicious predators that attacked anything within their range of detection. However, they were not excessively hostile, usually only attacking when hungry or provoked.\n\nThey were also intelligent animals that could be communicated with.\n\n[[File:Sahuagin versus Orca.png|thumb|338x338px|A killer whale fights off a group of blood frenzied [[sahuagin]]]]",
        "Combat": "The main weapons killer whales used in combat were their powerful bites, which they could use to hold down their prey until it drowned.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Killer whales were typically known to hunt fish and squids, as well as several kinds of warm-blooded animals, including [[seal]]s, other [[whale]]s,{{Cite dragon/116/By Tooth and Claw|64}} They were resourceful hunters that employed sophisticated hunting strategies such as breaking ice sheets to knock their occupants into freezing cold water. A pod of killer whales was capable of collaborating to bring down much larger prey.",
            "Habitats": "One of the bodies of water that they were most often encountered in was the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. They were also known to be found in waters around [[the North]].\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], orcas were commonly found in the temperate latitudes of the planet [[Karpri]]. Whales native to that planet were unusually calm and graceful, a trait which caused them to be heavily hunted by outsiders."

        "Notable Killer Whales": "* The [[storm giant]] princesses [[Nym (storm giant)|Nym]], [[Serissa]], and [[Mirran]] each had a killer whale pet. Nym used hers, an enormous specimen, as her mount."
