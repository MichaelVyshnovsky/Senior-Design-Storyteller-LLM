Skull fliers were animated, flying skulls with a long stinger.
Skull fliers were highly mobile because of their flying speed. They attacked with their poisonous stinger.
The sea hag coven (Nana Pocktuss, Auntie Unk and Granny Muyuk) in the Thunder Cliff Caves animated the skulls of dead sailors as skull fliers to protect their lair.
