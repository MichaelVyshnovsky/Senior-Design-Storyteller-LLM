'''Skull fliers''' were animated, flying skulls with a long stinger.

==Combat==
Skull fliers were highly mobile because of their flying speed. They attacked with their poisonous stinger.

==Notable skull fliers==
The [[sea hag]] coven ([[Nana Pocktuss]], [[Auntie Unk]] and [[Granny Muyuk]]) in the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]] animated the skulls of dead sailors as skull fliers to protect their lair.
