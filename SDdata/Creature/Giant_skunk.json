        "mainbody": "'''Giant skunks''' were an extra-large variety of their [[skunk|smaller cousins]].",
        "Biology": "Giant skunks were capable of secreting a [[musk]] from a small posterior sac, which was heavily muscled in order to permit expulsion of the liquid. Once expelled, this fluid formed a heavy, noxious mist. This mist not only temporarily poisoned and blinded their victims, but left a lingering terrible stench. Giant skunks were immune to the nausea effect of this musk, but would still suffer blindness.\n\nThe stench of their musk was difficult to remove, requiring several days of washing and airing out. However, the spray would cause items made of cloth to rot away, even those of a [[magical item|magical]] nature.\n\nThe spray of glacier skunks was notably strong enough to immobilize a grown man, causing a stinging sensation in the eyes and a burning sensation in the throat. In some cases, it was even known to cause victims to cough up blood.",
        "Combat": "Much like their smaller cousins, when threatened a giant skunk would spray a cloud of vile musk at its opponents.",
        "Sub-Species": "* '''Glacier skunk''': a species of giant skunk that was endemic to the [[Ice Spires]] region. They were said to be as large as [[wolves]], with claws comparable to those of [[bear]]s, and had a needle-like barb protruding from the end of their furry tails. Glacier skunks were known to be strong and fierce enough to take down a full-grown male [[elk]] in the same way a [[mountain lion]] could.",
        "History": "[[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]] of [[Lyndusfarne]] was capable of shapeshifting into a glacier skunk and was disguised as such on the day that [[Tavis Burdun]] first met him.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Giant skunks were omnivorous scavengers, willing to eat almost anything. Typically they ate the remains of creatures killed by larger predators. They were occasionally known to raid the camps of sentient creatures, such as [[human]]s, in search of food.",
            "Habitats": "Giant skunks typically lived in forested areas. and the [[Plain of Standing Stones]]. However, glacier skunks were known to live in mountainous terrain and were rarely found anywhere else.\n\nA number of giant skunks were known to serve the mad [[druid]] [[Wyllow]] within [[Wyllowwood|her domain]] of [[Undermountain]].",
            "Relations": "Skunks were occasionally known to be domesticated.",
            "Usages": "A dead skunk with an intact posterior sac of musk was worth around 200 [[gold piece]]s to many sages and alchemists, as their musk was a very versatile component. They could be used to create smoke bombs and scrolls of ''[[stinking cloud]]''. Beyond their musk, the meat and pelts of giant skunks were considered relatively worthless. Their flesh was bitter and required heavy seasoning to make palatable.\n\nThe scent glands of several giant skunks could be mixed with the blood of a [[green dragon]] in a broth to [[item enchantment|enchant]] its [[dragon's tooth|tooth]]."
