An '''ineffable horror''' was a large and terrifying [[aberration]] that prowled the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
Ineffable horrors body resembled that of an [[ogre]], with a head that looked like that of a [[mind flayer]]. Growing from its back was a pair of large, bat-like wings. A physical feature unique to ineffable horrors was that its intestinal track was external, appearing as a writhing mass where its abdomen would normally be.
==Combat==
Ineffable horrors hunted in groups called murders. They used their size and strength to drag a victim within reach of their intestines, which wrapped themselves around the unfortunate target.
==Ecology==
Ineffable horrors fed on the blood of their victims. When a target was wrapped in their intestines, their blood was rapidly drained.
