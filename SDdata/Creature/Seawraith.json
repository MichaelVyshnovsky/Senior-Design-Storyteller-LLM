        "History": "Sometime in the days that followed the [[Spellplague]], seawraiths menaced the city of [[Waterdeep]]. They emerged from the [[Sea of Swords]] to attack ships in the harbors of the City of Splendors and usually driven back into the sea by the agents of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]."
