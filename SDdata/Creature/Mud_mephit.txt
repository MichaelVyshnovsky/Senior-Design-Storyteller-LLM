Mud mephits were mephits composed of water and earth. They were slow, greedy and falsely polite, constantly complaining and seeking attention.
Mud mephit wings were an alchemical ingredient. When the wings of clay and mud were harvested, they quickly detrained and fell apart. These wings could be processed into a suspension of muddy goo, that, in turn, when mixed with a certain alchemical sublimate to create an elixir of poison resistance.
