The '''island pony''' was a type of [[pony]] that was native to the islands of the [[Trackless Sea]]. They were commonly kept by the [[Illuskan]] people and, despite the islanders' lack of horsemanship, served them well throughout the development of their civilization.

==Description==
These equines were rather large and muscular for a breed of pony. They had broad barrel-chests and resilient hooves that typically did not need to be shoed.

Island ponies were hearty, sure-footed steeds.
