Worghests were planetouched, native outsiders descended from the breeding of goblins and barghests.
Worghests often lived as feared and respected warriors in orc and goblin tribes, disdaining positions of power in favor of the freedom of the hunt.
Worghests descended from barghests and goblins, so they had barghest features, including glowing orange eyes and blue hair.
Worghests shared the ability to consume other humanoids with their barghest ancestors. They also had the limited ability to shape-change into a wolf.
