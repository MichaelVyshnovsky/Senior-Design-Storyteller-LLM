        "mainbody": "Frost lizards were aggressive magical lizards that were a threat for caravans traveling through Icewind Dale and Spine of the World.\nFrost lizards where small  white creatures that could glide on snow and ice. Their scales coloring made them almost invisible in snow as long as they remained still.\nFrost lizards laid hidden in the snow using their natural camouflage until they spotted their prey. They glided into attack using their breath weaponâ€” spitting out ice balls at a  range. When they approached close enough to the prey, they swiped at it with their sharp claws.\nFrost lizards were aggressive hunters. They especially had a taste for the horses and oxen of the caravaneers moving through the lizards hunting grounds."
