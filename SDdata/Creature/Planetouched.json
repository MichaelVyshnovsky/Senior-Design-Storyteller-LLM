        "mainbody": "'''Planetouched''' was a general term used to described mortal creatures whose lineages traced back to an [[outsider]] of some kind, causing them some unusual characteristics that persisted in the bloodline for several generations. Planetouched were not as dramatically different as a true hybrid (i.e. a half-celestial or half-fiend) would be. The most common types of planetouched were tieflings and aasimar. However, there were no \"typical\" planetouched, as the different types generally lacked cultures of their own and instead adopted the culture they were born into.\n\nThere were many different types of Planetouched:\n\n* [[Aasimar]] were descended from [[celestial]]s.\n* [[Axani]] were descended from lawful outsiders.{{Cite dragon/297/Children of the Cosmos|63-64}}\n* [[Azerblood]] were descended from [[Shield dwarf|shield dwarves]] and [[azer]]s.{{Cite dragon/350/Legacies of Ancient Empires: Planetouched of Faerûn|52}}\n* [[Cansin]] were descended from chaotic outsiders.\n* [[Celadrin]] were descended from [[Elf|elves]] and [[celestial eladrin]].\n* [[Chaond]]s were descended from [[slaad]]i.\n* [[D'hin'ni]] were descended from [[lightfoot halfling]]s and [[djinn]].\n* [[Genasi]] and [[para-genasi]] were descended from elemental creatures, usually [[genie]]s.\n* [[Gloaming]]s were descended from inhabitants of the Plane of Shadow.\n* [[Mechanatrix]]es were descended from the clockwork beings that resided in Mechanus.\n* [[Shadowswyft]]s were descended from creatures from the [[Plane of Shadow]].<ref>\n* [[Shyft]]s were descended from beings from the [[Ethereal Plane]].\n* [[Zenythri]]s were descended from an unknown race of lawful outsiders.[[File:MonFaePG73.jpg|thumb|A tanarukk (left) and a fey'ri (right).]]\n* Part-fiends were among the most common planetouched, with many different types deriving from specific mortal, and in some cases fiendish, races.\n**[[Tiefling]]s were perhaps the most common and well-known planetouched, descending from the mixing of humans and fiends.\n**[[Baphitaur|Baphitaurs]] were a combination of [[human]], [[minotaur]], [[ghour]], and [[goristro]] magically created by [[Netherese]] wizards.{{Cite dragon/350/Legacies of Ancient Empires: Planetouched of Faerûn|50}}\n**[[Draegloth]]s were the [[half-fiend]] offspring of [[drow]] and [[glabrezu]].\n**[[Durzagon]] were the [[half-fiend]] offspring of [[duergar]] and [[Devil|devils]].\n**[[Fey'ri]] were descended from [[Elf|elves]] and [[demon]]s.\n**[[Maeluth]] were descended from [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[devil]]s.\n**[[Mur-zhagul]] were descended from [[troll]]s and demons.\n**[[Tanarukk]] were descended from [[orc]]s and fiends.\n**[[Wispling]]s were descended from [[halfling]]s and demons.\n**[[Worghest]] were descended from [[goblin]]s and [[barghest]]s."
