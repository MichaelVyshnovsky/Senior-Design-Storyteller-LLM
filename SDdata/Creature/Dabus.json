        "Description": "Dabus were humanoids with white hair, goat-like horns, and yellow-tan skin. They floated inches above the ground, their feet never touching the earth.‎\n\nThe dabus spoke only through visual rebuses, with symbols that materialized and filled the air above their heads. They could understand spoken language, however.",
        "Society": "[[File:Dabus promo.jpg|thumb|''Example of dabus's speech.''|280x280px]]\nThe dabus reported to and followed to the letter the unspoken orders of the Lady of Pain. They were routinely found maintaining the city of Sigil, building walls, destroying buildings, paving streets, and maintaining ''[[portal]]s'' according to the Lady's wishes. Despite the dabus' patient nature, interrupting or standing in the way of their work was a risky affair that might land one in one of the Lady's mazes.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "There was a theory that dabus were shaped by the Lady of Pain from the [[phirblas]], an ancient race from the [[Ethereal plane]] with many similarities.<ref>‎",
