Shadow harts were a rare teleporting variant of a common deer.
These animals were visually similar to white stags but appeared to glow and were nearly translucent as well. It had larger hoof prints than more common deer. 
This deer variant was able to teleport short distances. It was also immune to mind-affecting spells.       
Shadow harts fought using their hooves and antlers. To escape mid-fight, they used their teleportation abilities.
The horns of these animals could be used to create cures for some illnesses. The heart could be used to craft a lesser amulet of health. 
These rare wild herbivores often traveled alone and used their teleportation abilities to quickly travel short distances even when not in danger.
In the , at least one shadow hart lived in the foothills connecting Hilltop and Blumberg. The hunter Ferran Valiantheart was looking to kill it to retrieve its horns to cure his wife from an unspecified disease. The deer either died or escaped based on the actions of Drogan Drogansons pupil, who either killed the deer, helped it, did not meet it, or avoided it altogether.
