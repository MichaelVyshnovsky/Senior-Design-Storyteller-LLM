'''Shadow harts''' were a rare ''[[teleport]]ing'' variant of a common [[deer]].

==Description==
These animals were visually similar to [[white stag]]s but appeared to glow and were nearly translucent as well. It had larger hoof prints than more common deer. 

==Abilities==
This deer variant was able to ''teleport'' short distances. It was also immune to mind-affecting [[spell]]s.       

==Combat==
Shadow harts fought using their hooves and antlers. To escape mid-fight, they used their teleportation abilities.

==Uses==
The horns of these animals could be used to create cures for some illnesses. The heart could be used to craft a ''[[lesser amulet of health]]''. 

==Ecology==
These rare wild herbivores often traveled alone and used their teleportation abilities to quickly travel short distances even when not in danger.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, at least one shadow hart lived in the foothills connecting [[Hilltop]] and [[Blumberg]]. The hunter [[Ferran Valiantheart]] was looking to kill it to retrieve its horns to cure his wife from an unspecified [[disease]]. The deer either died or escaped based on the actions of [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]], who either killed the deer, helped it, did not meet it, or avoided it altogether.
