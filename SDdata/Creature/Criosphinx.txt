Criosphinxes () were a type of ram-headed sphinx.
Like other types of sphinx, these creatures had tawny lion bodies as large as a horse with large wings similar to that of a falcon. In addition, they were always male.
Criosphinxes found wealth extremely attractive and would pursue it above all else if they couldnt find a gynosphinx. Because of their penchant for wealth, they enjoyed extorting tolls from travelers. They also had remarkable memories, at least in terms of remembering their treasure caches.
Unlike other types of sphinxes, these creatures did not possess an innate spellcasting ability. Because of this, they relied upon their leonine claws and ram-horns in combat, and would forgo using their teeth. When fighting, their combat tactics were rather simple.
Like most sphinxes, these creatures lived largely solitary lives. Though while searching for a mate, occasionally up to four of them could be found traveling together, each of them hoping to take her for themselves. Criosphinxes would bury their treasures in the ground as they traveled, often having several caches spread over a considerable area.
Whenever a criosphinx mated with a gynosphinx, male children born of their union would also be criosphinxes.
It was a common practice among members of this species to add a descriptive adjective to their name.
These creatures were a carnivorous species. They would use their sharp teeth to rip chunks of meat from their prey and then swallow them whole.
Criosphinxes were typically found in deserts
In Faer√ªn, they could be found in the Hullack Forest. In the Shining South they could be found in Dambrath, the Shaar, and the Toadsquat Mountains.
These creatures were capable of speaking Common, as well as the language of sphinxes and animals.
Criosphinxes were known to act as servants of the deity Nephthys.
Criosphinxes lusted after gynosphinxes and constantly sought them out, though the latter found them repulsive.
Around 1374 DR, one could find criosphinxes stabled by the Zhentarim as mounts within the Temple in the Sky.
