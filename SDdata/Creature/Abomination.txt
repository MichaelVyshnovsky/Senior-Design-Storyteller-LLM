'''Abominations''' were a loosely categorized group of creatures born of the gods but regarded as mistakes and consequently unwanted and imprisoned. Some were used as weapons during the [[Dawn War]].

==Description==
Abominations possessed a variety of horrid, misshapen forms.

===Types of Abominations===
* [[Anaxim]]s, ill-conceived mechanical creations of forge deities.
* [[Astral stalker]]
* [[Atropal]]s, the remnants of stillborn gods.
* [[Blood  fiend]]
* [[Chichimec]]s, the monstrous, many-winged offspring of deities of the sky and wind.
* [[Discord incarnate]]
* [[Dream larva]]e, misbegotten offspring of gods of dreams and longing; they were trapped in the regions of dreams and, as they lacked any form of their own, took the form of a dreamer's worst nightmare when viewed.
* [[Hecatoncheires]], or hundred-handed ones, were the oldest abominations; they were "born" before the form of living things was fully set.
* [[Infernal (creature)|Infernal]]s, the thankfully rare offspring born when a god was seduced by a fiend.
* [[Phaethon]], blobs of sentient, rage-filled magma born of fire gods, typically imprisoned in the core of a world.
* [[Phane]], shadowy creatures born of the gods of fate and time, normally trapped outside of it.
* [[Rotvine defiler]]
* [[Tarrasque]]
* [[Xixecal]], gargantuan creatures spawned of gods of ice and chaos, perpetually surrounded by eternal, devastating ice storms.

==Personality==
Abominations were hate-filled, self-loathing beings accursed of both heaven and hell. They took delight only in causing destruction and sought to destroy nothing less than all of creation.

==Abilities==
All abominations had certain abilities. They were immune to [[polymorph]], petrification, and other form-altering spells and effects; damage caused by energy or health drain; and anything that effected the mind, such as charms, compulsions, or phantasms. They were typically at least resistant to fire and cold, and were otherwise difficult to damage. Abominations resisted detection as if constantly under the ''[[nondetection]]'' spell. Each kind of abomination could also summon a specific kind of creature, one that was related to both its own abilities and those of its divine parent.

Abominations possessed [[blindsight]] with a range of {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} and [[truesight]]. They were known to speak the [[Celestial language|Celestial]], [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]], and [[Infernal language|Infernal]] languages, and typical an elemental language ([[Aquan]], [[Auran]], [[Ignan]], or [[Terran]]) depending on where they were imprisoned. They also could [[telepathy|telepathically]] communicate with creatures within {{SI|1000|ft|long=yes}} of theirself, as long as that creature also spoke a language.

Although abominations were sometimes worshiped as gods, they had no ability to grant spells to their followers.

==Ecology==
As the offspring of the gods, abominations each possessed a spark of deific power, making them virtually immortal, as they aged so slowly and needed to eat, sleep, and breathe so rarely that death came only when killed in combat. However, they were known to eat for the enjoyment of it, especially enjoying eating still-living creatures.

Abominations were imprisoned due to divine decrees, whether in a portion of a plane, a demiplane, or some location on the Material Plane. On the rare occasions they got free or were released, they caused only destruction.

==History==
Some abominations occasionally broke free from their imprisonment or were found and brought to the [[Prime Material plane]] and to [[Toril]] in particular. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[lich]] [[Acererak]] brought an atropal he had found in the [[Negative Energy plane]] to [[Chult]] and attempted to nourish it with [[Necromancy|necromantic]] energy by feeding it the souls of the Torilian dead.<ref>
