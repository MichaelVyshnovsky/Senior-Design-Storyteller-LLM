        },
        "Varieties": "Three unique species of seal lived on the Great Glacier:\n* [[Scoop seal]]s, which had [[shovel]]-like flippers used for burrowing in snow,\n* [[Chatter seal]]s, which mimicked voices, much like mockingbirds, and\n* [[Fanged seal]]s, which had especially sharp teeth.\nA number of seal species were also found in the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]].{{Cite web/Moonsea Fauna}}\n*[[Rocky shore seal]]s, inhabitants of the rocky shores that were common in the eastern portions of the Moonsea.\n*[[Sea bear]]s, large and aggressive predators, rarely found in the eastern Moonsea. Their population was dwindling around [[1371 DR]].\n*[[River Lis seal]]s, nocturnal spotted seals that made eerie sounds, common in the [[River Lis]].\n*[[Moonsea seal]]s, rarely hunted compared to other seals of the region, found throughout the entire Moonsea.\n*[[Sea hag (seal)|Sea hags]], enormous herbivorous seals that were thought to have gone extinct by [[1341 DR]].\n*[[Moonsea tusker]]s, enormous seals that fed on crustaceans, thought to have gone extinct before [[1071 DR]] due to overhunting.",
        "Notable Seals": "The [[human]] [[druid]] [[Mantiera]] spent much of her time in the shape of a seal.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|572|Mantiera}}"
