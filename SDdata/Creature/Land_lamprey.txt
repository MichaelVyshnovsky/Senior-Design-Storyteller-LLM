Land lampreys were a species of lamprey that had mutated to be capable of surviving on land.
Their bodies were fairly thick and heavy compared to ocean lampreys, with light to blackish green bodies measuring  in length.
Unlike sea lamprey, they could be compelled to let go of prey by exposing them to fire.
Land lampreys could breathe air and moved similarly to a snake.
Much like a leech and the more common sea lamprey, land lampreys used their mouths to fasten themselves to prey, from which they gradually  drained blood. Once full, they detached themselves from their prey, but otherwise they largely refused to let go unless killed.
In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, land lampreys were one of many creatures driven out of the Rat Hills by the Rat Hills Conflagration and into nearby Waterdeep.
They could be found in almost any environment, except for deserts or those with cold climates, but preferred those that were dark and damp. They typically made their lairs within small caves.
In north Faerûn they could be found in the northern regions of the Moonsea, around the ruins of Old Phlan, and in The Vast. 
In northwest Faerûn, they were known to inhabit the Rat Hills dump near Waterdeep. In west Faerûn, they could be found in the land of High Moor.
In Zakharas Crowded Sea, they could be found on the Djinnis Claws.
