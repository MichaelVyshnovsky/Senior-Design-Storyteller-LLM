        "mainbody": "A madcap was a redcap that soaked its hat in demon ichor rather than the customary blood. These fey exhibited a more extreme version of their more common counterparts temperament.\nRather than falling unconscious, when a madcap was damaged to the point of no longer being able to fight, it died in a burst of fire that rendered all but its boots and weapon into ash.\nThe Knucklebones Gang, an Avernian gang led by Mad Maggie, counted 30 madcaps among its members."
