A wereowl, also known as a wrowl, was a lycanthrope that could turn into an owl.
Wrowls took the form of human-sized snowy owls. At night, they would transform into these forms, which were highly intelligent, and even capable of speaking Common. They were agile in the air, and could perform aerial attacks.
When fighting, these shapechangers used both sets of claws and their beaks.
Wrowls treated harpies as their natural enemies.
Wereowls were the first known avian lycanthropes.
