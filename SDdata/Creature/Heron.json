        "mainbody": "Herons were a species of water-wading bird found in the Realms.\nTheir beaks had a similar shape to that of a boobrie.\nHerons were generally found in habitats typical of water wading birds. These included marshes, swamps, lake verges, and along the banks of watercourses.\nIn interior Faer√ªn, herons were quite common in the Farsea Marshes. In the Unapproachable East, they could be found in the nation of Aglarond in the Tannath Gap.\nSome swamp-based rangers kept herons as animal companions.\nIn the city of Ravens Bluff, herons were one of many birds that the Ravens Glory dining club would serve to its patrons."
