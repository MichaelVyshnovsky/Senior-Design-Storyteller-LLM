'''Bronze serpents''' were a type of large serpentine [[construct]].

==Description==
These serpentine constructs were made of articulated [[bronze]] rings. Their eyes glowed a bluish-white and their powerful jaws dripped with electrical sparks. They typically measured {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in length and weighed around {{SI|1000|lb|long=yes}}.

==Abilities==
Their bodies were immune to harm from electrical attacks, immune to [[spell]]s that affected the mind, and could see in [[darkvision|areas of total darkness]] out to a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. Furthermore, electrical attacks made on a bronze serpent would heal its body.

==Combat==
Bronze serpents typically concentrated initial attacks on those that appeared most vulnerable to their fangs. They attacked by grappling and constricting the bodies of their enemies, then biting with their electrical fangs.

==Ecology==
As constructs, they had little to no effect on their surrounding environment, and could be found in any land ecosystem.

===Creation===
Bronze serpents could be created from {{SI|1000|lb|long=yes}} of bronze by a caster of above-average skill who could cast [[arcane magic|arcane]] spells. The creation process also required use of the spells ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', and ''[[shocking grasp]]''.

==History==
These serpentine constructs were originally created in tropical lands to guard the temples of serpentine deities. Over the centuries the secrets of their creation spread, making it possible to see them almost anywhere in the Realms.

In [[1374 DR]], bronze serpents could be found among the many constructs that guarded the [[Arcturiadoom]] level of [[Undermountain]].
