        "mainbody": "iant cranes were a monstrously sized species of crane.\nThese creatures had an average animal degree of intelligence. Though generally non-aggressive, giant cranes were very protective of their mates, young, and nesting areas.\nThese creatures were a carnivorous species, preying upon large fish.\nGiant cranes were generally found in the same habitats of similar wading birds, such as ordinary cranes, herons, and bitterns. These habitats included marshes, swamps, lake verges, and along the banks of watercourses.\nGiant cranes could be found in Kara-Turs temperate plains, as well as in its tropical and sub-tropical swamps."
