Beyond Faer√ªn, they could be found in the temperate forests and plains of Kara-Tur.\nHedgehogs were one of the many small creatures that brambles were known to use as mounts.\nIn the church of Baervan Wildwanderer, \"Hedgehog\" was one of the titles for confirmed priests, ranking directly above \"Opossum\" and below \"Marten\"."
