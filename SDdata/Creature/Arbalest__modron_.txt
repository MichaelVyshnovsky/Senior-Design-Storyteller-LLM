An '''arbalest''' was a special kind of [[quadrone]] [[modron]], shaped something like the [[Arbalest|weapon of the same name]].

==Description==
An arbalest looked like a giant [[repeating crossbow]], with mechanical wings and four legs. Their bodies shot out metal crossbow [[bolt]]s.

==Abilities==
Besides appearance, arbalests functioned in a similar manner to other quadrones.

==History==
Twelve arbalests were known to guard the [[Simulacrux]], a trench and archway within a vast cavern of [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] in [[Undermountain]]. They had shot and killed two [[ogre]]s, who were part of a band of [[hobgoblin]]s led by Captain [[Kurlog]]. Kurlog was eager for help defeating the modrons so that he could defeat [[Zox Clammersham]].
