'''Qorrash''' ({{Singular|qorrashi}}) were [[genie]]s of cold and ice.

==Description==
Qorrash were [[elemental creature]]s native to the [[Elemental Plane of Air|Plane of Air]]. They had blue skin, which was always covered in thick frost, because a perpetual aura of bitter cold always emanated from their bodies. They had white hair. Males were often bald and sported fancy goatees; females wore their hair long. A typical qorrashi stood over ten feet (300 centimeters) tall and weighed about half a ton.

==Abilities==
Qorrash had such a strong connection to ice that they could walk on any surface of ice&mdash;even upside down. Like other genies, they had a wide assortment of inherent magical powers, including but not limited to the ability to [[Invisibility|turn invisible]], to [[ice storm|summon a storm of ice]], to turn into a [[gaseous form]], and to [[Wind walk|walk on the wind]]. A qorrashi could [[create food and water]] and [[major creation|other items]] and [[persistent image|generate powerful illusions]]. They could blast a [[cone of cold]] from their palms, and anyone struck by one of their blows would suffer a severe chill that could lead to frostbite.

Like all genies, qorrashi had [[darkvision]] and could [[plane shift]] to the [[elemental planes]], the [[Astral Plane]], or the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]].

==Language==
Qorrash usually spoke [[Auran]], [[Celestial language|Celestial]], [[Common]], and [[Ignan]]. They were also telepathic.

==Combat==
Qorrashi enjoyed fighting more than [[djinn]] did. They were confident in battle, yet they still used their magic to weaken their foes from a distance before closing in. If badly injured, they were not too proud to retreat.

==History==
The qorrash were distantly related to the djinn.

Qorrash shared a special relationship in the governance of the ancient [[giant]]s of the [[Jhoth没n]] Empire.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Frozen Wastes: Jhoth没n}}

==Notable Qorrash==
* The last [[Prince of Jhoth没n]]{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Frozen Wastes: The Prince of Jhoth没n}}
