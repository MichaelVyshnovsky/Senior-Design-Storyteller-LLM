        "mainbody": "Oortlings were docile humanoids with enlarged brains who were bred by illithids inhabiting Realmspace as a food source.\nOortlings resembled dwarves, but were very pallid and had bloated skulls that housed overdeveloped brains.\nOortlings, despite a lack of curiousity and creativity, still contained the potential for great intelligence. The breeding for larger brains by illithids had resulted in a massive gain for potential intellect, even though circumstances usually prevented them from reaching it.\nOortlings possessed no desire or ability for battle and fled during times of conflict. If cornered they pathetically scratched and bit at their foes.\nThe majority of the oortling people lived in skull farms maintained by the illithids on the planet Glyth and in its rings. There, they were subjected to a rigid breeding program, as their brain growth was constantly watched and monitored to produce best results, which were then sold to merchants. The richest of Glyths skull farms, kept by the illithid Surrell, was popular even in Greyspace.\nOortlings who were not being actively raised as cattle in Glyths rings lived in small communities inside comets across Realmspace. They fed on the mineral-rich ice from the comets, which provided them nourishment that simple water could not replace.\nTheir brain fluids could be used as a useful component for potions related to mental abilities such as telepathy, hinting at the capability for psionic powers.\nOortlings once had a sophisticated culture and were capable of constructing beautiful palaces from the ice of their comet homes, until they were dominated early in their history by the mind flayers across most crystal spheres.\nIn Realmspace, oortlings originally inhabited the comet KThoutek, but they were kidnapped by the mind flayers and transferred to the rings of Glyth to be bred and raised as cattle.\nBy the mid-14 century DR, even though oortlings could be found on many comets across Realmspace, the entire race had been reduced to a broken and fearful tribal society, its once advanced and sophisticated culture destroyed. However, although all creativity and curiosity had been bred out of the race by the illithids, the potential for great advances still had not."
