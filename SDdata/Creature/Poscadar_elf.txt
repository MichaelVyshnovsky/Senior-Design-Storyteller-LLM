The '''Poscadar elves''', or '''Poscadari''', were a group of bronze-skinned [[elf|elves]] living in the [[Pasocada Basin]].

==Geography==
The Poscadar elves lived in the rocky brush deserts of the Pasocada Basin north of the Long Canyon and the Pasocada River.

The [[Azuposi]] settlement of [[Elfmeet]], which was built on the edge of a canyon, was a favored place for the Poscadar elves to go to trade.

==Society==
The Poscadari were nomads, following and hunting the herds of wild animals. They were friendly to the Azuposi and often traded with them.

==History==
The Poscadari believed that they were created by the gods in a land of perpetual snow and ice, but a mighty shaman led them south where they first met and traded with the ancestors of the Azuposi.

There were rumors that the ancestors of the Poscadari built [[Esh Alakar]] and its accompanying bridge. However, the elves were silent on the matter.
