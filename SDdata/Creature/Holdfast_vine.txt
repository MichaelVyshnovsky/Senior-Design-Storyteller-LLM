'''Holdfast vines''' were a peculiar breed of [[vine blight]]s that had apparently not been spawned from a [[Gulthias tree]]. They were found in [[Forestfall Fen]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Behavior==
Holdfast vines had a thirst for fresh blood, and would seek it out by attacking anything that moved. They would lie dormant in the swamp until fresh blood revived them, and if slain, their forms would be consumed back into the swamp to feed it, a process which also alerted nearby holdfast vines of danger.

==Ecology==
The holdfast vines appeared to be a defense mechanism spawned by the gloomy Forestfall Fen, which proved to be a suitable environment for these vine blights despite the lack of a Gulthias tree. Holdfast vines appeared to be connected to trees which had become hale and hearty on a diet of blood.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, ongoing conflicts between the [[Queenstooth]] [[kobold]]s and [[Muckgrunter]] [[troll]]s in Forestfall Fen took a bloody turn with the advent of an invasion of [[meenlock]]s from the [[Feywild]]. As the Fen's baseline level of conflict was suddenly escalated into a much bigger fight, more blood began to be spilled and soon the holdfast vines awoke to wreck havoc on all sides.

==Notable==
* [[Smothertree]], a particularly large and powerful holdfast vine.
