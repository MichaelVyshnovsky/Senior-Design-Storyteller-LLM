        "mainbody": "Phycomids () were a type of subterranean fungus creature that could be dangerous to adventurers.\nPhycomids resembled white, fibrous blobs of decomposing matter with capped fungi growing out of them.\nWithin several clusters of a phycomids body were sensory organs that detected heat, sound, and vibrations.\nWhen attacking prey, phycomids discharged a highly alkaline substance in small globules from a tube-like appendage. This substance could potentially infect the targeted creatures, causing them to sprout mushroom-like growths that gradually spread throughout their body.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, several yak caravans and their drivers were found dead in Ra-Khati due to phycomids.\nBeyond Toril, phycomids could be found within the Underdark of the planet Krynn.\nIn the Abyss, they could be found in Shedaklah, the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss.\nPhycomids were one of many types of fungi that hook horrors were known to feast upon.\nSome drow were known to install phycomids in locations to act as traps."
