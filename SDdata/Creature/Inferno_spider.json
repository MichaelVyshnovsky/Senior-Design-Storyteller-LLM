        "mainbody": "'''Inferno spiders''' were [[elemental]] arachnids of [[fire]] native to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].",
        "Description": "These large elementals bore a resemblance to [[spider]]s and appeared to be composed entirely of magma and flame. Transparent plates on their bodies revealed a swirling mass of molten rock that formed their internal structure, while flames danced across the bulk of their abdomen and legs in random patterns. They had eight blazing eyes that were generally devoid of any expression.\n\nOn average inferno spiders stood approximately {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} tall, had a diameter of {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}}, and could weigh as much as {{SI|600|lbs.|k}}.",
        "Behavior": "These elementals possessed only a limited intelligence, yet were still very cunning and tenacious hunters. They were intelligent enough to realize the benefits of allying with stronger creatures and could follow simple orders.",
        "Abilities": "These elementals had [[poison]]ous fangs, dripping in a sort of caustic liquid flame that burned victims from within. They could produce webs composed of a fiery substance. This substance kept them burning near indefinitely, but was vulnerable to cold-based attacks.",
        "Combat": "An inferno spider always began to engage their prey by attempting to entangle them in one of their webs. This allowed them to capture creatures that were otherwise too nimble or quick.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "These elementals were voracious predators that hunted creatures weaker than themselves.",
            "Homelands": "Besides the Elemental Plane of Fire, these elementals could occasionally be found on the [[Prime Material plane]] in warm regions.\n\nAt least one inferno spider made its way to [[Faer√ªn]] by crawling through a portal linking the Plane of Fire with the citadel of [[Belkram's Fall]] in [[Undermountain]].",
            "Relationships": "Weaker denizens of the Elemental Plane of Fire universally loathed these elementals. They were often in the company of [[cleric]]s of [[Fire domain|fire]] [[deities]], [[fire elemental]]s, or groups of cunning [[salamander]]s. They were particularly attracted to individuals that possessed great [[arcane magic|arcane]] or [[divine magic|divine power]].\n\nThe vast majority of inferno spiders were [[favored monster|servants]] of the deity [[Kossuth]], whom they revered. To them he appeared as an enormous inferno spider of great age and strength. One of his faction of worshipers, the [[Burning Braziers]], sought to introduce them to [[Toril]] as part of their quest to cleanse the world. However, for unknown reasons the deity only allowed them limited summoning of these elementals."
        },
        "History": "Following [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s death in [[1375 DR]], an inferno spider and a trio of [[magma hurler]]s crossed over into the [[Prime Material plane]] through a [[portal]] that opened in the [[Belkram's Fall]] area of [[Undermountain]] and proceeded to make their lair there.\n\nOn [[Ches 29]], in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, a [[vampire]] in service of [[Szass Tam]] named [[Tammith Iltazyarra]] infiltrated the ziggurat of [[Church of Kossuth|Kossuth]] in [[Escalant]]. As she progressed through it Tammith was assailed by an inferno spider, which after a short battle she managed to slay.<ref name=\"Un-p29-36>",
        "Trivia": "[[Sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and clerics with access to the [[fire domain]] could summon inferno spiders through use of ''[[summon monster IV]]'' or a high level ''[[summon monster]]'' [[spell]]. Alternatively, such clerics could call them to their aid through use of ''[[planar ally]]''. Accomplishing any of these required completion of a magical ritual that involved the power of [[fire opal]]s worth 100 [[gold piece]]s."
