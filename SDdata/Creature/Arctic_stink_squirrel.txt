Arctic stink squirrels were creatures found in Icewind Dale. They were sometimes kept as familiars.
Arctic stink squirrels owed their unflattering name to their ability to exude a stench comparable to a stinking cloud.
Although noted to be fierce in the wild, domesticated arctic stink squirrels were playful and snuggly companion animals.
