        "mainbody": "Fire elemental myrmidons, otherwise known as fire myrmidons or fire archons, were a variety of elemental myrmidon, beings created by conjuring and bonding elementals &mdash in this case, of elemental fire &mdash into ritually created suits of armor to act as servile weapons of war.\nFire myrmidons were beings composed entirely of elemental fire, with bodies that were roughly human size and shape.\nDepending on their need, their fingers were either true digits or blended together into a mittenlike form. Their heads had a defined front and back, but lacked facial features. Whenever they became angry or agitated, two brighter eyelike points could appear on their face.\nThey typically stood roughly  tall and weighed close to . The latter fact was due to their bodes having some solidity to them, despite being made of transparent and flickering flames.\nLike all elemental myrmidons, they wore thick armor, typically of a plate variety. These not only protected them against attacks, but contained their form and was integral to their being. After some time they were capable of removing this armor and replacing it with something else, but many never saw any need to do so. Their armor was all that would remain of them when killed.\nWhenever they chose new armor it was to replace a sundered piece or because of the new armors capabilities. The most common forms of new armor taken were breastplates, chain mail, chain shirts, and full plate.\nFire myrmidons were the most destructive in nature of all the elemental myrmidons and thought of everything in terms of conflict. They brutishly remained ever aware of what side they were on, their subordinates and commanders, current foes, and who they were to face in some later fight. But they also possessed great cunning and tactical minds.\nThose in service to efreet often sought to emulate them.\nFire myrmidons were immune to the effects of diseases and poisons, as they were composed wholly of elemental essence. Though they did need to \"breath\", in the sense that fires needed air.\nAny time one of their limbs was severed it would quickly regrow, with the severed part burning away in a swirl of fire and smoke. They could set things alight with their bodies, though it required some concentration. And they were incapable of diminishing the amount of light that their bodies emitted, which was comparable to a bonfire.\nAsh Disciples These fire myrmidons caused noticeable effects on local weather patterns, such as prolonged droughts or heat waves. They could hurl fire, unleash pounding waves of heat, and engulf their enemies in blinding clouds of cinders. When slain they would explode in a burst of fiery embers.\nBlazesteels These fire myrmidons let out bursts of fire whenever they were injured, in addition to when they were slain.\nEmberguards These fire myrmidons were surrounded by a cloud of embers, burning any foe that came too close to them.\nFlamebows These fire myrmidons could teleport short distances and would explode into a burst of fire when slain.\nFire myrmidons were never inclined to stealth.\nThey typically preferred to fight with metal weaponry that was evocative of flames, thus they avoided the use of heavy or bludgeoning weaponry. They were most commonly seen fighting with falchions, scimitars, and even rapiers. Regardless of what weapon they used, it was considered magical.\nAsh disciples preferred to fight their foes from afar with their fire-based abilities, while blazesteels and emberguards preferred to fight in close quarters, using their greataxe and scimitars respectively. For particularly irksome foes, an emberguard would empower their greataxe with higher degrees of fire essence.\nIn late 15 century DR, fire myrmidons could be found inhabiting Mount Hotenow. There many served in the fighting forces of the Cult of Maegera, being stationed at Firecross Bridge and in Shadowfire Cavern. Also during this time, fire myrmidons were utilized as minions by the wizard Kabal the Firesoul.\nDuring the Elemental Evil crisis, fire myrmidons and their variants were utilized by members of one of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis, the Cult of the Eternal Flame.\nthumb|273px|From left to right an ash disciple, a blazesteel, and an emberguard.\nAsh disciple One of the more powerful varieties of fire myrmidons. They were equivalent to war priests, aspiring for a day when fire would immolate and cleanse the world. They wore scale armor, rather than plate, and they typically wore metal robes atop them.\nBlazesteel One of the more powerful varieties of fire myrmidons. They were the most ill-tempered and easily provoked, growing more courageous as they were injured. They served as shock troopers within elemental armies.\nEmberguards The term used for the basic variety of fire myrmidon. These served as the guardians of temples, tombs, and other locations with strong ties to elemental fire. They also guarded portals leading to the Elemental Chaos. Within armies made up of elemental creatures, they served as infantry.\nFlamebows Fire myrmidons that were specialized in the use of bows. They were often seen wearing chainmail, rather than plate.\nFlameshields Fire myrmidons that were specialized in the use of shields.\nLike any elemental myrmidons, when left to their own devices these beings would form societies that had the same structure, one that was roughly militaristic. They were rigidly disciplined and had hierarchies based on rank, with rank determining every aspect of life in their stronghold. These ranks did not have proper titles, as fire myrmidons simply knew where they and others ranked. They did not challenge authority or compete against one another for rank, each being satisfied with their station and feeling they best serve in that position.Dragon #361s article, \"Ecology of the Fire Archons,\" states that fire archon societies used, \"physical and strategic contests, usually not lethal . . . to determine rank.\" The sourcebook, The Plane Below, retcons this with the information provided herein.\nOutside of combat, fire myrmidons spent much of their time trying to hone their knowledge of strategy and tactics, engaging in tactical exercises, or sparring. Constantly training for the next conflict, which satisfied their innate desire to make war. Besides that they were excellent craftsmen, able to create masterwork quality items on par with those created by dwarves. Nearly everything they crafted had a flame motif decorating it.\nFire myrmidons freed from service to efreet were likely to emulate the society of their creators. Securing territory, building structures, and keeping slaves.Dragon #361s article, \"Ecology of the Fire Archons,\" states that fire archons slaves were treated badly because of a lack of empathy. The sourcebook, The Plane Below, retcons this by stating that poor treatment of slaves was \"not out of deliberate cruelty.\"\nSome said that constructing an elemental archon required a special foundry, with a special forge built in a significant concentration of elemental energy, and a summoning crucible that served as the transformation space. These forges rarely appeared like a common forge, being unrecognizable contraptions of arcane and elemental magic.\nA working foundry could produce them as often as the ritual could be performed and for as long as the foundrys resources were maintained. The forges power determine what kind of myrmidon was created. A forge with ebbing power could only generate the most basic of fire myrmidons, while those at high flow could produce more powerful varieties, such as blazesteels and ash disciples.\nThe majority of fire myrmidons in existence were created either by efreet or other fire myrmidons.\nMany were known to serve Imix, the evil archomental of elemental fire. They could also be found working for or alongside ancient red dragons, fire titans, guardian nagas, phoenixes, salamanders, and volcanic dragons. Those known as \"blazesteels\" were often employed as bodyguards by fire titans and powerful efreet.\nPowerful fire myrmidons sometimes lured magma beasts into serving them.\nIn the City of Brass, many fire archons served as soldiers to the ruling efreet.\nFire myrmidons believed themselves to have been the first type of elemental myrmidons ever created, though there was nothing to prove this.\n* Ignazar, a servant of the primordial Maegera.\n* Immolus, a servant of the fire giant Gommoth in the late 15 century DR.\n* At some point Baba Yaga enslaved four fire myrmidons and brought them to live inside the smithy of her dancing hut, having them produce all manner of metalwork."
