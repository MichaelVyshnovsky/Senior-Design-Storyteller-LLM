        "mainbody": "'''Fire elemental myrmidons''', otherwise known as '''fire myrmidons''' or '''fire archons''', were a variety of [[elemental myrmidon]], beings created by conjuring and bonding [[elemental]]s &mdash; in this case, of [[elemental fire]] &mdash; into ritually created suits of [[armor]] to act as servile weapons of war.{{MyrmidonArchon-Connection}}",
        "Description": {
            "Armor": "Like all elemental myrmidons, they wore thick armor, typically of a [[plate mail|plate]] variety. These not only protected them against attacks, but contained their form and was integral to their being. After some time they were capable of removing this armor and replacing it with something else, but many never saw any need to do so. Their armor was all that would remain of them when killed.\n\nWhenever they chose new armor it was to replace a sundered piece or because of the new armor's capabilities. The most common forms of new armor taken were [[breastplate]]s, [[chain mail]], [[chain shirt]]s, and [[full plate]]."
        },
        "Personality": "Fire myrmidons were the most destructive in nature of all the elemental myrmidons and thought of everything in terms of conflict. They brutishly remained ever aware of what side they were on, their subordinates and commanders, current foes, and who they were to face in some later fight. But they also possessed great cunning and tactical minds.\n\nThose in service to [[efreet]] often sought to emulate them.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Ash Disciples": "These fire myrmidons caused noticeable effects on local weather patterns, such as prolonged droughts or heat waves. They could hurl fire, unleash pounding waves of heat, and engulf their enemies in blinding clouds of cinders. When slain they would explode in a burst of fiery embers.",
            "Blazesteels": "These fire myrmidons let out bursts of fire whenever they were injured, in addition to when they were slain.",
            "Emberguards": "These fire myrmidons were surrounded by a cloud of embers, burning any foe that came too close to them.",
            "Flamebows": "These fire myrmidons could [[teleport]] short distances and would explode into a burst of fire when slain."
        },
        "Combat": "Fire myrmidons were never inclined to stealth.\n\nThey typically preferred to fight with metal weaponry that was evocative of flames, thus they avoided the use of heavy or bludgeoning weaponry. They were most commonly seen fighting with [[falchion]]s, [[scimitar]]s, and even [[rapier]]s. Regardless of what weapon they used, it was considered [[magic item|magical]].\n\nAsh disciples preferred to fight their foes from afar with their fire-based abilities, while blazesteels and emberguards preferred to fight in close quarters, using their [[greataxe]] and scimitars respectively. For particularly irksome foes, an emberguard would empower their greataxe with higher degrees of fire essence.",

Also during this time, fire myrmidons were utilized as minions by the [[wizard]] [[Kabal|Kabal the Firesoul]].\n\nDuring the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis, fire myrmidons and their variants were utilized by members of one of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis, the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]].",

            "Blazesteel": "One of the more powerful varieties of fire myrmidons. They were the most ill-tempered and easily provoked, growing more courageous as they were injured. They served as shock troopers within elemental armies.",
            "Emberguards": "The term used for the basic variety of fire myrmidon. These served as the guardians of temples, tombs, and other locations with strong ties to elemental fire.

Those known as \"blazesteels\" were often employed as bodyguards by fire titans and powerful efreet.\n\nPowerful fire myrmidons sometimes lured [[magma beast]]s into serving them.\n\nIn the City of Brass, many fire archons served as soldiers to the ruling efreet."
