        "mainbody": "Wisplings were planetouched descended from the breeding of halflings and demons.\nWisplings were of apparently normal halfling size and shape, with light brown skin and bright red hair, as well as angular features. They typically preferred to wear brightly colored clothing.\nWisplings were energetic and normally unable to stay still. They were also deceptive and fond of pranks that ranged from merely mischievous to cruel.\nWisplings had a natural talent for stealth, as well as an innate ability to appear as any humanoid creature one time each day.\nWisplings used their speed, instinct, and natural cruelty to be more dangerous than their small size would suggest. They typically preferred to ambush foes, then flee before they were cornered."
