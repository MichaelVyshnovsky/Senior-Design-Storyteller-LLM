        "Description": "Half-ogres had a height somewhere between that of a human and an ogre and taller than a [[half-orc]], often between seven and eight feet (210 and 240 centimeters). They usually weighed between 315 and 425 pounds (143 and 193 kilograms).\n\nA half-ogre's skin tone ranged from pale yellow to dull brown",
        "Personality": "Half-ogres were not very intelligent, and they typically were greatly lacking in self-control. They tended to enjoy the simple pleasures of life&mdash;eating, drinking, and partying.\n\nMany half-ogres worship [[Vaprak]], the god of ogres.\n\nIt should be noted that their chaotic alignment was not compulsory for all. Arzastra, a female half-ogre in Xantharl's Keep was lawful good, for example.",
        "Society": "Half-ogres were generally thought of as large, strong, and stupid among human civilizations, but considered exactly the opposite way by ogre tribes. They were especially not trusted by [[Dwarf|dwarves]] or [[gnome]]s, because of their ancestry.",
        "Notable Half-Ogres": "* [[Haffa]], a merchant in [[Skullport]]\n* [[Togrev]] the Magnificent, \"lord high commander of [[Pundaria]]\""
