They usually weighed between 315 and 425 pounds (143 and 193 kilograms).\nA half-ogres skin tone ranged from pale yellow to dull brown\nHalf-ogres were not very intelligent, and they typically were greatly lacking in self-control. They tended to enjoy the simple pleasures of life&mdasheating, drinking, and partying.\nMany half-ogres worship Vaprak, the god of ogres.\nIt should be noted that their chaotic alignment was not compulsory for all. Arzastra, a female half-ogre in Xantharls Keep was lawful good, for example.\nHalf-ogres were generally thought of as large, strong, and stupid among human civilizations, but considered exactly the opposite way by ogre tribes. They were especially not trusted by dwarves or gnomes, because of their ancestry.\n* Haffa, a merchant in Skullport\n* Togrev the Magnificent, \"lord high commander of Pundaria\""
