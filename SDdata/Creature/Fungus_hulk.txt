The fungus hulkNo name is given for the creature, though the narration shows Raidon Kane names it mentally a "fungus hulk". A so-named creature appeared in Return to White Plume Mountain, whose main designer was the same as the author of Stardeep. As the author is the same, it is instead assumed that the name of "fungus hulk" was an intentional reference to such a creature. was a creature that fought alongside Kiril Duskmourn, Adrik Commorand and Raidon Kane in the Underdungeon beneath Stardeep. It resembled an umber hulk made of fungus.
The fungus hulk was a bulky, hunch-backed humanoid with a black bony carapace that only partly concealed its mushroomy flesh. A puffball covered its head, from which questing filaments extended. It had black, large claws like daggers. These claws had obsidian incorporated, which was stained violet from the fungal exudations the bony carapace was actually dissolved limestone.
Of note, the fungus hulks strength and power were such that it could shatter even the bodies of revived fossils with a swing. Their touch also inflicted a deadly rotting disease that might well kill its targets within a minute. Even those who received healing were bound to lose an extremity. Plants that were damaged by the hulks suffered almost twice as much damage.
Fungus hulks were unaffected by heat, and by most controlling spells, such as charm, hold monster, and sleep. Even sorcerous fire was only half as effective. Their carapace incorporated dissolved limestone the creature actively incorporated obsidian fragments on its extremities to aid in its digging.
The fungus hulk was intelligent enough to accept the aid of strangers while fighting revived fossils. even unto its ultimate death.
While attempting to reach Stardeep through the Underdungeon, Kiril Duskmourn, Raidon Kane and Adrik Commorand came across a fungus hulk in the caverns. They later fought alongside a fungus hulk, perhaps the same one. Before it died of its wounds, it helped them retreat from the fight with Adriks body.
In the 15 century DR, fungal hulks were known to inhabit the Chondalwood.
