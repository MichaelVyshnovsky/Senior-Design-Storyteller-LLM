It was also commonplace on the tables of local inns, as a well-roasted dish and as an ingredient in wildsage stew.\nBeyond Faerûn they could be found in Evermeet, where they were non-hostile towards elves and occasionally hunted by gold elves. In the Hordelands, they could be found at the lowest levels of the Katakoro Plateau.\nBears were a favored animal of several deities, including Bahgtru, Eldath, Geb, Malar, Rillifane Rallathil, and Solonor Thelandira. The dwarven god Clangeddin both favored cave bears in particular, while slumbering Ulutiu preferred polar bears.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold bear hides for 5 gp a piece."
