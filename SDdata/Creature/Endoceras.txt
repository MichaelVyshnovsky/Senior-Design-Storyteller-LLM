'''Endoceras''', also known colloquially as '''sea javelins''' for an alleged behavior, were a type of large [[nautilus]]-like creature found in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

==Rumors & Legends==
A number of sailors reported that these creatures would use their shells to pierce the ice when hunting prey. However, naturalists and [[zoology|zoologist]]s were reluctant to describe such behavior in bestiaries, due to the penchant for embellishment that sailors often had.
