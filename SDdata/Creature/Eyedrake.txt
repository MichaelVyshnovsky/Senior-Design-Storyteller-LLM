Eyedrakes were the result of a beholder dreaming of a dragon.
Eyedrakes vaguely resembled a draconic creature, but lacked true limbsâ€”the wings were formed of multiple eyestalks, and another large eye was located inside of the perpetually open mouth.
Eyedrakes on their own exhibited behaviors similar to those of young dragons, such as establishing a lair and hoard. They fought to the death to defend their hoard, refusing to relinquish even the smallest bauble.
Eyedrakes had the magic eye-rays of beholders the eye in the mouth emitted the antimagic cone and the wing-eyestalks unleashed, variously, a freezing ray, a repulsion ray, a fire ray, a paralysis-inducing ray, and a necrotizing ray.
Sometimes, when a beholder had to compete against a dragon for wealth or territory, it grew obsessed with its draconic rival to the point that its obsession pervaded its dreams if the obsession lasted long enough, the fevered dreams lead to the creation of an eyedrake.
Because of their peculiar nature, eyedrakes required neither food nor drink.
