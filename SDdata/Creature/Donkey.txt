A '''donkey''' or '''ass''' was an equine species, often domesticated and used as a working animal.

==Species==
;Desert Jackass: A species of donkey that was endemic to the [[Raurin]], who had roamed in huge herds prior to the once fertile land becoming a desert. Once domesticated they became very familiar, considering their owners family, thus they had an expectation to be allowed indoors and to share their master's sleeping quarters. On average they grew to be {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder and could manage carrying up to {{SI|400|lb|k|long=yes}}.<ref>
;[[Uglib]]: An impressively hardy breed of donkey that was bred by [[dwarves]].

==Ecology==
These creatures were often herded among other grazing beasts in order to protect them from wild predators, such as [[coyote]]s or [[wild dog]]s.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/Alpacas in the Dales, Protecting Mules or Donkeys}}
===Diet===
Donkeys were well accustomed to eating [[grass]], requiring no separate fodder.<ref>

==Rumors and legends==
The appearance of donkeys could indicate the presence of [[Ilmater]], the deity of suffering and martyrdom.
