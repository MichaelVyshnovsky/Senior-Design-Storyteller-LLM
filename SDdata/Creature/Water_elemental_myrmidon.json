Being kept too far from water could affect their loyalty to a master. They also valued having frequent opportunities to spread misery and woe.\nWater myrmidons were immune to the effects of diseases and poisons, as they were composed wholly of elemental essence. \nThey were impervious to harm from water-based spells or abilities, but those that were cold-based would hinder their movements. And they were uniquely able to temporarily infuse their weapon strikes with elemental ice.\nShoal Reavers These water myrmidons could make temporary harpoons out of solid water and conjure forth small whirlpools.\nWaveshapers These water myrmidons could manipulate the water by gesturing with their fans. Conjuring forth small waves, whirlpools, or geysers. As well as empowering aquatic or water elemental creatures.\nThe standard variety of water myrmidon, shoal reavers, typically fought with tridents. While those known as tide striders and waveshapers typically fought with greatspears and dual war fans respectively. Regardless of what weapon a water myrmidon used, it was considered magical.\nShoal reavers and tide striders both fought in close quarters, using their agility in water to their advantage, while watershapers fought from afar with their abilities. Shoal reavers would often use their water harpoons to pull creatures closer to the water before conjuring forth whirlpools.\nDuring the Elemental Evil crisis, water myrmidons and their variants were utilized by members of one of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis, the Cult of the Crushing Wave.\nthumb|273px|From left to right a waveshaper, a shoal reaver, and a tide strider.\nShoal Reavers The term used for the basic variety of water myrmidon.\nTide Striders One of the more powerful varieties of water myrmidons. They were the most agile at moving through water and known for being quite reserved and violent.\nWaveshapers One of the more powerful varieties of water myrmidons. They were equivalent to war priests, aspiring for a day when Prime Material worlds would be drowned by the churning waters of the Elemental Chaos. They typically wore robes atop their armor and were known for creating great ships made of semisolid water, which could rise and submerged as they willed.\nLike any elemental myrmidons, when left to their own devices these beings would form societies that had the same structure, one that was roughly militaristic. They were rigidly disciplined and had hierarchies based on rank, with rank determining every aspect of life in their stronghold. These ranks did not have proper titles, as water myrmidons simply knew where they and others ranked. They did not challenge authority or compete against one another for rank, each being satisfied with their station and feeling they best serve in that position.\nFree water myrmidons traveled on the great water ships crafted by waveshapers, engaging in pirate activity. They were known to construct outposts in lakes or swamps, which they traveled between by treating rivers and streams as highways.\nOutside of combat, water myrmidons spent much of their time trying to hone their knowledge of strategy and tactics, engaging in tactical exercises, or sparring. Constantly training for the next conflict, which satisfied their innate desire to make war. \nSome said that constructing an elemental archon required a special foundry, with a special forge built in a significant concentration of elemental energy, and a summoning crucible that served as the transformation space. These forges rarely appeared like a common forge, being unrecognizable contraptions of arcane and elemental magic.\nA working foundry could produce them as often as the ritual could be performed and for as long as the foundrys resources were maintained. The forges power determine what kind of myrmidon was created. A forge with ebbing power could only generate the most basic of water myrmidons, while those at high flow could produce more powerful varieties, such as tide striders and waveshapers.\nMany were known to serve Olhydra, the evil archomental of elemental water. Beyond this, they often found themselves in the service of masters who were like the ocean quite destructive and unpredictable in nature, such as aboleths or human pirates."
