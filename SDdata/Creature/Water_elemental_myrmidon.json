        "mainbody": "'''Water elemental myrmidons''', otherwise known as '''water myrmidons''' or '''water archons''', were a variety of [[elemental myrmidon]], beings created by conjuring and bonding [[elemental]]s &mdash; in this case, of [[elemental water]] &mdash; into ritually created suits of [[armor]] to act as servile weapons of war.{{MyrmidonArchon-Connection}}",
        "Description": "Water myrmidons were beings composed entirely of elemental water, with bodies that were roughly [[human]] size and shape.\n\nLike all elemental myrmidons, they wore thick armor, typically of a [[plate mail|plate]]{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} Their armor was all that would remain of them when killed.",
        "Personality": "Though they were capable of moving on land and would do so on ocassion as a surprise tactic, they preferred to remain near water. Being kept too far from water could affect their loyalty to a master. They also valued having frequent opportunities to spread misery and woe.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Shoal Reavers": "These water myrmidons could make temporary [[harpoon]]s out of solid water and conjure forth small whirlpools.",
            "Waveshapers": "These water myrmidons could manipulate the water by gesturing with their fans. Conjuring forth small waves, whirlpools, or geysers. As well as empowering aquatic or water elemental creatures."
        },
        "Combat": "The standard variety of water myrmidon, shoal reavers, typically fought with [[trident]]s. While those known as tide striders and waveshapers typically fought with [[greatspear]]s and dual [[war fan]]s respectively. Regardless of what weapon a water myrmidon used, it was considered [[magic item|magical]].\n\nShoal reavers and tide striders both fought in close quarters, using their agility in water to their advantage, while watershapers fought from afar with their abilities. Shoal reavers would often use their water harpoons to pull creatures closer to the water before conjuring forth whirlpools.",
        "History": "{{main|Elemental myrmidon#History}}\n\nDuring the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis, water myrmidons and their variants were utilized by members of one of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis, the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]].",
        "Varieties": {
            "Shoal Reavers": "The term used for the basic variety of water myrmidon.",
            "Tide Striders": "One of the more powerful varieties of water myrmidons. They were the most agile at moving through water and known for being quite reserved and violent.",
            "Waveshapers": "One of the more powerful varieties of water myrmidons. They were equivalent to war priests, aspiring for a day when [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] worlds would be drowned by the churning waters of the [[Elemental Chaos]]. They typically wore [[robe]]s atop their armor and were known for creating great ships made of semisolid water, which could rise and submerged as they willed."

        "Society": {
            "Creation": "Some said that constructing an elemental archon required a special foundry, with a special forge built in a significant concentration of elemental energy,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|42}} and a summoning crucible that served as the transformation space. These forges rarely appeared like a common forge, being unrecognizable contraptions of [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[elemental magic]].\n\nA working foundry could produce them as often as the ritual could be performed and for as long as the foundry's resources were maintained. The forge's power determine what kind of myrmidon was created.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|44}} A forge with ebbing power could only generate the most basic of water myrmidons, while those at high flow could produce more powerful varieties,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} such as tide striders and waveshapers.",
            "Relationships": "Many were known to serve [[Olhydra]], the evil [[archomental]] of elemental water.{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|25, 28}} Beyond this, they often found themselves in the service of masters who were like the ocean quite destructive and unpredictable in nature, such as [[aboleth]]s or [[human]] pirates."
