An amphisbaena (|audio=amphisbaena.ogg) resembled a pit viper with, instead of one head, two of them at each end of its body.
An amphisbaenas skin molted just like other snakes, and little horns above each eye helped it to shed its skin. The skin of an amphisbaena had the same variations as found in normal vipers. 
Amphisbaenae slithered sideways just like other snakes. It could step up its pace of movement by grabbing its own head with the other and rolling like a hoop.
In combat, amphisbaenae could use both heads to snap at opponents simultaneously. This enabled the monster to attack and defend at the same time.
Upon impending death, an amphisbaena would attempt to bite its own head with the other so as to turn itself into stone.
Sages documented the hatching of a clutch of amphisbaenae in the town of Chariton in Battledale in the late 14 century DR. The townspeople were proven ignorant to the danger when the unattended amphisbaenae grew to immense proportions and slaughtered most of the towns inhabitants. Since that time, the town of Chariton was a ghost town. It was said that the amphisbaenae left the town after they had depleted it as a source of food and moved on to the forests near the Pool of Yeven, the Deeping Stream, and Lake Sember.
