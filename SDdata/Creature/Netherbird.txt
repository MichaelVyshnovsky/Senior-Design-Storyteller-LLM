'''Netherbirds ''' were a species of [[bird]]s who served the god of tyranny [[Bane]].

==Description==
Netherbirds ranged in size from small to near-[[human]]-sized, but they had black, dusty feathers, hideously large talons, and razor-sharp beaks, and they usually stank of blood and decay.

==Behavior==
Netherbirds were relatively intelligent for animals, and could be trained as messenger birds.

==Abilities/Combat==
Netherbirds attacked with beak and talon, screaming and hissing at their prey as they did so. They could fly, and quickly, but were not particularly skilled in the air.

==Ecology==
Netherbirds were always found in flocks of 3â€“30 specimens. They laired in the desolate regions of crags and high, rolling moors.

==Biology==
Netherbirds would eat all manner of flesh, living or dead. Their black, leathery eggs hatched unattended.

==History==
Netherbirds served Bane, but may have originally come from [[Avernus]].
