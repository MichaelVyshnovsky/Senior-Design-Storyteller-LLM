Robberwings were big raven-like birds found to the south of the Sea of Fallen Stars that were often trained to steal.
Robberwings resembled large ravens.
Robberwings had a limited ability to imitate human speech, generally not more than a single word, or a fragment of a sentence.
Robberwings were attracted to shiny objects, crystals, jewelry, gold, etc. They, on occasion, would steal these objects and stash them in their nest. Other then this felonious habit these birds were harmless.
They were commonly encountered on the southern shores of the Inner Sea. They were notoriously well-known on the Sword Coast as well.
Waterdevian crime lords were known to train robberwings to steal for them. They also were considered an ill omen in Thay.
