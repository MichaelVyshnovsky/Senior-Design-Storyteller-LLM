'''Robberwings''' were big [[raven]]-like [[bird]]s found to the south of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] that were often trained to steal.
{{quote|''"Lee-as, Lee-as, Lee-as," the bird shrieked as it rose straight up, spun, and flapped in an ungainly manner toward the nearest cliff wall, taking [[Alias]]'s weapon with it.''}}

==Description==
Robberwings resembled large ravens.

==Abilities==
Robberwings had a limited ability to imitate [[human]] speech, generally not more than a single word, or a fragment of a sentence.

==Behavior==
Robberwings were attracted to shiny objects, crystals, jewelry, gold, ''etc''. They, on occasion, would steal these objects and stash them in their nest. Other then this felonious habit these birds were harmless.

==Ecology==
They were commonly encountered on the southern shores of the [[Inner Sea]]. They were notoriously well-known on the [[Sword Coast]] as well.

==History==
[[Waterdeep|Waterdevian]] crime lords were known to train robberwings to steal for them. They also were considered an ill omen in [[Thay]].
