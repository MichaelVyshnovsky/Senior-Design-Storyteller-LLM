A cryo snake was a large snake that attacked with icy breath. They were the cold equivalent of pyro snakes.
Like other snakes, cryo snakes had animal-like intelligence. These green-blue snakes were ferocious.
These large snakes were completely immune to cold-based attacks. They attacked with icy breath similar to that of a white dragon.
Cryo snakes were rarely encountered by other races, as they only inhabited very high elevations where the temperature was dangerously cold. They only really moved down during extraordinarily cold winters.
They were known to lurk in the palace of Gothmenes.
