        "mainbody": "Zombie grave diggers were a variant of zombies that existed in the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering. They were created by necromancers to replace the mortal helpers that were usually hired to carry out the manual labor aspects of acquiring raw materials for necromancy, though in a pinch could also serve as impromptu bodyguards. As befitting their purpose, they were typically created from the corpses of failed grave robbers.\nThese zombies were always dressed in darkly colored work attire. They always had a variety of tools on hand to aid them in the task of robbing graves, such as hammers, spades, prybars, and a hefty shovel. Both their flesh and these various tools were always found to be encrusted in grime in dirt from the graves they despoiled.\nLike other zombies they were resistant to harm from necrotic energy, but vulnerable to radiant energy.\nRather than using their teeth and bare fits, these zombies fought with their hefty shovels and would attempt to blind foes by flinging filth or rotting bits of themselves. They tended to prioritize attacking individuals that matched the description of body types they were ordered to collect. When operating in groups, one of them would focus on escaping with the body while the others remained behind to guard the fleeing zombies rear. \nAround the late 15 century DR, a human necromancer from the Bleak Academy was operating in Tymanther, in an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke. Deep within a mausoleum at the burial site, the necromancer created a number of undead through use of the spell undead servitor.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of \"the old Untheric Empire\" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus in the mausoleum, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. One of these undead was a zombie grave digger, which confronted a group of adventurers in the graveyard outside the tomb when they came to rescue the missing dwarf Melnar."
