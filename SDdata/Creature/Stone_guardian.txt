A '''stone guardian''' was a rare variant of a [[stone golem]].

==Description==
These constructs were medium-to-large in size, and made of hard rock. They seemed to resemble stone [[golem]]s, and were also non-intelligent. Stone guardians could, thanks to the [[magic]]al [[spell]]s used in their creation, see and hear.

==Combat==
These golems attacked with their huge arms, slamming opponents with great force. They would never back down from combat, and would continue to attack until completely destroyed.

Stone guardians were impervious to normal missile attacks, and only took a small amount of damage from edged [[weapon]]s. As well as this, they only took half the regular damage from [[fire]], cold-based, and electrical-based attacks and [[spell]]s. As they had no living body or mind, [[poison]]s and any sort of mental-based spells, such as ''[[charm]]'', had zero effect.

Despite a large number of immunities, any spell that could transmute their stone-like forms would destroy them. Spells such as ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'', ''[[dig]]'', and ''[[stone to flesh]]'' were fatal to such constructs.

==Ecology==
===Creation===
Stone guardians were created by forming a base shape, similar to that of a [[human]] or an [[ogre]], out of mud. The mud structure must then be supplied with a heart of stone. As with other golems, a powerful [[mage]] must cast several spells on the incomplete golem, in this case ''[[enchant item]]'', ''[[wish]]'' (or ''[[limited wish]]''), ''[[transmute mud to rock]]'', ''[[magic mouth]]'', and optionally, ''[[detect invisibility]]''. If the optional spell was used, the golem was able to detect invisible creatures.

After creation, the golems had to undergo an activation sequence. Even accomplished [[wizard]]s were subject to potential failure of activating a stone guardian, owing to the highly precise nature of such activation. However, particular ''[[ring of protection|rings of protection]]'' could be produced and given to allies, to stop them from being attacked by the golem. The effect of such rings had a 10-foot-radius (3.0 meters), so even more allies could be protected in a tight area. Each of these [[ring]]s were attuned to only a particular stone guardian.

[[Specialty priest]]s of [[Segojan Earthcaller]], the [[gnome]] [[deity]] called Earthfriend, could temporarily create one of these creatures with a [[Call stone guardian|single spell]].
===Usages===
Stone guardians were known to have been used as protectors of entrances to important buildings, particularly in [[Myth Drannor]]. Magical ''[[ring of stone|rings of stone]]'' could transform into empowered stone guardians upon the wearer's command.
===Relationships===
These constructs were a [[favored monster]] of the deities [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] and Segojan Earthcaller.
