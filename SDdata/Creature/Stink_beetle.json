        "mainbody": "Stink beetles were a species of giant beetle that could produce miasmal stench in self-defense.\nStink beetles looked similar to other giant beetles. Their main distinction was their horn, used in combat and presumably mating rituals, as well as their green compound eyes. Out of all beetle species, they were said to most resemble the slicer beetle.\nThese creatures often acted in a similar manner to slicer beetles. They would attack anything that provoked them or that they identified as prey.\nStink beetles main combat ability was emitting a noxious gas that could render their opponents unconscious. That ability was akin to the stinking cloud spell. Once the attacker was on the ground, the beetle proceeded to attack, slashing with its horn. Upon death, the beetles poison gas glands discharged one last time, affecting everyone within  from the dying insect.\nThey were immune to mind-affecting smells as well as the stinking cloud.\nStink beetles were somewhat uncommon creatures, found only in a handful of underground and swamp locations around Neverwinter. These foul-smelling insects were carriers of the vermin madness disease.\nIn 1372 DR, these bugs infested the underground tunnel between Lady Tanglebrooks house and the city prison in the Peninsula district of Neverwinter. The same year wizardÂ Meldanen from the Blacklake District of Neverwinter, had stink beetles, along with other tamed creatures, within his spacious mansion.\nAfter the Wailing Death plague of 1372 DR, Spindrift Towns sewers were home to spindriftian stink beetles."
