'''Silverling''' was a species of tiny freshwater [[fish]] that was abundantly present in the [[Savage Frontier]]. These little creatures were caught in the nets along with bigger, more valuable fish, making them a cheap and simple food source.

==Description==
Silverlings had a very similar taste to [[sardine]]s, a small type of fish found along the [[Sword Coast]]. Unlike their coastal cousins, silverlings had more of a complex smoky and [[mushroom]]y flavor.

==Use==
In the hamlet of [[Mornbryn's Shield]], the local inn called the [[Troll in Flames]] served [[spread bread]], a snack dish that accompanied alcohol. The bread was spread with silverling paste and [[garlic]].
