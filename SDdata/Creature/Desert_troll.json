        "mainbody": "Desert trolls were a species of desert-dwelling trolls, found inhabiting the Calim Desert, and within the Watchers Keep, as well as HarAkir, one of the Domains of Dread.\nDesert trolls were lumbering giants of  or more with tan chameleon-like skin that matched the color of their desert environs between bright sun-bleached sand to dirty colors of rock. Their bodies appeared lanky and awkward, compared to other bipedal creatures. Their feet had only three large flat toes, and their long arms ended in sharp claws. Desert trolls had long, ropey hair that seemingly trembled as if by its own will.\nDesert trolls tended to flee their habitats if their deadly vulnerability to water was discovered by their prey. Most desert trolls were solitary creatures. There was no evidence of desert trolls even being in any sort of alliance or company with other creatures. By nature, these creatures were arrogant and traitorous. All desert trolls dispised water and sought to pollute freshwater sources where they could.\nDesert trolls had abilities similar to those of their more common kin. Their sense of smell was unusually keen. They could swiftly regenerate wounds and parts of their bodies however, unlike regular trolls, they were invulnerable to cold, heat, and fire, keeping only typical acid vulnerability. When trolls suffered damage from acid or flames of magical nature, like dragons breath, their wounds did not heal. They also possessed a more unique vulnerability â€“ to water, as deadly to them as acid, hindering their generative abilities, and a well-aimed blast of water from a decanter of endless water could completely disintegrate a desert troll. Holy water and purified water dealt more damage to these creatures, while a potion of sweet water could immediately kill them. Some desert trolls also moved at a speed higher than their mundane cousins and could only be damaged by magic weapons of +2 or stronger enchantments.\nDue to their natural chameleon skin, trolls were hard to spot in the desert, giving them a great upper hand in springing traps and ambushes on unwary travelers and adventurers. In battle, desert trolls used their claws and bites.\nDeserts, dune burrows, and rocky caves in arid regions were desert trolls homes. They interacted little with other creatures apart from hunting on the far edges of inhabited areas, feeding on travelers, strays, adventurers, In rare occasions when desert trolls had an abundance of food, they were known to form temporary communities of up to a dozen individuals.\nDuring breeding periods of time, a temporary family unit was formed of up to six trolls. These families did not stay together past two years required for the young to mature.\nDesert trolls had no natural predators. Their flesh was unpalatable even to such creatures as leucrotta, and in turn, desert trolls cold hunt most any living creature and could attack some aberrations, like beholders, when starving.\nAccording to the research done by Ibn AlArif sometime in the 14 century DR, desert trolls aquaphobic condition was a mutation caused by magic, or they were created by some mage.\n*Anhg Krag, a goodly desert troll from the realms of HarAkir."
