        "mainbody": "Rukanyrs were a race of aberrations created by the Far Realm warped creatures known as the kaorti, monsters made to destroy the natural order their creators sought to corrupt but could not endure.\nRukanyrs resembled armor-plated,  tall, leafless trees with one thick branch ending in a ball of spikes and jagged spines emerging from the top and several smaller branches ending in grasping claws. One big, black, lidless eye stared out from what would best be described as the front, while at the base of the \"tree\" were three large, toothy maws on stalks. These mouths were placed amid a thick tangle of insectoid limbs.\nDespite their monstrous appearance, rukanyrs had above average intellects and were able to speak the Common language, and yet at the same time were utterly abysmal in regards to not just magnetism (as could be expected) but also wisdom.\nRukanyrs were highly mobile, the many-legged monsters being faster than normal humans, able to effortlessly scale walls, and incredibly difficult to push or trip. They could rake at their enemies with their claws, deliver a potent poison through their bite which reduced the mobility of their foes, slam into their opponents so hard it left them temporarily stunned, and possessed a healing factor that allowed them to recover from simple injuries.\nMost unique of rukanyr traits however was their relation to sound and sundering (and they were notably immune to sound-based effects themselves). Every few dozen seconds or so, rukanyrs could unleash devastating roars from one of their mouths that deafened most creatures within a  diameter, and brought sonic ruin to whatever they made the focus of the attack, breaking their armor and weapons in the process. Their armored plates shifted and rubbed against each other in combat, creating a jarring noise like trees rubbing together in strong winds, and non-blunt weapons were at risk of being caught between the plates, torn from the wielders grasp and damaged if not totally crushed.\nRukanyrs universally began combat by unleashing their sundering roars on the best equipped enemy targets before wading into melee and lashing out with a barrage strikes.\nDespite the express purpose of their creation being destruction, the kaorti were a bit too successful with the rukanyr, as they were destructive to the point the kaorti forbid them from their own enclaves. Instead, they were used to lay waste to areas the kaorti were afraid to enter themselves. A concentration of rukanyrs (they were known to be organized into pairs or bands of 3-8) was almost always a sign that a kaorti enclave was nearby, as their ability to exist in Material Plane settings uninhibited made them ideal guardians for the regions around such a colony.\nOne underground sarrukh temple was known to have a trap which imprisoned whoever triggered it with a rukanyr, keeping both there with six walls of force until either the invaders or the rukanyr were dead.\nIt was believed that kaorti wizards created the first rukanyrs by exposing monstrous scorpions to Far Realm energies."
