'''Stony devils''' were [[hamatula]]s that had willingly become [[mineral warrior]]s.Given that "stony" is the title used for all creatures that became mineral warriors, it could be argued that technically any devil who underwent the process would be a "stony devil".

==Description==
Stony devils resembled hamatulas, being {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighing about {{SI|300|lb}}. They kept the barbing of their original forms, but were now made of living stone, their skin now pebbly and slate-grey and their spines tipped with jagged minerals. Their eyes resembled translucent, semi-precious gemstones, and a foul infernal odor emanated from them.

==Personality==
Stony devils, like other [[baatezu]], were creatures of both [[law]] and [[evil]], but slightly mentally reduced by their transformation into mineral warriors as was standard. They were known to wander the [[Underdark]] in hopes of causing trouble.

==Abilities==
Stony devils possessed most of the abilities of a barbed devil. They retained their unique infernal [[darkvision]], summoning abilities, and [[spell]]-like abilities, although they lost access to ''[[major image]]'' and ''[[hold person]]''. Meanwhile, they gained much from becoming mineral warriors. Their strength and endurance was enhanced, their skin was toughened such that little but adamantine could hope to effortlessly pierce their hides, they became adept burrowers, and once per day they could unleash a particularly vicious strike on a landbound foe. 

==Combat==
Stony devils were eager to fight with their claws and impale their opponents, their melee capabilities only enhanced by the transformation.

==Society==
Stony devils might travel alone, in teams of 2-4, or in squads of 6-10.
