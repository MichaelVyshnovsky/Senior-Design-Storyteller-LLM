The '''mantimera''' was a species derived from crossbreeding a [[manticore]] with a [[chimera]]. Because of this unique breeding, all mantimeras were sterile.

==Appearance==
Mantimeras essentially had the body components of their two parent species. They had the hindquarters of a goat, the forelegs of a [[lion]] and large, bat-like wings of a manticore but also possessed three heads like a chimera. One head was that of a bestial [[humanoid]], similar to a manticore, while the other two were those of a horned goat and a [[chromatic dragon]]. Their tails were flared and barbed at the end like a [[wyvern]], with rows of spikes going up the spine.

==Combat==
Like the chimera, mantimeras preferred to surprise their opponents in combat. They could rake with their claws and whip with or launch spikes from their tail. They also possessed a breath attack from their [[dragon]] head, the color of which determined the breath type.
