A '''werefox''' was a type of [[lycanthrope]] that could take the form of a silver [[fox]] or fox-like hybrid. They were always female, so they were often referred to as '''foxwomen'''.

==Description==
Like all lycanthropes, werefoxes had three forms, called their humanoid, vixen, and fox form- vixen being the term they used for the hybrid form.

In their humanoid form, foxwomen were described as resembling beautiful elven females with silver or silver-streaked hair with a pronounced widow's peak. In the vixen, or hybrid, form, werefoxes retained their elf-like form but with a fox-like head and tail, and silvery fur covering the entire body. In both the humanoid and hybrid forms, werefoxes would wear loose clothing. The third form was that of a large silver fox.

==Personality==
Werefoxes were extremely self-centered, self-serving, hedonistic, and vain. They had no ambitions beyond pampering themselves. Because of their self-centered nature, foxwomen viewed each other as rivals.

==Abilities==
Werefoxes had some few odd abilities, such as infravision, and an exceptional resistance to sleep and charm magic. They also could pass on their curse with their bite, though only in the vixen form. The only major magical gift they possessed was that any and all humanoid (oft listed as "humans, humanoids, and demihumans") males with only average wisdom were magically ''charmed'' by the foxwoman in her humanoid form. In their fox form, a were fox was fast, could ''[[pass without trace]]'', and was easy to loose sight of in underbrush.

Werefoxes, like other lycanthropes, could only be harmed by silver or magicked weapons. Additionally, any scars faded within the month.

==Combat==
Foxwomen could fight with their teeth when in fox or vixen form, while in humanoid form they fought with either sword or bow.

==Ecology==
[[File:Werefox 2e.jpg|thumb|''A werefox, mid-transformation.'']]
Werefoxes inhabited woodlands, making their lairs well away from humanoid communities; these lairs were either well-hidden cottages or cave complexes, and in either case were filled with human comforts. They did not gather in groups, but each foxwoman would be accompanied by a handful of charmed males, preferably human, half-elves, or elves. They did not, however, keep dwarven, halfling, or gnome males around, instead killing them.

The curse of werefox lycanthropy could only be passed to human, half-elven, or elven females; upon acquiring the curse humans would gradually shift to a more elf-like humanoid form, though any odd markings such as tattooes or birthmarks remained. It also left them barren, meaning that foxwomen had to kidnap or adopt children if they wanted them; in such cases they would infect the girl with lycanthropy at a young age. According to some accounts, they preferred to steal elven girls.

The patron deity of werefoxes was the goddess [[Eshebala]].

===Homelands===
In [[Faerûn]] werefoxes could be found in the [[starwood]] region of [[Cormanthor]],<ref> as well as in the cities and villages of [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and the [[Dalelands]].<ref>

In the land of [[Kara-Tur]], they were typically encountered within its temperate forests and swamps.<ref>

==History==
In [[1357]], when the [[Circus of Doctor Trundles]] visited the town of [[Valls]], a foxwoman was among its caged collection of monsters.<ref>
