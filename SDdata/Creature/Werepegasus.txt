A '''werepegasus''' was a type of [[lycanthrope]] that could turn into a [[pegasus]].

==Description==
Werepegasi could transform into their pegasus form from their [[human]] form. A werepegasus could be used as an aerial [[mount]]. These shapechangers were seemingly very elusive, with only one werepegasus known in the [[Realms]]. The only known pegasus was swift-winged and appeared to have the same appearance as a black pegasus.[[Ed Greenwood]] mentioned on the Candlekeep forums that werepegasi were female humans or [[half-elves]] and could shapechange into pegasi of white, blue, or dun hue. However, this contradicts sourcebook material (which mentions the black, male pegasus, [[Thorn]]). See the [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Canon|canon policy]] for more information.

==Notable Werepegasi==
* [[Thorn (werepegasus)|Thorn]], a [[Cormyrian]] bladesmith, and husband of [[Iyrytharna Dantras]].
