        "mainbody": "'''Zoveri''' were a race of aquatic [[humanoid]]s.",
        "Description": "The upper-body of a zoveri resembled that of a fair and beautiful humanoid, slim like an [[elf]] yet finely muscled like a [[human]], while their lower-half was composed of [[octopus]]-like tentacles.",
        "Personality": "Zoveri considered all life to be sacred and because of this they loathed combat of any form. They were widely known for their kindness, going so far as to not even loathe evil creatures. They were readily willing to lend aid to any lifeform that needed it, even those that were evil, though in the latter case they would ''[[Dispel evil|dispel]]'' the creature after aiding it.\n\nThey loved to walk on land, sometimes for long periods, though they would always return to the sea eventually.",
        "Biology": {
            "Reproduction": "Every fall zoveri would migrate to warmer waters, where females would lay thousands of tiny eggs and males would exude sperm to fertilize them. They would then return to their familiar territories, leaving the eggs unguarded. Those who survive always managed to return to their parents, ready to be incorporated into their school."
        },
        "Abilities": "Twice per day, a zoveri could transform themselves into an elf-like form to leave their watery habitat and traverse the land.\n\nZoveri were capable of casting the following [[spell]]s: ''[[bless]]'', ''[[create food and water]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[forget]]'', ''[[fumble]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', and ''[[resist cold]]''. Three times per day they could cast the spells ''[[water breathing]]'' and ''[[water walk]]''. Once per day they could cast the spell ''[[cure disease]]'' and ''[[dispel evil]]''. In addition, they could the spells ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' and ''[[neutralize poison]]'' once a day per individual.\n\nIf four zoveri gathered together in a circle and joined hands, they could perform a ritual to ''[[conjure elemental|conjure an elemental]]''. This ritual involved singing ancient songs of beckoning and performing complex swimming patterns, a sort of underwater dance.",
        "Combat": "When forced to engage in combat, zoveri typically used long metal [[spear]]s that above water they were capable of throwing like [[javelin]]s. However, they were relatively inexperienced combatants.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Zoveri were an omnivorous species. They primarily consumed fish, mollusks, and certain species of seaweed.",
            "Homelands": "Zoveri resided within the plane of [[Seven Heavens]] in its lowest layer, the infinite ocean [[Lunia]].",
            "Relationships": "When traversing the surface world of Mount Celestia, zoveri would mingle with [[petitioner]]s and other [[planar]]s. [[Water elemental]]s were typically known to come to their aid.\n\nZoveri were a [[favored monster]] of the [[Seldarine]] [[deity]] [[Deep Sashelas]]."
