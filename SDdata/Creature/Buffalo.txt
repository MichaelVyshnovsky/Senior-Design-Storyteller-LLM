Buffalo () were a species of uncommon herd animal that were sometimes domesticated by humans.
Buffalo were large and stocky animals that were around  tall. They had a humped back, a pair of small horns, and a small tail.
Buffalo were more intelligent than most other types of herd animals and were the fiercest in combat.
These animals did not flee from combat as often as cattle, sheep, and antelopes, and they often tried to fight off their attackers. Buffalo utilized their horns if approached too closely and could charge from a distance, piercing and stamping over their opponents.
Some buffalo were suited to forest environments, particularly in the Forest Country, which was in the same area as modern day Cormyr, and the wooded hills of Semberholme. In west Faerûn, buffalo were traded in the cities of Manshaka and Keltar, the latter of which was known for its leather market. 
Beyond Faerûn, buffalo were known to dwell in Kara-Tur, especially the water buffalo that lived near the Fenghsintzu River, and in the savannas of Chult.
Velethuil, the leader of the Brighstar clan of elves and the founder of the village of Bristar in the Dalelands, was slain by a forest buffalo.
A buffalo could be summoned by the conjure animals spell.
