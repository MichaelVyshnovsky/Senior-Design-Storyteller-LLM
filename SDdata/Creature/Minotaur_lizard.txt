'''Minotaur lizards''' were a rare, gargantuan species of [[lizard]] named for the [[minotaur]]-like horns atop their heads.

==Behavior==
Minotaur lizards were known to be very aggressive.

==Combat==
Minotaur lizards fought with their sharp teeth and long sharp claws, often ambushing their prey.

==History==
During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some were known to dwell inside the depths of [[Undermountain]].

==Rumors & Legends==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an alleged prophet living in the [[Storm Horns]] was said to use these creatures in their predictions and had trained one of them to do his bidding.

==Ecology==
Minotaur lizards lived largely solitary lives and were most active during daylight hours. Though creatures often feared their horns, they were not known to use them in combat and thus some believed they were a means by which to attract a mate.
===Diets===
Like many species of large lizard, minotaur lizards were carnivorous.
===Habitats===
Minotaur lizards dwelt in the hills and mountains of tropical regions, often near [[red dragon]]s and [[copper dragon]]s.

They inhabited various mountains and hills in the land of [[Maztica]], the southern reaches of the Storm Horns,

Beyond Toril, minotaur lizards could be found on the planet [[Oerth]]. Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], they inhabited the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]'s [[plane]] of [[Qui]].
===Usages===
[[Humanoid]]s used the horns of these creatures for a variety of purposes.
