'''Blueflame ghosts''' were [[spirit]]s that were imprisoned inside blueflame [[magic]] items. Some members of the adventuring group, [[The Nine]], were among the blueflame ghosts.

==Description==
The term came from the magical blue flames that surrounded such ghosts. The owner of an item containing a blueflame ghost was able to call the spirit forth and force it to do their bidding, which was often to kill someone. At least seven blueflame ghosts were known to exist and there may have been many others.

==History==
[[Larloch]] created the blueflame items with the help of the [[Imprisoners]] by binding the spirits of three [[lich]]es to the items. Each of the items possessed its own power when the ghost was imprisoned but the power was dormant when the ghost was outside the item. Part of the [[deity|goddess]] [[Mystra|Mystra's]] power was bound to the items and the [[Simbul]] believed that it may have been possible to bring Mystra back through such items.

==Known Blueflame Ghosts==

* [[Mirt]], a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] was hastily imprisoned inside a blueflame [[axe]] prior to the [[Spellplague]].  In his haste, the [[mage]] failed to bind Mirt to the item. When Mirt was called forth from the axe by the young noble [[Marlin Stormserpent]], he simply fled to [[Suzail]].

* [[Relve Langral]], contained in the [[Flying Blade]], one of The Nine. The blade was an heirloom owned by the [[Stormserpent]] family of Suzail but was taken by [[Cymmarra]]. 

* [[Treth Halonter|Treth Halonter's]] spirit resided in the [[Wyverntongue Chalice]]. It was hidden in the haunted wing of the Royal Palace for many years until [[Marlin Stormserpent]] stole it. The chalice was taken by Cymmarra when she killed Marlin.

===Unnamed Blueflame Ghosts===
* Ghost inside the [[Fang of Baerovus]], which was hidden in the haunted wing of the Royal Palace in [[Suzail]]. [[Targrael]] took the dagger and attempted to use it to heal herself. 

* Ghost inside a belt buckle, which was owned by a noble of [[Cormyr]]. Its name and the spirit contained inside were unknown. [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] and [[Storm Silverhand]] took the buckle and used it to restore the [[Simbul]] to sanity.
