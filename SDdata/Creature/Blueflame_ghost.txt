Blueflame ghosts were spirits that were imprisoned inside blueflame magic items. Some members of the adventuring group, The Nine, were among the blueflame ghosts.
The term came from the magical blue flames that surrounded such ghosts. The owner of an item containing a blueflame ghost was able to call the spirit forth and force it to do their bidding, which was often to kill someone. At least seven blueflame ghosts were known to exist and there may have been many others.
Larloch created the blueflame items with the help of the Imprisoners by binding the spirits of three liches to the items. Each of the items possessed its own power when the ghost was imprisoned but the power was dormant when the ghost was outside the item. Part of the goddess Mystras power was bound to the items and the Simbul believed that it may have been possible to bring Mystra back through such items.
* Mirt, a Masked Lord of Waterdeep was hastily imprisoned inside a blueflame axe prior to the Spellplague.  In his haste, the mage failed to bind Mirt to the item. When Mirt was called forth from the axe by the young noble Marlin Stormserpent, he simply fled to Suzail.
* Relve Langral, contained in the Flying Blade, one of The Nine. The blade was an heirloom owned by the Stormserpent family of Suzail but was taken by Cymmarra. 
* Treth Halonters spirit resided in the Wyverntongue Chalice. It was hidden in the haunted wing of the Royal Palace for many years until Marlin Stormserpent stole it. The chalice was taken by Cymmarra when she killed Marlin.
* Ghost inside the Fang of Baerovus, which was hidden in the haunted wing of the Royal Palace in Suzail. Targrael took the dagger and attempted to use it to heal herself. 
* Ghost inside a belt buckle, which was owned by a noble of Cormyr. Its name and the spirit contained inside were unknown. Elminster and Storm Silverhand took the buckle and used it to restore the Simbul to sanity.
