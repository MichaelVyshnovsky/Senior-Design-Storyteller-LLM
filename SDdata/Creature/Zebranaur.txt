'''Zebranaurs''' were creatures related to [[centaur]]s, with a [[human]]'s upper body and a [[zebra]]'s lower body.The [[Shaar]]yan centaurs described on pages 163—164 of ''[[Shining South]]'' are similar to zebranaurs, in that they are centaurs with a zebra's lower body, but the two creatures are notably distinct in their societal gender roles (Shaaryan centaurs have clearly divided duties between males and females, whereas zebranaurs make no such distinction) and their relationship with wemics (Shaaryan centaurs have an amiable relationship with them, but zebranaurs are avoidant).

==Description==
The human portion of a zebranaur was usually brown-skinned, and the zebra portion was white with black stripes. They commonly had a short, coarse mane made up of black bristles that ran from the middle of the equine back up to the nape of their neck.

==Personality==
==Combat==

Zebranaurs typically fought with [[spear]]s, [[sword]]s, and [[bow]]s. They were particularly adept with the latter weapon, owing to an ancient bowhunting tradition. When fighting unarmed, zebranaurs stomped opponents with their front hooves.

==Society==
In order to improve upon the camouflage granted by their striped lower bodies, it was customary for zebranaurs to paint their human portion with vegetable [[dye]]s in dark stripes or other patterns. These markings, which were added onto annually, signified the individual's achievements, participation in battles, and loves.

Some zebranaur tribes tattooed their foals in coming-of-age rituals, and one tribe in [[South Faerûn]] had developed this practice into a fine art, creating complex patterns and designs incorporating blue, red, and orange ink.

Zebranaurs were sometimes hunted for their decorated pelts, and in certain markets in [[Calimshan]], a lavishly tattooed skin of an adolescent foal's upper back could sell for upwards of 1,000 [[currency|gold pieces]].

Instead of a conventional script, zebranaurs heralded their history with intricate patterns painted on tanned [[leather]]. Despite generally not being able to read or write [[Common]], they did speak the language. Among the more common second languages were [[Goblin language|Goblin]], [[Orc language|Orc]], [[Gnome language|Gnome]], [[Gnoll language|Gnoll]], [[Halfling language|Halfling]], [[Goblin language|Hobgoblin]], and [[Elvish]].

Zebranaurs did not have good relations with [[wemic]]s, and would typically move away whenever a wemic tribe settled into their territory.
