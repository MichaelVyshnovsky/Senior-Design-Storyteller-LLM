        "mainbody": "Stoats were a species of mustelid or \"weasel\", a family of small mammals that included ferrets and weasels.\nLike weasels, these animals were small and slender-bodied furry creatures, measuring  in length from head to tail.\nMuch like ferrets, the fur pelt of a stoat was not considered to be very valuable.\nIn northwest Faerûn, silvered fur stoats could be found in Hartsvale. Beyond Faerûn, stoats inhabited the sub-arctic forests of Kara-Tur.\nSome wizards were known to have stoats as familiars."
