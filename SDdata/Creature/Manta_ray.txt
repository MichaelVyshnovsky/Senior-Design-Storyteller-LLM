Manta rays were large marine animals. 
A manta ray looked like a giant flying wing. They were massive creatures, their mouth alone was up to  in width. And these gaping maws were toothless.
Despite their large size, manta rays were usually peaceful creatures.
The manta rays primary defense was a large stinger at the end of their tail, which inflicted temporary paralysis. Manta rays hunted in shallow areas, hiding on the ocean floor until prey swam into view.
Their diet consisted primarily of plankton and other small creatures. Though some claimed manta rays could swallow an average-sized humanoid whole in one bite.
Beyond the oceans of Toril, manta rays could be found on the planet Krynn.
Manta rays could often be found swimming among giant sea anemones, as they were immune to the effects of their tentacles.
Marids in Zakhara were known to use manta rays as companion animals or servants. One such marid was Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari, who had them in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.
* This animal was the namesake of the cloak of the manta ray, some versions of which could polymorph their wearer into a manta ray.
* A wide variety of aberrations in the Realms had bodies reminiscent of manta rays. These included cloakers, cerebral hoods, lurkers, ixitxachitl, and snowcloaks.
