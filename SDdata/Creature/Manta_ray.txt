'''Manta rays''' were large marine animals. 

==Description==
A manta ray looked like a giant flying wing. They were massive creatures, their mouth alone was up to {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} in width. And these gaping maws were toothless.

==Behavior==
Despite their large size, manta rays were usually peaceful creatures.

==Combat==
The manta ray's primary defense was a large stinger at the end of their tail, which inflicted temporary paralysis. Manta rays hunted in shallow areas, hiding on the ocean floor until prey swam into view.

==Ecology==
Their diet consisted primarily of plankton and other small creatures. Though some claimed manta rays could swallow an average-sized [[humanoid]] whole in one bite.
===Habitats===
Beyond the oceans of [[Toril]], manta rays could be found on the planet [[Krynn]].
===Relationships===
Manta rays could often be found swimming among [[giant sea anemone]]s, as they were immune to the effects of their tentacles.

[[Marid]]s in [[Zakhara]] were known to use manta rays as companion animals or servants. One such marid was [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]], who had them in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].

==Trivia==
* This animal was the namesake of the ''[[cloak of the manta ray]]'', some versions of which could ''[[polymorph]]'' their wearer into a manta ray.
* A wide variety of [[aberration]]s in the Realms had bodies reminiscent of manta rays. These included [[cloaker]]s, [[cerebral hood]]s, [[lurker]]s, [[ixitxachitl]], and [[snowcloak]]s.
