        "mainbody": "Magma drakes were possibly the most powerful of the elemental drakes.\nMagma drakes resembled  dragons with scales that looked like cooling lava and crimson eyes. They were surprisingly agile despite a superficially slow and clumsy appearance.\nMagma drakes were said to be malevolent creatures.\nMagma drakes had an affinity for both earth and fire they could detect creatures that moved on the ground, and could burn enemies with their very touch.\nMagma drakes preferred to attack enemies one at a time, using flight to separate foes from their group if possible, before watching pinned victims burn to death.\nMagma drakes typically lived in deep caverns or volcanic craters, especially those with water nearby. They were known to ally with efreeti and salamanders."
