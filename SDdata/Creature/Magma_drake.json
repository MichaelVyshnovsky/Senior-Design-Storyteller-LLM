        "Personality": "Magma drakes were said to be malevolent creatures.",
        "Abilities": "Magma drakes had an affinity for both earth and fire: they could detect creatures that moved on the ground, and could burn enemies with their very touch.",
        "Combat": "Magma drakes preferred to attack enemies one at a time, using flight to separate foes from their group if possible, before watching pinned victims burn to death.",
        "Ecology": "Magma drakes typically lived in deep caverns or volcanic craters, especially those with water nearby. They were known to ally with [[efreet]]i and [[salamander]]s."
