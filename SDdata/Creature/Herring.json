Simple pan-fried herring was served in Waterdeep's [[Inn of the Dripping Dagger]] for a humble price of four [[copper]] [[coin]]s.\n*Barrel-fulls of picked herring were quite common as well and other preserved fish, including in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].\n*The [[Elfsong Tavern]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] served melted [[cheese]] [[sandwich]]es along with [[pickle]]s, and twists of dried herring.\n*[[Morgan's Inn]] in the city of [[Velen]] prided itself on platefuls of marinated herring with [[celery]] and [[olive]]s, topped with dollops of [[sour cream]].\n\n[[Wizard]]s valued herring as its powdered scales were a [[material component]] of the ''[[secret page]]'' spell."
