        "mainbody": "The '''hangman tree''', also commonly known as a '''gallows tree''', was a rare species of sentient, carnivorous trees found most commonly in temperate to subtropical climates.",
        "Description": "These trees resembled thick [[oak]]s, but with few branches, sparse foliage, and shallow root systems. Knot-like protuberances were present where their sensory organs were, usually high up on their trunks, while the lower trunks displayed a scar-like place for expulsion of indigestibles.\n\nThe name of this species was derived from their sinewy, [[rope]]-like vines, which were said to resemble a hangman's noose. Each hangman tree had six to nine of these, but could only control three of them at any given time. Each could lift creatures weighing no greater than a {{SI|1000|lb|k|long=yes}}. The upper trunk of a hangman tree had an opening where prey was thrown into the \"stomach\" within the barrel of its trunk. This opening was surrounded by sharp growths that pointed down and inward towards its digestive cavity, hindering any attempts of prey to escape.\n\nThe digestive cavity in the barrel of the trunk of the hangman tree was large enough to hold three [[human]]-sized victims and secreted [[acid]] to break down prey.",
        "Personality": "Hangman trees were a rather dimwitted species.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Biology": "Hangman trees moved at very slowly rates. Saplings' were known to move about {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}}, while mature trees could about one-third that rate at a few feet per day.\n\nDuring freezing weather, a hangman tree would typically put down a taproot and down go dormant.  although indigestible items will be expelled from the belly-trunk periodically."
        },
        "Combat": "These trees attacked by dropping their noose-like appendages down around prey. Once in contact with a victim, the vine-like appendage would draw tight and begin lifting the prey up to the upper trunk's opening.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "These trees were carnivorous nature, as their sparse leaves and shallow root systems did not provide them sufficient nutrition.",
            "Habitats": "In [[Cormanthor]], hangman trees could be found in the woodlands between [[Mistledale]] and [[Shadowdale]].<ref> Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], hangman trees could be found in the [[Shadowfell]].",
            "Languages": "Hangman trees could generally speak [[Common]], learning it over many years, but spoke so haltingly."
