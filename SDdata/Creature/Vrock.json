        "Description": "Vrocks stood {{SI|8|feet|c|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|500|pounds|k|long=yes}}, appearing as a cross between a vulture and a [[human]]. Their bodies were twisted and gnarly with a long neck and limbs all covered in sinew. The rest of their body, especially their broad wings, were coated with small gray feathers, and their body stunk of offal and carrion. Their bestial appearance was magnified by their long talons and vulture heads, but burning in their terrifying eyes could be seen a keen, predatory intelligence.<ref name= \"WTAG\" />\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = 350px\n| source = An excerpt from ''The Paladins''\n| text   = ''Their long, pointed talons sank into the hard stone, crushing flat the keen blades of Abyssal flint-like crusty sand. A slime oozed from glands beneath their wings, spreading a film over their thick coats of black and gray feathers. Their wide collars of pinfeathers, shining with mucous, stabbed outward like filthy, curved needles.''\n}}",
        "Personality": "Once thought to be loyal only to their own kind, vrocks turned out to be treacherous even towards each other, betraying their fellows for simple, cheap jewels. They were capricious in the extreme, only working together due to their ability to coordinate, and were well-known for abandoning their jobs and joining with new masters they believed to be more powerful.\n\nVrocks were dull-witted [[demon]]s, but smart enough to keep an eye out for targets.<ref name= \"WTAG\" /> Trying to bribe them was normally a mistake, as they also harbored a strong, demonic bloodlust, relishing the screams of their victims and the taste of humanoid flesh. They saw no reason to accept a bargain when they could simply kill the diplomat, take his treasure, and then have the added benefit of sating their need for carnage and having a fresh meal.",
        "Abilities": "{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = 250px\n| source = A vrock.{{Cite card/Blood Wars}}\n| text   = Vultures we may seem, but scavengers we be not. Now, yield, you do, or begin we will the dance of ruin, and your life you forfeit most painfully.\n}}\n\nA strange set of supernatural abilities aided the vrocks in their violent endeavors. Every now and then vrocks could emit a bloodcurdling screech so loud it caused those nearby physical pain when they heard it, sending them into a short daze. Vrocks could try to summon another vrockÂ or a small legion of [[dretch]]es each day, with limited success for each type. They were reported to have access to the spell-like abilities ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[desecrate]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[mass charm]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''.\n\nWhen a vrocks' wings were shook, small glands scattered across them could release a cloud of tiny spores that would spread about the nearby vicinity and burrow under the skin of those nearby. From that point, they would grow into thick vine-like structures for a short time and poison the victim, eating away at their skin. Poison diminishing magic or the sprinkling of [[holy water]] could stop their effects. If allowed to run its course, assuming the victim survived that long, they stopped causing pain after a few minutes at most, and would wither away in a few days.<ref name= \"WTAG\" />\n\nHowever, the most dreadful ability of the vrocks was their Dance of Ruin. When enough vrocks of a certain combined strength gathered together, generally between 3-5, they could begin a dangerous rite through wild dancing and chanting in an ancient language. With their talons joined together and eldritch screeching filling the air, the vrocks could craft a weave of crackling, lightning-like energy that would engulf the nearby vicinity in a flash of light and destroy everything within several hundred feet.<ref name= \"WTAG\" />",

        "Society": {
            "Relations": "Among other demons, vrocks had a poor relationship with [[chasme]]s, another group of flying tanar'ri. The two mutually hated one another, the chasme seeing the vrocks as rivals. Vrocks also had a bitter feud with [[bulezau]]s, who they rivaled as the toughest front-line troops of the tanar'ri. The bulezaus lacked the magic and mobility of a vrock band, but compensated with sheer stubbornness and fury that led them to never stop fighting. The two bloodthirsty demon breeds would almost inevitably fight upon meeting, unless [[baatezu]] were present for them to attack instead.\n\nBesides demons themselves, vrocks would associate with demonic cults, as well as evil [[fey]] and wicked [[giants]].",
            "Magic": "Vrocks followed a peculiar system when it came to learning magic. No matter how intelligent, individual vrocks couldn't become [[wizard]]s, but a collective of five or more could. The downside of this was that all vrocks had to study a spell before any of them could cast it, but this was compensated for by their increased group adeptness, since a murder of vrocks had the spellcasting strength of some of the most powerful mages."

Freshly killed vrocks, assuming they didn't melt into goop upon death or weren't otherwise destroyed, could be harvested for spores within ten minutes of their demise. Though they didn't have the lingering effects of fresh spores, harvested ones were still a dangerous poison.<ref name= \"WTAG\" />",
        "History": "As unlikely as it might seem, the vrocks were far more reliable than they once were. There was once a race of ancient vrocks more powerful and magically adept than their modern variants that were nearly wiped out two millennia ago. When one of their leaders brought down the wrath of a powerful [[demon lord]] they were practically driven to extinction and supplanted by the more controllable lesser vrocks.{{Cite dungeon/25/The Standing Stones of Sundown|16}}\n\nIn [[882 DR]], Prince [[Simberuel AstalmÃ©]] of [[Ascalhorn]] was killed by vrocks while protecting the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[Forgemaster of Sundbarr]] in the [[Turnstone Pass]].\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], there were at least two vrocks serving [[Matron Mother]] [[Yasraena Dyrr]] of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] in [[Menzoberranzan]]. The vrocks were polymorphed as [[drow]] so as not to cause suspicion.\n\nIn [[1485 DR|1485]]â[[1486 DR]], vrocks were some of the more common demons roaming the streets of Menzoberranzan. They were involved in the failed defense of [[Q'Xorlarrin]] against the dwarves seeking to reclaim [[Gauntlgrym]].",
