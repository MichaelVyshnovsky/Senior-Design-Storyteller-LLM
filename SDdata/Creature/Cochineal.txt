'''Cochineals''' were tiny parasitic [[insect]]s, native to [[Maztica]], notable for their red color.

==Usages==
Cochineals were crushed into a red [[dye]], most commonly used in the production of [[makeup]] for reddening lips and cheeks, as well as fabric dyes.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], powdered cochineal was imported from Maztica and sold all around the Realms via ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. A [[vial]] of {{SI|8|ounce|long=yes}} was sold for 4 [[silver piece]]s.
