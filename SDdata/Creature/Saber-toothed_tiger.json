        "Description": "These creatures were twice as large as any [[lion]]. Their roars were likewise twice as loud as that of any lion. Two large, curved fangs jutted out from their mouths, upon which their name was derived. On average these measured around {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} in length.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were very aggressive and ferocious predators, though were known to sometimes ignore prey that remained motionless.",
        "Combat": "Saber-toothed tigers rarely ever pursued prey over long distances. Often they would attack in groups, ambushing their prey. One half of a pride would startle and chase their prey, steering them straight into the direction of the other half.",
        "History": "In [[640 DR]], the people of [[Ormath]] and [[Lheshayl]], as well as patrols from the [[Shining Plains]], experienced frequent attacks from saber-toothed tigers.<ref name=tGHotR-p93>\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a man in [[Barovia]] by the name of [[Rictavio]] owned a saber-toothed tiger. Around that same time, Queen [[Bjornhild Solvigsdottir]] of the [[Tribe of the Tiger]] had a pet saber-toothed tiger named [[Grava]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Saber-toothed tigers were a carnivorous species.\n\nThese creatures were most often known to prey upon [[giant elk]]s, [[branta]]s, [[glyptodon]]s, [[horse]]s, [[megaloceros]], and [[mammoth]]s.",
            "Habitats": "These creatures were typically found in the forests of either warm or cold climate regions, as well as plains and hills. They laired within caves or small earthen dens when bearing and rearing their young.\n\nSmilodons could be found in the [[Ice Spires]], and much of the [[Savage Frontier]], In the late-15{{th}} century DR, they could be found in the jungles of [[Chult]] near the [[River Soshenstar]], where they were mistaken by locals for a variety of Chultan tiger.<ref>\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], they inhabited the warm marshes and swamps of the planet [[Oerth]].",
            "Relationships": "Saber-toothed tigers were sometimes domesticated by [[neanderthal]]s. In the Ice Spires region, both [[frost giant]]s and the [[Ice Spire ogre]]s of [[Dour Fissure]] were known to have domesticated smilodons.\n\nSome arctic [[ranger]]s were known to have smilodons as [[animal companion]]s.",
            "Usage": "The fangs of smilodons were a source of ivory, primarily fossilized ivory."
        },
        "Trivia": "* The spirit conjured by the ''[[find greater steed]]'' [[spell]] could take the form of a saber-toothed tiger.\n* A saber-toothed tiger could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' spell.<ref>"
