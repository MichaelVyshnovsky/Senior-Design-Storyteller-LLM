A '''fiendish flesh golem''' was a type of [[flesh golem]] that was formed from various [[fiend]]s, namely [[devil]]s, [[yugoloth]]s and [[demon]]s. They were particularly large [[construct]]s, each of which was unique in its design.

The secret to creating fiendish flesh golems was known only to [[night hag]]s and they rarely shared this esoteric knowledge with others.

==Description==
In addition to their monstrous size and unholy appearance, some fiendish flesh golems were made to have wings.

==Combat==
Like many golems, these creatures were [[Magic resistance|resistant]] to [[magic]] and their form could not be changed by any [[arcane]] means. They were also resistant to the elements of cold and fire and were actually healed by electric bolts.

If a fiendish flesh golem received significant damage they went berserk, attempting to attack and damage anyone and anything nearby.
