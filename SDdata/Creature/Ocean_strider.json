        "mainbody": "'''Ocean striders''' were huge aquatic [[fey]] that, as their name suggested, waded through and could even walk on top of large waters. They claimed particular stretches of water, appointing themselves as the protectors of those regions.",
        "Description": "Ocean striders looked like something of a cross between [[elf|elves]] and [[killer whale]]s, possessing the humanoid form and face of an elf, and the rubbery black-and-white patterned skin, sharp teeth, and stubby fluked tail of an orca.",
        "Abilities": "Having both gills and lungs, ocean striders could breathe both above and underwater.\n\nOcean striders could cast ''[[acid fog]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[control water]]'', ''[[elemental swarm]]'' (water only), ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[horrid wilting]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[obscuring mist]]'', and ''[[summon nature's ally IX]]'' (water or aquatic only). Their ability to walk over water functioned as if they were under the constant effect of a ''[[water walk]]'' spell.",
        "Personality": "Although very protective of their territories, ocean striders made a point of warning intruders away before attacking. With promises not to break their rules (which prohibited overfishing and polluting the waters), seafarers could occasionally even negotiate entry into an ocean strider's domain, though the fey would usually continue keeping a close eye on those passing through.",
        "Combat": "When an intruder into their territory waived the ocean strider's established rules or even ignored the creature, it would generally attack. They would typically attack offending ships by ramming directly into them.\n\nOcean striders typically carried masterfully crafted [[falchion]]s and wore [[mithral]] [[scale mail]].",
        "History": "Tales in the [[Nelanther Isles]] told of a cunning [[druid]] named [[Sarian Badgerriver]] who tricked a powerful ocean strider into parting his the enchanted [[scimitar]], later known as the ''[[Prize of the Ocean Strider]]''.",
        "Notable Ocean Striders": "Local legend dictated that an ocean strider acted as the [[Dolphingulf]]'s guardian, though there was no empirical evidence of its existence."
