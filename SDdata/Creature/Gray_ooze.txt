A '''gray ooze''' was a type of [[ooze]], resembling wet stone or rock.<ref  name="MM2e-278">

==Description==
It was a thick puddle of gray sludge, roughly {{SI|8|in|c|long=yes}} thick, {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} wide, and up to {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} across, that closely resembled wet stone or an amorphous rock formation.

==Behavior==
When one of these creatures reached an exceptionally large capacity they were known to mildly develop greater intellect.

==Abilities==
Gray oozes could corrode metal at a rate comparable to that of a [[black pudding]], though its acids could not eat through stone or wood.

When one of these creatures reached an exceptionally large they would develop latent [[psionics]], allowing them to unleash a psychic crush, but in return be left vulnerable to retaliation. They were only known to unleash this ability whenever a creature within {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} of them used psionic powers.

==Combat==
Gray oozes were known to attack in groups, dissolving enemies and absorbing their bones as slime to grow.

Acidic secretions of the gray ooze corroded metal at an alarming rate

==Notable Gray Oozes==
* [[White Maw]], a massive and abnormally intelligent gray ooze that lived in the [[Doomvault]] in [[1486 DR]].

==Ecology==
Gray oozes reproduced by breaking small droplets off of them after a meal, called 'budding', which later grew into gray oozes themselves.<ref  name="MM2e-278"/>
===Habitats===
Gray oozes were known to be found in subterranean areas, such as caverns and [[dungeon]]s. They were mindless scavengers who dragged themselves around caves or [[sewer]]s, while absorbing and digesting whatever they came across.<ref  name="MM2e-278"/> Unlike other oozes, the gray variety couldn't move on ceilings or walls, hence it was left to slide its way along subterranean floors.<ref>{{Cite dragon | issue =169 | date =1991 | pages =6 }}

In the [[Abyss]], gray oozes could be found in [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, [[Layers of the Abyss#222|222nd layer of the Abyss]].
