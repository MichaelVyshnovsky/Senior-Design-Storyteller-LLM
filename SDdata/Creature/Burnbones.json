        "mainbody": "Burnbones were high level members of the Church of Cyric whose mortal frames had been dissolved and transformed from being infused with a portion of his divine power.\nBurnbones had a similar appearance to the blazing bones that were commonly found in Myth Drannor. They typically were seen wearing the symbol of Cyric.\nBurnbones existed only to serve the greater glory of the Prince of Lies, bending to his every whim, suffering insufferable pain and anguish if they ever thought of doing otherwise.\nBurnbones could call upon all the clerical powers they commanded in life at a greater extent of efficiency."
