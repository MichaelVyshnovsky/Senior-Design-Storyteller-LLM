'''Lamias''' were a type of shapechanging [[fey]] that appeared in the Realms in the period between the [[Spellplague]] and [[Second Sundering]].

==Description==
In their true form, lamias were swarms of black [[scarab beetle]]s with a collective consciousness,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Love|4}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Vesperin Initiative|26-27}} These swarms molded themselves around the bones of powerful fey creatures to form a coherent shape, then used their powers to disguise themselves as an attractive [[humanoid]]. They could take on the form of any race or gender, though typically took on the form of either [[eladrins]], [[drow]], or [[human]]s.

==Personality==
Though made up of a swarm, lamias were highly intelligent collective consciousnesses that possessed some of the memories and knowledge of their first victim. Some were driven by a need to consume other sentient beings, whilst others craved knowledge and would go to any length to acquire magical power and [[arcane magic|arcane]] lore.

==Abilities==
In addition to being able to change their shape at will, lamias could stun other creatures or drain life-force by touching them.

==Society==
Every time a lamia slayed a humanoid, another beetle or equivalent creature manifested in their swarm. Eventually a lamia's swarm would grow too large and they would be forced to reproduce. This was done by slaying a powerful fey creature, then dividing itself between its current body and the new corpse. The filled corpse was gradually eaten from the inside out and then arose as a new lamia, retaining some of the victim's memories and knowledge.

Lamias often enslaved other, weaker creatures to act as their bodyguards and minions.

===Languages===
Lamias generally spoke both [[Common]] and the [[Elven language]].

==Notable Lamias==
* [[LeShanna]], a lamia that could shapechange into a mass of spiders and ruled an area of the Feywild known as the [[Spiderwood]].
* [[Joella]], daughter of the lamia LeShanna, who worked for the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] to sabotage the formation of the [[Velerian Trade Alliance]].
