Lamias were a type of shapechanging fey that appeared in the Realms in the period between the Spellplague and Second Sundering.
In their true form, lamias were swarms of black scarab beetles with a collective consciousness, These swarms molded themselves around the bones of powerful fey creatures to form a coherent shape, then used their powers to disguise themselves as an attractive humanoid. They could take on the form of any race or gender, though typically took on the form of either eladrins, drow, or humans.
Though made up of a swarm, lamias were highly intelligent collective consciousnesses that possessed some of the memories and knowledge of their first victim. Some were driven by a need to consume other sentient beings, whilst others craved knowledge and would go to any length to acquire magical power and arcane lore.
In addition to being able to change their shape at will, lamias could stun other creatures or drain life-force by touching them.
Every time a lamia slayed a humanoid, another beetle or equivalent creature manifested in their swarm. Eventually a lamias swarm would grow too large and they would be forced to reproduce. This was done by slaying a powerful fey creature, then dividing itself between its current body and the new corpse. The filled corpse was gradually eaten from the inside out and then arose as a new lamia, retaining some of the victims memories and knowledge.
Lamias often enslaved other, weaker creatures to act as their bodyguards and minions.
Lamias generally spoke both Common and the Elven language.
