The '''archdevils''' were powerful, unique [[devil]]s. The most powerful archdevils were the '''Lords of the Nine'''.

|Why, what need have you for a tongue when we can converse in your mind? I can gouge out your eyes and tear out your every organ — even dine on your liver, say, with sauce and salt — and then restore you with my magic. You think small, man! This is Hell, and here archdevils can do anything! ...Well, then, let us say anything another archdevil does not manage to prevent, hmm?

==Hierarchy==
The position of archdevils in the hierarchy of [[Baator]] was clear: archdevils were the most powerful and were, therefore, on top. The most powerful of the archdevils were the archdukes, also called the '''Lords of the Nine'''. Other archdevils were dukes, ruling portions of a layer, generals, or bureaucrats of various sorts.<ref> Each used the unique qualities of their layer to keep its essential nature pure of [[chaos]].

==Powers==
The presence of an archdevil twists and warps the layer over which they rule to be closer to what they themselves embody.{{Cite dragon/223/The Lords of the Nine|11}}

==Other Archdevils==
Of course, due to the nature of politics in the Nine Hells, archdevils wound up exiled or dead at various times. Some exiles remained in the Nine Hells (such as Geryon and his court, listed above), while others were forced to leave completely.

Additionally, the dragon goddess [[Tiamat]] spent some time as an archdevil after her Untheric aspect was killed. She was ruler of Avernus during some of her time there.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|title=Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|topicid=19841|postid=464818|whichpage=7|date=2015-02-12|accessdate=2015-02-16}} Another archduke that wasn't an archdevil was [[Malagard]] the Hag Countess, who ruled Malbolge before Glasya. She was actually a supremely powerful [[night hag]], rather than a devil.<ref><ref>

===Deceased Archdevils===
{{fq
| text   = Archdevils may be slain, but it's not easy to destroy us forever. The lord of Nessus must burn away some of his power to bring about such a doom. He's done it, yes — but  only in punishment for the most deadly doing that could be launched against him: archdevil lying with archdevil to have offspring they hide from Asmodeus, to bring to Hell an archdevil the Lord Below knew not.
