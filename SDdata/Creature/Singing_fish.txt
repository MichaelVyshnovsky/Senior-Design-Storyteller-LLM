'''Singing fish''' was a species of [[fish]] found in the [[Akanamere]] of the [[Akanal]].

==Ecology==
===Usages===
These fish were consumed in the coastal city-states of the [[Blade Kingdoms]], such as [[Sumbria]], [[Kirenzia]], [[Zutria]], [[Lomatra]], and [[Lotoli]]. The fish was considered a fanciful treat and was served in the [[Palace of Manniccis]] during the [[Festival of Blades]], alongside whole-roasted [[ostrich]]es, sweetened [[orange]] rinds, [[hamster]]s in sauce, and copious amounts of local [[wine]]s.
