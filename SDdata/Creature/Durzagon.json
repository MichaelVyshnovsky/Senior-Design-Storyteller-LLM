        "Description": "Slightly taller and leaner than average duergar, durzagon stood about {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall. They were usually bald with a wiry, gray, red-streaked beard and rust-colored skin that radiated noticeable levels of heat. They had razor-sharp claws and teeth strong enough to pierce skin.",
        "Personality": "Not every durzagon was aware of their infernal heritage since devils normally kept their true identity secret from their duergar mates. Durzagons made aware of their origin typically kept such knowledge secret from enemies and allies alike.",
        "Abilities": "Durzagons possessed both the natural abilities of duergar and magical powers granted from their fiendish heritage. They could create [[darkness]] three times per day, [[Enlarge/reduce|enlarge]] themselves, and turn [[invisibility|invisible]]. A durzagon's beard held quills that contained a sulfuric poison that physically weakened foes. Despite their duergar traits, durzagons truly were outsiders and could not be resurrected.",
        "Combat": "While they typically cast spells from behind their duergar bodyguards, durzagons thoroughly enjoyed melee combat and when physically engaged with an opponent they would fearlessly fight to the death.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Despite being fiends, most durzagons still worshiped [[Laduguer]]."
        },
        "History": "Durzagon were among the forces of the duergar city of [[Gracklstugh]] during the duergar attack on [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1372 DR]]."
