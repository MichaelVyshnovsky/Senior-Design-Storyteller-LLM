        "mainbody": "Half-gnolls were humanoids with both human and gnoll ancestry.\nMost half-gnolls were large muscular beastmen with wild fur and yellowed teeth. Many half-gnolls had monstrously large canine eyes and snouts like a hyena which ended with a human nose and pink lips.\nEven though these monsters acted and lived with gnolls, they seemed to think with human intelligence.\nIn battle, many half-gnolls wielded large swords and rusty daggers.\nThese abominations were very rare, but a few had been seen in Phlan around the Moonsea area."
