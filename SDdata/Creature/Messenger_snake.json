        "mainbody": "Messenger snakes were a type of flying snake that were specifically bred by the Zhentarim. They were not a naturally occurring species, rather the product of magical experimentation.\nAbout  long in length, these snakes were covered in metallic green scales. While they closely resembled the aerial serpents native to Chult, they had the distinction of having feathered wings that were similar to those of a parrot.\nWhile they were often tasked with carrying written messages or parcels, up to  in weight, they could also recite up to one hundred words per assignment.\nThey flew with near silence and possessed a potent form of camouflage that was effective even in flight.\nMessenger snakes were capable of understanding and mimicking basic human languages. To aid them in their duties, they were imbued with the powers to readily locate their desired locations and uncover any falsehoods while speaking with others.\nAs of the , newly hatched messenger snakes were worth about 2,500 gp. Their eggs were valued upwards of 1,000 gp.\nMessenger snakes were most commonly found near settlements and strongholds occupied by Zhents and agents of the Zhentarim.\nBeyond their use by the Zhentarim, messenger snakes were a favored monster of the deity Vergadain and often served him.\nBeyond their namesake purpose of carrying messages and parcels, messenger snakes were known to be eaten in the land of Thar and considered to be quite a delicacy.\nIt was rumored that after their inception messenger snakes developed heightened intelligence and even formed a language of their own."
