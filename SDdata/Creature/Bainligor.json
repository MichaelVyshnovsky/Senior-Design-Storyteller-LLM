        "mainbody": "'''Bainligor''' were a race of small, flightless, [[bat]]-like [[humanoid]]s that inhabited the southern reaches of the [[Upperdark]],\n{{Cite dragon/227/The Dragon's Bestiary: Monsters of the Underdark|21}} particularly the areas beneath the [[Chultan Peninsula]].",
        "Description": "Bainligors possessed huge pointed ears, ridged snouts, and elaborately sculpted facial features that all together gave them a resemblance to bats. The average height of a bainligor ranged from {{SIrange|3|6|ft}}.",
        "Abilities": "Bainligor utilized a form of echolocation, allowing them to hunt in darkness and making them immune to all visual illusions and [[spell]]s such as ''[[blindness]]'', ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'', and ''[[invisibility]]''. Though they could be blinded by a ''[[deafness]]'' spell. Their chirps weren't audible for most [[demihuman]]s and humanoids, though [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s could hear them quite well and warn of their presence. Once per hour bainligor could weaponize their echolocation, emitting a burst of ultrasonic sound that could stun and potentially even permanently deafen a creature.\n\nAs  bainligor aged they underwent a series of [[magic]]al transformations, growing larger throughout their lives, as well as their teeth and claws becoming magically strengthened with each growth spurt. The bainligor lifecycle ended when they became compelled in old age by an inner voice to seek out a dry, empty cavern, where they may transform into an [[undead]] form of bainligor referred to as Revered Ones. A small percentage of these were known to become [[spellcaster]]s after making this transition to undeath.\n\nElderly bainligor were capable of transforming other creatures into undead once per month, turning bainligor into Revered Ones and other creatures into [[zombie]]s. However, they would never do this to members of their own kind unless there was a danger of overcrowding, starvation, or death by poison gas or drowning.{{Cite dragon/227/The Dragon's Bestiary: Monsters of the Underdark|22}}",
        "Combat": "Besides their ultrasonic bursts, bainligor fought with their claws and needle-like teeth. They typically attacked in large groups, hoping their combined efforts would quickly pull down any prey.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "The bainligors were omnivorous scavengers. They subsisted almost entirely upon a diet of edible [[fungi]], [[roth√©]], [[spider]]s, various insects, and even rotting flesh if necessary. The eating of noxious foods in particular was a source of boasting for bainligor.",
            "Languages": "The bainligor were capable of communicating in [[Undercommon]], though their high-pitched voices made it difficult for other races to properly hear them, even if they lowered their voice to be heard.",
            "Relationships": "Due to the language barrier imposed by their physiology, bainligors rarely spoke with other races and engaged little in trade."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Bainligor legends speak of a group of dozens of bainligors called the \"Deep Tribes\", composed entirely of Revered Ones, who were said to have purposely starved themselves into that state. The Deep Tribes were said to hunt in great groups in the deeper reaches of the Underdark, not for nourishment but to simply revel in their strength and the fear they instilled in other beings. The Deep Tribes were believed to be likely nothing more than a legend, as there had never been any confirmed sightings by the sages and savants of other Underdark races."
