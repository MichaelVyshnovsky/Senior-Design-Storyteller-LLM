'''Giant boring beetles''' were a species of giant [[beetle]] that could form an intelligent hive mind with others of the same species, and its ability to bore.<ref group="note">Note that the beetle was named after its ability to bore through organic material, not that it was uninteresting.

==Description==
Boring beetles were common creatures, but had animal intelligence, unlike other beetles, which were non-intelligent. They were approximately {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Behavior==
Being smarter than other giant beetles, groups of boring beetles developed a communal intelligence that generated a level of consciousness and reasoning ability like that of a [[human]] brain. Due to this level of collective intelligence, they could collect treasure and magical items.

==Combat==
They used their large mandibles in combat to inflict powerful bites upon their victims.

==Ecology==
These creatures were typically found in groups of up to eighteen members.
===Diet===
Giant boring beetles were an omnivorous species that primarily fed upon rotting wood and other organic material. If in areas devoid of organic material, they intelligently grew cultures of molds, [[slime]]s, and [[fungus|fungi]] for food.
===Habitats===
These creatures could be found in almost any type of environment,{{Cite dragon/54/Ruins|11}}

In [[the North]] they could be found in the [[Midwood]] area of [[Cormanthor]], as well as in the forests of [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and the [[Dalelands]]. In [[northeast Faer√ªn]], they could be found in [[Vaasa]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|61}}

In the region of [[Kara-tur]], giant boring beetles could be found in the forests of [[Akari|Akari island]]. And in the [[Zakhara]] region's [[Crowded Sea]], they could be found on the [[Djinni's Claws]].

Beyond [[Toril]], these beetles could be found within the Underdark of the planet of [[Krynn]].

===Relationships===
The fungal farms that giant boring beetles cultivated served purposes beyond nutrition. For example, [[shrieker]] fungi functioned as nest alarms, which alerted the collective hive-mind when intruders came into their home. When triggered, the beetles reacted very quickly to such alarms, swarming the intruders. After the battle, the boring beetles took the remains of their enemies and either ate them, or used the organic material to raise saprophytic plants.

==Trivia==
A giant boring beetle could be summoned to the caster's aid with the ''[[monster summoning III]]'' [[spell]].<ref>
