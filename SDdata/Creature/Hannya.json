        "first": "",
        "mainbody": "'''Hannya''' ({{Pronounce|hah|nya|refs=}}) were eastern cousins to ordinary [[hag]]s, native to [[Kara-Tur]]. Like the sinister serpentines known as the [[yuan-ti]], they were former [[human]]s that made a pact with dark forces to permanently alter themselves.",
        "Description": "Hannyas were {{SI|7|ft}} long overall, but their upper and lower halves were obviously distinct. Their upper halves resembled skinny, decrepit crones with sickly green skin cloaked in black or grey peasant clothing that was often torn and filthy. Their lower halves meanwhile were those of thick, limber snakes with cold, thin scales of green or black complexion.\n\nBlack beady eyes covered in a white film sat above their long, hooked noses and behind their yellow fangs laid a serpentine tongue. When stirred, either from excitement or annoyance, they spoke in a series of stuttering sibilance, sprinkled with long, shrill cackling. Sharp claws tipped their long, bony fingers and their hunched shoulders were covered by greasy, curly, dark hair.",
        "Personality": "Already bitter and malicious before their transformation, hannya were no less wicked afterwards. They were devious and vicious with a predatory mindset, relishing the pain of others with sadistic delight but only preying on those incapable of defending themselves.",
        "Abilities": "The muscled, lower half of a hannya could constrict their foes like a giant boa, her grip increasingly tightening around her victim even without her teeth and claws sinking in. They could also ''[[polymorph self|polymorph]]'' themselves, ''[[detect thoughts]]'', and implant ''[[suggestion]]''s in minds up to {{SI|100|ft}} away, although not to those that knew of their true nature or who otherwise viewed them as a threat.\n\nThe other weakness of the hannya was their utter aversion to [[violet]]s. Those holding bouquets of violets were immune to their spells and they refused to touch anyone holding them nor enter buildings surrounded by them.",
        "Combat": "Hannya were pitiless fighters but only attacked those weaker than themselves. Against stronger opponents or those of equal ability, they took any and all opportunities to escape. Upon finding a proper target, like a lost child or journeying priest, they would polymorph into a kindly-looking, elderly woman and behave pleasantly towards them.\n\nThey would then seed a suggestion compelling the soon-to-be victim to trust them or at the very least lower their guard, such as that a lonely crone would desire company or might need help. At other times, they appealed to more pragmatic thinking and suggested that they could offer food and shelter or would use some form of treasure as bait and suggest its presence to nearby wanderers. If the target was holding violets, she would non-magically request that they put the flowers down for some reason, such as saying she was allergic or that she wanted to admire them from a vase. After the victim was appropriately vulnerable they would waste no time before savaging them.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Hannyas spoke yuan-ti and other reptilian languages like [[Draconic]], as well as [[Common]] and tongues typical to their local regions."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Hannya would consume any kind of meat, but preferred the flesh of [[humanoid]]s and had an insatiable taste for that of humans."
        }
