        "mainbody": "Ustilagors () were the larval stage of the development of intellect devourers.\nUstilagors were said to be the size and shape of a human brain, covered in a grey fungal growth and with four short, spindly legs. A pair of , ribbon-like tendrils sprouted from the front end.\nUstilagors were essentially mindless.\nDespite their mindlessness, ustilagors possessed deadly psionic abilities. They were reported to either be able to psionically induce a strong aversion to fungus in a creature within , and to be able to telempathically project a different emotion into a creatures mind. Other reports more simply said that ustilagors could use aversion, detect psionics, energy adaptation, id insinuation, and telempathic projection at will, and body adjustment thrice each day.\nThe tendrils of ustilagors were coated in a corrosive and toxic alkaline fluid. The fungal growth on the body was actually a symbiotic organism that kept it from drying out, safe from cerebral parasites, and safe from certain attacks by fungal creatures (such as spores, poisons, etc.).\nthumb|Slithering ustilagors.\nDespite being considerably weaker than their adult forms, ustilagors were patient hunters that could follow their prey for several hours before attacking. They hunted in small packs and attacked their victims by robbing them of their thoughts, slowly hazing and confusing their minds.\nUstilagors were found underground either alone or in small pods of up to three individuals. Illithids raised ustilagors for food, and sometimes allowed an ustilagor to reach adulthood, using intellect devourers as guards.\nThey were considered a delicacy by the mind flayers of Oryndoll. The Thrall Market sold ustilagors to visitors for high prices in several varieties such as raw, pickled, or seasoned with fungi."
