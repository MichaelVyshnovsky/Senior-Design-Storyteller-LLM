'''Noble marids''' were powerful masters of the oceans.

==Description==
Noble marids had pearls for teeth and currents for muscles, making them the strongest and handsomest of all [[genie]]kind. Their hair was usually dark grey or blue-black. These genies could assume gaseous (fog), liquid (rushing current), and solid (gigantic [[humanoid]]) forms.

Both sexes wore the most expensive clothes and jewels that they could afford. They enjoyed intimidating others with their impressive physiques.

==Combat==
Noble marids could cast the following [[spell]]s as if they were highly powerful [[archmages]]: ''[[detect evil and good]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[assume liquid form]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[purify water]]'', ''[[gaseous form]]'', ''[[part water]]'', ''[[lower water]]'', ''[[wall of fog]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', ''[[airy water]]'', ''[[control weather]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[solid fog]]'', ''[[water blast]]'', and ''[[maelstrom]]''. 

All noble marid had the innate ability to walk on water.

Noble marids were comfortable at any water temperature and were immune to any water- and most cold-based attacks. Steam did not affect them. They were more susceptible to fire-based attacks.

==Habitat/Society==
Noble marids served the [[Great Padisha of the Marids]] directly. Most schemed to rule upon her death. Noble marids usually ignored their [[Marid|lesser cousins]] unless they believed a direct benefit could be achieved to boost their standing in the court, called the [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].

Noble marids traveled in groups that included other noble marids, marids, sea creatures, [[dragon turtle]] mounts, and other servants from the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].

Marid war parties were led by one noble marid.

==Ecology==
Noble marids impacted the other races less than other noble genies since they viewed other beings as inconsequential. Noble marids focused on themselves and had little time for anything else.

Noble marids who were enslaved by [[sha'ir]]s stopped at nothing to get revenge against the sha'ir upon gaining their freedom.
