        "mainbody": "'''Ice trolls''' were a type of [[troll]] that inhabited the cold north.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|294}}",
        "Description": "Ice trolls stood about {{SI|8|ft}} tall and weighed around {{SI|400|lbs.|k}}. They had sickly translucent white skin and if someone got close enough without being eaten they could see pale blood coursing underneath an ice troll's skin.",
        "Biology": "Much like the [[scrag]], the regenerative abilities of ice trolls would only function when their bodies were immersed in water. Because of this, their lairs were typically found near lakes or rivers.\n\nIce trolls typically mated in the springtime and gave birth around the fall.",
        "Behavior": "Compared to other troll species, the ice trolls were highly cooperative in order to ensure each other's survival. They were also generally smarter than most troll species and preferred the use of weapons over their fists.\n\nThey did demonstrate the same insatiable hunger and cruel disposition as their temperate-climate cousins.",
        "Combat": "Some ice trolls were known to fight with [[scale armor]] and [[maul]]s.{{Cite dungeon/162/Winter of the Witch|51}} Though in some cases they were also known to spit out globs of freezing slime at their enemies.",
        "History": "In [[1480 DR]], ice trolls living in the [[Icespire Peak]] were gathered together with a number of other frost creatures by the legendary [[frost giant]] [[Hrimnir]] as part of his campaign to acquire the [[Winterforge]]. Those that fought for him seemed to be especially motivated to engage in cruelty and violence.\n\nLater in the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], a great deal of ice trolls in the North were working under [[Storvald|Jarl Starvald]].<ref>",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Ice trolls were commonly found in the [[Unapproachable East]], along the [[Spine of the World]], on the [[Great Glacier]], and in the Icespire Peak. In the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], they were often known to lair inside ancient ice-locked ships.<ref>\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], ice trolls were typically found in the [[Frostfell (plane)|Frostfell]], the [[Iron Wastes]], and other places where supernatural cold resided.{{Cite dungeon/162/Winter of the Witch|59}}",
            "Religion": "On the Prime Material plane, some tribes of ice trolls were known to worship the archfey Koliada.",
            "Relationships": "The ice trolls that lived in the Icespire Peak had a long history of collaborating with their local frost giants, enjoying the carnage and carrion that accompanied their raiding parties.",
            "Usages": "The blood of ice trolls was often utilized by other races in the manufacturing of ''[[frostbrand]]s'' and ''[[ring of resistance|rings of cold resistance]].''\n\nTheir hearts could be removed from a troll's body as long as their regeneration was nullified. The heart was continuously cold after its removal, and offered a form of ''regeneration'' upon its consumption. If an ice troll's heart was planted into the earth, it would conjure forth a vicious blizzard that would last for a matter of hours. It could also be used to formulate a ''[[potion of cold resistance]]''.\n\nSome [[hag]]s were known to perform rituals on their hearts, turning them into magical talismans with an effect similar to [[brown mold]]."

        "Rumors & Legends": "''Circa'' 1480 DR, there was a rumor spread among the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Icehammer]] that the ice trolls in Icespire Peak were hearing the voice of [[Thrym]] whispering along the mountain winds."
