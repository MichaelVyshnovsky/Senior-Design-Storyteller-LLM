A '''qullan''' was a rare creature, resembling a tall and muscular humanoid covered in scars and warpaint.

==Description==
Qullans were heavily muscular humanoids that stood over {{SI|8|ft}} tall. They rarely wore armor; they often roamed naked or in clothes fashioned from the pelts of [[tiger]]s. Qullans prided themselves on their battle scars, often enhancing such former wounds with warpaint.

==Behavior==
Qullans were a tribal species and seemed to be isolationist. Making contact with qullans often proved impossible. They had incredible concentration, allowing them to resist even the most brutal tortures.

Forcing a qullan to do something atypical, or ''[[charm]]ing'' them, would cause a "feedback" effect on the one wishing to communicate with the qullan, killing them.

==Combat==
These humanoids typically fought with [[broadsword]]s. These were renowned for their incredible sharpness, which had not been replicated throughout the [[Realms]]. But despite their power, these swords easily blunted.

As well as honing great physical prowess, qullans continuously emitted rays of ''[[confusion]]'', causing anyone coming close to the creatures to either stand on the spot, or attack a nearby creature, either friend or foe, if they could not resist the rays.

Many qullans were proficient in producing and utilizing poisons, which they made into darts and fired through [[blowpipe]]s. Such potent poisons would bring death to their target, unless those of incredible holy power intervened.

==Society==
===Relationships===
Due to their isolationist ways, making contact with qullans often proved impossible.

[[Dakon]] were known to hold great hostility towards qullan. This often resulted in violent conflicts with them and their [[banderlog]] allies.{{Cite dragon/187/Ecology of the Dakon|26-27}}

==Notable Qullans==
* [[Tee-a-nicknick]], a half-qullan that plotted to assassinate Captain [[Deudermont]] in [[Luskan]].
