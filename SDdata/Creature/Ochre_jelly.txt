An '''ochre jelly''' ({{Plural|jellies}}) was a dangerous variety of [[ooze]].

==Description==
Ochre jellies resembled giant amoebas, dark yellow in color. A mature ochre jelly reached up to {{SI|15|feet|long=yes}} in diameter and around {{SI|6|inch|c|long=yes}} thick. However, it could compress its mass to fit through gaps of only {{SI|1|inch|c|long=yes}}. Moreover, it had a mass of {{SI|5600|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Combat==
They lurked in dungeons, slowly creeping along floors, walls, and ceilings and under and through doors and cracks looking for victims. When they were found, the ochre jelly extended itself and latched onto a victim, proceeding to constrict and engulf them. The jelly exuded pseudopods to slam and grapple foes in combat.

==Ecology==
If cut, an ochre jelly could split into two similar, but smaller, offspring.

===Habitats===
Ochre jellies were known to exist in the dungeon of [[XÃ»l-Jarak]] in [[Thar]]. They could also be found in the ruins of the [[Ulcaster]] school near [[Beregost]].

In the [[Abyss]], ochre jellies could be found in [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, the [[Layers of the Abyss#222|222{{nd}} layer of the Abyss]].

==Significance==
They were favored by the [[drow]] deity [[Ghaunadaur]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}
