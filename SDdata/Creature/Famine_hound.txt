Famine hounds were a variety of undead dog that existed in the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering. They arose from the bodies of dogs that had been abandoned and left to die of starvation.
Famine hounds had gaunt, hollow bodies.
Like most undead, they were resistant to harm from necrotic energy and vulnerable to radiant energy.
Around the late 15 century DR, a human necromancer from the Bleak Academy was operating in Tymanther, in an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke, creating a number of undead deep within a mausoleum.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus in the mausoleum, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. Three of these undead were famine hounds, which fought to protect the necromancer when a group of adventurers invaded his lair to rescue the kidnapped dwarf Melnar.
Like many undead dogs, famine hounds were drawn towards cemeteries and other places of death. They sometimes raided towns, though preferred to live on the fringes and pick off hapless travelers. Having died of starvation, these undead had an endless hunger for the flesh of the living.
