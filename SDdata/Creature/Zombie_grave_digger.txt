'''Zombie grave diggers''' were a variant of [[zombie]]s that existed in the period between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]]. They were created by [[necromancer]]s to replace the mortal helpers that were usually hired to carry out the manual labor aspects of acquiring raw materials for [[necromancy]], though in a pinch could also serve as impromptu bodyguards. As befitting their purpose, they were typically created from the corpses of failed grave robbers.{{Cite dragon/371/Creature Incarnations: Zombies|48}}

==Description==
These zombies were always dressed in darkly colored work attire. They always had a variety of tools on hand to aid them in the task of robbing graves, such as [[hammer]]s, [[spade]]s, [[prybar]]s, and a hefty [[shovel]]. Both their flesh and these various tools were always found to be encrusted in grime in dirt from the graves they despoiled.

==Abilities==
Like other zombies they were resistant to harm from [[necrotic energy]], but vulnerable to [[radiant energy]].

==Combat==
Rather than using their teeth and bare fits, these zombies fought with their hefty shovels and would attempt to blind foes by flinging filth or rotting bits of themselves. They tended to prioritize attacking individuals that matched the description of body types they were ordered to collect. When operating in groups, one of them would focus on escaping with the body while the others remained behind to guard the fleeing zombie's rear. 

==History==
Around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[human]] necromancer from the [[Black Academy|Bleak Academy]] was operating in [[Tymanther]], in an ancient [[Unther]]i burial site near [[Ruinspoke]]. Deep within a mausoleum at the burial site, the necromancer created a number of undead through use of the [[spell]] ''[[undead servitor]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|5}}<ref group="note" name="Unther">It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or [[Tymanchebar]]. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a [[Lathander]]ite sarcophagus in the mausoleum, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. One of these undead was a zombie grave digger, which confronted a group of [[adventurer]]s in the graveyard outside the tomb when they came to rescue the missing [[dwarf]] [[Melnar]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|10}}
