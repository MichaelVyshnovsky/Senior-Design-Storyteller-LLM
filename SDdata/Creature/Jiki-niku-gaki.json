        "mainbody": "'''Jiki-niku-gaki''' ({{Pronounce|jee|kee|nee|koo|gah|kee|refs=}}) were evil lesser spirits native to [[Kara-Tur]]. They were the most common type of [[gaki]].",
        "Description": "Jiki-niku-gaki resembled emaciated humanoids, with dry, peeling skin. They had yellow fangs, sharp claws and deep set eyes.",
        "Combat": "Jiki-niku-gaki were vicious fighter. In combat, they attacked quickly and without mercy, using their sharp claws and teeth to kill an opponent. While jiki-niku-gaki were ambush predators, their overwhelming urge to feed often drove them to attack openly or recklessly.",
        "Abilities": "Like all gaki, Jiki-niku-gaki had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[become invisible]]'' and ''[[polymorph]]'' spells at will, and ''[[passwall]]'' three times daily. They were immune to all charm, hold and sleep spells, as well as ''[[drowsy insect]]''. They were vulnerable to any spell that affected spirits. Jiki-niku-gaki were able to fly and slowly regenerated damage that was inflicted upon them.",
        "Society": "Although jiki-niku-gaki were solitary creatures, they occasionally lived in small groups. These groups were usually associations they had in their past lives.",
        "Habitat": "Jiki-niku-gaki did not have a lair. Rather they were always moving from place to place, hunting for food. They were most often encountered on isolated roads or trail, or within cemeteries.",
        "Ecology": "Jiki-niku-gaki were carnivores and consumed the flesh of their victims. Some jiki-niku-gaki however had the ability to consume color or scent. These jiki-niku-gaki fed on color and scent from up to {{SI|20|ft}} from their victim, feeding on it while ''invisible''. The color of a victims clothing faded or lost their aroma or [[perfume]]. Once the color or scent was drained, sometimes the jiki-niku-gaki would then physically attack the victim, their hunger not sated. If the jiki-niku-gaki was killed, the color and scent was restored within a day.\n\nLike all gaki, jiki-niku-gaki were the reincarnated spirits of wicked people. They were reincarnated as gaki for punishment for living a life of evil and sin."
