        "mainbody": "Abyssal widows were servants of Lolth, acting as her handmaidens and midwives. They guarded the gate to the Demonweb Pits.\nThey appeared as female drow of astounding and unblemished beauty with eight spindly arachnid legs protruding from their sides, keeping them from touching the floor. The wizard Pharaun noted that their beauty was transfixing, to the point that he thought the first one he saw was Lolth herself.\nThey could also hang upside down from the ceiling, just like a spider could.\nEven among drow priestesses, they were a myth, and others didnt even know they existed. They acted as handmaidens (presumably along with the yochlols) and as midwives and guardians. Their existence was prophesied, and when the Silence of Lolth came to an end, they came into existence. They were seen guarding the gate from the ruined temple of Lolth in the Abyss to the new Demonweb Pits."
