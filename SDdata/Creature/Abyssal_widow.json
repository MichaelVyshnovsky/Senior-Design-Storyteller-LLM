        "Description": "They appeared as female [[drow]] of astounding and unblemished beauty with eight spindly arachnid legs protruding from their sides, keeping them from touching the floor. The wizard [[Pharaun Mizzrym|Pharaun]] noted that their beauty was transfixing, to the point that he thought the first one he saw was Lolth herself.\n\nThey could also hang upside down from the ceiling, just like a spider could.",
        "History": "Even among drow priestesses, they were a myth, and others didn't even know they existed. They acted as handmaidens (presumably along with the [[yochlol]]s) and as midwives and guardians. Their existence was prophesied, and when the [[Silence of Lolth]] came to an end, they came into existence. They were seen guarding the [[gate]] from the ruined temple of Lolth in the [[Abyss]] to the new Demonweb Pits."
