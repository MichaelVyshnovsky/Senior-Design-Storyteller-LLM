==Description==
Ursinals looked like large humanoids with distinct bear-like attributes, including fur that was light golden, red, or golden brown in color, and a pronounced muzzle and upright ears.

==Personality==
Ursinals were kind creatures and enjoyed sharing their knowledge with others but had a tendency to digress when talking about a subject.

==Combat==
Ursinals disliked physical combat and violence but were fierce fighters and mighty spellcasters, having a wide array of spells and spell-like abilities.

==Society==
The ruler of the the ursinals was [[Bharrai]], the Great Bear. She represented the ursinals in the [[Talisid and the Five Companions|Five Companions]]. She was also called Mother Bear, because she treated other ursinals as cherished children. During winters, she would turn her lodge into a school of magic for the ursinals.<ref> Ursinals were also known to serve [[Mystra]], the goddess of magic.<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|13}}
