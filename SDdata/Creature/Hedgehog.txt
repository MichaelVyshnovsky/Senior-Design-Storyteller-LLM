Hedgehogs were small mammals that lived in forests.
These creatures could be found in the forest of Cormanthor and the Plain of Standing Stones. Beyond Faer√ªn, they could be found in the temperate forests and plains of Kara-Tur.
Hedgehogs were one of the many small creatures that brambles were known to use as mounts.
In the church of Baervan Wildwanderer, "Hedgehog" was one of the titles for confirmed priests, ranking directly above "Opossum" and below "Marten".
