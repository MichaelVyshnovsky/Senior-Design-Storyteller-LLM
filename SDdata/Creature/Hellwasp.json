They propelled themselves on thin, seemingly metallic wings,{{Cite adventurers league/Tipping the Scales|4}} Colony guards were somewhat smaller than the \"devil\" variety.",
        "Personality": "Hellwasps were aggressive, malevolent and ruthless, yet also logical and basically intelligent. They possessed the unquestioning instincts of colony insects, their alien minds always unswervingly loyal to their queen.",
        "Abilities": "Hellwasps were dangerously strong and protected by their thick carapaces, although they were vulnerable to the cold. They fought deftly in the air with their talons, although they were extremely slow and much less dangerous on land. Their stingers injected a chemical admixture, a fiery [[poison]] similar to [[alchemist's fire]] which doubled as a paralytic enzyme. Their attacks were magical, and they could communicated via a form of ''[[telepathy]]'' with a range of {{SI|300|ft}} perceptible only to them. \n\nHellwasp grubs were about as dangerous as [[monstrous centipedes]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Swarmed Heart|14}} Hellwasp queens were on the level of young [[dragon]]s in terms of power.{{Cite adventurers league/The Swarmed Heart|15}}",
        "Combat": "Hellwasp devils worked in units to kill or grab the foe. If colony guards were available, they swarmed a group of enemies, attempting to sting them into paralysis. From there the larger hellwasp devils could swoop in from behind, skewer the foe and  drag them off.{{Cite adventurers league/The Swarmed Heart|8}}",
        "Society": "[[File:DiA-94-Hellwasp nest-Titus Lunter.png|thumb|right|250px|''A hellwasp nest floating above the surface of Avernus, held down by iron chains.'']]\nHellwasp typically lived in communes consisting of roughly twenty-four adults, although the nests themselves could only comfortably fit ten to twenty and 2/3{{rd}}s of the hive were normally hunting at any given time. All members of the commune shared the nest and their duties, and had equal say in their society.{{Cite adventurers league/The Swarmed Heart|10}}\n\nThe first hellwasp colony nested in [[Malbolge]], within [[Glasya]]'s [[Malbolge#Notable Locations|Garden of Delights]], where the devils acted as unwavering agents of her will. Every member of the hive worked towards Glasya's desires, and unlike many of her other minions needed no seduction or manipulation to make them do so, as they saw service to her as an honor and reward in its own right. Such hellwasps found outside Malbolge were either on a mission for her or, on rare occasions, being loaned to one of her allies. By virtue of their unquestioning obedience to her, hellwasps would work with any who likewise served their queen.",

        },
        "History": "Hellwasp devils were once [[fiend]]s similar to [[mezzoloth]]s, [[demon]]s of the [[Abyss]] that served a wasp-like [[demon lord]]. After Glasya defeated the demon lord during the [[Blood War]], its curious spawn hailed her as their new queen, and she took them back to the Hells where they were remade into devils.\n\nThe [[owl]]-headed [[deva]] advisor of the [[solar]]-turned-archdevil [[Zariel]] followed his mistress into the [[Nine Hells]] despite her pleas she reconsider her course of action. Eventually he was torn apart by hellwasps and used as the center of their new nest. Some time after Zariel's failed attempt to absorb the city of [[Elturgard]], the heart began beating with increasing speed, driving the hellwasps into a frenzy that caused them to attack all they saw.{{Cite adventurers league/The Swarmed Heart}}"
