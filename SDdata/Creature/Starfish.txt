A '''starfish''', was a creature that was found in underwater locations across [[Toril]].

==Description==
[[File:Gromma - Idle Champions - Screenshot.JPG|thumb|250px|''A [[tortle]] with starfish on her shell.'']]
These marine creatures had five arms

==Abilities==
Though many starfish were completely harmless, some appeared to be both agile and vicious. It was possible for starfish to leap onto others' faces and strongly cling on to them with their multiple arms. An incredible feature of starfish was that they could completely grow back lost limbs.

==Combat==
{{Quote
|You meet the most charming friends. Wear it to town. It might start a fashion trend.
|A [[weasel]] to an [[undead]] knight struggling to get an aggressive starfish off of their face.

Starfish were not combatants that adventurers typically worried about, as their attacks did not seem to hurt.

==Species==
There existed numerous species of starfish across the Realms, that came in a variety of different colors and sizes. In the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] alone, there were over two hundred different types of sea star.
* [[Bane-star]]s, a dangerous species of starfish with a malevolent intelligence.
* [[Feeblestar]]s, a green-grey starfish that were found in deep oceans and [[kuo-toa]]n communities.
* [[Giant starfish]], a monstrously sized variety of starfish.

==Ecology==

|Do you know what it's like to have your eyeballs eaten by [[eel]]s and your brain sucked out by starfish? Let me assure you, it isn't much fun.

Starfish were known to live in [[kelp]] gardens, and they moved by curling and crawling. and were known to feed on [[clam]]s and [[mussel]]s,

A few creatures, such as the [[storm giant]]s of [[Maelstrom]], wore necklaces made from starfish.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1325}}, [[Artek]] and [[Corin]] found a talking skull that had once been a [[cleric]] of [[Lathander]]. His flesh had been eaten by [[fish]], and his brain was sucked out by a starfish.

{{Quote
|Ordinary ztarfish. But friend to mermen. All zea life here is zupposed to attack intruuuders.
|A merman on "ztarfish"
}}
Aggressive starfish inhabited a [[merman]]'s sunken garden in the catacombs beneath [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1357 DR]]. These starfish were friends with the merman and attacked intruders.

In the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the bard [[Bareris Anskuld]] wrote a ballad about a starfish that believed that it lived in the sky instead of the sea. This fictitious starfish had a comical journal where it attempted to make its place among the stars. This ballad was known to be a favorite of the [[Rashemi]] artisan, [[Tammith Iltazyarra]].
