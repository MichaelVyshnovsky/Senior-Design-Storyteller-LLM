        "mainbody": "'''Great feyrs''' were more powerful creatures that formed when several [[feyr|common feyrs]] combined into one.",
        "Description": "Great feyrs closely resembled common feyrs, with the same sickly, iridescent skin, hide wrinkled and mottled like the surface of a human brain, and hunchbacked appearance. Two tentacles take the place of legs, and are helped by other, smaller tentacles. Feyrs have multiple massive jaws and between 1 and 5 gold-colored eyes. Great feyrs are approximately {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Combat": "Like common feyrs, great feyrs could attack with their powerful jaws, but they preferred to rely on their spell-like abilities. Great feyrs could use both ''[[fear]]'' and ''[[emotion]]'', the latter of which could only call upon negative emotions. Great feyrs could use ''[[invisibility]]'', and exploited this to cast negative emotions (such as hopelessness) upon their enemies without them knowing the source.<!----> They were immune to both magical and non-magical fear.<!---->\n\nDue to their immense power, great feyrs were listed as one of the two types of creatures that could devour the ''[[Death Moon Orb]]''. The other type of creature was the [[tarrasque]].<ref>",
        "Ecology": "Unlike common feyrs, great feyrs could be found in any environment and were also active during the day, although they still preferred to operate at night.\n\nA great feyr forms were several common feyrs combine to create a single larger creature. They feed on the emotions of other creatures and often toy with their meals. Great feyrs may take long trips to reach a source of powerful emotion.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|1368}}, denizens living near [[Boareskyr Bridge]] felt that they were doomed by the chaotic crusade of [[Caelar Argent]]. The residual magical energy, as well as the negative emotions of the people, spawned a great feyr."
