        "Description": "A griffon had the body of a [[lion]] with the head and wings of an [[eagle]]. The forelimbs of the griffon were often like those of an eagle, ending in sharp talons, but this was not always the case. Just as lions and eagles had varying physical characteristics based on where in the world they are found, so too did griffons. An adult griffon was about {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} long, with a wingspan of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}. The average griffon weighed about {{SI|500|lbs}}.{{Cite dragon/273/Shamur's Wager|57}}",
        "Behavior": "Griffons were known to be somewhat intelligent creatures, though had a penchant for aggression. Young griffons were generally not combative.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Griffons were carnivorous creatures. Their favorite animal to prey upon was [[horse]]s. They would often attack them when within sight or smelling distance.",
            "Homelands": "Griffons typically  made their nests in homes in high rocky places like cliffs,\n\nWhen acquainted with humans, they were usually stabled in airy, doorless stone halls, vaguely resembling their lairs.\n\nIn the [[Unapproachable East]], they nested at the highest reaches of the [[Tannath mountains]] and [[Umbergoth]]. They could also be found around the coastal regions and interior uplands of [[Aglarond]].<ref>",
            "Relationships": "When tamed and raised at a young age they could become very loyal and fierce mounts. Because of this they were highly sought after, with eggs fetching prices of around 2,000 [[gp]] and fledglings for around 5,000 gp."
        },
        "Mounts": "Griffons were commonly found as mounts throughout the Realms. Some notable examples:\n* The griffon riders of [[Tith Tilendrothael]] of ancient [[Netheril]] are thought to be the first such riders.\n* The [[Griffon Cavalry]] of [[Waterdeep]]\n* The [[Griffon Legion]] of [[Thay]]\n* The [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] mercenary company",
