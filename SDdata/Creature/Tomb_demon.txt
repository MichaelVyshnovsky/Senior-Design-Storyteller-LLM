A tomb demon was a type of demon found within the Abyss.  Tomb demons were the result of the power of the Abyss on mass graves, and often represented the horrible joining of a humanoid and snake, all with bone.  Tomb demons first came to be after a battle between Orcus and Sylbarax, who was once an exarch of Zehir.  Orcus used his necromantic powers to raise the dead followers of Sylbarax, thus creating the tomb demons. 
Tomb demons were able to constrict their foes within their bony grip and often made use of conventional weapons as well.
Tomb demons sought to constrict their weaker or less armored opponents first, opting to ignore other, potentially more dangerous threats.
