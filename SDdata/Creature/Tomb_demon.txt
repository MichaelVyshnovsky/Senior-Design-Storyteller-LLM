A '''tomb demon''' was a type of [[demon]] found within the [[Abyss]].  Tomb demons were the result of the power of the Abyss on mass graves, and often represented the horrible joining of a humanoid and snake, all with bone.  Tomb demons first came to be after a battle between [[Orcus]] and [[Sylbarax]], who was once an exarch of [[Zehir]].  Orcus used his necromantic powers to raise the dead followers of Sylbarax, thus creating the tomb demons. 
==Abilities==
Tomb demons were able to constrict their foes within their bony grip and often made use of conventional weapons as well.
==Combat==
Tomb demons sought to constrict their weaker or less armored opponents first, opting to ignore other, potentially more dangerous threats.
