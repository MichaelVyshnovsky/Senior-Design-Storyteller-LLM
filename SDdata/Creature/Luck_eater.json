        "Description": "Luck eaters resembled small domestic cats, {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length, with golden or black short hair and slender bodies.",
        "Abilities": "All creatures within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of a purring luck eater were likely to become attracted to it and desire to take the luck eater with them. Luck eaters obliged this desire, staying with their victims for around two to five hours. After departing, those charmed by a luck eater would gradually come to their senses.\n\nDuring their time with a victim, luck eaters continually emitted a soft purr, causing an aura to emanate from them that fed off the luck of creatures engaging in combat within range of their purring. This process lowered the positive probability of those affected.\n\nLuck eaters gradually became impatient however. If their victims went a period of thirty minutes without engaging a creature, the effect of their aura would alter to make them fight the next creature they encountered. If they continued to go without food then a luck eater would alter their aura once again, driving their victim to fight even creatures it considered to be allies. After the battle that would ensue from such an extreme measure, a luck eater would slink away.",
        "Combat": "Luck eaters were largely ineffective in facing creatures in direct combat.",
        "History": "Around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], luck eaters were known to lurk around the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] at night.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "As their name implied, these creatures fed off the altered luck of others.",
            "Habitats": "Luck eaters were very versatile creatures, being found in nearly any kind of land except those with an arctic climate.",
            "Relationships": "Luck eaters were a [[favored monster]] of the [[deities]] [[Brandobaris]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], and [[Vergadain]]. Vergadain in particular was known to express his displeasure with people by the presence of luck eaters."
