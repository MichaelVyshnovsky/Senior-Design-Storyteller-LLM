        "mainbody": "Gorgosaurus, also known as albertosaurus, was a type of dinosaur.In reality, the gorgosaurus and albertosaurus are two very similar, closely related genuses of tyrannosaurid dinosaur. D&D sources reflect an early view that they are in fact the same genus, but later research suggests they are not, though this is still debated by some paleontologists. Being based on D&D sources, this article treats them as the same, at least for D&D purposes.\nGorgosaurs looked like other carnosaurs like the tyrannosaurus, but were somewhat smaller. They had a long jaw that was filled with rear-facing teeth. \nGorgosaurs were known for being aggressive.\nGorgosaurs were carnivorous and solitary creatures. In the Realms, gorgosauruses could be found inhabiting the land of Chult and the Malatran Plateau.\nIt was speculated by sages that gorgosauruses were the ancestors of tyrannosaurs."
