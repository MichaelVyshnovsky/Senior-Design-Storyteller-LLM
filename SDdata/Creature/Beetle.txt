'''Beetles''' were [[insect]]s found in many places and variations on [[Toril]], often in giant sizes.

==Biology==
Most species of beetle lacked good eyesight or hearing. Because of this, they primarily relied upon their tactile and taste senses. The latter was done by means of their antennae.

==Species==
* [[Aratha]], otherwise known as "killer beetles," were a rare species of [[psionic]] beetle that had been hunted to near-extinction.
* [[Bark beetle]]s were a mundane species of beetle found in the forests of [[Cormanthor]]. They were known to burrow underneath the bark of trees and [[treant]]s to lay their eggs inside.
* [[Carrion beetle]]
* [[Crimson Lake beetle]], a species of mundane beetles that were endemic to the Great [[Anauroch]].
* [[Deathmirror beetle]]
* [[Dung beetle]]s, a species of mundane beetles, often used as derogatory insult.
* [[Emperor beetle]]s were an extremely rare species of giant beetle, prized for their iridescent shells.
* [[Giant bombardier beetle]]s were able to emit an acid cloud that burned enemies.
* [[Giant boring beetle]]s were large and favored eating wood.
* [[Giant fire beetle]]s were about {{SIAdj|2|ft|c|adj=long}} nocturnal insects. They had two glands, one above each eye, that produced a red glow.
* [[Giant rhinoceros beetle]]s were a monstrous variety of [[rhinoceros beetle]], typically found in tropical or subtropical jungles.
* [[Giant scarab beetle]]s, which could be up to {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} long, were found in many locations in the [[Underdark]].{{Cite dragon/227/The Dragon's Bestiary: Monsters of the Underdark|23}}
* [[Giant stag beetle]]s were a monstrous variety of [[stag beetle]]s.
* [[Giant water beetle]]s were a species of giant beetle that moved swiftly in water and struggled to move on dry land.
* [[Goldbug]]s, a parasitic species endemic to [[Zakhara]] that resembled the [[gold piece|gold coins]] found in that land.
* [[Shrub beetle]]s, a mundane species of beetle found in [[Cormanthor]]. They were known for jumping into the [[River Ashaba]] to cool off, but often sank and drowned in the process.
* [[Slicer beetle]]s were a rare species of giant beetle that bore a resemblance to the giant stag species, but were distant relatives of death watch beetles.
* [[Stink beetle]]s could produce miasmal stench in self-defense.
* [[Swamp beetle]]s were a species of giant beetles found in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast]].
* [[Tangler beetle]]s were a species of giant beetle notable for their adhesive saliva.
* [[Water beetle]]
* [[Weevil]]s were mundane pests that fed on grains and flours.
* [[Yahcha]] was a species of edible beetle that possessed curative properties against [[blue mist fever]], found in the jungles of [[Chult]].


==Ecology==
===Diet===
In general, these creatures were liable to eat almost any form of organic matter tasted by their antennae, even other species of beetle. Each species tended to have dietary preferences. Those that lived in the [[Underdark]] were often fungivores.

Giant beetles ground and crushed whatever they ate with their mandibles, making it difficult to revive consumed organisms.

===Habitats===
Shrub beetles were found in [[Cormanthor]]. 

Aggressive carnivorous giant beetles could be found within upper layers of [[Undermountain]], notably, in the [[Garden of the Drow]] and nearby Temple of [[Bane]].

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], giant beetles could be found living in the trunk of [[Yggdrasil|Yggdrasil the World Ash]].

===Relationships===
Some races within the Underdark kept giant beetles as livestock.

The military of [[Thay]] sometimes outfitted its soldiers with giant beetles as [[mount]]s.

==Trivia==
The [[noh]] play ''[[Lady Sei]]'' featured an anthropomorphized beetle by the name of Minbu.
