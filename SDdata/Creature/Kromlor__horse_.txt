The '''Kromlor''' was a massive [[horse|workhorse]], often using for farming, mining or other intensive labor in [[west Faer√ªn]] from the [[Sword Coast]] up to [[the North]]. They were particularly popular in [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
Famous for their massive size, but hard-working personality, the Kromlor was a magnificent specimen of a horse. They sold for as high as 1,000 [[gp]].

==Origins==
According to some historians, the Kromlor was the result of breeding the [[Nars]] and [[Chionthar (horse)|Chionthar]].

This horse took its name after the famed [[Kromlor (family)|Kromlor]] family of [[Longsaddle]], some of the first pioneers to settle in the harsh [[Savage Frontier]].
