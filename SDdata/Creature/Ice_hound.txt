An '''ice hound''' was an extraplanar wolf-like creature.

==Description==
Ice hounds were said to be "cold [[hell hound]]s", and were in fact relatives of them.

==Combat==
These creatures could not be harmed by any cold-based attacks. They were particularly susceptible to fire damage, and thus were often countered by ''[[fireball]]s''.

They attacked by using their icy breath, as well as a deadly bite.

==Ecology==
When summoned to the [[Prime Material plane]], they were often used to protect areas in freezing cold places. As such, ice hounds were known to lurk in the [[Frozenfar]], in places such as [[Fireshear]], [[Aurilssbarg]], [[Bjorn's Hold]], and [[Icewolf]].
