        "Description": "Mummy lords often resembled other [[mummies]], but retained the regalia and weaponry they carried in their former life.",
        "Abilities": "Many mummy lords were especially powerful [[spellcaster]]s, often raised as guardians for the resting place of whomever they served in life. They could inspire utter despair in the minds of their foes with their mere gaze.\n\nThe desiccated heart of the mummy lord served as its [[phylactery]]â€”so long as it remained intact, the mummy lord could not be entirely destroyed and would reform within their lair within a day's time. To destroy a mummy lord permanently, fire had to be used to burn its heart to ashes.",
        "Combat": "Mummy lords could speak words of blasphemy that made their foes freeze in place. They could also inhibit all manner of healing around them, by means of focusing pure [[negative energy]].\n\nAs with other mummies, mummy lords could inflict the disease known as [[mummy rot]] with their mere touch.\n\nMummy lords were immune to [[disease]] and [[poison]] and were highly resistant to all forms of [[magic]]. They were however especially vulnerable to fire and flame, and in fact could only be destroyed by such.",
        "Society": "The [[ritual]]s used to create mummy lords were known among only the most powerful [[cleric]]s. The heart and innards of the deceased person or creature were removed from its corpse and placed in [[limestone]] or [[clay]] [[canopic jar]]s, which were inscribed with religious symbology.\n\nThe lairs of mummy lords were twisted with dark powers. Any food or drink brought within would spoil or turn to rot and water would immediately evaporate. [[Divination]] magic was not nearly as accurate when cast within their lairs, often leading to incorrect or deceptive portents. Any being that stole items found within their lairs were [[curse]]d until they were returned to their rightful place within.\n\nMummy lords were often served by scores of lesser undead.",
        "History": "The tome entitled ''[[The Canopic Being]]'' outlined rituals used to create mummy lords. The original could be found in [[Candlekeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Notable Mummy Lords": "[[File:Valin_Sarnaster.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Valin Sarnaster, the mummy lord of the House of the All-Seeing Orb.'']]\n* [[Chon Vrael]], the [[Thay]]an high priest of [[Kossuth]]'s temple in [[Amruthar]].\n* [[Diderius]], the ancient [[diviner]] with connections to long-lost [[Netheril]].\n* [[Elchorius]], a noble priest of [[Sebek]] from [[Mulhorand]].{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|16}}\n* [[Gorka Tharn]], the [[duergar]] that dwelled within the [[Runestone Caverns]] within [[Undermountain]].\n* [[Mystic Carrion]], the erudite whisperer-of-souls that lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Shaxan Kazaraat]], the [[Netherese]] wizard that was forced to serve the [[blue dragon]] [[Iymrith]] against his will.\n* [[Valin Sarnaster]], a venerated cleric of [[Savras]] that dwelled in the [[House of the All-Seeing Orb]] in [[Tashluta]]."
