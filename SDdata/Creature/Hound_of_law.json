        "mainbody": "The '''hounds of law''' were a form of [[will-o'-wisp]] bred by the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]] to serve as trackers, guards, and messengers.",
        "Description": "In their natural form, hounds of law were tiny luminous spheres as bright as fireflies. They could vibrate rapidly in order to produce buzzing sounds, which they used as a limited form of communication.",
        "Abilities": "Hounds of law could rapidly transform themselves into various animals, such as [[dog]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[horse]]s, [[panther]]s, [[rat]]s, [[shark]]s, and [[snake]]s. Transformed hounds of law were usually more powerful than normal animals.\n\nThey could move between the [[Astral Plane]], [[Ethereal Plane]], and [[Material Plane]] at will. They had the ability to become invisible, and would sometimes detect other invisible creatures.\n\nWhen tracking a creature, hounds of law could sense residual magic to follow it if it used flying or [[teleportation]] magic.\n\nHounds of law were unaffected by all but a few spells, including ''[[protection from alignment]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[maze]]''.",
        "Behavior": "Hounds of law were lawful creatures bred by the vaati. As such, they were loyal to their masters and would sometimes be sent on solitary missions. A few hounds bred by Wendeam vaati were [[lawful good]] like their masters."
