        "mainbody": "Snowcloaks, also known as snow ghosts, were large aberrant creatures that could be found flying across the freezing skies over the Spine of the World.\nSnowcloaks had two eel-like heads, each at the end of a long sinous neck, that were dotted with several rows of silver-colored eyes. Each head had a long, pointed jaw filled with needle-sharp teeth. Their bodies were somewhat flat with blunt wings, not unlike the body of a manta ray. Their bodies terminated in a long, lashing, whip-like tail.\nThe underside of their bodies were gray, while their topsides were as white as snow. These colorations helped them to blend in with their environment.\nSnowcloaks kept no lairs, preferring to continuously soar across the skies searching for meals.\nSnowcloaks were immune to any harsh or freezing cold and possessed regenerative properties. They also possessed a number of spell-like abilities. They could release a dense fog that blinded others, emit magic projectiles, and disorient others with hypnotizing patterns.\nSkilled and patient hunters, snowcloaks preferred to drop down and harry their prey. Their claws inflicting a paralyzing toxin.\nSnowcloaks soared the skies alone, or in small groups of three to eight, called drifts.\nThese creatures were capable of speaking both Auran and Common.\nThe toxin released by the claws on their wings were highly prized by alchemists for use in creating poisons."
