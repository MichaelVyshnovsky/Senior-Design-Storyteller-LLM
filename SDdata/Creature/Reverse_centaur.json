        "mainbody": "The reverse centaur was a creature that lived in Neverwinter Wood on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.\nA reverse centaur had the upper body of a horse and the lower body of a human. This made it different from regular centaurs, which had the upper body of the latter.\nThe only observed reverse centaur used stealth before engaging in combat. It attacked by kicking and performing a flurry of hoof attacks.\nThe only observed reverse centaur was found in a forest. It stalked Neverwinter Wood alone and attacked individuals that came too close. It was wearing clothing, including a buttoned shirt."
