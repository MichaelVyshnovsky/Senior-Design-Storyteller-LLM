A '''necrophidius''', also known as a '''death worm''', was a [[construct]] that looked like a huge skeletal [[snake]] with the skull of a [[human]].

==Description==
The bodies of death worms were bleached-white and their human-like heads had snake-like fangs. Their skulls seemed to have swirling white eyes, and their bodies emitted no odor. They were able to crawl completely silently, and could stand on the tip of their tail to elevate themselves to around 12 feet (3.7 meters).

These very rare creatures could understand [[Common]], but were unable to speak. As well as this, they were adept at climbing, sneaking, and hiding. Although they appeared to be [[undead]], they were not, much like a [[bone golem]].

==Combat==
Owing to their stealthy nature, necrophidii would often hide and then launch a sneak attack on an opponent. If spotted in plain sight, these creatures could hypnotize prey by whirling in a specific manner, and then viciously bite their victims. This vicious bite could even paralyze a foe, and cause them to become unconscious for up to 10 minutes. They sometimes attacked in groups, causing their enemies to be flanked, giving the constructs an advantage in combat.

As with other constructs, they were immune to [[poison]], paralysis, [[disease]], and ''[[sleep]]'' as well as other mind-affecting [[spell]]s and abilities.

==Variants==
;Two-Headed: A two-headed variant of necrophidius that was developed by the [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] necromancer [[Sumulael]]. He scribbled in the margins of his ''necrophidicon'' how one could extend the usual recipe for these golems in order to create his two-headed variant.

==Ecology==
As these golems had no need for food or sleep, they did not have a large impact on ecology. However, they obeyed the word of their masters, and so could hunt down creatures in an area they were commanded to protect.
===Creation===
Necrophidius constructs were often made to serve as assassins or guards. The base cost for such a construct was 5,000 [[gp]], but more powerful ones could be made. The spellcaster had to have the ability to craft wondrous items, as well as be willing to lose power in the production of such a construct, and five days spare.

The required components were a skeleton of a snake, a skull of a humanoid, and the [[material component]]s needed for the individual spells. [[Arcane spellcaster]]s required the usage of ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[Mordenkainen's faithful hound]]'', and ''[[hypnotism]]''. [[Divine spellcaster]]s required the same first two spells as a [[mage]], but also needed ''[[animate objects]]'' and ''[[command]]''. Other spell combinations were known to create a necrophidius, as well as differing expenditures in both gold and time.

However, it was also possible to create these constructs by using a tome similar to a ''[[manual of golems]]'',
===Habitats===
Beyond [[Toril]], these constructs were known to exist on the planet of [[Oerth]] and in the [[Domains of Dread]].

==History==
Such creatures were known to be kept by [[Netherese]] lords in the [[Shadowfell]], such as [[Draygo Quick]]. 

They were also known to lurk in the [[Dungeon Level|first level]] of [[Undermountain]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

In the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Effron Alegni]] managed to acquire one of these constructs.
