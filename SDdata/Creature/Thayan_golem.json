        "mainbody": "A Thayan golem was a variety of golem constructed and sold exclusively by the Red Wizards of Thay. They were vigilant sentries for those who wanted to enjoy the distinct \"golem-enhanced lifestyle\".\nOn a superficial level, a Thayan golem represented a humanoid guardsman standing  tall. They were formed from polished Thayan oak but bore no markings that linked them to their native Thay.\nOne of the golems forearms was replaced by a built-in longbow. The golem was quite skilled with the weapon, capable of mimicking the combat feats of skilled archers.\nWhile Thayan golems lacked the comprehensive spell immunity enjoyed by most other forms of golem, they were completely impervious to magic missiles. They maintained the usual immunities poison, diseases, energy drains, as well as mind-altering spells and effects.\nThe origins of Thayan golems traced back to the first attempts the Red Wizards made to establish one of their enclaves in the Dalelands. The native Dalesman rebuked the golems as shameful and extravagant due to their cultural appreciation for archery and longbows as weapons.\nThe Red Wizards then tried a different tact, offering their golems for sale to the neighboring nation of Sembia, as a defense against the brigands of the Dales. Since then, they have garnered the reputation as something of a status symbol among Sembian merchants.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the process for constructing a Thayan golem remained a secret known only to the Red Wizards. The minimum price at which they would sell one of these constructs was about forty thousand gold pieces."
