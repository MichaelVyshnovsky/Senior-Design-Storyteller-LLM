Spectators were extraplanar beholderkin native to the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus. The five-eyed entities were philosophical creatures often summoned to serve as watchful guardians.
Spectators had  bodies, which weighed . Like regular beholders, they had a single main eye in the middle of their floating bodies.
Spectators were vigilant and trustworthy, and could be relied upon to protect items in all but the most dire situations. They possessed two methods of behavior a free-thinking mode and a contemplative mode. Free-thinking spectators would wander the planes at will, openly, if cautiously, chatting with those they came across. In their contemplative state, they were philosophers who would spend over a century pondering vast philosophical questions. Approached in this state they were still friendly and enjoyed discourse but would soon after request to be left alone so as to continue philosophizing. Years of isolation could result in spectators gaining personality quirks such as referring to themselves in the third person or adopting the voice of its summoner.
Spectators disliked guarding things for lesser lifeforms, which most mortal summoners would qualify as, and would only do so hesitantly. After promising to do so, however, their loyalty to their summoner was absolute, guarding the object in question until their time was up. They prided themselves on their guardianship and refused commands to do anything else until asked to guard something else or they were allowed to leave a summoners grasp. The greatest pleasure for most spectators was thwarting the forces of chaos and in defending valuable objects. A spectators strong sense of justice dictated that creatures who did not intrude upon their duties had a right to live, and they would never attack a helpless opponent unless attacked via sly or cruel means. Killing creatures for any reason outside of duty or self-defense would lead most spectators to commit suicide in distress via self-imposed brain overload.
Somewhat mild and even-tempered, they were even known to form friendships with other creatures, a trait that no other beholderkin or true beholder ever displayed.

Spectators were smaller than regular beholders and as such required less food, although a full meal for them was still enough to make a large meal for 6 people. They could simply conjure the large quantity of food needed for them to live each day, although they were willing to share with visitors. When spectators slept they drifted aimlessly around a given area.
In the middle of their brains laid a small magical organ shaped like a sphere, that granted them the ability to fly, although it could not be magically disabled. A spectators brain generated magical energy with psionic power, but was not strong enough to grant it psychic abilities. It created both magical and anti-magical force, with the former used to power its eye rays and the latter used for its spell turning. Spectators possessed a perfect internal clock, able to tell exactly when a certain amount of time had elapsed with extreme precision. Because spectators came from Nirvana, they were best adapted to equal amounts of environmental factors, (light and dark, heat and cold, liquid and solid terrain etc).
So long as they were within Mechanus, spectators possessed a rapid regenerative ability capable of repairing lost structures and recovering from general damage.
Newborn spectators arose from the eyes of their recently deceased parent. Each was born with the ability to levitate, along with the eye ray power of whatever stalk they came from. One spectator had the ability to create food and water and shared it with its siblings. Every 3 months a new eye power would be gained and the spectators would grow larger. After a year passed, each spectator would leave their birth home and create their own lair. Once a spectator became 1,000 years old the cycle would reverse in a sense, with their eyes becoming progressively larger and their body slowly turning smaller at the same points in time that the new spectators would gain eye powers. Nine months after their thousandth birthday, the spectator would grow 4 tiny eye stalks on each of its old eye stalks and 3 months afterwards would die, causing the cycle to begin anew. Neither newborn, nor elderly spectators could be summoned via the ritual.
In 1370 DR, Waterdeep was briefly plagued by a small army of spectators who were sent there to "guard" powerful and notable enchanted items, such as Khelben Arunsuns Blackstaff and Piergeiron Paladinsons Halcyon. The spectators caused panic and chaos in the city and guarded the entrance to Undermountain. Khelben deducted that Ibbalar Thrul, a disgraced wizard and businessman, was likely behind the attack. He sent one of his agents into the wizards lair in Undermountain. Subsequently, the summoning portal was sealed, and Ibbalars attack was stopped.
The annals of Helms church claimed that the God of Guardians, in times long past, created the spectators as the ultimate guardians to assist his fallible human followers, only for various dark gods to corrupt them into beholders and their various kin. Followers of Bane meanwhile purported that their own tyrannical deity made the eye tyrants as the ultimate rulers, and that spectators were Helms inferior imitations. Followers of Helm tried to destroy beholders and kin whenever possible, while Banes returned the favor regarding spectators.
