They were large behemoths encountered in the wild and even occasionally trained for use as flying mounts, much like [[dragon]]s, albeit with less intelligence.",
        "Description": "A pteranodon was a birdlike reptile with sharp talons and leathery skin. One of the few flying dinosaur species, this monster was able to fly quite aptly due to its 30 ft. (9.1 m) leathery wings. Combined with a long beak, the pteranodon held the middle ground between a reptile and a bird, although its beak was beset with razor-sharp teeth. It had a thin headcrest, and its skin contained small patches of downy feathers. Its large eyes were yellow-colored.",

            "Training": "These powerful beasts could be used as a flying mount in aerial combat. To train one was hard work taking a skilled rider six weeks of training. The effort paid off with their ability to dive onto unsuspecting targets which made them and their riders a formidable opponent. Being strong creatures, they could also be employed to transport cargo since they could drag up to 4,500 lb (2.0 tons)."
