        "Description": "Shadow jellies appeared to be large, pulsating pools of living darkness. Unlike other shadow creatures, shadow jellies were tangible. Experienced [[adventurer]]s had a chance of spotting a huge patch of unnatural darkness, but they were clearly visible in full light.",
        "Abilities": "They were capable climbers and possessed [[blindsight]] that allowed them to feel the prey as far as {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "In battle, shadow jellies darted forward, slamming at the opponents, trying to attach to their victims and drag them into the darkness to be consumed. When a shadow jelly touched a creature, it began draining its physical strength, gradually weakening it.",
        "Ecology": "These solitary creatures were shadows driven by one thingâ€”the constant insatiable desire to consume living things and light. When prey fell into their pseudopods, the living shadow ooze enveloped and engulfed the creature, slowly dissolving it within its digestive organs.\n\nShadow jellies inhabited the deepest and darkest areas on the [[Prime Material plane]] when away from their hope in the Shadowfell. They lay in wait until prey was near and then quickly transformed into fearless and tireless ravenous predators. However, most creatures who were as big as a shadow jelly or bigger, were left alone."
