        "Description": "An eye monger was a hulking creature of {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. Its body was virtually indistinguishable from a round asteroid, until it sensed vibrations around it and opened its single huge beholder-like eye and gaping maw, which was used to swallow creatures whole.",
        "Personality": "These creatures did not value nor collect treasure, but some valuable items might be found in their stomachs as leftovers from digested [[adventurer]]s. Such items as [[coin]]s, [[metal]]s, [[gem]]s, and [[enchanted]] things were not digestible.",
        "Abilities": "Unlike their beholder relatives, eye mongers did not possess the ability to project a cone of [[anti-magic aura]] from their eye, instead, the anti-magic was located within the eye mongers' gullet and stopped swallowed creatures from escaping via sorcery.\n\nThey possessed [[darkvision]] and [[tremorsense]] of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "Going into combat, eye mongers stayed hidden until the last possible moment when they had an opportunity to bite and swallow the victim whole. During a battle, all they did was use their maws to bite and swallow. Swallowed creatures were immediately placed within anti-magic [[acid]]-filled gullet.",
        "Ecology": "Despite being carnivorous creatures that required nourishment, they did not need to breathe."
