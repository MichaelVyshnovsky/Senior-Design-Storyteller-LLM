Doomspinner spiders were a type of monstrously sized spider that emerged in the Realms following the Spellplague.
These creatures had a poisonous bite and they spun elaborate webs to catch their prey with.
Around the late 15 century DR, doomspinner spiders could be found being used by the drow house known as House Xorlarrin.
