        "mainbody": "Bog hags were vile, swamp-dwelling hags, heinous crones that preyed on humans. They stole the flesh of their victims to hide their hideous forms, using their hides as an appealing, skin-deep disguise.\nIn their true forms, bog hags appeared as green, ugly beldams with jagged teeth and sharp nails, standing about  tall and weighing about  on average. Like other hags, they could disguise their natural appearance, most often taking the form of a human, half-elf, young elven woman, or eladrin.\nBog hags were skilled in the art of deception and reading intent, as well as intimidation. They were also well-versed in matters of the natural world.\nBog hags could walk unimpeded through swamps, swim as fast as they could run, and could breathe underwater. Fire was particularly dangerous to them. The unwholesome presence of a bog hag made recovery from injury more difficult.\nUnlike ordinary hags, which used illusion or bodily alteration to change their appearances without aid, a bog hag altered herself by stealing and wearing the skin of her victims. Through an innate supernatural power, their body shaped and conformed to the skin suit, allowing them to temporarily masquerade as the victim for a time.  After shifting skins,\nBog hags staked out territory from below bodies of water near human communities, waiting to ambush the unwary that came by. They fought with hit-and-run tactics, charging past their prey as they slashed them with their claws.\nBog hags dwelt in marshes and mires\nBog hags sometimes performed dark rituals to create lacedon servants.\n* Evelda Bloodbath, one of the captains of the Tidescourge pirate gang."
