        "mainbody": "Shades were humanoids who had merged with the essence of shadowstuff. They were said to have traded away their very souls,\nWhile their size varied depending on race and stature pre-conversion, shades generally appeared more slender than other humanoids. Their skin looked wholly lifeless, in hue ranging from ash-gray to black, becoming darker as they got older. \nShades had black eyes,\nInitially, shades of the Realms were not born but rather created by one or more magical processes.\nBecoming a shade was also possible by completing a ritual in the Fane of Shadows, the temple of Shar that shifted in and out of the Prime Material plane.\nShades each had free will, and were not inherently evil, but often dedicated themselves to malevolent leaders or causes. They were generally calm, calculating individuals that preferred to act without others taking notice.\nThe shades of Thultanthar had an insulated society, separated from that of neighboring Realms. They were a cold and aloof people who kept old and often outdated sensibilities. A select few were chosen as ambassadors of the enclave, and dispatched to speak for their people in foreign lands.\nShades often preferred drab, dull-colored, while those from Thultanthar wore attire that seemed otherworldly to the people of Faerûn.\nShades grew more powerful in areas of darkness or shadows, but weaker when exposed to direct sunlight. They possessed an inherent form of regeneration, and even regrow lost limbs while cloaked in shadows. A shades regenerative powers could be negated by contact with radiant energy.\nThey held powers associated with the Shadowfell, such as the ability to leap from shadow to shadow, to create shadowy duplicates of themselves, and even to become entirely invisible. They could also decrease the amount of light in an area and could see through darkness, even of the magical variety.\nThey could see in complete darkness, including, unusually, magical darkness.\nShades were among the outsiders most generally feared across the breadth of Faerûn. Shades in turn believed themselves wholly superior to all non-shades in existence.\nNetherese shades were first created through the research of Netherese wizards who left Faerûn for the Plane of Shadow―the previous iteration of the Shadowfell―for research purposes long before the kingdoms fall at Karsuss Folly in the -4 century DR. During this journey, it was found that by removing a part of ones soul and replacing it with the essence of shadow, a shade could be produced. This was an extremely complex and painful process, but the result was a being with a prolonged life and a greatly strengthened set of abilities when in the presence of shadows.\nLike the Shadovar of Netheril, many Eshowe of Chult also became shades, particularly priests of Eshowdow, the Shadow Giant, and mages who were members of the Abuya-Deimshowa.\nIn the , the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar, then home to many shades in service to Shar, returned to Faerûn after centuries in the Plane of Shadow. As directed by the citys Princes of Shade, a select few Shadovar―citizens of Thultanthar―were rewarded for their immense loyalty to the city by being made into shades. \nSome adventurers of the Realms took up the mantle as shade hunters, vowing to stop the Netherese shades and hinder their efforts to recreate their ancient empire at all costs.\n* Alauneth Orrane, the original Black Viper of Waterdeep.\n* Erevis Cale, a retired assassin and Sembian butler who lived a second life as an adventurer, before discovering he was the Chosen of Mask.\n* The Faceless Incanter, the shade that infused the mythallar of Synod with the Shadow Weave.\n* Kesson Rel, the former Chosen of Mask from the world of Ephyras, who forsook his deity for the goddess Shar.\n* Telamont Tanthul, the famous arcanist and ruler of the returned Netherese empire."
