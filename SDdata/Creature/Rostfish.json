        "mainbody": "rostfish was a creature that dwelt in the Marsh of Chelimber.\nIn 1374 DR, the lizardfolk Sleyvas claimed that these creatures spoke to him. They apparently told him that the three adventurers, Kromlech Bruenghor, Vahn, and Adrianna, would enter the Marsh of Chelimber. As he later deceived the adventurers, it is possible that his claims were not true."
