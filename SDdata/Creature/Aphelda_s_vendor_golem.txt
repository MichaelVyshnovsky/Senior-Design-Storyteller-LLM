Apheldas vendor golem was a construct creature what was capable of functioning as a shopkeep on behalf of its creator.
A vendor golem performed all tasks that a real shopkeep did on a daily basis. They could purchase, sell, and haggle over the stores stock. Skilled wizard store keeps left these strange creatures in charge of their stores. Leomunds merchant elemental was a similar creature and a viable alternative. Some claimed that unlike Leomunds elemental, Apheldas construct was a mercantile pushover.
