A duhlarkin was any creature created through the use of the Duhlarks animerge spell.
Since Duhlarks animerge allowed the caster to fuse two different creatures into one new creature that possessed physical traits of both, the description of a duhlarkin varied greatly.
The type of physical attacks that a duhlarkin was capable of depended on the physical attributes it acquired from its "parent" creatures.
The general behavior of a duhlarkin was similar to that of the dominant creature used during its creation. A duhlarkin was capable of reproducing by mating with either of the creatures it was related to. The offspring from these unions were stillborn a quarter of the time, resulted in a duhlarkin a quarter of the time, and resulted in the pure creature half of the time. A pair of mating duhlarkins would result in a stillborn half of the time and duhlarkin half of the time.
