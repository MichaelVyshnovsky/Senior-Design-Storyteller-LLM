        "Combat": "Under most circumstances a zaratan woken from its slumber would immediately withdraw into its giant shell just like a regular turtle. They would remain withdrawn for up to a decade.\n\nIf wounded or pestered enough, a zaratan would attack with all of its awesome fury.",

A few corsairs even used them as hidden bases. The most famous of these was [[Jayani al-Jasir]].\n\nThe inhabitants of zaratan islands were often incredibly superstitious, believing their island to be a [[deity]] whose wrath would be terrible if disturbed. This lead them to sacrifice large quantities of fish, and even visitors, to please their zaratan."
