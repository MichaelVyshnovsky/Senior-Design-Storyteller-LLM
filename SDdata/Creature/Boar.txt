'''Boars''' were wild relatives of the domestic [[pig]]. They were favored animals of the deities [[Gruumsh]], [[Gwaeron Windstrom]], [[Ilneval]], [[Luthic]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], [[Shargaas]], and [[Yurtrus]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12-15}}

==Description==
Boars were covered in thick fur, often brown or grayish in color. The exact size of a boar varied from species to species, from roughly [[human]] size to roughly the mass of an [[ogre]] or similarly sized creature. All varieties of boars were armed with sharp tusks that jutted out from beneath their snout and which were capable of causing serious injury. Boars also had a highly developed sense of smell.

==Behavior==
Though not predatory by nature, boars were ill-tempered and territorial, a combination made worse by boars' powerful musculature and sharp tusks.

==Species==
There existed several species of boar in the Realms, some of which are listed below.

:Larger than usual boars with increased aggression.
;[[Pig]]
:The domestic variant of boars, raised for livestock.
;[[Thunderfury boar]]
:The [[fey]] derivative of boars, which were far more ferocious than their Prime kin.

==Ecology==
Boars usually traveled in groups known as '''sounders'''.
===Habitats===
[[File:Boar Shoat.png|thumb|200px|right|''A young boar shoat.'']]
Boars were found in most locales across the world, from chilly tundras to hot jungles.

In [[north Faerûn]], wild boars inhabited the medium woods of [[Cormanthor]], [[Daggerdale]], and [[Shadowdale]]. Particularly the [[Border Forest]] and [[Vale of Lost Voices]]. They could also be found in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]], the forests of [[Mistledale]], around the [[Pool of Yeven]],<ref> and in the [[Ardeep Forest]].{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|8}}<ref group="note" name="note1">[[Dragon magazine 128|''Dragon'' #128]]'s article "Welcome to Waterdeep" states that [[Monster Manual II 1st edition|''Monster Manual II'']]'s "cold, civilized forest" table is representative of what can be found in Ardeep forest. They were found throughout the [[Savage Frontier]].

In [[interior Faerûn]] found in [[Cormyr]], while in [[west Faerûn]] they could be found in [[Tethyr]] and in [[Amn]], where they were so common along the [[Trade Way]] near the [[Battlescarred Bard]] inn that some believed a local landowner must have been using a [[deepspawn]] to create them. They were also particularly common throughout the forests of [[the Vast]]. In the [[Unapproachable East]], they could be found in the [[Forest of Lethyr]] and [[Yuirwood]]. In the [[Hordelands]], they could be found on the [[Katakoro Plateau]] [[High Meadows]], and [[Central Steppe]]. In the land of [[Anauroch]], they could be found in the fertile reaches of the [[Plain of Standing Stones]] as well as the bordering [[Desertsmouth Mountains]].

[[File:Arctic boar.jpg|thumb|''An arctic boar from the frozen north.'']]
Beyond [[Faerûn]] they could be found on the island of [[Evermeet]], where they were non-hostile towards elves and occasionally hunted by [[gold elves]]. On the continent of [[Laerakond]], boars could be found in [[Eskorn]], [[Fimbrul]], and [[Relmaur]]. In [[Zakhara]] they could be found in the land's hills and badlands.<ref> White-furred arctic boars were known to inhabit [[Icewind Dale]] and the [[Frozenfar]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], boars could be found in the [[Feywild]], the [[Cavern of Rest]]. They were particularly known to act as guards in this [[divine realm]] of [[Marthammor Duin]].

* It was quite common for high-end establishments in the Realms to serve a whole roasted wild boar as the seventh part of a full-course meal.
* In [[Neverwinter]], boar meat was one of the many common fillings used in savory pies<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-11-25 - Neverwinter Cuisine}} and in [[sausage]]s.{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|93}}

==History==
A petrified boar was kept on the [[Arcane Chambers]] level of [[Undermountain]] by [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]].

Members of the [[church of Silvanus]] often encouraged the hunting and eating of boar under the belief that the nobles who owned forests which were good for hunting would take efforts to preserve or expand those woodlands.
