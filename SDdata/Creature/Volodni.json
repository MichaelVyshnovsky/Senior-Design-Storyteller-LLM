        "mainbody": "The '''volodni''', or '''pine folk''', were sentient [[plant creature]]s native to the cold forests of [[Northeast Faerûn]], particularly the [[Forest of Lethyr]].",
        "Description": "The volodni were generally tall and slender but with broad shoulders and long arms. Their eyes were a solid, shiny black, and their skin was dark green like fresh [[pine]] needles. Their hair grew in long strands that had bark-like scales. They wore armor made of [[Leather armor|leather]] and wood.",
        "Behavior": "The volodni were stern defenders of the forests they considered their homelands and sought revenge on any who encroached on their territory or cut down trees. They had long memories and the relentless patience of nature. Some volodni bargained with settlers for limited use of forest resources, but they were in the minority.",
        "Combat": "Volodni fought with grim determination and gave no mercy. They used weapons made of wood, leather, or stone, and favored [[flail]]s for melee and [[javelin]]s for ranged combat. Veterans usually had armor and weapons made from [[bluewood]]. Piercing weapons were not very effective against their tough skin and their woody flesh made them immune to paralysis and being stunned. Their sap-like blood made them immune to [[poison]] and their plant-based physiology was proof against ''[[sleep]]'' effects and [[:Category:Mind-affecting spells|mind-affecting spells]]. They required little in the way of sleep (two hours a day, unless preparing spells) or food and water, as they were able to draw sustenance from their surroundings. Volodni could hold perfectly still and blend into most wooded environments.",
        "Society": "Organized in tribes, usually with a [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] as a leader, the volodni lived in small groups in groves that were cultivated to their liking, with few material possessions. A skilled [[ranger]] typically led any military excursions, backed up by [[warrior]]s and [[fighter]]s. They respected druids, even those of the \"warm folk\", and often formed alliances to prevent forest depredations. They honored [[treant]]s and were friendly with most other forest dwellers, including [[centaur]]s, [[satyr]]s, and [[elves]], although elves generally did not approve of the volodni tendency toward cold, ruthless killing of their perceived enemies. The more moderate volodni acknowledged the difference between using resources and impacting the environment out of necessity (most [[human]]s and [[dwarves]]) rather than maliciousness (most [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s), but the more militant ones did not. One faction of volodni thought they should retreat into the forest and avoid contact with outsiders, while most of the others sought to expand their territory with visions of covering the land in one vast forest.\n\nThe volodni did not build many enclosed structures, but stone circles and hearths open to the sky were common.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the [[-150 DR|Year of Recompense, −150 DR]], a group of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] refugees fled from the effects of the [[Great Conflagration (war)|Great Conflagration]] into a nearby ancient forest. Inside they were met by a powerful entity associated with that forest—an elder [[treant]] or perhaps, [[Silvanus]] himself—who gave them an ultimatum. They would forever have to give up their [[Nar demonbinder|demon-binding]] ways and accept the blood of the forest as their own or they would be ejected from the wood. The Nar lord leading those men and women agreed immediately, fearing what would happen should they be forced back into the open and so he and his followers were transformed into the first volodni."
