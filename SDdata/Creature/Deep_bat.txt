'''Deep bats''' were a broad classification of [[bat]] that were native to the [[Underdark]].

Despite their origins, they could be found on both the surface and below it. Although deep bats in general were rare to find, they were categorized into five main species, each exhibiting distinct behaviors and appearances.

[[Drow]] [[wizards]] often took deep bats as [[familiars]].

The types of deep bats were:
* [[Azmyth]]
* [[Bonebat]]
* [[Night hunter]], also known as a dragazhar
* [[Sinister]]
* [[Werebat]]
