'''Shadow beasts''' were a class of [[outsider]] native to the [[Shadowfell|Plane of Shadow]]. They included the four-armed, cat-like [[ghirrash]]; the ferocious crocodilian [[khumat]]; and the powerful elephantine [[thaskor]]. Shadow beasts were sometimes called [[fiend]]s, but this was a misconception.

==Personality==
Shadow beasts, unlike the fiends for which they were sometimes mistaken, were not necessarily evil. They ranged in outlook from the chaotic ghirrash, to the dim-witted but evil khumat, to the lawful and cruel thaskor.

==Abilities==
All shadow beasts possessed [[darkvision]]. They spoke the [[Abyssal language]], the [[Common]] language, and the [[Infernal language]]. Additionally, shadow beasts were immune to poison and resistant to attacks that utilized fire, lightning, cold, or acid.

==Society==
[[File:Thaskor.jpg|thumb|left|''A thaskor.'']]
Shadow beasts were natives of the Plane of Shadows, where they served various more powerful creatures, such as [[cloaker]]s, [[dread wraith]]s, [[nightshade]]s, and [[humanoid]]s that lived there. They typically worked as soldiers.

Shadow beasts were sometimes found on the [[Material Plane]] in the service of their masters, or as mercenaries.

Among themselves, the shadow beasts did not fight each other, but also refused to work together in the same company. While on the Material Plane, however, they were known to cooperate; khumats in particular were better at working with either ghirrashes or thaskors.

==Notable Shadow Beasts==
By early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], a khumat and the ghirrash [[Jherremor]] were aiding the [[church of Shar]] at the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]] in the Material Plane and at the [[Shadow Citadel]] in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the Shadow Plane. They were presumed to have been slain when adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] assaulted these compounds.
