The '''rathrea''' were [[dragon]]s transformed by a secret ritual performed in [[Skelkor]] in [[Laerakond]]. [[Dragonborn]] called them '''ghost dragons'''.<ref group="note">Not to be confused with [[ghost dragon]]s.

==Description==
Rathrea were created when dragons failed to awaken after having consumed [[Arambar (energy)|arambar]]. Those dragons eventually transformed into wraith-like, incorporeal glowing white spirits who had the ability to divine the future. This ability was limited to certain areas of information and timespans.

The rathrea didn't live for much time, fading away in a few weeks. According to [[Gauwervyndhal]], those rathrea "ascended" after they disappeared.

==History==
The Empress Dragon Gauwervyndhal forced many of her dragon servants, even her own children, to consume arambar in order to commune with the dead [[primordial]] [[Arambar]] to obtain lost knowledge.
