A '''kestrel''' was a type of [[bird]] and one of several distinct species of [[falcon]].

==Description==
Some, though not all, species sported a blue-crest.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Kestrels were a predatory bird, often feasting upon various species of rodents, [[rabbit]]s, and [[vole]]s.
===Habitats===
The blue-crested variety of kestrels inhabited the continent of [[Kara-Tur]]. 

In [[north Faerûn]], kestrels could be found year-round in the land of [[Thar]]. In [[west Faerûn]], kestrels could be found in and around the [[High Moor]] during the warmer months, migrating south during the winter. This included the central Moorlands, the High Moor marshes, the [[Fire Marshes]], in and around the [[Highstar Lake]], around the [[Misty Forest]], the [[Red Cliffs]], and near the [[Serpent Hills]].<ref>

Beyond the [[Prime Material]], kestrels could be found alongside many other predatory birds as part of the hunting parties of [[Remnis]].

==Trivia==
* The [[T'u Lung]] city of [[Ha'chou]] sported a blue-crested kestrel on its city banner alongside an [[owl]] and [[hawk]].
* ''Circa'' [[1358 DR]] there was an adventuring company named for the birds, known as the [[Men of the Red Kestrel]].
