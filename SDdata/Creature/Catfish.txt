'''Catfish''', also called '''navalar''' in the [[Common tongue]]{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|93}} or '''barbjaws''',{{Cite web/Realmslore/Uthmere (Part Three): Daily and Nightly Life in Uthmere}} were a carnivorous variety of game [[fish]]. They were among the most commonly eaten fish in [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Catfish generally had grayish-brown scales They varied in size from very diminutive to huge, In some cases, these whiskers secreted [[poison]]s of varying toxicity.

Some catfish could cross short patches of dry land.{{Cite dragon/267/Dragon's Bestiary: Designing Dungeon Monsters|65}} Other varietals of catfish were [[Electricity|electric]] and could deliver powerful shocks to stun or kill both prey and predator. Scholars were unsure whether the source of this electric shock was mundane or [[magic]]al.

===Species===
====Drusk====
A species of slow, brown-colored, flat-head catfish found throughout [[Faerûn]] and which were known for being good to eat.{{Cite dragon/334/Crimmor: City of Caravans|23}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/11-28 - Crimmor Clarifications}} Although the name "drusk" was used in [[Amn]] and was widespread throughout the Realms thanks to being used by traders, local names differed: for example, they were known as "sarl" in [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], and [[Sembia]] and as "amaulings" or "amaul" in the coastal rivers of [[Tethyr]].

====Giant Catfish====
Some mutant catfish could grow so large as to be called [[giant catfish]]. These usually could only be found in very large freshwater rivers and lakes and tended to be aggressive toward anything that might fit inside their mouths.

====Irrinda====
[[File:Neverwinter - Irrinda.webp|thumb|''Irrinda'']]
A common electric catfish found within the shallow rivers of the northern [[Chultan peninsula]]. Despite its diminutive size, it was capable of discharging a shock that would paralyze or kill the smaller fish on which it preyed.

====Likoto====
[[File:Neverwinter - Likoto.webp|thumb|''Likoto'']]
Another common electric catfish found in the rivers of [[Chult]], the likoto was a scavenger that was equally at home in slow or fast-moving waters. They were small and had the unusual habit of swimming upside-down in order to better feed on the bottom of floating debris, such as fallen logs.

====Minjiriya====
[[File:Minjiriya.webp|thumb|''Minjiriya'']]
A large species of electric catfish found within the riverways of the northern Chultan peninsula, the minjiriya was able to discharge an electric shock powerful enough to kill an adult [[human]]. [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] fishers were suitably wary of them.

====Spiny Sleeper====
The [[spiny sleeper]] was a toxic cousin to the catfish that could be found in the [[Great Glacier]].

====Stalking Catfish====
The [[stalking catfish]] was a cousin to the giant catfish that could be found within the [[Underdark]], and which could survive outside of water for a considerable time.

====Verme====
Another cousin to the giant catfish, [[verme]] were large carnivorous predators characterized by their large scales and needle-like teeth. They could be found in the tropical and subtropical waters of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Ecology==
Many types of catfish were found throughout freshwater lakes and riverbeds in temperate, warm, subtropical, and tropical environments.

Catfish were primarily scavengers and bottom-feeders, Some also hunted and fed on smaller species of fish, which occasionally made them competition for communities who also ate those same fish.{{Cite dragon/116/By Tooth and Claw|63}}

They were a favorite food of [[catoblepas]] and [[crocodile]]s.

===Habitats===
Catfish could be found from the temperate, subtropical, and tropical freshwaters of Kara-Tur (notably in the [[Dreaming River]] on the [[Malatran Plateau]]){{Cite organized play/LJ/The Necromancer's Stone|6}} and the Chultan peninsula (notably in the [[River Soshenstar]] and in [[Lake Grunglung]]) to the much colder waters of northern Faerûn, such as the streams and rivers of Amn (notably in the [[Alandor River]]), Cormyr and Sembia (notably in the [[Starwater River]]), the [[Dessarin Valley]] (notably in the [[River Dessarin]] itself, but also the [[Laughingflow]] and the [[River Surbrin]]), the [[Moonshae Isles]], and the [[Western Heartlands]] (notably in the [[River Chionthar]]),{{Cite digital book/Under Fallen Stars||19}} as well as in [[Highstar Lake]] of the [[High Moor]] and the great lake of [[Moonsea (lake)|the Moonsea]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|7}} They could occasionally be found in saltwater environments, such as the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

Catfish could be found in the shallow streams branching off of the [[River Styx]] on the [[Cosmology|plane]] of [[Pandemonium]], and such specimens could grow to surprising size.

===Uses===

A plump catfish could provide a good meal for two adults. They were widely eaten in Faerûn, in the Underdark; [[Nixie]]s kept herds of catfish as food, alongside the likes of [[bass]] and [[trout]]. [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] citadels were said to sometimes maintain cisterns where they raised blind catfish and trout meant to serve as food in case of a siege. They were also kept by the [[grung]] of Chult.

As a game fish, they were recreationally fished in places like Cormanthor,

Whether for food or for sport, anglers sought to catch catfish with bait ranging from [[leatherjacket]]s and [[Earthworm|nightcrawler]]s to moldy [[cheese]] and pieces of fat. Some Faerûnian fishers had a method for hunting catfish that involved reaching one's hand directly into a suspected den. This method was not only discouraged but mocked by fishers in places like Chult, where electric catfish like the minjiriya could kill someone who attempted it.

==History==
The dwarven city of [[Iltkazar (city)|Iltkazar]], built during the height of [[Shanatar]], maintained drainage pits in which catfish were raised as a food source.

During the height of the [[elf|elven]] empire of [[Cormanthyr]], catfish was considered a feasting food and a delicacy in some circles.

Catfish were eaten in ancient [[Netheril]], and could be purchased from fishmongers at [[Low Netheril|Low Netherese]] markets like those in [[Dalekeva]]. Prior to the creation of the [[Anauroch]] desert, they could be found in Netheril's [[Moray River]].

In Wa, a magic stream on the [[Fochu Peninsula]] was known as the [[Catfish Stream]]. Anyone who leapt into the stream while holding a [[sack]] filled with a handful of [[blue mahogany]] dust had a chance of a catfish manifesting within the sack. In some cases, a message might be visible on catfish's scales, while in some other cases, the scales might instead be poisonous to the touch.

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], poor villagers in places like [[Bogbrook]] in Cormyr and [[Uthmere]] in the [[Great Dale]] caught their own catfish, making it an important source of food. In urban restaurants in the Realms, fresh catfish could be ordered for 5 [[copper piece]]s, meaning it was one of the more affordable fish.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Imaraska]] made use of [[illusory]] flying catfish to scout and patrol for her.{{Cite adventurers league/Wings of Death|22}}
