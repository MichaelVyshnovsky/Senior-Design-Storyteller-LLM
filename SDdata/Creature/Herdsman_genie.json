        "Description": "These sociable genies were short and wiry with heavy brows. Years of sun exposure left their skin dark and tanned. Herdsman genies often smelled like their animals but with a slight rancid odor because of all of the [[milk]] products that they consumed.",
        "Combat": "These genies only entered combat for self defense or in defense of their herds. They were proficient with a variety of weaponry including [[short bow]]s, [[spear]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[lasso]]s. They could use the following spell-like abilities: ''[[phantom steed]]'', ''[[dust devil]]'', ''[[remove fear]]'', and ''[[flame brand]]''.\n\nHerdsman genies were adept at firing bows from the back of a horse or camel while riding at full speed.\n\nIn desperate situations a herdsman genie would attempt to create a stampede and charge an enemy.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Most of their diet consisted of blood carefully taken from their charges. Animal milk was used to make a wide variety of food as well.",
            "Relationships": "Herdsman genies moved often if grazing was not suitable for their animals. They did not care for artificial boundaries created by [[humanoid]]s, which often led them into conflicts."
