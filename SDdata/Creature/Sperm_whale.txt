'''Sperm whales''', also known as '''cachalots''', were large carnivorous whales.
==Abilities==
Sperm whales were powerful swimmers. They could swim up to {{SI|36|mi|k|long=yes}} in a single day, and dive to a depth of {{SI|3000|ft|long=yes}}{{Cite dragon/190/Deep Beneath the Waves|19}} 
==Behavior==
Sperm whales lived in groups called pods. They communicated with each other via whale-song. They maintained positive relations with good-aligned sentient aquatic species. Sperm whales were curious about surface-dwelling [[humanoids]] but cautious around those who hunted whales.
==Combat==
Sperm whales defended themselves by using their massive tail as a weapon.{{Cite dragon/198/Campaign Journal: Scimitars against the Dark|71}}
==Habitat==
Sperm whales lived in oceans and seas. They were known to inhabit the waters of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].
==Biology==
Sperm whales were carnivorous and hunted large fish and octopuses.
==Uses==
Sperm whales naturally produced spermaceti. This waxy substance was used by [[wizard]]s to craft white candles that were used in spellcasting. Additionally, sperm whales produced ambergris, which was very rare and could sell for up to 20,000 [[gp]]. Due to their habit of swallowing entire boats whole, treasure could be found within the stomach of a sperm whale.{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|18}} 
==Notable Sperm Whales==
* [[Angajuk]], a talking sperm whale that had the ability to speak [[Common]].
