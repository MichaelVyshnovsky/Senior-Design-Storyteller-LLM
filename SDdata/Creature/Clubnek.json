        "mainbody": "lubneks were an uncommon, mutated sub-species of ostrich.\nUnlike the standard ostrich, these creatures had hard, bony yellow beaks and their feathers came in various shades of green. They occasionally bursted into high-speed sprints.\nClubneks were typically non-aggressive unless threatened, though their behavior was very erratic and hard to predict.\nClubneks attacked by using their hard beaks and large talons.\nClubneks were primarily known to be a herbivorous species.\nThough they could on occasion be found underground, clubneks primarily resided within forests and meadowlands.\nIn Faer√ªn they could be found in the medium woods of Daggerdale, Cormanthor, and Shadowdale. Particularly in the Border Forest and Vale of Lost Voices."
