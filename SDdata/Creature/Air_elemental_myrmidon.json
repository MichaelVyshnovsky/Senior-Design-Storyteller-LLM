They acted as servile weapons of war.{{MyrmidonArchon-Connection}}",
        "Description": "Air myrmidons were beings composed entirely of elemental air, with bodies that were roughly [[human]] in size and shape.\n\nLike all elemental myrmidons, they wore thick armor, typically of a [[plate mail|plate]] variety.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} Their armor was all that would remain of them when killed.",

        "Abilities": "Air myrmidons were immune to the effects of [[disease]]s and [[poison]]s, as they were composed wholly of elemental essence.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|43}} \n\nThey had some resistance to lightning-based [[spell]]s or abilities, as well as ones that were sonic-based. They also had innate abilities allowing them to temporarily imbue their weapons with electrical energy and speed around the battlefield.\n\nZephyrhaunts could transform themselves into raging cyclones, flinging away the enemies they moved through, while tempestblades could encase themselves in an aura of screaming winds that turned aside all weaponry lunged at them.",
        "Combat": "The standard variety of air myrmidon, zephyrhaunts, typically fought with [[spiked chain]]s or a [[flail]] with spikes on its chain. While those known as tempestblades typically fought with [[longsword]]s. Sometimes these were imbued with electrical energy, but regardless of what weapon an air myrmidon used, it was considered [[magic item|magical]].\n\nThey typically used hit-and-run tactics. Assaulting their enemies with a barrage of strikes before harrying away to attack another target, as well as maneuvering their adversaries into flanked positions.\nposition.",
        "History": "{{main|Elemental myrmidon#History}}\n\nDuring the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis, air myrmidons and their variants were utilized by members of one of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis, the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]].",

These forges rarely appeared like a common forge, being unrecognizable contraptions of [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[elemental magic]].\n\nA working foundry could produce them as often as the ritual could be performed and for as long as the foundry's resources were maintained. The forge's power determine what kind of myrmidon was created.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|44}} A forge with ebbing power could only generate the most basic of air myrmidons, while those at high flow could produce more powerful varieties,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} such as tempestblades.",
