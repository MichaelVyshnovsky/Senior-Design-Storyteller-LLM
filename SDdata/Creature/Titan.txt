'''Titans''', called '''''voninjotunen''''' in their own language, were the largest of the [[true giant]] races, standing even taller than [[Cloud giant|cloud]] or [[storm giant]]s. In the social order of giants, they were ranked highest on the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]], above all other giants, [[giant-kin]], and [[ogre]]s.

==Description==
Titans resembled large, muscular [[human]]s who typically lacked facial hair.

==Personality==
Titans were typically some of the most intelligent of giants.

==Abilities==
Many titans were capable [[spellcaster]]s or [[psionicist]]s.<ref group="note" name="distinction">Realms sources did not make an effort to denote the distinction between the titans of [[Lanaxis]] and the titans of Greek myth. The latter were clearly the basis for the titans detailed in monster manuals&mdash;their write up in 2nd edition explicitly talks of [[Olympus]] and Greek clothing, plus the setting-neutral book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' states they have an affinity for the [[Greek pantheon]]. Because of all this, it's hard to say whether or not this info truly applies to the titans of Toril.. And they were the only race of giants not known to have [[runecaster]]s.

They also had numerous spell-like abilities. Such as [[holy smite]], [[meteor swarm]], and [[chain lightning]].<ref group="note" name="distinction" /> Some were capable of becoming [[invisibility|invisible]] at will, [[levitate|levitating]], and becoming ethereal at least twice a day.<ref group="note" name="distinction" />

==Combat==
Titans typically wielded a huge [[warhammer]] but also carried [[javelin]]s to throw.

==History==
The titan race began with an individual by the name of [[Lanaxis]], one of the mortal children of [[Annam All-Father]] and [[Othea]].

Around {{Yearlink|-31500}}, a titan thane named [[Omo]] was engaged in combat with [[Zhoukoudien]], leader of the [[Batrachi]]. Omo ended up slaying him and inciting war between their people. The titans would come to dominate the batrachi in this war and, according to [[Abeir]]an scholars, it would lead the latter to perform a powerful summoning ritual that culminated in the [[Tearfall]].

When Annam founded the kingdom of [[Ostoria]] he ceded control of the plains to Lanaxis, who would found the dynasty of the titans, east of the [[Great Rift]] in the land of [[Eastern Shaar]]. The titans and storm giants would create some of Ostoria's greatest cities, featuring mechanical conveyances and galleries that would house artistic tributes to all giantkind.<ref>

The eventual disappearance of titans on [[Abeir-Toril]] was a matter of speculation. According to one myth popularized by the [[book]], ''[[History of the Last March of the Giants]]'', the titans grew so arrogant that they challenged the [[gods]]. They in turn cursed their monarch with fascination and his subjects with absolute devotion to him. They then sent a star crashing down to the planet and through their nation, causing widespread catastrophes and leaving a huge valley that became the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

Being cursed with curiosity, the then-king of the titans chased after the star and his dutiful subjects followed suit. They chased it all the way to the [[Great Sea]] and then dove in after it, never to be seen again.

==Society==
===Homelands===
Following the fall of Ostoria, titans were primarily found on [[plane]]s other than the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]], such as [[Arborea]] and [[Warrior's Rest]].

===Languages===
As inhabitants of the [[Outer Planes]], titans were often known to be capable of speaking the [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]] and [[Celestial language|Celestial]] languages. Many were also known to speak [[Draconic language|Draconic]], [[Common]], and all six dialects of [[Giant language|Giant]].

===Relationships===
Out of all the giant races, titans were the most amicable towards storm giants due to their disposition.

==Notable Titans==

* [[Omo]]
