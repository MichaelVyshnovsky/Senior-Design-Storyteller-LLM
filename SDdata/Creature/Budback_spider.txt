Budback spiders were vermin from the Khopet-Dag mountains in the Hordelands.
These spiders were about the size of a human thumb.
Budback spiders liked to bite whenever they were annoyed. They were poisonous, but their poison was not harmful, not even if dozens of them were involved. It took a whole swarm of them biting for their poison to incapacitate a man. However, they did not swarm naturally, though magic could compel them to form such a swarm.
On the night of Tarsakh 15, in the , the druid Berun used budback spiders to incapacitate several assassins.
