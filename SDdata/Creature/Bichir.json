        "mainbody": "A '''bichir''', also called a '''giant lungfish''' or '''marsh lizard''', was a large fish found in many swamps. It was a giant cousin of the common [[Wikipedia:lungfish|lungfish]].",
        "Description": "Bichir were very large and had long, thick bodies. They had large jaws filled with razor-sharp teeth. Their scales were smooth and colored to allow camouflage with the murky water of swamps. Their eyes were black, set in a broad and flat head. They had fins that ran along their backs, ending in a broad tail.",
        "Combat": "The bichir could hunt on land as well as in the water. On land its movement was slow; the fish used its body to slither and fins to aid in movement. It would use its sense of smell to track prey. The bichir would strike with sudden forward movement, attacking its prey with its powerful teeth. It never swallowed prey whole, preferring to drag it back to the water and consume it in pieces. In water, the bichir's sense of sight was superior and was able to spot prey from a distance of eighty yards. On land its vision abilities were reduced and it could only see about twenty yards. It would hunt amphibians, large animals, fish, and insects, but the bichir's favorite prey was [[lizardfolk]]. \n\nThe bichir had the ability to cast an ''[[entangle]]'' spell on its prey, with a range of sixty yards. It could only use it up to six times in a twenty-four hour period. This spell was also the primary defensive measure of the bichir while on land.\n\nDespite having a natural resistance to [[magic]] attacks, the bichir feared magic and magic users, and would flee any creature with magical abilities or artefacts.",
