'''Winged horrors''' were a variety of flying [[ghoul]]s that were encountered throughout the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
While they resembled ghouls in appearance and structure, winged horrors were smaller and weighed less than their land-bound cousins.

==Behavior==
These creatures were commanded by [[Absolutist]]s to swoop down and seize important assets or kidnap individuals.

==Abilities==
They could fly at a rate of {{SI|600|ft}} per minute.

==Combat==
Like other ghouls, winged horrors could [[paralyze]] foes with their bite. Certain races such as [[elves]] and other [[undead]] were immune to this effect.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ex-[[Flaming Fist]] soldier [[Marcus (Flaming Fist)|Marcus]] led several winged horrors in his planned abduction of [[Isobel Thorm|Isobel]], for General [[Ketheric Thorm]].

==Notable Locales==
A pair of winged horrors preferred to perch atop the battlements of [[Moonrise Towers]].
