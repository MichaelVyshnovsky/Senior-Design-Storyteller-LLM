        "mainbody": "Phase spiders were monstrous arachnid-kin that dwelt within the Ethereal Plane. They made quick forays into the natural world to snatch an unlucky creature to feed upon. Those stolen by phase spiders were never seen again and were regarded as unsolved disappearances.\nThe phase spider resembled a giant wolf spider with blue, gray, and white coloration. It had a relatively larger head than a natural spider, with eight silver-white eyes. Phase spiders were about  long and weighed about .\nPhase spiders transported between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane for the purpose of hunting. It looked for a likely spot in the Ethereal Plane, and then teleported (its form of teleportation was known as \"phasing,\" hence the name) to the Material Plane, presumably ambushing travelers it expected to be there, biting and killing them, and then quickly retreating back to the Ethereal Plane.\nThey could not speak. They were regarded as neutral in alignment.\nIn the , a small group of drow arachnomancers took over one of ancient Illefarn ruins, interestingly enough, located in the deep jungles of Samarach of the Chultan Peninsula. Even though their goal remained a mystery, they brought a pack of phase spiders with them and kept the deadly creatures in the top levels of the ruined structure."
