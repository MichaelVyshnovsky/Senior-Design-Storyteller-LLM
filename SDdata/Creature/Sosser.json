        "mainbody": "The '''Sosser''' was a mixed-breed of unsophisticated [[horse]]s found throughout [[Thar]] and the [[Cold Lands]] in [[northeast Faerûn]]. They were a cross between a [[steppe horse]] and other breeds that were favorable for farming.",
        "Description": "These horses were sure-footed, strong and highly resilient to the freezing colds of the north. They had long necks, narrow heads and broad hooves.",
        "Usage": "Heavily bred in the harsh farms of the cold [[North Faerûn|northern lands]] of Faerûn, Sossers were capable of pulling a wagon alone, where two work-horses were typically required. They were quite inexpensive, and could be purchased for around 90 [[gp]]."
