        "mainbody": "The Sosser was a mixed-breed of unsophisticated horses found throughout Thar and the Cold Lands in northeast Faerûn. They were a cross between a steppe horse and other breeds that were favorable for farming.\nThese horses were sure-footed, strong and highly resilient to the freezing colds of the north. They had long necks, narrow heads and broad hooves.\nHeavily bred in the harsh farms of the cold northern lands of Faerûn, Sossers were capable of pulling a wagon alone, where two work-horses were typically required. They were quite inexpensive, and could be purchased for around 90 gp."
