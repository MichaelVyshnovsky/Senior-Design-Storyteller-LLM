        "mainbody": "Djim were a type of memedi native to Kara-Tur.\nDjim were incorporeal and resembled a balding aged human male. They wore prayer robes that flowed just past their feet. When encountered, djim avoided making eye contact and were heard constantly murmuring religious chants.\nDjim were gentle and calm.\nLike all common memedi, djim were harmless and avoided all combat. If attacked, they merely vanished.\nIf a human saw a djim unexpectedly, they were struck with an effect similar to that of a fear spell.\nDjim were solitary creatures. They most often appeared at funerals for nobles and other important males in Kara-Tur. They only appeared at a funeral if a complex ritual was performed exactly as required. This ritual had slight variations based on local funeral customs. The djims duty was to escort the spirit of the deceased to the spirit world.\nDjim were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of Bawa and other islands within the Island Kingdoms. \nDjim were the spirits of priests."
