        "Personality": "Djim were gentle and calm.",
        "Combat": "Like all common memedi, djim were harmless and avoided all combat. If attacked, they merely vanished.",

        "Society": "Djim were solitary creatures. They most often appeared at funerals for nobles and other important males in Kara-Tur. They only appeared at a funeral if a complex ritual was performed exactly as required. This ritual had slight variations based on local funeral customs. The djim's duty was to escort the spirit of the deceased to the spirit world.",
        "Habitat": "Djim were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of [[Bawa]] and other islands within the [[Island Kingdoms]].",
        "Ecology": "Djim were the spirits of [[priest]]s."
