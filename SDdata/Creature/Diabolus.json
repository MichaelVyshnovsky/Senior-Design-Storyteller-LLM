        "mainbody": "'''Diaboli''' (singular: '''Diabolus''') were a race of people native to the [[Demiplane of Nightmares]], where they filled the same niche [[human]]s did on the [[Material Plane]].",
        "Description": "Diaboli were vaguely humanoid in form, averaging about {{SI|6|ft}} tall, but possessed goat-like legs, pointed ears, and small, vestigial horns. They also had long tails that ended in a barb. Their hands were mostly normal but they lacked the smallest finger, instead only having three fingers and a thumb on each hand. Diaboli had reptilian eyes that ranged from bright red to yellow in color. Their skin ranged in color from pale mauve or lavender to near-black violet. They had forked tongues. Diaboli varied in how much hair grew on their bodies: bare diaboli had no hair at all, common diaboli had more normal amounts of hair, and hirsute diaboli also had coarse, goat-like hair growing from the waist down.",
        "Abilities": "Diaboli possessed [[darkvision]]. Additionally, their forked tongues provided an enhanced sense of smell and some sense of heat detection.\n\nAccording to some sources, diaboli were not affected by magic cast by creatures from the Material plane, and diaboli magic likewise did not affect creatures of the Material plane. However, indirect uses of magic could be wielded against them, and magic used by other creatures from the Demiplane of Nightmares, such as [[neh-thalggu]], [[feyr]]s, [[nagpa]]s, and [[maelephant]]s, still affected them.",
        "Personality": "Diaboli had a wide range of personalities among themselves, but by and large they tended to be rather chaotic, if benign; this manifested in the form of extreme absent-mindedness, mild to severe mood swings, wild bouts of creativity, and otherwise mercurial personalities. However, they strongly believed in the ancient traditions and mores that held their societies together.",
        "Combat": "Diaboli martial technology and techniques were not as advanced as those of the cultures of the Material plane, but most were skilled with the [[trident]]. Additionally, diaboli could attack with their tail barb, which was mildly poisonous.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Diaboli spoke their own language, called Diabolan. This language made frequent use of harsh, guttural hisses and the unique physiology of their forked tongues, making it difficult for most humanoids of the Material plane to learn. Most words contained soft \"f\", \"s\", \"th\", and \"z\" sounds, among other, stranger ones. However, the same physiology that made it difficult for humanoids to learn Diabolan also made it difficult for diaboli to learn [[Common]], and even those that did manage spoke it with a thick, serpentine accent. Typically, a diabolus might learn [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]], Common, [[Draconic language|Draconic]], or [[Infernal language|Infernal]]. Additionally, diaboli had a tail code, a method of communicating simple ideas through the positioning and twirling of their tails.",
            "Religion": "Diaboli had no established religion, instead revering ideas such as anarchy, chaos, freedom, and wonder. [[Cleric]]s existed, though they were very rare.",
            "Relationships": "The [[neh-thalggu]] occupied a place in diabolus legends similar to the one dragons held in human legends. Diaboli regarded neh-thalggu as creatures of great power, cunning, and inscrutability. Additionally, neh-thalggu were some of the few creatures whose magic could affect a diabolus.<ref>\n\nIn the [[Mystara]]n nation of [[Glantri]], those who could trace their lineage back to diaboli were afforded a higher social status.<ref>"
