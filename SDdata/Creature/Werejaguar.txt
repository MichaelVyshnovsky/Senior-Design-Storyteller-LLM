A '''werejaguar''' was an extremely rare [[lycanthrope]] that was found in at least one part of [[Maztica]].

==Description==
Werejaguars were [[human]]s that could [[shapechange]] into [[jaguar]]s. These intelligent [[shapechanger]]s, which were similar to [[weretiger]]s, were found in jungles or tropical forests. In their human form, werejaguars had triangular faces that were somewhat distorted. They had wide eyes and usually carried toothy grins.

==Combat==
They were somewhat similar to [[wereleopard]]s, being able to strike with their claws from a crouch. However, they were noted to to be more powerful than wereleopards. Unlike weretigers, they could be harmed by normal [[weapon]]s.

==Ecology==
They were found, though rarely, in the [[Narabatun Jungle]] of Maztica. Beyond [[Toril]], this variety of lycanthrope could be found in the tropical jungles of [[Mystara]].<ref>
