A werejaguar was an extremely rare lycanthrope that was found in at least one part of Maztica.
Werejaguars were humans that could shapechange into jaguars. These intelligent shapechangers, which were similar to weretigers, were found in jungles or tropical forests. In their human form, werejaguars had triangular faces that were somewhat distorted. They had wide eyes and usually carried toothy grins.
They were somewhat similar to wereleopards, being able to strike with their claws from a crouch. However, they were noted to to be more powerful than wereleopards. Unlike weretigers, they could be harmed by normal weapons.
They were found, though rarely, in the Narabatun Jungle of Maztica. Beyond Toril, this variety of lycanthrope could be found in the tropical jungles of Mystara.
