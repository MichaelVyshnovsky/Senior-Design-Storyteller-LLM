A '''giant crocodile''' was a larger and more powerful version of a [[crocodile]].

==Description==
Giant crocodiles were giant, beastly crocodiles. They were as physically strong as [[hill giant]]s and were exceptional swimmers, both above and beneath the surface of water. Underneath the surface, they could hold their breath for up to half an hour. In both scenarios, they were quite stealthy for their size and bulk. Giant crocodiles could grow up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} long; the older they were, the larger they got. In some environs, they were very rare, but in others they were common (though still much rarer than their smaller cousins).

==Combat==
These beasts purely relied on their natural weapons: ferocious bites and whips of their tails. Their bites grappled opponents until they found the strength to break out, and their quick tail whips could knock enemies prone. They were able to sneak up on prey and surprise them before launching an assault.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], a giant-crocodile-riding [[quasit]] roamed the sewers of [[Waterdeep]].

In [[1374 DR]], these creatures were used as guardians for the [[Shadowscale Warren]] in the Shadow Swamp.

==Ecology==
Much like their smaller versions, giant crocodiles either lived on their own or in small colonies.
===Diets===
These huge creatures often hunted inhabitants that lurked in saltwater environments, such as [[shark]]s and small-sized [[whale]]s. They were also known to attack fishing boats by trying to capsize them, and then eat all the already-caught fish.
===Habitats===
Giant crocodiles were spotted in many places over [[Toril]] in the continents of [[Faer√ªn]], [[Maztica]], and [[Zakhara]].{{Cite dungeon/57/The Rose Of Jumlat}} Beyond the Zakharan mainland, giant crocodiles could be found in the [[Crowded Sea]] on the island of [[Djinni's Claws]].

In the [[Kara-tur]] region, they could be found in the rivers of [[Akari|Akari island]].

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], they were noted to dwell in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] and on the [[Krigala]] layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].<ref>

===Usage===
The crushed scales of these giant beasts were used in the powerful ''[[jungle avatar]]'' [[spell]] by Zakharan [[priest]]s.

==Notable Giant Crocodiles==
* [[Kheshebik]], a giant crocodile that was believed to be an avatar of [[Semuanya]] by the [[Khoroshen]] [[lizardfolk]] tribe.{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|24-26}}

==Trivia==
* [[Sebek]] of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] was known to appear as a giant crocodile. As such, his worshipers believed that the smile of such a creature showed that they were either favored or disfavored. Some of his prominent worshipers gained the ability to transform into these creatures.
* Those who specialized in sea-based [[magic]] could [[summon]] a giant crocodile with the [[spell]] ''[[monster summoning V]]''.{{Cite dragon/220/Arcane Lore: Sea Magic|72}}
