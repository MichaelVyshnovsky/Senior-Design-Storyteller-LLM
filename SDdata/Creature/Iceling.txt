'''Icelings''' were small [[winter fey|winter]] [[fey]] that lived in frozen regions of the [[Feywild]].

==Description==
Icelings resembled [[quickling]]s, but were covered in ice and possessed a pair of wings that resembled thin ice.

==Abilities==
Icelings were very fast, and were never affected by difficult terrain caused by ice or frozen ground. They could also teleport up to {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}. They were immune to damage inflicted by the cold.

Icelings possessed [[low-light vision]] and were known to speak the [[Common]] language.

==Personality==
Icelings were mischievous but cruel, and their sense of humor was better described as dark and dangerous.

==Combat==
Icelings preferred to rely on their speed in combat, using their claws in hit-and-run attacks.

==Society==
Icelings commonly served more powerful winter fey as servants and spies.

Some rumors claimed that all icelings served the [[archfey]] [[Koliada]], the Winter Witch, even those who ostensibly served other fey.
