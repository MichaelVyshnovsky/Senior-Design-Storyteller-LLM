A '''wererabbit''' was type of [[lycanthrope]] that could take the form of a [[rabbit]] or a rabbit-like [[humanoid]] hybrid.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-08-21/How many kinds of lycanthropes are there?}} They existed on [[Toril]] and in the [[Domains of Dread]], though like all lycanthropes derived from prey animals they were very rare.

==History==
Ravenloft's famed monster hunter, [[Rudolph van Richten]], once dismissed the existence of wererabbits in his seminal work ''[[Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts (in-universe)|Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts]]''. Therein he stated that they and any other lycanthropes derived from herbivores were merely figments of imagination, born by hallucinations and drunkards.
