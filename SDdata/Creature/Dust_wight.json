        "mainbody": "Dust wights were a type of undead creature that formed from conjunctions of elemental earth and negative energy.\nThese resembled earth elementals, albeit the size of a human and with gaunt forms. They were always surrounded by a small cloud of dust and despite their appearance they weighed around .\nDust wights sought to destroy all things constructed of metal or stone. They were pleased whenever it was necessary to kill living creatures in order to accomplish this.\nCreatures or objects constructed of metal or store, such as shield guardians and stone golems, would be weakened when bashed by the fists of a dust wight. In addition, the dust clouds that surrounded them had a petrification effect.\nDust wights were equally affected by turn undead and spells that rebuked creatures of elemental earth.\nIn the , a group of adventurers discovered some dust wights within an abandoned guardhouse inside the tomb of the Netherese scholar Augathra the Mad.\nDust wights only knew the Terran language."
