Some especially large giant dragonflies had 20 feet (6 meters) wingspans and body lengths. They had a remarkable brilliant, glittering coloration.\nThey were fearless against anyone of smaller size than themselves and suffered from a voracious appetite. They were rather hard to hit with missile weaponry due to their quick and darting movement.\nThe skin of the giant dragonflies was used for apparel and decoration, and could be quite valuable if properly preserved.\nThe larva of the giant dragonfly appeared to be toothless and inoffensive creatures that hid during their metamorphosis into adults. However, when provoked by creatures nearby, they would attack from their hiding places with their hard and very functional mandibles.\nAlways on the lookout for new prey, giant dragonflies were known to hunt humans and their like, thus posing a threat to the unwary. They would dart in and bite with their mandibles, then fly away and around so as to always face their opponents.\nIf their opponents were small or tiny, they would try to scoop them into their leg baskets and then simply devour them while on the wing.\nGiant dragonflies living in the Dead Marsh of Tu Lung, usually hunted the native giant carp for food.\nGiant dragonflies were found from temperate to warm climes and lived in marshy areas and other watery areas.\nFemale giant dragonflies could with time and effort be trained to allow people to ride them as flying mounts, if trained from hatching, while the males were far too territorial. Those who preferred to ride flying vermin, especially if they were raiders or bandits, preferred the giant dragonfly as they were rather docile compared to other fliers of such sort and had a very distinct thrumming sound that would announce the raiders presence to the common people, striking fear and terror.\nIn 1358 DR, a jiki-ketsu-gaki who laired in the Dead Marsh, had a group of five giant dragonflies under his command that he used to hunt down humans.\nThe Witchlight Carnival used giant dragonflies to give flights to attendees."
