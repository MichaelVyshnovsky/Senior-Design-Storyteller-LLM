        "mainbody": "Purplespawn nightmares were intelligent dragonspawn with kleptomaniac tendencies.\nPurplespawn nightmares were a monstrous mixture of deep dragon and drow, with thin, serpentine bodies covered in purple and black scales, and with long tails covered in spikes.\nAcutely aware and ashamed of their grotesque appearance, purplespawn nightmares preferred to hide themselves away in the Underdark, where they wandered around searching for food and plunder. Only their obsessive need to steal could compel them to leave their subterranean stomping grounds.\nOpportunistic by nature, purplespawn nightmares preferred to wait until their targets were fighting other creatures. They would then use their innate ability to copy their targets appearance to confuse their enemies, leaving them open for a swift attack with their spiked tails. Purplespawn nightmares could cause psychic damage to their opponents minds, and were in turn resistant to attacks of that nature. They could also regenerate, allowing them to rapidly recover from wounds."
