        "mainbody": "Maws of Acamar were a type of star spawn created by the dead star Acamar.\nMaws of Acamar were large, humanoid-shaped, and inky-black in color. Their solidity or lack thereof was unknown.\nMaws of Acamar had some strange powers that pulled creatures towards them, before destroying them as if in a void.\nThese star spawn relied solely on their innate magics in battle.\nMaws of Acamar were said to be the corpse stars hunger made manifest, and certainly, those enemies they killed were torn apart and pulled into Acamars own darkness. They entered the world when Acamars influence peaked and then proceeded to destroy/eat everything in their path."
