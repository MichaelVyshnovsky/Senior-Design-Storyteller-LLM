These were a group of light receptive cells that could register changes in light intensity, though not actual images. Because of this, giant leeches often reacted to changes in nearby light.{{Cite dragon/123/Ecology of the Giant Leech|52}}"

        "Combat": "Leeches typically hid themselves within the mud or slime typical of their habitats, then waited to strike upon any warm-blooded creature that passed them by.

        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' was known to sell [[jar]]s full of live leeches for 10 [[gp]].\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, a barber in [[Silverymoon]] by the name of [[Jooge Nopsmoth]] charged patrons a single gold piece to have blood extracted by means of leeches.

            "Habitats": "Leeches were only known to be found in the waters of temperate swamps and marshes. the [[Lake of Steam]], and the jungle within the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]]. They were also quite prevalent in the marshes of [[High Moor]].\n\nBeyond Faer√ªn, they could be found in pools of water all throughout [[Chu' Yuan]]. During the summer season, swarms of them could be found in the lakes, rivers, and swamps of the [[Ama Basin]]. And in the [[Crowded Sea]], they could be found on the island of [[Djinni's Claws]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], they could be found in the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze]] and the [[Domains of Dread]].",
            "Usage": "Many peoples in the Realms would turn to the use of leeches when traditional medicines didn't prove effective. This belief was so widespread that they had somewhat of a placebo effect. Some even claimed they could be used to cure [[lycanthropy]], though this was blatantly false."
