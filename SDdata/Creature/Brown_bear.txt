The '''brown bear''' was a forest-dwelling [[animal]].

{{Quote|Other types of bears have been seen upon the [[Sword Coast]], but most species mind their own business unless provoked!|[[Volothamp Geddarm]].<ref>{{Cite document/Sword Coast Survival Guide|32}}}}

==Description==
These creatures had brown fur. Brown bears on average were 9 ft (2.7 m) and weighed 1800 lb (816.5 kg).

Grizzly bears were reconsidered to be a much larger and much more territorial variant of an ordinary brown bear. They were significantly more dangerous especially if challenged or threatened.

==Behavior==
These omnivore ursoids were very dangerous and territorial. Brown bears that had very aggressive dispositions were known as ''grizzly'' bears.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
They inhabited and thrived within dark glades of [[the North]]'s many forests.

In the areas outside of [[Daggerford]], namely in the [[Western Farmlands]], aggressive and dangerous grizzly bears were known to inhabit burrows and caves not far from the [[Delimbiyr River]].

In the [[Unapproachable East]], brown bears could be found in the forests and along the coasts of [[Rashemen]].<ref>

Some were known to live within the [[Dustwall Mountains]] between [[Durpar]] and [[Raurin]].

==History==
An awakened brown bear lived on the [[Wyllowwood]] level of [[Undermountain]].

[[Maerovyna]], a [[druid]] of [[Chauntea]] who led the [[Harvest House]] in [[Daggerford]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], was served by two [[pixie]]s, a grizzly bear, and a [[leopard]] who were ready to defend her with their lives.
