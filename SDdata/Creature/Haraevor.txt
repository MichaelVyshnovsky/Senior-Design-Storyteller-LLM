'''Haraevors''' were a type of [[dragonspawn]] that were capable of traveling through solid stone. They were native to [[Abeir]].

==Description==
These reptilian beasts looked like enormous [[crocodile]]s with four heads.

==Behavior==
Haraevors primarily traveled underground, moving through stone and earth.

==Combat==
These creatures traveled through stone to gain advantage on their foes, then attacked with each of their four heads. They had enough self-preservation to flee underground when they were in grave danger.

==Ecology==
It was believed that the existence of haraevors was a result of breeding between [[earth titan]]s and [[dragon]]s, most likely [[gray dragon]]s.

==History==
The [[Order of the Dawn]] book, ''[[Primordials and their Servitors]]'', referred to haraevors as "crashing death from earth".
