Haraevors were a type of dragonspawn that were capable of traveling through solid stone. They were native to Abeir.
These reptilian beasts looked like enormous crocodiles with four heads.
Haraevors primarily traveled underground, moving through stone and earth.
These creatures traveled through stone to gain advantage on their foes, then attacked with each of their four heads. They had enough self-preservation to flee underground when they were in grave danger.
It was believed that the existence of haraevors was a result of breeding between earth titans and dragons, most likely gray dragons.
The Order of the Dawn book, Primordials and their Servitors, referred to haraevors as "crashing death from earth".
