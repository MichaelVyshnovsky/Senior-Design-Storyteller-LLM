Bone fiends were a type of fiend that could be found in a number of the lower planes.
Bone fiends slashed at their foes with long, bladed arms that infected others with disease.
They had inherent protection from the elements, physical harm, and even magic itself. They could only be harmed by magical weapons.
These fiends could be found on Avernus, the first level of the Nine Hells. A number of them dwelt within and around the Basalt Tower.
Bone fiends were used as minions by some of the more powerful Bhaalspawn members of the Five. Both Abazigal and Yaga-Shura were known to keep them within their respective domains in Tethyr.
After she seized the divine power of her patron deity Bhaal, Amelyssan the Blackhearted gained the ability to summon bone fiends within the Mana Forge in the Throne of Blood.
