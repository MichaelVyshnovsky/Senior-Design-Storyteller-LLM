        "mainbody": "Horses on Toril came in a number of breeds, of varying size and demeanor. They were often used by humanoid races for riding, the pulling of carts and wagons or other forms of work.\nHorses were classified in a number of different manners. Chargers, or more plainly warhorses were those horses bred to ride in battle. Light warhorses were referred to as coursers while heavy warhorses were known as destriers.\nSome of the best-trained horses were trained by the elven House Korianthil.\nHorses were considered sacred to many faiths of Faerûn. Warhorses were important to followers of Anhur, the Red Knight, and Tempus. Pinto and piebald horses were particularly favored by Deneir palomino horses to Waukeen. Gray-haired horses were sacred to Mask, while white ones were sacred to Milil, and chestnut-colored horses to Sune. Mystra favored donkeys, horses, and mules with blue or mismatched eyes. Intelligent horses were also native to the celestial realms of Sehanine Moonbow.\nHorses were a kind of novelty for Thymari dragonborn, as such beasts werent common in Abeir. As such, horses, specially warhorses were highly valued by Thymari, who cared for them as precious friends.\nA white horse was the symbol for the sun elf house of Evanara.\nHorses were unknown in Maztica prior to the arrival of the Golden Legion in 1361 DR. The Golden Legion used them in battle against the Mazticans, who were shocked by them and had no experience in fighting cavalry before.  \nHeavy horses\n Amphailan • Cream draft • Ishen-Charac • Kromlor • Miradans breed • Nars • Phlan cart horse • Sembian draft • Tendal\nHeavy warhorses\n Amphailan Black charger  • Arkaiun courser • Cormyrean destrier • Ostorian • Tantran Destrier • Tharurr • Tuigan courser • Ishen-Charac •\nLight horses\n Amphail Gray • Baldurian Rider • Barrowright farm horse • Chionthar • Cormyrean Strider • Darromar • Esmel long rider • Fox Trotter • Halruaan • Lhesperan • Mintan • Mucklestone • New Forest • Semphari • Shaaran zebra • Shire riding horse • Sosser • Steppe horse\nLight warhorses\n Calimite • Dambraii • Duskwood skewbald • Emberhawk • Golden Trotter • Ixinosia Longhair • Meth • Raurin • Shadiar • Thayan Black • Vilhon riding warhorse\nOther\n Amphail fancy • Carmathan Red • Nathoudi stallion • Plainsteed\nPonies\n Dales pony • Forest pony • Island pony • Orsraun pony • Mountain pony • Nether pony • Shire pony • Snowflake Mountain pony • Sunrise pony • Wild pony •\nWar ponies\n Hammer pony • Whiteshield\n Donkey (Uglib) • Gens DOr • Moon-horse • Pixie breed horse"
