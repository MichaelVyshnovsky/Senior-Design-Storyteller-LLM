Their hooves had deadly jagged edges.\nPowerful beasts, dire horses could carry loads of up to  and drag even more, up to . They had a keen  sense of smell, capable of detecting foes and use it for tracking.\nWhen confronted, dire horses tended to stomp at the enemies with their jagged hooves and with a bite right after.\nDire horses could be found solitarily and in herds of six and up to thirty beasts. Being completely wild animals, dire horses were extremely hard to domesticate or tame due to their aggressive bestial nature.\nDire horses were known to inhabit the lands of Shaar, Murgh√¥m, and Semphar. Their fierce nature and fearsome power led to several cults sprouting to worship the creatures, as well as numerous legends and folktales, and ghost stories were weaved about the dire horses of these regions.\nYeenoghu, the Demon Prince of Gnolls, was known to ride dire horses."
