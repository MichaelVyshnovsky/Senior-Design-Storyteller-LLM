They were also bound by shairs in Zakhara to serve princes and lords as architects and builders. These genies were once dao but changed over time to suit their tasks.\nThe mystical stories told of cities springing up overnight were a direct result of the power of the architect genies.\nThese genies were bald and muscular. They usually had a brand of ownership on their hand or forehead. \nArchitects could use the following spell-like abilities minor creation, vacancy, warp wood, stone shape, stone tell, and passwall. Once per month they could use a wish related to building.\nThese genies were masters at finding the weak points of any structure, making them deadly during a siege.\nArchitects would only resort to combat as a final option, preferring to let others fight instead. These genies would defend their worksite if commanded, but would rarely fight beyond its walls.\nTheir work was an architects reason for living their way to be remembered for all time.\nBuildings constructed by these genies cost four times as much were twice as strong as normal buildings and lasted for twice as long.\nThey could replicate the style of any building that they have seen and been able to study for one day.\nThese genies were slaves to the dao and resented them."
