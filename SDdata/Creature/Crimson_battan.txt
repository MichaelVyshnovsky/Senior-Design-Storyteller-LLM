Crimson battan were a type of freshwater fish found in the western tributaries of Al-Adib River in west Zakhara.
These fish were as long as a mans arm. Their scales were a deep crimson.
Native Zakharans would catch these fish by tossing small stones over the water. The fish would leap out of the water to swallow the stones, mistaking them for small birds. When enough stones had been swallowed the crimson battan would sink to the bottom of the river where it was easily harvested by fishermen.
Zakharans enjoyed fried crimson battan mixed with goose eggs, water, wheat flour, and cucumber juice. The fish was then placed in a pan of camel fat and fried until the scales flaked off at the touch of a knife.
