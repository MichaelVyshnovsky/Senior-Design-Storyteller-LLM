'''Crimson battan''' were a type of freshwater [[fish]] found in the western tributaries of [[Al-Adib River]] in [[west Zakhara]].

==Description==
These fish were as long as a man's arm. Their scales were a deep crimson.

==History==
Native [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] would catch these fish by tossing small stones over the water. The fish would leap out of the water to swallow the stones, mistaking them for small [[bird]]s. When enough stones had been swallowed the crimson battan would sink to the bottom of the river where it was easily harvested by fishermen.

Zakharans enjoyed fried crimson battan mixed with [[goose]] [[egg]]s, water, wheat flour, and [[cucumber|cucumber juice]]. The fish was then placed in a pan of [[camel]] fat and fried until the scales flaked off at the touch of a knife.
