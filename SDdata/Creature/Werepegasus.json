        "mainbody": "A werepegasus was a type of lycanthrope that could turn into a pegasus.\nWerepegasi could transform into their pegasus form from their human form. A werepegasus could be used as an aerial mount. These shapechangers were seemingly very elusive, with only one werepegasus known in the Realms. The only known pegasus was swift-winged and appeared to have the same appearance as a black pegasus.Ed Greenwood mentioned on the Candlekeep forums that werepegasi were female humans or half-elves and could shapechange into pegasi of white, blue, or dun hue. However, this contradicts sourcebook material (which mentions the black, male pegasus, Thorn). See the canon policy for more information.\n* Thorn, a Cormyrian bladesmith, and husband of Iyrytharna Dantras."
