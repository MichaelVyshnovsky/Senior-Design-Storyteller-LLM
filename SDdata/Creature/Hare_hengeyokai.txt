Hare hengeyokai () or simply hares were a hare-based subrace of the hengeyokai, a race of intelligent natural shapechanging animals able to adopt hare, human, and hybrid forms. They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.
In human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form. For a hare hengeyokai, this might be wide brown eyes, and more subtly, lightning-quick reflexes.
Compared to humans and the average hengeyokai, hares were slightly wiser but less strong, or they were more agile. They were adept in athletics skills.
Their tiny, quick animal forms were among the hardest to hit and they were the most swift-moving.
On the whole, hares were good-hearted. Like their namesake animals, they were peaceable by nature but easily surprised or frightened and they were quiet but alert for threats. They never consumed meat.
Some hares worshiped the god of the warren.
Hares, along with carps, cranes, dogs, and monkeys, were more likely to become monks than other hengeyokai.
