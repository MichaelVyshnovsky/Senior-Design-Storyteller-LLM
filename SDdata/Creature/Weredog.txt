A '''weredog''' was a [[lycanthrope]] that could transform into a large [[dog]]. They were often confused with [[werewolves]].

==Description ==
Weredogs were able to transform into dogs such as mastiffs or St. Bernards as opposed to actual [[wolves]]. Despite this, the similarities between dogs and wolves were similar enough that they could be mistaken for normal werewolves.

==Behavior==
Most often, weredogs were [[good]]-willed. They chose werewolves as their enemies, and swore to defeat them, despite being less numerous and powerful.

==Combat==
Weredogs attacked their foes with a powerful bite, which also transmitted lycanthropy.

==Society==
Weredogs were originally humanoids suffering from the lycanthropic curse, but whose strong, good-aligned personalities were able to fight back against the infection. The result was an altered form of lycanthropy that allowed the victim's personality to remain.
