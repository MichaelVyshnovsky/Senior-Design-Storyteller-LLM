'''Tarrants''' were a species of scarlet-feathered birds. They were known to inhabit the [[Pellamcopse Woods]] outside of [[Waterdeep]] and were good for food.

==History==
The [[wood elf]] [[Walaxyrvaan|Lynx]], an apprentice of [[Blackstaff Tower]], gathered a brace of tarrants in [[Uktar]] of {{Yearlink|1374}}, on a hunting party with peers when she was a new student.
