        "Description": "A typical dire hawk was {{SI|5|ft|c|long=yes}} long and had a {{SIAdj|11|ft|adj=long}} wingspan, They had bony protrusions on the top of their beaks and long trailing tail feathers.",
        "Abilities": "Dire hawks had excellent vision, just like their smaller cousins, and the [[Low-light vision|ability to see in dim light]]. They were incredibly strong, dexterous, robust and were swift fliers.",
        "Behavior": "These birds of prey hunted animals up to the size of a small [[horse]], including [[pig]]s and [[sheep]].",
        "Combat": "The exceptionally strong creatures had no trouble taking down their prey, raking with their sharp talons and biting.",
        "Ecology": "They were known to nest in large groups, close to the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].",
        "History": "Particularly large specimens of dire hawks were employed by the [[Moonsea skysentinel]]s as aerial scouts and were made part of their military tactics, such as swooping in, attacking foes, and then flying away at a quick pace.\n\nSuch dire hawks were loyal to their masters, carrying them in combat or fighting side-by-side. Some of them had close relationships with [[druid]]s, such as [[Joatra Stelmar]]."
