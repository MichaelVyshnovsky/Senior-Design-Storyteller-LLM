A tri-flower frond was an aggressive plant common to the jungles of Chult.
A fully grown tri-flower frond reached between 6 and 7 ft (1.82 to 2.13 m) tall, and sprouted three large flowers at its top one orange, one red, and one yellow.
When spotted from a distance, tri-flower fronds appeared indistinguishable from ordinary plants, and were often found in small groups.
Normally, tri-flower fronds did not initiate an attack until a creature came very close to them. However, they were also known for sneaking up on camps during the night.
Tri-flower fronds attacked by sequentially using its differently colored flowers. The first attack was a powerful anesthetic poison from the orange flower that could knock a creature unconscious for at least a minute. The second was an acidic sap ejected from the yellow flower. The third attack consisted of trapping a creature in acidic tentacles sprouting from the red flower.
These creatures were common throughout Chult and were found mainly in jungle and beach areas, as well as within ruins.
