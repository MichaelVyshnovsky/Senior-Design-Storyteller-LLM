'''Slow shadows''' were a rare type of [[undead]] not native to the [[Prime Material plane]] and possibly related to the undead known as [[shadow]]s.

==Description==
These creatures had the appearance of an undulating, inky blob with amorphous twisting to their outlines that made their size fluctuate between {{SIrange|4|6|ft}}. Despite their name, slow shadows did not move at a slow pace. They were nearly invisible in dusky or moderate light.

==Behavior==
Slow shadows had a low level of intellect.

==Abilities==
The touch of a slow shadow was very chilling and caused creatures to be ''[[slow]]ed''. They continuously impart a harmful sense of cold upon creatures they touched, draining them of their [[positive energy]]. If killed by them, a [[humanoid]] would transform into a slow shadow itself within a day, though this process was expedited in areas exposed to [[negative energy]].

Slow shadows were impervious to harm from cold and lightning. They were also unaffected by [[holy water]], ''[[charm]]'', ''[[hold]]'', ''[[command undead]]'', and ''[[turn undead]]''. If directed at them the [[spell]] ''[[haste]]'' would drive them away, though it was ineffective once they started grappling prey. They could only be harmed by weaponry with a ''[[item enchantment|+2 or greater enchantment]]''.

==Combat==
These creatures typically sneaked up on and surprised their prey. They sometimes withdrew into surrounding cracks and corners, waiting for their prey to pass by.

==Ecology==
Little was known about how these creatures interacted with each other and there had been no recorded, successful attempts to communicate with them. Those created from being killed by another slow shadow would generally stay within {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} of the site of their death.
===Diet===
These creatures preyed upon the positive energy of other creatures, including [[demihuman]]s and [[human]]s.

===Habitats===
Slow shadows were typically found in dark, shadowy places such as ruins and underground tunnel complexes. but could also be found on the [[Plane of Shadows]]{{Cite dragon/213/The Demiplane of Shadow|25}} and in the [[Domains of Dread]]. Beyond [[Toril]], this type of undead occurred on the planet [[Oerth]].

Scholars on the Prime Material plane could agree that they were not native to their plane, though were unable to ascertain whether they were native to the Negative Energy plane or the Plane of Shadows.

===Relationships===
These undead acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deities]] [[Jergal]] and [[Kiaransalee]].

Some evil-aligned [[cleric]]s seemed to be capable of enslaving and controlling slow shadows.
