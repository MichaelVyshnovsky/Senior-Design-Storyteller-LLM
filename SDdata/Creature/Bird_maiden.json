        "mainbody": "A bird maiden was a creature unique to the Land of Fate, and was related to the swanmay of Faerûn.\nLike swanmays, bird maidens were induced lycanthropes, meaning they could only access their animal forms via a token. If this token was destroyed, the bird maiden would be stuck in her humanoid or bird form. However, unlike swanmays, bird maidens could transform into different types of birds, depending on their experience. Like swanmays (which were always proven rangers or druids), only those of specific training could become a bird maiden (always kahina).\nThere were some other differences between the two shapechangers. Bird maidens were only active during the day and were more solitary than their sisters from Faerûn. Being more solitary, they were united by their faith and beliefs, but didnt form sororities as such. Bird maidens were not necessarily good, and some evil ones may have been able to shapechange into blood hawks and vultures.\nThe most proficient bird maidens could transform into giant eagles, whilst newcomers could only transform into small birds, such as parakeets.\nThe verbal components of their spells were sung, instead of spoken. Bird maidens were great herbalists.\nBird maidens got along with those who protected and respected the land, such as desert riders and mystics.\nThey fought with spears, darts, and arrays of spells, but didnt wear armor that was heavier than hide. They were unable to turn undead."
