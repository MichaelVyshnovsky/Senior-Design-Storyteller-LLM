        "Description": "Starry spheres were known for their gentle nature. These oozes radiated blue glow and within their gelatinous bodies one could see space, stars, and celestial bodies.",
        "Abilities": "These creatures were created from [[gelatinous cube]]s and shared their acidic and corrosive properties. When forced to defend themselves, starry spheres bursted out, damaging all surrounding creatures with the oozes' caustic bodies.",
        "History": "Starry spheres were created by [[Ilcanorr]] of [[Luthcheq]], sometime before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The very first starry sphere was designed to clean up after Ilcanorr's [[dye]]d [[cat]] menagerie while remaining harmless to beasts and [[humans]]. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, starry spheres were known to be sold and gifted to be used as mounts during the annual [[Simril]] celebration in [[Twilight Tor]] and occasionally brought to the city of [[Neverwinter]]. Each of these oozes came with a warning label: \"Guaranteed smoothest ride in all of [[Faer√ªn]]! Not responsible for damage to apparel, equipment, skin or internal organs.\""
