        "mainbody": "tarry spheres were placid magically-bred oozes, often used as mounts and defenders.\nStarry spheres were known for their gentle nature. These oozes radiated blue glow and within their gelatinous bodies one could see space, stars, and celestial bodies.\nThese creatures were created from gelatinous cubes and shared their acidic and corrosive properties. When forced to defend themselves, starry spheres bursted out, damaging all surrounding creatures with the oozes caustic bodies.\nStarry spheres were created by Ilcanorr of Luthcheq, sometime before the 15 century DR. The very first starry sphere was designed to clean up after Ilcanorrs dyed cat menagerie while remaining harmless to beasts and humans. By the late 15 century DR, starry spheres were known to be sold and gifted to be used as mounts during the annual Simril celebration in Twilight Tor and occasionally brought to the city of Neverwinter. Each of these oozes came with a warning label \"Guaranteed smoothest ride in all of Faer√ªn! Not responsible for damage to apparel, equipment, skin or internal organs.\""
