        "Description": "This coral on average measured {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in diameter and had colorations ranging from brown, olive, and yellow. If they were ever removed from water, the coloration of brain coral would change to that of a boney white. This part of the coral was its exoskeleton, made purely of calcium carbonate, built up over many years by an animal polyp.",
        "Personality": "These creatures possessed an exceptional degree of intelligence.",
        "Abilities": "A colony of brain coral possessed a wide arrange of psionic abilities at a ninth degree of mastery. These included the psionic attack modes ''[[ego whip]]'' and ''[[id insinuation]]'', as well as psionic defense modes ''[[mind blank (psionic)|mind blank]]'' and ''[[thought shield]]''. Colonies also possessed two or more of the following minor psionic disciplines: ''[[animal telepathy]]'', ''[[cell adjustment]]'', ''[[contact]]'', ''[[domination]]'', ''[[ESP (psionic)|ESP]]'', and ''[[invisibility (psionic)|invisibility]]''. One fourth of colonies exhibited the [[psychokinesis]] science ''[[telekinesis (psionic)|telekinesis]]''. Those who did additionally exhibited the powers ''[[ballistic attack]]'' and ''[[clairvoyance (psionic)|clairvoyance]]''.\n\nThose that possessed ''ESP'' would often attempt read the minds of visitors.\n\nAdditionally, brain coral had nematocyts (stinging cells) throughout their exoskeleton that would inject a paralyzing neurotoxin upon any creature that tried to attack them.",

            "Homelands": "Like most coral, brain was typically found within tropical waters. It could be found within warm tidal zones at depths of a {{SI|1000|ft|long=yes}} or more, usually among the growth or a coral reef or atoll. They were particularly known to be found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].<ref>",
            "Usages": "A piece of brain coral was needed as a [[material component]] for the [[spell]] ''[[awaken intelligence]]''.  A largely intact exoskeleton could also be fashioned into a sort of ''[[crystal ball]]''.<ref>"
