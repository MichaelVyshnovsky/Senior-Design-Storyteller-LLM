        "mainbody": "Panaspati were a type of memedi native to Kara-Tur.\nA panaspati resembled a malformed human, with its head between its legs. Instead of using their legs for locomotion, they used their hands and arms.\nLike all common memedi, panaspati were harmless and avoided all combat.\nIf a human saw a panaspati, they were struck with the effects similar to that of a fear spell. Panaspati breathed illusiory fire. It looked like regular fire but caused no damage nor was it able to ignite materials.\nPanaspati were solitary creatures.\nPanaspati were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of Bawa and other islands within the Island Kingdoms.\nPanaspati were summoned to harass and terrify a targeted individual for up to a day. Summoning a panaspati required two individuals and an offering of coins and food. If the offering was deemed insufficient by the panaspati, it vanished. If it accepted the offer, it asked the two individuals whom the target was."
