}}[[File:Manticorehunted.png|thumb|385x385px|A manticore being hunted.]]
A '''manticore''' was a large [[magical beast]] with the body of a [[lion]], [[dragon]]-like wings, and a somewhat [[humanoid]] head. Its long tail had a cluster of deadly spikes, which the creature could launch at its foes as weapons. It had incredibly tough claws and fangs.

==Description==
Manticores were true monsters. They were giant beasts with the bodies of lions, the wings of a dragon, the head of a man, and a tail that ended in a mass of deadly spikes. The coloration of these various body parts was similar to that of their base creature.

The mouth of a manticore was full of rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth, similar to that of a [[shark|great white shark]]. It used these teeth to feed upon any creature the manticore could catch, be it animal or human.

==Personality==
Manticores were known to be savage man-eaters and allies of evil creatures. Manticores were intelligent creatures and often worked beside other evil beings to bring strife and suffering to the world.

==Combat==
Some manticores had tail spikes that carried lethal or paralytic venom. Often, these manticores would have tails that were similar in appearance to that of a scorpion's stinger.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1267}}, manticores, along with [[harpies]] and [[peryton]]s, destroyed the city of [[Lis]] in the [[Moonsea]] region in what was known as the [[Flying Plague]].<ref>

==Ecology==
[[File:Manticore young.png|thumb|''A manticore and its young.'']]
===Diet===
Manticores were carnivorous creatures. Though they happily settled for the flesh of most any creature, they preferred the flesh of [[human]]s most of all.

===Lairs===
Manticores were typically known to make their lairs underground or within caves, particularly ones that other races would consider to be very dismal.
===Habitats===
These creatures could be found in almost any climate. However, they far preferred to live in warm habitats.

In [[Northwest Faerûn]], they could be found within the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].

In [[West Faerûn]], they could be found within the land of [[High Moor]].

==Uses==
Manticore hide was valued among some creatures for its use in furniture, such as chairs.

A unique enchanted [[cloak]], the ''[[Skin of the Manticore]]'' was created out of the beast's hide with the tail still attached. The enchantments placed on it allowed the wearer to control the venomous spiked tail of the cloak.
