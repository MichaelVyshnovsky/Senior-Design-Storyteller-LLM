'''Quaruts''' were a variety of [[inevitable]] charged with preventing disruptions to the space-time continuum.

==Description==
Quaruts were vaguely humanoid in shape, but their bodies were made of gears and pistons, with numerous small timepieces inside. The head was a continually flowing [[hourglass]]; oddly, the [[sand]] inside a quarut's head sometimes flowed up instead of down. Quaruts "wore" fine half-plate armor covered in various symbols related to time.

==Behavior==
==Combat==
==Ecology==


In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the inevitables were found in [[Dweomerheart]], the realm of Mystra.
