        "mainbody": "Gormeels (or gormeel singular and plural), sometimes specified as gormeel slaadi, were slaad manifestations of one of the most bizarre aspects of chaos the power of total randomness to create even lawful creatures. Spawned as the antithesis of their brethren, they were often found as allies of the githzerai.\nRather than frogs, gormeel slaadi naturally appeared as large, quadrupedal reptiles with gray-green to purple scales. Their front toes ended in crescent claws yet they knuckle-walked like certain apes, exclusively moving on all fours but able to stand on their hind legs for short periods of time. Rows of razor sharp teeth laid within their lizard-like heads below eyes marked with ridges of bone.\nThe lawful gormeel were often as stern and serious as the githzerai, infrequently showing signs of their origins to the point that some even played pranks, but nonetheless delighting in the destruction of their chaotic kin.\nGormeels were not only physically powerful, being able to easily trample smaller foes, but possessed several supernatural abilities as well. They were able to adapt to various elements, making themselves immune to either, water and cold, earth and acid, air and electricity, or fire, at a whim. Their heritage could be seen in their breath weapon, a  cone of raw Limbo-material as unpredictably dangerous as wild magic.\nThey had various spell-like abilities that allowed them to fight the forces of chaos, as well as deceive and befuddle their foes. At will, they could use detect chaos, detect magic, dispel chaos, protection from chaos, and see invisibility. Thrice each day a gormeel could use confusion, dimension door, and orders wrath, and only once per day freedom of movement, mislead, and word of law. Additionally, like the more magically adept slaadi, gormeels indefinitely assume a humanoid form, polymorphing into a githzerai at their leisure.\nGormeels fought intelligently, always attempting to use ranged, supernatural abilities before entering close combat and rending foes with tooth and claw, but able to adapt their strategies based on the environment, situational circumstances and the needs of their allies. They were known to serve as mounts for the githzerai, allowing them to ride them bareback or in hodawh-like baskets on their backs, as well as disguise themselves in groups of githzerai and reveal their true forms after battle had begun.\nRealizing that some Limbo natives could prove as allies, although some rejected the idea of needing help, the githzerai eventually formed a long-term alliance with the gormeel, with many githzerai communities having a handful of them dwelling within. Gormeels used their shapechanging ability to disguise themselves as githzerai, particularly when accompanying gith-attala in their fight against the githyanki, and go about unrecognized as their true, slaadi selves. Not even other slaads, who enjoyed hunting and killing their counterparts as much as the gormeels did, being able to decipher the difference.\nGormeels were a fluke breed of slaadi, mutants born by the Spawning Stone accidentally.\nGormeel lacked wings but were able to fly as a result of being naturally buoyant, maneuvering just as well in the air as they could on land. They also had a strong sense of smell, making them capable trackers.\nAfter their inception, gormeels managed to escape into Limbo without being noticed by Ygorl, the possible creator of the Spawning Stone, or Ssendam, its self-appointed protector. Their alliance with the githzerai started shortly after their arrival when an early scouting party stumbled across the orderly slaadi."
