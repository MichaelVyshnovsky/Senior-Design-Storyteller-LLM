        "mainbody": "rmeels were not only physically powerful, being able to easily trample smaller foes, but possessed several supernatural abilities as well. They were able to adapt to various elements, making themselves immune to either, water and cold, earth and acid, air and electricity, or fire, at a whim.

Thrice each day a gormeel could use ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', and ''[[order's wrath]]'', and only once per day ''[[freedom of movement]]'', ''[[mislead]]'', and ''[[word of law]]''. Additionally, like the more magically adept slaadi, gormeels indefinitely assume a humanoid form, [[polymorph]]ing into a githzerai at their leisure.",
        "Description": "Rather than frogs, gormeel slaadi naturally appeared as large, quadrupedal reptiles with gray-green to purple scales. Their front toes ended in crescent claws yet they knuckle-walked like certain [[ape]]s, exclusively moving on all fours but able to stand on their hind legs for short periods of time. Rows of razor sharp teeth laid within their lizard-like heads below eyes marked with ridges of bone.",
        "Personality": "The lawful gormeel were often as stern and serious as the githzerai, infrequently showing signs of their origins to the point that some even played pranks, but nonetheless delighting in the destruction of their chaotic kin.\n\n{{quote\n|Naturally lawful, the gormeel take particular pleasure in battling their slaadi cousins. \n|Unknown\n}}",
        "Abilities": "Gormeels were not only physically powerful, being able to easily trample smaller foes, but possessed several supernatural abilities as well.

        "Combat": "Gormeels fought intelligently, always attempting to use ranged, supernatural abilities before entering close combat and rending foes with tooth and claw, but able to adapt their strategies based on the environment, situational circumstances and the needs of their allies. They were known to serve as mounts for the githzerai, allowing them to ride them bareback or in hodawh-like baskets on their backs, as well as disguise themselves in groups of githzerai and reveal their true forms after battle had begun.",
        "Society": "Realizing that some Limbo natives could prove as allies, although some rejected the idea of needing help, the githzerai eventually formed a long-term alliance with the gormeel, with many githzerai communities having a handful of them dwelling within. Gormeels used their shapechanging ability to disguise themselves as githzerai, particularly when accompanying gith-attala in their fight against the [[githyanki]], and go about unrecognized as their true, slaadi selves. Not even other slaads, who enjoyed hunting and killing their counterparts as much as the gormeels did, being able to decipher the difference.",
        "Ecology": "Gormeels were a fluke breed of slaadi, mutants born by the [[Spawning Stone]] accidentally.\n\nGormeel lacked wings but were able to fly as a result of being naturally buoyant, maneuvering just as well in the air as they could on land. They also had a strong sense of smell, making them capable trackers.",
        "History": "After their inception, gormeels managed to escape into Limbo without being noticed by [[Ygorl]], the possible creator of the Spawning Stone, or [[Ssendam]], its self-appointed protector. Their alliance with the githzerai started shortly after their arrival when an early scouting party stumbled across the orderly slaadi."
