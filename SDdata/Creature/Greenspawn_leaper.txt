In these fights, a pair of rivals raced through the treetops until one fell. Although only beasts, greenspawn leapers were possessed of an animal cunning and some simplistic cheating would occur.
Every three years, male leapers would invade the territory of females in order to mate. The male who won the ensuing races remained with the female for several days before she chased him off. The victor would then suffer a rough homecoming, as interlopers would seize a winners territory during his absence. The female would weave a nest out of branches and then lay a clutch of eggs. The hatchling leapers would be barely cared for by the mother as they learned to fend for themselves, and eventually they would be driven away to find their own territory.
