Thunder children, also known as storm children, night rattlers, or lightning-kin were a rare and strange species of sexless humanoid creatures associated with thunderstorms.
These humanoid creatures had shiny black bodies with gaunt frames, slender limbs, and vestigial wings. They had human-like faces with pointed ears, fangs, pupil-less eyes that flashed like lightning, and tiny horns on their temples.
These creatures had a very capricious nature, very mischievous and malicious.
Thunder children possessed an innate magical ability that allowed them to cast the following spells seven times per day chain lightning (which would be shot from their eyes), fog cloud, gust of wind, and darkness, 15 radius.
Their bodies could only be harmed by weapons with a +1 or greater enchantment.
In addition, they were capable of expertly mimicking mundane sounds, such as heavy footfalls or squeaking doors. They could sense any fear within a  radius, were immune to feelings of fear and could assume a gaseous form that resembled a small, black storm cloud. They were skilled at hiding and moving silently within shadows.
Besides their use of spells and biting, thunder children would attack their victims in a psychological manner by doing things which would heighten unease regarding a storm. Such as loosening doors and windows, banging shutters, or throwing around small outdoor objects.
Thunder children were primarily active during the night or during violent thunderstorms. When acting in groups they had no proper leaders.
These creatures reproduced by flying into thunder clouds and getting struck by lightning. If they manage to survive the lightning strike, a half-strength thunder child would be born just as the thunderclap is heard. This new thunder child then matured over the course of six months.
Thunder children were known to be found in places that were especially gloomy, such as decrepit mansions, old graveyards, and dark castles along a cliffside. Any place that inspired fear in humans, demihumans, and humanoids was ideal for them. They dwelled within little caves that they hollowed out from storm clouds.
Beyond the Prime Material plane, they could occasionally be found in the realm of Ravenloft, whose shadowy gothic atmosphere felt almost like a paradise to them.
These creatures spoke Common in addition to their own language, which consisted of booms, crackles, and howls.
Due to their personalities thunder children were the enemies of many creatures in the Realms. Including air elementals, djinn, pegasi, cloud giants, and storm giants. The latter two considered them to be a nuisance, similar to how humans regarded rats, and referred to them as "thunder bats". 
Those on the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning never interacted with the native lightning quasi-elementals and shockers.
Despite the enmity often felt towards them, some thunder children were known to act as companions or servants of noble djinni.
Some rumors claimed that the blood of these creatures could be used in the brewing of a potion of gaseous form and potion of weather control.
