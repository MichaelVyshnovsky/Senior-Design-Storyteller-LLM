'''Leaf spiders''' were a species of [[poison|venomous]] [[giant spider]]s found in the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]].

==Description==
Leaf spiders were huge arachnids that reached {{SI|6'|'"|long=yes}} in length. They were hard to notice among the [[tree]]s and used their natural leaf-like camouflage to sneak on and attack prey.

==Abilities==
Venomous, like many other species of giant arachnids, leaf spiders injected poison into their opponents with each successful bite, and each bite drained the opponents' strength. The effects were not permanent, and most could restore the damage done to their muscles with enough rest.

==Ecology==
Leaf spiders could be found inhabiting the canopies of the [[iticala]] trees, feeding on the oily sap secreted high above the ground. Leaf spiders' flesh was edible and delicious, also possessing some curative properties.

Some leaf spiders were known to be trained as exotic mounts. Notably, some of the creature markets in [[Neverwinter]] sold them to adventurers with enough [[coin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
