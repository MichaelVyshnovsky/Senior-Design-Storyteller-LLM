Dragon tortoises were terrestrial creatures that, like their aquatic cousins the dragon turtles, were related to dragons.
They had massive shells, within which could form very small crevices that made suitable homes for tiny creatures.
These creatures were capable of breathing out a destructive blast of sand that spewed outward in a  cone, slashing away at the flesh of its foes.
Dragon tortoises were observed to live for other thousands of years.
