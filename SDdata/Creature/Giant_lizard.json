        "Behavior": "These creatures did not seem to keep or hoard treasure of any type. They were very quick at traversing land, and much faster than all other types of lizards. Giant lizards were good climbers, and could climb as fast as they crawled. Some of these beasts could hold their breath for up to 15 minutes, as well as climb upside down on ceilings and difficult surfaces.",
