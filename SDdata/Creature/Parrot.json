''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold parrot feathers in its Tailor's Corner section for three silver pieces per feather.\n\nParrot feathers also could be used in fletching, making good-quality [[arrow]]s."

He was unable to acquire one from the town's markets after being barred entry following a \"misunderstanding\" over something he called \"powdered beard of [[Elminster]]\".
