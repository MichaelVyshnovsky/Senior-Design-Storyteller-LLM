A '''celestial creature''' was a creature living on one of the [[Upper Planes]] that bore a resemblance to a similar creature on the [[Material Plane]]. Often mistaken for [[half-celestial]]s, these creatures were not nearly so powerful and did not share a bloodline with any of the true [[celestial]]s. 
Many celestial creatures were to celestials as animals were to [[human]]s of the Material Plane.

==Description==
Celestial creatures appeared much like their counterparts on the Prime, except that they often had visible signs of the holy realms where they dwelt, often in the form of gold, silver, or platinum coloration. while [[Deer|stags]] in the [[divine realm]] of [[Labelas Enoreth]] wore coats of white.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12}} They were generally more attractive and noble of appearance than their non-celestial cousins.

==Abilities==
Outside their majestic appearances, celestial creatures were in most ways similar to the prime creatures that they resembled, but there were a few significant differences. All celestial creatures were sentient with at least minimal intelligence. A celestial mouse would be more intelligent than any mouse native to [[Toril]].

All celestial creatures had the ability to [[Darkvision|see in the dark]] and were resistant to harm from [[acid]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], [[spell]]s, and often to attacks from mundane weapons.

An attack from a celestial creature had the supernatural power to cause more harm to creatures that were evil.

==Personality==
All celestial creatures were good like the planes on which they dwelt.

==Ecology==
There were a plethora of creatures living on all of the Upper Planes that were similar to ones from Toril yet had adapted to those good worlds. For example, celestial [[treant]]s were known to inhabit the [[World Tree]]. Celestial animals roamed [[Bytopia]] in great numbers; in [[Garl Glittergold]]'s [[Golden Hills]], they were golden-furred and golden-plumed. [[Elysium]], too, had great numbers of celestial animals with golden skin and silver eyes. [[Arborea]] had many celestial creatures. Within it, the realm of [[Arvandor]] was full of celestial [[elves]]. Celestial [[eagle]]s flew the skies of [[Aerdrie Faenya]]'s [[Divine realm|realm]] of [[Aerie (realm)|Aerie]]. Celestial [[dolphin]]s swam [[Deep Sashelas]]' [[Sparkling Sea]], and a host of celestial animals inhabited the [[Fennimar|woods]] of [[Fenmarel Mestarine]]. Likewise, celestial [[dragon]]s were native to the [[Dragon Eyrie]],

==History==
Most celestial creatures were natural inhabitants of their planes and always had been; however, in some cases, a celestial creature had once existent in a past life on the Material Plane. This was especially true in the [[House of Nature]], where that plane's [[humanoid]] [[petitioner]]s slowly took on animalistic traits until they at last fully morphed into celestial animals. Some sages claimed that the same was true for the celestial animals living in the [[Beastlands]].

==Notable Celestial Creatures==
Over the centuries, both [[Divine magic|divine]] and [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spellcasters had learned the power to [[Summon monster|summon]] many varieties of celestial creatures from their home planes for temporary aid. Common among these were celestial [[badger]]s, [[bear]]s, [[bison]], [[dog]]s, dolphins, eagles and [[giant eagle]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[giant bee]]s, giant [[beetle]]s, [[griffon]]s and [[hippogriff]]s, [[lion]]s, [[monkey]]s, [[owl]]s and [[giant owl]]s, [[roc]]s, [[sea cat]]s, [[triceratops]], and [[whale]]s. In the case of divine magic, these creatures were most often servants of the deific power worshiped by the summoning [[cleric]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}}

The spell ''[[vipergout]]'' summoned celestial [[viper]]s. The [[elven high magic]] spell ''[[celestial army]]'' could be used to summon a single celestial [[lammasu]]. The ''[[pegasus helm of Kloeth Ironstar]]'' was a magical helmet that could summon a celestial [[pegasus]].

The [[Keepers]] were a group of celestial [[halfling]]s in service to [[Arvoreen]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10}}

[[Celestial charger]]s were celestial [[unicorn]]s who inhabited [[Mielikki]]'s [[Grove of the Unicorns]].
