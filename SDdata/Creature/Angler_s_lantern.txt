The anglers lantern was a species of jellyfish found in the Sea of Moving Ice.
These creatures were named for their highly bioluminescent organs, which made it easier to spot them during the night.
Anglers lanterns were believed to be active at any hour of the day, but it was hard to confirm this, owing to the difficulty of spotting them during daylight hours.
