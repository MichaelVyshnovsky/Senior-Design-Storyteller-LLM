        "mainbody": "Tuen-rin were a powerful species of outer-planar creature related to ki-rin.\nTuen-rin were accurately described as resembling ki-rin they had a horse-like body some  long, with fine golden scales all over except for a deep, dark golden mane and tail. The scales scintillated with \"impossible\" shades of color. The horn and hooves were a pinkish-ivory color, while the eyes were a deep, liquid violet. Writings about tuen-rin often described their faces as \"wise and beautiful\" and many planar travellers claimed that was no sight more beautiful than a tuen-rin galloping across the sky at sunset.\nTuen-rin were lawful creatures motivated only by the pursuit of good. They were peaceful, but not pacifist, for they were also fearless foes of evil. However, they were also distant and removed from the affairs of the Prime Material plane.\nTuen-rin were far more powerful than the ki-rin- they were on par with greater baatezu or true tanarri, and were accounted amongst the most gifted creatures in the planes. They innately flew with perfect manuverability, could travel into the Ethereal and Astral planes as they wished, and could innately cast gaseous form, invisibility, summon weather, and call lightning all at will. Moreover, no creature of elemental air would attack a tuen-rin unless compelled to do so by a being of equal or greater power.\nTuen-rin spoke all languages, but they could also communicate by way of telepathy and empathy the former of which allowed them to know alignment and detect lie unerringly.\nOne of their more potent abilities was that, once per day, they could unleash an aura of divine awe which could induce any nondivine creatures within sight to stand motionless for a length of time inversely proportionate to their mental fortitude. If the tuen-rin so chose, it could follow up the awe with a form of suggestion or emotion that effected all awed creatures. In this way, tuen-rin had been known to inspire entire armies to courage or put legions of evil beings to flight.\nTuen-rin were also spellcasters of equal skill and power to master wizards. Each day a tuen-rin could use 15 first-tier spells, 14 second-tier spells, 13 third-tier spells, and so on up to being able to use 7 ninth-tier spells each day. They favored illusion and enchantment spells, but would use more powerful and dangerous spells against deadlier enemies.\nAkin to the ki-rin, once per day a tuen-rin could create nutritous food and water for as many as 100 people,  of wood, and  of stone or metal items. These materials were permanent.\nTuen-rin had a trio of \"divine\" abilities with one, a tuen-rin could cause any crops within a  area to grow at maximum speed and yield maximum harvest they typically used this ability to help farmers in trouble or to reward those who had lived with integrity. With another, they could cure all disease within a  area and halt the spread of it there for a full year. And with the third, they could make a direct telepathic attack against all evil creatures within a  area, driving them away and preventing them from entering the area for a month though this ability required the aid of a deity.\nTuen-rin enjoyed engaging in direct physical combat with evil beings, often choosing to use their natural weaponry over their spells. Then again, their horn and hooves were as potent as a powerfully enchanted weapon of material making. Additionally, tuen-rin were highly intelligent and knew when to retreat or not follow a foe. Tuen-rin did not attack awed enemies unless killing the enemy was an evil that had to be killed to be stopped.\nTuen-rin were said by some Material cultures to be the ultimate embodiment of good planars, of course, said that any cutter with half a brain knew that there were greater celestials.\nThey were native to the plane of Arcadia, where they lived amongst the clouds and could go centuries setting foot on the ground. But they were, perhaps, better known to travelling the Outer Planes to fight evil they also helped good-hearted folk wherever they were found.\nAccording to some, there were no male tuen-rin, only females, while according to others, the male tuen-rin was the ki-rin. Yet others claimed that there was only a limited number of tuen-rin, a couple dozen or so, and that each one lost was irreplaceable. The tuen-rin themselves were silent on the topic.\nUnfortunately, the great power, separation from the goings-ons of others, and airy home of the tuen-rin had planted a seed of arrogance and superiority in the hearts of many of them. Some planar sages claimed that the tuen-rin might fall if they continued to distance themselves.\nTuen-rin were known to act on behalf of the Pharaonic deities Hathor, Isis, Nephthys, and Osiris the elven deities Aerdrie Faenya, Corellon, Labelas Enoreth, and Sehanine Moonbow the dwarven deity Clangeddin Silverbeard and the halfling deities Cyrrollalee and Yondalla."
