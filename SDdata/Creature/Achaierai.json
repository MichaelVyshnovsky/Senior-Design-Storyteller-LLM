        "Description": "Achaierais were {{SIAdj|15|ft|adj=tall}}, flightless birds that resembled plump [[quail]]s and weighed about {{SI|750|lb|k}}. They were quadrupeds with stilt-like legs, {{SIrange|8|9|ft}} long, that emerged from their underside, ending in wicked talons. Withered, rudimentary wings rested either side of the spherical, pony-sized heads that made up their main body.\n\nTheir crests were almost always bright red but could be of any color, as their soft feathers, varied from dim teal to shadowed gold to burnt russet in their muted hue. Their legs were a metallic blue-gray, and along with their claws and beak, shone like burnished metal.",

        "Combat": "[[File:Achaieraiassault.jpg|thumb|220x220px|An Achaierai assaulting humans.]]\nAlthough the beaks of achaierais were just as dangerous as their claws, their great height prevented them from pecking at [[human]]-sized opponents while also stopping such foes from harming their main bodies in return. If an opponent was over 10 feet tall or elevated to that height, they could then strike them with their beaks. They were skilled combatants, targeting whichever enemy appeared the most dangerous with two of their claws and attacking as a group. Because of their size, only two achaeirai could engage a human-sized opponent at the same time, but their long strides and mobility allowed them to attack and retreat before their enemy could counterattack. If one member's leg was crippled they would attempt to escape while the rest of the flock fought and they saved their black cloud until three legs were injured, using it as a smokescreen. Their last resort was to unleash the [[rust dragon]]s living in their lair as diversions so that the surviving flock could escape.",
        "Society": "Achaierai were social creatures that formed flocks of 2-8 members, but nonetheless lacked any true society. Weak flock members were cannibalized in times of scarcity and 90% of the time they possessed no leader. Achaierai flock leaders were simply larger, more powerful members of their kind. Flock gatherings and interactions were common, especially during their random migrations.\n\nWhen an achaierai flock decided to migrate to another cube in [[Avalas]], they attached harnesses to their rust dragons and flew to their destination. Rust dragons displayed a strange affection towards achaierai mimicking that between [[dog]]s and humans and when raised by them, learned to tolerate the presence of other members of their kind. Achaierai occasionally gathered and tended to the cocoons of rust dragons and the resulting hatchling would create tunnels in Acheron's black cubes in which the achaierai made their lairs.\n\nOn the [[Material Plane]], achaierai and underground races like the [[drow]] or [[svirfneblin]] mutually exterminated one another. The achaierai devoured the populations and livestock of underground villages, rightfully invoking fear and disgust in the natives.",
        "Ecology": "Although occasionally found in Material Plane caverns, achaierai were most commonly found on Avalas or [[Thuldanin]], only leaving their underground lairs under the cover of night. Their nesting areas were made in locations with several small chambers and disturbing such sites was to invoke their wrath. They mated for life even when their partners were infertile and threatening their mates prompted the same reaction as doing so to their nesting sites. Mated couples produced a clutch of two eggs each year but were incapable of reproducing on the Material Plane. Clutchmates had a high likelihood of attacking and killing one another, but upon reaching maturity at three years old they could speak normally speak all bird languages, as well as [[Planespeak]]. Their actual lifespans were disputed with some sources claiming they lived for about 30 years while others purported that they were extremely long-lived.\n\nAchaierai feasted on flesh regardless of whether it was fresh, fetid, scavenged, hunted or even a member of their own kind. Their massive size required them to eat a large amount of meat each day and their diets were supplemented with enough iron to make their legs metallic.",
