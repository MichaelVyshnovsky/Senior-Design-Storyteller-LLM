Rock crabs were a variety of crab endemic to the River Esmur, in Laerakond during the century between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering. These crustaceans were also a staple of dwarven cuisine.
During that time period, because of their habitats, rock crabs were coveted in many other regions of the continent, and the merchants and fishers of Tarsith made lots of money exporting the crabs to other regions.
Human-hand-sized rock crabs could be found inhabiting the region of Cape Velen on the Dragons Head Peninsula. 
Rock crabs were prepared for eating by rolling their flesh into balls and later baking them.
The Blackthorns Brew inn in Velen offered the dish called Sixroots Salad that consisted of several types of root vegetables fried in butter served with tender boiled rock crabs.
