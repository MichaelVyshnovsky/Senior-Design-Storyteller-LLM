'''Rock crabs''' were a variety of [[crab]] endemic to the [[River Esmur]], in [[Laerakond]] during the century between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]]. These crustaceans were also a staple of [[dwarf|dwarven]] cuisine.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-03 - Dwarven Cuisine}}

==Description==
During that time period, because of their habitats, rock crabs were coveted in many other regions of the continent, and the merchants and fishers of [[Tarsith]] made lots of money exporting the crabs to other regions.

[[Human]]-hand-sized rock crabs could be found inhabiting the region of [[Cape Velen]] on the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]]. 

==Usages==
Rock crabs were prepared for eating by rolling their flesh into balls and later baking them.

The [[Blackthorn's Brew]] inn in [[Velen]] offered the dish called [[Sixroots Salad]] that consisted of several types of root vegetables fried in [[butter]] served with tender boiled rock crabs.
