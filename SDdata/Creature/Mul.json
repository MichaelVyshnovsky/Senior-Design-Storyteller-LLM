        "mainbody": "'''Muls''' were a sterile [[demihuman]] race of [[w:c:darksun:human|human]]â€“[[Athasian dwarf|dwarf]] hybrids native to the desert world of [[Athas]].",
        "Etymology": "The word \"mul\" was derived from an Athasian Dwarven term, '''mulzhennedar''', which translated into [[Common]] as \"strength.\" Pronunciation of \"Mul\" varied throughout the [[w:c:darksun:Tyr Region|Tyr region]], with some common pronunciations including ''mool'', ''mull'', or derogatorily ''mule''.",
        "Description": "The mul body inherited its height from its human parent, with the average adult standing around {{SIrange|5'8\"|7'0\"|ft-in}} tall and weighing around {{SIrange|250|300|lb|long=yes}}, with particularly large and strong muls exhibiting the latter weight. Due to a high metabolism, muls had wide, lean, muscular bodies with very little in the way of body fat. They often had broad shoulders, thick arms, and powerful thighs. Female muls, though not as heavily muscled as males, were equally tall and athletic in build. \n\nTheir overall appearance was more similar to that of a human than a dwarf, though taller. They were distinguished from Athasian humans by their small pointed ears that ended in subtle tips, stern facial features that reflected their dwarven heritage, prominent brow ridges, and a complete lack of body hair regardless of [[Gender and sex|sex]]. Due to this last factor, the majority of muls were bald, with a small few able to grow top-knots of dark hair.\n[[File:WildMul-2e.png|thumb|270px|''A menacing escaped slave mul sporting a top-knot.'']]\nMuls had skin that was as tough as an [[w:c:darksun:Gith, Athasian|Athasian gith's]] hide and a light skin tone, sometimes copperish in coloration or deeply bronzed, with eyes that ranged from green-gold to honey-gold in coloration. They were often fond of [[tattoo]]s, favoring simple geometric patterns reminiscent of dwarven motifs. Most muls who lived at any point as slaves had their heads and bodies decorated in tattoos that served to denote their occupation, who owned them, and their training, or if they were a gladiator it served to denote how many victories they'd had in arenas.",
        "Personality": "Due to the dreadful conditions in which they typically were born and raised on Athas, muls often exhibited gruff personalities, pragmatism, and little remorse or sympathy for others. Many had their daily thoughts consumed by malice and hatred over their lot in life, becoming violent misanthropes that leaned towards [[evil]]. However, some, having found ways to work the slave pits in their favor and earn the favor of other slaves, didn't view their lives so harshly.\n\nMuls who managed to escape bondage often handled social situations better, but most remained wary of strangers, often finding it difficult to open themselves up to trusting or befriending others. They might be paranoid that any non-mul they encountered could be a [[bounty hunter]] seeking to return them to slavery. And though other muls were trusted more than other races, they were still treated with suspicion.",
        "Abilities": "Due to their mixed parentage, muls were a hardy, very strong, and adaptable people. Their incredible endurance inherited from dwarves allowed them to work harder than most other demihumans and for greater periods of time.\n\nLike many creatures on Athas, muls were also naturally [[psionic]]. About three-fourths of all muls were wild talents, only exhibiting  one or two psionic abilities, while one-fourth possessed a wide array of psionic talents under the [[discipline]]s [[psychokinesis]] or [[telepathy]]. Common psionic powers possessed by muls included ''[[conceal thoughts]]'', ''[[contact]]'', ''[[control body]]'', ''[[inflict pain]]'', ''[[Invisibility (psionic)|invisibility]]'', ''[[levitation (psionic)|levitation]]'', ''[[Mind blank (psionic)|mind blank]]'', ''[[mind thrust]]'', ''[[telekinesis (psionic)|telekinesis]]'', and ''[[thought shield]]''.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Mul rioter.jpg|thumb|270px|''An irate [[manacles|manacled]] mul slave strikes back at its captors with a large stone.'']]\nThose living outside of bondage on Athas typically wore [[leather armor]] and carried a small- or medium-sized shield, both likely taken with them from an arena if they had escaped from that life, and fought with a [[long sword]]. Other commonly used weapons included [[flail]]s, [[mace]]s, [[polearm]]s, [[warhammer]]s, [[greatclub]]s, and most rarely [[short sword]]s. While these weapons were typically made of bone or stone, it was not unlikely to encounter muls carrying [[obsidian]] or even metal weaponry.\n\nMuls typically favored being [[w:c:darksun:gladiator|gladiators]], [[fighter]]s, dedicated psionicists, [[thieves]], or even [[cleric]]s or [[druid]]s.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Like other demihumans, muls were an omnivorous race. However, wild mul clans were often forced into a largely carnivorous diet because of the scarcity of plant life in the areas where they tended to settle, occasionally even resorting to attacking and eating other humanoids.",
            "Languages": "Though muls did not have a distinct language of their own, they typically knew Athasian common, being taught it in the slave pits, and any other language they knew was likely learned from other captured slaves. The other language commonly known by muls was Athasian dwarven.",
            "Relationships": "Wild muls typically had animosity with Athasian thri-kreen, as thri-kreen tribes sometimes hunted them down."
        },
        "History": "Muls had existed on Athas as far back as humans and dwarves were in contact, but did not achieve significant enough numbers to be considered a distinct race until the Sorcerer Kings began breeding them in large numbers as a slave force. The Sorcerer Kings had hoped they would make for the perfect race of soldiers, but they quickly abandoned the idea of mul armies after it became apparent they were hard to control and quite independent in nature.\n\nIn The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[gate]]'' to the faraway world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|9}} Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|13}}\n\nAfter two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large [[erdlu]] [[egg]]s (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two ''[[potion fruit|apples of healing]]''. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach the [[Ringing Forest]], which was their way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|14}}\n\nWhile on the way to this forest the adventurers came across the [[Lost Oasis]], a village built around an oasis by a clan of around fifty muls and led by a famous ex-gladiator mul, [[Miralte the Wolf]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|18-19}} The Malatran heroes, being unfamiliar with muls, mistook them as [[Nubari]] with broad builds.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|11}}"
