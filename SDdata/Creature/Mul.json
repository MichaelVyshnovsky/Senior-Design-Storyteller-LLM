        "mainbody": "Muls were a sterile demihuman race of humanâ€“dwarf hybrids native to the desert world of Athas.\nThe word \"mul\" was derived from an Athasian Dwarven term, mulzhennedar, which translated into Common as \"strength.\" Pronunciation of \"Mul\" varied throughout the Tyr region, with some common pronunciations including mool, mull, or derogatorily mule.\nThe mul body inherited its height from its human parent, with the average adult standing around  tall and weighing around , with particularly large and strong muls exhibiting the latter weight. Due to a high metabolism, muls had wide, lean, muscular bodies with very little in the way of body fat. They often had broad shoulders, thick arms, and powerful thighs. Female muls, though not as heavily muscled as males, were equally tall and athletic in build. \nTheir overall appearance was more similar to that of a human than a dwarf, though taller. They were distinguished from Athasian humans by their small pointed ears that ended in subtle tips, stern facial features that reflected their dwarven heritage, prominent brow ridges, and a complete lack of body hair regardless of sex. Due to this last factor, the majority of muls were bald, with a small few able to grow top-knots of dark hair.\nthumb|270px|A menacing escaped slave mul sporting a top-knot.\nMuls had skin that was as tough as an Athasian giths hide and a light skin tone, sometimes copperish in coloration or deeply bronzed, with eyes that ranged from green-gold to honey-gold in coloration. They were often fond of tattoos, favoring simple geometric patterns reminiscent of dwarven motifs. Most muls who lived at any point as slaves had their heads and bodies decorated in tattoos that served to denote their occupation, who owned them, and their training, or if they were a gladiator it served to denote how many victories theyd had in arenas.\nDue to the dreadful conditions in which they typically were born and raised on Athas, muls often exhibited gruff personalities, pragmatism, and little remorse or sympathy for others. Many had their daily thoughts consumed by malice and hatred over their lot in life, becoming violent misanthropes that leaned towards evil. However, some, having found ways to work the slave pits in their favor and earn the favor of other slaves, didnt view their lives so harshly.\nMuls who managed to escape bondage often handled social situations better, but most remained wary of strangers, often finding it difficult to open themselves up to trusting or befriending others. They might be paranoid that any non-mul they encountered could be a bounty hunter seeking to return them to slavery. And though other muls were trusted more than other races, they were still treated with suspicion.\nDue to their mixed parentage, muls were a hardy, very strong, and adaptable people. Their incredible endurance inherited from dwarves allowed them to work harder than most other demihumans and for greater periods of time.\nLike many creatures on Athas, muls were also naturally psionic. About three-fourths of all muls were wild talents, only exhibiting  one or two psionic abilities, while one-fourth possessed a wide array of psionic talents under the disciplines psychokinesis or telepathy. Common psionic powers possessed by muls included conceal thoughts, contact, control body, inflict pain, invisibility, levitation, mind blank, mind thrust, telekinesis, and thought shield.\nthumb|270px|An irate manacled mul slave strikes back at its captors with a large stone.\nThose living outside of bondage on Athas typically wore leather armor and carried a small- or medium-sized shield, both likely taken with them from an arena if they had escaped from that life, and fought with a long sword. Other commonly used weapons included flails, maces, polearms, warhammers, greatclubs, and most rarely short swords. While these weapons were typically made of bone or stone, it was not unlikely to encounter muls carrying obsidian or even metal weaponry.\nMuls typically favored being gladiators, fighters, dedicated psionicists, thieves, or even clerics or druids.\nMuls had no distinct, unified culture or racial identity of their own, nor their own language.\nThe majority of muls in Athasian society were slaves to tribes, to the nobility of city-states, or to merchant houses, having been born into the life in their slave pits. As slaves they worked as either gladiators in arenas or as laborers, the latter typically taking the form of combat training, construction, mining, and quarrying. They were highly valued for both professions because of their raw strength and great endurance, to the point that slavers often pampered those who performed well in arenas and jealously guarded them, even going so far as to pay bounty hunters highly for the retrieval of a runaway.\nSome muls on Athas did live free lives, having either won or purchased their freedom, escaped bondage or even more rarely been born free, such as in dwarven villages. Free muls generally did not gather together into communities or villages of their own, but sometimes formed small clans or tribes, the former typically consisting of two to seven individuals who likely escaped from bondage together. Such wild clans tended to settle in the rocky barren areas of Athas, near where the deserts and plains of the Tablelands met.\nFree muls often found ready employment as mercenaries, guards of a noble family, or the sentries of a merchant house. But if a mul slave had run away from their captors, they rarely ever entered city-states, lest they be captured and face a public execution.\nLike other demihumans, muls were an omnivorous race. However, wild mul clans were often forced into a largely carnivorous diet because of the scarcity of plant life in the areas where they tended to settle, occasionally even resorting to attacking and eating other humanoids.\nThough muls did not have a distinct language of their own, they typically knew Athasian common, being taught it in the slave pits, and any other language they knew was likely learned from other captured slaves. The other language commonly known by muls was Athasian dwarven.\nWild muls typically had animosity with Athasian thri-kreen, as thri-kreen tribes sometimes hunted them down.\nMuls had existed on Athas as far back as humans and dwarves were in contact, but did not achieve significant enough numbers to be considered a distinct race until the Sorcerer Kings began breeding them in large numbers as a slave force. The Sorcerer Kings had hoped they would make for the perfect race of soldiers, but they quickly abandoned the idea of mul armies after it became apparent they were hard to control and quite independent in nature.\nIn The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14 century DR, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the Malatran Plateau through an elemental gate to the faraway world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by Athasian elf slavers. Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry sink worm. They seized the opportunity and freed Kacha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.\nAfter two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Kacha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the Windrunners, and their leader, Kirikku. Kacha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Kirikku gifted the aliens four large erdlu eggs (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two apples of healing. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach the Ringing Forest, which was their way back to Toril.\nWhile on the way to this forest the adventurers came across the Lost Oasis, a village built around an oasis by a clan of around fifty muls and led by a famous ex-gladiator mul, Miralte the Wolf. The Malatran heroes, being unfamiliar with muls, mistook them as Nubari with broad builds."
