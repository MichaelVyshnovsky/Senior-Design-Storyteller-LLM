        "mainbody": "lux slaads were an uncommon variety of slaadi that emerged in the Elemental Chaos following the Spellplague. They were generally smaller and weaker than other varieties of slaadi, garnering them little respect among their peers.\nA flux slaad completely lacked any sense of self-awareness or self-preservation. Their actions were blindly motivated by a desire to cause chaos and carnage, often beset by unpredictable and violent rages.\nUnlike other slaadi, a flux slaad lacked the ability to reproduce. They could teleport short distances and could see in areas of low light. Their monikor of \"flux\" derived from their resistances and vulnerabilites towards various elements and elemental energies always being in a state of flux, such as cold, fire, lighting, psionic energy, necrotic energy, and sound. Whenever they were injured by one of these, they would become resistant to it and something else would in-turn becoming its vulnerability.\nThese slaadi solely fought with the use of their claws.\nA flux slaad occasionally slipped by accident through portals, commonly ending up near gatherings of bullywugs. They would often make themselves revered rulers over the bullywugs and showed great restraint in harming their subjects.\nFlux slaads spoke both Common and Primordial."
