        "Description": "Since ''Duhlark's animerge'' allowed the caster to fuse two different creatures into one new creature that possessed physical traits of both, the description of a duhlarkin varied greatly.",
        "Combat": "The type of physical attacks that a duhlarkin was capable of depended on the physical attributes it acquired from its \"parent\" creatures.",
        "Society": "The general behavior of a duhlarkin was similar to that of the dominant creature used during its creation. A duhlarkin was capable of reproducing by mating with either of the creatures it was related to. The offspring from these unions were stillborn a quarter of the time, resulted in a duhlarkin a quarter of the time, and resulted in the pure creature half of the time. A pair of mating duhlarkins would result in a stillborn half of the time and duhlarkin half of the time."
