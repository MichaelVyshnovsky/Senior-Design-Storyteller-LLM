        "mainbody": "'''Mystran talisman servant''' were a type of ancient [[Netherese]] [[construct]]s, named after the goddess of magic [[Mystra]].",
        "Description": "Mystran was one of the [[talisman servant]]s developed by the Netherese. Mystran was the most polished and refined in appearance among the three varieties of these constructs. The talisman servants were chiseled out of [[stone]] and fortified with metal, usually – [[steel]], [[mithril]], or [[silver]]. They were created to resemble a muscular {{SIrange|7|9|ft.}} tall [[humanoid]] with an animal's head. These constructs were often dressed in the traditional garb of the ranking members of the [[Church of Mystra]], ancient military uniforms. They carried a silver talisman shaped like an eight-pointed star or a shield. Sometimes such amulets were created in the forms of earrings or bracelets. All of them were engraved with interlocking Mystran ''[[holy symbol]]s'' and symbols of gods who offered protection, such as [[Helm]], [[Berronar Truesilver]], or [[Yondalla]]. Unlike other talisman servants, Mystran were intelligent.",
        "Abilities": "Apart from their intellect, these talisman servants had an extremely keen hearing and possessed magic gaze. Each individual Mystran construct was given one of two possible powers. The first was the ability to''[[paralyze]]'', similarly to the effects of ''[[hold]]'' spells. The gaze kept targets unmoving as long as Mystran kept its eyes on the opponent. The second magical gaze allowed the golem's master to see through its eyes and sometimes suffered from vertigo caused by it. The effects were similar to a powerful version of the ''[[arcane eye]]'' spell.\n\nMystran talisman servants were immune to ''[[illusion]]'' magics, could see through ''[[invisibility]]'', were unaffected by ''[[fear]]'', and other spells that affected ones mind. Their magical construction made Mystrans only vulnerable to weapons with enchantments of at least ''+2'' potency.",
        "Behavior": "These construct servants were reliable and never left their posts and were considered some of the most intelligent man-made [[golem]]-like creatures out there, intelligent enough to understand and follow complex orders, use mechanisms, set and activate traps, and were capable strategists. They also had an uncannily sharp memory, seeming never forgot faces of wrongdoers nor instructions. Mystran talisman servant guarded territory within {{SI|240'|'\"|long=yes}} from their mark and never strayed further than that, even when pursuing opponents. Furthermore, these constructs were not capable of breaking into homes or holy ground.\n\nIf a thief stole the golem master's talisman or Mystran's ward, the construct was free to track the perpetrator and reclaim the stolen item, unbound from any previous behavioral limitations. These chases could last for decades as talismans servants did not age nor abandon their tasks.",
        "Combat": "Mystran talisman servant wielded [[enchanted]] [[polearm]]s in battle, usually ensorcelled to be effective against thieves. When disarmed, they used their powerful animal jaws to bite and crush their targets.",
        "Ecology": "Mystran talisman servants did not eat, sleep, nor needed to breathe like other constructs. They left no mark on the natural order of things, and the only thing of value one could scavenge from a destroyed talisman servant were its polearm and its [[gem]] eyes that were valued at 1,000 [[gold]] [[coin]]s each.",
        "History": "Talisman servants first were developed ''circa'' [[-1846 DR]] by a group of artificers known as [[Mystra's Anvil]]. These creations were distinct enough from regular golems. They proved to be smarter and deadlier. However, the fact that a ward and a talisman could not remain at a distance greater than a mile proved to be a major hindrance. While the fact that talisman servants were crafted out of virtually anything was a certain benefit.{{Cite dragon/242/The Dragon's Bestiary: Talisman Servants|82}}\n\nAfter the Fall of Nethril in [[-290 DR]], many of the wizards hid their talisman servants or had them destroyed. Yet [[bard]]s knew songs about \"rogue automatons,\" and wizards sought tomes with the secrets of their creation.\n\nLike other construct creatures, mystran talisman servants were created and animated by powerful [[priest]]s or [[wizard]]s. They were crafted for one purpose – the protection of an individual, place, or item. They were often used as fortress guards or temple sentries by the Netherese arcanists. Post-[[Karsus's Folly]], Mystran talisman servants were used by the inhabitants of the [[North Faerûn]] to guard sanctums of temples dedicated to [[Azuth]], [[Helm]], or Mystra. The constructs were rare and most often were exported out of [[Nimbral]], [[Halruua]], and [[Thay]]."
