        "mainbody": "Mystran talisman servant were a type of ancient Netherese constructs, named after the goddess of magic Mystra.\nMystran was one of the talisman servants developed by the Netherese. Mystran was the most polished and refined in appearance among the three varieties of these constructs. The talisman servants were chiseled out of stone and fortified with metal, usually – steel, mithril, or silver. They were created to resemble a muscular  tall humanoid with an animals head. These constructs were often dressed in the traditional garb of the ranking members of the Church of Mystra, ancient military uniforms. They carried a silver talisman shaped like an eight-pointed star or a shield. Sometimes such amulets were created in the forms of earrings or bracelets. All of them were engraved with interlocking Mystran holy symbols and symbols of gods who offered protection, such as Helm, Berronar Truesilver, or Yondalla. Unlike other talisman servants, Mystran were intelligent.\nApart from their intellect, these talisman servants had an extremely keen hearing and possessed magic gaze. Each individual Mystran construct was given one of two possible powers. The first was the ability toparalyze, similarly to the effects of hold spells. The gaze kept targets unmoving as long as Mystran kept its eyes on the opponent. The second magical gaze allowed the golems master to see through its eyes and sometimes suffered from vertigo caused by it. The effects were similar to a powerful version of the arcane eye spell.\nMystran talisman servants were immune to illusion magics, could see through invisibility, were unaffected by fear, and other spells that affected ones mind. Their magical construction made Mystrans only vulnerable to weapons with enchantments of at least +2 potency.\nThese construct servants were reliable and never left their posts and were considered some of the most intelligent man-made golem-like creatures out there, intelligent enough to understand and follow complex orders, use mechanisms, set and activate traps, and were capable strategists. They also had an uncannily sharp memory, seeming never forgot faces of wrongdoers nor instructions. Mystran talisman servant guarded territory within  from their mark and never strayed further than that, even when pursuing opponents. Furthermore, these constructs were not capable of breaking into homes or holy ground.\nIf a thief stole the golem masters talisman or Mystrans ward, the construct was free to track the perpetrator and reclaim the stolen item, unbound from any previous behavioral limitations. These chases could last for decades as talismans servants did not age nor abandon their tasks.\nMystran talisman servant wielded enchanted polearms in battle, usually ensorcelled to be effective against thieves. When disarmed, they used their powerful animal jaws to bite and crush their targets.\nMystran talisman servants did not eat, sleep, nor needed to breathe like other constructs. They left no mark on the natural order of things, and the only thing of value one could scavenge from a destroyed talisman servant were its polearm and its gem eyes that were valued at 1,000 gold coins each.\nTalisman servants first were developed circa -1846 DR by a group of artificers known as Mystras Anvil. These creations were distinct enough from regular golems. They proved to be smarter and deadlier. However, the fact that a ward and a talisman could not remain at a distance greater than a mile proved to be a major hindrance. While the fact that talisman servants were crafted out of virtually anything was a certain benefit.\nAfter the Fall of Nethril in -290 DR, many of the wizards hid their talisman servants or had them destroyed. Yet bards knew songs about \"rogue automatons,\" and wizards sought tomes with the secrets of their creation.\nLike other construct creatures, mystran talisman servants were created and animated by powerful priests or wizards. They were crafted for one purpose – the protection of an individual, place, or item. They were often used as fortress guards or temple sentries by the Netherese arcanists. Post-Karsuss Folly, Mystran talisman servants were used by the inhabitants of the North Faerûn to guard sanctums of temples dedicated to Azuth, Helm, or Mystra. The constructs were rare and most often were exported out of Nimbral, Halruua, and Thay."
