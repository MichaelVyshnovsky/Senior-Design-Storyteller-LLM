A '''swanmay''' was a [[humanoid]] that could transform into a [[swan]],

==Description==
Swanmays were intelligent [[ranger]]s (or [[druid]]s) that could take the form of swans, mostly for mobility purposes. In humanoid form, they resembled beautiful women, often wearing [[light armor]] or attendant garb

==Behavior==
These induced lycanthropes kept themselves to their own kind, never divulging about their true nature. They disliked noisy, ferocious, and [[evil]] beings.

==Combat==
In swan form, the creature took reduced damage except against cold iron and had higher resistance to [[magic]]al [[spell]]s. In this form, they attacked with flying leaps, buffeting their wings, and biting. In human form, they fought in light [[armor]], and attacked with [[sword]]s and [[dagger]]s at close range, and [[bow]]s at long range.

==Society==
Such creatures were part of a secret order that wished to protect the wilderness from evil. Only [[good]]-willed females were permitted to join the order, and must have had history in protecting the wild. The order had additional requirements for recruits, such as being able to speak [[Sylvan]] and the ability to speak with animals. As well as meeting these requirements, an initiate must have performed a great deed for another swanmay before being accepted into the order. When they were officially a part of the order, they accepted a feathered token that allowed them to change forms. The token could also be a signet [[ring]] or a feathered garment.
===Homelands===
Swanmays rarely traveled outside a specific area, as they preferred living in sororities near rivers, lakes, and forests teeming with wildlife. There were legends of the Seven Swanmays who lived in the [[King's Forest]], granting good fortune to those who revered and protected life and nature of the woods, and bringing misfortune on those who endangered the forest with fires and poaches.

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], swanmays could be found in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].<ref>

===Relationships===
Swanmays got on well with like-minded forest dwellers, such as [[dryad]]s and and [[wood elves]].

==History==
[[File:Swanmay 2e.jpg|thumb|''A swanmay in her humanoid shape.'']]
The first swanmay was a [[human]] ranger named [[Fionnghuala]]. Fionnghuala gave her life defending King [[Oberon]] of the [[Seelie Court]] from the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]]. In reward for her selfless bravery and sacrifice, Oberon raised her from the dead and made her a demigod, while his wife [[Titania]] offered her the magic white feather that transformed her into a part-fey being and made her into a swanmay.

==Notable Swanmays==
