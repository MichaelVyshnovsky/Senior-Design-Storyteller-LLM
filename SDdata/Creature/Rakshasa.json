Rakshasas were, in truth, immortal, fiendish spirits that bound themselves to the Material Plane within the guise of flesh, so intrinsically deceptive that their very essence could be used in [[potion of delusion|potions of delusion]]. Despite their immortality, death was excruciatingly painful for a rakshasa as it meant wandering the [[Lower planes]] as an incorporeal being, waiting in unending agony for their bodies to reform.\n\nRakshasas suffered no loss of memory, power or vitality from death but the process landed them in a random spot and could take somewhere between days and years, by which time mortals who had wronged them may have already passed on. When unable to take vengeance upon their killers, rakshasas often avenged themselves upon their kin or allies. Slaying a rakshasa banished to the Lower Planes permanently destroyed them but it was said they could be killed on the Material Plane by driving blessed weapons through their hearts. Every century, a new rakshasa generation would be born to replace their fallen progenitors and the race had been known to spread.": "==Use===",

        "Description": "The true form of a rakshasa was almost never seen due to their ability to assume almost any [[humanoid]] figure, but their lavish taste ensured they were almost always wearing the finest garments and most precious jewelry.\n\nThe eyes of a rakshasa could range from gold and black slits for felines to protruding, multifaceted spheres for insects but always contained a fiendish glimmer of disturbing, infernal intellect. However, their most unnerving and unique feature was their reversed hands. The palms of a rakshasa faced ''out'' from the body when the arms were at rest and the finger joints bent backwards to grasp and manipulate objects.\n\nRakshasas stood {{SIrange|6|7|ft}} tall, with those of lower rank being shorter.",
        "Personality": {
            "Activities": "Upon reaching independence, rakshasa usually attempted to establish their own territories as far away from any other rakshasas as possible, utilizing their mastery of disguise to carefully investigate a region for years while staying insignificant. They instinctually sought out hideaways, safe houses and secret lairs from which to conduct their schemes and display their opulence, their lives often shifting between periods of hedonistic pleasure and unyielding discipline. Thieves' guilds, mercenary companies, business fronts or temples to [[neutral]] [[deity|deities]] were suitable covers and if no such thing could be found, the rakshasa would be forced to create one itself.\n\nAt the same time, they searched for those of weak wills, dark secrets and crippling fears, collecting every possible detail about their hidden vices through their thought detection ability and pre-established connections. If bribery and temptation were not sufficient, they would use extortion and slander, threatening to ruin the target's life if they refused to comply. Spies and informants were monitored by more reliable and easily controlled servants and as their cruel criminal empires spread, subjects under their control, whether a victim of their greed or a knowing servitor, found the rakshasa's demands grow more unreasonable and time-consuming.\n\nMost rakshasas that focused on self improvement, despite already being leagues beyond ordinary mortal casters, tried to improve their sorcerous abilities."
        },
        "Abilities": "Rakshasas were naturally adept sorcerers, able to use a wide variety of [[enchantment]] and [[illusion]] spells to beguile their enemies and [[detect thoughts| detect the thoughts]] of others at will. Only potent, enchanted weapons were capable of properly harming them, but piercing weapons that had been [[bless]]ed, or potentially those wielded by good creatures, were particularly effective. Blessed crossbow bolts and arrows were said to instantly kill them, but it was said they had to be pierced through the heart with such weapons to truly slay them.\n\nRakshasas could shapeshift as long as they desired and their new forms could not be magically dispelled, although [[truesight]] could pierce their guise and they reverted to normal upon death.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Rakshasa 4e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A rakshasa warrior.'']]\nIn the repertoire of a rakshasa, their most powerful weapon was their mastery of misdirection as they used their expertise in deceit they entangle their enemies in webs of mistruths. Their illusory powers and vast array of potential identities made even recognizing their existence a struggle and even then it took skill and careful planning to defeat them. Powerful [[divination]] magic was required simply to dispel their supernatural deceptions but they nonetheless had many ways to win without fighting.\n\nRakshasas had entire networks of corrupt officials and powerful bodyguards at their disposal, and only allowed their most loyal and trustworthy minions near them. Only a small number of their closest aides knew of their true form and so enchantment magic was often needed in order to prompt a betrayal by such servitors.\n\nRakshasas fought as cravens when behind their numerous protections, using magic to enhance their speed or defenses, attempting to use their enchantment magic to dissuade combat and targeting spellcasters due to their typical inability to harm them. Often times they would attempt to masquerade as an ally of their prey, waiting for the right moment to strike them down.\n\nUnless protected by a spell such as [[mind blank]] or [[nondetection]] they would instantly sense the location of thinking creatures, but would need to focus their efforts on a specific area for a few seconds in order to decipher a potential adversary's surface thoughts, forcing them to stay nearby while attempting to discern intentions. When under attack, rakshasas rarely used their mind reading in the open, instead using hit and run tactics to maneuver to an area of safety and read the enemies' plans, allowing strategies to be changed when needed. Offensive magic was normally saved as a last resort and most disdained physical fighting as ignoble.\n\nIn contrast to their typically elusive nature, rakshasas when cornered fought valiantly and fiercely, proving themselves to be dangerous melee combatants in addition to being powerful spellcasters. Their reversed hands gave them no trouble in terms of dexterity, allowing them to wield weapons with dangerous effectiveness, a necessary skill as their shapechanging prevented them from using their teeth and claws. Rakshasas trained as warriors pounced like tigers with their blades while archers were just as deadly. However, most rakshasas took every measure needed to prevent physical altercations and, if the opportunity presented itself, would immediately abandon melee in order to continue casting from afar, attempting to blind and confuse current assailants to escape.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "The rakshasa served the [[lesser god]] [[Ravanna]] a ten-headed being that was the paragon of their tyrannical ideals of decadence, cunning and narcissism. Most [[cleric]]s were chosen by Ravanna based on his needs and desires rather than them coming to serve him and it was practically suicidal by those who knew of him to ignore commands for such summons from his great priests.\n\nHe commanded his servitors to rule and expand from the shadows, giving his clergy the air of a secret criminal organization and was not adverse to choosing members of other races to be part of his priesthood. Befitting a being of such overwhelming egomania, prayers to Ravanna were longwinded and sycophantic while depreciating the value of the speaker. His devotees commonly carried personal shrines with which to make daily sacrifices of blood and coin with their natural armaments, made both artistic and ornate but easily concealable on short notice.\n\nWithin the [[Abyss]], [[chaotic evil]] rakshasas were known to serve another lesser god, [[Kali]]. The [[demon lord]] [[Fraz-Urb'luu]], Prince of Deception, also commanded a great number of chaotic evil rakshasas known as the Hollow Rajahs.",

        "History": "Despite there being innumerable documented cases of rakshasas influencing worldly politics the known examples were but a fraction of the extent of their duplicitous exploits. Scholars that investigated their sinister schemes found that they could be connected to the downfall of several organizations, merchant houses, and churches, the instigators of unspeakable tragedies and the collapse of entire governments. The elimination of investigative scholars was one of the few occasions during which rakshasas would unite. The exact origins of the rakshasas were shrouded in mystery and legend, not helped by the proud and insidious rakshasas themselves that, if they knew their history, would never willingly share it and likely went out of their way to make it confusing and contradictory.\n\nRumors that claimed [[arcanaloth]]s were originally [[demon]]s that were banished from the Abyss for their deceptiveness also stated that they were the ancestors of the rakshasas and [[raavasta]]s. Rakshasas strongly disputed such stories despite their demon-like cruelty, greed, and conniving nature, dismissing them as slurs against their honorable race and an accusation of degeneracy. More recently, it was claimed that the rakshasas were the result of an infernal ritual from Hell, made from an enigmatic but nonetheless powerful race of devils in a bid to escape Baator. Indeed, rakshasas had various hallmarks of devilish descendance and more popular ideas were that they were caused by a union of ancient [[fiendish creature|fiendish]] animals and devils.\n\nStill, it was entirely possible that rakshasas were an entirely distinct race of fiends as their specific brand of malevolence was utterly unique. Many, less specific legends merely stated they came from \"a distant land\" like a poverty-inducing plague to corrupt and drain every society they came across and some said that the horror-inflicting fiends were the manifestation of nightmares.",
        "Notable Rakshasas": "* [[Devang]], a duplicitous vizier to Rajah [[Jasraj Seltrarir]] of [[Estagund]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Loliadac]], a powerful herald of Ravanna and five-headed maharajah with the visages of an ape, crocodile, mantis, tiger and human. He and his army traveled throughout Acheron, the [[Plane of Shadow]] and the Material Plane to exact retribution on Ravanna's behalf.\n* [[Jurrgal]], who impersonated and assumed the identity of Lord [[Terrathy Lightfinger]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n* [[Kalkan]], nemesis and old enemy of [[Demascus]] the [[Deva]].<ref>\n* [[Mahadi]], the manager of the traveling [[Wandering Emporium]] and proprietor of the [[Infernal Rapture]] normally located in [[Avernus]], he also acts as [[Asmodeus|Asmodeus's]] eyes, ears, and sometimes deal-maker.\n* [[Tirumala (rakshasa)|Tirumala]], the rajah leader of [[Tirumala|a city-state]] that shared its name with its ruler.\n* [[Valantajar]], an inhabitant of [[Waterdeep]] who worked as a private investigator under the disguise of Vincent Trench.\n* [[Royappa]], a curious cat that got trapped in the [[Tower of Ruin]]."
