'''Pentaceratops''' ({{Pronounce|pen|ta|SER|a|tops|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was a species of [[dinosaur]] living in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Pentaceratops looked like their cousins [[monoclonius]] and [[triceratops]]. They had three horns and a large bony head crest. They were called pentaceratops, or "five-horned face" due to the erroneous impression they had five horns. The two "horns" on either side of its head were in fact large cheek bones.

==Behaviour==
Pentaceratops were known for being aggressive.

==Combat==
The pentaceratops was well defended against large predators. Its horns made effective weapons and its head crest protected most of its body from a forward attack. It was large enough to simply crush smaller predators with its body.

==Biology==
Pentaceratops were herbivores and lived in herds.
