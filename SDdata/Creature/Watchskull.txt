Watchskulls were magically animated skulls used for various purposes by their creator, Kulshond the Mad Mage, in the 14 century DR.
They were created using a certain spell of Kulshonds invention.
The skulls had no intelligence of their own and could only obey the will of their creator.
The watchskull hovered and flew were the creator willed. They could see, hear, communicate, and even speak command words through these skulls, including multiple skulls at once, but could not cast their own spells.
A watchskull could be used to attack by ramming, or rather headbutting, a target, but this was barely impactful. However, it could be made to explode, dealing a bit more damage to all in  of it, and leaving only non-magical bone dust.
For those folk he got curious about, Kulshond dispatched one of his watchskulls to follow and spy on them. With these watchskulls, Kulshond was known to offer helpful, or taunting, remarks to those he monitored or disrupt their spellcasting or surprise them into dropping something vital in order to interfere with their actions, to lead them to harm, or to warn others.
