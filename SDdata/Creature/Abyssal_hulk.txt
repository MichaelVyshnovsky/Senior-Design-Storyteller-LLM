'''Abyssal hulks''' were a warped offshoot species of [[umber hulk]]s native to the [[Abyss]].

==Abilities==
Unlike the standard umber hulk of the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]], these creatures had [[acid]]ic blood that they were able to spew out at their enemies. And their gaze had a psychic quality to it, being capable of inducing madness in others and temporarily [[charm]]ing them into attacking others.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Abyssal hulks could be found across different layers of the Abyss, burrowing through them and sometimes creating new passages.

===Relationships===
The minions of the [[demon lord]] [[Yeenoghu]] gathered a great many of these creatures and forced them into service as guardians and watchers. These abyssal hulks lurked beneath the ground along well-traveled paths in the Abyss, waiting to rise up and attack passersby.

==History==
Legends claimed that these creatures came about when some of the earliest umber hulks dug so deep that they ventured into other [[plane]]s, such as the [[Elemental Chaos]], and found the Abyss to be a teeming hunting ground. Such legends would go on to say that many of these umber hulks died, but those who survived to feast upon the flesh of [[demon]]s were warped over time.
