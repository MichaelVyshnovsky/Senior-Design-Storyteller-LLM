'''Modrons''' ({{Pronounce|MO|dranz|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) were a race of [[immortal]]s known for their zealous adherence to the principles of law and order above all else. Just as [[fiend]]s were considered the embodiment of evil and [[celestial]]s the embodiment of good, so were modrons the embodiment of the universal principle of order.{{Cite dungeon/186/Creature Incarnations: Modrons}}

{{Quote
|We are the ultimate law. All other law is tainted when compared to us.<br/> We are order. All other order disappears when held to our light.<br/> We are structure. All other structure crumbles when brought against us.<br/> We are perfect law.
|A spokesmodron
}}

==Description==
A modron's appearance was varied and depended on their position in modron society. The most common appearance of a modron was as a geometric shape, such as a sphere or cube. The number of sides as well as structure determined a modron's position in their society. The more sides a modron had, or the more complex their structure was, the higher they were ranked. The highest ranked modrons were humanoid in appearance. 

==Combat==
Modron armies battled the forces of chaos and entropy across the multiverse. They used logic in developing their tactics and followed proven battle strategies. They were relentless in battle, fighting without compassion or remorse, and were willing to sacrifice themselves to achieve their objective.{{Cite dragon/414/Ecology of the Modron|11}}

==Abilities==
All modrons were immune to mind-affecting, emotion-affecting, and magic that drew upon the [[Positive Energy plane|Positive Energy]] or the [[Negative Energy plane]]. They were resistant to cold, fire, and acid. Hierarch modrons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will.

==Society==
Modron culture was simple. Each modron obeyed all commands given to it by any modron one rank higher. These commands were obeyed without question. Modrons were only aware of modrons one rank higher than they were, for example, a quadrone could issue orders to tridrones, duodrones, and monodrones, but would only obey orders from pentadrones. If a modron higher in rank than a pentadrone issued an order to a quadrone, it would view it as some exceptionally powerful pentadrone. All modrons were aware of the existence of Primus, however. Modrons were unwavering in their devotion to order, departing Mechanus to complete strange tasks in the name of law. The modrons served [[Primus]], godlike ruler of [[Mechanus]].

There were fourteen castes of modrons, divided in two major categories:{{Cite web enhancement/The Modrons|2}}

===Relationships===
The [[lillend]]i, guardians of the [[Infinite Staircase]], held a grudge against the modrons for reasons unknown.<ref> [[Slaad]]i detested modrons and had waged epic battles against the forces of Mechanus for millennia.

===Religion===
Hierarch modrons were known to occasionally sponsor [[neutral]]-aligned [[witch doctor]]s as [[divine]] patrons.{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|33}} 

==Physiology==
Despite appearing as mechanical constructs, modrons were not entirely mechanical. Every modron had a mix of biological and mechanical parts, the degree of which was determined by their place in modron society. Lower ranked modrons had more mechanical components integrated within them than higher ranking modrons.{{Cite dragon/414/Ecology of the Modron|9-10}} 

Most modrons had no sense of smell, and no modron had a sense of taste. Modrons used auditory and tactile sensors. Since modrons communicated telepathically while in Mechanus, their sense of hearing was primarily used to detect sounds and to facilitate communication with non-telepathic visitors to Mechanus. Modrons felt pain and physical contact via their tactile sensors and were able to inhibit this as required. All modrons had eyes, with hierarchs having two or more eyes, allowing them to have a full field of vision. 

Unlike most other creatures, modrons had no need to breathe or consume food and liquid to survive. Modrons required regular intake of a unique form of psychomorphic energy. It had the consistency of thick jelly and emitted a faint inner light. It was harvested by monodrones and stored in a large pool in Regulus. Modrons had to intake this substance every few weeks or else begin to degrade.{{Cite web enhancement/The Modrons|3}}

==History==
The [[Giant pantheon|giant deity]] [[Annam All-Father]] acquired the secret of [[rune magic]] for his people from a high-ranking modron by winning a game of lots about a thousand years after the [[giant]]s' [[Thousand Year War]] against the [[dragon]]s.<ref><br/>

Mechanus and the modrons were discovered by [[Netheril|Netherese]] explorer and [[archmage]] Lady [[Polaris]] around {{Yearlink|-346}}, who also magically bound and employed them as guards.<ref>

Around that same time, a group of properly operating (albeit degraded) modrons had been left stranded in the [[Labyrinth]] in the [[Underdark]] after being separated from the previous [[Great Modron March]].

Modrons were sometimes summoned by [[Calishite]] mages,<ref> and could be encountered in the city of [[Waterdeep]].<ref>
