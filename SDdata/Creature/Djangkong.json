        "mainbody": "Djangkong were a type of memedi native to Kara-Tur.\nDjangkong were incorporeal and resembled a human skeleton with transparent bones and black teeth.\nIf a human who led a life of good was buried in an isolated area, djangkong were known to temporarily inhabit the area, to keep the deceased spirit company until it traveled to the spirit world.\nLike all common memedi, djangkong were harmless and avoided all combat.\nIf a human saw a djangkong, they were struck with an effect similar to that of a fear spell. The area within a djankongs crypt was permanently protected from evil.\nDjangkong were solitary creatures. They were lured to crypts by humans to act as guardians. There were several preparations one had to take to attract a djangkong to a crypt. Small carvings of native animals had to be placed as a trail that led to the crypt. The corners of the crypt had to contain a small tse stone that defined the area of the crypt.\nDjangkong were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of Bawa and other islands within the Island Kingdoms. They preferred to dwell within isolated crypts that were surrounded by tall trees.\nDjangkong who occupied a familys crypt had to be given annual offerings of a broom, a bundle of incense sticks, a hoe, meat, vegetables, and a sack containing coins of gold and silver. Djangkong kept their crypt and surrounding area clean and weeded by using the broom and hoe."
