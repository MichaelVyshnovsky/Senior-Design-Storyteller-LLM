        "mainbody": "'''Djangkong''' were a type of [[memedi]] native to [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "Djangkong were incorporeal and resembled a [[human]] skeleton with transparent bones and black teeth.",
        "Personality": "If a human who led a life of good was buried in an isolated area, djangkong were known to temporarily inhabit the area, to keep the deceased spirit company until it traveled to the [[spirit world]].",
        "Combat": "Like all common memedi, djangkong were harmless and avoided all combat.",
        "Abilities": "If a human saw a djangkong, they were struck with an effect similar to that of a ''[[fear]]'' spell. The area within a djankong's crypt was permanently [[protection from evil|protected from evil]].",
        "Society": "Djangkong were solitary creatures. They were lured to crypts by humans to act as guardians. There were several preparations one had to take to attract a djangkong to a crypt. Small carvings of native animals had to be placed as a trail that led to the crypt. The corners of the crypt had to contain a small [[tse' stone]] that defined the area of the crypt.",
        "Habitat": "Djangkong were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of [[Bawa]] and other islands within the [[Island Kingdoms]]. They preferred to dwell within isolated crypts that were surrounded by tall trees.",
        "Ecology": "Djangkong who occupied a family's crypt had to be given annual offerings of a [[broom]], a bundle of [[incense]] sticks, a [[hoe]], meat, vegetables, and a sack containing coins of [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Djangkong kept their crypt and surrounding area clean and weeded by using the broom and hoe."
