        "mainbody": "'''Rhaumbusuns''' were reptilian creatures with a dangerous paralyzing gaze in the steppes of the [[Hordelands]], and in [[Zakhara]].",
        "Description": "A rhaumbusun's relation to the dreaded [[basilisk]] was evident by its eight legs, reptilian appearance, and dorsal spikes. The species had distinct sexual dimorphism: males had glittering scales of purple hue, while females' scales were mostly orange. Otherwise, both sexes were born with a dirty orange coloration that changed as they matured and they were of approximately equal size. The most notable feature of rhaumbusuns was their clear multi-faceted eyes that resembled [[gemstone]]s. An adult's tail reached {{SI|1'|'\"|long=yes}}, while its total length was {{SI|2'|'\"|long=yes}} to {{SI|2'5|'\"|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "When agitated, rhaumbusuns' tails began to flip sideways sharply. They were loudly shuffling and clumsy creatures with short stubby legs that curled inwards under their bodies. They moved in a loud scuttle, making them quite easy to detect even if visually concealed.",
        "Combat": "The paralyzing gaze was its main weapon and defense mechanismâ€”the target needed to meet the creature's stare to be affected. A rhaumbusun's magical gaze reached {{SI|20'|'\"|long=yes}} and could affect one creature per minute. The paralyzation lasted for one to eight minutes. Unlike some other creatures with magical sight, a rhaumbusun's gaze could not be reflected with [[mirror]]s, though the spell of ''[[gaze reflection]]'' could turn the paralyzing magic against itself. However, all rhaumbusuns were immune to each others' gazes. Also, unlike many other magical gazes, a rhaumbusun's sight did not affect the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] or [[Ethereal plane]]s. Rhaumbusuns attacked with a bite when cornered and preferred to target creatures made helpless with the paralyzing stare.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "In the [[Hordelands]], rhaumbusuns inhabited the Central Steppe of the Endless Wastes as well as the [[Quoya]] desert.\n\n[[Maztica]]n rhaumbusuns inhabited the scrublands of [[Metahel]], the [[Pasocada Basin]], and dry lands around the [[Valley of Nexal]].\n\n[[Zakhara]]n deserts and\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], rhaumbusuns scuttled across the desert of the world of [[Athas]].{{Cite book| author = Troy Denning & Timothy B.Brown| title = Dark Sun (Boxed Set)| short_story = | date = 1991| editor = | publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = 1560761040| pages = 76| chapter = }}<ref>{{Cite dragon/173/The Monstrous Side of the Dark Sun World|11}}",
            "Usages": "Rhaumbusuns were hunted for their glittering hides, which were popular as decoration for small items. The reptiles' eyes were a valuable commodity if undamaged and preserved, going for 200 [[gold]] pieces per orb. [[Wizard]]s and alchemists used their eyes to prepare [[ink]] for scribing [[scroll]]s of ''[[paralyzation]]'' and [[potion]]s of the same effect.\n\nDomesticated rhaumbusuns were known to be kept by powerful [[cleric]]s and wizards as pets or guardians. A living pair of these creatures was sold for 2,000 gold coins and eggs for 500 gold each."
