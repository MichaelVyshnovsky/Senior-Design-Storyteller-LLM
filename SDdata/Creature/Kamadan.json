The snakes also possessed a powerful poison with their bites.\nthumb|Failed attempt to tame a kamadan.\nKamadans hunted either alone or in mated pairs.\nSome sages claimed that kamadans were related to displacer beasts, although most recognized that the similarities between them were coincidental and the creatures were unrelated. Kamadans were also known to despise displacer beasts and to attack them on sight.\nA close relative of the kamadan was the kamatlan, a similar creature that was native to Maztica.\nShagambi, one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult, was a wise and virtuous kamadan."
