        "Description": "Kamadans were otherwise identical to leopards, except for the additional six [[snake]] bodies protruding from their shoulders.",
        "Combat": "The typical strategy of a hunting kamadan was to use its [[sleeping gas]] breath weapon to knock its prey unconscious before moving for the kill. The snakes also possessed a powerful [[poison]] with their bites.",
        "Ecology": "[[File:Kamadan 1e.jpg|thumb|''Failed attempt to tame a kamadan.'']]\nKamadans hunted either alone or in mated pairs.\n\nSome sages claimed that kamadans were related to [[displacer beast]]s, although most recognized that the similarities between them were coincidental and the creatures were unrelated. Kamadans were also known to despise displacer beasts and to attack them on sight.\n\nA close relative of the kamadan was the [[kamatlan]], a similar creature that was native to [[Maztica]].",
        "Notable kamadans": "[[Shagambi]], one of the [[Primal_spirit#The_Nine_Trickster_Gods_of_Chult|Nine Trickster Gods]] of [[Chult]], was a wise and virtuous kamadan."
