'''Magma para-elementals''', also known as '''heat para-elementals''' were a type of [[elemental]] composed of magma.

==Description==
These para-elementals had hulking, [[humanoid]] forms composed of entirely of lava and molten rock. Some had whole bodies that were humanoid. With chests, arms, and legs being rock colored. While their hands and feet were more fiery and lava-like. While others only had a humanoid upper-body, mostly made from black rock, while the lower half was an amorphous mass of molten stone. Their eyes and mouth glowed with a reddish light from the fire that burned within them, with the flames being visible from their gaping maws.

Their bodies were generally around {{SIrange|8|16|ft|long=yes}} tall, though magma elementals as small as {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} and as large as {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} could occur.

==Personality==
Like all para-elementals they were wary, cautious, and even unfriendly to outsiders in their home plane. Magma para-elementals were particularly prone to bursting into acts of violence. They also took great pleasure in melting solid objects.

==Abilities==
The heat that radiated off these creatures was similar in effect to the ''[[heat metal]]'' [[spell]]. Whenever wood or other flammable objects were brought into contact with a heated object, or a magma para-elemental, the former would burst into flames.

These creatures were impervious to harm from [[elemental fire]], but were vulnerable to cold-based spells and abilities. They also generally could only be harmed by weapons that had a ''+1 [[item enchantment|enchantment]]'' or greater.

==Combat==
Magma para-elementals loved to charge head first into close-quarters combat and would try to grapple smaller foes if given the chance.

==Society==
On their homeplane magma-elementals lived in large communities.

They almost never traveled alone, typically roaming their home plane in packs.
===Diet===
Magma para-elementals derived a bit of sustenance from melting solid objects, though they did not require sustenance to survive.
===Homelands===
These para-elementals were primarily found in the [[Fountains of Creation|Para-elemental Plane of Magma]],

On the [[Prime Material plane]], they could sometimes be encountered in the deserts of [[Calimshan]] and potentially around the volcano [[Si'rat]].<ref>

===Relationships===
On their homeplane these para-elementals routinely waged war against both [[fire mephit]]s and [[magma mephit]]s.

They were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deity]] [[Kossuth]], who would sometimes send them out to the Prime Material to do his bidding or aid his followers.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some speculated that on their home plane there may exist exceptional magma para-elementals with magical powers.
