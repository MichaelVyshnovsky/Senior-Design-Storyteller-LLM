        "mainbody": "'''Blood horses''', also known as a '''blood pegasi''', were winged, nightmarish equines that resembled a cross between a [[horse]] and a [[dire bat]].\n\nThey were often used as mounts by the [[Zhentarim sky mage|sky mages]] of the [[Zhentarim]].",
        "Description": "Blood horses resembled sleek, lithely muscled horses about {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder and weighing approximately {{SI|1250|lb|k|long=yes}}. Blood horses also had massive bat-like wings with a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} wingspan. They had a jet-black coat and small, pink eyes. The nostrils were oddly flared. Blood horses had hooves that closely resembled talons, and they had sharp carnivore teeth. The tail was thin and hairless.",
        "Abilities": "Blood horses could [[blindsight|see]] by emitting high-frequency sounds for up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. However, a ''[[silence]]'' spell or effect could negate the ability, forcing them to rely on their poor (only {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} at most) [[darkvision]]. They could also [[detect good]] at will.\n\nBlood horses were capable of making an ear-piercing screech to partially deafen and stun potential prey within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} of the blood horse.\n\nWhile flying or walking, a blood horse could easily carry up to {{SI|300|lb|k|long=yes}}. They could less easily carry up to {{SI|600|lb|k|long=yes}}, or as much as {{SI|900|lb|k|long=yes}} with great effort.",
        "Ecology": "Blood horses were carnivores that would eat almost any prey, but they preferred the taste of fresh blood, and were known to pin and drain enemies during combat. They were fickle, cruel creatures that typically lived in warm or temperate forests, hills, and plains.\n\nBlood horses were known to live alone, in pairs, or in herds of 5-8 individuals. They matured at the same rate as normal horses.\n\nBlood horses were fairly intelligent and understood [[Common]], although they could not speak.",
        "History": "Historically, blood horses were originally created by another being and did not naturally appear on [[Toril]]. Their progenitor was a former [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] that later joined the ranks of the [[Zhentarim]].\n\nAs of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a blood horse filly or colt was worth about 8,000 [[gp]]. The cost for rearing a foal was about one quarter that price."
