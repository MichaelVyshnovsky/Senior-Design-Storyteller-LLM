        "mainbody": "Phaerlocks were a twisted species that lived in constant pain.\nPhaerlocks were lizard-like humanoids that stood about  tall and generally weighed about . They had crimson-red, plate-like hide that closer resembled a beholders hide than scales, and had four watery, yellow eyes evenly spaced out around the head. The mouth was filled with sharp teeth, and they had clawed hands and a distinctly reptilian tail.\nPhaerlocks cared little for others and sought only to share their pain.\nPhaerlocks could see all around themselves thanks to their four eyes, and they were exceptionally alert and hard to surprise or sneak past. Additionally, by focusing their gaze on a creature within  of them, they could paralyze it with horrific pain however, this ability did not effect constructs, oozes, elementals, undead, or plant creatures.\nAs an odd holdover from some lost aquatic heritage, phaerlocks could hold their breath for approximately 6 minutes before needing to breathe again.\nPhaerlocks preferred to paralyze enemies at a distance before closing in to attack with their claws and teeth.\nPhaerlocks were solitary, nomadic creatures native to the Underdark, where they normally lived short and hardscrabble lives. They were descended from lizardfolk that were bred and warped by powerful magic at the hands of the phaerimm. This was the cause of the constant, unending agony they felt, and even every breath was painful. A rare few managed to learn mental tricks to keep the pain at bay.\nIn the late 15 century DR, a large number of phaerlocks roamed the mines of Tethyamar as agents of Rezlus and his Banite faction of the Zhentarim."
