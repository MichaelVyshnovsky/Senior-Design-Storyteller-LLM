        "mainbody": "'''Phaerlocks''' were a twisted species that lived in constant pain.",
        "Description": "Phaerlocks were lizard-like humanoids that stood about {{SIrange|6|7|ft|long=yes}} tall and generally weighed about {{SIrange|200|250|lb|k|long=yes}}. They had crimson-red, plate-like hide that closer resembled a beholder's hide than scales, and had four watery, yellow eyes evenly spaced out around the head. The mouth was filled with sharp teeth, and they had clawed hands and a distinctly reptilian tail.",
        "Personalities": "Phaerlocks cared little for others and sought only to share their pain.",
        "Abilities": "Phaerlocks could see all around themselves thanks to their four eyes, and they were exceptionally alert and hard to surprise or sneak past. Additionally, by focusing their gaze on a creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of them, they could paralyze it with horrific pain; however, this ability did not effect constructs, oozes, elementals, undead, or plant creatures.\n\nAs an odd holdover from some lost aquatic heritage, phaerlocks could hold their breath for approximately 6 minutes before needing to breathe again.",
        "Combat": "Phaerlocks preferred to paralyze enemies at a distance before closing in to attack with their claws and teeth.",
        "Ecology": "Phaerlocks were solitary, nomadic creatures native to the [[Underdark]], where they normally lived short and hardscrabble lives. They were descended from [[lizardfolk]] that were bred and warped by powerful magic at the hands of the [[phaerimm]]. This was the cause of the constant, unending agony they felt, and even every breath was painful. A rare few managed to learn mental tricks to keep the pain at bay.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a large number of phaerlocks roamed the [[mines of Tethyamar]] as agents of [[Rezlus]] and his [[Banite]] faction of the [[Zhentarim]]."
