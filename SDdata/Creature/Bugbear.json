        "mainbody": "'''Bugbears''' were a massive [[humanoid]] race distantly related to, but larger and stronger than, [[goblin]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s.",
        "Description": "Bugbears resembled hairy, feral goblins standing {{SI|7|feet|long=yes}} tall. They took their name from their noses and claws, which were similar to those of [[bear]]s. Their claws were not long and sharp enough to be used as weapons, so bugbears often armored and armed themselves with a variety of purloined gear,",
        "Personality": "Bugbears, like other goblinoids, had a reputation for being dim-witted and brutish. This claim was not unfounded, and like their kin, bugbears had easily provoked tempers and were prone to rages. Few bugbears overcame this flaw and their culture's brutal nature. Many bugbears were [[chaotic evil]] in alignment, favoring stealth and surprising their opponents.\n\nBugbear heroes, though rare, were heard of and could acquire significant renown if successful. Often the motivation for this change of heart came from the rewards earned from virtue, which in the long term were more pleasing than the short-term pleasures of evil behaviors.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Bugbear_and_giant_rats-5e.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[Balsag]] and his two [[giant rat]]s standing guard in an underground chamber near [[Thundertree]].'']]",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Bugbears once had their own pantheon, led by [[Hruggek]]. Bugbears often decapitated their enemies as a way to honor Hruggek, who was said to do the same. However, after the Second Sundering, bugbears began to follow bugbear-specific deities such as Hruggek once more.\n\nOther bugbear deities included [[Grankhul]], the bugbear [[deity]] of hunting, senses, stealth, and surprise; and [[Skiggaret]]. Local pantheons often included a god of earth, a god of fertility, and a god of death.",
            "Languages": "In addition to speaking [[Common]] and the [[Goblin language|Goblin]] tongue like other goblinoids,"
        },
        "Biology": "Unlike most creatures, bugbears were particularly susceptible to the effects of ''[[Bowen's flower]]s'', which would knock them out within minutes.",
        "History": "Many scholars of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] believed that bugbears and goblins were both bred by the hobgoblins as slave races, with bugbears serving as elite soldiers.\n\nNine bugbears working for the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] dwelt upon the [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]].\n\nFour bugbears working for [[Yek]] dwelt in the [[Arcane Chambers]] Level of Undermountain, as well as twenty bugbears who served the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]].\n\nEight bugbears dwelt in [[Azrok's Hold]], on the [[Sargauth Level]] of Undermountain.",
        "Notable Bugbears": "* [[Bolgus]] and [[Bulkar]], two bugbears who acted as guards at the entrance of a [[Xanathar Guild]] level on the [[Arcane Chambers]] level of [[Undermountain]].\n* [[Grol]], leader of the [[Cragmaw tribe]] in the late-15th century [[DR]]."
