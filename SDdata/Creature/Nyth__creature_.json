        "mainbody": "'''Nyths''', otherwise known as '''wildfire''' by some [[barbarian]]s of the [[North]], were predatory [[aberration]]s that appeared as glowing balls of light. They were very similar to [[will-o'-wisp]]s, and hence they were often mistaken for them.",
        "Description": "A nyth was little more than a sphere of light, {{SIrange|2|4|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, with hue and intensity both changing as it wished. They were completely silent unless they chose to speak, and most spoke [[Common]].",
        "Abilities": "Nyths had a natural ability to shoot ''[[magic missile]]s'' from their bodies. They could fire one ''magic missile'' every dozen seconds or so, to a range of {{SI|110|ft|long=yes}}. They pulsed brightly when they did so. Moreover, ''magic missiles'' cast at them by other creatures were reflected back at their casters.\n\nRather than being harmed by fire or lightning energies, nyths instead absorbed them. Such energy healed a nyth of its injuries, and when a certain amount was absorbed, it would split into two separate, smaller nyths. This caused bursts of light and sent a multitude of ''magic missiles'' flying in random directions, enough that all living creatures up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} away were hit by up to three.\n\nLike a wisp, a nyth could extinguish its glow, becoming ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'' for anywhere from 12 to 48 seconds. Firing a ''magic missile'' ended their invisibility.",
        "Combat": "They hunted for prey in daytime, preferring to hide in front of the sun to disguise their light. They attacked with their ''magic missiles'' and, if they got close enough, would bite their prey. They used their invisibility to get closer for a surprise attack, or else to escape unseen. They would deliberately fly into fires such as torches to heal any injuries they had.\n\nNyths were also immune to any effect that influenced the mind or morale, including [[:category:charm spells|charms]], [[:category:compulsion spells|compulsions]], and [[:category:Phantasm spells|phantasms]], owing to their alien thought processes.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Homelands": "In [[northwest Faer√ªn]], nyths were known to dwell within the [[Mere of Dead Men]],{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, \"the Black Death\"|53}} the [[Rat Hills]], and [[Ardeep Forest]]."
        },
        "History": "A nyth once haunted the western fringe of the [[Forest of Lethyr]], until a cabal of [[wizard]]s defeated it in a battle that ended with the deaths of all involved. The city of [[Nyth]] in [[Thesk]] took its name from this nyth.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, during the [[Rat Hills Conflagration]] of the Rat Hills garbage dump south of [[Waterdeep]], Waterdhavian patrols spotted a group of will-o'-wisps and nyths amidst the fires and engaged them. Though two guards were slain, they drove off the wisps, but the nyths remained in the blaze. The fire caused the nyths to reproduce exponentially and explosively. They went on to populate the area, with four known in the Rat Hills and lots more in Ardeep Forest by [[1372 DR]]."
