'''Fleshrakers''' were spiny [[dinosaur]]s related to [[velociraptor]]s.

==Description==
A fleshraker stood {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall and wielded a pair of {{SIAdj|6|in|c|adj=long}} hooked claws at the end of each of its limbs. Its back, sinuous tail, and muscled forelimbs were covered in thin spines coated with a clear, glistening [[poison]]. The reptilian snout of the fleshraker featured a maw filled with sharp teeth.

==Abilities==
Fleshrakers normally had a bipedal gait, but were able to run using both their arms and legs. They had an incredible capability to jump.

==Combat==
Fleshrakers typically opened combat by leaping on its target, trying to pin them to the ground and rapidly tear them apart with their claws. If this opening salvo didn't work, the fleshraker would usually try to escape and let its poison ravage its prey before returning to finish the job later.

==Ecology==
Fleshrakers were canny predators that made extensive use of cover. They typically only attacked lone prey, but would sometimes swing at larger groups out of desperation or if the numbers were in their favor. Extended periods of scarcity could even drive them to attack caravans, straying pack [[mule]]s, or wagons with light security.

Forest-dwelling tribes would sometimes domesticate fleshrakers as guard animals, a role they fulfilled effectively due to their natural camouflage and tactical proficiency. It was rumored that some were even used as [[mount]]s, requiring specialized [[saddle]]s to account for the poisonous spines.

===Habitats===
Although they were primarily found in densely forested areas, a population of fleshrakers lived in the barren [[Stonelands]].
