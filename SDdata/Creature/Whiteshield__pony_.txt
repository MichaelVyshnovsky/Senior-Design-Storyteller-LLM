The '''Whiteshield''' was a breed of [[horse|war pony]] from [[the North]] that was favored among the region's [[shield dwarves]].

==Description==
These ponies were quite large and possessed a dense musculature. They were exceptional at traversing mountainous terrain, and were strong enough to support the weight of a [[dwarf]] in [[full plate]] armor. They had thick and shaggy winter coats, which they shed in the hotter months, revealing a rough brown hide.

Whiteshield ponies earned their name from the [[shield]]-shaped patch of white hair that was found on the forehead of pure-breed specimens. Dwarven riders often tattooed or painted their personal heraldry upon this spot, distinguishing their mount from others.

==Availability==
While these ponies were common within the dwarf holds of the North they were rarely made available to non-dwarves. If they were sold to outsiders, they fetched a hefty price of around 1000 [[gp]].
