        "mainbody": "isfortune devils, also called misfortunate devils, were exploitative devils who abused mortal impulses to claim souls for the Nine Hells.\nMisfortune devils were visibly distinct from regular mortals, but might use magic to disguise themselves.\nthumb|right|200px|Jedrezz offering the payment for an assuredly easy job.\nMisfortune devils were charismatic individuals who enjoyed tricking others into poor decision-making. They encouraged addictive habits and manipulated passion with delight, preying on the deep desires of their victims to push them into foolish behavior and unreasonable risks.\nThe powers of misfortune devils were, appropriately enough, manipulative and altered luck in their favor. They could intermittently let out rays of distortion that allowed the target to shunt the effects to a tougher ally, escaping them at their associates detriment. They could psychically attack their enemies before teleporting across the battlefield, hover through the air, and, every now and then, cause an attack aimed at them (whether in melee or at range) to hit someone nearby instead.\nMisfortune devils allowed their allies to engage the enemy before moving to the safest location from which they could let loose rays of distortion. They saved their ability to deflect an attack for a particularly dangerous or hampering one.\nMisfortune devils were one of the many kinds of devils charged with collecting souls for the Nine Hells. They lured mortals into making increasingly perilous decisions that would eventually lead to the devil owning their soul, delivering their enticing messages through underlings or under the magical guise of a trusted friend if their appearance would otherwise frighten a potential mark away. They had a tendency to attach themselves to other infernal forces on their own errand in the hopes of stacking the odds in Hells favor.\n* Magros, a misfortune devil in the service of Levistus."
