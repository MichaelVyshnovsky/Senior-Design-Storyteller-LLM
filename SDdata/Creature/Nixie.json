        "Description": "Nixies were quite [[elf|elven]]-like in appearance. They had typically slim bodies with pale green skin, dark green hair, webbed finger and toes, pointed ears, and wide silver eyes. On average they stood {{SI|4|ft|adj=tall}} and weighed around {{SI|45|lbs.|k|long=yes}}.\n\nFemales typically wore tight-fitting wraps, woven from colorful [[seaweed]], and often braided shells and [[pearl]] strings in their hair. made of the same seaweed material.",
        "Abilities": "Nixies were naturally aquatic creatures who could breathe both air and water. Once per day they could cast ''[[water breathing]]'', with the effect lasting 24 hours.\n\nNixies could also cast ''[[charm person]]'' three times per day, with the effect lasting 24 hours. When a group of ten nixies got together they could cast a powerful ''[[charm]]'' on other humanoids that could last up to a year.",
        "Combat": "Nixies typically relied upon their ''charm person'' ability to deter threats, entering combat only when they needed to protect themselves and their territory. Male nixies were known to wield [[dagger]]s or [[javelin]]s in combat.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "[[File:Nixie 2e.jpg|thumb|''A close-up of a nixie and his webbed fingers.'']]\nNixies dwelled within pristine ponds and lakes that they rarely left. These were always clean and well-stocked with [[fish]].\n\nIn [[Northwest Faerûn]], they inhabited the [[Laughing Hollow]]. In [[Rashemen]], nixies lived in and defended [[Lake Ashane]].<ref>\n\nBeyond [[Faerûn]], nixies were occasionally found in the [[Hordelands]] in the lakes, rivers, and swamps of the [[Ama Basin]] during the summer season. Some pixies inhabited the lakes and streams of the island [[Evermeet]].\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], some nixies could be found on the water world of [[Thalassa]].",
            "Languages": "In addition to having [[Nixie language|their own language]], nixies typically could speak [[Aquan]], [[Sylvan]],",
            "Relationships": "Nixies were quite reclusive, even compared to most fey, and thus had a tendency to treat intruders with suspicion or hostility. Some used their ''charm person'' and ''water breathing'' spells to make creatures perform for their community heavy labor, such as the removal of trash or obstacles, guard duty, and other onerous tasks.  Shortly before ''charm person'' wore off, a nixie would escort the creature away and order them to keep walking."
