Male nixies were known to wield daggers or javelins in combat.\nNixies lived in tribes of 20 to 80 members that controlled a territory approximately  in diameter. They wove their buildings out of living water plants. A typical nixie family had 4 to 8 members and a tribe typically had 10 to 15 families, all descended from a set of common ancestors. When a tribe became too big, 2 to 3 families would split off to form a new tribe elsewhere. Nixies were known to be polygamists, with males having 2 to 3 wives.\nNixies tribes were ruled by an Acquar, or water mother, who was a direct descendant of the tribes founder. The Acquar was advised by a council of elders led by a spokesperson called the Luquar, who was responsible for keeping the oral history of the tribe.

Some used their charm person and water breathing spells to make creatures perform for their community heavy labor, such as the removal of trash or obstacles, guard duty, and other onerous tasks.  Shortly before charm person wore off, a nixie would escort the creature away and order them to keep walking.\nThe Naughty Nixie was a well-liked inn in the city of Yhaunn."
