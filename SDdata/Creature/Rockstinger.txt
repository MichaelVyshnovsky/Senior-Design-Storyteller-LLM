Rockstingers were fish known for being highly poisonous.
They were said to be very ugly.
The poison of the rockstinger was a highly effective defense against predators.
Naturally, rockstinger poison was a valuable and terrible tool for assassins. Even a light nick from a dagger coated with the poison caused agonizing, scream-inducing pain like fire in the victims veins. The effect would then evolve to cause painful muscle contractions that led to copious vomiting. Even after the acute effects of the poison wore off, the victim felt aches and fatigue for days afterward.
During the midâ€“15 century DR, the assassin Barrabus the Gray made use of rockstinger poison while working for Herzgo Alegni. He used the poison to intimidate Lord Hugo Babris of Neverwinter, going so far as to inflict the poison on a helpless guard just to instill fear of its terrible effects. The effects of the poison were so terrible that this demonstration nearly elicited regret from the ruthless Barrabus.
