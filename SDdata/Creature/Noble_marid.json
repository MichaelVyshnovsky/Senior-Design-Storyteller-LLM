        "mainbody": "Noble marids were powerful masters of the oceans.\nNoble marids had pearls for teeth and currents for muscles, making them the strongest and handsomest of all geniekind. Their hair was usually dark grey or blue-black. These genies could assume gaseous (fog), liquid (rushing current), and solid (gigantic humanoid) forms.\nBoth sexes wore the most expensive clothes and jewels that they could afford. They enjoyed intimidating others with their impressive physiques.\nNoble marids could cast the following spells as if they were highly powerful archmages detect evil and good, detect invisibility, detect magic, invisibility, assume liquid form, polymorph self, purify water, gaseous form, part water, lower water, wall of fog, water breathing, airy water, control weather, cone of cold, solid fog, water blast, and maelstrom. \nAll noble marid had the innate ability to walk on water.\nNoble marids were comfortable at any water temperature and were immune to any water- and most cold-based attacks. Steam did not affect them. They were more susceptible to fire-based attacks.\nNoble marids served the Great Padisha of the Marids directly. Most schemed to rule upon her death. Noble marids usually ignored their lesser cousins unless they believed a direct benefit could be achieved to boost their standing in the court, called the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.\nNoble marids traveled in groups that included other noble marids, marids, sea creatures, dragon turtle mounts, and other servants from the Elemental Plane of Water.\nMarid war parties were led by one noble marid.\nNoble marids impacted the other races less than other noble genies since they viewed other beings as inconsequential. Noble marids focused on themselves and had little time for anything else.\nNoble marids who were enslaved by shairs stopped at nothing to get revenge against the shair upon gaining their freedom."
