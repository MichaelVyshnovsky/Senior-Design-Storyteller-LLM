Their legs resembled lightning bolts.\nThese gen were usually very cautious and aloof.\nLightning gen preferred to avoid combat but were quite capable of attacking with shocking bolts. These gen were quite stout compared to other gen, perhaps as a reflection of the powerful masters they served.\nLightning gen served powerful entities as heralds or familiars but they would not respond to shairs the way other gen would."
