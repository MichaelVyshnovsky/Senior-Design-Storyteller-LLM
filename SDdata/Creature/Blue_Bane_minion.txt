A '''blue Bane minion''' was a [[Bane minion]] that was well-versed in fighting and could breathe a stream of electricity.

==Description==
Though these Bane minions could not utilize [[spell]]s, as [[black Bane minion]]s could, they were physically stronger than them. However, they were much more weaker than [[red Bane minion]]s, who were the toughest type.

==Combat==
Blue Bane minions relied on their fighting abilities and their electrical breath attacks. They could sheathe themselves in protective auras.
