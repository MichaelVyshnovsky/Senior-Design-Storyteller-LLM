A blue Bane minion was a Bane minion that was well-versed in fighting and could breathe a stream of electricity.
Though these Bane minions could not utilize spells, as black Bane minions could, they were physically stronger than them. However, they were much more weaker than red Bane minions, who were the toughest type.
Blue Bane minions relied on their fighting abilities and their electrical breath attacks. They could sheathe themselves in protective auras.
