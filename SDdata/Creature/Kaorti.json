        "mainbody": "The '''kaorti''' were a \"species\" of warped humanoids from the [[Far Realm]] that sought to turn the [[Prime Material plane]] into a place more to their liking.{{Cite dragon/358/Ecology of the Kaorti}}",
        "Description": "Kaorti on the Material plane wore form-fitting armor of thick resin and tissue to protect themselves outside of their cysts. Without the armor, kaorti roughly resembled an emaciated human with brownish green skin marked with livid red, pink, and purple swirls; the whole of the skin seemed almost transparent and liquid. The arms and legs were elongated, with three fingers and thumb on each hand, though the digits were little more than boneless tendrils. The palms of each hand constantly secreted a thick green resin.\n\nThe bulbous head of a kaorti was attached to the body by a long neck, and the face (which was, thankfully, almost always hidden behind wrappings of resin) looked like that of a melted spider. Kaorti stood about {{SI|7|ft}} tall and weighed about {{SI|100|lb|k}} on average.",
        "Personality": "Kaorti were a focused people, with little interest in hobbies or idle pastimes. Instead, they were fixated on a single, species-wide goal: to pervert and corrupt the Material plane and conjoin it with the Far Realm. They had an inherent respect and admiration for arcane magic.",
        "Abilities": "Kaortis wielded arcane magic, having a small number of spell-like abilities: once each day, they could replicate the spells ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[disguise self]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', and ''[[spider climb]]''; some erroneous reports spoke of them using ''[[reduce]]''. Additionally, many kaortis had a natural sorcerous talent.\n\nHorribly, kaortis possessed the ability to transform other humanoids into more kaorti or kaorti thralls (horrific, pseudonatural mockeries of their former selves). The transformation took eight hours, and required the victim to be either willing or, more likely, helpless, and for the kaorti's jaws to be locked onto the victim the entire time. The transformation was both physical and psychological, though the victim kept any prior training in the fighting or arcane arts; it was also the only way kaortis had to propagate their species. It was possible for particularly hardy individuals to resist the transformation, though that did not prevent the kaortis from trying again; even more rarely, the transformation was only physical in nature and not also psychological.\n\nThe great vulnerability of the kaorti was that, outside of their cysts or resin suits, the Material plane caused them pain and fatigue, eventually killing them if they could not protect themself.",
        "Combat": "The kaorti preferred to rely on magic during a fight, sending transformed minions and servant-monsters into melee in their stead. If magic failed, a kaorti would attempt to use ranged weapons; if that also failed and melee was inevitable, they would flee if possible. Their physical weaknesses made them poor fighters in melee.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Kaortis created [[rukanyr]]s and [[skybleeder]]s as thralls to aid and further their goal of corrupting the Material plane, and [[kaortic hulk]]s as shock troops. They also brought with them creatures such as [[half-farspawn]], [[amoebic crawler]]s, [[nightseed]]s, and [[urquirsh]] back from the Far Realm.<ref>{{Cite dragon/330/Enter the Far Realm}}\n<!--===Biology===\new"
        },
        "History": "During the [[Dawn Ages]], [[elves]] created the ''[[Vast Gate]]'' in an attempt to make travel anywhere instantaneous and to see what lay beyond the works of the gods. In doing so, the ''Vast Gate'' created a tiny opening into the Far Realm that allowed for an invasion from that plane's inhabitants. The ''Vast Gate'' was sealed forever, but the opening into the Material Plane from the Far Realm remained and slowly grew.\n\nA group of [[Imaskari]] [[wizard]]s who called themselves the [[Quin]] (the [[Roushoum]] word for 'entitled'), discovered ancient tablets detailing the elves' quest for reality beyond reality. Working from what little [[magic]]al lore remained on these tablets, the Quin created the [[Quinspire]] in a much-publicized attempt to bring new magic from the other reality back to [[Imaskar]].\n\nThe Quin succeeded but within minutes of their arrival, they had attracted the attention of a vast [[elder evil]] known as [[Zurguth]]. Zurguth's mere proximity to the unfortunate men transformed the Quin into the first kaortis. Imaskar soon forgot the Quin and little, if any, of their research survived. Part of the kaorti's alien minds recalled something of their previous existence however. This vague memory eventually spurred them to investigate faint traces of Material Plane residue left by the Quinspire, which they traced back to its source with their magic. When they rediscovered the Prime Material, they found it inimical to their existence and were struck by an all-consuming urge to transform it into a place more hospitable to them."
