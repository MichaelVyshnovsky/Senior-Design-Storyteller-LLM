A '''mastodon''' was an ancient relative of the [[elephant]] and the [[mammoth]] that had a long pair of tusks. They were generally greater in length than those of modern elephants.

==Description==
Mastodons stood about {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder and weighed more than {{SI|4000|lb|k|long=yes}}. Though their attributes differed based on their natural habitat, they were generally longer in length and hairier than elephants. Their tusks grew up to {{SIrange|12|15|ft|long=yes}} long, almost as long as their bodies. In cold climates, mastodon species grew long, shaggy fur, but those in snowy environments had shorter tusks.

==Abilities==
Like other elephants and their ancestors, these rare animals were semi-intelligent.

==Behavior==
These creatures were much more ferocious and aggressive than their elephant relatives.

==Combat==
Mastodons usually charged their opponents in combat, throwing their weight behind their attacks. Their foes were also met with a long and powerful set of tusks, meaning they could attack opponents from range. They would trample and gore their foes.

==Usage==
A mastodon could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' [[spell]].<ref>

Only very powerful [[druid]]s were able to use these hulking beasts as [[animal companion]]s.

They were outstandingly strong, and if trained were able to carry up to {{SI|12580|lb|k|long=yes}} and haul up to about {{SI|62400|lb|k|long=yes}} worth of cargo.

==Ecology==
These huge animals could adapt to live in many types of environments, from cold and temperate forests to jungles and tropical islands. Mastodons often organized themselves into small groups and herds of up to six.

Mastodons were fairly rare throughout [[Faerûn]], but could sometimes be found in the company of [[frost giant]]s. They were more common to the far east of the continent, close to the boundary of [[Kara-Tur]].

[[Thayan]]s were known to purchase [[ivory]] tusks of mastodons for about 500 [[gp]] each.

==History==
Mastodons were once far more prevalent across Faerûn, found as far as [[Vaasa]] and [[Damara]]. Expansive civilizations drove them further to the east, even to the [[Hordelands]], where they still existed by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. However, their population was known to be slowly decreasing.
