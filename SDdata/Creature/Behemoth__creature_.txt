'''Behemoths''' were a rare, monstrous relative of the [[hippopotamus]].

==Description==
Behemoths largely resembled a hippo, but their mouths had two large outward-pointing tusks that projected from each side of their mouth. These were primarily used for uprooting aquatic plants and roots.

==Behavior==
These creatures had a basic animal level of intelligence.

Male behemoths were typically aggressive, while females were only known to be aggressive when in the company of their calves. They were liable to attack boats or canoes that entered their territory, rising up from under them and making the craft flip over.

==Biology==
Behemoths traveled within water by sinking their bodies and running along the river or lake's submerged ground. They were capable of remaining submerged for up to thirty minutes.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Behemoths were known to inhabit deep rivers and lakes in tropical regions.

In the ''Realms'' they could be found in the rivers of [[Chult]] and in [[Kara-Tur]]'s tropical and subtropical forests, swamps, and bodies of freshwater. Such as the [[Akari|Akari island]].
