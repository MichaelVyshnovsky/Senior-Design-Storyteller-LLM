'''Golems''' ({{Pronounce|GO|lemz|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) were several types of magically created [[construct]]s. They were mindless, emotionless creations that knew only how to fulfill the orders of their creators.
{{quote|''A golem is a lifeless puppet - a magical force provides the animation. This golem was moved by an earth spirit, though it's gone dormant. It can be reawakened...with the proper techniques.''|[[Safiya]], [[Red Wizards of Thay]]}}

==Abilities==
They were tough, fearsome combatants with incredible defenses. Although they moved like living creatures, they were merely animated objects, giving them several advantages and disadvantages in battle. As constructs, golems were innately immune to a number of attacks; among these were mind-altering, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease and death effects as well as most spells. They possessed both [[low-light vision|low-light]] and [[darkvision]] and they were mindless.

==Creation==
The creator of a golem was typically a [[wizard]] or a [[cleric]], both of whom had control over the creature. They can issue simple commands as long as they are within 60' of the construct. The creation process involves a spirit from the [[Plane of Earth]] being bound against its will into that of the golem.

==Types of Golems==
===Organic===
* [[Blood golem]]: A golem made from coagulated blood, usually encased in armor.<ref>[[Eric Cagle]], [[Jesse Decker]], [[James Jacobs]], [[Erik Mona]], [[Matthew Sernett]], [[Chris Thomasson]], and [[James Wyatt]] (April 2003). ''[[Fiend Folio 3rd edition|Fiend Folio]]''. ([[Wizards of the Coast]]), pp. 84â€“85. ISBN [[Special:BookSources/0-7869-2780-1|0-7869-2780-1]].
* [[Bone golem]]: Evil creatures made from the bones of [[animate dead|re-animated]] skeletons that were subsequently destroyed.
* [[Brain golem]]: A creation of the [[mind flayers]], these existed purely for the desires of the illithids and were unswayed from their goals. They appeared as huge, burly humanoids with oversized brains for heads. In fact, the whole body was made up of brain tissue. Brain golems were more intelligent than other golems.
* [[Demonflesh golem]]: Demonstrating truly fiendish grafting of demonic body parts assembled into a vile whole. These resembled flesh golems. Most were reasonably intelligent. The making of demonflesh golems had become close to a sport on some levels of the Nine Hells.
* [[Dragonbone golem]]: Crafted from the skeletons of one or more [[dragons]] and wired together into a gruesome whole, these were easily mistaken for [[skeletal dragon]]s or [[dracolich]]es. They waded into combat without hesitation as commanded by their creators.
* [[Dragonflesh golem]]: Made out of the remains of dead [[dragons]], these creatures could remember more complicated commands than most golems could, but because they could not think, they obeyed commands to the letter rather than evaluating the intent.
* [[Fang golem]]: An abomination created by a [[druid]] made of claws, fangs and tusks.
* [[Flesh golem]]: These golems were created from human remains. If control over the Flesh Golem was lost, it went [[berserk]], attacking allies and enemies both.
* [[Serpentflesh golem]]: This automaton was a grisly assortment of decaying serpentine body parts grafted together into a gruesome form.

===Mineral===
[[File:Geode_Golem.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A geode golem eliciting startling reactions among folks in the city streets.]]
* [[Clay golem]]: Clay golems were created by clerics. While in combat, there was a cumulative chance as the battle progressed that the golem would be possessed by a [[chaotic evil]] spirit. If this happened, control over the golem was lost and it would attack the closest living creature.
* [[Coal golem]]: A variety of golems constructed out of [[coal]] and cinders by creatures with an affinity for [[elemental fire]].{{Cite web/Monster Mayhem/Coal Golem}}
* [[Crystal golem]]: Crystal golems were constructed from dagger-like shards of purple crystal and were surprisingly resilient given their fragile appearance. They could throw these crystals at their foes as missile weapons.{{Cite dragon/367/Bestiary: Mindless Monstrosities|43}}
* [[Drakestone golem]]: Appearing as beautifully crafted statues of dragons, whose muscles looked like rippling stone flesh when in motion. Their breath could petrify flesh.{{cite book/Draconomicon|164-165}}
* Geode golem{{Cite MTG|CLB|316|{{MTGc|Geode Golem||CLB|#=316}}|[[David Astruga]]}}
* [[Hammer golem]]: A rare variety of golem that was only constructed by [[dwarven]] [[priest]]s.
*[[Mud golem]]: Swamp dwelling, mud golem with empty hollow eye sockets with glowing red spheres in them.{{Cite dragon/302/Bestiary: Construct of Destruction: Five New Golems|59-60}}
*[[Puzzle golem]]: A specialized Stone golem constructed from smaller stone golems that split or reform.{{Cite dragon/302/Bestiary: Construct of Destruction: Five New Golems|61-64}}
* [[Sand golem]]: Sand golems were incredibly evasive constructs that were more intelligent than most golems and could transform into storms of sand.
* [[Spiderstone golem]]: A four-armed obsidian golem carved in the likeness of the drow.
* [[Stained glass golem]]: Made out of stained glass and built to harmonize with a structure's decor so that their presence was not obvious, these were flat, two-dimensional replicas of living beings. When they moved, they produce a tinkling sound like that made by delicate crystal.
* [[Stone golem]]: Golems of stone were twice as powerful as those of flesh. They were highly resistant to attacks because of their stone composition. They did not revoke their creators control like flesh and clay Golems.

===Metallic===
* [[Adamantine golem]]: Incredibly resilient golems that were sometimes found in the [[Underdark]], usually in the service of [[drow]], [[duergar]] or [[svirfneblin]] masters. One of the more powerful variants.
* [[Blade golem]]
* [[Brass golem]]: Made of brass, these were created to fulfill one goal, set at the time of their creation, and wait with absolute patience until activated to perform this task.
* [[Bronze golem]]: Golems that were rather similar to those of iron, but were resistant to rusting due to their [[bronze]] construction.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17-18}}
* [[Chain golem]]: Creatures of the [[Kyton]]s made out of chains, these served as bodyguards for [[devil]]s and as guardians of unholy places. They were composed entirely of shifting chains that varied in size and shape.
* [[Iron golem]]: Iron golems were among the strongest type of golem and never revoked the control of those who created them.
* [[Ironwyrm golem]]: An animated, self-contained furnace built into the shape of a dragon. Smoke trailed from its nostrils except when the creature rested, and when animated, it exuded a palpable heat.
* [[Mithral golem]]: Relatively lightweight golems that moved with astounding agility, frequently surprising would-be adversaries.<ref>
* [[Shadesteel golem]]: Crafted from metal mined and forged entirely on the [[Plane of Shadow]], these silent and powerful guardians were sometimes created by necromancers and powerful undead. They were very stealthy creatures which floated about.

===Elemental===
* [[Hellfire golem]]: Built by [[devils]], these appeared as towering humanoid creatures that seemed to be formed of brilliant lava and crumbling black crust. Most were reasonably intelligent.<ref>
* [[Ice golem]]: A humanoid chiseled out of glacial ice, standing around {{SI|9'|'"|long=yes}} tall and weighing around {{SI|2000|lb|k|long=yes}}. They could be found in [[Rashemen]].
* [[Minogon]]: A swift and deadly [[minotaur]]-like golem created using a furious minotaur soul and a [[fire elemental]].{{Cite dragon/302/Silicon Sorcery: Neverwinter Nights|70}}
* [[Rimefire golem]]: Rimefire golems were powerful beings made of living ice that were thuggish and had little regard for their own well-being.{{Cite dragon/367/Bestiary: Mindless Monstrosities|43-44}}

===Other===
* [[Alchemical golem]]: Weighing {{SI|800|lb|k}}, these humanoid golems were composed from a single tough membrane filled with toxic liquids.{{Cite dragon/302/Bestiary: Construct of Destruction: Five New Golems|57-59}}
* [[Aphelda's vendor golem]]: A construct built solely to function as a shopkeeper.
* [[Half-golem]]: A fusion of a creature with golem parts.
*[[Rope golem]]: Rope golems, also called Hangman golems, were wrapped and shaped in vague humanoid shapes. It only communicated with the twisting sounds of its [[rope]]s.{{Cite dragon/302/Bestiary: Construct of Destruction: Five New Golems|60-61}}
* [[Web golem]]: Built by [[drow]] sorcerers, these were approximately humanoid and were built from masses of spider web. They typically had eight eyes about their head and poisonous spiders fangs.{{Cite dragon/302/Bestiary: Construct of Destruction: Five New Golems|57}}

==Notable Users==
A variety of gods [[favored monster|favored]] golems and used them as servants. These included [[Azuth]], [[Gond]], [[Oghma]], and [[Thoth]]. [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], [[Geb]], [[Red Knight]], and [[Segojan Earthcaller]] specifically favored [[stone golem]]s, while [[iron golem]]s were used by [[Flandal Steelskin]] and [[gem golem]]s by [[Nephthys]]. [[Velsharoon]] favored [[flesh golem]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}
