Golems () were several types of magically created constructs. They were mindless, emotionless creations that knew only how to fulfill the orders of their creators.
They were tough, fearsome combatants with incredible defenses. Although they moved like living creatures, they were merely animated objects, giving them several advantages and disadvantages in battle. As constructs, golems were innately immune to a number of attacks among these were mind-altering, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease and death effects as well as most spells. They possessed both low-light and darkvision and they were mindless.
The creator of a golem was typically a wizard or a cleric, both of whom had control over the creature. They can issue simple commands as long as they are within 60 of the construct. The creation process involves a spirit from the Plane of Earth being bound against its will into that of the golem.
