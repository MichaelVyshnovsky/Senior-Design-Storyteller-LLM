        "Description": "Gelugons were blue and white, insectile bipeds that stood about {{SIrange|10.5|12|ft}} tall and weighed around 700 lbs (320 kg). Their hands and feet ended in claws and their long, thick tails were surrounded in spikes.",
        "Personality": "Gelugons resented the weak and respected the powerful, regardless of their allegiances.",
        "Abilities": "Gelugons were savage warriors that fought their enemies with their claws, pincers and tails. The body of a gelugon, but particularly the tail, was surrounded by an aura of numbing cold that slowed those they struck. They were also known to freely exude an aura of fear that caused most to run in terror, and slowly regenerated when not harmed by [[good]]-aligned [[spell]]s or weapons.\n\n[[File:Icecaster.png|thumb|left|200px|A gelugon using icy magic]]\n\nAn ice devil's magical abilities allowed them to fly, and manipulate the cold in various ways, but their ability to create [[wall of ice|walls of ice]] was particularly chilling, freezing those that approached them and dissipating into dangerously frigid air when destroyed. They had a wide variety of devils they could attempt to gate in for assistance, including [[lemure]]s, [[barbazu]]s, [[osyluth]]s, or another ice devil.",
        "Combat": "[[File:NoCoverD367.png|thumb|right|250px|''A gelugon and its [[legion devil]] soldiers are shocked.'']]\nThe wicked savagery of the gelugons was fully displayed when they were not leading soldiers into battle, as their hatred for weakness led them to destroy their frailest foes first.\n\nHowever, the ice devils were also goal-oriented, fighting only if needed to complete their mission but never backing away from necessary battles or easy victories. Because of the important nature of their work, it was possible that losing ice devils would be fortunate enough to have a pit fiend come to their aid.\n\nThey favored unarmed combat, destroying their targets with their numerous natural weapons or by using their supernatural abilities to send enemy ranks into disarray. Despite this martial preference, one in four gelugons wielded barbed [[spear]]s so chilling that most were paralyzed by their frost.",

        "Ecology": {
            "Usages": "The [[enchanted]] [[spear]] called ''[[Gelugon's Gouge]]'' was crafted out of an ice devil's tail barb."
        },
        "Biology": "The eyes of these creatures were capable of seeing in both [[Darkvision|total darkness]] and the [[ultravision|ultraviolet spectrum]]. In addition, gelugons were capable of viewing their surroundings [[blindsight|without their visual senses]].",
        "History": "In the ancient past, the gelugons were a race of mercenary fiends similar to the [[mezzoloth]]s. The archdevil [[Mephistopheles]] managed to trap their kind in a state of perpetual servitude millennia ago and turned them into denizens of the Nine Hells.\n\nGelugons had been driven to the fringes of their frozen domain due to Mephisto's obsession with developing a new form of magical hellfire. Despite their self-imposed exile, gelugons were still the most numerous residents of Cania, but had been supplanted as the favorite servants of their archdevil by beings like the pit fiends who were capable of aiding their lord's research. Although uncertain on whether to try and persuade or overthrow Mephistopheles, no ice devil openly criticized his decision, instead targeting their aggression at those who encouraged his behavior.",
        "Notable Gelugons": "* [[Vreesar]] was a gelugon that led an attempt to conquer [[Toril]] from a ''[[portal]]'' in the [[Great Glacier]] in [[1366 DR]]. He was stopped by a [[Harper]] [[ranger]] named [[Martine]] and a former [[paladin]] named [[Vilheim]].\n\n* [[Zaguror]] was an adamant gelugon supervisor for a museum of frozen baatezu rivals within Stygia.\n\n* [[Yoggaa]] was an ice devil wizard responsible for the upkeep of Mephistopheles's Frost Garden. The sarcastic, gelugon gardener continually blasted the sculpted plants with [[cone of cold]] spells to prevent [[Mephistar]]'s strange heat from melting them.\n\n* [[Tuncheth]] was an irritable ice devil, devoted to restoring the gelugons to their former position as Mephistopheles's favored servitors. On one front he attempted to discredit the pit fiend known as Quagrem, a key researcher of hellfire magic, by sending his agents to discover or plant evidence of foul play against him. He also was in charge of developing a theoretical form of frost magic known as the Plume, in order to end the Cold Lord's fixation on the un-Canian hellfire."
