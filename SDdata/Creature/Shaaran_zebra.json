        "Society": "The striped steeds of the Shaar were difficult to separate from their herd. Unlike other breeds of horses, zebras lived in a social structure that resembled a harem, with one polygamous male living among a group of many females.",
        "Description": "The zebras were short, but light equine with heavy heads and full, thick manes. Their most unique characteristic was the distinct, vertical black and white striping of their coats.\n\nRather than a typical neigh or whinny common among other equines, zebras had a distinctive \"bark\", unique to their breed."
