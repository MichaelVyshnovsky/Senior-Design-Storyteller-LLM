'''Gigantopithecus''' ({{Plural|gigantopitheci}}) was a rare species of ancient [[ape]] believed to be extinct.{{Cite dragon/95/The many shapes of apes|38}}{{Cite dragon/95/The many shapes of apes|39}}{{Cite dragon/137/Into the Age of Mammals|45}}

==Description==
They were huge compared to most apes, standing at a height of {{SI|8|feet|long=yes}} with very broad builds. They appeared as [[ogre]]-sized [[gorilla]]s, with females weighing about {{SI|600|pounds|k|long=yes}} and having strength equivalent to that of a [[troll]] while males weighed somewhat more and had strength comparable to that of a [[hill giant]].

==Behavior==
Gigantopitheci were similar to gorillas in temperament and habits. They were largely shy and peaceful creatures, making them harmless if given space. Their suspicious natures led them to avoid confrontation, but also meant that they were aggressive when threatened. If angered, they feared next to nothing aside from [[fire]] or large numbers of [[human]]s. They fought with their fists and teeth.

==Ecology==
While native to tropical forests like most apes,

A band of gigantopitheci consisted of one male and several females with their offspring. Such bands could include up to twenty individuals, but more commonly consisted of between two and eight family members, with approximately one in five being juveniles.

===Diet===
[[File:Gigantopithecus - Bob Maurus.PNG|thumb|300px|A gigantopithecus prowls for food.]]
They largely ate [[seed]]s, [[tuber]]s, and bits of vegetation, and particularly enjoyed [[arrowroot]]. They might also eat small [[animal]]s if they managed to catch them, and if they had access to a human settlement, they might raid farms.

===Uses===
The teeth of a gigantopithecus were regarded as trophies by Chultan [[hunter]]s.

==History==
As of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, these apes were believed to be extinct, with only scattered bones attesting to their existence. Fossilized gigantopithecus teeth could be found in [[apothecary]] shops of [[Port Nyanzaru]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

During the time of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} a member of the [[Hunters' Guild of Chult]] named [[Desha|Desha of the Shadows]] learned of a gigantopithecus living in the ruins of [[Omu]], and devised a plan to lure it out with a particularly massive sample of arrowroot.
