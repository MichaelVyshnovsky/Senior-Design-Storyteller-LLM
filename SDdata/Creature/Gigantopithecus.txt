Gigantopithecus () was a rare species of ancient ape believed to be extinct.
They were huge compared to most apes, standing at a height of  with very broad builds. They appeared as ogre-sized gorillas, with females weighing about  and having strength equivalent to that of a troll while males weighed somewhat more and had strength comparable to that of a hill giant.
Gigantopitheci were similar to gorillas in temperament and habits. They were largely shy and peaceful creatures, making them harmless if given space. Their suspicious natures led them to avoid confrontation, but also meant that they were aggressive when threatened. If angered, they feared next to nothing aside from fire or large numbers of humans. They fought with their fists and teeth.
While native to tropical forests like most apes,
A band of gigantopitheci consisted of one male and several females with their offspring. Such bands could include up to twenty individuals, but more commonly consisted of between two and eight family members, with approximately one in five being juveniles.

They largely ate seeds, tubers, and bits of vegetation, and particularly enjoyed arrowroot. They might also eat small animals if they managed to catch them, and if they had access to a human settlement, they might raid farms.
The teeth of a gigantopithecus were regarded as trophies by Chultan hunters.
As of the mid&ndash14 century DR, these apes were believed to be extinct, with only scattered bones attesting to their existence. Fossilized gigantopithecus teeth could be found in apothecary shops of Port Nyanzaru as of the late 15 century DR.
During the time of the death curse, a member of the Hunters Guild of Chult named Desha of the Shadows learned of a gigantopithecus living in the ruins of Omu, and devised a plan to lure it out with a particularly massive sample of arrowroot.
