Clay golems were human-shaped constructs modeled out of clay that were usually divinely infused with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth by priests. Since clay was a weak vessel for life, damaged clay golems tended to release the spirit bound to them and would go berserk until completely destroyed or repaired.
Clay golems generally wore no clothes, except for a garment around their hips made of either metal or stiff leather.
