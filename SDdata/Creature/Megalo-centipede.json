Those who managed to overcome it would still suffer acidic burns on their skin.\nIn 1368 DR, megalo-centipedes could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep.\nthumb|A closer look at a megalo-centipede.\nMegalo-centipedes did not cooperate with other members of their kind, living largely solitarily lives.\nMegalo-centipedes were a carnivorous species that preyed upon animals as large as deers. They were even known to attack and feast upon humans, goblins, and orcs.\nThese creatures were adaptable and could be found in a wide variety of terrains and climates.\nMegalo-centipedes were known to inhabit the hills of the Dalelands, Sembia, and Cormyr. As well as the Vast Swamp and Farsea Marshes of Cormyr. They could also be found in the caverns of the Storm Horns and Thunder Peaks, as well as the Midwoods of Cormanthor.\nBeyond Faerun, these creatures could very rarely be found in Kara-Turs temperate forests, as well as its tropical and subtropical mountains. As well in the neighboring Hordelandss central steppe, the Raurin and Quoya Deserts, and the land of Ra-Khati where they infested the ruins of Kuo Meilan."
