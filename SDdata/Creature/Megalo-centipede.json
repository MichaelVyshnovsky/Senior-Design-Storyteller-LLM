        "Description": "On average these insects grew to be around {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length, over {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} longer than some giant centipedes.",
        "Behavior": "Megalo-centipedes were more intelligent and cunning than their smaller cousins.",
        "Biology": "These creatures had a very virulent, [[acid]]ic [[poison]] that was far more potent than that of smaller centipede species and liable to cause death. Those who managed to overcome it would still suffer acidic burns on their skin.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], megalo-centipedes could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Megalo-centipedes were a carnivorous species that preyed upon animals as large as [[deer]]s. They were even known to attack and feast upon [[human]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[orc]]s.",
            "Habitats": "These creatures were adaptable and could be found in a wide variety of terrains and climates.\n\nMegalo-centipedes were known to inhabit the hills of the [[Dalelands]], [[Sembia]], and [[Cormyr]]. As well as the [[Vast Swamp]] and [[Farsea Marshes]] of Cormyr. They could also be found in the caverns of the [[Storm Horns]] and [[Thunder Peaks]], as well as the [[Midwood]]s of [[Cormanthor]].\n\nBeyond [[Faerun]], these creatures could very rarely be found in [[Kara-Tur]]'s temperate forests, as well as its tropical and subtropical mountains. As well in the neighboring [[Hordelands]]'s central steppe, the [[Raurin]] and [[Quoya Desert]]s, and the land of [[Ra-Khati]] where they infested the ruins of [[Kuo Meilan]]."
