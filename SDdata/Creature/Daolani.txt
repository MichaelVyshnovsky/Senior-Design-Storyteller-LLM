Daolani, or sand gen, were gen native to the Elemental Plane of Earth. They were also sometimes called earth gen.
Sand gen had tanned skin and dark black hair. Their squat bodies made them appear almost circular in shape. Sand gen moved about with clunkiness.
Daolani were the most direct of all gen. They were never shy about telling their masters what they wanted. These selfish creatures lacked sympathy for anyone in trouble.
Unlike their cousins, the mighty dao, these gen did not covet gems save for the occasional snack.
