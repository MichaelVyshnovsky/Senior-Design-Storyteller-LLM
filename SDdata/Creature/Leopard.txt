'''Leopards''' were a species of large [[feline]]s.

==Description==
Leopards had lithe, slender bodies with short legs. They had rosette-shaped spots, as did [[jaguar]]s.

==Combat==
Leopards attacked prey by leaping on them from above. They had very sharp claws that caused significant damage. 

==Abilities==
Their powerful hindquarters allowed a leopard to jump up to {{SI|25|ft}}. They were adept climbers and swimmers. 

==Habitat==
Leopards dwelt in tropical jungles as well as forests. They could also be found living in deserts, mountains and plains. Leopards spent a good portion of their day in the treetops. They slept there and when they caught prey, they preferred to drag the prey up into the treetops to be eaten. the [[Kun-Yen Shan]] mountains, the [[Methwood]], and the jungles of [[Chult]].

In [[east Zakhara]], they could be found in the [[Grey Jungle]]. And in the [[Crowded Sea]] south of [[Zakhara]], leopards could be found on the [[Djinni's Claws]] island chain.

==Biology==
Leopards were solitary creatures. They were obligate carnivores and hunted large animals such as [[antelope]]s. Leopards hunted both during the day and at night, but if they lived in an area with many [[humanoid]]s, they usually only hunted at night. After mating, a female leopard gave birth to a litter of up to three cubs, who remained by their mothers side for two years. 

==Notable Leopards==
*[[Elynna]], the president of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] in [[Cormyr]], had a pet leopard who was mostly harmless and could often be found in the jungle-like plant-filled room of the club in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[Maerovyna]], a [[druid]] of [[Chauntea]] who led the [[Harvest House]] in [[Daggerford]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], was served by two [[pixie]]s, a [[grizzly bear]], and a leopard who were ready to defend her with their lives.

==Trivia==
* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']]'' ''sold leopard hides for 22 [[gp]] a piece.
* Several features of the Realms bore the name of the great cat, such as the [[Black Leopard Cult]] from [[T'u Lung]]<ref>
* The spell ''[[conjure animals]]'' could summon a leopard to the aid of its caster.<ref>
