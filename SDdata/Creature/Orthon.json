        "mainbody": "The masters of the Nine Hells, whether they be pit fiends, archdevils, or the archdukes themselves, had a number of uses for orthons.  Usually the task of locating and either eliminating or capturing a target was given to them, even if their quarry was on another plane of existence.\nIn the absence of an assignment, orthons might work for anyone promising dangerous enemy encounters. Their wide-reaching travels made them unrivaled guides through all the Nine Hells, They roamed that layer in packs, searching for opponents and allying with any infernal agent who guaranteed battle.\nSince their abilities were nearly as dangerous to their fellow devils as they were to their demonic opposition, most of their kin treated orthons well. Often they were paired with legion devils, and the rage devils enjoyed watching them be slaughtered during the combat. Conversely, they admired hell knights and followed them into battle without question, even as the narzugons treated them like mindless chattel.\nOrthons did usually carry treasure, but in the form of combat mementos, such as jeweled weapons, shields, belts, and other baubles.\nthumb|right|250px|A hellbreaker avoiding a pair of patrolling orthons.\nOrthons found in the Prime Material plane were usually under the sway of a dangerous individual. Diabolic cults might summon them to fight a hated foe, but their services were not limited to infernal warlocks and the like mad despots and rampaging warlords could also find themselves with the services of an orthon. However, a strong and steady hand was needed to control a rage devil, and if control was lost, orthons could pose just as much of a threat to weak leaders as they could to those they wanted destroyed.\nOrthons were the result of an experiment to create a new breed of devils to fight the Blood War, one capable of combating demons in the field of brute strength. To do this, demon ichor was injected into hell knights, which turned them into chaotic and uncontrollable creatures that were no longer truly devils. They craved carnage and raged against devils and demons alike, and only became true devils again when the ritualists bound their wild nature with glyphs in Supernal, the language of the gods.\nDuring the period where the Blood War cooled around the 14 century, rage devils began to battle creatures not of the Abyss, even if they would still prefer to fight the demons.\n* Scarbel, an orthon bounty hunter with an impressive retrieval record who sought to capture the meddling cleric Dara.\n* Spurhund, an orthon desperate to capture Dara out of fear of angering General Everbleed.\n* Talmar, an orthon seeking to repay his life debt to the rakshasa Mahadi, although not so much as to risk his own life.\n* Wyrzoon, an ambitious orthon agent of Zariel. Their dealings with the generally unimaginative and unintelligent lesser devils led them to frequently overestimate their own intelligence.\n* Yurgir, an orthon mercenary who became trapped on Toril for much of the 15 century."
