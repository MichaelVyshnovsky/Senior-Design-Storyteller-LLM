Giant ticks were massive bloodsucking insects.
Some described these parasites as being the size of boars.
Much like their smaller cousins, giant ticks were known to carry fatal diseases that could kill a victim within 2–4 days.
Giant ticks hid on elevated rock formations and trees waiting for a warm-blooded prey to drop onto. On a successful bite with their hollow mouth-tube, the giant tick attached to the victim draining its blood until the insect was full and bloated.
After a giant tick attached to its victim, it had to be killed, burned, or immersed in water for it to detach before it reached satiation.
In 1357 DR and up to 1368 DR, giant ticks could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep.
These creatures were willing to consume the blood of any creature they could catch, including giants.
Giant ticks were commonly found in forests and occasionally in caves or caverns. They could also be found in many of Cormanthors forests, particularly in the Vale of Lost Voices. In Interior Faerûn, they could be found in the jungle within the Cathedral of Emerald Scales.
