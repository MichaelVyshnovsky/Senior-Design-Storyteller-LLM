'''Giant ticks''' were massive bloodsucking insects.

==Description==
Some described these parasites as being the size of [[boar]]s.

==Ability==
Much like their smaller cousins, giant ticks were known to carry fatal [[disease]]s that could kill a victim within 2–4 days.

==Combat==
Giant ticks hid on elevated rock formations and trees waiting for a warm-blooded prey to drop onto. On a successful bite with their hollow mouth-tube, the giant tick attached to the victim draining its blood until the insect was full and bloated.

After a giant tick attached to its victim, it had to be killed, burned, or immersed in water for it to detach before it reached satiation.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]] and up to [[1368 DR]], giant ticks could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].

==Ecology==
===Diet===
These creatures were willing to consume the blood of any creature they could catch, including [[giant]]s.
===Habitats===
Giant ticks were commonly found in forests and occasionally in caves or caverns. They could also be found in many of [[Cormanthor]]'s forests, particularly in the [[Vale of Lost Voices]]. In [[Interior Faerûn]], they could be found in the jungle within the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]].
