A '''living muck''' was an [[ooze|oozing]] mass of filth.

==Description==
Living mucks were described to be pudding-like creatures. As such, they were dark, featureless blobs.

==Combat==
Attacking such a creature with metal [[weapon]]s would cause the weapons to be destroyed. Thus, usage of ranged [[magic]] or wooden weapons was often the best way to deal with them.

As with other oozes, they had a large array of resistances and immunities. Living mucks were completely immune to [[acid]], lightning, and [[poison]], as well as resistant to [[fire]]. Cold-based magic would usually harm the creatures.

==Ecology==
Living mucks were known to serve the [[Dark God]], and resided in the [[Temple of Lathander (Myth Drannor)|Temple of Lathander]] in [[Myth Drannor]].
