'''Nightcrawlers''' were a massive, deadly form of [[nightshade]] found in the [[Shadowfell|Plane of Shadows]].

==Description==
Nightcrawlers resembled [[purple worm]]s, but were covered in solid black, chitinous armor. Even the teeth and the inside of the mouth were black. They were approximately {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} long and weighed {{SI|55000|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Biology==
Being a type of undead, these creatures did not need to eat, drink, or breath to survive.

===Senses===
Nightcrawlers were better at burrowing through the ground than walking over it. They had both tremorsense and darkvision.

==Abilities==
Like all nightshades, nightcrawlers radiated a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} desecrating aura. However, they greatly disliked natural daylight, being creatures of utter darkness.

Nightcrawlers had a number of [[spell]]-like abilities, being able to cast ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[greater dispel magic]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', and ''[[unholy blight]]'' at will. They could summon undead creatures each night; the undead served for up to an hour. Nightcrawlers could summon nine to sixteen [[shadow]]s, three to six [[greater shadow]]s, or two to four [[dread wraith]]s this way.

==Combat==
They typically attacked by burrowing, then bursting out of the ground to swallow victims whole. When they did, their victim's body was drained of its life energy.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
These creatures had an inescapable craving for the life force of other creatures, though it was not a dietary requirement. Being a type of undead, they had no dietary needs.

===Relationships===
Nightcrawlers were a [[favored monster]] of the [[gnome]] deity [[Urdlen]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}} As such, he sometimes called them to the [[Prime Material plane]] for short periods in order to conduct some sort of task.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}}
