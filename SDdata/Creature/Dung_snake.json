        "mainbody": "ung snakes were a species of aquatic constrictor snake. They were among the species considered serpents.\nDung snakes had brown scales that were coated in a slime that gave off a strong odour.\nWhen faced with cold weather conditions, the body of a dung snake would exude a protective slime around itself. This slime provided dung snakes with a measure of resistance to cold. They also had a natural immunity to disease and were capable of quickly healing from an injury.\nDung snakes attacked their prey while in water. They wrapped themselves around its prey, constricting and dragging them underwater. They anchored themselves to its prey by biting them with their sharp fangs. Once submerged, dung snakes held on to its prey until they drowned.\nDung snakes got their name from their instinct to seek out warmth in compost piles and dung heaps when the weather turned cold. They would burrow deep into these compost piles, dung heaps, cesspools, or other source of decomposition-based warmth and sleep there until either disturbed or warm weather returned to the local area.\nDung snakes were found in cesspools, marshes and wetlands. They were known to live within the Marsh of Chelimber, the Rat Hills and the River Sargauth in Undermountain.\nDung snakes were a common familiar used by spellcasters."
