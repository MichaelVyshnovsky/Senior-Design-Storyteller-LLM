        "mainbody": "'''Hound archons''' were the guardians of the first and second layers of [[Celestia]]. While typically associated with the gods of the [[House of the Triad]],{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}} They were one of the most common archons summoned to the [[Material Plane]],",
        "Description": "Hound archons appeared as powerfully built [[humanoid]]s with canine heads, with broad shoulders and massive, powerful fists. Hound archons had similarly strong legs&mdash;a silent warning to foes that a hound archon was also swift on its feet, and if they fled, they would not get far.\n\nAll hound archons could be observed wearing simple metal collars about their necks. This collar was not actual metal; it was a mystical representation of the archon's rank within the hierarchy of the archons of Celestia and could not be removed.",
        "Personality": "When one looked upon a hound archon, he or she sensed a feeling of simultaneous peacefulness and readiness for action. Hounds were intelligent and very protective, seeking to defend the innocent and helpless against evil.\n\nDespite their combat skill, like all archons, hounds preferred not to fight if at all possible, and would usually only be driven to combat if protecting themselves, their plane, or their [[lantern archon]]s or others who are unable to defend themselves.\n\nLike all archons, a hound's ultimate goal was to ascend to higher state of goodness and eventually become one with the plane. In the meantime, they served as proxies of the deific powers.",
        "Abilities": "Hound archons could transform at will into any canine ([[fox]], [[dog]], or [[wolf]], ''etc.'') They were not [[lycanthrope]]s, however!\n\nLike all archons, hounds could speak and understand any language they desired and even send a [[message]] in any language over short distances. They could also [[Teleport without error|teleport]] anywhere that they desired without a chance of failure. Hound archons could [[Detect evil|detect the presence of evil]] and also [[Magic circle against evil|protect themselves from it]]. Some claimed that they could further detect all invisible, [[Astral Plane|astral]], and [[Ethereal plane|ethereal]] creatures as well. They could call upon [[Aid|divine aid]] and create a source of [[continual flame]] whenever they desired.\n\nHound archons were immune to paralyzation and electricity. They were resistant to magic and could not be affected by mundane weapons. They could [[darkvision|see in darkness]] and had a strong sense of smell.\n{{-}}\n[[File:Hound Archon 3e.png|thumb|left|125px|''A sketch of a hound archon ready to attack.'']]",
        "Combat": "Hound archons were able and determined combatants in melee, thanks to their musculature and meaty fists. They preferred their natural weapons, In close range, a hound archon was adept enough to strike a couple times with its fists and also take a bite at its opponent in rapid succession.\n\nWhen engaged in battle, a hound archon produced a menacing aura of righteousness that negatively affected its foes' ability to combat with it.",
        "Society": {
            "Creation": "A hound archon came into existence whenever a lantern archon had attained the next station of goodness. Worshipers of the gods [[Tyr]], [[Torm]], and [[Ilmater]] became lantern archons when they died, and so such souls would eventually become hound archons over time.",
            "Promotion": "Hound archons of the lowest rank appeared to wear lead collars. As the archon progressed along a path of goodness, the metal of the collar appeared to change from lead to tin to brass to bronze to silver to gold and at last to platinum. Beyond this point, a hound archon with a platinum collar would be promoted and transformed into a [[warden archon]]."
        },
        "Ecology": "Like lantern archons, hounds seemed to be sustained by the light and essence of the plane of Celestia, and did not need to eat or drink anything else to live. However, they did enjoy eating and drink gifts offered by visitors, provided it was organic material."
