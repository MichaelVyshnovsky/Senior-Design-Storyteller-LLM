        "mainbody": "'''Baelnorns''', sometimes called '''baelnorn liches''', were [[elves]] who chose a path of [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]]-bound duty beyond death which closely resembled [[lichdom]]. They often did so to serve or safeguard their families, communities, or important places,",
        "Description": "Most baelnorn were spellcasters, and  maintained their mental and magical abilities in their [[undead]] state, with some exceptions.",
        "Personality": "A baelnorn could be of any non-[[evil]] nature, mainly [[lawful good]], retaining whatever alignment it had in life. Compared to other types of liches, baelnorn were far less greedy and power-hungry.",
        "Abilities": "A baelnorn retained all memories, personality traits, and abilities from life, but had a virtual eternity to hone and develop its skills further. Thanks to the near limitless time they could devote to studying [[magic]], baelnorns inevitably became extraordinarily powerful spellcasters.\n\nBaelnorns had the unique power to send a [[wraith]]-like projection of themselves out to meet with or converse with others, or to scout an area. These projections could not be ''[[Dispel magic|dispelled]]'' or ''[[Turn undead|turned]]'', and could range out to {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "While as mighty and terrifying as a lich&mdash;such that lesser undead and [[animal]]s would not dare to attack them&mdash;baelnorn lacked a lich's chilling aura of horror that could send weak-willed foes fleeing. Like other powerful forms of undead (such as a [[vampire]] or [[mummy]]), a baelnorn had unnatural powers owing to its state. For example, it could put mortals in a paralyzed state of hibernation with a touch, making them seem dead to others, and could, through their typically powerful magical [[spell]]s, summon other lesser undead as well as ''turn undead''. A baelnorn was capable of sustaining tremendous physical damage and was immune to disease, poison, fatigue, and other effects that affected only the living. However, despite all its undead \"gifts\", a baelnorn considered its greatest resources to be its vast and deep intellect, its supreme mastery of wizardry, and its limitless time to scheme, research, and plan.\n\nIt was not possible to ''turn'' a baelnorn within the locations where it served or guarded.",
        "Society": {
            "Creation": "The method of becoming a baelnorn was a [[High Magic]] or divine ritual The process did not generally require the use or creation of a [[phylactery]], meaning that baelnorns wishing to evade destruction relied on the ''[[clone (spell)|clone]]'' spell. Some less fortunate baelnorns did need to store their souls in a phylactery like a normal lich, in which case they kept it near to the places that they protected or worked."
        },
        "History": "In ancient elven realms&mdash;such as [[Myth Drannor]] or [[Sharrven]]&mdash;baelnorns served as councilors, guardians, and advisors. While many of these stayed out of the public eye, others took active roles in training their families' young [[wizard]]s or protecting travelers. After the city's fall, many remained in the ruins to watch over family vaults or powerful heirlooms. [[Elminster]] once consulted with a number of these baelnorns beneath the ruins of Myth Drannor.<ref>\n\nThe relatively large number of baelnorn in Myth Drannor were credited as being the only reason many elves were able to escape during its fall. Those baelnorn who remained in the ruins were largely involved in protecting the treasures and [[spellbook]]s of their clans.\n\nThe means for creating a baelnorn were truly ancient, even by elven standards. The secrets were believed to have disappeared after the fall of Myth Drannor as no new baelnorns were known to have been created since then (as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]). However, it was possible that some records may have persisted in [[Evermeet]] or [[Evereska]]. By this time, few elves considered the decision to become a baelnorn as a worthy one.\n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[church of Kelemvor]] did not see baelnorn as requiring destruction, and generally preferred to leave them be.{{cite web| author=[[Ed Greenwood]], [[The Hooded One]] | url=http://candlekeep.com/downloads/so_saith_ed-Part-22.zip | title=\"Kelemvor and Good Liches\" in ''So Saith Ed, Apr-Jun 2009''| accessdate=27-12-2021 | date=30-06-2009 | work=[http://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/so_saith_ed.htm So saith Ed]}} However, by the late 15{{th}} century DR their stance had hardened, and they called for the eradication of baelnorns as they did all undead even as it brought them into conflict with some elven communities.{{cite web |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] |https://web.archive.org/web/20200216164414/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1229067419886456834|title= Ed's Twitter |date=2020-02-16 |accessdate=2023-09-30}}\n\nBaelnorns continued to stand vigil in the crypts of Myth Drannor after the city's refounding in the late 14{{th}} century DR. Some participated in the final battle with the [[shadovar]] forces of [[Thultanthar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1487}}.",
        "Notable Baelnorn": {
            "Sy'Tel'Quessir Baelnorn": "Almost all of the [[green elf]] [[Audark clan]] were wiped out fighting [[Venominhandar]] in {{Yearlink|-249}}. After Venom's mate was killed 33 years later, the twelve remaining Audarks, in their grief, appealed to the [[high mage]]s of [[Cormanthor]] to become baelnorns. There was a lively debate among them since no green elf had ever been made into a baelnorn before. Eventually, the mages acceded and transformed all twelve of them.\n\nTheir transformation was not typical. Their skin turned into petrified wood, their hair to moss and their eyes to [[amber]]. They lost all ability to speak but instead of gaining the arcane powers of a typical baelnorn, they instead became prodigious warriors. As the self-appointed guardians of the [[Vale of Lost Voices]], these new creatures found that they could not leave the Vale's boundary, but they could travel instantaneously within it and were telepathically aware of all visitors to their territory. No other green elves subsequently became baelnorns, so it was unknown whether all green elves would undergo a similar transformation or if this was a unique occurrence."
