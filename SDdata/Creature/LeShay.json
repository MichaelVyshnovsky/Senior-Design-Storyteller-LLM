        "mainbody": "A '''leShay''' was an immortal, albino, [[elf]]-like [[fey]] creature of extraordinary magical power.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}",
        "Description": "LeShay were tall and thin and looked like albino elves, with white skin and glossy dead-white hair. However, instead of the red eyes common to true albinos, leShay had deep black eyes; even the whites of their eyes were black. Their ears were pointed, but more closely resembled the ears of a [[half-elf]].",
        "Personality": "A leShay typically was very concerned with proper behavior, manners, and mores and cared strongly about matters of respect.",
        "Abilities": "LeShay had a vast array of magical powers inherent to themselves. Most notable among such powers were their ability to [[Charm monster|charm]] other creatures by simply looking at them and the strange power of forming weapons out of nothing by power of thought alone. These \"leShay weapons\" were formed from the essence of each individual leShay as if they were extensions of his or her own body. LeShay could also [[Alter self|change form]], [[teleport]], [[Greater invisibility|turn invisible]], and [[Water breathing|breathe underwater]] with their magics, among other things.\n\nThe minds of leShay were particularly geared towards the learning of language; that is, all leShay were essentially [[wikipedia:en:Polyglotism|polyglots]]. They could understand nearly any language within only moments of hearing it spoken.",
        "Combat": "Despite their great power&mdash;on par with the oldest of [[dragon]]s&mdash;leShay tended to avoid initiating combat. They were superb fighters, but they preferred to act on the defensive.",
        "Ecology": "LeShay were solitary and could survive in any climate and terrain. They spent most of their time attempting to occupy their attention and amuse themselves. LeShay were immortal; they could not die of old age or illness but only be killed by someone.",
        "History": "[[File:Rebirth of sarifal - Ryan Barger.jpg|thumb|275px|''High Lady Ordalf (second from right) announces the rebirth of Sarifal in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}.'']]\nAt some point in the past, leShay allied with the [[Imaskari]].{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|62}} And in [[1374 DR]] [[Ususi Manaallin]] found an image of seven leShay, each carrying a tome, in Imaskaran ruins, prompting her to wonder if these were the \"more-than-mortal\" creatures that helped make the [[Imaskarcana]].<ref>\n\nAs of [[1479 DR]] only a handful of leShay yet survived on Toril, living in the city of [[Karador]] in [[Sarifal]] on [[Gwynneth]] island. Most of the leShay were reclusive, rarely seen even by most of the city's populace, and served as advisors to the less-reclusive High Lady [[Ordalf]] and her son Prince [[Araithe]] who governed the city.<ref>{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|64}} Around that same time, some elven crusaders who revered [[Lashrael]] opposed the influence of the leShay of Sarifal.",
