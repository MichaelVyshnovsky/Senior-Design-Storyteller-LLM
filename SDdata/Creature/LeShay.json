        "mainbody": "A leShay was an immortal, albino, elf-like fey creature of extraordinary magical power.\nLeShay were tall and thin and looked like albino elves, with white skin and glossy dead-white hair. However, instead of the red eyes common to true albinos, leShay had deep black eyes even the whites of their eyes were black. Their ears were pointed, but more closely resembled the ears of a half-elf.\nA leShay typically was very concerned with proper behavior, manners, and mores and cared strongly about matters of respect.\nLeShay had a vast array of magical powers inherent to themselves. Most notable among such powers were their ability to charm other creatures by simply looking at them and the strange power of forming weapons out of nothing by power of thought alone. These \"leShay weapons\" were formed from the essence of each individual leShay as if they were extensions of his or her own body. LeShay could also change form, teleport, turn invisible, and breathe underwater with their magics, among other things.\nThe minds of leShay were particularly geared towards the learning of language that is, all leShay were essentially polyglots. They could understand nearly any language within only moments of hearing it spoken.\nDespite their great power&mdashon par with the oldest of dragons&mdashleShay tended to avoid initiating combat. They were superb fighters, but they preferred to act on the defensive.\nLeShay were solitary and could survive in any climate and terrain. They spent most of their time attempting to occupy their attention and amuse themselves. LeShay were immortal they could not die of old age or illness but only be killed by someone.\nthumb|275px|High Lady Ordalf (second from right) announces the rebirth of Sarifal in the .\nAt some point in the past, leShay allied with the Imaskari. And in 1374 DR Ususi Manaallin found an image of seven leShay, each carrying a tome, in Imaskaran ruins, prompting her to wonder if these were the \"more-than-mortal\" creatures that helped make the Imaskarcana.\nAs of 1479 DR only a handful of leShay yet survived on Toril, living in the city of Karador in Sarifal on Gwynneth island. Most of the leShay were reclusive, rarely seen even by most of the citys populace, and served as advisors to the less-reclusive High Lady Ordalf and her son Prince Araithe who governed the city. Around that same time, some elven crusaders who revered Lashrael opposed the influence of the leShay of Sarifal."
