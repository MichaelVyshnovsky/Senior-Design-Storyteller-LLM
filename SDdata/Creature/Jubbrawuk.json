        "mainbody": "jubbrawuk was a type of dragon of fantastical appearance and a long neck. The name \"jubbrawuk\" was used by some sages.\nStatues of jubbrawuks were among the statues of gargoyles, gremlins, satyrs, and wyverns that adorned Oldstone Hall and its walls, in Wheloon in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.The name \"jubbrawuk\" likely comes from the poem \"Jabberwocky\". As it appears among actual gargoyles and derives from a nonsense poem, it is possible that the jubbrawuk is a fictional monster within the Forgotten Realms."
