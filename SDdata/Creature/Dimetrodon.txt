A '''dimetrodon''' ({{Pronounce|di|ME|tro|dan|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}), also known as '''sailback''' by the inhabitants of the [[Malatran Plateau]], was a species of ancient carnivorous reptile which lived alongside various [[dinosaur]]s.

==Description==
These creatures bore some resemblance to alligators and were even said to produce a snarl similar to that of an [[alligator]]. The most distinctive feature on a dimetrodon's body was the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_spine_sail neural spine sail] that spanned the length of their back.

==Behavior==
Dimetrodons typically hunted in shallow waters or shores, much like [[crocodile]]s, and spent much of their time sunning atop rocks near these waters. They were generally considered to be highly territorial.

==Combat==
These creatures were very unlikely to ever attack with clears, instead utilizing their powerful jaws against prey.

==Notable dimetrodons==
* [[Mountain Thunder]], a racing dimetrodon from [[Port Nyanzaru]].
* The [[dwarf]] [[Kyer Wyrmheart]] was known to keep pet dimetrodons.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Dimetrodons were common to areas where other dinosaurs lived,
