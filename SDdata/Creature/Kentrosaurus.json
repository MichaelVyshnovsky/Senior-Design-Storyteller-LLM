        "mainbody": "Kentrosaurus () was a species of dinosaur related to the Stegosaurus.\nKentrosaurus looked like its cousins dacentrurus and  stegosaurus. From its shoulder to the hip, a kentrosaur had large, bony plates along its back. From the hip until the end of its tail, it had large, sharp spikes. \nWhen attacked, kentrosaurus always positioned its body so their spikes were facing their opponent. It was capable of delivering significant damage with its spiked tail.\nKentrosaurs were most often encountered in jungles. \nKentrosaurs were herbivores and lived in herds."
