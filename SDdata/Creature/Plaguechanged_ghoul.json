        "mainbody": "'''Plaguechanged ghouls''' were [[ghoul]]-like [[undead]] creatures which were created when a [[humanoid]] was killed and then reanimated and twisted by the energies of the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Description": "While largely similar to ordinary ghouls in general appearance and mannerism, plaguechanged ghouls were immediately recognizable by the large, toothy maw in their stomach area, which glowed with blue fire.",
        "Behavior": "Plaguechanged ghouls appeared to exist in a state closer to life than an ordinary ghoul. They were able to speak [[Common]] and some also showed recognition of and a hesitancy to harm anyone with whom they might have empathized in life. However, in all other cases they hungered for flesh like any ghoul, although they avoided eating anything that was [[plaguechanged]] or any individual who was [[spellscarred]]. They had a mild affinity for creatures with [[magic]]al abilities.",
        "Abilities": "As undead, plaguechanged ghouls were immune to [[disease]] and resistant to [[Necromancy|necrotic]] energies. They were also resistant to the impact of magical [[force]], and did not share ordinary ghouls' sensitivity to [[radiant energy]].",
        "Combat": "Plaguechanged ghouls were frenzied and beast-like combatants who rushed into close combat. They attacked in packs, quickly surrounding their prey and pushing them info the waiting claws and maws of their packmates. Their claws and teeth were infused with the power of the Spellplague, allowing them to strike with magical force.\n\nAttempting to bite into a victim with the maw in its gut was an awkward maneuver in combat, and left a plaguechanged ghoul vulnerable to a counterattack. However, attackers had to be wary for the ghouls were much more adept at biting an enemy who had just tried and failed to hit them.",
        "Ecology": "Any area that had been ravaged by the Spellplague ran the risk of being home to a plaguechanged ghoul, although they tended to be found in more remote areas. They were also present in [[plagueland]]s\n\nPlaguechanged ghouls would sometimes cooperate with other undead or even with living humanoids. [[Sharn]]s had a mysterious sway over them, but otherwise they showed no affinity for any extraplanar powers.",
        "History": "Plaguechanged ghouls arose following the Spellplague of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, when some of the victims of the Plague's indiscriminate killing were raised by its energies. This included many of the faithful of [[Helm]] at [[Helm's Hold]], and even decades later, these ghouls remained hesitant to attack any who wore the sigil of their god.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], new plaguechanged ghouls could still arise in plaguelands. During this time, the [[Order of Blue Flame]] had found a way to turn the ghouls into their minions by taming them with food and shelter.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, both the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] also made use of plaguechanged ghoul minions.\n\nIt was said that [[Orcus]] aspired to gain influence over plaguechanged ghouls."
