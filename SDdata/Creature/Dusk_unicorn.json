Additionally, a dusk unicorn possessed a further two unusual magical abilities they could manifest a group of dancing lights that drew other creatures towards the light, and they could teleport themselves or a group of allies up to .\nDusk unicorns wielded their hooves and their horn as weapons in particular, charging into an enemy horn-first was an effective tactic of theirs."
