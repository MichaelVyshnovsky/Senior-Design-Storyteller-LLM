'''Bloodmarrow skeletons''' were a type of [[undead]] creature created by the unholy [[slayer]] of [[Bhaal]].

==Description==
Bloodmarrow skeleton were [[humanoid]] [[skeleton]]s, perpetually covered in fresh blood.

==Abilities==
These creatures could be created via a dead body being reanimated by a [[slayer]]. Bloodmarrow skeletons emerged from inside corpses. Despite being semi-intelligent creatures, they followed the slayer's commands and could not verbally communicate. They were immune to all [[poison]]s and venerable to bludgeoning weapons. In combat, bloodmarrow skeletons attacked their enemies in mêlée, trying to grab and slam their opponents, leaving bleeding wounds in the process.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Orin the Red]], daughter of [[Sarevok Anchev]], fought for the title of the [[Chosen]] of Bhaal. When she confronted the group of heroes known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]], her blood raged, transforming her into a monstrous slayer of Bhaal, an ability given to all [[Bhaalspawn]] children of the deity if they fed the bloodthirstiness in their blood. Bloodmarrow skeletons were created by the slayer out of the bodies of the slain [[Bhaalist]]s in the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|Temple of Bhaal]] underneath [[Baldur's Gate]].
