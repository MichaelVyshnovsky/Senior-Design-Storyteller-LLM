        "mainbody": "The archdevils were powerful, unique devils. The most powerful archdevils were the Lords of the Nine.\nThe position of archdevils in the hierarchy of Baator was clear archdevils were the most powerful and were, therefore, on top. The most powerful of the archdevils were the archdukes, also called the Lords of the Nine. Other archdevils were dukes, ruling portions of a layer, generals, or bureaucrats of various sorts. Each used the unique qualities of their layer to keep its essential nature pure of chaos.\nThe presence of an archdevil twists and warps the layer over which they rule to be closer to what they themselves embody.\n* Zariel The Lord of the First and commander of the diabolical armies in the Blood War, Zariel was a fallen angel who had been appointed to her archdukedom by Asmodeus himself.\n* Bel A general under the command of Zariel and a former archduke himself.\n* Qirozz A tactician under the command of Bel and later Zariel.\n* Under Tiamats rule of Avernus, her generals included the archdevils Amduscias and Malphas.\nthumb|right|Dispater, Lord of Dis.\n* Dispater The Lord of the Second, Dispater rarely left his Iron Tower due to his extreme paranoia.\n* Lilis The loyal consort of Dispater.\n* Titivilus Although not very powerful personally, Titivilus was Dispaters closest adviser.\n* Bitru A duke of Dis in the service of Dispater.\n* Arioch A vassal of Dispater who meted out vengeance on those who dared defy his master.\n* Biffant The loyal provost of Dispater.\n* Merodach A duke of Dis.\n* Alocer A duke of Dis.\n* Mammon The ruler of Minauros and patron of greed.\n* Glwa Mammons consort after Glasya left him.\n* Bael A powerful general in the service of Mammon.\n* Focalor The cautious seneschal of Mammon.\n* Caarcrinolaas A duke of Minauros.\n* Melchon A duke of Minauros.\nthumb|right|Belial and Fierna, Lords of Phlegethos.\n* Fierna The official Lord of the Fourth.\n* Belial The father of Fierna as well as her predecessor, Belial was in part the power behind the throne of Phlegethos.\n* Chamo An archdevil who served Belial as Legate of Abriymoch\n* Balan A duke of Phelgethos who served Belial he remained loyal to Belial even after the archduke \"retired\".\n* Bathym A duke of Phlegethos who served Belial he chose to cast his lot in with Fierna after she rose to power.\n* Gaziel A duke of Phlegethos who served Belial he remained loyal to Belial even after the archduke \"retired\".\n* Levistus The Lord of the Fifth was imprisoned in an iceberg by Asmodeus for past crimes.
