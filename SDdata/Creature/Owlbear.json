Notoriously aggressive and ferocious, they were among the most feared predators in the wilderness.\n{{quote|Once the wolves and owlbears catch your scent, they'll follow you. If you can't keep ahead of them, they'll eat you. Slowly, if it's an owlbear that catches you. They like cruel sport with their food.|[[Florin Falconhand]]}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Owlbears were monstrous beasts with the bodies of bears covered in thick shaggy coats of both bristly fur and feathers, ranging in coloration from yellowish brown to a brownish black. with limpid pupils and rimmed in red. and had a yellow to dull ivory hue. Those who'd had run-ins with them and lived often described bestial insanity in its eyes. A little larger and heavier than females, a fully grown male specimen stood {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} high and weighed {{SIrange|1300|1500|lb|k|long=yes}}, had {{SIAdj|2|in|c|long=yes|adj|long}} claws, and darker coats than females.\n\n[[File:Owlbear AFR.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''An owlbear (side view).'']]\nOther traits were less obvious but still significant. An owlbear could rotate its forearms as a [[human]] could, granting it greater strength and agility than a regular bear, giving it a wider range of attack, and enabling it to 'hug' and grapple prey. Moreover, while it had forward-facing eyes like both bears and owls, it also could rotate its head up to 270°, owing to it having fourteen neckbones (humans had seven and could only turn through 180°), and it could whip its head around with shocking speed. They had a transparent third eyelid (known as a nictitating membrane) to guard against dust, dirt, and bright light. Unusually, an owlbear's ears were asymmetric, with one somewhat higher than the other, letting it exactly locate the origin of any sound. Finally, owlbears had the same long tongues as bears, so it could lap up liquids the same way.{{Cite dragon/214/The Ecology of the Owlbear|86-88,90,92}} They could be surrounded by a pungent stink.",
        "Behavior": "Little more intelligent than most animals, They hunted so heavily because of their insatiable appetites, more than that of a giant owl and a bear combined. A hungry owlbear feared nothing, not even superior strength and size or any other discouragement or obstacle or impediment, and with little instinct for self-preservation, they would fight to the death. Only one that had already fed well was disinclined to attack a superior foe or risk its life.<ref> However, an owlbear's ferocity was also its key weakness—they could be easily lured into a trap or tricked into charging off a cliff, if available.\n\nOwlbears could be either diurnal or nocturnal, according to the habits of the local prey. Owlbears hibernated through the cold season and were most active in summer.\n\nOwlbears communicated via hooting and screeching, at high volume and with a range of pitches and durations.\n\n[[File:Owlbear SoG.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''An owlbear's eating habits are not particularly pleasant.'']]\nOwlbears were entirely carnivorous. When an owlbear successfully caught its prey, it tended to consume part of it on the spot, before dragging the rest back to its lair to be stored, with parts of the carcass stashed amongst or hanging on rocks, bushes, and trees. An owlbear would also scavenge a carcass.<ref> Owlbears tore their prey into chunks and swallowed these whole as owls did. Moreover, in the stomach, the flesh was digested, while bones, fur, feathers, and insect shells were churned into pellets and regurgitated; these tended to indicate an owlbear lair was close by. The sole exception to their carnivorous diet was a liking for [[honey]], which they inherited from regular bears. They could lap it up with their thick tongues and their thick coats protected them from angry [[bee]]s. A jar of honey was effective bait for owlbear hunters.",
        "Abilities": "An owlbear naturally had a bear's keen sense of scent that it could use to track prey as well as an owl's sharp eyesight for finding prey in the dark, with specimens even reported to possess [[low-light vision]], [[infravision]], or [[darkvision]]. They also had acute hearing able to locate a sound with pinpoint accuracy. As a result, it was nigh impossible to sneak past an owlbear, let alone sneak up on one, and they were not hampered by complete [[darkness]] or against [[invisibility|invisible]] foes. Their nictitating membranes also protected their sensitive eyes from blinding lights.\n\nDespite their unnatural origins, owlbears possessed no supernatural powers, though their calls were magical in nature. Different subspecies of owlbear had different calls, and these could have different magical effects.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Races of Faerun - Strongheart Halflings - Dennis Calero.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A [[strongheart halfling]] preventing an attack by an owlbear by blocking its beak.'']]\nAn owlbear fought with both its beak and its claws. They would try to slash and grab prey with one or both their claws, crush it in a bear-hug, and bite it and rend it in twain. While in a bear-hug, an owlbear often could not use its claws, and so favored biting with its beak and using its brute strength to crush its victim. In a fight, they simply targeted whatever was closest.\n\nIf wounded in a fight, they were known to screech so loudly it stunned nearby creatures, which the owlbear would then seize advantage of. Even at the point of death, an owlbear would fight as vigorously as it would when healthy.\n\nOwlbears were poor at climbing trees, owing to their large size and weight. But a victim who fled up a tree was not necessarily in the clear—the owlbear would simply wait under the tree or even knock it over if possible.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Cormanthor Owlbears": "The owlbears of the starwood area of Cormanthor developed a unique approach to finding food: farming insects. They had quickly eaten through their food supply of [[wolves]], rabbits, and snakes, and as food became scarce, their population began to decrease. Then, in the late 1350s DR, while hunting in the central starwood, one pack came across a pit holding a felled, rotting [[oak]] tree infested by [[giant harvester termite]]s, which they threw rocks at, picked out with sticks, and ate, finding that they were edible and tasty albeit not very filling. They returned a month later, finding thousands of termite larvae. The owlbears threw in additional decayed branches and damp leaves, watched the termite larvae eat the wood, and then ate them by the handful. Over some [[tenday]]s of this, the owlbears learned how to grow and maintain the termite colony by managing the wood supply and therefore effectively grew their own food. They did however have to kill the fire-spitting soldier termites the moment they hatched.\n\nIn time, the owlbears even established new termite colonies by digging pits and stocking them with wood and adult harvester termites. Other packs acquired the skill and before long the whole owlbear population of the starwood was farming termites. The owlbears favored crushing adult termites, eaten their soft insides, and throwing the shells. As a coincidental side effect of this practice, [[horse]]s were strongly attracted to the scent of decaying termite shells mixed with owlbear saliva. The owlbears took to hiding and waiting for horses to arrive, before pushing them into a termite pit and then devouring them, and any riders they happened to have. These new food sources arrested their decline and their numbers were steadily growing again by [[1367 DR]].\n\n[[Pyrolisk]]s were also drawn to the termite pits, but even owlbears would abandon a pit if a pyrolisk turned up, rather than be incinerated, however begrudgingly. The pyrolisks used the pits as their nests and their hatchlings fed on the termite larvae.",

            "Trade": "[[File:Owlbear Cub CLB.jpg|thumb|250px|''Remember: an owlbear is for life, not just for Midsummer.'']]\nAn owlbear egg could be sold for 200 to 2,000 gp and a hatchling or young owlbear could be sold for 500 to 3,000–5,000 gp in civilized places where the market existed for them.<ref>{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|21}} Wizards were the main buyers, for use as guardian creatures.

            "Training": "[[File:Taming owlbear.png|thumb|250px|''An owlbear being tamed for the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch of Waterdeep]]. Don't feel sorry for it.'']]\nOwlbears were impossible to domesticate and very difficult to tame, but they could be charmed or trained to a degree, through food (raw meat was preferred Professional trainers demanded 2,000 [[gp]] to rear or train one owlbear. A rare few individuals were 'owlbear whisperers', who could somehow placate an owlbear and even persuade it to follow them as a companion or guardian, at least so long as it was fed.<ref>\n\nWhatever method was used, an owlbear could learn to know and obey a master and serve as a guardian or mount. One raised from a chick could become quite loyal to a trainer, but to anyone else they would remain surly at best. Owlbears did not need to be trained to attack, as they did that regardless, and they were considered not much good for other tasks, which they performed quite begrudgingly. If ordered ''not'' to attack, they could well ignore their master and attack anyway. They could protect a master to a point, by attacking those who attacked their masters, and they could be trained to make even louder, thunderous shrieks that could bowl enemies over or distinct alert noises when fighting non-owlbears.\n\nTrained owlbears were typically used as free-ranging guardians in enclosed or strategic areas, which they saw as their territory. They tirelessly chased after all trespassers and fresh meat would be thrown to them as needed. Owlbear guardians were described as like 'keep out' signs but not as subtle. Owlbears found in ruins or dungeons had most likely been placed there as guardians. [[Gray orc]] tribes kept such creatures as owlbears as tribal guardians.<ref>\n\n[[File:Owlbear_Mount_from_Neverwinter_MMO.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Brave ''and'' foolish.'']]\nOwlbear mounts were ridden only by the brave, the foolish, or both. As such owlbears had often been beaten, they would struggle against their riders when they saw them seriously injured or weakened in battle, try to throw the rider out of the saddle, and then savage them with no thought for any other foe. Only a highly skilled rider can keep control of an owlbear.\n\n[[Elf|Elven]] treetop communities could sometimes encourage owlbears to lair under their homes, so that they served as a defense at night. [[Hobgoblin]]s might employ them as war beasts and [[hill giant]]s and [[frost giant]]s would have them as pets. In some frontier lands, owlbears might be trained for racing, with bets made on both which would win and which would savage its handler. Some gladiatorial arenas could keep starved owlbears for especially savage opponents, such as the [[Arena (Zhentil Keep)|Arena]] of [[Zhentil Keep]].<ref> The [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] were known to lure owlbears to border regions to assault human settlements.<ref>\n\nThe [[banshee]] [[Agatha]] ''charmed'' owlbears to build traps around [[Agatha's Grove|her grove]].<ref><ref>",
