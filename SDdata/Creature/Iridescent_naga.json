        "mainbody": "'''Iridescent nagas''' were a largely peaceful species of [[naga]] that spent their lives wandering the world seeking hidden beauty and new discoveries, and often explored ancient, overgrown ruins. Like other nagas, they were counted amongst the [[serpentfolk]].<ref>",
        "Description": "Like all nagas, iridescent nagas had snake-like bodies and human-like faces. Adults were typically {{SIrange|10|20|ft|long=yes}} in length, and weighed {{SIrange|200|500|lb|long=yes}} Iridescent nagas possessed prism-like scales that made them appear to be many colors. They had feathers on the head in place of hair that were also brightly colored, and had a silver frill of feathers that ran down the spine.",
        "Personality": "Iridescent nagas were highly intelligent and independent, but were ultimately good-hearted creatures.",
        "Abilities": "Iridescent nagas had several natural abilities, including a venom that could put people to sleep for up to 8 minutes. They could also [[hypnotism|hypnotize]] any creatures within {{SI|30|ft}} of themselves by simply swaying in place. Additionally, they themselves were immune to all mind-influencing effects.\n\nLike other nagas, iridescent nagas possessed a natural understanding of magic, and most were [[sorcerer]]s of at least moderate power. They typically knew the cantrips ''[[daze]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[mage hand]]'', ''[[message]]'', ''[[open/close]]'', and ''[[read magic]]'', and the spells ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[expeditious retreat]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[shield]]'', ''[[eagle's splendor]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[scorching ray]]'', ''[[fly]]'', and ''[[lightning bolt]]''.",
        "Combat": "Iridescent nagas preferred to avoid fighting, but if combat broke out then they sought high ground from which they could use their hypnotism and spells.",
        "Society": "Iridescent nagas preferred to live in temperate forests. On Toril, they were known to live in the deeper areas of the [[Chondalwood]], near the headwaters of the [[Nagaflow]] river.\n\nLike all nagas, they worshiped [[Shekinester]], in particular her guise as the Seeker.<ref>",
        "History": "Iridescent nagas were one of the five major naga species that formed after the fall of [[Mhairshaulk]].<ref>\n\nAround {{Yearlink|1373}},<ref> increasing numbers of iridescent nagas were traveling to the southern regions of [[Cormanthyr]] to challenge the [[Cult of the Dark Naga]], and to the jungles of [[Chult]] to fight the [[spirit naga]]s of the [[Chultengar]]."
