        "mainbody": "Vampiric mind flayers, also known as vampiric illithids, were created when an illithid tadpole infected with vampirism entered a humanoid. They could not create spawn and needed both fresh blood (or other bodily liquids such as cerebrospinal fluid) and fresh brains to survive. Vampiric mind flayers were found in Bluetspur after the God-Brain, an elder brain ruling the area, was infected with vampirism, along with its tadpoles.\nVampiric illithids were feral and were barely intelligent, and their telepathy did not work like other mind flayers. It only showed nearby creatures the mind flayers emotions through visceral images, and the telepathic abilities that came with it were almost, if not completely, useless. Their only major psionic ability was a blast of psychic energy that incapacitated foes near them.\nA vampiric mind flayer served its ruler by drinking the intelligence of humanoids and returning to the elder brain. Upon its return, its body would be liquified into a sort of balm that slowed the elder brains illness.\nVampiric illithids were hated and feared by normal illithids, who were disgusted by their lack of intelligence and free will and sole desire to serve the elder brain."
