'''Aquatic dwarves''', also known by the humorous name '''artesians''', were a water-dwelling offshoot of [[dwarf|dwarves]].

==Description==
Compared to other dwarves, aquatic dwarves had a muscular but slender build. Their skin color was a greenish tint of brown, and their hair was black or a grayish green. Typically hidden beneath their characteristic long, ungroomed beards were the gills that allowed them to breathe underwater.

===Relations===
Aquatic dwarves held particular enmity for [[sahuagin]], [[koalinth]]s, and [[merrow (ogre)|merrow]], and many made a point to learn the languages of the latter two races.

Some aquatic dwarf cities used [[sea lion]]s as guard animals.

Aquatic dwarves were almost entirely unknown to land-dwellers, and those sages that did know of them almost always considered them to be a myth. They were long fabled to be found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], but every scholar that looked into the manner conclusively discredited this rumor.<ref>

==History==
How aquatic dwarves originated was unknown to sages, though it was generally accepted that magic played a part in their origin, and those land-dwelling dwarves that knew of their aquatic cousins widely held that it was the result of a terrible curse.

After discussions with the [[Dwarfbilt Construction Company]] to build an underwater restaurant off the coast of [[Ravens Bluff]] fell through, the [[merman]] [[Slaythis J'harja]] pursued contact with the aquatic dwarves after hearing legends about them from one of the company's employees. With the help of a group of friendly [[triton]]s familiar with the aquatic dwarves, he was able to find them, and after a peace offering of precious [[gem]]s and his assistance in battling a [[sahuagin]] ambush, some of the dwarves were willing to assist in building [[Sharkey's Bar & Grill]].

==Notable Aquatic Dwarves==
The aquatic dwarf [[Lothan]] was employed as a cook at [[Sharkey's Bar & Grill]].
