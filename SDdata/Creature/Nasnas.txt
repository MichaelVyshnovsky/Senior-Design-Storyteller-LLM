Nasnas were humanoid creatures created by evil priests or wizards in Zakhara. They were fanatically loyal to their creator and would defend them to the death.
These creatures were literally half-humanoid, possessing only a single arm and leg and half a face and torso. 
Their skin had a gray tint and their eyes sparkled with insanity. 
Nasnas hopped about on their single leg when they moved. Some nasnas had a small wing, though it did not make them capable of flight.
Their wilds hoots and screams could cause panic in their foes or paralyze them with fear. 
They could only be harmed with weapons that were enchanted or made of iron.
Nasnas used weapons and wore armor. Their single arm was incredibly strong, adding ferocity to their attacks. 
Nasnas lived short lives, often killing themselves before the age of thirty.
Their only purpose in life was to protect their creator.
These creatures served as guardians in the strongholds of evil priests or wizards.
To create a nasnas a special potion was brewed that included a drop of the creatorâ€™s blood. The potion was injected into a piece of fruit which was sliced in half. If a woman ate the fruit she would conceive a nasnas and give birth nine months later. The creator would then arrive to claim the nasnas.
