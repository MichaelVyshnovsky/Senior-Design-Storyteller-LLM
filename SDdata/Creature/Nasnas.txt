}}'''Nasnas''' were [[humanoid]] creatures created by evil [[priest]]s or [[wizard]]s in [[Zakhara]]. They were fanatically loyal to their creator and would defend them to the death.

==Description==
These creatures were literally half-humanoid, possessing only a single arm and leg and half a face and torso. 

Their skin had a gray tint and their eyes sparkled with insanity. 

Nasnas hopped about on their single leg when they moved. Some nasnas had a small wing, though it did not make them capable of flight.

==Abilities==
Their wilds hoots and screams could cause panic in their foes or paralyze them with fear. 

They could only be harmed with weapons that were [[item enchantment|enchanted]] or made of [[iron]].

==Combat==
Nasnas used weapons and wore armor. Their single arm was incredibly strong, adding ferocity to their attacks. 

==Society==
Nasnas lived short lives, often killing themselves before the age of thirty.

Their only purpose in life was to protect their creator.
===Relationships===
These creatures served as guardians in the strongholds of evil priests or wizards.

To create a nasnas a special potion was brewed that included a drop of the creatorâ€™s blood. The potion was injected into a piece of fruit which was sliced in half. If a woman ate the fruit she would conceive a nasnas and give birth nine months later. The creator would then arrive to claim the nasnas.
