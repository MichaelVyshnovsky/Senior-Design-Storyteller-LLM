A '''brontosaurus''' ({{Pronounce|bran|to|SAR|us|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}|audio=Brontosaurus.ogg}}), also known as '''Thunderbeast'''{{Cite book/Son of Thunder
|}}, was a massive quadruped [[dinosaur]].

==Description==
Brontosauruses were so large that most predators did not dare attack them.

==Behavior==
These animals were not aggressive. They calmly lumbered through the jungles ignoring smaller creatures.

==Combat==
Brontosauruses only fought in self-defense. If necessary, they could stomp enemies and hit them with their enormous tails, which were powerful enough to even kill smaller predators.

==Ecology==
Brontosauruses were common to the jungles of [[Chult]], near swamp areas and rivers.
