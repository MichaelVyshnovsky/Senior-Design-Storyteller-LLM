        "Description": "[[File:Bronze dragon anatomy - Richard Sardinha.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''A review of bronze dragon anatomy.'']]\nWhile most of its body was a reflective bronze color, the wings were often tipped with green. The dragon had four large horns on each side of their heads, three protruding from each cheek and one from the top of their head, pointing back towards the tail. A large frill ran down the upper part of its neck.\n\nBronze dragons smelled like sea spray.\n\nA dragon egg could be identified as belonging to a bronze by the gold flecks seen when held in front of an intense white light, though it shared this trait with [[copper dragon]]sâ€”the former had fewer, bigger spots, while the latter had many tiny spots.<ref>",

            "Breath Weapon": "Bronze dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of electricity similar to a ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and the second was either a cone of gas that affected the minds of creatures caught in it, causing them to flee for a short time, or a cone of repulsion energy which physically pushed enemies away."

            "Lair": "Bronze dragons were often found along the coastal regions of the world. They liked to dwell along the sea, to make use of their aquatic abilities. Given its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair was quite naturally underwater. The bulk of the lair was above water level.",
            "Diet": "Bronze dragons, as with some other dragon breeds, were unable to chew their food. Hence, to aid digestion, they swallowed small stones, pieces of metal, and even coins, which went into a small second stomach like a bird's gizzard. These [[Wikipedia:gastrolith|stomach stones]] ground down their food and were eventually expelled in waste.<ref>{{Cite dragon/134/The Ecology of the Red Dragon|36}}",
            "Parenting and development": "[[File:bronze dragon wyrmling-5e.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|''A bronze dragon wyrmling.'']]\nBronze dragons mated for life, and took their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness.\n\nA newly-hatched bronze wyrmling appeared yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales gradually shifted to bronze as it matured."
