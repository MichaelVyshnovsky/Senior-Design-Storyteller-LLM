        "mainbody": "Ropers were ambush hunters that evolved in the underworld.\nThey took the appearance of stalagmites and would wait for a living creature to draw close.\nWhen this happened, the roper quickly lashed out with tendrils extruded from its body that wrapped around its target, sapping the creatures strength. The roper then drew its prey into its fang-filled mouth to consume. As a roper never knew when its next meal was coming, it often slew and ate more than it could possibly consume at once.\nThe larval forms of ropers were called piercers, (not to be confused with the mollusks of the same name and similar behaviors.)"
