The \"Deity Do's and Don't's\" web enhancement for ''Faiths and Pantheons'' changes this to \"red doves\", supporting this.\n\nThey were also commonly seen as [[familiar]]s of [[con-tinh]].",
        "Usages": "Doves were sometimes plucked, roasted, and eaten, with roasted dove served in the kitchens of [[Halarahh]] in [[Halruaa]]{{Cite web/My Slice of Silverymoon/Part 2}}\n\nIn certain auguries, the future was [[divination|divined]] from the random flight patterns of wild birds such as doves. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Procopio Septus]], the Lord Mayor of [[Halarahh]] and a [[diviner]], devised a way to read the future in flights of doves magically lured to a dovecote in his kitchen for subsequent culinary use. This had two benefits as he enjoyed roasted dove."
