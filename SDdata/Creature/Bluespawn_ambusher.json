        "mainbody": "'''Bluespawn ambushers''' were a breed of [[dragonspawn]]. They were dangerous hunters and sentinels who burrowed in order to surprise their victims.",
        "Description": "Bluespawn ambushers were heavily muscled creatures, said to be similar in shape to a badger (albeit much larger), with blue scales and a single forward-pointing horn on their head. Ambushers stood about {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder, and were {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} long and nearly as wide. They weighed about {{SI|350|lb|k|long=yes}}. Females were distinguishable by their slightly narrower heads and longer horns. Young ambushers had light blue scales, while older ones had darker blue scales. The very oldest ambushers would have scales lined with black.",
        "Personality": "Bluespawn ambushers were dim-witted, little more than beasts, but enough so that they could strategize in fights- and serve [[Tiamat]] and her worshipers.",
        "Abilities": "Bluespawn ambushers were valued as guards for their tremorsense, and they were just intelligent enough to understand and speak the [[Draconic language]]. Beyond that, their were naturally immune to electricity and could blast a burst of the energy at a creature within {{SI|10|ft}}.",
        "Combat": "Bluespawn ambushers hunted by burrowing below the surface of the ground and waiting for a creature to come close. When they sensed potential prey, they would burst out of the ground and use their electrical blast ability. If the victim survived the first such attack, they would burrow again and pursue (if it fled) and repeat as needed. If this strategy could not be used, then bluespawn ambushers relied on their claws and fangs instead. They would flee if severely injured, unless commanded to fight to the death by an evil [[dragon]] or a follower of Tiamat.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Homelands": "Bluespawn ambushers could theoretically be found anywhere that [[blue dragon]]s lived, but most of the population in [[Faerun]] lived in [[Unther]]. Several packs there served a hobgoblin worshiper of Tiamat named [[Hurthoogul]]."
