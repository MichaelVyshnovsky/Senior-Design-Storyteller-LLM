Some giant maggots had several appendages growing from their body, causing them to resemble a hideous caterpillar.\nGiant maggots were immune to all mind-affecting effects and spells.\nGiant maggots avoided combat, only attacking a creature in self-defense. If a giant maggot was starving, they became predatory and attacked nearby creatures.\nSeveral giant insect species laid their eggs on or near the decaying corpse of a large creature or a large pile of dung, upon which the giant maggots fed.
