        "mainbody": "Giant maggots were the larval stage for several giant insect species.\nGiant maggots looked like their smaller cousins. Some giant maggots had several appendages growing from their body, causing them to resemble a hideous caterpillar.\nGiant maggots were immune to all mind-affecting effects and spells.\nGiant maggots avoided combat, only attacking a creature in self-defense. If a giant maggot was starving, they became predatory and attacked nearby creatures.\nSeveral giant insect species laid their eggs on or near the decaying corpse of a large creature or a large pile of dung, upon which the giant maggots fed. When they hatched, giant maggots were  in length. They continued to grow for several weeks until reaching a maximum length of about . Shortly after, the giant maggot metamorphosed into an adult giant insect."
