        "Description": {
            "Etymology": "Depending on their region and fur coloration, tabaxi were known by different names. Tabaxi with solid spots were sometimes called '''leopard-folk''' and tabaxi with [[wikipedia:Rosette_(zoology)|rosette]] spots were called '''jaguar-folk'''.\n\nThe way the tabaxi pronounced their own name also varied; the \"leopard-folk\" pronounced it ''ta-BÆK-see'', and the jaguar-folk ''tah-BAHSH-ee''."
        },
        "Personality": "Tabaxi were a reclusive people who often avoided interaction with other intelligent races. However, as each tabaxi possessed a specific feline trait, some had an innate curiosity that compelled them to travel and seek out stories, artifacts, new experiences and knowledge, never remaining in the same place or obsessing over the same piece of lore for too long.\n\nIn general, tabaxi did not care for wealth, but they had an almost obsessive interest in ancient artifacts, relics and magic items, not for the items themselves as much as the stories and secrets they held. Once an item had been thoroughly examined and studied, and its secrets revealed, it would lose its allure and the tabaxi would quickly lose interest and pass it on.\n\nNot all tabaxi were motivated by curiosity to leave their homeland, however. Some found safer ways to satisfy their fleeting obsessions by becoming traveling minstrels and tinkers, often accepting interesting objects and stories as payment for their services.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Tabaxi Toucaneers CLB.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Tabaxi riding atop giant [[toucan]] aerial mounts.]]\nTabaxi were exceptional hunters and utilized these skills in combat. Speed and stealth combined with their natural [[wikipedia:Camouflage|camouflage]] meant that tabaxi were particularity skilled at surprise attacks.{{Cite dragon/127/In the Heat of the Fight|47}}\n\nFor weapons, tabaxi favored [[bolas]], [[sling]]s, [[maca]]s, and [[javelin]]s with [[wikipedia:Spear-thrower|atlatl]]. These weapons would often be made from wood, bone or stone. Tabaxi were just as likely to use weapons as they were to use their claws and teeth. Their preference of simple weapons was not due to a lack of capability. Tabaxi were quite capable of adapting to new technology or salvaged weapons.\n\nDue to their knowledge of hunting, intelligence and sense of smell, it was practically impossible to trap a tabaxi.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "The Tabaxi language was an ancient form of the [[Payit language]]. Those who spoke modern Payit and knew what to listen for could usually understand about half of the Tabaxi words they heard.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26,29}}",
            "Religion": "Most clans worshiped [[Tezca]], [[Nula]], or (rarely) [[Azul]]. A minority of clans owed their allegiance to a [[jaguar lord]]. In this instance, [[Zaltec]] was the dominant deity of the tribe.\n\nThe creator figure in the tabaxi pantheon was the [[Cat Lord]], a fickle and [[Trickery domain|tricky]] entity who bestowed each tabaxi with a specific feline trait and was believed to wander the world, watching over them.",
            "Interracial Relations": "Tabaxi had few enemies and only the most degenerate clans would attack members of other intelligent species without good reason.",
            "Threats": "Tabaxi were sometimes hunted for their pelts. Each pelt could be sold for up to 50 [[currency|gp]]. [[Hishna]] shapers could use tabaxi skin and claws to enhance their strength.{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|19-20}}"
        },
        "History": "Because of the black market and slave trade that brought them to Faerûn, some tabaxi made the jungles of Chult their home after escaping captivity. Tabaxi minstrels primarily lived in and around [[Port Nyanzaru]], but hunters roamed the entire peninsula.",
        "Notable Tabaxi": "[[File:Tabaxi_minstrel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A tabaxi [[bard|minstrel]]'']]\n*[[Birdsong]], a tabaxi bard from Chult.\n*[[Chioptl]], a tabaxi who led a group of warriors to [[Nexal]] to recover a legendary cloak.\n*[[River Mist]] and [[Flask of Wine]], two tabaxi siblings from Port Nyanzaru who offered their services as guides to the jungles of [[Chult]] in the late 15th century [[DR]].\n*[[Two Llamas Running]], a tabaxi [[swashbuckler]] from Maztica kept prisoner in [[Silverymoon]].{{Cite dragon+/12/The Barber of Silverymoon|10}}\n*The [[Velvet Veil]] tavern in [[Ashabenford]] was famous for a particularly talented tabaxi dancer."
