'''Megaraptor''' was a species of [[dinosaur]]s, larger and fiercer cousin of a [[deinonychus]] that shared their habitats and behavior.

==Description==
Megaraptors were large and lean bipedal dinosaurs with wicked-looking claws on their feet. Just like their smaller cousins, megaraptors' hides were bright, reminiscent of the tropical bird plumage in color. Usual hide colors included bright green, orange, or red along the back and flanks, with the lighter shade of the same color on the belly. Megaraptors' backs usually had dark spots or stripes. An average specimen stood {{SI|12'|'"|long=yes}} tall and could reach {{SI|24'|'"|long=yes}} in length.

==Abilities==
Even at an advanced age, or if blinded, megaraptors remained deadly predators, thanks to their extremely keen sense of smell.{{Cite dragon/341/Wormfood: Surviving the Age of Worms Adventure Path}}

==Behavior==
Megaraptors could be encountered as solitary hunters as well as packs of as many as six dinosaurs. Their brains were relatively big for a dinosaur, and they showed cunning and pack-hunting instincts. 

==Combat==
When attacking, megaraptors used their speed and strong legs to charge and pounce at their victims. When in melee rage, the dinosaurs used their sharp teeth, talons, and foreclaws.

==Ecology==

Megaraptors were known to inhabit the jungles of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] and in the [[Malatran Plateau]] of [[Kara-Tur]].

Similar to deinonychuses, megaraptors were trainable animals. [[Goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[troglodyte]]s were known to use them as mounts. However, they were a rare sight as megaraptors were hard to control. A living megaraptor egg could fetch a price of 13,000 [[gp]], while the cost of training of a single creature was valued at 2,000 gp.

There were known cases of successful megaraptor and [[red dragon]] breeding producing [[half-dragon]] mounts used by [[githyanki]]. Thankfully, such breeds were not known to exist on [[Toril]].{{Cite dragon/309/Incursion: A World Under Siege|94}}

Megaraptors could be magically summoned through the ''[[summon nature's ally VI]]'' [[spell]]{{Cite dragon/302/The Summoner's Circle|28}} and fiendish megaraptors â€“ via ''[[summon monster VII]]''. Magically reanimated megaraptors were known to be used to create [[revived fossil]]s, [[zombie]]s, and [[skeleton]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, megaraptors were a common threat to the [[gnome]]s operating the illegal logging operation a the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]''. One such beast made the engineers' lives complicated after it swallowed a mechanism essential to the ''portal's'' operation. The device was designed to remain functional even in the roughest of environments and could simply be extracted after the dinosaur's death.
