        "mainbody": "A '''deva''' ({{Pronounce|DEE|va|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was a kind of [[angel]], or aasimon.While 1{{st}}-, 2{{nd}}-, and 3{{rd}}-edition sources presented three subtypes of deva, the 5{{th}}-edition [[Monster Manual 5th edition|''Monster Manual'']] presents just a simple \"deva\", resembling the movanic deva, that combines a few traits of the previous three. Moreover, the astral deva [[Lumalia]] in ''[[Dead in Thay]]'' was changed to simply a deva in ''[[Tales from the Yawning Portal]]'', with the same statistics as the one in the ''Monster Manual'', greatly simplified from those in earlier editions. It's unclear if this represents a generic deva or summary of deva lore, or if the three orders have been somehow merged or erased in the century since 3{{rd}} edition (4{{th}} edition [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] being very different), or if a later source will restore this detail. The 5{{th}}-edition lore is included in this article.",
        "Description": "Devas appeared as [[human]]-like men and women{{Deva genders}} of extraordinary beauty or handsomeness with two magnificent feathered wings emerging from their shoulders.The appearances of devas have been switched with each edition. In 1st edition, in [[Dragon magazine 63|''Dragon'' #63]], monadic devas have a silvery-white coloration and muscular builds, while movanic devas have a coppery, rosy coloration. ''[[Monster Manual II 1st edition|Monster Manual II]]'' omits a description of the movanic deva. However, in 2nd edition, in ''[[Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix]]'', movanic devas have the silvery-white coloration and slender build, while monadic devas have muscular builds and a new dark coloration, while the coppery, rosy coloration is lost. In v.3.5, in [[Fiend Folio 3rd edition|''Fiend Folio'']], movanic devas are the same and monadic devas retain the dark coloration but are not explicitly given the muscular build. Astral devas, meanwhile, remain consistent through these sources, but artwork for ''[[Monster Manual v.3.5]]'' gives a dark coloration while not expressly describing hair or skin color in text. This article uses the consistent combined descriptions of the later 2nd- and 3.5-edition sources.\n\nDevas were averse to clothing; when they must adhere to mortal custom, they donned simple loincloths or other coverings.\n\nWhen a deva died, all parts of their body, what clothes they wore, their weapons, and their other possessions vanished completely, and thus none were ever examined closely.",
        "Personality": "Devas shared the devotion to goodness of the other angels. They were strong-willed and fearless.",
        "Society": "There were three varieties or orders of devas: the astral devas, the monadic devas, and the movanic devas.\n\nThey usually worked alone, but also operated in pairs, trios,",
        "Activities": "Devas were servants and messengers of the good gods, able to go wherever in the planes they were ordered. However, they often had to be proactive and deliver their messages at the points of their swords, and, indeed, preferred it. Thus, they were also mighty warriors in the battle against evil, wherever in the multiverse it appeared. ''[[summon monster]]'', ''[[gate]]'', or ''[[planar ally]]'' [[spell]]. Only rarely did they act on their own initiative, but when they did, it invariably involved righteous violence. Only astral devas were able to travel astrally. The devas could operate more-or-less equally well in any environment, even in water.\n\nEach order of devas had a different role in the grand scheme of the Upper Planes.\n\nThe privileged movanic devas traveled to the [[Prime Material Plane]] to aid prominent followers of the gods of good in times of great need. While they more often appeared disguised as [[humanoid]]s or [[animal]]s, they could manifest in their winged angelic form if this suited their needs.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, devas were sent as agents to the Material Plane, the [[Feywild]], and the [[Shadowfell]].\n\nWhatever realm or plane they were sent to, devas used their shapechanging powers to adopt a suitable guise, usually appearing to mortals as an unremarkable animal or humanoid. In particular, when at peace among mortals, movanic devas more often appeared in disguise as humanoids or animals, and rarely in their natural forms. There were legends of devas that spent years dwelling among mortals in disguise, helping and inspiring the good people around them.\n\nSome devas acted as angelic guides to mortal [[aasimar]], appearing to them in visions and offering wise direction.",
        "Homes": "Within the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the devas were known to dwell in the [[Upper Planes]], those [[Outer Planes]] that were aligned with good, namely [[Arborea]], [[Arcadia]], the [[Happy Hunting Grounds|Beastlands]], [[Bytopia]], [[Elysium]], [[Mount Celestia]], and [[Ysgard]], where a few dwelt.<ref>",
        "Relations": "[[File:Angels - Jeremy Jarvis.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''An astral deva (front) with a planetar (middle) and a solar (back).'']]\nThe devas served the gods of good as their proxies and served the cause of goodness itself.  They were far from the most powerful entities on the Upper Planes, but their might was not to be disregarded either.\n\nDevas of all kinds were known to serve the deities [[Azuth]], [[Ilmater]], and [[Mystra]], while movanic devas in particular served [[Deneir]], [[Lliira]], and [[Milil]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}\n\nThey served as the common soldiery in the armies of good in the eternal war against evil. They were a fundamental component of the forces of good, forming a reliable and strong vanguard of the Upper Planes, alongside the [[agathinon]]. They dwelled and worked in total harmony with the other beings of the Upper Planes, and had a close relationship with other aasimon, especially planetars. On occasion, when the need was great, a planetar would lead a band of devas on a mission for a good deity.",
        "Powers": "Devas possessed all the powers, protections, and traits common to the [[aasimon]]\n\nAll devas were initially reported to use the spells ''[[cure disease]]'' and ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' thrice a day; ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[detect traps]]'', and ''[[dispel magic]]'' each seven times a day; ''[[heal]]'' once a day; and ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect illusion]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[etherealness]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[invisibility, 10' radius]]'', ''[[light]]'' (varying with the kind of deva), ''[[protection from evil]]'' (varying with the deva), ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', ''[[remove fear]]'', ''[[teleport]]'' (without error), ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[ultravision]]'', as often as they willed. They also had a constant ''[[infravision]]'' in place. Later, this list was given as ''cure disease'' thrice a day; ''cure light wounds'', ''[[detect snares and pits]]'', and ''dispel magic'' each seven times a day; ''heal'' once a day; and ''[[detect lie]]'', ''invisibility, 10' radius'', ''light'', ''protection from evil'', ''remove curse'', ''remove fear'', and ''tongues'' as often as they willed. They also had a constant ''[[infravision]]'' in place.\n\nBefore and after 1358 DR, they were known to be all immune to injury from cold, electricity, gases, natural fire, non-magical weapons, and ''[[magic missile]]''. They could not be petrified or poisoned. Astral and movanic devas were resistant to magical fires, while monadic devas were completely immune.\n\nAll orders of deva had the power to change their own form at will, either through the spell ''[[polymorph self]]'',{{Cite web/Monster Manual v.3.5/Errata}} This last let them change form into a small or medium [[humanoid]] or into an animal. If killed, they reverted to their true form.\n\nWhen a deva died on the [[Prime Material plane]] or the [[Elemental planes]], all parts of their body, what clothes they wore, their weapons, and their other possessions vanished completely. Only their material body was destroyed, while their immortal spirit returned to their home plane. It took ten years to regain the power to manifest a corporeal form. If they died on any other plane, then they were destroyed utterly.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Deva NWN MMO.jpg|thumb|right|''An astral deva.'']]\nAlthough they might use many different weapons, each order of deva commonly wielded a specific weapon: a [[disruption|disrupting]] [[mace]] for the astral deva, a [[mace of smiting|smiting]] mace or rod for the monadic deva, and a flaming two-handed sword for the movanic deva. They had no need of any treasure or wealth, though might still carry useful items.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century, any weapon wielded by a deva was radiantly magical. They preferred very large maces,",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], a group of six astral and monadic devas, led by the deva [[Ariziel]], was dispatched to capture [[the Winged]], a [[dark planetar]] cast out from [[Celestia]] for failing [[Torm]]. The devas could not overcome the Winged, and found themselves captured in turn. They were turned into [[fallen deva]]s and forced to fight in the gladiatorial arena of the Winged's master, the [[Thay]]an [[wizard]] [[Dennaton]], where they eventually perished.",
        "Notable Devas": "[[File:Lumalia - Dead in Thay.jpg|thumb|right|''Lumalia, an astral deva servant of Mystra.'']]\n:''See [[:Category:Devas]]''\n* [[Lumalia]], a servant of Mystra held prisoner within the [[Doomvault]] for centuries.\n* [[Micus]] and [[Tauran]], high-ranking servants of [[Tyr]].\n* [[Eirwyn]], a servant of [[Helm]] and skilled [[diviner]].\n* The [[Sannyasi]], appointed by the Serene [[Abhirati]] to watch over her realm of [[Langdarma]] in the [[Yehimal Mountains]].
