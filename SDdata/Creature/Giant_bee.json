        "Description": "Giant bees could reach lengths of about {{SI|5|ft|c|long=yes}}.\n\nLike their tiny cousins, giant bees came in multiple varieties, including honeybees and [[Bee|bumblebees]]. Of the two, giant bumblebees were the larger species.",
        "Behavior": "[[File:Giant bee attack.png|right|thumb|280px|''A giant bee defends itself!'']]\nGiant bees were not ordinarily aggressive, unless they were acting in defense.",
        "Abilities": "Like normal-sized bees, a giant bee could inject a poison into another creature, but pulling away from the sting would result in the death of the giant bee. Giant bee venom weakened the general constitution of one stung, without harming the targets strength or agility. The venom of a giant bumblebee was stronger for giant soldier honeybees and giant bumblebees, and the poison from a queen was stronger still.\n\nGiant bees were very skilled at orienting themselves in their environment.",
        "Sub-Species": {
            "Upper Planes Giant Bee": "Giant bees that lived in the [[Upper Planes]] were [[celestial creature]]s, and more intelligent than normal giant bees. They served the [[good]]-aligned [[deities]],{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}} being particularly favored by the [[halfling]] goddess [[Sheela Peryroyl]], and were capable of being summoned for short periods of time by spellcasters with the [[spell]] ''[[Summon monster II]]''."

        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "They could be found in parts of [[Kara-Tur]].",
            "Usages": "Like smaller bees, giant bees produced [[honey]]. A chunk of honey known as \"bee bread\" was capable of providing daily nourishment for a typical [[humanoid]]. In rare cases, a variety known as \"royal jelly\" was found, which was said to have mild healing and curative properties and even the ability to slow aging! [[Jar]]s of this coveted unguent could cost between 3,000 and 8,000 [[gold piece]]s."
        },
        "Trivia": "* Magical ''[[Amber amulet of vermin|amber amulets of vermin]]'' were sometimes crafted on [[Toril]] that contained a small bee that would grow into a giant bee when the amulet was broken."
