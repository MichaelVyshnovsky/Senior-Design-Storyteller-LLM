        "mainbody": "arth mephits were mephits from the Elemental Plane of Earth.\nEarth mephits were roughly humanoid, winged creatures with a height of 4 feet (1.2 meters) and weighed 80 pounds (36.3 kilograms), though bigger specimens existed too.\nLike most mephits, earth mephits were curious rather than evil, but they could vary.\nEarth mephits had sharp claws, which they used in combat. These claws worked like magical weapons.\nEarth mephits had wings and could fly faster than their speed on land.\nThey had tough skin and healed when they were buried to their waist in earth or were underground.\nAn earth mephit could cast soften earth and stone and an effect similar to enlarge person on themselves each once per day. They could breath pebbles to hurt those within 15 feet (4.6 meters).\nEarth mephits could summon another earth mephit once per day for one hour, though this ability worked only one in four times.\nEarth mephits were encountered alone but also gathered with similar mephits in groups called gangs consisting of two to four mephits and mobs consisting of five to a dozen mephits.\nEarth mephits were also found as cohorts to charismatic individuals.\nThe drow god Vhaeraun was served by earth mephits, and they were sometimes sent by him to aid his followers."
