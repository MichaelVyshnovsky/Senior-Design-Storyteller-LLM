Half-oni were the offspring of an oni and another humanoid creature.
Male oni were known to sometimes take human females as brides.
When ogres and oni magi bred, the resulting half-oni eventually developed into a new race of ogrima.
Half-oni could also be produced through magical means, as occurred in the town of Kudoku, when the wu jen geisha Namiko Li began using dark rituals to transform herself and her servants into oni.
