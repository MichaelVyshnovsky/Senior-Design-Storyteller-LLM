        "mainbody": "spectral harpist was a type of ghost. They were created when the spirits of Master Harpers died whilst leaving Harper business unfinished.\nSpectral harpists were intelligent undead that resembled ghosts or wraiths, appearing as translucent, shadowy forms that floated or flew around. They retained the powers they possessed in life as a Master Harper, and could also speak and sing as they did in life, but lost the ability to cast spells and they could not gain new memories. \nThey were highly resistant to magic as well as to electricity- and cold-based spells, and in certain magicstrong areas (most Harper strongholds and refuges), spectral harpists could not be turned. Once each day, they could sing a haunting dirge known as a deathsong which instilled terror in all living creatures who could hear it.\nSpectral harpists innately possessed the ability to make magic items glow with white light.\n*Sylun√© Silverhand\nCategoryGhosts\nCategoryUndead\nCategoryCreatures with the incorporeal subtype\n35qttymvu13qa8ey5mynkblk0p0pxgo"
