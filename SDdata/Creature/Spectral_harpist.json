        "mainbody": "A '''spectral harpist''' was a type of [[ghost]]. They were created when the spirits of [[Master Harper]]s died whilst leaving [[Harper]] business unfinished.",
        "Description": "Spectral harpists were intelligent [[undead]] that resembled ghosts or [[wraith]]s, appearing as translucent, shadowy forms that floated or flew around. They retained the powers they possessed in life as a Master Harper, and could also speak and sing as they did in life, but lost the ability to cast spells and they could not gain new memories.",
        "Combat": "They were highly resistant to [[magic]] as well as to electricity- and cold-based [[spells]], and in certain magicstrong areas (most Harper strongholds and refuges), spectral harpists could not be turned. Once each day, they could sing a haunting dirge known as a ''[[deathsong]]'' which instilled terror in all living creatures who could hear it.\n\nSpectral harpists innately possessed the ability to make magic items glow with white light.",
