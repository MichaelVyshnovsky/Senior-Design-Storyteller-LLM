        "Description": "These creatures were larger than the average mundane crocodile. Most notably, a variety of vegetation grew on their backs.",
        "Abilities": "Feymire crocodiles exuded a magical aura that made the area around them more difficult for creatures to walk on, as though they were traversing a mire. They also possessed a sort of magical regenerative ability.\n\nThese creatures were capable of extending the vegetative roots and tendrils that grew on their backs into the ground, allowing them to draw nourishment from their environment.",
        "Combat": "These creatures fought with their large jaws, clamping them down on prey and attempting to swallow them whole.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Feymire crocodiles were primarily known to be a carnivorous species, though as detailed earlier they could draw nourishment from their environment.",
            "Habitats": "These creatures were native to the untamed marshlands of the Feywild, though they could occasionally be found in swamps on the [[Prime Material plane]].{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|65}}"
