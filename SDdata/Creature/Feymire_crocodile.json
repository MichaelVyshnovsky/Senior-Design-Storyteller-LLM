        "mainbody": "Feymire crocodiles were a variety of crocodile native to the swamps and marshes of the Feywild.\nThese creatures were larger than the average mundane crocodile. Most notably, a variety of vegetation grew on their backs.\nFeymire crocodiles exuded a magical aura that made the area around them more difficult for creatures to walk on, as though they were traversing a mire. They also possessed a sort of magical regenerative ability.\nThese creatures were capable of extending the vegetative roots and tendrils that grew on their backs into the ground, allowing them to draw nourishment from their environment.\nThese creatures fought with their large jaws, clamping them down on prey and attempting to swallow them whole.\nFeymire crocodiles were primarily known to be a carnivorous species, though as detailed earlier they could draw nourishment from their environment.\nThese creatures were native to the untamed marshlands of the Feywild, though they could occasionally be found in swamps on the Prime Material plane."
