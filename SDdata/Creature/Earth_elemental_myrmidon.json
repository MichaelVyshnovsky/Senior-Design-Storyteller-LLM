        "mainbody": "'''Earth elemental myrmidons''', otherwise known as '''earth myrmidons''' or '''earth archons''', were a variety of [[elemental myrmidon]], beings created by conjuring and bonding [[elemental]]s &mdash; in this case, of [[elemental earth]] &mdash; into ritually created suits of [[armor]] to act as servile weapons of war.{{MyrmidonArchon-Connection}}",
        "Description": "Earth myrmidons were beings composed entirely of elemental earth, with bodies that were roughly [[human]] in size and shape.\n\nLike all elemental myrmidons, they wore thick armor, typically of a [[plate mail|plate]] variety.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} Their armor was all that would remain of them when killed.",
        "Personality": "Even among the militarily minded myrmidons, earth myrmidons stood out as being excellent strategists. They preferred to conquests at a slow and steady pace, bunkering down and fortifying positions.",
        "Abilities": "Earth myrmidons were immune to the effects of [[disease]]s and [[poison]]s, as they were composed wholly of elemental essence.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|43}} \n\nAll varieties of earth myrmidon were capable of creating tremors in the earth, an innate ability they heavily utilized in combat. Seismic strikers had the unique ability to manifest stone [[javelin]]s that they hurled at their enemies. And ground ragers gave off an aura that liquified the earth around their enemies to impede their movements.",
        "Combat": "The standard variety of earth myrmidon, rumblers, typically fought with either mighty [[warhammer]]s or [[maul]]s made of stone. Those known as ground ragers fought with no weapons, while seismic strikers fought with a [[shield|heavy shield]], a [[war pick]], and their stone javelins. Regardless of what weapon they used, it was considered [[magic item|magical]] and could cause seismic shockwaves.",
        "History": "{{main|Elemental myrmidon#History}}\n\nIn late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], earth myrmidons could be found inhabiting [[Mount Hotenow]].\n\nDuring the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis, earth myrmidons and their variants were utilized by members of one of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis, the [[Cult of the Black Earth]].",
        "Varieties": {
            "Ground Rager": "The term used for a variety of earth myrmidon that, while seemingly weaker than rumblers, possessed a much wider array of seismic abilities. They were often drawn to regions of geologic activity, such as fault zones or volcanoes, and they wore [[chainmail]] instead of the standard plate.",
            "Rumblers": "The term used for the basic variety of earth myrmidon, who formed the foundation of many elemental armies.",
            "Seismic Strikers": "One of the more powerful varieties of earth myrmidons. They often served as shock troops within elemental armies, crushing enemies that were too slow in fleeing."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Creation": "Some said that constructing an elemental archon required a special foundry, with a special forge built in a significant concentration of elemental energy,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|42}} and a summoning crucible that served as the transformation space. These forges rarely appeared like a common forge, being unrecognizable contraptions of [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[elemental magic]].\n\nA working foundry could produce them as often as the ritual could be performed and for as long as the foundry's resources were maintained. The forge's power determine what kind of myrmidon was created.{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|44}} A forge with ebbing power could only generate the most basic of earth myrmidons, while those at high flow could produce other varieties,{{Cite dragon/361/Ecology of the Fire Archon|45}} such as ground ragers and seismic strikers.",
            "Relationships": "Many were known to serve [[Ogr√©moch]], the evil [[archomental]] of elemental earth.{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|25, 28}} Beyond this, seismic strikers sometimes acted as guards for [[stone giant]]s.\n\nAmong their fellow myrmidons, earth myrmidons worked better with [[ice archon]]s than [[fire archon|fire ones]], due to having similar approaches to warfare."
