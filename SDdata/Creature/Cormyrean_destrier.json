        "mainbody": "The Cormyrean destrier was an exceptionally well-bred type of heavy warhorse, sought after throughout all of Faer√ªn but particularly prized in the west and throughout the North. They were famously depicted in art from across the lands, especially in the tapestries of various palaces and keeps.\nDespite their popularity throughout the continent, the finest destriers were found from ranches outside the Cormyrean towns of Arabel and Waymoot. They could go for as much as 2,500 gp.\nThese imposing horses had a unique, raised nose and wide eyes that were full of expression.\nThese horses were originally bred by royal order of King Azoun I, from stocks of Nars and Tharur, around the year 400 DR."
