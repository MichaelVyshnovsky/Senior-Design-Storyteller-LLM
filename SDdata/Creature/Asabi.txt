Asabis, also known as laerti,
Asabi was the Bedine word for this creature The Bedine also called them "The Evil Ones Below." In the Common tongue, they were called "laerti," which had its origins in Netheril. "Laerti" was the term they called themselves.
Asabis stood about  tall on two legs. They had long tails. Their skin was thick and their scales were gray to brown color, and they had light green or dun undersides. They had narrow, sloping skulls. Their eyes were very large, egg-shaped, and yellow, and they had forked tongues. Their limbs projected out at sharp angles, making their movements awkward to typical humanoid observers however, they could move as easily on four limbs as two, balancing with their long tails.

They often served as mercenaries or slaves. They were nocturnal creatures, and as such were typically only ever encountered at night. Their body temperatures were not suited to the hot sun. If they stayed on the surface during the day, they had to bury themselves into the sand or hide in the rock crevices. 
Free asabi tribes were ruled by either a war leader or a council of elders.
There were two different subraces of asabi standard asabi and stingtail asabi, a larger and less intelligent variety. and stingtails always tagged along with asabi tribes.
Asabis only ate the soft tissue of their prey, leaving the rest to dry under the sun. They were omnivorous and also consumed fungi that grew in the desert caves they inhabited. A delicacy among the asabis were the taproots of oasis plants.
Asabis were found in deserts, particularly in the Anauroch. Asabis could also be found in the desert areas of Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden.
Asabis were created by the sarrukh and served them in Isstosseffifil in Oreme.
Many asabis served the phaerimm as slaves beneath the Anauroch. 
In the , asabi mercenaries allied with the Zhentarim, during their failed attempt to dominate trans-Anauroch trade. The combined Asabi and Zhentilar armies were thwarted by the Harper Lander, the sorceress Ruha, and the united Bedine tribes.
With the return of Thultanthar in the , the enslaved asabi were freed when the shadovar destroyed their phaerimm masters. Many of these asabi turned to illithids and beholders as new masters.
