        "mainbody": "Wild halflings were halflings native to the jungles of Far Payit in Maztica.\nWild halflings tended to be lean, and had black hair and dark eyes. They spoke their own language, and occasional some Payit as well.\nThe wild halflings lived in small tribes in the jungles of Far Payit, separate from the native humans. They had a primitive, hunter-gatherer society, and each tribe is ruled by a chief, who made decisions alone. They also practiced polygamy, with males being free to have as many wives as they could comfortably support. A male could challenge another male for a female.\nEach village was completely self-sufficient, and the halflings had no use for trade. Their tendency to kill humans they found in their territory meant that they rarely had visitors.\nWild halflings made a unique, paralyzing poison called kurari which they used on their arrows for hunting and fighting. In addition, they would use knives to dispatch prey and to defend themselves.\nThe wild halflings worshiped the Maztican pantheon, honoring Zaltec and Nula the most. They also had a number of superstitions, mostly concerning the intermixing of adult males and married females, and each tribe would revere a talisman. This talisman influenced how they sacrificed people, something they did with any human caught in their territory. For instance, a tribe with a jaguar lord as their talisman would keep the creature in a pit in the village, and sacrifices would be deposited in the pit during an appropriate ceremony."
