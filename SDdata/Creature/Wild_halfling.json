        "Society": {
            "Combat": "Wild halflings made a unique, paralyzing poison called ''kurari'' which they used on their arrows for hunting and fighting. In addition, they would use knives to dispatch prey and to defend themselves.",
            "Religion": "The wild halflings worshiped the [[Maztican pantheon]], honoring [[Zaltec]] and [[Nula]] the most. They also had a number of superstitions, mostly concerning the intermixing of adult males and married females, and each tribe would revere a talisman. This talisman influenced how they sacrificed people, something they did with any human caught in their territory. For instance, a tribe with a [[jaguar lord]] as their talisman would keep the creature in a pit in the village, and sacrifices would be deposited in the pit during an appropriate ceremony."
