Calimite was a famous breed of light warhorse known for its speed and endurance.
A Calimite was considered a beautiful horse. It had an easily recognizable head shape with an arched neck and a raised tail carriage. It had large eyes and could come in a variety of colors, such as chestnut or gray.
Originating in the Calim Desert, legends told that Calimites were granted their speed by the djinni Calim himself.
Calimites were very expensive horses, costing an average of sixteen hundred gold pieces.
To call a Calishite a Calimite was a severe insult.
