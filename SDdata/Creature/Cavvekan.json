        "mainbody": "Cavvekan, also known as bat-faced dogs, were a species of creature that lived within the Underdark.\nAt first glance cavvekans resembled dogs from the surface realms of Toril, though they possessed a few distinct characteristics. Rather than fur, they had smooth black skin that somewhat resembled the texture of velvet. Their ears naturally pointed upright and their noses had an upturned, spade-shaped protuberance.\nLike bats of the surface, cavvekans had weak eyesight. They were naturally nearsighted and could only see about 10 (3 m) in front of them, regardless of lighting conditions. Like the drow, cavvekan could be temporarily blinded by bright light.\nTo make up for their poor sight, cavvekans had exceptionally sensitive hearing and could detect creatures within a radius of 120 (36.6 m).\nDue to their keen senses that served them well within the pitch black caverns of the Underdark, cavvekans were often used by drow and as hunting animals. They were rarely kept as pets, except when taken in by svirfneblin, instead often serving as working animals.\nIn the wild, cavvekans acted as scavengers and exhibited notable curiosity, often settling near drow communities. They fought in packs, and were known to bring down much larger game including humanoids."
