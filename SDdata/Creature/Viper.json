        "Uses": "In [[1374 DR]], the [[Shadowscale]] [[lizardfolk]] placed captured small black vipers inside sealed [[clay]] pots, which they would then hurl as grenades at their foes. The hungry and angry snake would then attack the nearest living being, ignoring the undead Shadowscales. A snake of this kind could be spawned once per day by use of a costly ''[[viper dagger]]''.",
