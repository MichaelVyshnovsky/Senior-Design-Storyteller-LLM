        "mainbody": "A viper was a common type of snake that varied greatly in size and appearance.\nVipers were not especially aggressive, but would bite if they felt threatened before trying to slither away. They were solitary predators.\nVipers used their bites and venom to kill prey and defend themselves. This venom harmed a victims health.\nIn 1374 DR, the Shadowscale lizardfolk placed captured small black vipers inside sealed clay pots, which they would then hurl as grenades at their foes. The hungry and angry snake would then attack the nearest living being, ignoring the undead Shadowscales. A snake of this kind could be spawned once per day by use of a costly viper dagger.\n*Rexin the viper familiar of Handragath, a wizard member of the Cult of the Dragon circa 1369 DR.\n*Shurrs Cult of the Dragon slaver Bishimzons familiar in the 1369 DR.\n*Teela the animal companion of the the druid Kagha in the Emerald Grove circa 1492 DR."
