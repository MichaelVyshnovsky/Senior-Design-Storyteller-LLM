Fire titans were a more powerful form of fire giant.
Fire titans typically preferred to get up close to their opponents and attack with flaming greatswords. When the opportunity to attack from a distance presented itself, they would often hurl lava at their opponent.
They were often known to enslave azers and employ fire archons as bodyguards.
They were occasionally known to fight alongside phoenixes.
Some fire titans were known to live in the City of Brass.
Some fire titans were known to serve the evil archomental Imix.
The queen of Maerimydra after the Spellplague was a fire titan named Hledh Hellspawn, although later scholars described her instead as a fiendish fire giant.
Rumors also spoke of felljaws, dragonspawn presumed to have descended from a mixing of black dragons and fire titans. Felljaws inhabited the Underdark of Returned Abeir.
