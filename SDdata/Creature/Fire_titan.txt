'''Fire titans''' were a more powerful form of [[fire giant]].

==Combat==
Fire titans typically preferred to get up close to their opponents and attack with flaming [[greatsword]]s. When the opportunity to attack from a distance presented itself, they would often hurl lava at their opponent.

==Society==
===Relations===
They were often known to enslave [[azer]]s{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|152}} and employ [[fire archon]]s as bodyguards.

They were occasionally known to fight alongside [[phoenix]]es.

===Homelands===
Some fire titans were known to live in the [[City of Brass]].

===Religion===
Some fire titans were known to serve the evil [[archomental]] [[Imix]].

==Notable Fire Titans==
The queen of [[Maerimydra]] after the [[Spellplague]] was a fire titan named [[Hledh Hellspawn]], although later scholars described her instead as a [[fiendish]] fire giant.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|31}}

Rumors also spoke of [[felljaw]]s, [[dragonspawn]] presumed to have descended from a mixing of [[black dragon]]s and fire titans. Felljaws inhabited the [[Underdark]] of [[Returned Abeir]].
