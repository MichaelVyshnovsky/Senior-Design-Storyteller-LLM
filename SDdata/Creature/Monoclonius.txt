'''Monoclonius''' ({{Pronounce|man|o|KLO|nee|us|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}), also known as '''centrosaurus''', or '''onehorn''' in the jungles of [[Malatra]],{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Village|4}} was a species of [[dinosaur]] living in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Monoclonius resembled a [[triceratops]], but instead of three horns it only had one, above its snout. Their body was protected from the front with a thick, bony head crest. It had very thick skin. Its head was very flexible, allowing it to turn it rapidly.

==Combat==
Their horn was strong and sharp, giving them an effective natural weapon against predators. Their skin was thick enough to protect them from all but the sharpest claws. For small predators, a herd of monoclonius tended to merely stampede over them.

==History==
At some point in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Chultan dwarves]] trained a pair of monoclonius to act as beasts of burden, carrying rock and debris away from the [[Wyrmheart Mine]] as well as its [[emerald]]s to settlements along the coast for trade.

==Ecology==
Monoclonius lived in herds.
===Diet===
Monoclonius were a herbivorous species of dinosaur.
===Habitats===
Monoclonius were one of the many species of dinosaur that inhabited [[Chult]].
