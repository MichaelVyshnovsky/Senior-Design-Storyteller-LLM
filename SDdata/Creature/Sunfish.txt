'''Sunfish''' was the name given to several species of fresh and saltwater fish.

==Description==
Species of sunfish had a distinct flat and round shape, making them a popular decorative motif in the ancient [[Netheril]]. Sunfish traveled and fed in schools, sometimes found in the shallows, hunting [[minnow]]s who came up from under the banks towards sunlight.

==Habitats==
Freshwater ponds of the forest of [[Cormanthor]] was home to a series of sunfish that was considered a game fish by locals. A species of tadpole-sized sunfish inhabited [[Arabel]]lan ponds and marshes.

==Usages==
[[Sunfish stew]] was a fanciful dish prepared for the [[patriar]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
