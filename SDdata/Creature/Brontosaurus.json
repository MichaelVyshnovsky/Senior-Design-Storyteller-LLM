        "mainbody": "A brontosaurus (|audio=Brontosaurus.ogg), also known as Thunderbeast, was a massive quadruped dinosaur.\nBrontosauruses were so large that most predators did not dare attack them.\nThese animals were not aggressive. They calmly lumbered through the jungles ignoring smaller creatures.\nBrontosauruses only fought in self-defense. If necessary, they could stomp enemies and hit them with their enormous tails, which were powerful enough to even kill smaller predators.\nBrontosauruses were common to the jungles of Chult, near swamp areas and rivers."
