            "Uses": "Naturally, rockstinger poison was a valuable and terrible tool for [[assassin]]s. Even a light nick from a [[dagger]] coated with the poison caused agonizing, scream-inducing pain like fire in the victim's veins. The effect would then evolve to cause painful muscle contractions that led to copious vomiting. Even after the acute effects of the poison wore off, the victim felt aches and fatigue for days afterward."

        "History": "During the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]], the assassin [[Barrabus the Gray]] made use of rockstinger poison while working for [[Herzgo Alegni]]. He used the poison to intimidate Lord [[Hugo Babris]] of [[Neverwinter]], going so far as to inflict the poison on a helpless guard just to instill fear of its terrible effects. The effects of the poison were so terrible that this demonstration nearly elicited regret from the ruthless Barrabus."
