        "mainbody": "Amoebic crawlers were a gelatinous species of ooze from the Far Realm. \nAmoebic crawlers resembled large, translucent worms with two tentacles emerging from the \"head.\" They derived from the fluid of the Amoebic Sea itself, and exuded a palpable dread as they crawled.\nAmoebic crawlers were mindless creatures, but were voracious hunters.\nAmoebic crawlers were difficult to spot, owing to their translucent color, and many an adventurer had accidentally walked into their acidic bodies. However, unlike a black pudding, the amoebic crawler could not corrode stone or metal, but only organic materials. Additionally, the crawlers ties to the Far Realm led them to exhibit some form of touch-based telepathy, allowing them to fill their victims with horrifying visions of their home plane and causing the victim intense psychic pain and nausea.\nAmoebic crawlers would propel themselves toward a creature and lash out with their two lithe, acidic tentacles. If it managed to hit the creature, it could restrain its foe and begin an external digestion process, stripping flesh from bones in plain sight. The bodies of their victims were then incorporated into their mass.\nAmoebic crawlers were often brought from the Far Realm by kaorti, who used the oozes in their quest to reform the Material Plane."
