        "mainbody": "Witherstenches, also known as skunk beasts, were strange, monstrous relatives of the more mundane skunk.\nThese creatures had very little fur, with what little they did have being in the form of dirty patches. Their skin was a blotchy yellow and covered in tiny purple spots. On average their bodies grew to be  in length.\nThe tiny purple spots that covered the body of a witherstench constantly emitted a powerful, nauseating musk odor.\nThese creatures generally fought with their claws.\nWitherstenches were carrion eaters.\nWitherstenches were primarily found in areas that were dank and filthy.\nA cups worth of musk from a witherstench could be mixed in a broth with the blood of a green dragon to enchant the same type of dragons tooth."
