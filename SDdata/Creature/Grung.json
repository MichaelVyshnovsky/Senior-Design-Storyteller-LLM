        "mainbody": "ult grungs usually stood at approximately {{SI|3'|'\"|long=yes}}. Males were generally smaller than females.

        "Abilities": "All grungs continuously secreted a poisonous substance that was harmless to them (however they were not immune to other poisons and venoms). This secretion was quite sticky, and grungs could easily wipe their weapons on their own skin to coat them in this highly toxic substance. When exposed to air, grung poison quickly deteriorated and broke down within a minute, making it extremely hard to harvest and bottle. Their saliva contained the same but weakened poison.\n\nWhile all grung poisons had similarly debilitating effects, each color of grung poison also caused unique ailments in their victims. Green grungs' poison restricted movement, blue grungs' poison caused prey to shout and yelp against their will, purple grungs' poison drove victims to desperately seek water, red grungs' poison caused ravenous hunger, orange grungs' poison caused irrational fears of one's friends, and gold grungs' poison could [[charm]] the victim as well as gift them the ability to speak the grung language. \n\nGrungs were amphibious, but although they could survive underwater, they were better climbers than swimmers.",
        "Behavior": "Due to their size, grungs often avoided direct confrontation and preferred ambushing their prey. The most common ambush strategy was laying camouflaged and waiting for their opponents, grung from other tribes, or quarry to venture into the range of their [[short bow]]s or throwing [[spear]]s.\n\nWhen unable to use their weapons of choice, grung could also deal significant amount of damage with a simple bite to deliver their less potent but still venomous saliva.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Grungs spoke their own frog-like language, called \"grung,\" and most did not learn additional languages.{{Cite dragon+/12/The Barber of Silverymoon|7-8}}  croaks (transcribed as \"roook\"), and ribbits or chirps (e.g., \"erp\"). It further made distinctions based on the length of croaks (e.g., \"roook\" versus \"rooooook\")."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Food Chain": "Grungs' carnivorous diet consisted of local mammals found within their territory, such as [[rat]]s. However, they were also known to eat travelers and members of other grung tribes. Due to their highly toxic skin, grungs had very few natural predators aside from each other. [[Giant snake]]s, however, were immune to grung toxins, and freely hunted these humanoids. [[Tabaxi]] were also said to hunt grungs, although for unknown purposes.",
            "Uses": "[[Yuan-ti]] considered grung eggs to be a delicacy when candied.\n\nWhile grung skin secretions lost their potency as poisons almost immediately, this substance could be harvested to produce fabulously colorful [[dye]]s. These could in turn be used to create colorants with magical properties when applied to the hair of [[humanoids]]:\n\n*Blue grung dye massively amplified the sound of hair, causing it to rustle loudly as the treated creature moved, and producing a deafening shockwave if the hair was shaken vigorously.\n*Green grung dye caused the creature's hands and feet to also turn green, and granted enhanced jumping and climbing abilities, although engaging in these behaviors was quite painful.\n*Purple grung dye caused the creature's hair to become sopping wet and to continuously generate purple-dyed water that stained anything it soaked into.",
            "Homelands": "Grungs were common in [[Chult]], and were known to occupy the jungle's rivers and flooded ruins.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], grungs were known to exist on the planet of [[Oerth]]."
        },
        "History": "When the people of [[Omu]] began worshiping the [[Primal spirit#The Nine Trickster Gods of Omu|Nine Trickster Gods]] after [[Ubtao]] abandoned them in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], one of these Tricksters was a grung called [[Nangnang]]. Subsequently, Nangnang and the rest of the Tricksters Gods would be slain by [[Acererak]] and sealed in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] during the late 14{{th}} century DR, but worship of Nangnang would continue among the grung of Chult. The grung would end up occupying [[Nangnang's Shrine]] in the Omuan ruins, and in the century to come would war with local [[yuan-ti]] and [[vegepygmies]] in order to maintain their hold on the Shrine.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the despotic grung King [[Groak]] of [[Dungrunglung]] demanded that his subjects erect a {{SIAdj|60|foot}} tall shrine to the dead goddess, and that his priestess [[Krr'ook]] attempt to summon her so that the king could mate her. Knowing the scheme would fail and that she would be blamed, Krr'ook devised a plan to use a set of ''[[Nolzur's marvelous pigments]]'' to create a life-like facsimile of the goddess to fool her king.",
