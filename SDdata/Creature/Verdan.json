        "Description": "Young verdan were similar to small [[half-elf|half-elves]] with jade-green skin and about as tall as [[goblin]]s.

It was, however, a slow and ineffective form of communication that could only transmit simple ideas and concepts.",
        "Personality": "Thanks to their extreme mutability, verdan did not assign any cultural significance to skin color, stature, gender, or appearance. They viewed their fluidity as an opportunity to acquire new experiences and to grow in empathy with others.\n\nFierce defenders of diversity and freedom, verdan vocally opposed all forms of oppression, especially those rooted in discrimination against appearance, gender, or race. They were generally considered humble and trustworthy by others.\n\nDue to their curiosity, and since verdan did not possess a collective history, they were sometimes viewed as gullible and innocent, and were often picked as easy targets by scammers. However, they possessed a unique insight that, over time, helped them discern when others were not being sincere.",
        "Society": "Constant travelers, verdan embraced the local cultural practices of the places they migrated to, adopting local naming customs and languages. However, they lacked a sense of belonging even in the most welcoming communities. It was common for verdan to become wanderers, traveling either as lone individuals or as entire families, carrying all their possessions on their backs. As they moved into new areas, it was not unusual for verdan to change their names as well in order to match local customs.\n\nWhen verdan travelers met, they were eager to share stories and experiences. It was common for them to drop all their activities in order to spend as much time as possible engaging in cultural exchanges with other verdan travelers.",
        "Ecology": "Verdan reached adulthood at roughly 24 years of age. It was estimated that they could live to be 200 years old, but by the late 15{{th}} century DR no verdan had died of old age, so their actual lifespan remained the subject of speculation.\n\nVerdan blood was black and granted them enhanced natural recuperative capabilities.",
        "History": "The verdan were originally a large clan of [[goblin]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s that dwelled in a vast but unknown location in the [[Underdark]]. Sometime in the 15{{th}} century DR, they were exposed to the entropic power of an entity known as [[That-Which-Endures]], losing all memory of their origins and mutating into a new race. Deprived of their history and afraid of the horrors of the Underdark, they fled to the surface and were met with curiosity by other races, as they traveled the world in search of new experiences."
