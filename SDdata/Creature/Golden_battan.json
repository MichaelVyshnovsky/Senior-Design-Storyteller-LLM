        "History": "Considered a delicacy by the locals, golden battans were extremely easy to catch. Fishermen simply sprinkled bread crumbs or ground [[corn]] onto the surface of the water. The golden battan were lured to the surface and ate the bait, waiting patiently for more food at the water's surface with their snouts poking through the water where they could be caught by hand."
