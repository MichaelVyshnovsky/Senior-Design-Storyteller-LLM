        "mainbody": "A gray ooze was a type of ooze, resembling wet stone or rock.\nIt was a thick puddle of gray sludge, roughly  thick,  wide, and up to  across, that closely resembled wet stone or an amorphous rock formation.\nWhen one of these creatures reached an exceptionally large capacity they were known to mildly develop greater intellect.\nGray oozes could corrode metal at a rate comparable to that of a black pudding, though its acids could not eat through stone or wood.\nWhen one of these creatures reached an exceptionally large they would develop latent psionics, allowing them to unleash a psychic crush, but in return be left vulnerable to retaliation. They were only known to unleash this ability whenever a creature within  of them used psionic powers.\nGray oozes were known to attack in groups, dissolving enemies and absorbing their bones as slime to grow.\nAcidic secretions of the gray ooze corroded metal at an alarming rate\n* White Maw, a massive and abnormally intelligent gray ooze that lived in the Doomvault in 1486 DR.\nGray oozes reproduced by breaking small droplets off of them after a meal, called budding, which later grew into gray oozes themselves.\nGray oozes were known to be found in subterranean areas, such as caverns and dungeons. They were mindless scavengers who dragged themselves around caves or sewers, while absorbing and digesting whatever they came across. Unlike other oozes, the gray variety couldnt move on ceilings or walls, hence it was left to slide its way along subterranean floors.\nIn the Abyss, gray oozes could be found in Shedaklah, the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss."
