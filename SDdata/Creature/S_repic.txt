Srepic was a species of carnivorous and scavenging fish found in the Sleepy Lake of the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur.
Srepic were large slender fish of huge shiny silver scales. Most specimens reached  in length.
The fish were dangerous flesh-eating creatures that often schooled under the floating raft villages of the Nubari Zantira tribe, waiting for food to be dropped into the lake. Locals believed that Srepic not only ate scavenged human food, but also disobedient Zantira children.
Srepic were hunted by the Zantira spearfishers for their delicious meat and huge bright silver scales, used for decorations and accessories.
