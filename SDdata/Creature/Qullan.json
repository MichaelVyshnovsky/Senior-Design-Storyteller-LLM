        "mainbody": "A qullan was a rare creature, resembling a tall and muscular humanoid covered in scars and warpaint.\nQullans were heavily muscular humanoids that stood over  tall. They rarely wore armor they often roamed naked or in clothes fashioned from the pelts of tigers. Qullans prided themselves on their battle scars, often enhancing such former wounds with warpaint.\nQullans were a tribal species and seemed to be isolationist. Making contact with qullans often proved impossible. They had incredible concentration, allowing them to resist even the most brutal tortures.\nForcing a qullan to do something atypical, or charming them, would cause a \"feedback\" effect on the one wishing to communicate with the qullan, killing them.\nThese humanoids typically fought with broadswords. These were renowned for their incredible sharpness, which had not been replicated throughout the Realms. But despite their power, these swords easily blunted.\nAs well as honing great physical prowess, qullans continuously emitted rays of confusion, causing anyone coming close to the creatures to either stand on the spot, or attack a nearby creature, either friend or foe, if they could not resist the rays.\nMany qullans were proficient in producing and utilizing poisons, which they made into darts and fired through blowpipes. Such potent poisons would bring death to their target, unless those of incredible holy power intervened.\nDue to their isolationist ways, making contact with qullans often proved impossible.\nDakon were known to hold great hostility towards qullan. This often resulted in violent conflicts with them and their banderlog allies.\n* Tee-a-nicknick, a half-qullan that plotted to assassinate Captain Deudermont in Luskan."
