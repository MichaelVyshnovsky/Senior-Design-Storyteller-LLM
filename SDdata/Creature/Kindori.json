        "Description": "Adult kindori could grow to a length of up to {{SI|80|ft}}. They had a row of small eyes on either sides of their snouts, that emit radiant beams of light.\n\nThey had no notable mouths and did not require food or even air for sustenance. Rather, they nourished themselves from starlight.",
        "Abilities": "These celestial beings were so massive they had their own gravitational pull, and formed their own [[air envelope]]s.",
        "Behavior": "To communicate with their kind across the vast reaches of wildspace, kindori flashed the light beams from their eyes.",
        "Combat": "If forced to fight, kindori used the light emitted from their eyes to blind foes. They would could also whip their tails at enemies to devastating effect.",
        "Ecology": "While kindori were not prone to hostility, they were preyed upon by various carnivores native to wildspace, including [[lunar dragon|lunar]] and [[solar dragon]]s.\n\nVarious species of mold and moss, along with some parasites, grew along the bodies of kindori. Scavenging creatures subsequently fed off these lifeforms. Interestingly enough, kindori carcasses did not completely deteriorate.\n\nKindori skeletons were sometimes used as frames for [[spelljamming]] [[spelljammer|vessels]]."
