        "mainbody": "Giant lobsters were a monstrous variety of the crustaceans of the same name.These core sources &mdash Monstrous Manual on page 50, Monstrous Compendium Volume Two on page 29, and the 1 edition Dungeon Masters Guide on pages 180 & 224 &mdash all state that crayfish and lobsters are the same thing. While crayfish are similar to lobsters and are even colloquially known as \"freshwater lobsters,\" they are distinct creatures.\nAround the 14 century DR, a juvenile storm giant named Alexandra went into the Dragon Reach with an apparatus of Kwalish that had been gifted to her by her father and playfully interacted with some of the local giant lobsters.\nAround that time, one could purchase a whole giant lobster to dine upon at Sharkeys Bar & Grill.\nThese creatures were known to inhabit the Dragon Reach.\nGiant nautiluses were known to prey upon these creatures.\nA giant lobster could be summoned with the spell Monster Summoning IV."
