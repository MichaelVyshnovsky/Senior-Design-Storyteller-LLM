        "Description": "These dinosaurs were immense and had many defenses to protect them from their many predators.  Along their spine from head to tail were a set of alternating bone plates. Their tails ended with a collection of sharp spikes, which were a yard (one meter) long. They had short legs with hoof-like feet.",
        "Behavior": "{{Fq\n|text = They have no malice in them, but their size and strength makes them formidable if threatened.\n|source = [[Azaka Stormfang]]}}\nA stegosaurus would use the plates on its back to distribute heat from the sun.\n\nThey walked on four legs but could rear up to reach the leaves on tall trees.\n\nThey had very tiny brains and so were not very intelligent. They tended to stick together in herds of five to eight animals.",
        "Combat": "If threatened, a stegosaurus would continuously turn away from the threat, keeping its spiked tail toward the potential enemy. If attacked, a stegosaurus would kick with its forelegs, much like a horse, or it would thrash out with its spiked tail. A stegosaurus was particularly dangerous if charging, and it could easily trample smaller creatures underfoot.",
        "History": "Stegosauruses, like most dinosaurs, originated in Chult."
