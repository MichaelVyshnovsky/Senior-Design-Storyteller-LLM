Doves were a species of bird found in the Realms.
In northwest Faer√ªn, doves were quite prevalent in the North Ward of Waterdeep, so much so that they were the wards mascot.
White doves were favored animals of the deities Ilmater and Isis,Sunes entry in Faiths & Avatars lists "fire doves", but it is unclear what these are their placement in the list implies a mundane species. The "Deity Dos and Donts" web enhancement for Faiths and Pantheons changes this to "red doves", supporting this.
They were also commonly seen as familiars of con-tinh.
Doves were sometimes plucked, roasted, and eaten, with roasted dove served in the kitchens of Halarahh in Halruaa
In certain auguries, the future was divined from the random flight patterns of wild birds such as doves. In the late 14 century DR, Procopio Septus, the Lord Mayor of Halarahh and a diviner, devised a way to read the future in flights of doves magically lured to a dovecote in his kitchen for subsequent culinary use. This had two benefits as he enjoyed roasted dove.
