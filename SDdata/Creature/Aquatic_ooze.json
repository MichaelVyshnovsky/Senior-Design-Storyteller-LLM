        "mainbody": "An '''aquatic ooze''' was a category of [[ooze]]s that lived and thrived in water. Three oozes were considered aquatic oozes: [[bloodbloater]]s, [[flotsam ooze]]s, and [[reekmurk]]s, and other deep places of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description and behavior": "The properties of aquatic oozes were in many ways similar to other oozes. They ranged in size from small to huge. Although all aquatic oozes were blind, they had [[blindsight]]. Due to their apparent lack of sentience, mind-affecting magic did not function against them.\n\nAlthough all three were found in water and classed together, they behaved remarkably differently. Unlike most oozes, [[bloodbloater]]s were not amorphous, but disk-shaped and similar to small jellyfish in both appearance and water movement, [[flotsam ooze]]s were more typical oozes that lurked among sea debris, and [[reekmurk]]s took the form of inky clouds in water."
