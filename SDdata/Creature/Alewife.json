        "mainbody": "'''Alewives''' were a type of [[fey]] that had an affinity for taverns and other places with alcoholic drinks.",
        "Description": "Alewives resembled tiny elderly women with rosy cheeks and large smiles. They appeared to wear colorful coat-like clothing.",
        "Personality": "Alewives' personalities reflected the tavern that they inhabited, which normally meant they were friendly. When the mood of the tavern turned sour, so would their demeanor.",
        "Abilities": "Alewives had powerful magical abilities. They could create the effects of the spells ''[[friends]]'' and ''[[prestidigitation]]''. Once per day each, they could also cast the spells ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[grease]]'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', ''[[purify food and drink]]'', and ''[[create food and water]]'' (but only to create only [[ale]]).\n\nThey also had the ability to possess any drinking vessel in their vicinity that had touched alcohol, animating it and sprouting limbs and facial features from it. This could be countered by a ''[[protection from evil and good]]''.\n\nAlewives also had auras that could compel people to drink until they passed out.",
        "Combat": "In combat, alewives often fought with broken [[bottle]]s.",
        "History": "An alewife resided in the [[Growling Groghouse]] in the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]]. She would only talk to beings who were already drunk.{{Cite adventurers league/Last Orders at the Yawning Portal|13}}"
