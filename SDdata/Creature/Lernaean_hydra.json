        "Description": "These creatures resembled the standard hydra, a multi-headed reptile with scales that ranged from grayish-brown to dark brown.",
        "Abilities": "A lernaean hydra would grow two necks and heads whenever one was severed, though this could be prevented by applying fire\n\nHowever, Lernaean hydras could only support an amount of heads and necks that was exactly twice that of their original amount. Any heads and necks beyond that amount would wither away and fall off within a day.The ability to regenerate heads was the sole defining feature of Lernaean hydras between 1{{st}} and 3{{rd}} edition. In ''[[Monster Manual 3.5 edition]]'', this trait was given to all hydras and the Lernaean was thus excluded from the book.\n\nUntil all heads were removed from their body, a Lernaean hydra could not die. The [[spell]]s ''[[disintegrate]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', and ''[[slay living]]'' were some of the few known means to bypass this creature's near-invulnerability and kill them outright.",
        "History": "A fifty-headed Lernaean hydra was said to have been slain by the [[giant pantheon|giant goddess]] [[Hiatea]] in order to prove herself to her father, [[Annam All-Father]]. She was said to have used her [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[spear]] to slay it, preventing the regeneration of its heads by cauterizing them with fire.\n\nIn the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a Lernaean hydra was known to lair within a hidden room of [[Undermountain]]'s third floor. Around [[1372 DR]], a six-headed Lernaean hydra roamed the valley of [[High Thorog]] after having been freed from [[Telkoun's Tower]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Like the standard hydra, these creatures were typically found in marshes, swamps, and underground lairs. They were also known to be found in the marshes of [[Cormyr]], including the [[Farsea Marshes]] and the [[Tun Marshes]].",
            "Relationships": "Much like other hydras, Lernaeans were often preyed upon by [[dragon]]s and were rarely ever known to be domesticated."
