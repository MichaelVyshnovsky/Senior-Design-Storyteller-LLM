Spitters were small elemental vermin native to the Elemental Plane of Water that could also be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Spitters possessed a lizards body with the head, eyes, hands and feet of a frog. Their mouth was filled with sharpened teeth. Their bumpy ridged bodies were usually green in color. They typically measured  in length.
Spitters survived by consuming any liquids they stumbled across.
If threatened, a spitter attempted to bite or spit pellets of water that bludgeoned its attacker.
