'''Bog hags''' were vile, swamp-dwelling [[hag]]s, heinous crones that preyed on [[human]]s. They stole the flesh of their victims to hide their hideous forms, using their hides as an appealing, skin-deep disguise.

==Description==
In their true forms, bog hags appeared as green, ugly beldams with jagged teeth and sharp nails, standing about {{SI|6|ft}} tall and weighing about {{SI|110|lb|k}} on average. Like other hags, they could disguise their natural appearance, most often taking the form of a human, [[half-elf]], young [[elf|elven]] woman, or [[eladrin]].

==Personality==
Bog hags were skilled in the art of deception and reading intent, as well as intimidation. They were also well-versed in matters of the natural world.

==Abilities==
Bog hags could walk unimpeded through swamps, swim as fast as they could run, and could breathe underwater. Fire was particularly dangerous to them. The unwholesome presence of a bog hag made recovery from injury more difficult.

Unlike ordinary hags, which used illusion or bodily alteration to change their appearances without aid, a bog hag altered herself by stealing and wearing the skin of her victims. Through an innate supernatural power, their body shaped and conformed to the skin suit, allowing them to temporarily masquerade as the victim for a time.  After shifting skins,

==Combat==
Bog hags staked out territory from below bodies of water near human communities, waiting to ambush the unwary that came by. They fought with hit-and-run tactics, charging past their prey as they slashed them with their claws.

==Society==
===Homelands===
Bog hags dwelt in marshes and mires{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|65}}

===Relationships===
Bog hags sometimes performed dark rituals to create [[lacedon]] servants.

==Notable Bog Hags==
* [[Evelda Bloodbath]], one of the captains of the [[Tidescourge]] pirate gang.
