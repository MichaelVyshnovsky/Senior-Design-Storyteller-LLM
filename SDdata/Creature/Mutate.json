        "mainbody": "A '''mutate''' was a creature whose physical form and characteristics were altered by exposure to forces of the [[Far Realm]].",
        "Description": "Myriad creatures could be transformed into mutates. Notable among these were various [[humanoid]] races, along with [[cloaker]]s and [[otyugh]]s and others. The physical forms of mutated creatures became dark and twisted: some individual mutates grew wings, exuded viscous slime, or even warped with the bodies of creatures they consumed.\n\nWhile some mutates were created by inadvertent exposure to Far Realm energy and magic, others made the conscious decision to bring it upon themselves.",
        "Abilities": "Mutates often developed some form of [[psionic]] power.",
        "History": "Throughout their history, the [[illithid]]s of [[Toril]] conducted experiments upon animals, beasts, and sentient beings with Far Realm energy. Their efforts created many of the mutates that dwelled within the depths of the [[Underdark]].",
        "Notable Mutates": "* [[Malinia]], a member of the [[Cult of the Obelisk]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n* A cloaker mutate that absorbed the corpse of the [[dwarven]] scholar [[Thorgran Ironquill]]."
