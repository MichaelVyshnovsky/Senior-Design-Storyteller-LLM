It had a set of large, sharp mandibles.\nTenebrous worms attacked a target with its large mandibles, delivering a lethal poison. The bristles that covered their upper body were coated with the same kind of poison. Any creature who came into contact with the poison required neutralize poison or slow poison spells to be cured, otherwise they died.\nFemale gloomwing moths laid up to ten eggs on the corpse of another creature. After twelve days, tenebrous worms emerged from their eggs and began feeding on the corpse.\nTenebrous worms could be found in the forests of the demi-plane of Shadow. and the Shrouded Jungle.\nThese creatures were a favored monster of the deity Mask.\nA pair of tenebrous worm mandibles were valuable, worth up to 3,000 gold pieces per pair."
