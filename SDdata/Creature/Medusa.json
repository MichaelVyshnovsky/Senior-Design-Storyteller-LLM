        "mainbody": "A '''medusa''' ({{Plural|medusae|refs=}} {{Plural|medusas|alt=yes|refs=}}) was a monstrous and hateful creature that was capable of [[petrification|petrifying]] any creature that met its gaze.",
        "Description": {
            "Variants": "An uncommon variant of medusa known as a [[greater medusa]] had the lower torso of a snake and its entire body covered by thin scales, with a total body length of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. They produced considerably more potent poison, which rendered even their skins harmful to the touch. They also used their innate poison to coat their weapons and arrows.\n\nIn the [[Utter East]], variants of medusae similar to greater medusae were sometimes referred to as \"gorgons\" (not to be confused with the [[gorgon|iron-skinned bulls]] of the same name). While their look could petrify a living creature, it was reported that the effect was usually temporary. They lurked within the ruins of [[Phantom Pass]] and [[Old Stone Keep]] and in the [[Puzzle Palace]].<ref group=\"note\">''Blood & Magic'''s artwork and terminology do not closely match typical D&D monsters. The Gorgon unit is a neutral enemy unit. While it takes after the D&D medusa in key respects, its name is taken from [[Wikipedia:Gorgon|the mythological gorgon]].\n\nAn extremely rare variant of male medusa was known as a [[maedar]], which lacked the head serpents and the petrifying gaze of regular medusae, but possessed great physical strength and in some cases a poisonous weakening gaze."
        },
        "Personality": "Most medusae despised their own powers and viewed their abilities as a curse. They directed their frustration and anger outwards, seeking to petrify any living creature they encountered, and only used restraint when hunting prey for food or when searching for a mate.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Petrification DMG14.png|thumb|250px|''A medusa turns a man to stone.'']]\nThe glowing red eyes of a medusa were feared for their petrifying power. Anyone within a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of a medusa who looked at its eyes could be transformed into lifeless stone within seconds, at the medusa's discretion. It was possible to resist that power through extraordinary physical resilience, or by averting one's eyes from the medusa's. The petrification was permanent, unless reversed with magic such as a ''[[greater restoration]]'' [[spell]] or similar.\n\nA medusa's vision and petrifying gaze also reached into the [[Ethereal plane|Ethereal]] and the [[Astral Plane]]. the creature's features could only be recognized at dangerously close distances: its bright red eyes could only be seen from {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} or less, while the serpents were only visible from a distance of less than {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}}. Although a medusa's gaze affected creatures in the Ethereal, its head snakes and physical attacks had no effect on ethereal targets.\n\nA medusa was immune to the petrifying stare of other medusae, but was susceptible to be turned into stone by its own gaze, for example when looking at its own reflection in a [[mirror]] or other reflective surface. Even after death, a medusa's eyes retained their power for several days, becoming weaker as the corpse decayed.",
        "Combat": "A medusa's typical strategy was to lure potential victims within the {{SIAdj|30|ft}} range of its gaze and then induce them into looking in its eyes. If the victims managed to avert their eyes in time, the medusa followed up with powerful attacks from its head serpents, whose [[venom]] was potent enough to severely poison or even kill a creature. If none of those strategies succeeded, medusae were also competent with a number of weapons, such as [[knife|knives]], [[short sword]]s [[shortbow]]s, and [[longbow]]s. Many medusae were considered skilled archers and some greater medusae were known to coat arrows with their [[poison]]ous saliva or blood.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Medusae respected the [[Titan]] [[Skoraeus Stonebones]], but they did not worship him.<ref name=Dr#106-p17>{{Cite dragon/106/The Ecology of the Maedar|17}} Rather, religious medusae worshiped the [[naga]] [[deity]] [[Shekinester]], who they called '''Shekenster'''.<ref>{{cite dragon/296/Worshipers of the Forbidden|50}} The [[yuan-ti]] god [[Sseth]] was known to favor medusae and maedar, often working through them."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Physiology": "Medusae ate sparingly and had small appetites. Mated couples of medusae and maedar usually fed by the use of the maedar's ability to turn broken fragments of petrified victims back into flesh.",
            "Reproduction": "Medusae could reproduce by mating amongst themselves and with other humanoids. If mating with a human, a female medusa produced a clutch of between two and six eggs that always hatched into female medusae. The fate of a human after mating with a medusa was usually death by petrification.\n\nIf a medusa and a maedar mated, the eggs produced human offspring in 99% of the cases, in which case the babies were immediately petrified upon seeing their mother. In only 1% of the cases, a maedar was born.\n\nMedusae laid their eggs within one month of mating, and the eggs had an incubation period of eight months. Young medusa hatchlings resembled human baby girls with green stubby tendrils growing from their heads, which came alive as serpents once they reached two years of age. Young medusae matured at the same rate as humans, and acquired the ability to petrify others upon reaching adolescence.",
            "Uses": "The blood of medusae had special properties that allowed it to reverse the process of petrification. In order for it to work, the blood needed to be applied to the petrified creature's mouth or lips by a skilled healer. It could only reverse the condition if the victim had been petrified within 24 hours. Medusa blood could also be used to craft ''[[potion of human control|potions of human control]]'' and ''[[potion of mammal control|potions of mammal control]]''. Older medusae were capable of brewing [[potion]]s that could restore petrified creatures, which they traded amongst themselves and employed to restore petrified creatures by accident.\n\nThe venom from a medusa's snakes was renowned among assassins for its potency. A medusa's eyes could also be used as an ingredient for the scroll.\n\nThe head snakes themselves could be harvested to produce ''[[potion of reptile control|potions of reptile control]]''. However, they were rarely harvested due to the horrible stench that emanated from them after death.\n\nThe stone from petrified corpses of medusae victims, when pulverized, could be used as a material component for spells that contacted denizens of other [[plane]]s. This practice, however, tended to be restricted to evil [[priest]]s,"
        },
        "History": "[[File:Medusa 2e.jpg|thumb|''A medusa armed with a [[dagger]].'']]\nSome vain mortals could strike bargains with powerful [[fiend]]s such as [[archdevil]]s and [[demon lord]]s, offering everything in exchange for the gift of long-lasting beauty, power, and the admiration of others. Upon the expiration of the splendorous years bargained for, the price was collected and the mortals were turned into medusae.\n\nIn the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], members the [[Zhentarim]] were rumored to pursue an alliance with medusae and maedar of the [[Goblin Marches]] and the [[Stonelands]], offering treasure in exchange for recruiting them as agents of the Black Network. They conducted negotiations while under the protection of an unknown [[spell]] that purportedly protected them from the medusae's gaze.\n\nAround the same time, the inhabitants of [[Minroe]] developed a defense against a colony of medusae that lurked in a system of nearby caves, which were the source of prized [[pixie cap mushroom]]s that the inhabitants gathered and sold at high prices. The Minrovan farmers domesticated a variety of [[hedgehog shrieker]] that had developed a natural defense against medusae and only reacted to their presence. The citizens planted shrieker gardens around town to protect themselves from attacks, while gatherers carried them in carts when entering the caves.\n\nA group of three medusae inhabited the [[Sargauth Level]] of [[Undermountain]] in the mid‒14{{th}} century DR, but they had been defeated by adventurers by the late 15{{th}} century. By then, another group of two medusae inhabited the [[Caverns of Ooze]], much deeper down the complex.",
        "Notable Medusae": "* [[Marlos Urnrayle]], the leader of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n* [[Neheedra Duskryn]], a former [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] from [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Yashar]], a [[sorcerer]] who guarded the [[Undying Temple]] in the 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Zalkoré]], an [[Omu]]an queen who was transformed into a medusa by an [[erinyes]] and subsequently lost her sanity."
