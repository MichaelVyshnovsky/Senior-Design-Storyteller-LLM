Against living creatures, shadows were very aggressive and quick to attack, they were known to hesitate briefly when confronted with someone wearing a silkstone. Their favored victims were innocent creatures, who lived morally good lives.\nTheir touch sapped the strength of living creatures.\nThe touch of a shadow was painfully chilly and sapped the targets strength away. Every time they sapped the strength of their victim, the victims shadow darkened. On death, the shadow split away, if the victim wasnt evil and rose as a shadow enslaved to the killer.\nAs an incorporeal creature, a shadow could fly. It had acute senses and a shadows normal strategy was to hide in a dark place and attack bypassing creatures.\nWhile in dark areas, a shadow could hide away from view. and it could also move through cracks of only 1 inch width.\nShadows were encountered alone, in gangs of two to five or in swarms of six to eleven individuals.\nShadows could be found anywhere, preferring to hide in dark places before attacking creatures who passed by.\nBeyond Toril, shadows could be found on the dark part of the planet Radole due to a gate to the Negative Material plane.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, shadows could be found in the Domains of Dread and Palpitatia the 241 layer of the Abyss.\nThe drow deities Kiaransalee and Vhaeraun were served by shadows, and they were sometimes sent by them to aid their followers. Shadows were also known to serve Eshowdow of Chult, where they played a central role in the sinister rituals of the Eshowe.\nSome clerics of Shar, known as Nightcloaks, were capable of summoning shadows to their aid.\nthumb|right|250px|Anastrianna Galanodel and her raven familiar Tillatal.\nAnastrianna Galanodel was an elven adventurer slain by a shadow some time after the Fall of Netheril.
