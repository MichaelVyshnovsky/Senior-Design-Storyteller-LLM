        "Description": "Shadows were incorporeal and were hard to see in dark areas but were easy to see in brightly lit areas.",
        "Personality": "Shadows hated life and light. Against living creatures, shadows were very aggressive and quick to attack, they were known to hesitate briefly when confronted with someone wearing a [[silkstone]]. Their favored victims were innocent creatures, who lived morally good lives.\n\nTheir touch sapped the strength of living creatures.",
        "Combat": "The touch of a shadow was painfully chilly and sapped the target's strength away. Every time they sapped the strength of their victim, the victim's shadow darkened. On death, the shadow split away, if the victim wasn't evil and rose as a shadow enslaved to the killer.\n\nAs an incorporeal creature, a shadow could fly. It had acute senses and a shadow's normal strategy was to hide in a dark place and attack bypassing creatures.\n\nWhile in dark areas, a shadow could hide away from view. and it could also move through cracks of only 1 inch width.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Shadows could be found anywhere, preferring to hide in dark places before attacking creatures who passed by.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], shadows could be found on the dark part of the planet [[Radole]] due to a [[gate]] to the [[Negative Material plane]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], shadows could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]] and [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 241: Palpitatia|Palpitatia the 241{{st}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]].",
            "Relationships": "The [[drow]] [[deities]] [[Kiaransalee]] and [[Vhaeraun]] were served by shadows, and they were sometimes sent by them to aid their followers.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}} Shadows were also known to serve [[Eshowdow]] of [[Chult]], where they played a central role in the sinister rituals of the [[Eshowe]].<ref>\n\nSome [[cleric]]s of [[Shar]], known as [[Nightcloak]]s, were capable of summoning shadows to their aid."

        "Notable Shadows": "[[File:Shadow.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Anastrianna Galanodel]] and her [[raven]] [[familiar]] [[Tillatal]].'']]\n[[Anastrianna Galanodel]] was an [[elven]] adventurer slain by a shadow some time after the [[Fall of Netheril]]. She became an [[emancipated spawn]] when the shadow was destroyed by her companions. In the [[-306 DR|Year of the Wan Shades, âˆ’306 DR]], she joined an army of similarly freed \"[[wan shade]]s\" to strike against the many [[undead]] of [[Netheril]]."
