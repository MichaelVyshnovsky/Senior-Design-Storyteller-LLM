        "mainbody": "fyrefly was a flying insect that flickered with flame at night. It grew to  in length.\nThe fyreflies of Cormanthor gathered in massive swarms on clear summer evenings, and this caused scorching and damage to the foliage in the area. This continued until the morning light arrived and they dissipated.\nIf there was an extremely clear night in the Cormanthor forest, the fyreflies mistook the highly visible stars for an invasion of rival fyreflies and went into a frenzy, causing extensive damage and igniting many fires.\nIn 1362 DR these insects were used as sources of light in the citrus orchards of Thay. They were placed inside the lanterns affixed to branches, illuminating the trees that were worked by slaves in the dark.\nThe fyrefly was a herbivorous species. In Cormanthors rimwood area, they were known to eat cornflower pollen.\nThese creatures could be found in the forests of Cormanthor, and the Fire Marshes of High Moor. Fireflies also illuminated warm summer nights in the city of Sumbria of the Blade Kingdoms.\nOutside of the Prime Material plane, fireflies inhabited the plane of Arborea, and could be found in the areas around the Gilded Hall, Fermata, and Brightwater.\nA live fyrefly could be used as a material component for casting the chill shield variant of fireshield."
