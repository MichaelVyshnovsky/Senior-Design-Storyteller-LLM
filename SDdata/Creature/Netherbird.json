        "mainbody": "etherbirds  were a species of birds who served the god of tyranny Bane.\nNetherbirds ranged in size from small to near-human-sized, but they had black, dusty feathers, hideously large talons, and razor-sharp beaks, and they usually stank of blood and decay.\nNetherbirds were relatively intelligent for animals, and could be trained as messenger birds.\nNetherbirds attacked with beak and talon, screaming and hissing at their prey as they did so. They could fly, and quickly, but were not particularly skilled in the air.\nNetherbirds were always found in flocks of 3â€“30 specimens. They laired in the desolate regions of crags and high, rolling moors.\nNetherbirds would eat all manner of flesh, living or dead. Their black, leathery eggs hatched unattended.\nNetherbirds served Bane, but may have originally come from Avernus."
