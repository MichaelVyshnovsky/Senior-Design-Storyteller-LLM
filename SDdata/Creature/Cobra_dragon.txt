'''Cobra dragons''' were a rare species found in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Cobra dragons were winged, serpentine reptiles that ranged in length from {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} as hatchlings, to as much as {{SI|43|ft|long=yes}}. They had glossy black scales on the back and sides, and bright orange scales on the underbelly. On the neck directly behind the head was a hood of skin akin to that of a [[king cobra]].

==Behavior==
These creatures rivaled [[Faer√ªn]]ian dragons in greed and aggressiveness. The favorite hobby of cobra dragons was collecting skulls, with skulls of rare and mighty creatures being the most valued by these serpentine creatures. A cobra dragon's favorite collectible skulls included those of [[cave bear]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[giant]]s, and [[unicorn]]s, as they were some of the largest, rarest, and most powerful creatures. [[Humanoid]] skulls, meanwhile, might be considered interesting but were worth little as they could be gotten so easily. Gifting a skull, especially a rare skull, when speaking with a cobra dragon was very helpful in improving its disposition.

==Abilities==
Akin to other dragons, cobra dragons had an aura of fear and the ability to detect anything hidden or invisible around them.

Cobra dragons did not use magic like other dragons, and actually had a strong resistance to it. They were immune to their own breath weapons, as well as all other [[fire]]- and heat-based attacks, no matter whether the source of the heat-based attack was considered magical or mundane. However, they were vulnerable to [[ice]]- and cold-based attacks.

==Combat==
They relied on their natural capabilities to catch their targets. A cobra dragon fought using its claws, exceptionally dangerous [[venom]]ous bite, and its long whip-like tail. When bitten, the victim quickly grew weak, dizzy, and frequently nauseous, making it impossible to drink or eat anything, and they would experience extensive internal bleeding. This carried on for ten minutes, after which the victim either recovered or grew worse, falling unconscious and in a state of shock, marked by pale skin and sweating. Death came five minutes later. The poison had to be cured with magic.

They possessed a [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] that consisted of a cone of fire that extended {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}, with a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} width at the end. Alternatively, a cobra dragon could breathe its fire below its own body, causing it to spread out in a ring of fire {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} wide, effectively like a ''[[wall of fire]]'' and burning all within except the cobra dragon. This was used defensively when surrounded by multiple hostile creatures, like in the context of an ambush.

After breathing fire, the cobra dragon released a black smoke cloud from its nostrils, covering an area with a {{SI|45|ft|long=yes}} radius around the dragon. Discounting the dragon, everyone caught inside the cloud was beset by coughing, nausea, and irritation of the eyes. A cloud lingered for four to sixteen minutes before dissipating, while strong drifts would only shift, not disperse, it. If multiple clouds overlapped, the negative effects of said clouds would multiply.

==Ecology==
===Reproduction===
Male and female cobra dragons had a mating ritual in spring in which they fought but did not wound one another, then consummated in a display described as "fiery". They did this only in young adulthood or adulthood, while older cobra dragons took pride in not mating and boasted that they had outgrown the mating drive. The female would usually lay up to four eggs about {{SI|12|inch|c|long=yes}}. The hatchlings stayed with the female until they'd achieved subadulthood.

===Habitat===
Cobra dragons dwelt in tropical and subtropical climates and made their lairs underground in caves or caverns, while they had no liking for swamps. They lived in southern [[Kara-Tur]], with some in the southernmost parts of [[T'u Lung]], where they caused much destruction and misery, and were more common in the regions further south and west.

===Lair===
As many dragons did, a cobra dragon claimed a territory around its laid and viciously forced out every other creature and intruder. They only tolerated trespass from fellow cobra dragons, and only then in mating season.

===Relationships===
Adult cobra dragons could be served by small groups of intelligent but leaderless beings attracted by its power, charisma, and cunning and who even worshiped it as a god. Such followers typically included, but were not limited to, [[bakemono]], [[gargoyle]]s, [[lizardmen]], and [[mobat]]s. They were permitted to dwell with the cobra dragon in its territory. Some 60% of adult cobra dragons and older usually had around two to eight followers. These followers were usually heavily equipped to deal with the dragon's enemies.

==Rumors & Legends==
In certain legends, it was said that special king cobras who reached a great age would change into cobra dragons.
