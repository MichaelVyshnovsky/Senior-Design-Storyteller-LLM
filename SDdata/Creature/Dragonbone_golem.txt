A dragonbone golem was a construct created by utilizing the bones—or even entire skeletons—of dragons and other non-organic material to bind them together.
These constructs were formed utilizing the inherent magic that existed within all dragons. Individuals bones were etched with arcane runes or glyphs that allowed the magic to freely flow throughout its form, then linked together by adamantine bindings, or other similar means.
Like the living dragons from which they were made, dragonbone golems still emanated an aura of doom that instilled terror in nearby creatures.
Like other golems, these creatures did not need to sleep, drink, or eat for sustenance, they could not succumb to exhaustion, nor did they require breathable air. They could not be poisoned, charmed, paralyzed, or petrified. Like their draconic namesakes, they possessed an inherent resistance damage inflicted by adamantine weapons,
Dragonbone golems possessed an animal-level intelligence and were to be extremely obedient to their masters.
When engaged in battle, dragonbone golems slashed with their claws, attempted to pin smaller foes down to the ground, and incapacitated them with their petrifying breath weapon.
The creation of dragonbone golems involved a number of spells, including animate dead, cause fear, and Geas/Quest, cast by a fairly experienced or otherwise proficient spellcaster. Circa the Era of Upheaval, the total cost of material components totaled a sum upwards of 115,000 gp.
The Inquest of Xorvintroth on Abeir created dragonbone golems utilizing clockwork machinery. These golems featured vicious spikes that lined their form and were uniquely studded with green crystals.
