        "mainbody": "| first        =\nWerehyenas were humans in Zakhara who could transform into a hyena-like form.\nMost werehyenas were male and usually had long shaggy hair. The long hair concealed a second mouth located at the base of the skull. Werehyenas went to great lengths to keep this hidden.\nTheir hyena form was usually  long and had golden fur on their back with black fur on their belly and feet.\nWerehyenas had an innate, deep sense of fear towards fires. Because of this, flaming torches were often used to keep them at bay.\nWerehyenas could not be harmed by weapons unless there were magical or constructed of iron. They were also known to be immune to enchantment or charm spells.\nIn human form, werehyenas used their special charm powers to avoid combat. In canine form they attacked with a savage bite that could lock on to a victim.\nWerehyenas traveled in packs of up to a dozen individuals. A dominant male made all of the decisions for the pack. They mated for life, but only with members of their own pack.\nWerehyenas preyed on gullible humans whenever they could. They were also adept scavengers and ate anything they could find to survive.\nBeyond the land of Zakhara, werehyenas could be found in some areas of the Domains of Dread.\nWhile in human form, werehyenas often infiltrated villages and lured victims out to where the rest of their pack was waiting.\n* Batul, one of many werehyenas that were kept as pets by the dao Ynadin.\n* Jakkob, a captured werehyena who fled to Yhep in the Lake of Steam."
