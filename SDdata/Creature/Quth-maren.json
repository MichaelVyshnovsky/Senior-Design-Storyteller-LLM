        "mainbody": "Quth-maren were undead creatures created from flayed corpses by clerics of Kiaransalee.\nWith every scrap of skin flayed from their bodies and their exposed muscles incessantly oozing acidic blood, the quth-maren were hideous creatures. Unlike zombies, quth-maren did not decompose.\nIntelligent adversaries and vicious in groups, quth-maren had a number of abilities that made them disturbing opponents.\nThey had caustic blood that burned those who touched it. Their bodies constantly oozed this caustic blood, so anyone that struck the quth-maren in melee unarmed or with a natural weapon would be harmed themselves. Moreover, a quth-maren could even spit a glob of this blood every so often, causing it to splash over foes near where it landed.\nA quth-maren could rapidly heal from wounds inflicted on it.\nA quth-maren could attempt to command undead in the same manner that an evil cleric could.\nAny living creature that came within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of a quth-maren and met its baleful gaze risked simply cowering in fear at the sight of it.\nIn 1372 DR, Dorina Tsarran seized control of Szith Morcane and ordered the priestesses of Lolth there to be flayed and transformed into quth-marens."
