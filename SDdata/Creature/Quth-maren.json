        "Description": "With every scrap of skin flayed from their bodies and their exposed muscles incessantly oozing [[acid]]ic blood, the quth-maren were hideous creatures. Unlike [[zombies]], quth-maren did not decompose.",
        "Abilities": "Intelligent adversaries and vicious in groups, quth-maren had a number of abilities that made them disturbing opponents.\n\nThey had caustic blood that burned those who touched it. Their bodies constantly oozed this caustic blood, so anyone that struck the quth-maren in melee unarmed or with a natural weapon would be harmed themselves. Moreover, a quth-maren could even spit a glob of this blood every so often, causing it to splash over foes near where it landed.\n\nA quth-maren could rapidly heal from wounds inflicted on it.\n\nA quth-maren could attempt to [[command undead]] in the same manner that an evil [[cleric]] could.\n\nAny living creature that came within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of a quth-maren and met its baleful gaze risked simply cowering in fear at the sight of it.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], [[Dorina T'sarran]] seized control of [[Szith Morcane]] and ordered the priestesses of [[Lolth]] there to be flayed and transformed into quth-marens."
