Bloodhounds were a domestic breed of dog. They were among the largest breeds of dogs and were quite adept at tracking, to the point that they were primarily utilized for this purpose.
Bloodhounds sometimes acted as servants of the halfling god Arvoreen. And members of the Fellowship of Stalkers of the Silent Path typically had a bloodhound companion.
Around 1035 DR, the Hultmark family of Waterdeep owned a pair of vampiric bloodhounds. In their manors kitchen the family kept a jar of dog treats for them that were infused with blood.
A tuft of fur from this breed was needed as a material component to cast the spells locate creature and locate animals or plants.
