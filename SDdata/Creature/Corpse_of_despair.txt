Corpses of despair were a variety of zombie that existed in the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering. They were created by necromancers from the corpses of those that had ended their own lives after being overcome with feelings of despair, loss, and hopelessness.
A corpse of despair was physically distinguished from other zombies by their faces, which bore a frozen look of anguish that they had at the moment of their death. They also bore signs of the means by which they had taken their own life, such as a noose around the neck, signs of poisoning, or slit wrists.
Corpses of despair uniquely emanated a psychic aura of palpable, crushing despair and hopelessness around them that could afflict the minds of living creatures, dazing them, and potentially putting them in a lethal downward spiral unless they resisted the effect. Like other zombies they were resistant to harm from necrotic energy, but vulnerable to radiant energy.
Like most zombies, a corpse of despair was an unarmed combatant that fought to the point of destruction. They lashed out at whatever was closest to them, but focused their fists towards those dazed by their aura of gloom.
Around the late 15 century DR, a human necromancer from the Bleak Academy was operating in Tymanther, in an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke. Deep within a mausoleum at the burial site, the necromancer created a number of corpses of despair through use of the spell undead servitor.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus in the mausoleum, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther.
