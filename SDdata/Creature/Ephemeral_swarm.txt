'''Ephemeral swarms''' were large groups of [[ghost]]ly [[undead]] that had risen from the [[psionics|psychic]] agony and anguish of many small creatures suffering a common, violent death.

==Description==
Ephemeral swarms varied widely in appearance, always corresponding to whatever group of animals had given rise to it. For example, an area in which [[cat]]s died off from a plague or a nest of [[rat]]s killed by a ''[[fireball]]'' would result in an ephemeral swarm of cats and rats respectively.

==Behavior==
All ephemeral swarms sought to inflict upon others pain and suffering, just as they had endured in the moment of their demise. They would especially focus their attention towards those they could recognize as being an agent of their death.

==Abilities==
These swarms of creatures had incorporeal bodies, floated above the ground, and could see in areas of [[darkvision|total darkness]]. In addition, their bites carried with them [[negative energy]], causing those they bit to slowly have their vitality drained away.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Ephemeral swarms existed partially on the [[ethereal plane]]. On the [[Prime Material plane]], they were typically found haunting the [[Underdark]], various dungeons across [[Faerûn]], and the labyrinthian [[sewer]]s of some of Faerûn's oldest cities. Once such city was [[Skuld]], the capital of [[Mulhorand]], which had quite ancient ephemeral cat swarms haunting its sewers.
