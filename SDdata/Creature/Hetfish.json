        "mainbody": "'''Hetfish''', sometimes called '''hotfish''' by sailors, were a species of rarely encountered somewhat intelligent [[fish]], \"wonders of the undersea\".",
        "Description": "Hetfish were small aquatic creatures between {{SI|1'|'\"|long=yes}} and {{SI|3'|'\"|long=yes}} in length. They had a very prominent scale coloration of silver and orange as well as distinct unappealing bumps and boils that covered their entire bodies. Overall, they had a similar body shape to [[piranha]]s but lacked their razor-sharp teeth and underbite.",
        "Abilities": "The main abilities of note were hetfishes' super-heated bodies. The temperature rose beyond {{SI|350|F}}, turning the waters around them into steam. Some hetfish were able to not just boil their opponents via heating the waters but also could set their targets on fire with magical flames. These flames could not be extinguished by any mundane means as long as the target remained surrounded by the swarm. It only could be done via spells such as ''[[quench]]'', or by moving away from the heated beasts.",
        "Behavior": "Hetfish possessed humble intelligence, on par with smartest [[dog]]s or dullest [[gnoll]]s and were attracted to shiny and glittery things, such as [[gem]]s, as well as movement. Their dens could often contain such valuable items as each individual fish at one point or the other, brought a precious stone back into the lair. The fish were intelligent enough to learn that these pretty baubles could often be carried on board ships that sailed through their territories. This often led to hetfish dens attacking and rams mine vessels to get their fins on gems and other shiny items.\n\nHetfish did not have a language or similar ways of communication.",
        "Combat": "Hetfish turned aggressive the moment their den was disturbed, swarming the trespassers. When defending their homes, the entirety of the den entered the conflict. They swarmed around their targets, biting and boiling them alive, and continued to attacks long after the intruder was dead and cooked. These creatures were deadly as their mere presence in the water around the opponents was deadly. The boiling steaming heat could leave blisters when the fish's opponents were as far as {{SI|20'|'\"|long=yes}} away from the den.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Relationships": "Hetfish were known to serve a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[deity]] [[Abbathor]], the Great Master of Greed."
