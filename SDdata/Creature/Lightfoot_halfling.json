        "mainbody": "'Lightfoot halflings''', also known as '''hairfeet''' or '''Luiren halflings''', were the most common type of [[halfling]]s seen in the world, in large part due to their famous wanderlust, which set them apart from the relatively sedentary [[ghostwise halfling|ghostwise]] and [[strongheart halfling]]s.<ref group=\"note\">In 1{{st}} and 2{{nd}} editions, lightfoots were known as \"hairfeet\". The name was changed for 3{{rd}} edition, when ''D&D''<nowiki/>'s halflings were further changed to be less like J.R.R. Tolkien's hobbits. Lightfoots were most comfortable living alongside other cultures, even adopting their cultural practices, right down to their [[deity|deities]].",
        "Description": "The average lightfoot halfling stood around {{SI|3|ft}} and weighed around {{SIrange|30|45|lbs|k}}. Lightfoots displayed the same range of skin tones, hair colors, and eye hues as [[human]]s. Though they were most frequently seen to have brown or black hair and black, brown, or hazel eyes. Their skin also typically had a ruddy complexion.\n\nFacial hair was relatively rare, with men at most sporting long sideburns or the occasional beard, and women sometimes sporting short sideburns. Mustaches were extremely rare. When not adventuring or entertaining others, lightfoots preferred to wear simple, well-made clothing that was comfortable to wear, yet looked attractive, favoring those with bright colors.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|Lightfoot, light hearted. [[Strongheart halfling|Strongheart]], strong footing.|Common saying in the Realms.}}\n\nLightfoots were among the most affable and good-natured halflings. They were typically curious about others and very open to sharing about themselves. Altogether these aspects of their personalities kindled fast courtships and friendships with others. These were often brief, for most lightfoots innately felt a sense of wanderlust that compelled them to not stay in one place for too long. Though lightfoots were very loyal and such relationships were genuine, some felt the way they so deftly parted ways made those friendships disingenuous.\n\nDue to their personalities many races stereotyped lightfoots as being fickle and flighty in nature, being unreliable and easily distracted. However, despite the impression they gave such races, these halflings were very cunning, opportunistic, and resourceful individuals.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Spellcasting": "Lightfoot societies did not invest in magic nearly as much as strongheart halflings, but there were still many spellcasters among them. In terms of [[spell]]s, lightfoots tended to favor those that offered great mobility &mdash; ''[[expeditious retreat]]'', ''[[fly]]'', and ''[[haste]]'' to name a few &mdash; or those that weakened their foes. ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'' and a variety of spells with [[polymorph]]-effects were also common among their spellcasters.\n\nLightfoots that specialized in travel-based magic became known as hin wandermages. In addition to those previously listed travel spells, hin wandermages typically knew the following &mdash; ''[[air walk]]'', ''[[endurance]]'', ''[[ethereal jaunt]]'', ''[[etherealness]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', ''[[gate]]'', ''[[mount (spell)|mount]]'', ''[[open/close]]'', ''[[phantom steed]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', ''[[Refuge (spell)|refuge]]'', ''[[shadow walk]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[teleportation circle]]'', ''[[transport via plants]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', ''[[wind walk]]'', and ''[[word of recall]]''."

        "Varieties": "[[Tallfellow halfling]]s, a variety of lightfoot, were found on both Toril and the planet of [[Oerth]],<ref group=\"note\">In early ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' settings the tallfellows were just one of the three standard subraces of halfling and thus were mentioned in ''Forgotten Realms'' sources on rare occasions. The [[Player's Handbook 5th edition|5{{th}}-edition ''Player's Handbook'']] retconned them as being the ''Greyhawk'' setting's equivalent to the lightfoot. and were noted for being taller than other halflings and [[elf|elven]]-like.{{Cite dragon/59/The halfling point of view|50-51}}",

They often fired [[skiprock]]s from their slings, though were just as likely to toss them by hand. Due to their size, there were many weapons that lightfoots could not wield effectively.\n\n''[[Hornblade (weapon property)|Hornblade]]'' weapons were particularly associated with lightfoot halflings. Common [[magic item]]s used by lightfoots were ''[[bag of holding|bags of holding]]'', ''[[carpet of flying|carpets of flying]]'', ''[[Heward's handy haversack]]''s, any kind of magical [[boots]],"

        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Much like other halflings, lightfoots were an omnivorous people. They loved [[bread]]s, fruits, vegetables, and the occasional [[pheasant]]. They were very skilled at foraging,",
            "Homelands": "Lightfoots typically lived in warm plains. They were, by nature, wanderers, and so could rarely be found tied down to one place for very long. Typically, lightfoot halfling clans moved from one area to another rapidly, staying in one place rarely more than a year or two. There were exceptions to this rule, however, and in spite of their curiosity and adventurousness, some halflings were drawn to their ancestral homeland of [[Luiren]] before its destruction. Others merely settled more permanently in some foreign land, usually human. Still, it could not truly be said that lightfoot halflings had any land of their own; instead, they called the whole world their home.\n\nIn terms of regions beyond Luiren, lightfoot halflings were often found in the lands of [[northwest Faerûn]], areas of the [[Shining South]] just south of the [[Shaar]], in the [[Purple Hills]] of [[Tethyr]], the [[Sword Coast]] They were also the only sub-race of halfling to live in the [[Unapproachable East]].\n\nIn terms of particular nations, lightfoots could be found in eastern [[Aglarond]], eastern [[Amn]], and [[Turmish]]. In northwest Faerûn they were widely scattered in [[human]] cities, particularly [[Everlund]], [[Silverymoon]], and [[Waterdeep]]. In the Sword Coast they were often often in [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Berdusk]], and [[Secomber]]. They were also quite common near the human communities north of Luiren.",
            "Languages": "Lightfoots typically knew how to speak [[Common]] and [[Halfling language|Halfling]]. Those who spent their lives wandering picked up many regional and widely spread languages. Some even knew how to speak [[Elvish]] and [[Goblin language|Goblin]]. The majority of their sub-race as a whole were literate.",
            "Religions": "Like other halflings, the patron [[deity]] of lightfoots was the goddess [[Yondalla]]. Her faith was popular among both sedentary and nomadic lightfoots. The latter also tended to favor the halfling god [[Brandobaris]], as they considered his outlook on life to be realistic and good-humored. [[Cyrrollalee]] was widely popular in later generations, taking to her promises of a new homeland and greater respect from other races.\n\nOut of all halflings, lightfoots were the most likely to worship gods outside of the [[halfling pantheon]].",
            "Relationships": "[[File:Lightfoot halfling warlock.jpg|thumb|''A lightfoot halfling [[warlock]], his shiny ball, and furry [[rat]].'']]\nDue to their wanderlust nature, lightfoots could often be seen dwelling alongside other races. They were adept at fitting into most communities, including elven, [[dwarf|dwarven]], human, and [[gnome|gnomish]]. There they did their best to make themselves seem valuable and welcomed. They were most frequently found living in or around human societies, as the ever-changing nature of that race's societies allowed for easy exploitation.\n\nSome lightfoots assimilated into the communities they settled in, partially or wholly adopting the local majority race's beliefs and views about the world. Those who spent their lives wandering often held an amalgamation of outlooks from the places they had been. But some acted antithetical to how one would expect of them, adamantly retaining their distinctive lightfoot point of view as they saw it as being what set them apart from other races and halfling sub-races."

        "Notable Lightfoots": "* [[Pawldo]], a hero of the [[Darkwalker War]]\n* [[Regis]], one of the [[Companions of the Hall]]\n* [[Sengal]], a feral druid of [[Malar]] afflicted with [[werewolf]] [[lycanthropy]].\n* [[Spider Parrafin]], the reincarnation of Regis",
        "History": "Most lightfoot halflings in the Realms could trace their lineage back to a tribe that ruled a great kingdom in the land of [[Luiren]]. \n\nIn [[-62 DR]], the war chief of a lightfoot tribe in the Luiren forest of [[Lluirwood]] allied with a strongheart hunter named [[Chad]] against the land's local ghostwise. This culminated in the [[Hin Ghostwars]]. Many within the tribe were horrified by the actions taken by Chad and his fellow stronghearts during this conflict. Thus, following the Hin Ghostwars the members of this tribe and a majority of Luiren's lightfoot population emigrated all across [[the North]], [[Northwest Faerûn|Northwest]], and [[Northeast Faerûn|Northeastern]] reaches of [[Faerûn]]. Some scholars speculated that they were unable to find a specific area to call their new homeland, over time culminating in their race's penchant for wandering.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], a group of lightfoots living in the [[Underdark]] city of [[Deepburrow]] allied with [[gold dwarf]] spelunkers to map out an underground passage between the city and the [[Great Rift]]."
