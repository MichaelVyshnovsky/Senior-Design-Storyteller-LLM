        "mainbody": "argantuan spiders, also known as whisper spiders, were the largest variety of hunting spider in the Realms.\nOn average the bodies of these creatures were  long and measured  in diameter. They were covered in black fur, with two gray stripes across their abdomen, and had red eyes.\nThese creatures had a low degree of intelligence, but higher than that of a base animal.\nThese spiders could shoot strands of webbing from their abdomen out to  and could use it to make entrapping nets. They were also very skilled in shaping their webbing into any shape they had ever seen and would do so in order to mislead their prey.\nIn addition, gargantuan spiders had the unique ability to flatten their bodies to become nearly undetectable to prey.\nIn 1372 DR, ShriNeerune Hlaund and other matron mothers in the city of Ched Nasad summoned a gargantuan spider that they lost control of and went on destroy much of the city.\nThese creatures could be found in a wide variety of lands, though typically inhabited forests or caves where they laired in huge webs.\nGargantuan spiders could on rare occasions be encountered in the North."
