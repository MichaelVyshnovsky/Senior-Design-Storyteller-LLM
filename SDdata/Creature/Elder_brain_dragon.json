        "mainbody": "An '''elder brain dragon''' was an [[aberration]] that was formed when an [[illithid]] [[elder brain]] took over the body of a living [[dragon]].",
        "Description": "Elder brain dragons did not require sleep or food for sustenance. Their bodies were imbued with [[psionic]] power.",
        "Abilities": "One significant advantage elder brain dragons held over other elder brains was their mobility. They were not constrained by the physiological limitations of having to remain within a brine pool, protected by their [[mind flayer]] servants and thralls.",

            "Breath Weapon": "Elder brain dragons possessed a unique and horrifying breath weapon. Just as other dragons could breath bursts of flame or jets of acid, elder brain dragons exhaled streams of brine filled with [[Mind flayer#Reproduction|illithid tadpoles]] that easily transformed victims into new mind flayers in short time.{{Cite adventurers league/Fall the Cold Night|23}}"
        },
        "Society": "Due to their mobility, elder brain dragons often served as generals to mind flayer armies.\n\nIf an elder brain dragon was slain, it was possible to set free the [[spirit]] of the dragon whose body was taken over. These spirits were capable of brief empathetic connection before departing for the [[afterlife]].{{Cite adventurers league/Fall the Cold Night|23}}",
