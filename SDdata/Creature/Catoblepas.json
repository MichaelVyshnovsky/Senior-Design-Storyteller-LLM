Here they were, rolling about in the mud like domestic pigs, and showing puppyish affection to a woman whom they would normally kill, instantly and mercilessly! I made some incoherent noises, and finally choked out words of astonishment.''",
        "source": "[[Brother Twick]]",
        "mainbody": "The [[Cormyr]]ean [[Marsh Drovers]] of the [[Farsea Marshes]] were known to have whole herds of domesticated catoplebases. They were domesticated gradually over many generations of breeding, with eldella ferns used to neutralize their ''death rays''.\n\nBoth the aggression and instinctual solitude of the catoblepases was bred out of them by the Drovers, and they did not use their deadly gazes on the farmers since they considered them to be parts of their packs. The catoblepases were also pampered, their trainers regularly combing their furs with wire brushes and polishing their tusks and claws with [[rabbit]]skins. Their feet were equipped with cleats to help them move across the hard surfaces of human villages.\n\nDomesticated catoblepases were often trained to pull plows, uproot trees and serve as beasts of burden. The biggest herd consisted of twenty beasts that often protected the Drovers from raiding by [[orc]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[bullywug]]s. Milking female catoblepases was still a tricky task. They allowed themselves to be milked only after a large meal of two large [[goat]]s or pigs, and only if alone with the milkmaid and outside to enjoy the evening skies. The milking was done once a month.\n\nThe [[Vast Swamp]] was also known to host domesticated catoblepases.\n\n===Other===\nCatoplebases of the Shadowfell were known to accompany the [[Raven Queen]]. Her worshipers often embarked on hunts for catoblepases searching for their deity's [[bless|blessing]], and those who returned from the hunt alive and bearing one's head earned great esteem among their peers. Catoblepases were also considered suitable quarry for the [[Wild Hunt]] by the inhabitants of the [[Feywild]].",
        "Description": "Catoblepases had the large body of a [[buffalo]], which sat atop squat legs that resembled those of a pachyderm. A catoblepas' head resembled that of a warthog, and sat atop an elongated neck that seemed ill-suited for actual support.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1991|468|Catoblepas}}\n\nCatoblepases possessed a scent that reeked of death and famine, not dissimilar to the swamp gas that filled their favored environment. The scent was reminiscent of [[skunk]]'s stench mixed with foul bog vapors.",
        "Behavior": "[[File:Catoblepas 1e.png|thumb|''Catoblepas and stalwart adventurers.''|400x400px]]\nThese monstrous creatures possessed animalistic intelligence, spending most of their time wandering around swampy domains to graze on grass, weed, occasional carrion, or freely-slain adventurer. Whenever the [[Lunar calendar|full moon]] shone, they ventured out further to hunt for meat.",
        "Abilities": "A catoblepas could easily stun prey with its [[mace]]-like tail, whipping it around incredible speeds. which rotted away the flesh of creatures caught in it and affected the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]], [[Astral Plane|Astral]], and [[Ethereal plane]]s simultaneously. Thankfully, the beast's neck was weak and it took a catoblepas significant effort to raise its head and gaze upon opponents.",
        "Combat": "When several catoblepases were locked in combat, they cooperated and tried to herd the targets into the crossfire of their ''death rays''. However, catoblepases were intelligent and opportunistic enough to size groups of [[humanoid]]s up instead of blindly attacking them. Unless on a hunt, desperate for food, or defending their youth, catoblepases did not attack groups of [[human]]s or other humanoid creatures. Furthermore, catoblepases learned from their previous mistakes and encounters.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "The biggest concentration of catoplebases in the Realms was in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]], or occasionally in some of the marshes or peat bogs of [[High Moor]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. They also dwelled in the [[Rat Hills]], by [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|13}}\n\nOutside of [[Toril]], catoblepases could be found on the worlds of [[Aebrynis]], [[Krynn]], and [[Oerth]], as well as the [[Domains of Dread]] and the [[Shadowfell]]. Some shadow beast catoblepases could travel between worlds and spread death and they were difficult to destroy since after death, they reformed back in the Plane of Shadow."

        "Biology": {
            "Diet": "The catoblepas diet consisted mostly of swamp vegetation, carrion, and the occasional slain adventurer. [[Fish]], swamp [[bird]]s, [[eel]]s, [[water rat]]s, large amphibians, [[snake]]s, and other swamp animals were their typical prey.\n\nCatoblepases also found eldella ferns to be delicious and, if lightly toasted and fed to these beasts, neutralized the ''deathray'' for 24 hours.",
            "Reproduction": "They mated for life and lived in solitude, with a mate, or raising an occasional singular calf. Catoblepase parents were extremely protectives of their offspring and attacked any creatures that approached the calves.\n\nMale and female catoblepases raised the young cooperatively. A calf reached maturity in nine years. Female catoblepases birthed a single calf every 10-12 years.",
            "Usage": "The flavorful [[Death Cheese|death cheese]] sold by [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] was made by using catoblepas milk gathered by blind monks. It could be found for sale in the markets of [[Eagle Peak]]. Surprisingly enough, all catoblepas products were nutritious and delicious, including raw milk and meat.\n\nCatoblepas horns were valued at 30 [[gp]]. Other parts of catoblepas were used by [[wizards]], such as eyes, heart, and brain. These farmed ''[[spell component]]s'' were sold in the markets of [[Eagle Peak]] and [[Proskur]].\n\n[[Lynx eye]] gem could be dissolved in catoblepas tears to create a base used for all healing or [[necromancy|necromantic]] [[potion]]s, or in brewing such substances as ''[[Keoghtom's ointment]].''"

        "History": "[[File:Inquisitive catoblepas.png|thumb|''Closeup of catoblepas's warthog-like head.''|390x390px]]\nA horrific catoblepas dwelt in a foul-smelling muckhole in the [[Temple of Orcus]] in the [[Underdark]] below the [[Bloodstone Pass]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn [[1366 DR]], three riders of Lord [[Cleedis]]'s and [[Janol Famisso]]'s squadron were felled by a deadly catoblepas during the ride towards [[Ankhapur]].\n\nRumors of catoblepas-mounted [[lizardfolk]] raiders menacing the eastern edge of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] along the [[High Road]] reached the worried ears of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. The dangers and raids on the road were true, but the tales regarding the catoblepas were never confirmed.{{Cite dungeon/69/Slave Vats of the Yuan-ti|11}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Catoblepases were popular subjects of stories and legends due to their fearsome and dangerous nature, their silhouettes used in heraldry to symbolize death or doom. It was believed that the first catoblepases were created by a [[Netherese]] [[Arcanist|archmage]], though others claimed that these monstrosities were created by gods of rot and pestilence as symbols of their divine influence. Locals considered it to be an ill omen when one of these creatures established a lair nearby, though these claims of misfortune were just superstitions.\n\nOther tales said that individuals of the impure heart could tame catoblepases. These stories were spawned by the fact that [[warlock]]s, [[death knight]]s, and even [[hag]]s were known to domesticate the beasts and use them as mounts, with some legends also claiming that hags raised these creatures like cattle and fed on their [[milk]]. Certain degenerate creatures intentionally inhabited areas dangerously close to catoblepas territories, often with the intent of going unnoticed."
