        "mainbody": "Satyrs, also known as fauns or the Free Folk, were fey creatures that delighted in singing, dancing, feasting, and debauchery.\nSatyrs looked like male humanoids of stout build, with fur-covered lower bodies and legs and cloven hooves similar to those of a goat. Similarly, goat-like horns topped their heads these came in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small nubs to big curling ones akin to a ram. They were typically seen with facial hair and wild, curly heads of hair that ranged in length. Younger satyrs tended to keep their hair short, while older satyrs would just let it grow until it hung about their shoulders.\nThey had only a male sex, as female satyrs was a phenomenon that just never naturally occurred.\nSatyrs were well known for being curious and incredibly hedonistic. They were willing to go to any length to achieve their desires, giving little thought to the results of their actions, and often roped other creatures into participating in debauchery.\nWhen facing a foe, satyrs were typically known to fight with either a shortsword, shortbow, or longbow. Their most notable weapon was a set of pan pipes that induced a variety of magical effects on their enemies, including charming, frightening, and lulling them to sleep. Other satyrs were immune to the effects of these pipes.\nWhen weapons were not available in close quarters situations they often would simply ram their opponents with their heads.\nDue to their hedonistic nature, satyrs were known to frequently join in the celebration of holidays regardless of what they were for.\nSatyrs in elven woods were known to believe that it was lucky to see a dragon when it was raining.\nBeing an all-male race, the satyrs required mating with other creatures in order to reproduce. These creatures were specifically their fellow fey, the dryads, nymphs, and oreads. They also shared the dryads affection for humans of the opposite sex. Such pairings were likely to result in a child that was a half-fey human, rather than a true satyr.\nAreas in the Realms where satyrs were known to be found included the following\n* North Faerûn the Border Forest. They once dwelt in Brynwood in the Vast, but came into conflict with the local korreds over territory. In the ensuing strife, both races fell before monstrous creatures. Afterwards, few of the satyrs remained. \n* Northeast Faerûn the forests of Rashemen. \n* Northwest Faerûn the High Forest, a pair of mountains in those woods known as the Lost Peaks, Neverwinter Wood, and in Westwood.\n* Interior Faerûn they could be found in Chondalwood, particularly its northern reaches. There they regularly patrolled the Old Road in an attempt to ward off human caravans and travelers. They were allied with centaurs and wood giants that also inhabited the forest.\n* West Faerûn the Cloak Wood.\nSatyrs were sometimes utilized as messengers or agents for the gods Erevan Ilesere, Hanali Celanil, Mielikki, Sharess, Sheela Peryroyl, Silvanus, and Sune.\nSatyrs were often known to serve unicorns whenever one dwelled within their forest.\n* Due to their hedonistic love of alcohol there were many taverns named for them, such as the Saucy Satyr Club,, the Sated Satyr, the Silly Satyr,, and the Smiling Satyr.\n* In his prophecies, the sage Alaundo gave the moniker \"Year of the Stalking Satyr\" to the year of 1179 DR."
