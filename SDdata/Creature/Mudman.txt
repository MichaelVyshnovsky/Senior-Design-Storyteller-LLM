'''Mudmen''' (also spelled "'''mud-men'''") were monsters that spontaneously formed in pools of mud where large amounts of magical auras were concentrated.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some sages believed that if powerful magical [[artifact]]s were left unfound for long enough periods of time in watery environments, they would inevitably form larger and larger mudmen to defend them. mudmen had even been reported in the [[Raging Reef]]!

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
In [[Northwest Faerûn]], some were known to dwell within the [[Mere of Dead Men]].{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, "the Black Death"|53}} Though the largest collection of mudmen in [[Faerûn]] had formed in the [[Bay of Chessenta]]. North of the city of [[Soorenar]], at least forty had formed, with still more than that reported along the [[Akanamere]]. Other mudmen "colonies" were found south of [[Unthalass]], in the [[Alamber Sea]] north of [[Delgora]], east of [[Lyrabar]], in [[Starmantle Bay]] west of [[Amry]], and spread in isolated spots within the [[Easting Reach]].

In [[Calimshan]], underneath the second falls of [[Two Falls River]], so many magic items had been dropped by people trying to cross the muddy and slippery path under the falls that mudmen began defending the items.

Some were also known to be found in [[Maztica]].
