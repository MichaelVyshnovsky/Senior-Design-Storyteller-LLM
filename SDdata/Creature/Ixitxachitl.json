Their surrounding environment were often left devoid of all plant and wildlife.\nGroups were led by the strongest among them through intimidation. This position was most often taken up by ixitxachitl clerics or a vampiric ixitxachitl.\nAll ixitxachitls revered some form of dark power. While some revered the demon lord Demogorgon and considered themselves to be his servants, those in the Sea of Fallen Stars worshiped Ilxendren, the patron god of their race.\nIxitxachitls were largely hated by other aquatic life due to their avaricious behaviors and practice of slavery. They were typically known to wage war for territory and feeding grounds against the sahuagins, locathahs, merfolk, and coastal human settlements. They had an intense rivalry with merrow over which of them were the superior servants of Demogorgon."
