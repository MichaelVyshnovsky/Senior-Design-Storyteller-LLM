        "mainbody": "'''Kir-lanan''', also known as '''black gargoyles''', '''stalkers''', and the '''godless''', were [[gargoyle]]-like creatures that appeared on [[Toril]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "Description": "Appearing similar to the more common gargoyle, kir-lanan had huge [[bat]]-like wings and a muscular [[humanoid]] form that was covered in fine scales. Their skin color generally varied in hues ranging from dark blues and violets to black, although kir-lanan could sometimes be found with skin colors of brown, gray, green, or even dark red. Strikingly, the kir-lanan had hard, pointed teeth and claws with short horns cresting their temples.\n\nAlthough they tended to wrap their bodies in tight cloth&mdash;along with various [[ivory]], metal and stone adornments&mdash;much of their thick skin was typically visible along their arms and wings.",
        "Personality": "Since their arrival in [[1358 DR]], the kir-lanan held an unrelenting enmity towards all [[deities]]. This dislike of the gods was such that the kir-lanan never worshiped any of them and consequently never made use of [[divine magic]].\n\nThey tended to speak [[Common]] and their own language.",
        "Abilities": "Kir-lanans' bodies were infused with [[negative energy]], enabling them to enhance their natural attacks to damage and weaken living creatures. They generally shied away from displays of positive energy, such as a [[cleric]] using their power to ''[[turn undead]]''. They themselves had an ability to [[rebuke undead]], but were completely incapable of casting [[Divine magic|divine spells]] or utilizing [[magic]] that entailed positive energy.\n\nA kir-lanan could project a beam of energy that debilitated their opponent, much like the spell ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]''.",
        "Combat": "Kir-lanan preferred to attack from the air, and would fight with their claws rather than weapons, although they were sometimes known to enter battle with them. Since negative energy infused their bodies, a mere touch would allow them to administer deadly attacks,",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Kir-lanan were known to occasionally be found in the [[High Forest]] and in the [[Underdark]]."
        },
        "History": "Kir-lanan appeared in [[Faerûn]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}} as a by-product of the deaths of the [[gods]] [[Bane]], [[Bhaal]] and [[Myrkul]]. The divine and negative energy released from these deities' deaths caused several hundred kir-lanan to be spawned into existence.<ref name=LoD3e-p145\"> They existed outside of divine influence, and were actively hostile to all gods and their followers, whom they called \"godslaves.\"\n\nHowever, their hatred made it possible to manipulate them, and gradually they came to form an alliance with and ultimately serve&mdash;ironically&mdash;a deity. They succeeded in coaxing the kir-lanan into service, drawing them in with Shar's doctrine of \"ultimate dissolution.\" By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, all kir-lanan served Shar, with their leaders being those who received her commands and their numbers being scattered across [[Faerûn]] to assist her faithful. Ironically, they had become \"godslaves\" as much if not more so than most other groups.",
        "Notable Kir-lanan": "* [[Ghindul]], leader of the [[Howling Wing]] in [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Phaikkul]], leader of the [[Screeching Wing]] in [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Kzntharris]], an emissary to the church of Shar in [[1372 DR]]."
