        "mainbody": "Ruin elementals were fearsome elementals summoned by ruin chanters to protect their homes.\nRuin elementals were massive earth elementals approximately  tall and  in weight. They were composed of rubble from the ruins they guarded. Over time, this rubble slowly eroded into smaller pieces, so that the oldest ruin elementals appeared to be composed of gravel.\nRuin elementals cared for nothing except protecting the fallen cities and fortresses they were set to guard. When those areas were not threatened, they were relatively benign.\nRuin elementals existed to protect ruins wherever they might be. Thus, these creatures could be found in tundras, deserts, and other hospitable and inhospitable places. Due to their remote dwelling places, they were little more than legends to most of Faer√ªn.\nFactions of the Zhentarim and Red Wizards were known to seek places where ruin elementals might be found, and would pay well for information leading to such places."
