'''Yuan-tillithids''' were hybrid creatures that resulted from the cross-breeding of [[yuan-ti]] and [[mind flayer]]s.

==Description==
A recognizable trait of yuan-tillithids was the presence of [[viper]] heads on their scaled tentacles.

==History==
In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], the city of [[Ss'zuraass'nee]] was known for being home to a considerable population of yuan-tillithids, as a consequence of its long-lasting alliance with the illithids of [[Llacerellyn]].
