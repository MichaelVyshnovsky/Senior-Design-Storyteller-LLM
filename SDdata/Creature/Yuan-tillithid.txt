Yuan-tillithids were hybrid creatures that resulted from the cross-breeding of yuan-ti and mind flayers.
A recognizable trait of yuan-tillithids was the presence of viper heads on their scaled tentacles.
In the midâ€’14 century DR, the city of Sszuraassnee was known for being home to a considerable population of yuan-tillithids, as a consequence of its long-lasting alliance with the illithids of Llacerellyn.
