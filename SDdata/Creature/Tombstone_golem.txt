Tombstone golems were a deathtouched variant of stone golems with their bodies composed of the stone of various fused together tombstones and necrotic energy.
These constructs lacked a stone golems ability to slow other creatures, but in its place had a supernatural ability comparable to the spell slay living. Additionally, they could inflict baneful doses of necrotic energy upon living creatures they touched. And if destroyed, their bodies would violently explode, sending out shards of stone and a burst of necrotic energy. 
Much like a standard stone golem, these constructs relied heavily upon their fists to harm the opposition.
On average, building a tombstone golem required the spell slay living and around approximately 70,000 gold pieces.
Around , a group of adventurers traveled through a portal beneath the city of Myth Drannor, taking them into Shazryls tower in the Shadowfell. There they encountered a great number of creatures under the alhoons command, including a trio of forsaken shells that guarded a room alongside a tombstone golem.
