''Where the vultures and gorcraws have come to feed,''<br/>
''Then comes the herald, tabard all bright, revealed''<br/>

==Description==
These birds appeared as crosses between [[crow]]s and turkey [[vulture]]s or buzzards.{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/02-25 - Gorcraws III}} Most gorcraws, about the size of a sparrow, could only squawk.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|106|6}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-02-12 - Gorcraws}}

==Behavior==
Gorcraws were rapacious, but slow and slothful. Though not very smart, they were not stupid, either: they were impatient if anything, unlikely to wait for prey to die, preferring to fly off and seek it elsewhere. These animals were known to eat young of the same species.

Gorcraws were known to love the taste of blood and [[sarsson]] mixed together.{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/07-28 - Realmspeak Terms}}

==Abilities==
According to people familiar with the matter, a gorcraw was close enough to a dire crow.{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/02-25 - Gorcraws II}}

==Combat==
Gorcraws hunted, like shrikes did, when they were desperate, but they were not agile fliers and made for poor birds of prey. They generally avoided any creature larger than themselves or humans, as they were nearly defenseless against farmers, or even children. They didn't get close around anyone with a large stick, recognizing those as sufficient to injure or kill them.

==Ecology==
Gorcraws were carrion birds, and occasionally hunters.

==History==
The word "gorcraw" originated in [[Sembia]], and may have been occasionally mixed up with the close-sounding [[gorscraw]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-02-12 - Gorcraws}} Some reported the name as deriving from its appearance being so close to that of a "noisy black crow".

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], gorcraws lived in [[Marsember]], and in the [[Storm Horns]].
