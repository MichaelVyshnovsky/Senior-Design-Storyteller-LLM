They could also teleport up to . They were immune to damage inflicted by the cold.\nIcelings possessed low-light vision and were known to speak the Common language.\nIcelings were mischievous but cruel, and their sense of humor was better described as dark and dangerous.\nIcelings preferred to rely on their speed in combat, using their claws in hit-and-run attacks.\nIcelings commonly served more powerful winter fey as servants and spies.\nSome rumors claimed that all icelings served the archfey Koliada, the Winter Witch, even those who ostensibly served other fey."
