'''Flamelings''' were small [[elemental vermin]] native to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] that could also be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Description==
These creatures resembled small alligators. Their forward-facing eyes were bulbous and a crown of tentacles surrounded their head. The tentacles served as sensory organs. A flameling's body was covered with red scales. Their club-shaped tail was used for defense.

==Ecology==
Though they were weak [[fire elemental]]s, flamelings could still manipulate fire and were inherently immune to that element. When threatened, flamelings could toss miniature ''[[fireball]]<nowiki/>s'' at their assailants.

They consumed any flammable material as a food source.

==History==
In the ancient city of [[Cursrah]], flamelings were used to incinerate the city's trash.
