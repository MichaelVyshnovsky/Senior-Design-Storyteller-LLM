Flamelings were small elemental vermin native to the Elemental Plane of Fire that could also be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These creatures resembled small alligators. Their forward-facing eyes were bulbous and a crown of tentacles surrounded their head. The tentacles served as sensory organs. A flamelings body was covered with red scales. Their club-shaped tail was used for defense.
Though they were weak fire elementals, flamelings could still manipulate fire and were inherently immune to that element. When threatened, flamelings could toss miniature fireballs at their assailants.
They consumed any flammable material as a food source.
In the ancient city of Cursrah, flamelings were used to incinerate the citys trash.
