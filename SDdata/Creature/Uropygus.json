        "mainbody": "A uropygus, also known as a giant whip scorpion, giant pedipalp, monstrous uropygid, or occasionally giant vinegaroon, was a very rare and dangerous creature, mainly found in the Underdark.\nUroypgi were the largest type of pedipalpi. They had spiny bone-armored pincers and feelers like the smaller types, but also had tails which resembled the stinger of a scorpion. It was sometimes called a giant vinegaroon due to its acidic spray.\nUropygi fought with their two pincers and vicious bite. They could execute a gripping attack, and if the opponent could not escape it, they crushed and held in place for a series of bites.\nAs well as using their appendages, these creatures were also able to release poison gas thrice a day. The yellow, sultry and acrid gas would expand around a 20 radius sphere and those within would uncontrollably spasm and tremor."
