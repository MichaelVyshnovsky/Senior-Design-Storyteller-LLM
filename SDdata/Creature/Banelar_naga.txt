'''Banelar nagas''' (also simply called '''banelars'''

==Description==
Their eyes had a green tint to them, and their scales were a greenish purple, but they had brown tails tipped with stingers. Around their mouths were weak yet agile tentacles which they used to wield [[wand]]s, [[amulet]]s, [[ring]]s, [[rod]]s, [[potion]]s, and other small [[magic items]].

They could breathe in either air or water.

==Personality==
Banelars were at once cruel, aggressive, arrogant, and majestic. They faced any threat head-on, haughtily confident in their ability to tackle it.

Their voices had a hissing aspect to them, and they spoke the [[Common]], [[Orcish]], and [[Draconic language|Draconic]] languages,

==Combat==
[[File:Banelar1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''A banelar wielding a magic [[wand]] with one of its tentacles.'']]
Banelar nagas' tails had venomous stingers on them, with the [[poison]] causing a target's skin to turn blue. In addition to this natural weapon, they favored fighting with [[spell]]s, mainly from the [[evil domain|Evil]], [[water domain|Water]], and [[Magic domain]]s. They also used a variety of magical items to complement this, holding them with their tentacles.

Banelars also had access to a number of [[Divine magic|divine spells]], and by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], empowered by the god [[Bane]], they had gained a number of verbal powers. Using just their mighty utterances, they were able to stun, rebuke, and even push back enemies with the power of their forceful words. Their preferred tactic was to daze more dangerous opponents while charging in to deal with weaker ones.

==Society==
Banelar nagas followed Bane, with [[Cyric]] being a less-favored god with whose priests they worked following Bane's apparent death.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==History==
Banelars were created to serve Bane, and historically they did so either directly through his [[Church of Bane|church]] and the Zhentarim, or independently in his name. It was from this longstanding relationship with Bane and his followers that they received their name "banelar."

Following Bane's death in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, many banelars defected to work with followers of Cyric. Within the Zhentarim, this meant they sided against the Baneson, [[Iyachtu Xvim]], and the former [[Chosen of Bane]], [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

==Notable Banelar Nagas==
