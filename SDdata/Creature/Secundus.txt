'''Secundi''' were the most powerful of hierarch [[modron]]s. They were second in power only to [[Primus]] itself.

==Description==
Secundi appeared like very thin and tall humanoids, with long faces and deep-set eyes.

==Combat==
If forced into combat, secundi used a combination of innate abilities, spells, fists, and psionics.

==Abilities==
Like all hierarch modrons, secundi had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Secundi were able to cast [[arcane]] spells as well as [[divine]] spells from the [[Law domain|Law]], [[Protection domain|Protection]] and [[War domain|War]] domains. Secundi were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.

==Society==
There were only four secundi in modron society. They could communicate with other secundi and relayed their orders to [[tertian]]s under their command, but reported directly to [[Primus]] itself. Each secundus was a viceroy in charge of one of the four quarters of their realm in [[Mechanus]]. They could communicate  telepathically with anyone in a {{SIAdj|420|mile|k}} radius.

Secundi were always created as the result of a [[tertian]] being promoted to take the place of a killed or further promoted secundus. If [[Primus]] died, one of the secundi was promoted and took its place as the new Primus.{{Cite web enhancement/The Modrons|2-3}}

==Ecology==
Secundi were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within {{SI|420|mi|k}} and could see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}.

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-346}}, [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[archmage]] and explorer Lady [[Polaris]] came upon Mechanus and the modrons. She [[Gate|summoned]] several [[decaton]]s to her home to guard her treasures, but was stymied as they kept disappearing after several days. She suspected that a secundus was behind the disappearances as a form of extraction, and later had more sucess with the [[pentadrone]]s she focused on next.<ref><br/>

After [[Orcus]] killed Primus and triggered an unexpected [[Great Modron March]], he left the [[Energy Pool]] in [[Regulus]] to search for the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]'', leaving the way open for a secundus to be promoted into the new Primus. However, prolonged contact with the Pool caused Orcus's [[evil]] influence to taint a fraction of the modrons. One tainted secundus disputed the ascension of any one of the other three and demanded that the successor be chosen by a rite of challenge: the successor would be the one who slew the largest number of [[chaos|chaotic]] creatures.{{Cite dragon/354/Return of the Modrons|36}}

The challenged secundus proceeded to [[Limbo]] and killed vast numbers of [[slaad]]i, but the tainted one ordered an army of modrons to invade [[Bytopia]] and destroy entire settlements of [[gnome]] [[petitioner]]s. Once his treachery was discovered, in particular the breaking of the rules that involved the secundus not slaying creatures with his own hands and not destroying creatures diametrically opposed to pure [[law]], the two remaining secundi denied him victory in the challenge. The enraged tainted secundus left Mechanus, taking almost a million modrons with him, and settled a modron colony in [[Acheron]]. This schism crippled the modron race and paved the way for a [[formian]] invasion of Mechanus.
