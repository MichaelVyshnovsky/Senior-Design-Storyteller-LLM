The tendriculos was a type of monstrous plant creature whose origins in the Realms were uncertain.
These creatures were mounds of vegetation, supported by various branches and vines. Their masses had a large opening that was filled with sharp branches and horns, acting sort of like teeth. On average they could rear up to a height of  and weighed around .
The tendriculos was best known for possessing an extremely rapid regenerative ability, allowing it to quickly grow and regrow its body, with whole new leaves and vines appearing on it within just a few minutes.
The tendriculos fought by grappling creatures with its large tendril vines and then attempting to swallow them whole.
The tendriculos was a carnivorous species, known to either prowl around their forest habitats for prey or waiting in place until something passed by.
These creatures were typically found in forests of regions with a temperate climate. 
In interior Faer没n they could be found in the forest of Chondalwood. In south Faer没n, they could be found in the Forest of Amtar and the southern reaches of the Lluirwood. In the Unapproachable East, tendriculos could be found in the Forest of Lethyr, the Umber Marshes, and the Yuirwood. In west Faer没n they grew within the ruins of Shoonach.
Following the moon elves departure from it, tendriculos could be found within the Ardeep Forest of northwest Faer没n.
Outside of the Prime Material plane, some could be found in the Domains of Dread, in particular the domain of Hazlik where they grew in the estates garden alongside other monstrous plants. They also grew within the 222 layer of the Abyss.
Animals and even other plant creatures felt a sense of unease around tendriculoses and would try to avoid them, as well as any place they had been within the last twenty-four hours.
Some believed that the tendriculos was the result of mutation by foul magic, while others felt that it may have originated on another plane of existence. Some proposed that its origins may have even been a combination of both theories.
* Gduar kept a tendriculos in their garden that they commanded once every 24 hours to go out and hunt for prey to nourish the gardens fungal colony.
