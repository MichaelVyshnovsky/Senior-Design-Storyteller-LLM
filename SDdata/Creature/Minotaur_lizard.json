        "mainbody": "Minotaur lizards were a rare, gargantuan species of lizard named for the minotaur-like horns atop their heads.\nMinotaur lizards were known to be very aggressive.\nMinotaur lizards fought with their sharp teeth and long sharp claws, often ambushing their prey.\nDuring the 14 century DR, some were known to dwell inside the depths of Undermountain.\nIn the 14 century DR, an alleged prophet living in the Storm Horns was said to use these creatures in their predictions and had trained one of them to do his bidding.\nMinotaur lizards lived largely solitary lives and were most active during daylight hours. Though creatures often feared their horns, they were not known to use them in combat and thus some believed they were a means by which to attract a mate.\nLike many species of large lizard, minotaur lizards were carnivorous.\nMinotaur lizards dwelt in the hills and mountains of tropical regions, often near red dragons and copper dragons.\nThey inhabited various mountains and hills in the land of Maztica, the southern reaches of the Storm Horns,\nBeyond Toril, minotaur lizards could be found on the planet Oerth. Beyond the Prime Material plane, they inhabited the Celestial Bureaucracys plane of Qui.\nHumanoids used the horns of these creatures for a variety of purposes."
