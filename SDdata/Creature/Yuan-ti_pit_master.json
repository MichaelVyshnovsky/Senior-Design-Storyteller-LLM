        "Description": "Yuan-ti pit masters were mostly humanoid in form, but had many snake-body-like tentacles in place of arms.",
        "Personality": "Pit masters were traditionalists who always preferred a slow, cautious approach in any matter and opposed any reckless behavior. They felt that they were the most capable of achieving the goals of the yuan-ti.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|I've met a few [[yuan-ti pureblood|purebloods]] and [[yuan-ti broodguard|broodguards]] in my day, but had I met a yuan-ti pit master, I'm quite sure I'd not be here to tell the tale!|[[Volothamp Geddarm|Volos']] notes in ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]''.}}\nLike other yuan-ti, pit masters were immune to poison and resistant to spells and other magical effects. They could turn into a snake and back at will. Pit masters could also innately cast the spells ''[[animal friendship]]'' at will and ''[[suggestion]]'' thrice each day.\n\nAs priests of Merrshaulk, yuan-ti pit masters knew the cantrips ''[[eldritch blast]]'', ''[[friends]]'', ''[[guidance]]'', ''[[mage hand]]'', ''[[message]]'', and ''[[poison spray]]'', and the spells ''[[command]]'', ''[[counterspell]]'', ''[[hellish rebuke]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[misty step]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', and ''[[vampiric touch]]''. They could only cast two spells each day, however.\n\nAdditionally, once each day a pit master could cause five creatures within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of it that it could see to collapse into a magical sleep for 10 minutes.",
        "Combat": "Pit masters did not use weapons or armor, instead relying on their naturally venomous fangs to deal with enemies.",
        "Society": "Yuan-ti pit masters were priests of the ancient yuan-ti god Merrshaulk, and they sacrificed humanoids to him in order to rouse him from his slumber. They were also heavily involved in the long-term plans of the yuan-ti to take over humanoid governments and also in the efforts to protect their own cities from discovery and attack."
