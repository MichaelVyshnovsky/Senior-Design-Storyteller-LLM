It's difficult to explain, but trust me, you'll still be able to trade there if you wish - and use the [[alchemy]] workbench.''|[[Sand (individual)|Sand]]}}",
        "Description": "Merchant elementals were strange beings that bore an uncanny resemblance to the individual who summoned or created them. They looked like animated and intelligent people made of stone. The elemental was placed on a mage's circle and emitted slight steam.\n\nAn alternative to ''Leomund's merchant elemental'' was ''[[Aphelda's vendor golem]]''. However, the [[golem]] was an utter mercantile pushover.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were stoic, quiet, and behaved like competent store owners, performing all tasks a real shopkeep did on a daily basis. They could purchase, sell, and haggle over the store's stock. Skilled [[wizard]] store keeps could be sure that ''Leomund's merchant elemental'' left in charge of their stores did an adequate job. Those who witnessed ''Leomund's merchant elementals'' claimed that the creatures had understanding and empathetic facial expressions and had a keen business sense.",
        "Ecology": "''Merchant elementals'' were not part of the natural way of things. They did not need to nourish themselves nor needed sleep.",
        "History": "''[[Leomund]]'s merchant elementals'' were extremely rare, and it was unclear if they were summoned creatures or crafted and animated. Those who knew this secret did not feel the need to divulge that information. In the {{yearlink|1374}}, one such creature served [[elf|elven]] shop owner and wizard [[Sand (individual)|Sand]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The elf entrusted his ''merchant elemental'' to run the shop while Sand joined [[Kalach-Cha]] during the [[Shadow War]]."
