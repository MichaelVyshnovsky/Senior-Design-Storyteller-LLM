They looked like animated and intelligent people made of stone. The elemental was placed on a mages circle and emitted slight steam.\nAn alternative to Leomunds merchant elemental was Apheldas vendor golem. However, the golem was an utter mercantile pushover.\nThese creatures were stoic, quiet, and behaved like competent store owners, performing all tasks a real shopkeep did on a daily basis. They could purchase, sell, and haggle over the stores stock. Skilled wizard store keeps could be sure that Leomunds merchant elemental left in charge of their stores did an adequate job. Those who witnessed Leomunds merchant elementals claimed that the creatures had understanding and empathetic facial expressions and had a keen business sense.\nMerchant elementals were not part of the natural way of things. They did not need to nourish themselves nor needed sleep.\nLeomunds merchant elementals were extremely rare, and it was unclear if they were summoned creatures or crafted and animated. Those who knew this secret did not feel the need to divulge that information. In the , one such creature served elven shop owner and wizard Sand of Neverwinter. The elf entrusted his merchant elemental to run the shop while Sand joined Kalach-Cha during the Shadow War."
