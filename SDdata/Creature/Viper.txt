A viper was a common type of snake that varied greatly in size and appearance.
Vipers were not especially aggressive, but would bite if they felt threatened before trying to slither away. They were solitary predators.
Vipers used their bites and venom to kill prey and defend themselves. This venom harmed a victims health.
In 1374 DR, the Shadowscale lizardfolk placed captured small black vipers inside sealed clay pots, which they would then hurl as grenades at their foes. The hungry and angry snake would then attack the nearest living being, ignoring the undead Shadowscales. A snake of this kind could be spawned once per day by use of a costly viper dagger.
