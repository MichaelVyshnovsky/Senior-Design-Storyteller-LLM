In the late 14 century DR, the Year of Sorrow and Hope of the Malatran calendar, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle entered an ancient ruined city Donen on the Malatran Plateau. The settlement had been destroyed countless centuries in the past, and its inhabitants, the Ancients, were long gone. The adventurers were accompanied by a spelljamming arcane traveler named Lriyt. The group encountered a massive elder boalisk serpent who had been alive since the days of the Donens golden age. The creature was intelligent and did not tolerate invaders into its ruined domain. Later, Lriyt revealed that the boalisk once was nothing but a tiny snake that lived in the city of the Ancients.
