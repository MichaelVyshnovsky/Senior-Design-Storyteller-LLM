        "mainbody": "Phanes were abominations lost in time unwanted offspring of deities of fate or time.\nPhanes were shadowy and insubstantial, seemingly made of coalesced mist, with the body and legs of a great hunting cat and the torso and arms of a humanoid. They were said to move with a feline grace even though their bodies seemed to barely hold together.\nPhanes were destructive and chaotic.\nPhanes, like other abominations, were powerful and possessed of a wide array of abilities. Akin to other godforsaken abominations, they were immune to polymorph, petrification, and other form-altering spells and effects damage caused by energy or health drain and anything that effected the mind, such as charms, compulsions, or phantasms. They were resistant to fire and cold, and were otherwise difficult to damage. They resisted detection as if constantly under the nondetection spell. Abominations possessed blindsight with a range of  and truesight. They were known to speak the Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal languages they also could telepathically communicate with creatures within  of theirself, as long as that creature also spoke a language.\nPhanes also possessed a variety of innate spell-like abilities, being able to replicate the effects of detect good, detect magic, and improved invisibility at will haste, mass haste, slow, teleport without error, tongues, trap the soul, true strike, and unholy aura all five times per day each safe time and time duplicate each twice per day and time stop once each day.\nPhanes were far better known for their myriad powers over the flow of time they passively radiated a \"null time field\" for  around themselves that could trap objects and creatures as if in temporal stasis and even for those objects and creatures that went uneffected, they could induce it even more powerfully by touch.\nPhanes could also make a ranged attack in the form of creating a space-time flux against any creature within  of them. They also could \"feed\" upon the \"future\" of any creature it had successfully trapped in temporal stasis, though this ability was poorly understood. Even stranger reports spoke of them regressing through time and summoning past duplicates of their foes that, though possessing the knowledge of the original, still served the phane loyally. Other accounts spoke of them causing their enemies to age rapidly, effecting dazing and weakening the foe greatly, and shifting back in time to remove ill effects set upon itself.\nPhanes favored using time duplicate to summon a duplicate of themself to set upon foes, sowing chaos and confusion before the actual phane attacked using its time-stopping abilities. If threatened, phanes would flee by way of teleport without error.\nPhanes were exceptionally rare and strange, with most of them trapped in prisons outside of the normal time stream. However, some escaped into the time stream seeking to feed, or in the case of more ambitious individuals, alter the fates of entire nations, worlds, even planes. Such escapees normally prowled the Astral Sea, and accounts spoke of them allying with creatures as varied as sorrowsworn, nightwalkers, demons, devils, and fey- anything powerful and destructive."
