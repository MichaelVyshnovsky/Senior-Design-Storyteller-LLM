        "mainbody": "OrangutansThe real-world orangutan derives its name from the Malay words orang \"person\" and hutan \"forest\". On Toril, the name likely derives from the equivalent language Lidahan, which is known to share the the first of these two words. were arboreal solitary apes.\nUnsociable by nature, adult orangutans were nearly exclusively encountered alone in the wild. Exceptions to this were mothers still raising their young, who were sometimes accompanied by a single male consort. This tendency to stay alone extended to humanoids, by whom orangutans disliked being approached or followed, and any attempts at contact made with speak with animals were most likely met with irritated evasion. Some male orangutans would even be outright hostile to those who invaded their privacy, even though the species was typically not aggressive.\nDespite their solitary nature, some jungle-dwelling rangers had orangutan followers that could handily be trained.\nOrangutans knew their surroundings well, and were especially familiar with their local fruit trees, sometimes to such an extent that some males weighed too much to swing through the trees and had to traverse the forest floor instead.\nOrangutans were found in the jungles of Kara-Tur."
