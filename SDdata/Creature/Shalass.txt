The '''shalass''', sometimes referred to as the '''silver shalass''', was a type of fish endemic to [[the North]].{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}}

==Description==
The shalass bore a resemblance to [[trout]], were covered in silver scales, and on average grew to be {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Ecology<!--(use for animals)-->==
These fish were considered to be a delicacy throughout the North.

According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], they were best caught in a particular type of fish basket known as a cone net. However, expert fisherfolk were known to simply stab them with [[spear]]s from a bank or raft.
===Habitats===
The shalass were primarily known to inhabit the [[Dessarin River]]. and [[Laughingflow]].

==Trivia==
* The [[Red Rune Inn]] was claimed by many to make the finest shalass stew in all of [[Faerun]].
