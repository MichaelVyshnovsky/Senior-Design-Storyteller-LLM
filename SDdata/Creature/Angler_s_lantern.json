        "Description": "These creatures were named for their highly bioluminescent organs, which made it easier to spot them during the night.",
        "Ecology": "Angler's lanterns were believed to be active at any hour of the day, but it was hard to confirm this, owing to the difficulty of spotting them during daylight hours."
