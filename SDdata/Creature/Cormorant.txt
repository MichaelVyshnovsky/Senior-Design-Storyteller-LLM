'''Cormorants''', also called '''sea-skry''', were dark-feathered raucous [[bird]]s that dwelt in the costal areas and fed by diving for fish.

==Ecology==
Even though both, [[sea gull]]s and cormorants were foul-tasting fowl, in the village of [[Ulgoth's Beard]], these sea birds were often brought down with well-placed stone throws as they dived for fish. These birds were then boiled with several types of local vegetables, such as [[leek]]s, [[thrae]], [[durfist]]s, and seasoned generously. This local greasy stew was called [[gudgeon]].

In the eastern realm of [[Kara-Tur]], cormorants were sometimes trained by fishers to retrieve fish for their masters. These cormorants were outfitted with [[silver]] rings around tier necks to prevent the birds from swallowing their prey.

Cormorants and [[black egrets]] plagued the [[Farsea Marshes]] of [[Cormyr]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], a [[human]] [[barbarian]] from Kara-Tur, [[Yu Fu Fang]] used trained cormorants to fish in the waters of [[Hungtse River]].
