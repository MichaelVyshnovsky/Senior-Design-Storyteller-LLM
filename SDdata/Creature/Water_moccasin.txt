Water moccasins were a rather common species of poisonous snake.
In Faer√ªn, they were known to be found in parts of the Sword Coast and in the Flooded Forest in the Vast.A name is never given in The Stars Dont Lie for the swamp that the players travel through in the adventure, but its stated to be quite large and within six days of travel from Ravens Bluff. As there is no other significant swamp known to be proximity to the city, the Flooded Forest is most likely the location. In Kara-Tur they were known to be found on Miyashima, a small lake-bound island on the larger island of Shinkoku.
