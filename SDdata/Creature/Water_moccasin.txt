'''Water moccasins''' were a rather common species of poisonous [[snake]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
In [[Faer√ªn]], they were known to be found in parts of the [[Sword Coast]]<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Murkos Mission|16}} and in the [[Flooded Forest]] in the [[Vast]].{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stars Don't Lie|10}}<ref group="note" name="unnamed">A name is never given in ''The Stars Don't Lie'' for the swamp that the players travel through in the adventure, but it's stated to be quite large and within six days of travel from Ravens Bluff. As there is no other significant swamp known to be proximity to the city, the Flooded Forest is most likely the location. In [[Kara-Tur]] they were known to be found on [[Miyashima]],<ref>{{Cite dungeon/33/Mad Gyoji|59}} a small lake-bound island on the larger island of [[Shinkoku]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/33/Mad Gyoji|54-56}}
