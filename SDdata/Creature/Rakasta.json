        "Description": "Rakasta were humanoids with feline features who walked on their legs in a manner similar to that of [[human]]s but showing grace and fluidity in their movements. Their bodies were covered in soft fur of orange-brown, light tan, or dark brown colors. They had feline heads and bright green feline eyes with vertical pupils. They had furry nonprehensile tails from {{SI|4'|'\"|long=yes}} to {{SI|6'|'\"|long=yes}} long. Rakasta heights carried from {{SI|5'|'\"|long=yes}} to {{SI|7'|'\"|long=yes}}.\n\nApart from the most common rakasta breed, called a \"basic rakasta\" or \"moggie,\" there existed a multitude of rakasta breeds found in different parts of Mystara and different worlds or planes. Each breed had its own distinct feline appearance, size, physical and mental traits, and various levels of fear of water. Generally, across all breeds, males were larger than females.{{Cite dragon/Rakasta of Mystara|27-28}}",
        "Personality": "[[File:Run Rakasta run.png|thumb|''A dynamic rakasta.''|356x356px]]\nRakasta were proud nomads and barbarians, many of whom were peaceful warriors who retaliated swiftly if provoked.\n\nAll rakasta breeds were also great at hiding and concealing themselves, even the larger breeds. Just like domestic cats, rakasta were affected by [[catnip]]. The plant was hard to resist, prompting rakasta to compulsively roll around in catnip and rub it all over in a state of ecstasy.",
        "Abilities": "All rakasta breeds that belonged to the \"greater rakasta\" group had the ability to emit a great terrifying roar that could affect their opponents. Another notable ability of all rakasta breeds was granted to them by their feline physiology. All rakasta except for the basic rakasta but \"moggies,\" was their feline physiology that allowed them to tense their muscles like a fine spring, releasing it in a burst of strength. In order to have energy for such feats, rakasta had to sleep for 12 hours each day and supplement it with regular catnaps. Being deprived of the long sleep left them unable to focus such bursts of strength and could result in physical weakness, and dimmed mental acuity. Non-adventuring rakasta normally slept 16 hours a day. Sleeping rakasta were not defenseless. They had a highly sensitive sleep that kept them alert to even the most muffled suspicious sound. They were hard to surprise during rest, and rakasta were not disturbed by snoring companions, howling wind, or any other type of white noise.\n\nRakasta whiskers were an important sensory organ that granted them ''vibrissae'', a natural boost to dexterity through air-current detection. If their whiskers were damaged, it affected rakasta's nimbleness and agility until the whiskers grew back within one to four weeks.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Rage of the Rakasta.jpg|thumb|''A rakasta, pouncing [[kasa]]s-first.''|400x400px]]\nWhen provoked, rakasta were fearsome warriors rarely using normal weapons. They needed no tools when rakasta claws and bites were as deadly as any blade, especially with the claw argumentations coming among these felines. Rakasta wore ''[[kasa]]s'' – a special type of metallic clawed gauntlets. Their back claws were just as dangerous. If a rakasta warrior landed two slashes on a target, they could also land a lightning-fast rending with their rear claws.\n\nThe closest alternative to a cavalry among rakasta were ''hatra'' – warriors who rode [[saber-toothed tiger]]s into battle. ''[[Hatra]]'' were considered to be the bravest and the strongest of the pride as only the most valiant rakasta could commend saber-toothed tigers' respect. ''Hatra's'' saber-toothed tigers were equipped with a special variety of [[saddle]]s designed especially for the cats' leaping abilities. These saddles kept ''hatra'' on the mount's back without a chance of falling off and giving them the ability to use both hands in battle while on the tigerback.\n\nRakasta were also known to keep magical creatures called ebon tigers, using them as guards.",
        "Society": "Rakasta were nomadic people who lived in prides of between six and 60 adults with an additional 25% of the total number of adults being rakasta young, led by a single chief whose word is the absolute law. Additionally, a single rakasta pride could keep up to 12 saber-toothed tigers. Six ''hatra'' always accompanied a pride's chief, keeping them safe. Each pride had at least one [[cleric]] and, on occasion, a [[mage]]. When not moving, the felines erected temporary tent cities of many colorful pavilions.\n\nThe colorfulness of rakasta tent cities was the evidence of their artistry and admirable skills at weaving rugs, [[silk]]s, tapestries, and masterfully crafted and decorated bowls, cups, and other receptacles. Rakasta valued such items of great quality and esthetics more than [[gold]] and [[gem]]s, making their treasuries filled with objects of art and products of master-crafters.\n\nRakasta society valued warriors' prowess and kept their ''hatra'' at the top of the rakasta society. Apart from the chief's words, rakasta followed the ''Sri'raka'', the code of conduct. Some of the tenets dictated by ''Sri'raka'' included the laws of no combat challenge ever to be refused; no wounded to be ever left behind, warriors were to transport the wounded to safety or grant them honorable death; all rakasta strove to die in battle and never in their sleep; no mere would be given to the enemies, and no mercy was to be expected in return; the only time rakasta were allowed to retreat – under orders to regroup and attack again within two sunrises; and lastly, rakasta never surrendered, those who were taken prisoners were not rakasta anymore.\n\nRakasta had their own [[Rakasta language|language]] that carried in dialects depending on the pride's culture. More primitive rakasta prides learned to speak [[Common]] with a thick purring feline accent of rolling r's and hissed s's.",
        "Ecology": "[[File:Rage of the Rakasta 1e.png|thumb|''Rakasta [[warrior]], [[mage]], and [[ninja]].''|549x549px]]\nIn the lands populated by the rakasta, the feline hunters served to control the game herd populations. Those who allied with rakasta earned themselves reliable trading partners.",
        "History": "The history of rakasta on Toril remained unrecorded; however, the rakasta creation myth on the World of Mystara was quite ancient. It was a poem about a clever cat named Ba-steh who fell in love with her human master – Kum-rah, a [[shaman]] who worshipped The Immortal Ka. The cat protected her master and served Ka. Eventually, the deity-like Immortal rewarded the cat with a transformation into a human woman. Ba-steh married Kum-rah. Subsequently, Ka tested the couple by sending out a [[mouse]] to Kum-rah's cave shrine. Ba-steh followed her instincts and pounced on the rodent, killing it. The shaman witnessed his wive's animalistic behavior in dismay. Ka was upset with the test's outcome. The Immortal wanted to transform Ba-steh back into a cat but realized that it would be cruel, and instead, he transformed both lovers into cat-folk, the first rakasta.{{Cite dragon/Rakasta of Mystara|26}}\n\nAfter Kum-rah's ninth death, Ba-steh was given a place by Ka's side to distract her from pain and grief. She learned to use magic, discovered the [[Outer Planes]], and eventually left Ka behind on a quest for knowledge across the universe and achieved immortality. By the time Ba-steh left Mystara, she had already had countless children. As a final gift to her, Ka transformed the most loyal cat followers of his into rakasta, effectively creating a new race that spread to a Mystaran moon – Patera, which became the largest rakasta empire in all the stars. According to the legends, Ba-steh traveled across the planes and time and eventually found a world where she could be worshipped as a deity, becoming [[Bastet]]. Centuries passed, and the civilization that worshipped Bastet collapsed, sending the imp portal feline back to Mystara, where she found her rakasta flourishing, becoming the main Immortal patron of the rakasta people.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of ''hatra'' from a Vastar rakasta tribe found themselves owing much to certain unnamed rakshasa Rajahs. In turn, the Rajahs owed favors to the individual only known as the [[Sewer Lich]], lending the undead service of the indebted ''hatra''. The Sewer Lich used a duo of rakshasas – [[Blevins]] and [[Abdulthe]], and the rakasta as its assassins."
