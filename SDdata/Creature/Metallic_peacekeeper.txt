'''Metallic Peacekeepers''' were the [[humanoid]] variety of [[metallic sentinel]]s, [[construct]]s created by [[metallic dragon]]s to watch over and keep safe weaker beings that the benevolent dragons cared for.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|29}}

==Description==
Like all sentinels, peacekeepers were created from fine, filigreed metal, of the variety associated with their master. Similarly, they were powered by the type of energy associated with their creator's breath weapon.

==Abilities==
These beings possessed an innate, [[telepathic]] bond with their draconic creators. They could communicate in the [[common]] and [[draconic language]]s. This bond could be replicated with another being with the use of a ''[[mimic battery]]''.

==Combat==
Metallic peacekeepers made simple attacks with their fists, but preferred an alternate method to subdue aggrieved foes. They could release a soothing mist in an area with a radius of {{SI|30|ft}} centered upon themself.

Their physical forms could not be harmed by fire or altered in any way, even by magical means.

Like other constructs they were immune to [[charm]] spells and effects, did not succumb to exhaustion, and could not be [[poison]]ed or frightened.

==History==
The [[Abeir]]an [[dragonborn]] [[artificer]]s of the [[Inquest]] maintained a collection of ten metallic peacekeepers within the [[Supreme Forge]] in the city of [[Xorvintroth]].{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|18}}
