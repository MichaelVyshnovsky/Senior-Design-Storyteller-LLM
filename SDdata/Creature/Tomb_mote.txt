'''Tomb motes''' were tiny [[undead]] creatures that resembled [[humanoid]]s created out of clumps of tomb litter and waste.

==Description==
These [[imp]]-like undead beings were spontaneously-risen animated being of bone shards, loose teeth, hair balls, and cracked shards of tombstones and grave dirt. They reached {{SI|1'|'"|long=yes}} in height and weighted from {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}} to {{SI|8|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Abilities==
Tomb motes were carriers of the disease known as [[corpse bloat]]. Each bite landed by these tiny undead creatures could be deadly with the infection's incubation rate taking up to three days to present itself, turning the infected skin green and sprouting feverish bloats.

Tomb motes could comprehend [[Common]] and [[Abyssal]] languages but were unable to speak.

==Behavior==
For creatures of grave dirt, tomb motes were smart, savage, and impishly mischievous. Their behaviors varied from being malicious and evil to being a nuisance to grieving graveyard visitors.

==Combat==
Due to their diminutive size, tomb motes sprang to attack their targets from ambush, preferring to overwhelm them with motes' numbers. Tiny and quick, they relayed on their diseased bites and lightning-quick movements in combat. They took to shadows, avoiding tougher opponents, quickly retreating if met with a creature beyond their swarming attacks' strength..

==Ecology==
Tomb motes were known to spring to unlife in the magic-rich mass burial sites, graveyards, and tombs. Their creation was sparked by places flush with dark [[necromancy]] magic and undead activity.

===Habitats===
Tomb motes were known to haunt the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]] in the years that followed the [[Spellplague]].
