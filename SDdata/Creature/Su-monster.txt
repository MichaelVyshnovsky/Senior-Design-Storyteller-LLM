'''Su-monsters''' ({{Pronounce|SOO|man|sturz|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}}) were evil primate-like creatures with innate [[psionic]] abilities.

==Description==
Su-monsters had gorilla-like heads, attached to a canine physique, with broad chests and thin, tapered waists. Their four prehensile limbs were tipped with sharp nails, which alongside their prehensile tails made them adept climbers. They could suspend themselves upside-down, and often used this to their advantage when hunting for prey.

The creatures had filthy gray fur, black faces, and blood-red paws. They were known to inhabit both underground areas as well as open-air wilderness, 

==Personality==
Evil and chaotic by nature, it was a matter of debate among [[druid]]s whether su-monsters were considered sentient or not. Beseeching his god, [[Silvanus]], the druid [[Newander]] was able to determine the primates as self-aware, and thus fair game to kill.

==Combat==
Su-monsters often lurked hanging upside down while waiting for prey to pass them by.

In addition to fighting using their jaws and extremely sharp nails, su-monsters possessed a limited amount of psionic ability. They were also known to fight by picking up and throwing rocks.

==Society==
Su-monsters were most often found in groups of up to twelve individuals, often forming family units consisting of two adults, one male and one female, along with several offspring. If an individual member of the family was threatened, the other members would fight ferociously in their defense.
===Homelands===
Su-monsters typically inhabited forsaken areas of wilderness or underground lairs. They were particularly known to be found in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] as of [[1361 DR]], and were prevalent on the [[Yadd al-Djinni]] islands of [[Zakhara]]'s [[Crowded Sea]] in the same period.{{AQ-time}}

In the [[Lands of Intrigue]], su-monsters could be found on the island of [[Olodel]].

The su-monsters residing on the island of [[Taramuri]] in [[Kozakura]] possessed such ferocity that they effectively deterred fishermen from establishing a village on the island or venturing into its interior.
===Relationships===
Su-monsters were known to form temporary and chaotic partnerships with [[kech|keches]]. Together the groups of ravenous keches and su-monsters were known to ravage through villages in or close to forests, leaving no survivors. These raids were generally commenced in moonless nights but the partnerships never lasted due to unruly natures of all parties involved.{{Cite dragon/142/The Ecology of the Kech|26-28}}

==Notable Su-monsters==
[[Wongo]], one of the [[Primal_spirit#The_Nine_Trickster_Gods_of_Chult|Nine Trickster Gods]] of [[Chult]], was a su-monster.
