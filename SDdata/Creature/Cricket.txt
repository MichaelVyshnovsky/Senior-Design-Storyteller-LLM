A '''cricket''' was a type of insect. It was used as a [[material component]] in some [[spell]]s such as ''[[sleep]]''.

==Species==
===Cave Cricket===
Cave crickets were a species of cricket known for their very loud chirping, which could drown out all speech and [[verbal]] spellcasting within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} of them.<ref> Particularly large [[albino]] cave crickets, comparable in size to a [[halfling]], could be found in parts of the [[Northdark]].<ref>

===Bog Bush===
Bog bush crickets were a species of cricket found in the [[High Moor]]s.

===Horse===
Horse crickets were known for seeking shade by hopping into the mouths of [[bluetail snake]]s and then being swallowed. [[Lyra Sunrose]] listed them as examples of how [[Cormanthor]] had the world's dumbest insects.
