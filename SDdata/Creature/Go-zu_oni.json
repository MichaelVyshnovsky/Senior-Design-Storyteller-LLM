        "Combat": "Go-zu oni were skilled warriors and trained to use a variety of weapons, such as [[halberd]]s, [[naginata]], [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[trident]]s. They also used their sharp horns to gore an opponent. They were incredibly strong, with the strength of a [[hill giant]].",
        "Abilities": "Go-zu oni had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[fire shuriken]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', and ''[[polymorph self]]'' spells at will, and ''[[cloud trapeze]]'' twice a day. They were able to [[See invisibility|detect invisible]] creatures or objects. Go-zu oni had a natural ability to slowly regenerate from wounds.",
