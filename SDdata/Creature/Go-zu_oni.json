        "mainbody": "Go-zu oni () were the most powerful type of oni.\nThe appearance of a go-zu oni was similar to that of the common oni except a go-zu oni was larger and stockier. Like minotaurs, they were large humanoids with the head of a bull. They commonly wore flowery ornamented robes and well-maintained armor. \nGo-zu oni were skilled warriors and trained to use a variety of weapons, such as halberds, naginata, swords, spears, and tridents. They also used their sharp horns to gore an opponent. They were incredibly strong, with the strength of a hill giant. \nGo-zu oni had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of cause fear, fire shuriken, fly, invisibility, and polymorph self spells at will, and cloud trapeze twice a day. They were able to detect invisible creatures or objects. Go-zu oni had a natural ability to slowly regenerate from wounds.\nGo-zu oni were servants of the Celestial Emperor. They were soldiers in the army of the Celestial Emperor and, since they were the overseers of the lands of the dead, also served as escorts to the recently deceased.\nGo-zu oni lived in the Celestial Court."
