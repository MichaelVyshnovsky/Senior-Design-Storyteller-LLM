        "mainbody": "Fume drakes were elemental spirits created by the lingering magic of a dead dragon.\nThey appeared as greenish clouds of smoke that took the form of tiny, legless dragons.\nIn general, fume drakes were highly territorial, and would attack creatures that got too close to them or their haunts. Otherwise, they were largely indifferent to other creatures, although they were mischievous and enjoyed sowing confusion and inflicting pain.\nFume drakes could not be harmed by heat or poison, and used both to their advantage. They were comprised scalding steam, and they attacked either by exhaling a cone of this super-heated steam or by biting enemies with their fire-hot jaws. If destroyed, a fume drake would explode into a noxious cloud.\nFume drakes did not eat or drink, nor did they require sleep. They could conceal themselves in water or amid smoke, and as such they tended to live in places filled with steam or fumes, such as in volcanic caves or hot springs. They could be found on and below Stormwreck Isle."
