Maridans, also called sea gen or water gen, were gen native to the Elemental Plane of Water.
Sea gen resembled their element with greenish skin and blue hair and eyes. Seaweed and other flotsam was often tangled in their hair. Maridans enjoyed wearing decorations from the sea such as pearls or beautiful shells.
Maridans were wild and playful creatures. A shair ran the risk of hurting their maridans feelings if they did not play along with their pranks and playfulness.
