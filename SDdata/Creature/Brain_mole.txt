Brain moles were a type of mole-like animal that fed on psionic activity, and that would attack victims by psionically burrowing into their brains.
Brain moles were only  long and resembled ordinary moles.
Brain moles were only dangerous in that they needed to eat psionic energy once a week or die they did not attack except to defend themselves. In fact, brain moles were easily tamed and friendly as far as wild animals went.
Brain moles had some minor psionic abilities in the form of mindlink, mindwipe, contact, mind thrust, psychic drain, and psionic sense.
However, if they fed upon psionic energy from a creature that was not naturally psionic, but instead using psionic energy by way of spells or items, there was a chance that the brain moles feeding could cause insanity.
Brain moles lived in tunnel complexes, the only signs of which aboveground were mounded earth. They fed upon psionic energy from other creatures, but not lethally so. Brain moles typically lived in family groups consisting of a mated pair and their children in places frequented by psionic creatures groups of families had been reported dwelling together.
Some people kept brain moles as pets they were especially favored by royalty and nobles who had been harrassed by psionicists. Some sages even claimed that even a dead brain mole would offer some protection against psionic attacks, provided it was worn around the neck as a medallion. Adult brain moles sold for 50 gp, and young for 5 gp, on the open market.
Brain moles were known to serve the duergar deities Laduguer and Deep Duerra.
