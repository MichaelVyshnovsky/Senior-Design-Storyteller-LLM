        "mainbody": "Blade spiders were a type of monstrously sized spider that emerged in the Realms following the Spellplague.\nThese creatures had red fur and blade-like appendages at the end of each of their limbs, including their pedipalps.\nThe blade-like appendages of these creatures were laced with a type of poison.\nAround the late 15 century DR, blade spiders could be found in the pit fights conducted by the Gray Wolf tribe in Vellosk. Around the same time, Doomguide Volahk recovered a map from Jacks laboratory and deciphered the location of a Thayan compound known as the Menagerie within the Neverwinter Wood. There, Red Wizards performed unholy experiments on various creatures, including blade spiders. The hidden enclave was posing active danger to the city of Neverwinter, and eventually, a group of heroes stopped the twisted experimentations.\nBy 1493 DR, they could be found in many parts of Undermountain.\nBlade spiders were typically known to lurk under thick foliage or in crevices, pits, or bolt-holes in floors of caverns.\nThese creatures could be found in the Underdark.\nBlade spiders were a favored pet of drow and some creatures were known to use them as mounts.\nThe driders of the drow city of Tel Verinal, deep beneath the western end of the Moonsea, were known to command small packs of obedient blade spiders."
