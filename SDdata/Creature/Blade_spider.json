        "History": "Around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], blade spiders could be found in the pit fights conducted by the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] in [[Vellosk]]. Around the same time, [[Doomguide]] [[Volahk]] recovered a map from [[Jack]]'s laboratory and deciphered the location of a [[Thayan]] compound known as [[the Menagerie]] within the [[Neverwinter Wood]]. There, [[Red Wizard]]s performed unholy experiments on various creatures, including blade spiders. The hidden enclave was posing active danger to the city of [[Neverwinter]], and eventually, a group of heroes stopped the twisted experimentations.\n\nBy [[1493 DR]], they could be found in many parts of [[Undermountain]].",
