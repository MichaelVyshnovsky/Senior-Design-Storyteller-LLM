Suckertails were a variety of eel found in Tarmalune, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond.
Suckertails had soft sucking mouths, and only ate dung and rotting things. They also ate blood, but not from living beings, only sucking blood from carrion.
People from Tarmalune allowed, and even encouraged, the existence of a large population of wild suckertails in the sewers of Tarmalune, as the suckertails ate all the garbage produced in the city, helping to maintain the city tidy and clean.
Some people even domesticated suckertails to use during their bathing sessions, as short exposure to swarms of suckertails was said to be pleasant.
