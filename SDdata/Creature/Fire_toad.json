Instead of slowly dying out, the fire toads adapted to eating beetles and other insect species in their habitat.\nDue to their hydrophobia, fire toads typically inhabited dry regions with a warm to temperate climate.\nIn Faer√ªn, these creatures could be found in the Fire Marshes of High Moor and underneath the Giantspire Mountains.\nIn the Hordelands they inhabited Semphar, the Raurin desert, and the Quoya Desert. They also inhabited tropical and subtropical deserts in neighboring Kara-Tur.\nBeyond Toril, fire toads could be found in tropical and subtropical deserts on the planet Oerth.\nSome efreeti were known to domesticate fire toads.\nThe blood of a fire toad could be mixed with the blood of a red dragon in a broth to enchant its tooth."
