Once every decade female linnorms would release pheromones that were tuned to the heightened senses of male linnorms, though this call to mate went unanswered more often than not. While mating these creatures entangled their long bodies around one another, forming a sort of "mating ball."

Gray linnorms were the exception to this, remaining with their hatchlings until they could fend for themselves.
These creatures lived inside deep tunnels, which they outfitted with elaborate traps.
