Most were created from the pantheon's [[petitioner]]s, but a few were [[celestial]]s or [[fiend]]s that had been bestowed additional power by a Mulhorandi deity.",
        "Description": "In their base form, the majority of divine minions resembled a greatly well muscled and broad, [[Mulhorandi]] male or female warrior that stood over {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. They dressed in [[bronze]] [[plate mail]], decorated with the holy symbol of their deity. And they were armed with huge Mulhorandi weaponry, such as [[khopesh]]es, [[scimitar]]s, or [[two-handed sword]]s. These weapons were all forged in the [[Outer Planes]] and carried no greater than a ''+2 [[enchantment]]''. Whenever a divine minion died, they and all their possessions would disappear, with the body being reformed in the Outer Planes by their respective power.\n\nMinions of [[Set]] stood out from the rest, wielding [[broadsword]]s or khopeshes<ref name =\"PSCS-MS-pp.14-15\" /> that were fashioned in [[Baator]],<ref name =\"PSCS-MS-pp.14-15\" /> and dressed in black, scaly plate mail.<ref name =\"PSCS-MS-pp.14-15\" />",
        "Personality": "Nearly all divine minions were willing servitors of their respective Mulhorandi power, being fanatical followers willing to sacrifice their very lives to carry out the deity's will. They viewed their service as a great honor.  The minions of Set were the sole exception to this \"willingness\", as that power could unwillingly transform someone into one of his [[lawful evil]] minions. Though once transformed, they too were fanatical in carrying out Set's will.\n\nUnless called by [[divine magic]] to serve a mortal, all but the divine minions of Set preferred not to be noticed by mortals. To this end, they preferred to not utilize their shape-shifting abilities unless absolutely necessary, viewing the revelation as something that would compromise their usefulness to their deity.<ref name =\"PSCS-MS-pp.14-15\" />",
