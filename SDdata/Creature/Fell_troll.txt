'''Fell trolls''', otherwise known as '''giant two-headed trolls''', were one of the largest types of [[troll]]s in the Realms. Some believed that they were a cross-breed between trolls and [[ettin]]s.

==Description==
Fell trolls stood taller than most [[hill giant]]s, standing at {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} tall, and had two heads atop its body that were filled with large, sharp fangs. The hair that protruded from these heads was long, straight, and fleshy. It often writhed of its own accord.

The skin of fell trolls was thick and rubbery, with knotty protrusions, and ranged in tones from mottled moss-green to gray. These knotty protrusions were especially prevalent on their shoulders and back. They moved around with an ungainly, hunched-over posture. They tended to dress in a similar fashion to ettins, wearing the slowly rotting skins of animals.

==Abilities==
Due to them possessing two heads, it was difficult to use mind-affecting spells on a fell troll, such as ''[[charm]]'' and ''[[confusion]]'', or otherwise deceive them by means of [[magic]]. Beyond that, they possessed the regenerative ability that was common to all trolls. However, giant two-headed trolls were earlier reported to not be capable of re-attaching their limbs.

==Combat==
A fell troll viciously attacked its prey up close, latching onto their bodies with its claws and rending the flesh. It would alternatively try to bite at its prey with its massive maws. On very rare occasions, they would fight with some form of weapon.

==Sub-Species==
;'''Glacier troll'''
:A type of two-headed troll that was endemic to the land of [[Ra-Khati]]. Unlike the standard fell troll, these creatures had icy, alabaster skin and were impervious to harm from [[fire]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], giant two-headed trolls were often seen among bands of trolls that were locked in battle in the [[Trollmoors]] with the [[Riders of Nesm√©]] and elsewhere in the [[Savage Frontier]] with [[Waterdhavian]] troops.

==Society==
===Diet===
These creatures were voracious carnivores and would attempt to feast on almost anything, though their preferred meal was [[human]]s. 

===Homelands===
Fell trolls were known to inhabit almost any type of region with a cold climate. They were known to prefer dark environments and thus tended to dwell in damp underground areas, leading groups of smaller trolls.

Fell trolls were primarily found in the [[Unapproachable East]], being an uncommon sight in other areas of the Realms. and occasionally in [[the North]].<ref> In the [[Trollbark Forest]] and [[Troll Hills]], they were often leaders of bands of trolls.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/Troll Mountains and Woods}}

Besides [[Toril]], two-headed trolls were known to be found on the planet [[Oerth]].

===Languages===
Like any type of troll, these creatures were known to speak the [[Giant language]]. 

==Notable Two-Headed Trolls==

* [[Dorig]]
* [[Glarauuth]], a self-proclaimed king who took up residence in the [[Dungeon of Death]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Proffit]], a two-headed troll who acted as a leader over a united force of trolls in the [[Trollmoors]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
