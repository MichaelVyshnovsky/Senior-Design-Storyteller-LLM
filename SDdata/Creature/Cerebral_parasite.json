        "mainbody": "Cerebral parasites were a type of flea-sized creature that fed on psionic activity.\nThese creatures were not visible to most creatures and could only be detected by psionically examining an individuals personal aura.\nCerebral parasites were attracted towards and would attack any creature that got within  of them that possessed some form of psionics.\nWhenever an individual they were infesting used their psionic abilities, whether offensive or defense, a cerebral parasite would drain some of their energy. Once this occurred six times a cerebral parasite would reproduce another of their kind.\nThese creatures could not be attacked by psionic means. Once infested with them, an individual could only be rid of cerebral parasites by means of the spell cure disease.\nCerebral parasites fed solely upon psionic energy.\nThey could be found almost anywhere, even on the Ethereal and Astral planes. They were considered to be commonly encountered creatures within those two planes.\nCerebral parasites sometimes served the duergar deities Deep Duerra and Laduguer."
