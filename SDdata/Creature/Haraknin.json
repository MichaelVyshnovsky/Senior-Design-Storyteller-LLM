        "mainbody": "A '''haraknin''' was a type of [[canomorph]] whose original form was a [[hell hound]].",
        "Description": "Haraknins resembled \"ordinary\" hell hounds in their original form, and typically took on the appearance of a [[human]] or [[half-orc]] with flame-colored hair and red eyes, with wiry, rust-red hair on their body. Haraknins always smelled faintly of brimstone.",
        "Personality": "Haraknins were violent and ill-tempered.",
        "Abilities": "Haraknins, like all canomorphs, could shift between their natural hound forms and humanoid forms at will. Additionally, they had a breath weapon in the form of a {{SIAdj|30|ft|long=yes}} cone of fire that they could use in either form.\n\nHaraknins could use ''[[greater command]]'' at will against hell hounds, and a hell hound would never willingly attack a haraknin.",
        "Combat": "Haraknins were simple and aggressive combatants, favoring charging out of an ambush and simply attacking.",
        "Society": "Haraknins were created by [[archfiend]]s to serve as more intelligent tracking and guard dogs, a role that could also be filled by the two other canomorphs, leading to intense competition between the three types. Haraknins were the most tenacious and common, but were also the physically weakest of the three.\n\nHaraknin preferred to train as rangers or barbarians.",
