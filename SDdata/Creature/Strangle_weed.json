        "Combat": "These plants would detect vibrations in the water and reach out towards their source.\n\nCreatures that were unconscious or calmly floating in the water had a greater chance of escaping the grasp of strangle weeds than those who frantically thrashed about.",
        "History": "An evil [[mage]] in eastern [[Scardale]] once raised a group of [[skeleton]]s to work as farmhands at the gardens of his estate, harvesting crops that partially consisted of bizarre strains of [[mantrap]]s and strangle weeds. Long after the mage passed away, his skeletons continued harvesting these crops well into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",

            "Diet": "Strangle weeds were a carnivorous species of plant.",
            "Habitats": "Strangle weeds were typically found in sea waters with a tropical or subtropical climate.\n\nThey were known to grow in the waters around [[Ravens Bluff]], the temperate and tropical areas of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], as well as in parts of [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and the [[Dalelands]]. In [[Cormanthyr]] they could be found in the eastern edges of the [[Elven Court|Old Elven Court]]. In [[south Faer√ªn]], they grew in the [[Thornwood]].\n\nBeyond [[Faerun]], strangle weeds grew in the jungles and tropical forests of [[Maztica]]. In [[Zakhara]], strangle weeds could be found on the surface level of salt water bodies and in the depths of fresh water bodies.<ref>\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], these plants grew on the planet of [[Oerth]]. Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], strangle weed was quite common in the savannahs of [[Yeenoghu]]'s realm in the [[Abyss]].",
