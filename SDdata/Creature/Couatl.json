        "Description": "A couatl resembled a long, feathered serpent with a pair of rainbow-feathered wings that allowed it to fly. They were around {{SI|12|ft}} in length, with a wingspan of {{SI|15|ft}}. They weighed around {{SI|1800|lb|k}}.",
        "Abilities": "Their powerful minds were capable of great [[psionic]] might.",
        "Society": "Couatls live solitary lives, in pairs, or in flights of 3–6 individuals. Their intellect was above that of most [[human]]s, and often owned treasure. They typically spoke [[Common]], [[Draconic language|Draconic]], and [[Celestial]].\n\nCouatls were known for their beauty, magic, and virtue. Due to their intelligence and devotion to good, they were sometimes worshiped by people who inhabited the same area as they did.",

            "Homelands": "Couatl inhabited warm jungles. They were most common in [[Maztica]]. Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], some couatl could be found in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]."

        "History": "[[File:Couatl tarot.jpg|thumb|''A couatl depicted on Ten tarot card.''|370x370px]]\nThe origins of the couatl lay with [[sarrukh]] clans from the kingdom of [[Okoth]]. Those sarrukh, having realized that their empire was failing, fled to the other [[planes]] of existence. But for over a millennium they were nomadic, traveling from plane to plane as they never found one they were willing to settle in for more than a generation. This life hardened most of them, gradually leading them to embrace their darker natures.\n\nAmong those sarrukh there were a few who despaired of their kindred embracing evil. They chose to break off from their peers and prayed to the deity [[Jazirian]], a fragment of the [[World Serpent]], for aid. He responded by transforming those sarrukh into what became known as the couatl. The rest of the Okothian sarrukh declared war on their transformed former brethren, and despite their superior numbers the couatl held their own. This conflict continued until Jazirian was slain by [[Merrshaulk]], a darker fragment of the World Serpent. This forced the couatl to flee back to [[Abeir-Toril]], where they arrived and settled in the land of [[Maztica]]. Some splintered off, flying east to the land of [[Chult]] to confront the [[yuan-ti]] their people had created.\n\n''circa'' [[-24000 DR]], that splinter group of couatl arrived in Chult and engaged in a centuries long conflict with the yuan-ti for control of the Chultan peninsula, eventually ending with a stalemate that marked the [[Hazur Mountains]] as the boundary line between their territories.\n\nThose that remained in Maztica  were embraced by the deity [[Qotal]] When Qotal later left the [[Maztica|True World]], he made a prophecy that a couatl would one day appear and be greeted by his chosen daughter. This would be the first sign of the god's return to his people.\n\nAround the {{Yearlink|-3000}}, the couatl population of Chult experienced a steep decline and sought out others to help them keep the yuan-ti from spreading their influence into the peninsula's western end. In their search they came to find the [[human]]s and [[tabaxi]] of [[Katashaka]], who they preached to of Ubtao. One couatl, named [[Ecatzin]], came to the Tabaxi tribes. They were initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of wrathful god [[Akongo]], but some gradually came to accept Ecatzin's words and learned a little of his language. And a chosen few were even taught a forbidden [[magic]] called ''matumbe'', which one tabaxi named [[Oyai]], used to slay the [[the Sleeper|the monster]] that had been terrorizing them for millennia. Eventually in [[-2809 DR]], the couatl led those tabaxi tribes, alongside the human tribes [[Eshowe]] and [[Thinguth]], and many others across the seas to Chult in a grand migration.",
