        "mainbody": "'''Yu lung''', also known as '''carp dragons''', were [[lung dragon|dragons]] that were found in the lakes and rivers of [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "The smallest of the [[lung dragon]]s, yu lung only grew up to 35 feet (10 meters) in length. Their body and tail were similar in appearance to those of a [[giant carp]]. They had blue-grey scales with colored markings. Their eyes were yellow and looked like a cat's eyes. Their two arms were tipped with sharp claws. A long beard flowed from under their snout.",
        "Personality": "Yu lung were docile, shy, and withdrawn. They were friendly with other aquatic species, and would even befriend humans.",
        "Abilities": "A yu lung lacked the ability to ''[[polymorph self]]'' and ''[[invisibility]]'', abilities other [[lung dragon]]s possessed. The only innate magical abilities a yu lung possessed were ''[[bless]]'' and ''[[curse]]'', which they could cast three times a day.  Once a day, they had the ability to exhale a cloud of gas, with a diameter of up to 10 feet (3 meters). This gas cloud had the same effect as ''[[potion of healing]]''.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "In [[Faerûn]], yu lung could be found in [[Cormanthor]] in the [[River Ashaba]].<ref>"
        },
        "Celestial Bureaucracy": "The yu lung had no official position in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]. As a result, humans gave it no offerings nor worship. When a yu lung reached adulthood, they meta-morphed into another lung dragon. It was unknown which subspecies of lung dragon they would change into. This process occurred exactly at midnight after reaching the age of one hundred and one. They were then assigned their duties by the Celestial Bureaucracy depending on what subspecies they morphed into."
