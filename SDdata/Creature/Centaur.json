Centaurs of Faerûn did not pay great heed to the gods at all, and those who did usually worshiped [[Silvanus]], not Skerrit, or they chose one of the [[Elf|elven]] nature gods. While centaurs of the Realms were not very religious, the elven deities [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], and [[Solonor Thelandira]] often called on centaurs to serve as agents for their purposes.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}",

        "Regions": {
            "Cormanthor": "In the 1200s [[DR]], a plague affected the numerous centaurs in the [[Cormanthor]] forest, causing their left hind leg to become three inches (7.5 cm) shorter than the others, and, as a result, they could not easily escape from predators such as dragons. The elves and [[halfling]]s of the forest refused to help, fearing that the dragons would turn on them too.\n\nPopulations dwindled so only three tribes of centaurs remained in the forest, each containing around one dozen families, and they were nomadic (within the forest boundary). Their migrations followed the same route each year, spending the winter in the east [[Starwood]]. In the early spring, they moved west, around [[Myth Drannor]], and south to the [[Semberholme]] area, where they spent the summer near [[Lake Sember]]. At the end of the summer they traveled east, stopping for the autumn in the central Starwood, before repeating the cycle.\n\nAlthough the centaurs followed the same trails they had created over the years, these could be difficult for others to follow because they were disguised with a ''[[hallucinatory terrain]]'' spell created by the centaur leaders' magical amulets. These amulets were donated by an unknown friendly human priest.\n\nThe centaurs of the Cormanthor forest were not as friendly toward other creatures as their counterparts elsewhere. They used [[falcon]]s as scouts to warn them of nearby creatures, and were likely to attack on sight with their [[bow]]s. They were still respectful of their surroundings, and would protect the forest and its wildlife. They were known to enjoy [[pear]]s and [[peach]]es in particular.",
            "Evermeet": "Small bands of centaurs lived freely in both the open plains and within the forests of [[Evermeet]]. They would hunt, fish and frolic with complete peace of mind. These centaurs worshiped the [[Sylvan]] deity [[Skerrit]] and were considered by the elves to be \"''children of [[Corellon]]''\".",
            "The High Forest": "By [[1489 DR]], tribes of centaurs made their home in the [[High Forest]], in the plateaus around the [[Unicorn Run]]. At this point, the tribes had grown so much in size and population that their tribes threatened to split and move to claim new territories.",
            "Other areas": "As of [[1368 DR]], centaurs inhabited the [[Chondalwood]]. Some time after [[1485 DR]], centaurs inhabited the [[Far Forest]], where they were protective of their territory."
        },
        "Notable centaurs": "* King [[Gwyon Ironhoof]], ruler of the centaurs on [[Evermeet]].\n* [[Timoth Eyesbright]], a prominent adventurer.\n* [[Wynter]] was a friend of [[Galvin]] and an agent of the Harpers circa [[1362 DR]].\n* The [[Prancer]] led a group of centaurs who inhabited the northwestern edge of the [[Rawlinswood]].\n* [[Kiros]] was chief of the centaurs of [[Bloodstone Pass]] in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Berdak]], a tavern owner in [[Zazesspur]]."
