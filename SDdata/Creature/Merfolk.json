        "mainbody": "'''Merfolk''' ({{SingPl}}; {{Gender|mp|mermen}}; {{Gender|fp|mermaids}}) were aquatic [[humanoid]]s with upper body, arm and head of a [[human]] and legs resembling the tail of a fish.",
        "Description": "A merfolk person had the upper body, arms, and head of a fair-featured [[human]] from the waist up and instead of legs they had a fish-like tail from the hips down. Also distinguishing them from humans were the gills slits along their necks, the slight webbing between their fingers, and their pupils exhibiting an ice blue or pale silver tone.\n\nOn average, mermen grew to be around {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in length and had broader shoulders, while mermaids grew only slightly shorter. On average they weighed around {{SI|400|lbs.|k}} and it was unheard of for merfolk to become overweight, due to their active lifestyles, and possessed greater strength than their physiques would imply.\n\nThe coloration of their eyes, hair, and skin varied as much as those of humans, as did the coloration of their fins and scales &mdash; some colorations being more common in certain areas. Merfolk across [[Faerûn]] exhibited all the varied skin tones of the continent's humans. They tended towards pale pink or tan, though some around the [[Alamber Sea]] and [[Vilhon Reach (sea)|Vilhon Reach]] had darker tones. The most common hair colors were light brown or blond, as these helped them to better blend in to their environment. The rarest of hair colors were blue and silver &mdash; those born with either were considered to have great destinies and so would be raised and watched over by their entire clan.\n\nThe coloration of merfolk fins and scales ranged from a deep kelly green to a brilliant silver, though some colorations outside of this could be found. Some [[Serôs]]ian merfolk exhibited brighter colors and even scales that were striped or speckled. While some merfolk in the Alamber Sea or Vilhon Reach had scales that ranged from copper to golden. During winter seasons, merfolk tails shed their old scales.<ref>\n\nIn terms of clothing, merfolk often adorned themselves with shells and coral.",
        "Personality": "Known to be playful creatures, merfolk would often prank adventurers they came across. Their levels of mischief could come across as cruel, but not overly malicious. \n\n[[File:Mermaid.jpg|thumb|right|''A mermaid warrior riding a [[shark]] and wielding a [[trident]].''|251x251px]]",
        "Combat": "Merfolk were generally known to wield [[crossbow]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[javelin]]s, [[net]]s, and [[trident]]s. They also used [[grappling hook]]s when performing attacks on the surface dweller ships.",
        "History": "The earliest evidence of merfolk in the Inner Sea, some carvings in undersea caves, were dated to around {{YearlinkName|-20000}}.<ref>\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1533}}, the merfolk of [[Thalorlyn]] declared themselves independent and established the First Kingdom of [[Hmur]]. Two years later, [[Aryselmalyr]] quashed the rebellion at Thalorlyn and slaughtered some 30% of all merfolk in [[Serôs]].\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1396}}, the surviving merfolk of the [[Fourth Serôs War]] formed the kingdom of [[Thalvan]] under King [[Darmox]] and the protection of the [[Coronal]] [[Vaeqiis]] of [[Aryselmalyr]].\n\nIn the 6th century [[DR]], the [[Ninth Serôs War]] was fought between the merfolk realm of [[Hmurrath]] and the [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] [[Axe Kingdoms]] of [[Khuur]] and [[Nmalk]] in the undersea land of Serôs. The [[Battle of the Haunted Plains]] took place in [[654 DR]].\n\nIn [[735 DR]], the merfolk kingdom of [[Eadraal]] was founded. Its capital city was [[Voalidru]], just off the [[Hmur Plateau]]. Queen [[Selana]] was crowned the realm's first monarch.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] occurred.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Merfolk were an omnivorous people, both harvesting underwater plant life and hunting aquatic animals to eat. They were also known to herd and raise certain species of fish, much like surface dwellers did with livestock.",
            "Homelands": "Merfolk could be found in a variety of aquatic regions, typically those with a temperate or tropical climate. Many were only seen outside of their watery habitats to visit coastal places or bathe in [[the sun]]'s rays.\n\nSome were known to dwell in the [[Trackless Sea]] and [[Sea of Swords]]. In [[Waterdeep]], merfolk dwelt in the harbor in their own city, and the [[Merdock]] connected the sea to the watermen's guildhall so that merfolk could come through.\n\nMerfolk also dwelt in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], where the name [[Serôs]] was used as a general term for all of the merfolk realms. [[Myth Nantar]] (near the [[Whamite Isles]]) was inhabited by merfolk.{{cite book/Sea of Fallen Stars|173}}\n\nThe falls of [[Rauthgor]] in the [[River Rauthenflow]] were also home to a colony of merfolk.",
            "Languages": "Merfolk generally knew how to speak [[Common]] and [[Aquan]], though some also knew how to speak the language of [[locathah]].",
            "Religions": "Many merfolk worshiped the deity [[Eadro]].\n[[File:Merfolk.jpg|thumb|''A mermaid holding a surface dweller.''|338x338px]]",
            "Relationships": "Merfolk were capable of interacting with surface folk, as they could survive outside of the water as amphibious creatures. However, they rarely traveled more than a few feet away from the water's edge.It was not unheard of for [[Sirine]]s to mate with merfolk, producing children with joint characteristics of their parents, such as webbed fingers and scales.<ref>"
