Those standing within  were liable to be deafened and even knocked over if small enough.\nThese creatures had innate magical abilities, with some being capable of casting clerical spells.\nThese creatures were typically capable of speaking both their own unique language and Common.

They would sometimes send them as messengers to their followers."
