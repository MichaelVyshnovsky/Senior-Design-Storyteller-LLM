        "mainbody": "Zorbos () were small, carnivorous creatures native to Chult.\nZorbos were typically around three feet tall, and covered in gray fur. They had sharp teeth, as well as sharp claws on both hands and feet.\nWithin Shou Lung, a variety of zorbo that resembled pandas was known.\nThey favored human meat, but were also known to enjoy the meat of dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings.\nIn combat, zorbos had the unusual ability to draw on their surroundings to make themselves tougher. For example, a zorbo fighting inside a cave could draw upon the aspects of stone. Additionally, zorbos could absorb the protective features of armor and magical items. If such an item were hit by a zorbo, it would dissolve into dust.\nZorbos were most often found in groups of one to four individuals. and as many as a dozen zorbos could live in a single wukka tree. \n*Obolaka, one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult, was a zorbo."
