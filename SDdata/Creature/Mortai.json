        "mainbody": "'''Mortai''' ({{SingPl}}), also referred to as the '''faces in the clouds'''",
        "Description": "Mortai had the appearance of immense clouds and could perfectly imitate several different types,\n\nWhen they wished to make themselves known, mortai would pulsate with a golden glow and crackle like a thundercloud, followed by the manifestation of various beautiful and wise-looking faces on the surface of their cloud bodies, resembling to various extents [[human]]s, [[demihuman]]s, and [[humanoid]]s. Their voices were booming and thunderous like a storm. Some sages made records of hearing faint laughter and voices within their bodies even when mortai weren't speaking.",
        "Personality": "Mortai were immensely intelligent beings, their intellect rivaling that of [[deities]], with a specialty in matters of philosophy. They were usually pacifistic in nature and enjoyed practical jokes, though they were never malicious or life-threatening. Their favorite pranks to engage in were the creation of small rainclouds that trailed someone for a few days or unleashing a trailing wind to repeatedly blow a hat off someone's head. In most cases of mortals trying to pick fights with them, mortai would simply fly away, though if the mortal was of an [[evil]] [[alignment]] mortai were likely to retaliate in order to teach them a lesson.\n\nThey were more than happy to pretend being ordinary clouds so as to go unnoticed by mortals, preferring not to interfere with them and holding themselves above the affairs of those on the ground. However, mortai were not completely averse to helping mortals by providing info or answering questions, so long as they were approached with respect. Whenever mortai figured that a full revelation would do a mortal less good than having them figure some of it out for themselves, they would hide their advice behind riddles or only provide a portion of an answer.",
        "Abilities": "These beings had perfect control and precise command over any atmosphere that surrounded them, allowing mortai to mimic a number of [[spell]]s. These included ''[[control weather]]'' (three times per day), ''[[control winds]]'', ''[[dust devil]]'', ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[whispering wind]]'', and ''[[wind wall]]''. Mortai also possessed innate magical abilities that resembled the spells ''[[aerial servant]]'', ''[[air walk]]'' (as cast on another), ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[conjure air elemental]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', ''[[rainbow]]'', ''[[rainbow pattern]]'', ''[[wind walk]]'', ''[[death fog]]'', and ''[[cloudkill]]'' (seven times per day). Out of all these abilities, the mortai most frequently called lightning down to strike their foes.\n\nDue to the size and makeup of their bodies it was impossible to harm a mortai physically, unless one were to attack their core. The only effective ways to cause harm to mortai were through [[dragon breath]], magic spells, and similar such effects. However, mortai had a strong innate [[magic resistance]] to anything that tried to alter air or water.\n\nMortai could rain heavily if they so desired and they often chose to do so when being bothered by obnoxious surface dwellers. including the ''[[fly]]'' spell.",
        "Combat": "Being pacifists, mortai generally preferred to flee from combat, even when their opponents were obviously much weaker than them. They only resorted to combat when forced to fight.",
        "History": "When the [[Great Modron March#History|Rogue March]] came through the Beastlands, a mortai by the name of Breath of Life blew the [[modron]]s off course in an attempt to maneuver them away from the [[nymph]] Alisiphone's lake as a favor to her, as she wished to avoid her lake getting polluted like it had during the last [[Great Modron March]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There existed three competing theories as to the nature of mortai's existence. One posited that they were merely collections of [[chaotic good]] [[petitioner]]s that either preferred the form of clouds or were just too chaotic to take the form of an [[animal]] like other petitioners of the Beastlands. Other theories posited that mortai were manifestations of the Beastlands itself or were [[demipower]]s of [[air]] that served the various sky and storm [[deities]] of the [[Upper Planes]], much like how [[Celestial archon|archon]]s served the various deities of [[Mount Celestia]].",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Mortai could be found across all three layers of the Beastlands.",
            "Languages": "All [[languages]] were known by the mortai, though they also communicated with each other by means of rumbling like thunder and shooting lightning.",
            "Relationships": "They occasionally acted as [[favored monster|manifestations]] of the [[Seldarine]] [[deity]] [[Sehanine Moonbow]] and the [[Dark Seldarine]] deity [[Eilistraee]].<ref>\n\nThe [[bird]]-[[spirit]]s of the Beastlands were known to pay them heed.\n\nAt least one mortai was always present with [[Stronmaus]], the [[Giant pantheon|giant god]] of storms and [[storm giant]]s. They were considered by him to be companions and he delighted in soaring through the skies of the Beastlands with them. Additionally, at least one or more mortai were always present around his [[divine realm]] of [[Stormhold]], guiding it through the skies above the [[Karasuthra]] layer of the Beastlands, and some speculated that it could be by their very will that Stronmaus's [[cloud palace]] stayed afloat."
