Cave bears were large, ancient ill-tempered bears that had adapted to life underground.
Typical cave bears had coarse and dark hair.
Cave bears, much like polar bears, used primarily their claws and powerful bite as weapons.
Sometime after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, a family of cave bears resided in one of the caverns of Deadstone Cleft.
Cave bears were typically known to eat subterranean lichen and blind fish.
Cave bears were known to inhabit the Savage Frontier
Cave bears were considered sacred animals to the followers of Clangeddin Silverbeard, Geb, Luthic, and Uthgar.
The priestesses and shamans of Luthic could summon cave bears to their aid and were often protected by several of the beasts.
