        "mainbody": "A blackhair was a breed of horse originating from the village and vale of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast.\nIt was a rugged equine, with short legs and a pony-like build yet reaching the weight and breath of a warhorse, albeit not as tall. Their coats were thick and shaggy with black and dark-brown colors, from whence came their name. A unique adaptation of the breed was a bony plate shielding the sole of the hoof from loose stones.\nBlackhairs were renowned for their strength and endurance, and especially their surefootedness over rocks and mountain slopes. They could carry  with ease, and up to  at a slow pace.\nThese horses were bred and trained in the well-fenced farms west of the road in Maskyrs Eye. Two of the most notable breeders circa 1357 DR were Gundul Hulvesper of Hulvesper Farm and Elephon Stoneshoulder of Northreach Farm. For fear of horse thieves, stable-hands and laborers from beyond the vale were rarely hired at these farms.\nThe blackhair breed was much-sought-after in the Vast, with a single fully trained animal going for up 400 gold pieces in the stock markets of Hlintar or Kurth. However, local Maskyrvians rarely paid more than 75 gold pieces unless they were expected to take it out of the vale to far-off lands for war, trade, or long-distance travel."
