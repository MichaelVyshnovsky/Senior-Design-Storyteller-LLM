        "mainbody": "lailfish were a variety of fish found in the Sea of Moving Ice. They were named after the flail snail, though the reason why was a matter of much debate.\nThese fish sported large, bulbous whiskers that were extremely sensitive. They were poorly understood, but what was known about them was that flailfish used them to detect subtle movements in the water."
