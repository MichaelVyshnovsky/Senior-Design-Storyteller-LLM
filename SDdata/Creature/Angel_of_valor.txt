'''Angels of valor''' were the most numerous, yet weakest, of the [[Astral Sea]] [[Angel (astral)|angel]]s that served [[deities]].

==Personality==
Angels of valor were always quite courageous and fierce.

==Abilities==
These angels were capable of striking their enemies with lightning and when injuried they could temporarily engulf their bladed weaponry in fire.

==Combat==
When in battle, these [[immortal]]s wore [[chain mail]]. They fought with either a [[greatsword]] or a [[dagger]] and a [[longsword]]. Their combat tactics were straightforward, wading right into enemy forces, but did well with collaborating with others of their kind on attacks.

==Society==
These angels acted as the foot soldiers of deities, following the commands of more powerful angels, and some [[cleric]]s.

Some deities would send one of these angels to reward devout worshipers that had done something to please them. This reward could be a [[magic item]] or even the service of the angel itself for a period of ten days.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]],<ref group="note">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki. a group of [[adventurer]]s fleeing from [[Caer Westphal]] were ambushed by a group of angels wielding swords of black flame and wearing black [[tabard]]s, emblazoned with the unholy symbol of [[Cyric]]. They declared themselves envoys of [[Church of Cyric|his church]] and commanded the adventurers to give up one member of their party in return for their lives, saying that Cyric wished it so, or that they would otherwise face death at their hands.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Black Heart|19}}
