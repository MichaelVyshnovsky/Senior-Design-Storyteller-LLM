Dark nagas measured up to approximately  long.. Their scales were dark blue or purple, often with black frills or scale patterns. The body of a dark naga was more similar to that of an eel rather than a snake. Its tail ended in a poisonous stinger.
Their veins contained an oily black or dark brown gore. The naga poison, or venom, was a thick black viscous fluid that dripped from the tail singers venom canal when agitated.
Dark nagas descended from Terpenzi were called nagara.
Dark nagas would attempt to use high terrain to their advantage to stay out of the reach of their enemies.
They could cast sorcerer spells and their stings carried a poison that could induce a nightmarish sleep. They were resistant to all charm effects and had the permanent ability to detect thoughts. Similarly, their own thoughts could not be read.
The Zhentarim were known to use dark nagas as mentors and leaders for bands of orcs. Dark nagas also worked as divine servants of the duergar goddess Deep Duerra.
