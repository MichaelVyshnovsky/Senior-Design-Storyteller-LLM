'''Ravens''' were black birds similar to [[crow]]s.
{{quote|''Ravens are liars. Though most people don’t believe animals to be part of the struggle between [[good]] and [[evil]], no one, including the [[Ravenwitch]], ever asked the ravens. Of course, even if she did ask, she probably wouldn’t get a truthful answer. The Ravenwitch knew her creatures enjoyed falsehood for its own sake and maliciously sought to trick and fool other creatures—and each other—whenever they could. They laughed at the misery and confusion of others and relished the infliction of pain and the letting of blood.''|Excerpt from ''[[The Glass Prison]].''}}

==Behavior==
These creatures were very literal minded and often distracted by shiny objects. They were intelligent enough to be taught how to speak.{{Cite dragon/200/Familiar Faces|32}}

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
[[File:White raven.png|thumb|''Sometimes ravens had white feathers.'']]
Ravens could be found across much of the continent of [[Faerûn]], so much so that it was difficult to find an area devoid of them. Some regions included the [[High Moor]] and the fens and moors of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. Beyond Faerûn, ravens inhabited the continent of [[Kara-tur]]..

Beyond the surface of [[Toril]], large numbers of ravens could be found living in the asteroid known as [[the Castle]], in the center of the [[Tears of Selûne]]. 

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], ravens inhabited the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]'s [[plane]] of [[Qui]], the [[Domains of Dread]], the plane of [[Acheron]], and along the most commonly traveled branches of [[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash.

===Relationships===
These creatures typically harbored animosity towards [[owl]]s.

The [[Raven Queen]] commanded numerous flocks of ravens from her [[divine realm]] in the [[Shadowfell]]. The ravens acted as the Queen's scouts and messengers across the [[multiverse]], also alerting and guiding her [[shadar-kai (elf)|shadar-kai]] servants to the location of items and memories that she wished to collect.

Ravens were also allies to [[wereraven]]s and were usually found together. It was very common for kindnesses of wereravens to hide in plain sight among unkindnesses of ravens.

In the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], a business known as the [[Raven Express]] used trained ravens to deliver mail.{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Raven Express: They Deliver Messages - And More|31}}

==Trivia==
* Some [[Ysgardian dwarves]] could assume the form of a raven.
