Neo-orogs were a race created to serve as warriors for Thay. They were hybrids of orcs and ogres, as well as of other creatures. There were two kinds red neo-orogs and black neo-orogs.
Both types of neo-orog were tall and muscular, with tough, leathery skin. They had large, hooded eyes and bestial snouted faces. Red neo-orogs had mottled dark-red skin and yellow eyes. Black neo-orogs were leaner and slightly taller, with skin that ranged in color from dark green to sooty black, slightly less bestial facial features, and smaller, completely black eyes.
Neo-orogs were violent creatures that lived for battle, yet were also loyal to Thay.
Red neo-orogs had a unique war-cry that heartened them and all other neo-orogs, orcs, and ogres within earshot.
Black neo-orogs were exceptionally stealthy, such that even alert enemies had a very small chance of spotting them while they hid.
Red neo-orogs were known to fight with broad swords, warhammers, axes, maces, spears & shields, crossbows, and daggers. Black neo-orogs were known to fight with broad swords, shortbows, crossbows, longbows, spears, daggers, and shortswords.
For many decades the Thayans tried to breed their own type of orcs that would be violent but loyal in the neo-orogs they had largely succeeded. Bred by magic from orcs, ogres, and other creatures, the biggest drawback was their slow rate of reproduction, such that Thay could only field a few companies. Red neo-orogs were bred as elite troops, while black neo-orogs were bred as archers, scouts, and infiltrators.
No independent neo-orogs existed, with all of them living in barracks built and maintained by the Red Wizards.
