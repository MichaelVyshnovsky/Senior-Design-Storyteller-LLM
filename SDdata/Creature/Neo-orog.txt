'''Neo-orogs''' were a race created to serve as warriors for [[Thay]]. They were hybrids of [[orc]]s and [[ogres]], as well as of other creatures. There were two kinds: [[red neo-orog]]s and [[black neo-orog]]s.

==Description==
Both types of neo-orog were tall and muscular, with tough, leathery skin. They had large, hooded eyes and bestial snouted faces. Red neo-orogs had mottled dark-red skin and yellow eyes. Black neo-orogs were leaner and slightly taller, with skin that ranged in color from dark green to sooty black, slightly less bestial facial features, and smaller, completely black eyes.

==Personality==
Neo-orogs were violent creatures that lived for battle, yet were also loyal to Thay.

==Abilities==
Red neo-orogs had a unique war-cry that heartened them and all other neo-orogs, orcs, and ogres within earshot.

Black neo-orogs were exceptionally stealthy, such that even alert enemies had a very small chance of spotting them while they hid.

==Combat==
Red neo-orogs were known to fight with broad swords, warhammers, axes, maces, spears & shields, crossbows, and daggers. Black neo-orogs were known to fight with broad swords, shortbows, crossbows, longbows, spears, daggers, and shortswords.

==Society==
For many decades the Thayans tried to breed their own type of orcs that would be violent but loyal; in the neo-orogs they had largely succeeded. Bred by magic from orcs, ogres, and other creatures, the biggest drawback was their slow rate of reproduction, such that Thay could only field a few companies. Red neo-orogs were bred as elite troops, while black neo-orogs were bred as archers, scouts, and infiltrators.

No independent neo-orogs existed, with all of them living in barracks built and maintained by the Red Wizards.
