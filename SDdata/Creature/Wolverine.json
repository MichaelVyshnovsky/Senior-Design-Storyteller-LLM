        "mainbody": "Wolverines were a species of mammal related to badgers.\nWolverines were both larger and stronger than badgers. They were skilled at climbing.\nKnown for their ferocity, an injured wolverine would wildly attack its foe until it or its opponent was dead.\nWolverines were largely solitary creatures.\nWolverines were common in the frontiers of the Silver Marches, such as the Moonlands, Adbar Vale, and the Cold Vale.\nIn the Unapproachable East, wolverines were common across the central plains of Rashemen.\nWolverines were a favored animal of the deities Garagos, Malar, Rillifane Rallathil, and Sheela Peryroyl \nThey were sometimes in the companionship of more advanced druids and rangers."
