        "mainbody": "sea wraith was an aquatic form of incorporeal undead that haunted cold waters, guarding sunken treasures and serving Umberlee, the Bitch Queen.\nSea wraiths resembled transparent waterlogged cloaks with barely recognizeable eyes and a gaping maw. They were practically invisible under water.\nThey could not speak, but attack victims who managed to escape a sea wraiths clutches told of hearing intense moaning that overwhelmed their senses.\nA sea wraith could move twice as fast underwater as it could flying through the air. They preferred to attack their victims with stealth, swooping in from unexpected angles beneath the water and grasping with their chilling touch. Sea wraiths enjoyed surrounding a target, effectively blinding them while sapping their strength with intense cold at the same time. The only way to escape such an attack was to move toward sunlight as a sea wraith was completely powerless within natural day light. A victim killed by a sea wraith would become one if its brethren within minutes unless their corpse was removed from the water.\nSea wraiths guarded Umberlees Cache in Waterdeeps Deepwater Harbor."
