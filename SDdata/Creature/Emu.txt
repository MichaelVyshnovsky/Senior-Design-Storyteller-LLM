'''Emus''' ({{Pronounce|E|moo|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) were a common species of flightless bird in the Realms.

==Description==
Emus were almost as tall as another common species of flightless bird, the [[ostrich]], typically growing to heights of {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} and weighing around {{SI|130|lbs|k|long=yes}}.

Unlike their larger cousins, the wings of emus were rudimentary appendages hidden beneath coarse, hair-like feathers. Their plumage was of a dull brown hue that was darker along their head, back, and neck. The plumage of their undersides was of a much lighter hue.

==Behavior==
Like many species of flightless bird, emus were largely non-aggressive and would run away from any potential threat.

==Combat==
When feeling cornered, these birds would peck at the potential threat.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Emus were a herbivorous species.

===Habitats===
Emus were typically found in plains and open grasslands of regions with a warm or subtropical climate.

==Trivia==
* The [[hama]] of wicked souls could take the form of flightless birds, such as an emu.
* An emu could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' [[spell]].<ref>
