They always focused upon a single targeting, confident that they can defend against any other attackers that may come their way.\nThese elementals typically fought alongside their own kind or other creatures that dwelled in the Elemental Chaos, such as shardstorm vortices. In the Prime Material plane, they were sometimes summoned by powerful magic and instructed to guard tombs or treasure-houses."
