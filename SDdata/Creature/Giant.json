        "mainbody": "'''Giants''', known in their own tongue as '''Annamar'''{{Cite dragon+/8/Volo's Guide to Befriending Giants}} or '''Jotunbrud''' ({{Pronounce|joe|tuhn|brood}}), were a number of closely related, long-lived [[humanoid]] creatures of exceptionally large size.",
        "Description": "The appearance of giants varied according to the type of giant (see [[#True giants|true giants]] below) but they were generally [[humanoid]] in appearance, just much larger. Their bone structure was more dense than that of [[human]]s, giving them extra toughness but slowing them down a little.",
        "Abilities": "Most giants had superior senses to humans. In general, they could see and hear twice as well. [[Cloud giant]]s, [[hill giant]]s, and [[stone giant]]s had a particularly good sense of smell. Some had the capacity to see well in low light or total darkness as well. They were immune to almost all [[disease]]s, and had a slight resistance to [[poison]].",
        "Ecology": "A female giant had a pregnancy of between nine and fifteen months, depending on the type of giant.\n\nAlthough their ancestors were immortal, giant life spans decreased with each generation. The life expectancy of a giant in [[1366 DR]] {{Giantcraft date}}, seven or eight giant generations removed from Annam, was believed to be between 300 and 400 years depending on race, although later sources stated that storm and stone giants could live several centuries longer on average.<ref> The oldest giants were well over 1000 years old. Because their lifespans were so much longer than humans, giants were slow to make decisions and would not be rushed.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "{{main|Giant pantheon}}\nGiants often differed in their religious views between species or even between tribes, having been known to argue and even war with one another over the exact desires of a specific deity. Generally, they all accepted Annam All-Father, the creator of giants, as the top of the Ordning, the [[giant pantheon]]. Giants respected the stormazîn as the high priest of Annam, the highest-ranked figure in the giant religious hierarchy, who resided in Annam's grand temple in the [[Ice Spires]].",
            "Ordning": "{{main|Ordning (social structure)}}\nThe ordning was the social order to which all giants adhered. It assigned a rank to each individual giant so that there were none who were equal to one another, only inferior or superior. It was regarded as an act of evil to go against the ordning.",
            "Myths & Legends": "Some giants believed that the stars were [[dragon]] queens preparing to scatter dragon eggs across the land. There was a legend that a dragon god lived in [[the sun]] and led the dragons in war.\n\nSome people, especially those who lived exclusively in the cities, did not believe that giants even existed. Others thought they were magically altered humans. A human myth stated that all giants were evil. This rumor was part of the cause of the formation of the [[Blood Riders]].",
            "Festivals & Events": "The Grand Feast of the All-Father was celebrated on the first day of the new year. On this day, giants would put aside their other responsibilities and have a massive feast celebrating Ostoria's eventual restoration. Ambassadors would be sent from one tribe to another during these feasts to show their unity, and the stormazîn would honor a favored chieftain by dining with that chieftain's tribe.\n\nFor many years after the death of [[Hartkiller]], the chiefs of the largest giant tribes in Faerûn made an annual pilgrimage to the [[Twilight Vale]], where the [[Twilight Spirit]] appeared to them. They asked for its help in fulfilling the prophecy of the return of Annam All-Father. The Twilight Spirit appeared as a very large, shadowy giant whose identity was eventually revealed to be [[Lanaxis]] in [[1366 DR]]. It is unknown whether this practice continued after Lanaxis' attempt to restore the All-Father failed.{{speculation}}"
        },
        "History": "Giants inhabited [[Abeir-Toril]] before any of the other humanoid or demihuman races. The first of their kind and the source of the entire species were the sons of Annam All-Father and his wife [[Othea]], who settled on the planet to form a kingdom known as [[Ostoria]]. Each of their mortal sons was the progenitor of a different type of giant.\n\n[[File:Deadgiant.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''A giant killed during the chaos of the ordning.'']]\nThe giants were soon at war with the dragons. This conflict was to last for over a thousand years. There were differing accounts of its conclusion, although the giants believed it was a result of a stalemate in a game of ''[[wah-ree]]'' between Annam and the dragon god [[Garyx]], while dwarven accounts said that the dragons needed to declare peace to conduct a civil war in which the [[metallic dragon]]s fought the [[chromatic dragon]]s.",

            "Giant-kin": "{{main|Giant-kin}}\nMost of the original giant-kin were half-brothers of the original giants through their mother Othea, but their father was not Annam All-Father.
