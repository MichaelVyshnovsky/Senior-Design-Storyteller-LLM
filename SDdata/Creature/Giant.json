        "mainbody": "iants, known in their own tongue as Annamar or Jotunbrud (), were a number of closely related, long-lived humanoid creatures of exceptionally large size.\nThe appearance of giants varied according to the type of giant (see true giants below) but they were generally humanoid in appearance, just much larger. Their bone structure was more dense than that of humans, giving them extra toughness but slowing them down a little.\nMost giants had superior senses to humans. In general, they could see and hear twice as well. Cloud giants, hill giants, and stone giants had a particularly good sense of smell. Some had the capacity to see well in low light or total darkness as well. They were immune to almost all diseases, and had a slight resistance to poison.\nA female giant had a pregnancy of between nine and fifteen months, depending on the type of giant.\nAlthough their ancestors were immortal, giant life spans decreased with each generation. The life expectancy of a giant in 1366 DR , seven or eight giant generations removed from Annam, was believed to be between 300 and 400 years depending on race, although later sources stated that storm and stone giants could live several centuries longer on average. The oldest giants were well over 1000 years old. Because their lifespans were so much longer than humans, giants were slow to make decisions and would not be rushed.\nthumb|left|A hill giant.\nGiants were intelligent creatures with their own set of cultures and customs. The intelligence varied according to the type of giant (and as with humans, with the individual) but most were at least on a human level of intellect, Most giants saw themselves as superior to all other creatures. The ordning was one reason for this, but they were also much larger than many other species, so they would talk down to and patronize smaller folk, regarding them as unimportant.\nthumb|220x220px|A building damaged by giants.\nAncestry was important to giants. Most giants could trace their lineage back to Annam All-Father, and it was recited formally when introducing oneself to other giants. Once a relationship had been established between giants, whether it was amiable or hostile, this would be continued further down the lineage. Therefore, reciting ones lineage helped to dictate the relationship that would be established. Frost giant skalds (bards) would include lineage in the sagas they wrote.\nGiants had a different sense of good and evil than most other creatures. A \"good\" (maat) act for a giant was an act that honored a giants deity or family, displayed bravery, or honored another \"good\" giant, regardless of the consequences. An \"evil\" (maug) act was one of cowardice stealing betraying a giants deity, family or trust or an act that forced a giant from its natural terrain type. Violating the ordning was also considered evil (see Ordning below).\nGiants often differed in their religious views between species or even between tribes, having been known to argue and even war with one another over the exact desires of a specific deity. Generally, they all accepted Annam All-Father, the creator of giants, as the top of the Ordning, the giant pantheon. Giants respected the stormazîn as the high priest of Annam, the highest-ranked figure in the giant religious hierarchy, who resided in Annams grand temple in the Ice Spires.\nThe ordning was the social order to which all giants adhered. It assigned a rank to each individual giant so that there were none who were equal to one another, only inferior or superior. It was regarded as an act of evil to go against the ordning.\nthumb|220x220px|Giants causing chaos over their feud.\nAlthough the ordning dictated the leader of a tribe and the leaders will had to be obeyed ordinarily, it was possible for the priests or shamans of two conflicting tribes to conduct a parley in which their consensus was binding for the leaders of both tribes. The intention of the parley was for both parties to agree upon the will of Annam All-Father in the situation at hand, but often the party with more power simply asserted his own will. This system had been further abused in the past, where tribal priests or shamans engineered conflicts to fulfill desires that they would not normally be able to.\nSome giants believed that the stars were dragon queens preparing to scatter dragon eggs across the land. There was a legend that a dragon god lived in the sun and led the dragons in war.\nSome people, especially those who lived exclusively in the cities, did not believe that giants even existed. Others thought they were magically altered humans. A human myth stated that all giants were evil. This rumor was part of the cause of the formation of the Blood Riders.\nThe Grand Feast of the All-Father was celebrated on the first day of the new year. On this day, giants would put aside their other responsibilities and have a massive feast celebrating Ostorias eventual restoration. Ambassadors would be sent from one tribe to another during these feasts to show their unity, and the stormazîn would honor a favored chieftain by dining with that chieftains tribe.\nFor many years after the death of Hartkiller, the chiefs of the largest giant tribes in Faerûn made an annual pilgrimage to the Twilight Vale, where the Twilight Spirit appeared to them. They asked for its help in fulfilling the prophecy of the return of Annam All-Father. The Twilight Spirit appeared as a very large, shadowy giant whose identity was eventually revealed to be Lanaxis in 1366 DR. It is unknown whether this practice continued after Lanaxis attempt to restore the All-Father failed.\nGiants inhabited Abeir-Toril before any of the other humanoid or demihuman races. The first of their kind and the source of the entire species were the sons of Annam All-Father and his wife Othea, who settled on the planet to form a kingdom known as Ostoria. Each of their mortal sons was the progenitor of a different type of giant.\nthumb|220x220px|A giant killed during the chaos of the ordning.\nThe giants were soon at war with the dragons. This conflict was to last for over a thousand years. There were differing accounts of its conclusion, although the giants believed it was a result of a stalemate in a game of wah-ree between Annam and the dragon god Garyx, while dwarven accounts said that the dragons needed to declare peace to conduct a civil war in which the metallic dragons fought the chromatic dragons.\nA true giant was one who could trace its lineage back to Annam All-Father and Othea.

They were considered last in the ordning by true giants.\n* Firbolg Intelligent and reclusive giant-kin with a deep connection to nature, they rejected the ordning for their own code of conduct focusing on community.\n* Fomorian Hideous and malformed giant-kin.
