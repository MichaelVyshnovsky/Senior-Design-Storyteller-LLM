        "mainbody": "A cow was a type of herd animal\nCows could charge their opponents in battle, as well as gore them with their horns.\nMany recipes throughout the Realms required products specifically from cows, such as pepper cheese and later varieties of Elturian Grey, which used cheese, and breek, which used beef. Such products were exported across Faerûn, as well as cows themselves, i.e., from Chessenta and Saradush.\nInhabitants across Faerûn were known for naming buildings such as taverns after the creatures, such as the Happy Cow in Daggerford, and the Blue Cow in Saerloon.\nA cow usually sold for about ten gold pieces, and they were often used as trade goods.\n* Sharrada, long-horned, cold-resistant cattle kept for meat\nThe deity Hathor appeared to have the head of a cow."
