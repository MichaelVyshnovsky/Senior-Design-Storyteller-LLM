'''Deceiver genies''' were tasked [[djinn]] whose lives revolved around deception and illusion. Oddly enough, deceiver genies were more susceptible to believing illusions than most creatures.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Monstrous Compendium Pages}}

==Description==
The true form of a deceiver genie was difficult to ascertain because of the constant web of illusions surrounding them. Powerful [[sha'ir]]s were needed to penetrate their true appearance.

In their natural form, deceiver genies were tall and gaunt. They had one blue eye and one brown. Their skin was a mottled grey color.

==Combat==
These genies were cowards who were constantly surrounded by an illusionary effect similar to that of a [[displacer beast]].

All deceiver genies could use the following spell-like abilities at will: ''[[change self]]'', ''[[delude]]'', ''[[false vision]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', ''[[undetectable lie]]'', ''[[whispering wind]]''.

They could use the following abilities twice per day: ''[[distance distortion]]'', ''[[massmorph]]'', ''[[spectral force]]'', ''[[shadow magic]]''.

The following powers could be used once per day: ''[[disbelief]]'', ''[[projected image]]'', ''[[solipsism]]'', ''[[sundazzle]]'', and once per week they could use the following: ''[[mass suggestion]]'', ''[[permanent illusion]]'', ''[[programmed illusion]]'', ''[[veil]]''.

All illusions created by a deceiver genie could only be dispelled or defeated by extremely powerful archmages or their equivalent.

If forced into physical combat they could attack with their great strength and steel nails with raking attacks at their opponent’s eyes.

==Habitat/Society==
Deceiver genies would occasionally build, and hide, small communities within the desert. They were capable of lying even under any form of magical coercion.

If given idle time, a deceiver genie would concoct ways of making life miserable for their master. They viewed the entire world as a blank canvass on which they could paint their lies and deceptions.

Though they did not care about wealth, deceiver genies were fascinated by all forms of art. Because of this they would never harm artists, including [[bard]]s.

Their utterly unpredictable nature and high intelligence made them at least as dangerous as [[slayer genie]]s.

==Ecology==
These genies served the [[noble djinn]] or, in rare instances, a powerful [[jann]]i. Binding a deceiver genie to servitude was a dangerous affair as the genie usually appealed to their master’s servants to betray them.
