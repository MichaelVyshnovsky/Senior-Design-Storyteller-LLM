A tyrannosaurus rex, sometimes improperly called a fang titan drake, or as gnasher by the people of the Malatran Plateau, was a carnivorous species of dinosaur.
Tyrannosauruses were enormous predators, with large heads that measured  long with teeth that were  in length. Despite their enormous size, they were known to be fast runners.
Tyrannosaurs were not greatly intelligent and their savage nature could occasionally lead them to doing self-destructive acts, such as swallowing the horned head of a triceratops whole.
Among those who knew of dinosaurs, tyrannosaurs were considered to be some of the most fearsome and dreadful of carnivorous dinosaurs.
Tyrannosaurs were a carnivorous species that hunted any creature they considered edible, and were terrors to all other creatures in their territory. If prey was scarce, a tyrannosaurus could survive on carrion and smaller creatures.
Tyrannosaurs were primarily known to inhabit the jungles of Chult and the Malatran Plateau.
Beyond the Prime Material plane, some could be found in the Forbidden Plateau, the divine realm of Thard Harr.
The fangs of these creatures were highly valued by collectors outside of Chult.
