Podokesaurus () was a species of dinosaur.
Podokesaurs were small and looked like their cousins compsognathus.
Podokesaurs were agile predators, striking first and fast. They hunted in packs and a pack of pdokesaurs were able to bring down larger prey.
Podokesaurs were most often encountered in forests and plains. 
Podokesaurs were carnivores and lived, and hunted, in packs. If food was scarce, it was not uncommon for podokesaurs to resort to cannibalism, eating weaker members of their pack.
