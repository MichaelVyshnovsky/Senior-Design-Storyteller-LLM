'''Podokesaurus''' ({{Pronounce|po|dak|e|SAR|us|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was a species of [[dinosaur]].
==Description==
Podokesaurs were small and looked like their cousins [[compsognathus]].
==Combat==
Podokesaurs were agile predators, striking first and fast. They hunted in packs and a pack of pdokesaurs were able to bring down larger prey.
==Habitat==
Podokesaurs were most often encountered in forests and plains. 
==Biology==
Podokesaurs were carnivores and lived, and hunted, in packs. If food was scarce, it was not uncommon for podokesaurs to resort to cannibalism, eating weaker members of their pack.
