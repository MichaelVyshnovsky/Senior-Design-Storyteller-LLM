The term referred to any yuan-ti with a roughly equal blend of human and serpentine features. Despite their disparate appearances, malisons shared several common abilities.",

            "Abilities": "[[File:Yuan-ti Malison AFR.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''A yuan-ti malison whose form resembled that of a cobra.'']]\nLike all true yuan-ti, halfbloods had psionic powers. All yuan-ti could morph their bodies into the form of any viper and sense the presence of any poison nearby by force of will alone. Moreover, they were innately resistant to magic. In addition to these common powers, halfbloods could psionically [[Animal trance|entrance animals]] and [[Cause fear|instil fear]] or [[Suggestion|suggest]] actions to those of weak willpower. They could also control small plants, vines, and weeds by thought (much like the ''[[entangle]]'' spell); call forth magical [[darkness]]; and [[Neutralize poison|neutralize any poison]].\n\nThey could change the color of their skin and scales to match their environments, much like a [[chameleon]]. Their bodies oozed an acidic secretion, and their bite was venomous.\n\nHalfbloods from [[House Sseradess]] could breathe underwater.\n\nSnake-headed halfbloods from [[House Se'Sehen]] could spit venom.\n\nThose halfbloods with tails could use them to constrict opponents, to climb, and to swim. had prehensile tails. Those with snake torsos in place of legs from [[House Sauringar]] were known to be able to puff up their bodies to look larger and more threatening.\n\nHalfbloods with snake-like arms could bite with the fangs at the end of each appendage.",
            "Life Cycle": "Like all yuan-ti, malisons hatched from eggs and grew to adulthood by twelve years. They could live as long as 120 years, but the average lifespan was 80 years."

        "Personality": {
            "Combat": "Yuan-ti in general favored high-quality weapons. Halfbloods favored [[scimitar]]s and [[composite longbow]]s and often wore [[studded leather]] armor. It was not uncommon for them to poison their blades and arrows.\n\nIn combat, they let the weaker purebloods fight first, while they stayed in hiding and used range weapons or their psionic abilities to confound their foes. Only if the purebloods failed would they join into melee combat."

            "Language": "Halfbloods spoke the [[Yuan-ti language]], [[Common]], and any local languages. They often learned [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]] or [[Draconic language|Draconic]] as well.",
