'''Pigs''', also called '''hogs''' and '''swine''', were a kind of [[animal]] raised as livestock, generally for the sole purpose of being eaten. Farmers who raised pigs were often called [[swineherds]].{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|14}} They were known as '''slaugh''' among some [[elves]], [[dryads]], and other forest-dwellers (which literally translated to "mud-wallowing [[dog]]s").{{Cite polyhedron/74/The Everwinking Eye: Words To The Wise|15}}

Male pigs used for breeding were called "boars" while the females were called "sows".{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|15}} A newborn was called a "piglet" until it was weaned, at which point it was a "shoat". Most male shoats were then castrated, ensuring that they grew to be fat and docile.

==Description==
Pigs were usually {{SIrange|2|3|feet|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder.

===Uses===
Domestic pigs were important as sources of [[pork]], and especially as sources of cured meat that was durable and could travel, including [[salt]]ed or smoked cuts such as [[bacon]] or [[ham]]. Whole roasted adult or suckling pigs were major centerpieces of many cultures' feasts and festivals as well as big draws at inns and taverns. Pigs' ears were a delicacy in some parts of [[Faer没n]].

Pigs' organs, including intestines and brains, were also used for food or cooked into gravy. Their bladders could be used as [[sausage]] casings or to make [[sugar bladder]]s (a sort of confection).

Pig fat, sometimes known as [[lard]],{{Cite dungeon/87/The Raiders of Galath's Roost|37}} was used in cooking{{Cite digital book/Spellfire||11}} and to make pastry dough.

Some pig parts also had non-culinary uses. Their bladders could be inflated or filled with water to create children's diversions known simply as [[bladder]]s. [[Pigskin]] could be tanned to make [[pouch]]es and to use as upholstery.{{Cite dragon/413/Spin a Yarn: Jantharl's Surprising Journey|20}}

In [[magic]], certain profane rituals and [[curse]]s, such as those performed by the [[anchorites of Talos]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], involved the use of pigs' hearts or blood. Fatty pieces of pig could be used as [[material component]]s in spells like ''[[grease]]'' or ''[[grease slick]]''.

==Behavior==
Domestic pigs were gentle and docile creatures, although they were known to be both more stubborn and more intelligent than other forms of livestock.

Pigs were easy to keep alongside other domestic animals, like [[chicken]]s or [[goat]]s. While usually harmless, pigs could become irritable when underfed and swineherds risked nasty bites and kicks, especially from breeding males which might also have tusks. As a result, it was not uncommon for swineherds to wear [[leather armor]] and leather gloves, or something similar.{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|16}}

They were not fans of the cold of winter nor of the heat of summer, the latter of which just made them seek to wallow and sleep in the mud.

==Combat==
Most pigs&mdash;domestic or wild&mdash;did not attack [[humanoid]]s unless they felt threatened, were compelled by [[Enchantment|magic]],

==Society==
Domestic pigs were raised as food and were almost never used for labor, unlike other livestock such as [[cow]]s.{{Cite polyhedron/59/The Living City: The Two Brothers' Butchery|7-8}} Live pigs were also a valuable trade commodity, or ship. An average pig sold for 3 [[gold pieces]].

===Faer没n===
[[File:Oinkerboinker.png|thumb|350px|''An ettin swineherd tends to his hogs.'']]Pigs were a staple in [[north Faer没n]] since the days of ancient [[Netheril]], and were kept everywhere from the [[Sword Coast North]] and [[Dessarin Valley]] in the west to the [[Bloodstone Lands]] in the east. They were raised all over the [[Moonsea]] region, including [[Thar]], and notably in [[Zhentil Keep]], the [[Winterspear Vale]] near [[Hulburg]], and the countryside near [[Phlan]],<ref name = "DDEX1-7-p9">{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|9}} [[Hillsfar]],<ref name = "DDEX3-5-p13">{{Cite adventurers league/Bane of the Tradeways|13}} [[Elventree]],<ref name = "DDEX3-8-p7">{{Cite adventurers league/The Malady of Elventree|7}} and [[Mulmaster]] (where it was common practice for the city to give cadavers to pig farmers to be used as pigfeed).{{Cite polyhedron/68/The Everwinking Eye: Goodbye, Mulmaster|27}} Pigs were also common in [[the Vast]], where herds were allowed to range and graze on [[mushrooms]], [[acorn]]s, and roots as well as small [[snake]]s and [[bird]]s at [[Hog's Hill]] north of [[Raven's Bluff]],{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|13}} and around the town of [[Hlintar]], which was renown for its muddy pig farms and the high-quality bacon which they produced. In the [[North]], [[hill giant]]s were sometimes known to raise their own pigs, such as at [[Grudd Haug]].

Pigs could be found throughout the [[Moonshae Isles]], including on [[Alaron]], [[Norland]], and the larger islands of the [[Korinn Archipelago]], where they were a major export. Whole roast pigs were served at [[Northlander]] feasts.

In the [[Eastern Heartlands]], pigs were raised in [[Cormyr]] and across the [[Dalelands]]. Most notably, they could be found in [[Battledale]] near [[Hap]], (although the entire dale was known for its pigs), in [[Scardale]] (notable for its pig farmers allowing their herds to forage freely in the woods, and for using the smell of roasted [[corn]] to lure them back home), and in [[Mistledale]] (where some pigs at [[Sharin Freehold]] were bred to have wings strong enough to let them fly short distances to avoid predators).

In the [[Western Heartlands]], pigs were raised across [[Elturgard]] from the [[Fields of the Dead]] to [[Berdusk]]. They were also found in the [[Sunset Vale]], notably around [[Corm Orp]], where they freely ranged the hills east of town. It was not uncommon in these parts for the raising of pigs to be overseen in part by local temples dedicated to agricultural [[deities]], such as the [[Great Mother's House]] of [[Chauntea]] or the [[Ladyhouse]] of [[Sheela Peryroyl]].

Further south, pigs were kept in [[Tethyr]],{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|17}}{{Cite dungeon/54/The Fiends of Tethyr}} [[Amn]] (notably in the grasslands of [[Riatavin]]), and in [[Manshaka]] in [[Calimshan]]. An Amnian delicacy was [[pig's head]]. Pigs were also raised in the [[Border Kingdoms]], notably in the [[Blacksaddle|Barony of Blacksaddle]]{{Cite polyhedron/132/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms|13}} and the [[Realm of the Ready Sword]].

In the east, herd of pigs were kept in [[Mulhorand]], especially in the [[Great Vale]], and in [[Thay]], where the [[Red Wizards]] often used them to feed their pet monsters and guardians. Pigs were rare in [[Chessenta]], resulting in pork being a much sought-after import. Peasant families kept pigs in the [[Hordelands]], notably in [[Ra-Khati]] and [[Khazari]].

Comparing someone to a pig was an insult in Faer没n, and was generally meant to imply greediness, gluttony,

===Kara-Tur===
Pigs were commonly eaten throughout most of [[Kara-Tur]], and whole roast pigs were served as the centerpieces of festivals in places like [[Akari]]. Pigs were also raised in the [[Plain of Horses]], notably in [[Jugicha]] where the [[Tsu-tsu]] tribe were known to be uniquely proficient in pig breeding. Among the [[Nubari]] of [[Malatra]], the [[Simbara]] tribes often raised pigs, although calling one of their warriors a "pig herder" was seen as an insult.{{Cite polyhedron/102/The Malatran Plateau|11}} The [[korobokuru]] were known to keep pigs.

In Kara-Turan magical tradition, the pig was the animal correlate of the element of [[water]].

Comparing someone to a pig in Kara-Tur was an insult meant to imply a lack of honor.

===Zakhara===
Pork was eaten in [[Zakhara]] and, as in other continents, likening someone to a pig was derogatory. Pigs were also the subject of a Zakharan maxim: "A butchered pig has no need to fear the oven."

A prominent feature of the Zakharan desert were steep, rocky ridges known as [[hogback]]s, so named because of their resemblance to wild pigs.

===Other Planes===
Beyond [[Toril]] and the [[Prime Material plane]], pigs were raised in [[Sigil]] where they were bought, sold, and bartered for in the [[Sigil/Market Ward|Market Ward]], including a two-headed variety. They were also raised in the [[plane]] of [[Arcadia]].

==Ecology==
===Domestic Pigs===
Domesticated pigs lived either with individual families&mdash;usually with each containing a trough and a manger&mdash;and a muddy place for the pigs to wallow (which could double as a conveniently disgusting place for a farmer to hide their valuables). Pig farms in general were famous for how horrible they smelled.

Pigs were fed everything from mushrooms, [[plants]] and [[grains]] to [[egg]]s, [[fish]], and small animals to [[insect]] larvae, [[worm]]s, and garbage,{{Cite polyhedron/65/The Living City: Holly's Mill|6}} or even human remains. That said, it was common wisdom that pigs produced better meat when allowed to forage rather than being fed grain or trash. Swineherds wielding [[swineherd's crook|special crooks]] and calling "sooooeeee!" would often oversee a foraging herd as it ranged out from their farm, but in some cases pigs were allowed to forage unsupervised before being summoned back for slaughter.

Domestic pigs were popular prey for everything from [[wolves]] to roving [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s, who were prone to steal them from farms. They were also a favored host of [[tatterdemanimal]]s, and their pigsties were often home to [[rat]]s.

Whole pigs were fed to domestic [[catoblepas]] to keep them docile, and were used as bait for hunting young [[ankheg]]s, which would gorge themselves to death on a suitably large pig carcass.

===Wild Pigs===
While the term "wild pig" could occasionally be used to describe [[boar]]s or [[warthog]]s, it was also used to describe a class of smaller wild swine and escaped domestic pigs. but also including things like insects and [[stirge]] eggs. They were hunted not only by humans but by [[lizardfolk]] and [[wemic]]s.

Wild pigs were common in the Eastern Heartlands. They could be found in Cormyr,{{Cite dungeon/62/Grimjaws}} including in the mountains of the [[Storm Horns]] and [[Thunder Peaks]], as well as in the [[Stonelands]], the [[Goblin Marches]]{{Cite dungeon/87/The Raiders of Galath's Roost}} and in the surrounding [[Cormanthor]] forest. They could also be found in [[Sembia]].

In Kara-Tur, wild pigs were known to inhabit [[Mad Monkey Island]] near [[T'u Lung]].

In Zakhara, wild pigs were a popular food of [[serpent lord]]s.

==History==
A colony of [[dwarves]] once spent 50 years trying and failing to raise pigs in the [[Glaun Bog]] in Cormyr.

In [[Ches]] of {{Yearlink|1357}}, a ship called the ''[[Bloody Umber]]'' heading for Scardale disappeared on the [[Inner Sea]] with a cargo of live pigs.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, an expedition of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] to [[Chult]] brought along live pigs for food, however their herd soon died out.

==Notable Pigs==
* [[Lewy Jons' hog]] was the prized pig of farmer [[Lewy Jons]] of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s DR.
