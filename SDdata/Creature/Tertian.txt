'''Tertians''' were the second-most powerful type of hierarch [[modron]]s.

==Description==
Tertians were very tall humanoids, with a height of {{SI|12|ft}}. They had a prehensile tail that acted as a third arm, at the tip of which was a growth that was similar to a [[mace]]. A tertian had a ring of horns that encircled their hairless head.{{Cite dungeon/144/Diplomacy|68â€“85}}

==Combat==
If forced into combat, a tertian will use a combination of innate abilities, spells, tail and fists.

==Abilities==
Like all hierarch modrons, tertians had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Tertians were able to cast [[arcane]] spells as well as [[divine]] spells from the [[Law domain|Law]], [[Protection domain|Protection]] and [[War domain|War]] domains. Tertians were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.

==Society==
They acted as judges, judging and sentencing both [[modron|modrons]] and non-natives. Nine tertians existed, with eight of them reporting to the [[secundus|Secundi]], and the final one reporting to [[Primus]] himself.

==Ecology==
Tertians were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within {{SI|405|mi|k}} and could see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}.
