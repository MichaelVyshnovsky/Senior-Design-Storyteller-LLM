A swamplight lynx was a magical cat found in swampy or marshy terrain.
Swamplight lynxes were between nine and ten feet long with large paws and short tails. Their coloring (usually a shade of yellow) allowed them to camouflage themselves in their surroundings.
Swamplight lynxes particularly liked the taste of elven flesh.
Swamplight lynxes had several magical abilities, including light and faerie fire, which they used to confuse and distract their targets.
Swamplight lynxes dwelt in swamps and marshes.
