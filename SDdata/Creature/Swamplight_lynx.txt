A '''swamplight lynx''' was a magical cat found in swampy or marshy terrain.

==Description==
Swamplight lynxes were between nine and ten feet long with large paws and short tails. Their coloring (usually a shade of yellow) allowed them to camouflage themselves in their surroundings.

Swamplight lynxes particularly liked the taste of [[elf|elven]] flesh.

==Combat==
Swamplight lynxes had several magical abilities, including ''[[light]]'' and ''[[faerie fire]]'', which they used to confuse and distract their targets.

==Habitat==
Swamplight lynxes dwelt in swamps and marshes.
