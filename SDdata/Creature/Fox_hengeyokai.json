        "mainbody": "Fox hengeyokai () or simply foxes were a fox-based subrace of the hengeyokai, a race of intelligent natural shapechanging animals able to adopt fox, human, and hybrid forms. They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.\nIn human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form.\nCompared to humans and the average hengeyokai, foxes were slightly smarter but lacked wisdom, or they were more agile. They could be fairly fleet-of-foot too. Some had a natural knack for escape artistry or stealth.\nOn the whole, foxes were usually evil.\nKnown to be evil, fox hengeyokai were typically avoided by suspicious humans.\nFoxes, along with several other types, were more likely than other hengeyokai to become fighters and rangers as well as assassins and sorcerers. Foxes were also among those that had the strongest talent for magic as wu jen.\nIn Shou Lung, the Sheng Ti province was home to a large number of foxes and other hengeyokai by the midâ€“14 century DR, with many clans found there. They were so populous and accepted here that they could roam freely in the cities, even in hybrid forms and even the normally distrusted foxes, unlike anywhere else in the empire. In fact, some whispered the Sheng humans gained their small and elegant stature from contact with the hengeyokai and spirit folk. By the late 15 century DR, Kara-Turan hengeyokai saw Sheng Ti as a sanctuary and many migrated there.\nIn Kozakura, hengeyokai dwelled in isolated enclaves across the islands. Among the most populous were the fox hengeyokai of northern Shinkoku.\n* Maatsuki, wu jen and member of the Iridescent Peacock Society\n* The Serpent, yakuza ninja and leader of the Phoenix clan"
