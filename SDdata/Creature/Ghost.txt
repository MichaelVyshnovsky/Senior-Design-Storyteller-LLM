Ghosts were the souls of a deceased sentient creature that had been bound to haunt a specific area, object, or creature that held significance to them when they were alive.
It was not exactly known for certain what caused some people to become ghosts, but over time a number of recurrent factors had been observed. Often this state of existence was because of a soul having been horrendously evil in life, their deaths being tremendously emotional, being denied a proper burial, or because they had unfinished business.
These spirits typically resembled how they had in life. However, some ghosts had an altered appearance due to the nature of their demise. Others were known to be capable of changing their appearance to suit their current disposition. Often this altered appearance was due to the alignment they had in life, revealing the true awfulness of their soul. Sometimes ghosts were observed to be adorned in chains and weights, which some believed to be a warning from the gods to not follow a wicked path.
A ghosts behavior was typically similar to the personality they had in life. But in some cases, their personalities were altered by the process of death.
The "unfinished business" that drove ghosts varied widely. Some might seek to fulfill an oath, others to relay a message to a loved one, while some might simply desire to have their death avenged. They also tended to get enraged whenever items their bodies were buried with were stolen and would stop at nothing to get them back.
Evil-aligned ghosts were said to hate goodness and all forms of life, being driven by a sense of wickedness and spite. As well as a desire to end the lives of other creatures, in particular those responsible for or connected to its death. For such ghosts it was nearly impossible to negotiate with them.
Sometimes ghosts were unaware that they had died and thus would continually act out the daily routine they had in life. Sometimes ghosts only had fragmented memories of their life.
Being a form of undead, ghosts had no need for the air, food, drink, or sleep that they formerly required in life.
*Ethereal All ghosts possessed an ability known as materialization. This allowed them to phase between the Ethereal Plane and the Prime Material plane, They could also see  into one plane whilst standing in the other. Even when manifested on the Prime Material, a ghost was still partially within the Ethereal plane and could be interacted with normally by ethereal creatures.
*Incorporeal (Spells) Ghosts were resistant to all spells based around acid, fire, lightning, and thunder. They were also immune to spells based around cold, necrotic energy, or poison. Prior to the Spellplague, it was impossible to harm them with spells of any kind unless one was in an ethereal state.
*Incorporeal (Weapons) When it came to weapons, ghosts could only be harmed by those that were enchanted, They could also be harmed by holy water while in their semi-material form. Many also had some form of weakness tied to their former life &mdash the ghost of a tortured person could be harmed by the implements that had been used to torture them.
*Putting to Rest However, some ghosts were so strongly tied to the Prime Material that they would always reform a few days following being destroyed by any of the aforementioned means. Thus, the only surefire way to permanently rid an area of a ghost was by resolving the spirits unfinished business. 
Prior to the Spellplague, humans and demihumans killed by a ghost typically remained dead permanently, due to having had all their life-essence drained out of them.
Occasionally ghosts in the Realms were capable of causing all magical items within  of them to glow with a cold, white radiance.
* Horrifying Visage These undead spirits exuded a supernatural sense of fear in all non-undead creatures within  of them. This sense of fear caused creatures to flee and sometimes the fear would be so great that their bodies would age by ten to forty years. As this fear was supernaturally provoked, even the most courageous of creatures could be affected. This aging effect could be reversed with greater restoration, but only if done within twenty-four hours.
* Possession Ghosts were capable of possessing the body of any humanoid that they could see within  of them. Doing so made the creature incapacitated and fully under the control of the spirit. It was observed by some that while possessing a body ghosts were able to speak through them, though the voice would not be of the victim nor would the jaws or tongue noticeably move. Rather, the voice would be of the one the ghost had while alive and it would emanate from deep within the victim. Besides killing the possessed, a ghost could be expelled from their body by means of the spells turn undead or dispel evil and good. Once free, it was impossible for a creature to be possessed by a ghost for the following twenty-four hours.
* Magic Jar Prior to the Spellplague, ghosts were more well known to use an ability similar to the spell magic jar on victims within  of them rather than possession.
* Moan of Fear Prior to the Spellplague, many ghosts were capable of emitting a moan that provoked a fear effect in living creatures.
* Telekinesis Prior to the Spellplague, some ghosts were known to be capable of a form of telekinesis.
* Touch Their most direct offensive ability was a sort of withering touch that imparted necrotic energy onto a target.
Anything they possessed when they manifested was ethereal, possessing the ghost touch property. These were often things they were buried with. If someone were to take the original material item that a ghosts copy was based on, then the ethereal copy would fade away.

Ghosts were known to occur in any type of region, Sailors who died out at sea alongside their vessel could potentially manifest upon an incorporeal reflection of it.
Places haunted by ghosts tended to emanate sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled desires. Haunted locations often had certain areas where there were strange noises, sounds they had enjoyed in life, an unnatural silence, an unnatural feeling of cold, or inanimate objects moving around. Though such manifestations would be due to a ghosts presence, the spirit did not consciously manifest them and had no control over them. Noise manifestations were often projected through walls or door and were observed by some to cease as soon as a living creature got close.
In Cormanthyr, the ghosts of many elves and dwarves haunted the ruins of the Old Elven Court.
Unusually for a non-abandoned city, ghosts were a somewhat common sight in Velen. 
Besides the Prime Material plane, ghosts were often known to be found in the Shadowfell, including the Domains of Dread, such as Barovia.
Like many types of undead, ghosts knew all languages that they had known in life.
Some ghosts were willing to work with or for other creatures if they believed that doing so could help them achieve their desires. They were often seen in the company of flameskulls, larva mages, rot harbingers, and spectres.
Besides mere creatures, some ghosts acted as servants of deities, such as Kiaransalee. The ghosts of diligent priests of Moradin were said to haunt certain trails, old abandoned delves, and mountain passes &mdash in these places they would appear before lost dwarves or the allies of dwarves, especially during harsh weather, and guide them along a safe route to either their destination or some form of refuge.
