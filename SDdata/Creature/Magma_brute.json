Around that time, some were serving Vanifer and her Cult of the Eternal Flame.\nMagma brutes lived a largely solitary existence.\nLike all magma beasts, brutes were capable of speaking the Primordial language.\nBrutes could be bribed with regular offerings of food. They occasionally bullied claws and striders into fighting alongside them. Brutes themselves were often easily persuaded or intimated into serving more powerful elementals, including fire archons, fire giants, salamanders, or even an eye of flame.\nLike all magma beasts, a brute could subsist on merely clay, ores, and even minor elementals. Though they preferred to hunt and feast upon organic creatures, savoring the taste of burned flesh. Whenever they killed a humanoid they would devour them whole, including their equipment.\nThese creatures were native to the Elemental Chaos."
