        "Personality": "Magma brutes were one of the more intelligent species of magma beast and were ill-tempered.",
        "Abilities": "Like all magma beasts, brutes were immune to the effects of petrification, had some resistance to [[fire]], and were particularly vulnerable to cold-based [[spell]]s and abilities.",
        "Combat": "[[File:MagmaBrute Versus Tiefling.png|thumb|273px|''A magma brute rears back to bash a [[tiefling]].'']]\nAs befitting their name, magma brutes fought by bashing enemies with their fiery fists.",
        "History": "Following the [[Spellplague]], many magma brutes made their way through [[elemental vortex|elemental vortices]] and planar rifts into volcanic regions of [[Toril]]'s and the [[Underdark]]. magma brutes could be found inhabiting [[Mount Hotenow]]. Around that time, some were serving [[Vanifer]] and her [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]].",

            "Relationships": "Brutes could be bribed with regular offerings of food. They occasionally bullied claws and striders into fighting alongside them. Brutes themselves were often easily persuaded or intimated into serving more powerful elementals, including [[fire archon]]s, [[fire giant]]s, [[salamander]]s, or even an [[eye of flame]]."

            "Diet": "Like all magma beasts, a brute could subsist on merely clay, ores, and even minor elementals. Though they preferred to hunt and feast upon organic creatures, savoring the taste of burned flesh. Whenever they killed a [[humanoid]] they would devour them whole, including their equipment.",
            "Habitat": "These creatures were native to the [[Elemental Chaos]]."
