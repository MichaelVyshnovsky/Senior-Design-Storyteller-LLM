A '''gaze spider''' was a [[giant spider]] that attacked with a paralyzing gaze.

==Description==
Gaze spiders had low intelligence and were of [[chaotic evil]] alignment.

==Combat==
When in combat, these giant spiders would try to make their enemies meet their gaze. If they were successful, their enemies would have a chance to become paralyzed. However, it was possible to reflect their gaze back at them, causing them to suffer the effects themselves.

==Ecology==
Such arachnids were commonly found in [[Kalistes' dimension]].
