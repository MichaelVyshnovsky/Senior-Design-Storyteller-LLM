A gaze spider was a giant spider that attacked with a paralyzing gaze.
Gaze spiders had low intelligence and were of chaotic evil alignment.
When in combat, these giant spiders would try to make their enemies meet their gaze. If they were successful, their enemies would have a chance to become paralyzed. However, it was possible to reflect their gaze back at them, causing them to suffer the effects themselves.
Such arachnids were commonly found in Kalistes dimension.
