'''Quell''' were ghostly [[undead]] creatures that despised the mere concept of life and hated the connection the living had to the [[deities]]. In essence, they hated the act of worship and the very presence of a quell isolated a worshiper from the touch of their god.

==Abilities==
A quell could lash out at [[divine spellcaster]]s of any faith, an act known as ''intercession'', preventing them from accessing [[the Power]]. Several of them would work together and ''intercede'' against even notable powerful clerics. 

==Notable appearances==
Because of their unique abilities, quell were often used by [[necromancer]]s to protect themselves from divine powers.

A quell was sent by [[Pandorym]] against [[Thormud Horn]] in {{yearlink|1374}}.{{cite book/Darkvision|75-79|8}} Quell were among the armies of the undead commanded by the [[nighthaunt]] [[Ysval]], when they assaulted the nation of [[Thay]] in the year [[1375 DR]].<ref name="U-p?>
