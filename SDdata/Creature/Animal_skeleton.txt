'''Animal skeleton''' was a general term for [[skeleton]]s created from the corpses of small to large-sized vertebrate animals.

==Abilities==
Much like other skeletons, these creatures were immune to ''charm'', ''hold'', ''sleep'' effects and [[death magic]]. They were vulnerable to [[holy water]] and turned by [[cleric]]s like any standard skeleton.

==Variations==
;[[Revived fossil]]: A skeleton created from the remains of an animal that had been preserved in a [[petrified]] state.{{cite book/Libris Mortis|118-119}}
;Warhorse skeleton: An animal skeleton created from the corpse of a [[warhorse]].

==Notable Animal Skeletons==
* [[Toysmiths]], a toy store in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], kept a skeletal [[war dog]] as a guard animal. Rather than having its bones exposed, the store's owners kept the animal skeleton stuffed inside of a plush dog.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/50/The Living City: The Toysmiths|11}}

==Ecology==
Animal skeletons were typically created by means of the ''[[animate dead]]'' [[spell]] to serve as minor guardians, Additionally, around one to twelve animal skeletons could be conjured by ''[[undead summoning I]]''.

Members of the [[Church of Malar]] annually animated the skeletons of great [[deer|stag]]s and other beasts on the night of [[Eleasis 9]] for a festival known as the [[Bone Dance (festival)|Bone Dance]].

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], a number of whale skeletons roamed near [[Thordentor]], defending an undersea lair belonging to the [[Twisted Rune]].<ref>
