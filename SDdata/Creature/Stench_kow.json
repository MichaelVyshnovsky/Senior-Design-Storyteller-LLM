        "mainbody": "The stench kow, () also spelled as stench cow, was a species of bison native to the Lower planes.\nThe bodies of these creatures bore a resemblance to the standard bison, but were misshapen. They had humps over their shoulders, with bulls having the largest, and long horns that curved downwards. Their heads were huge and had pugged features, large round eyes, and lolling tongues. Their fur was largely a dull orange, with a matted greenish mane.\nThese creatures were very hardy compared to the average bison. They were able to withstand severe cold, heat, and poison, and poisonous clouds of both a mundane and magical nature.\nThe name of these creatures was derived from their breath and bodies having terribly foul odors so horrible that being close to them could cause one to be poisoned, in a similar manner to the spell stinking cloud.\nThese creatures had a basic animal level of intelligence.\nStench kine fought other creatures by charging at them and trying to trample them.\nMuch like their Prime Material cousins, stench kine traveled in grazing herds.\nStench kine fed upon much of the noxious and poisonous growths throughout the Lower planes, such as bloodthorn and stinkweed.\nStench kine were only found in the Lower planes, being most common in the Nine Hells. They could also be found in Acheron, Gehenna, and Hades.\nMany archdevils were known to possess some form of stench kow herd.\nThe horn of a stench kow could be used as an alternative ingredient for crafting a potion of fire resistance.\nThe Infernal Rapture restaurant in Avernus often served cheese made from the milk of stench kine."
