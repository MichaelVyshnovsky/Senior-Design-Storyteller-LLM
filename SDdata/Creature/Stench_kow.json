        "mainbody": "The '''stench kow''', ({{Plural|stench kine}}) also spelled as '''stench cow''', was a species of [[bison]] native to the [[Lower planes]].",
        "Description": "The bodies of these creatures bore a resemblance to the standard bison, but were misshapen. They had humps over their shoulders, with bulls having the largest, and long horns that curved downwards. Their heads were huge and had pugged features, large round eyes, and lolling tongues. Their fur was largely a dull orange, with a matted greenish mane.",
        "Abilities": "These creatures were very hardy compared to the average bison. They were able to withstand severe cold, heat, and [[poison]], and poisonous clouds of both a mundane and [[magic]]al nature.\n\nThe name of these creatures was derived from their breath and bodies having terribly foul odors so horrible that being close to them could cause one to be poisoned, in a similar manner to the [[spell]] ''[[stinking cloud]]''.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures had a basic animal level of intelligence.",
        "Combat": "Stench kine fought other creatures by charging at them and trying to trample them.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Stench kine fed upon much of the noxious and poisonous growths throughout the Lower planes, such as [[bloodthorn]] and [[stinkweed]].",
            "Habitats": "Stench kine were only found in the Lower planes, being most common in the [[Nine Hells]]. They could also be found in [[Acheron]], [[Gehenna]], and [[Hades]].",
            "Relationships": "Many [[archdevil]]s were known to possess some form of stench kow herd.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|32}}",
            "Usage": "The horn of a stench kow could be used as an alternative ingredient for crafting a ''[[potion of fire resistance]]''.{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|40}}\n\nThe [[Infernal Rapture]] restaurant in [[Avernus]] often served [[cheese]] made from the [[milk]] of stench kine."
