'''Dolgrims''' were a kind of [[aberration]] native to [[Eberron]]. They were created, reportedly through combining pairs of [[goblin]]s, by the [[w:c:eberron:Daelkyr|daelkyr]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, during a celebration of [[Dragondown]], a group of dolgrims made an incursion into [[Toril]]. They participated in the chaos that the village of [[Skeefan]] got caught up in due to the [[bronze dragon]] [[Chotyn]]'s retaliation against what she believed to be the thieves of her egg. During this event, dolgrims could be found in Skeefan, the forest surrounding the village, the [[Tarlain]] family estate, part of the [[Trackless Sea]] coastline, and Chotyn's cavern lair.
