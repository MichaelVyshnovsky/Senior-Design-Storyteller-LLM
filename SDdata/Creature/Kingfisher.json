Their feathers were largely deep blue or bluish gray in color, with white crests.\nKingfishers had a basic, animal level of intellect and were a relatively harmless species.\nThese creatures were capable of lifting creatures, but nothing  above, into the air.\nKingfishers typically laid around two to eight eggs per year.\nLike many species of bird, kingfishers attacked by means of their beaks and sharp talons.\nThese birds primarily lived in flocks.\nKingfishers were a carnivorous species of bird. They preyed upon fish and small mammals, such as rabbits. They would spear the former with their beaks.\nKingfishers could be found in the forests, plains, or mountains of regions with a tropical, subtropical, or temperate climate. Their habitats ranged over large areas due to their migratory nature.\nOn Faerûn they could be found in Marsh of Tun in Cormyr. Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in the tropical forests of Kara-Tur.\nBeyond the planet of Toril, kingfishers could be found on Krynn. And beyond the Prime Material, kingfishers could be found alongside many other predatory birds as part of the hunting parties of Remnis.\nKingfishers were a favored animal of the deity Aerdrie Faenya.\n* Many cultures considered kingfishers to be omens of death or war.\n* The family crest of Tu Lungs Tan clan was a kingfisher.\n* The spell flight of Remnis could summon a kingfisher to the aid of its caster."
