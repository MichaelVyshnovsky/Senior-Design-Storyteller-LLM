        "mainbody": "Jackals were common desert canines. Some desert tribes considered the jackal a natural example of wisdom and cunning.\nThe jackal looked something like a mixture of a wild fox and a domestic dog. Like other dogs their size, they were skilled at jumping and tracking by scent.\nJackals, like other small dogs, hunted in packs, of about one to six animals, but usually, they scavenged for their food. They were not very brave animals and were not typically aggressive.\nJackals were known to inhabit the Calim Desert during the time of the city of Cursrah., the Lonely Moor, the land of Amn. and the Raurin desert.\n* 1077 DR was known as the \"Year of the Friendly Jackal.\""
