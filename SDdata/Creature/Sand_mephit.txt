A '''sand mephit''' was a kind of [[mephit]] tied to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]].

==Description==
Sand mephits had small, winged humanoid forms, colored in earthy browns. They shed a small amount of sand as they moved.

==Personality==
These mephits were generally mischievous and mean-spirited, seeking to cause trouble whatever the situation.

==Combat==
Sand mephits fought by clawing at their enemies, and could unleash a breath of searing heat to burn everything in front of them. Although they weren't very strong, they were immune to fire and life-destroying effects.

==Ecology==
Sand mephits were short-lived creatures linked to the Elemental Plane of Earth, and were closer related to [[salt mephit|salt]] and [[dust mephit]]s than other kinds. They preferred dry, arid environments, and could be found in the [[Stonelands]] of [[Faer√ªn]], as well as in the desert of [[Har'Akir]] in the [[Domains of Dread]]. They could also be sent by the powers of the [[Lower planes]] as agents against their enemies.
