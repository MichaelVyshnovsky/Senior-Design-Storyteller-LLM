Flounder was the name given to several species of flatfish,
A species of flounder known as witch was found inhabiting the Sea of Moving Ice. There, it was believed that these fish were bled for some dark rituals by hag covens, however those old fishwife tales had little truth to them.
Flounder was a common type of fish to be fried for consumption. The cheap Waterdhavian dish called melverfew was made using diced eels, mushrooms, catfish, and founder, slowly cooked until tender in oxen-and-onion gravy.
The Golden Goblet Inn in the town of Mossbridges served baked flounder dish for the price of a single gold coin, and Ravens Bluffs restaurant called Embrol Sludges Eatery & Shell Shoppe sold dishes made with fresh flounder paired with fine elven wine.
