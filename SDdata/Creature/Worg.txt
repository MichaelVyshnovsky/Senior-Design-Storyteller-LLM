A '''worg''' was a type of [[magical beast]] that resembled a normal [[wolf]] but was larger, more intelligent, and had a fiendish countenance.

==Description==
A worg resembled a typical wolf, though much larger and bearing an intelligent, wicked gleam in its eyes. They had gray or black fur, and on average stood {{SIAdj|3|ft|adj=high}} high and were {{SIAdj|5|ft|adj=long}}. They weighed around {{SI|300|lb|k}}.

One known grouping of worgs, presumably in the [[Western Heartlands]],{{Speculation}} was the ''Nordiland worgata'' family. They were known for having particularly glossy coats.

==Behavior==
Despite their higher intelligence and evil traits, worgs tended to act, for the most part, like regular wolves. They often hunted in packs, but were sometimes solitary creatures. Lone worgs tended to hunt smaller animals, while mated pairs and packs hunted larger game. They preferred large, herbivorous animals, usually the young, sick, or weak, but weren't afraid to take [[humanoid]]s, especially when other food sources were exhausted.

==Combat==
In any number, worgs employed similar tactics. They would stalk humanoid prey for a number of hours or even days, choosing the best of time of day and terrain for the attack. When they did, they employed hit-and-run tactics to exhaust a victim, until finally the whole pack went in for the kill. If they outnumbered a victim or were especially impatient, they might try to corner the prey, then attack.

They attacked with their teeth. Like a wolf, they could bite their prey and try to bear them down to the ground. They also had the benefit of stealth, keen senses, and the ability to scent prey.

Their horrific growl was known to instill terror in their prey.

==Society==
Unlike most animalistic creatures, worgs could speak. They could speak both [[Common]] and [[Goblinoid]], as well as a language of their own.

Worgs of [[Faerûn]] venerated [[Malar]] under the named of "The Great One." After worg's death, the Great One led its soul into the unending Great Hunt – worgs' afterlife. In the Great Hunt worgs were given the blessing of the bloodlust as they gored and mutilated their former masters and hunted other prey.

| text   = 
- Worgs are SMART. Probably smarter than you. Never forget it.<br/> - They'll hunt in packs but only if they like each other. Best mix is some quite typed and other aggros. Keep each other calm-like.<br/> - Never let them taste meat you don't want them to go for all the time. People, never ever.<br/> - Don't play favourites. They're very sensitive.

Worgs were sometimes enslaved by [[orcs]], [[goblins]], and other such creatures to act as mounts or attack [[dog]]s. And sometimes they were specifically being bred for these purposes. They were also used as mounts by some bands of [[hobgoblin]]s.

Worgs were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of the deity [[Garagos]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}

===Usages===
Worg fangs were valuable alchemical commodity. When calcinated they were reduced to ashes of worg fangs, which, in turn, was mixed with certain types of [[salt]]s to make ''[[elixirs of bloodlust]]''.
