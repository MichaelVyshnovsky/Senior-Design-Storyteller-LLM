A '''phoenix''', or '''''phoenix nobilus conflagrata''''' (sacred, or fiery phoenix), was a powerful [[elemental]] bird that embodied the wild and unpredictable nature of [[fire]].

==Description==
Phoenixes were enormous birds with brightly colored feathers ranging from orange to red and violet, and blue-violet beaks and claws. Their talons had the consistency of [[diamond]]s. Their eyes were a glowing [[ruby]] color. A phoenix's body was naturally bright and shed its own light.

Phoenix bodies were almost immaterial, composed of flame taken solid shape. For that reason, they were capable of passing through extremely narrow passages and of engulfing opponents within their fiery bodies.

==Personality==
Phoenixes were described by many sages as champions of [[good]], and by others as random agents of destruction. Most accounts agreed that phoenixes were reclusive creatures that did not seek out contact or conflict with other creatures, but, if disturbed, provoked, or properly motivated, showed relentless fury and destructive power.

Phoenixes had a fierce hatred toward [[undead]] and attacked them on sight.

==Abilities==
The eyes of these creatures were capable of seeing in [[Darkvision|total darkness]]<ref group="note" name="ultravision">Their ''[[Monster Manual II 1st edition|Monster Manual II]]'' entry simply stated that their ultravision was double the normal range. The ranges shown were approximated from multiplying the base ranges outlined in ''[[Players Handbook 1st edition]]''. They were practically impossible to sneak up on or surprise.

Their bodies were capable of withstanding incredibly severe cold and heat.

===Innate Abilities===
Phoenixes possessed an incredibly wide array of magical abilities. They were capable of near instantaneously detecting the presence of [[detect charm|charms]], [[detect evil|evil]], and [[detect magic|magic]]. Their bodies radiated an effect similar to ''[[protection from evil]]'' in a radius of out to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. They could make themselves ethereal, allowing them to travel either ethereally or astrally.

The touch of their wings gave off an effect similar to ''[[cure light wounds]]'' and a touch of their comb gave off one similar to ''[[cure disease]]''. Whenever their blood was spilled, a phoenix could make its droplets act as ''[[fire seeds]]''. By spreading their wings and uttering a call they could ''[[dispel illusion]]'' or ''[[dispel magic]]''. By performing a dance they unleashed an incredibly powerful ''[[exorcise|exorcism]]''.

In severe situations a phoenix could create a ''[[fire storm]]'' and ''[[incendiary cloud]]'', which would destroy them in the process and leave a gem-like egg that would hatch into a new phoenix within twenty days.

Phoenixes possessed no offensive [[psionic]] abilities and could not be harmed by them, though they typically had a handful of disciplinary powers. They could use ''[[cell adjustment]]'' once per day, ''[[energy control]]'' and ''[[molecular agitation]]'' three times per day, as well as ''[[probability travel]]'' once per week.

===Spellcasting===
In addition to all of the previously mentioned abilities, phoenixes were capable of casting a wide array of spells that included ''[[affect normal fires]]'', ''[[audible glamer]]'', ''[[blink]]'', ''[[blindness]]'' ''[[blur]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[Control temperature, 10' radius]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[find traps]]'', ''[[fire charm]]'', ''[[fire shield]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', ''[[produce fire]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', ''[[remove fear]]'' within a {{SIAdj|10|ft}} radius, and ''[[snake charm]]'' at will. They were also capable of casting ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[heat metal]]'', and ''[[polymorph self]]'' up to three times per day, as well as ''[[call woodland beings]]'', ''[[duo-dimension]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', ''[[fire quench]]'', ''[[fire seeds]]'', ''[[fire storm]]'', ''[[incendiary cloud]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', ''[[reincarnate]]'', ''[[veil]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]'' once a day.

==Combat==
In combat, phoenixes were fierce adversaries with no fear of a fight to the death, especially since their rebirth was assured. Though their physical attacks were quite fast and powerful, they often preferred to use their large array of innate magical effects.

Phoenixes were extremely effective at destroying buildings and structures.

If a phoenix was slain in combat, its body exploded in a violent detonation that destroyed the phoenix and most of its surroundings.

==Society==
===Homelands===
Phoenixes could be found in the deepest reaches of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and in remote locations in [[Elysium]]. 

As reclusive creatures, they tended to avoid contact with others.

===Languages===
In addition to being capable of speaking with all species of bird, phoenixes communicated with other creatures through [[empathy]] and [[telepathy]].

==Ecology==

}}
All phoenixes were male. They had extremely long lifespans, estimated to be between 1,000 and 12,000 years, and their reproduction process consisted entirely of self-immolation and rebirth. The ashes left behind by a slain phoenix included an extremely hot cinder egg that weighed {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}}. The egg was completely immune to all forms of damage. After a few days, it hatched into a new phoenix.

===Uses===
Phoenixes were among the most sought-after creatures by [[sage]]s and [[alchemist]]s. Virtually all parts of their bodies could be used as ingredients for [[potion]]s or in magical research. A phoenix's feathers could be employed in the creation of a ''[[staff of healing]]'' and in powerful ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]''. Other body parts, such as eyes, beaks, and talons, could also fetch high prices, but many cultures considered slaying a phoenix to be a bad omen.

The ''[[fire wings]]'' [[spell]] required an amulet in the shape of a phoenix as its [[material component]].

A phoenix's feather, when used as an additional component of a ''[[raise dead]]'' spell, granted additional powers to its magic. In addition to extending the time window since the creature's death during which the spell was effective, it was capable of extending the life of a creature that had died of old age by one year.

A potion called the ''[[phoenix extract]]'' was rumored to have been conceited using phoenix blood. When imbibed, it granted the boon of ''[[elemental shield]]'' against flames.

===Relations===
A rare intelligent species of [[firebird]]s found in the [[Blade Kingdoms]] were distantly related to phoenixes and shared a [[phoenix language|language]]. They were known for loud screeching that could crack mortar and kleptomaniac love for [[gem]]s and [[jewelry]].

== Notable Phoenixes==
The spire of [[Howler's Crag]] located in [[Cocytus]], the second layer of [[Pandemonium]], was built atop the grave of a phoenix [[deity]] who held the secret to reincarnation. Its opponents killed the phoenix out of envy and cast its body in Pandemonium. The latent divine magic of the phoenix granted the place its magical properties.

A phoenix was also said to inhabit the vast desert of [[Mithardir]], the third layer of [[Arborea]]. Its nest was said to become a pillar of fire at night.
