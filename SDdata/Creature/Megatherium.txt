Megatheriums, also known as ground sloths or giant ground sloths, were ancient massive land-based mammals related to Tree Sloths.
Megatheriums were giant sloths, and like their much smaller cousins, they were covered in long, coarse fur. They were capable of walking on their hind legs, but generally preferred to travel on all fours.
Megatheriums were known to be peaceful animals,  but became aggressive during their mating season.
Despite their slow movements, megatheriums were incredibly powerful. The paws on their forearms sported  claws. They used these claws to gather food but they also made for effective defensive weapons. Their thick hide protected them from harm.
Once a year, a female megatherium could birth a litter of up to two cubs. A juvenile megatherium reached maturity in four years.
Megatheriums were a herbivorous species, but were also known to eat meat to supplement their diets when needed.
In interior Faer√ªn, megatherium could be found in the Shining Plains.
