        "mainbody": "Needletooth dinosaurs, sometimes called needlefang drakes, were carnivorous dinosaurs who lived and hunted in large groups, known as needletooth swarms.\nNeedletooth dinosaurs were vibrantly colored and the size of an average cat&mdashonly about  tall and weighing an average of &mdashbut they had proportionally very large and sharp fangs, from which they earned their name.\nNeedletooth dinosaurs were almost always encountered in a swarm, which traveled along the ground like a brightly colored wave. They emitted high-pitched whistling, chirping, and trilling noises, which, combined with their generally inquisitive and brave attitude, could give the impression that they were harmless or even adorable. However, in truth they were deadly and fearless predators who swarmed and devoured their prey like terrestrial piranhas. Even worse, they were known to be both crafty and patient when hunting their prey.\nA swarm would harass prey until it was time to strike, at which point it surrounded the victim and closed in from all directions. They would swarm all over their target, tearing at the flesh with their teeth and attempting to drag the prey to the ground to eat it alive. The prey quickly started bleeding profusely, and would become overwhelmed with distractions as the swarming continued. Humanoid prey struggled to do anything but try to get rid of the biting creatures. If they managed to pull their victim to the ground, a swarm could strip it to the bone in a matter of seconds.\nSome subspecies of needletooth dinosaurs were also venomous, and caused their preys reflexes to atrophy as they swarmed.\nNeedletooth dinosaurs were aggressive predators of land animals, although they were neither picky about what they ate nor scared of attacking creatures that were new or strange to them. When hungry, they were utterly fearless and would charge directly at a potential meal, and unfortunately, they were known for always being hungry. They were also territorial, but were known to chase prey for miles.\nMultiple swarms of needletooth dinosaurs could be encountered together, with large groups of up to eight distinct swarms known as prides.\nThey were native to the warm forests and jungles of Chult and the Black Jungles, where they were naturally adept at camouflaging within the dense underbrush and foliage.\nIt was not unheard of for swarms to be kept as living traps or&mdashin some cases&mdashas exotic pets."
