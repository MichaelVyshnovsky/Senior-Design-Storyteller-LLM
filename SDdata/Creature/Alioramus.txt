Alioramus were dangerous and meticulous hunters. They had powerful jaws that could crush a set of inch-thick plate mail. They had colorful hides and feathers and clawed three-toed limbs.
Alioramus attacked with their sharp, raking claws and powerful jaws, causing open wounds and bleeding. In combat, they pounced on their victims, pushing them to the ground into a vulnerable position. The largest of the species, alioramus colossa, could provoke a mating frenzy by exuding mating pheromones, driving its pack into a berserker-like rage, strengthening the packs attacks and making them temporarily resistant to harm and unaffected by charm or fear.
