'''Half-fiends''' were the hybrid offspring of a [[fiend]] and another creature.

==Types of Half-fiends==
Some of the more numerous, powerful, or otherwise prominent varieties of half-fiends include:
* [[Cambion]]: A general term used to refer to the result of the breeding of a fiend (normally a [[devil]]) and a human woman. They had the general appearance of humans, but with the addition of differing fiendish traits.
* [[Alu-fiend]]: A specific term used for the offspring of a [[succubus]] [[demon]] and a mortal male. Alu-fiends tended to be very attractive in appearance, but with small, bat-like wings and sharp teeth.
* [[Draegloth]]: A very specific variety of half-fiends, draegloths were the offspring of [[drow]] females and [[glabrezu]] demons. Draegloths were tall (7â€“8 ft), with the obsidian skin and white hair of drow but a somewhat hound-like head, four arms like a glabrezu (the larger, upper pair ended in huge claws), and a mane of hair covering their backs and shoulders.
* [[Durzagon]]: Durzagon were the result of the union between a [[duergar]] and a devil. They were often revered by other duergar as great leaders.

==Notable Half-fiends==
* [[Isair and Madae]]: Leaders of the [[Legion of the Chimera]].
