        "Description": "Faerie dragons were extremely small in comparison to their large [[metallic dragon|metallic]] or [[chromatic dragon]] cousins&mdash;about the size of a [[cat]]. Each had an iridescent coat of scales that reflected all colors of the rainbow, predominantly reflecting one particular color which changed with age. They had a long, prehensile tail and platinum-colored, butterfly-like wings.\n\nLike true dragons, faerie dragons grew stronger with age, but they matured much more quickly and lived shorter lives. Because their predominant scale hue ran the colors of the rainbow over their lifetime, their color was a direct indicator of their age and power. The scales of a young hatchling were almost always red, and those of a fully mature dragon (over 50 years old) were violet.",
        "Personality": "Like many dragons, they tended to be pranksters, but faerie dragons were especially mischievous. They were often referred to as the pranksters of the wild.",

        "Society": {
            "Lair": "Faerie dragons often built their lairs high off the ground in the boughs, crotches, and hollows of trees, making them out of any materials they could gather from the forest floor, such as dry grass, leaves, [[spider silk]], twigs, small branches, tree bark, and mud.",
            "Diet": "Their diet consisted mostly of small bugs caught in the air, from trees and bushes, and off the ground. They also fed on fruits, berries, nectar, and butterflies, which they ate to get the color and look of their wings.",
