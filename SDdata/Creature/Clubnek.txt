'''Clubneks''' were an uncommon, mutated sub-species of [[ostrich]].

==Description==
Unlike the standard ostrich, these creatures had hard, bony yellow beaks and their feathers came in various shades of green. They occasionally bursted into high-speed sprints.

==Behavior==
Clubneks were typically non-aggressive unless threatened, though their behavior was very erratic and hard to predict.

==Combat==
Clubneks attacked by using their hard beaks and large talons.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Clubneks were primarily known to be a herbivorous species.
===Habitats===
Though they could on occasion be found underground, clubneks primarily resided within forests and meadowlands.

In [[Faer√ªn]] they could be found in the medium woods of [[Daggerdale]], [[Cormanthor]], and [[Shadowdale]]. Particularly in the [[Border Forest]] and [[Vale of Lost Voices]].
