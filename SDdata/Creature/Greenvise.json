        "mainbody": "Greenvises, also known as greenvise vines, were a semi-intelligent and ambulatory species of carnivorous plants that could be found in parts of the Realms.\nThese plants were visually similar to a venus flytrap, but far larger and sturdier. They had thick, green, trunk-like stems and four sturdy vine-like tendrils. In addition to these tendrils, greenvises had tendril-like roots that they used to move around. When their jaws were closed they resembled a mundane leafy bush, but once opened they revealed their interior to be a  mottled pink and lined with tooth-like thorns.\nGreenvises had an innate ability to sense any object or creature within  that was in contact with vegetation. Additionally, at a rate of twice per day, if extremely hungry or injured greenvises would release a deathly acidic fog out to  that was so dense it severely limited the vision of other creatures.\nGreenvises were largely an opportunistic, ambush predators, due in part to their slow rate of movement. Whenever they recognized that prey was sparse in a particular area, a greenvise would proceed to reposition themselves throughout the day. They fought by using their tendrils to ensnare and pull prey towards the vise-like grip of their maw to swallow them whole.\nThese plants were generally only active during daylight hours, entering a state of rest during the night.\nGreenvises typically grew around hills, plains, or marshes in areas that had temperate to warm climates.\nSome fey were known to cultivate greenvises and it was not uncommon for stirges to lair near them.\nAround 1372 DR, swamp striders were counted among the many creatures that one could potentially encounter on a rare occasion while traversing the sewers of Waterdeep.\nFollowing the Spellplague, the inhabitants of the city of New Sharandar grew greenvise vines on their defensive wall, the Living Abatis."
