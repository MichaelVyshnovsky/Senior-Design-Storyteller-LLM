        "mainbody": "A '''stone colossus''', which was also called a '''statue-that-walked''', was an extremely rare and powerful form of [[stone golem]].",
        "Description": "These creations resembled extremely large stone golems.",
        "Combat": "These immensely powerful creations only attacked with their fists. They could only be harmed by [[enchanted]] weapons. A ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' [[spell]] would ''[[slow]]'' them for several minutes, while a ''[[transmute mud to rock]]'' spell would completely heal them. A ''[[flesh to stone]]'' spell did not cause them harm, but did allow mundane weapons to harm them while the spell was active. A stone colossus was immune to all other forms of [[magic]]. The mere sight of a marching stone colossus usually sent all enemies fleeing in terror.",
        "Behavior": "Once activated, a stone colossus reverted to its original programming that required it to destroy any edifice not constructed by its original creator. Supposedly there was a way to reprogram them, but this method was lost to history. They could be stopped from their rampage by a detailed ritual that lasted for days and involved placing special glyphs on all existing stone colossi.",
        "History": "The stone colossi were magical warriors created by a race of [[giant]]s who once inhabited the [[Old Empires]]."
