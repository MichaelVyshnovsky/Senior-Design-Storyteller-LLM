'''Riskin''' was a species of darting tiny brown-feathered [[bird]]s found in the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]], notably in the vicinity of [[Dathyl]].

==Ecology==
These chirping birds were small enough to fit in an adult [[human]]'s hand. Riskin were partial to delicious [[cavanter]] buds that grew in the King's Forest.

==History==
In [[1348 DR]], a small flock of riskins intruded on a morninefest of [[Florin Falconhand]] and [[Narantha Crownsilver]], fruitlessly trying to snatch a heaping leaf-full of their favorite cavanter buds gathered by Florin.
