Riskin was a species of darting tiny brown-feathered birds found in the Kings Forest of Cormyr, notably in the vicinity of Dathyl.
These chirping birds were small enough to fit in an adult humans hand. Riskin were partial to delicious cavanter buds that grew in the Kings Forest.
In 1348 DR, a small flock of riskins intruded on a morninefest of Florin Falconhand and Narantha Crownsilver, fruitlessly trying to snatch a heaping leaf-full of their favorite cavanter buds gathered by Florin.
