        "mainbody": "vulture drake, also known as a deathwing, was a type of drake that had been corrupted by the Shadowfell.\nThe drakes were large, menacing reptiles that could be used as mounts. The vulture drake was a gaunt winged creature with taut skin and a skeletal physique. It had long and unwieldy wings.\nA vulture drake would prefer to focus on a single target, swooping in and allowing itself to sustain a hit, since this would enable it to use its death shriek. Once a target was eliminated, the vulture drake would take off again in order to repeat the process.\nIn 1479 DR, some vulture drakes could be found in the company of Shadovar.\nThe vulture drake could commonly be found in the Shadowfell."
