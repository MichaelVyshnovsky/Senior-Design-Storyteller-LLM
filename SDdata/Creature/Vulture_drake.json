        "Description": "The drakes were large, menacing reptiles that could be used as mounts. The vulture drake was a gaunt winged creature with taut skin and a skeletal physique. It had long and unwieldy wings.",
        "Combat": "A vulture drake would prefer to focus on a single target, swooping in and allowing itself to sustain a hit, since this would enable it to use its death shriek. Once a target was eliminated, the vulture drake would take off again in order to repeat the process.",
        "History": "In [[1479 DR]], some vulture drakes could be found in the company of [[Shadovar]].",
        "Ecology": "The vulture drake could commonly be found in the [[Shadowfell]]."
