        "mainbody": "Taers () were medium-sized humanoids possibly related to giants.\nTaer typically dwelt in caves on frigid mountainous regions of the Unapproachable East, chief among them the Giantspire Mountains and Icerim Mountains. They were also known to inhabit the area around Icewind Dale. Taer traveled farthest from their homes during the winter season, pillaging whatever they come across, but in warmer seasons they kept to their mountain ranges.\nBeyond Toril, these creatures could be found on the planet of Oerth.\nLike many races in the North, the taer worshiped a number of spirits and mythical figures. Outside of their unique pantheon, most taers revered aspects of Auril the Frostmaiden and Loviatar. They have also been known to worship deities in the giant pantheon, such as Grolantor and Thrym.\n* Grrunk"
