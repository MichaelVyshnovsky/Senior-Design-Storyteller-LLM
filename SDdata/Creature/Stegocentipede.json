        "mainbody": "'''Stegocentipedes''' were large, unnatural insect-like creatures of unknown origin.",
        "Description": "Stegocentipedes largely resembled a [[monstrous centipede]]. However, their bodies were covered in two rows of spinal plates and their rear portion terminated in an elongated, heavily armored ball-like club appendage, both evocative of a [[stegosaurus]]. When not engaged in combat, these spinal plates were flattened along the creature's back.",
        "Biology": "Both the mandibles and club tail of the stegocentipede were laced in a form of [[poison]].",
        "Combat": "When engaged in combat the spinal plates of a stegocentipede would become erect and the creature would attempt to ram them into their opponents. Beyond this, the rapidly moving creatures would attempt to seize creatures with their poisonous mandibles or lash at them with their tail.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], the [[Beast Lord]] was known to have created a number of stegocentipedes in the ruins of [[Dekanter]].\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they could be found in much of [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Ecology": "Stegocentipedes were often known to be created by the Beast Lord servants of [[Malar]].<ref>",
        "Myths & Rumors": "Some speculated that the stegocentipede may have originated on another [[plane]]."
