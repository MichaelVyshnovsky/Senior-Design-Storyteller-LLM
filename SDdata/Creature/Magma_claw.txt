'''Magma claws''' were one of the two more bestial species of [[magma beast]].

==Description==
These creatures bore a resemblance to [[scorpion]]s, but had only four legs and a stubby tail.

==Abilities==
Like all magma beasts, claws were immune to the effects of petrification, had some resistance to [[fire]], and were particularly vulnerable to cold-based [[spell]]s and abilities.

They could uniquely disgorge lava out from their claws.

==Combat==
Magma claws preferred to ambush they prey, hiding in plain sight by posing as mere hunks of volcanic rock. When they felt their opportunity had come a magma claw would rush towards their prey and immobilize it by pouring out sticky lava around its legs. They would then attempt to bludgeon their prey to death with their fiery claws.

==History==
Following the [[Spellplague]], many magma claws made their way through [[elemental vortex|elemental vortices]] and planar rifts into volcanic regions of [[Toril]]'s surface and the [[Underdark]]. magma claws could be found inhabiting [[Mount Hotenow]].

Also late into the 15{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s on the continent of [[Laerakond]] prevented the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]] from conducting a ritual to awaken the sleeping [[Dawn Titan]] named [[Achazar]] that would have sacrificed the residents of the port-city [[Tarmalune]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|4}} In the wake of the failed ritual, magma claws and other elementals crossed over from the Plane of Fire and sought to destroy the adventurers as they tried to flee to Tarmalune.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|10}}

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Magma claws could subsist on merely clay, ores, and even minor elementals. Though they preferred to hunt and feast upon organic creatures, savoring the taste of burned flesh. Whenever they killed a [[humanoid]] they would devour them whole, including their equipment.
===Habitats===
These creatures were native to the [[Elemental Chaos]], but could occasionally be found in [[Avernus]]<ref> and on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].
===Languages===
Like all magma beasts, claws were capable of speaking the [[Primordial language]].
===Relationships===
Magma claws were occasionally bullied by [[magma brute]]s and [[magma hurler]]s into fighting alongside them. They were also often lured into serving [[fire archon]]s, [[fire giant]]s, [[salamander]]s, and even the occasional [[eye of flame]].
