A hakeashar was a type of nishruu, similar to them in many ways.
They were a subspecies of nishruu and found in the Old Empires of Mulhorand, Unther, and Chessenta. They were identical with nishruus in almost every way except for their appearance.
Hakeashars had hundreds of grasping claws, piercing eyes and outstretched fanged mouths among the globular blood-red mist. Thus, hakeashars had a more horrific appearance and thus naturally could fill their foes with horror.
Hakeashars were slightly more powerful than their nishruu cousins they had more powerful attacks, higher health, and immunity to standard weapons. Thus, it required a more powerful mage to summon one.
