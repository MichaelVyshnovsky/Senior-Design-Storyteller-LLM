'''Koalinths''', also known as '''sea [[hobgoblin]]s''' were a savage undersea race which  inhabited the [[Inner Sea]].

==Description==
Koalinths were similar to hobgoblins in appearance, but were very brightly colored and possessed gills.{{Cite dragon/68/Featured Creatures|39-40}}

==Personality==
Koalinth were known for a great ferocity similar to that of normal hobgoblins. They held a strong hatred of [[elves]], deep enough to affect their decisions to forge alliances.

==Abilities==
===Biology===
Unlike the majority of aquatic races, koalinths were equally able to breath freshwater and saltwater without difficulty.

==Combat==
Koalinth were as diligent in matters of warfare as their land-dwelling cousins. They shared their martial skill and ability to see in the dark. They were amphibious but normally moved slower in the water than they did on land. Like many seafaring races, they wielded tridents so as to better fight in aquatic settings.

Koalinth sergeants focused on the most crucial battlefield threats. They were faster underwater than other koalinths and used hooked nets to capture important enemies, and were especially skilled in putting down these foes when restrained.

==Society==
Like normal hobgoblins, koalinth society was highly structured and militaristic. Koalinth lairs were located in underwater sea caverns, grottoes, and shallow fresh water caves. Koalinth societies were run by chiefs and subchiefs with shamans beneath them. Sergeants conducted routine military operations with normal koalinth soldiers.
===Languages===
Koalinths spoke theirÂ own distinct dialect of the [[Hobgoblin language|Hobgoblin tongue]].{{Cite dragon/250/Heroes of the Sea|29}}
===Relationships===
Some koalinths made use of guard beasts, using [[giant crayfish]] in freshwater and [[sea lion]]s in salt water. Though they preyed upon many aquatic [[humanoid]]s and [[demihuman]]s, they especially detested [[aquatic elves]].

Some acted as servants of the [[marid]] [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].
