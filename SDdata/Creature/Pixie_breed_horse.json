Circa the , these creatures were used by heralds of the city-state of Sumbria. One such herald was sent to negotiate peace following the disastrous battle in the Valley of Umbricci in the early fall. The herald was murdered by the conniving Colletrans under the rule of their new Prince-elect Ugo Svar√©zi."
