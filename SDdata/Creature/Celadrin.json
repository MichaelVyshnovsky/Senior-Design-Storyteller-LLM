        "mainbody": "[[Celadrin]] were a [[planetouched]] race that resulted from the union of [[elves]] and [[celestial eladrin|eladrins]] (usually [[firre]]). Many of the celadrins encountered outside of their homes were warriors, though they were also known for their skill as [[bard]]s.",
        "Description": "Celadrins were of medium height and size. Celadrins resembled [[sun elves]] with the same golden-colored skin, but they also possessed gold eyes and flame-red hair. They preferred to wear brilliant robes, oftentimes fine silk with touches of [[silver]] and [[gold]].",
        "Abilities": "Known to be quite dexterous and charismatic, but with a frail constitution, celadrins had a number of useful abilities. They could see in the dark and had resistance to fire and ''[[sleep]]'' spells and effects. They possessed a fiery gaze that let them occasionally cast a ''[[scorching ray]]'' from their eyes. They were most notable for their melodious voice however, which could influence beasts and humanoids alike.\n\nSome rumors suggested that [[warlock]] bloodlines existed among the celadrin of [[Cormanthor]],{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Warlocks, Part 1}} a rare example of warlock bloodlines among good races.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Warlocks, Part 2}} The mixed blood of elves and eladrin seemed responsible for these powers.",
        "Society": "Celadrins were usually found living with sun elves, although a few were known to wander the world before eventually settling down in distant elven settlements. They usually lived in communities with prominent temples to [[Hanali Celanil]], and tended to venerate her as their patron deity, though they worshiped the entire Seldarine pantheon as well.\n\nWhen forced to fight, they were cautious warriors who tried to first learn as much of their enemy as possible. They then used that to find the most optimum time and location to fight, using ambushes, stealth, and hit-and-run tactics. Celadrins preferred to use [[longsword]]s, [[rapier]]s, and [[longbow]]s and [[shortbow]]s in a melee fight, and their wizards often used ''sleep'' spells due to their kin's resistance.\n\nOther than reproducing amongst themselves, celadrins also propagated from the union of elves with eladrin, typically during the height of the summer solstice and consummated at Hanali Celanil's more wild revels.",
        "History": "It was said that many celadrins could trace their origin back to the height of [[Myth Drannor]], a time of liberation and understanding. After the fall of Myth Drannor, celadrins moved to [[Deepingdale]] and [[Lake Sember]]. They also originated from other communities with prominent temples to Hanali Celanil, such as [[Evermeet]] and [[Evereska]].\n\nThe [[Church of the Winsome Rose]] had celadrin warlocks among its defenders. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], at least three had became [[eldritch theurge]]s, who tried to restore love among elven races in Cormanthor.\n\nDuring the same time period, one celadrin was also known to be a member of the [[Kaliesh'erai]], a [[psionic]] elven organization located in [[Evereska]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}"
