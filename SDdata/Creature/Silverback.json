        "Ecology": "Silverback fish were abundant in Imnestream's cold rushing waters, where it was a common catch during fishing seasons. Along with [[bluefin]]s, silverbacks were fished via nets or [[spear]]s. Imnestream's narrow channels and plungepools were perfect for silverback fishing as the river's rapid waters forced them into certain spots of calmer water."
