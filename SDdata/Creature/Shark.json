        "mainbody": "Sharks were aggressive carnivorous fish. They could be found hunting alone or in groups and were known for attacking anyone approaching them without provocation.\nAll shark species were utterly fierce, aggressive, and fearless. They were relentlessly hungry.\nSharks were tactical hunters, using their keen senses to circle their prey just outside of their field of view and charging to attack at the most opportune moment. Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth were effective against many different targets, sometimes even ship hulls.\nThese creatures had been swimming in the oceans for thousands of years with little change in their appearance or methods.\nSharks were categorized into medium, large, and huge species.\nReef sharks the species of shark that usually inhabited shallow waters and coral reefs. They hunted in packs.\nGoblin sharks the species of ugly deepwater sharks, vicious predators that could be found in the deepest parts of the seas.\nMako sharks the most agile and fierce of their kind. They hunted in packs akin to their reef cousins.\nHammerhead sharks the species of shark notorious for their agility and their distinct hammer-like head shape.\nLarge sharks included hunter sharks that preyed on deep waters, and fleshtearer sharks, which were found in various environments, including underground rivers and lakes.\nDire Shark The second largest species of the shark in the Realms, they behaved in a similar manner to great whites. They were prone to attacking anything that they perceived to be edible, no matter how large.\nGreat White Also known as \"huge sharks\" or \"giant sharks,\" they were the third largest type of shark in the Realms. This species could be found in deep oceans and attacked anything that approached them, including whales and ships.\nMegalodon An ancient and monstrous species of shark, sometimes known as \"giant sharks\". They were one of the largest species of shark in the Realms.\nthumb|A freshly-caught shark in Baldurs Gate.\nThe smaller types of sharks were very common in the waters surrounding Chult. The Bay of Chult and Refuge Bay contained large groups of reef sharks. Hunter sharks and reef sharks hunted off the coast of Ishau, as well as Jahaka Anchorage. In the Shining Sea, they lurked in the sunken ruins of Untisczer. \nMako, goblin, and hammerhead sharks lived and hunted in the close vicinity of the Temple-Under-The-Sea, the submerged temple to Umberlee in the Fiddlers Green underwater region of the Sea of Swords.\nOutside of the Prime Material plane, sharks were extremely prevalent in Draga Salt-Biters domain of Saragoss in the Domains of Dread.\nSharks were revered by sahuagin and could be trained by them. Their kinship to sahuagin was so strong that even wild sharks considered them allies and did not attack them. Sahuagin could also telepathically issue commands to nearby sharks.\nKalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari had a wide variety of sharks as servants in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold shark hides for 15 gp a piece.\n* Sekolah, shark god of the sahuagin."
