        "mainbody": "A lammasu () was a noble and stern magical beast that looked like a cross between a lion and an eagle. Lammasus sought to promote goodness throughout the world, living in isolated ruins and abandoned temples.\nA lammasu had the body of a lion, the wings of a giant eagle, and the face of a human. They were capable of flight.\nThe average lammasu measured  in length and weighed about .\nLammasus were creatures who preferred isolation but concerned themselves with the well-being of good creatures in general. Their outwardly stern demeanor belied their capacity for compassion. They were cordial in nature towards other good creatures and were often willing to assist them in combating evil. According to some they would attack evil creatures on sight, while others gave evil creatures a chance to leave their lairs, firmly asking them to go.\nthumb|A lammasu in all its magnificence.\nAccording to early scholars, all lammasu possessed an innate ability to turn themselves invisible and dimension door at will. Their bodies also radiated an aura similar to the spell protection from evil, 10 radius. However, later scholars claimed that a lammasu was limited to using greater invisibility on itself up to twice per day and dimension door once per day. They also possessed a limited form of telepathy.\nLammasu could cast divine magic, including spells from the good, healing, knowledge, and law domains. All lammasu knew the spells cure critical wounds and cure serious wounds, whilst only a small percentage of them knew the spell holy word.\nBeyond their use of priestly spells, lammasu fought by use of their sharp front claws. In some circumstances, they would use their telepathy to communicate with nearby lammasu to ask for aid.\nGreater lammasu Slightly larger than the common lammasu, these creatures possessed a greater array of abilities. They had the power to teleport without error at will, as well as the power to travel the Astral and Ethereal planes. Additionally, their protection from aura radiated out to , over 50 percent of them knew holy word, and they possessed the psionic powers empathy and telepathic communication.\nLammasu organized themselves in prides, much like lions. Their societies were very structured, reflective of their lawful good nature, and lead by one or two greater lammasu. They worked to keep down the population of evil creatures in their area, often protecting frontier settlements.\nOnce a month, on the night of a full moon, all pride leaders within a given area would meet up in an event called \"the Whitemoon\". There they would discuss until dawn how their ongoing efforts to combat evil were going. According to many accounts, their collective presence would cause a bright glow to emanate from their meeting spot.\nLammasu were commonly found on the Prime Material within temperate and warm climates, such as in deserts, where they made their homes in old abandoned temples that they considered themselves to be the guardians of. Their communities were always spread out from each other at a distance of .\nIn the Gulthmere Forest, lammasu could be found living on the Machran Spire most of the year.\nBeyond the Prime Material, lammasu were most commonly found in Mount Celestia, the divine realm of the Pridelands in the Beastlands, and in the divine realm of Merratet, wherein existed a whole village of lammasu. Additionally, both lesser and greater lammasu could also be found within the Ethereal Plane, though only the latter could be encountered in the Astral.\nIn addition to speaking their own language, lammasu commonly spoke the Common Tongue, Celestial, and Draconic. Greater lammasu additionally knew how to speak the limited lawful good tongue.\nThese creatures generally harbored a strong emnity towards lamias and manticores, the latter especially as it was not uncommon for those less familiar with lammasu to misidentify them as being manticores.\nThey served as servants for a variety of different deities across the Realms, including Arvoreen, Cyrrollalee, Horus-Re, Isis, Osiris, Solonor Thelandira, Torm, and Yondalla. They were most strongly associated with Nobanion, who was sometimes depicted as a lammasu himself and whose church considered both lesser and greater lammasu to be members of the clergy.\nA tuft of fur from a lammasu was required as a material component for the Nobanionite spell lionheart.\nIn , a number of lammasu defeated a much larger force of Aearee-Krocaa, killing one thousand."
