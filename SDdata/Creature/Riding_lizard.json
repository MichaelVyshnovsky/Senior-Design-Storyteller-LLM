        "mainbody": "'''Riding lizards''' were a common species of large, sleek subterranean reptiles that were used as [[mount]]s by most of the major races of the [[Underdark]],<ref> in particular the [[drow]], as well as a food source by other creatures of the Underdark.",
        "Description": "Riding lizards were large, roughly comparable in size to a [[horse]],{{Cite web/Drow Pets and Animal Companions}} but smaller than a [[pack lizard]]. Their legs were splayed wide They typically walked on all fours, much like a [[newt]] or [[monitor lizard]],",
        "Behavior": "[[File:Ebon Riding Lizard.jpg|thumb|''An ebon riding lizard from the Underdark.''|330x330px]]\nRiding lizards preferred to take to the walls and ceiling rather than travel on the ground where predators could more easily track them.\n\nDrow often used magical means of compulsion in the training and use of riding lizards so that they would be both fearless and perfectly obedient.",
        "Abilities": "Riding lizards had a very keen balance. Due to their diets, the species had built up an immunity to [[poison]]s of arachnids, centipedes, and other insects, as well as all fungal spores. Trained riders could stay seated when their mount was upside-down. They had [[infravision]] up to {{SI|160|ft|long=yes}}, but they were susceptible to partial blindness due to bright light, though some could not see in the dark and instead relied upon their keen sense of smell.",
        "Combat": "Riding lizards could bite, kick with their hind legs, and jump up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} horizontally and {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} upwards.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Riding lizards were an omnivorous species, noted for eating [[snake]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[rat]]s, [[lichen]], and [[fungi]].",
            "Relationships": "Many riding lizards were raised in captivity by drow, who occasionally captured wild specimens (typically by use of [[spell]]s) in order to vary their bloodlines. It took over a year of training to make a riding lizard fully obedient to more than one rider and follow silent directions. A finely trained mount could sell for as high as 1,000 [[gold piece]]s, though most only went for around 600 or 700 gp, while young and untrained riding lizards typically sold for around 200 to 500 gp.\n\nThough they were seen as being most advantageous for traversing the Underdark, such as [[Vhaeraunan]]s on their [[Sel√ªne (moon)|new moon]] [[stag]] hunts.\n\nMost drow noble houses had at least a few riding lizards, with the larger houses able to support whole squadrons of riding lizard cavalry armed with [[crossbow]]s carrying poisoned [[bolt]]s. Many ''[[drow house insignia]]s'' were also magically enspelled to control riding lizard mounts.\n\nBeyond the drow, riding lizards were commonly used as mounts by [[gold dwarves]]<ref> and the [[shield dwarves]] of [[Iltkazar]].<ref> They were raised by [[duergar]] across much of the [[Middledark]],<ref> who considered riding lizard meat a staple of their diet. Comparatively, drow would only ever eat those who died of misfortunate circumstances."

        "History": "Around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Vhurn Bhaelyndryn's Bestiary]] in the bazaar of [[Menzoberranzan]] was known to supply riding lizards and their associated gear. Also around this time, the city of [[Ched Nasad]] supplied riding lizards to surface-dwelling drow in the [[Dalelands]] through means of the [[Ched Nasad portal]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Dark Elf Portals: The Ched Nasad Portal}}\n\n''Circa'' [[1480 DR]], [[Vhurn Bhaelyndryn|Vhurn]]'s establishment was still supplying riding lizards to denizens of the Underdark.",
