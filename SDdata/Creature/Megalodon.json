        "mainbody": "'''Megalodons''', occasionally known as '''giant sharks''', were an ancient monstrous species of white [[shark]].",
        "Description": "These monstrous sharks were some of the largest predators in the ocean. They ranged in sizes of {{SIrange|20|65|ft|long=yes}} in length, with the larger sizes being more prevalent in ancient times, and weighed between {{SIrange|10|60|tons|k}}. Some were rumored to even reach lengths of {{SIrange|80|90|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "Much like other sharks, megalodons were constantly in motion and driven by a voracious appetite. They were attracted by noises and would attack any creature they perceived as being edible.\n\nMegalodons would go into frenzies when blood was in their watery habitats. However, whenever this occured it was due to fishermen or other creatures hunting large aquatic life like [[whale]]s. This is because their habit of swallowing prey whole almost never left any blood in the ocean.",
        "Abilities": "Megalodons had very keen senses. They could smell from up to a {{SI|1|mile|long = yes}} away and sense motions from up to the same distance. They also could see around itself in a radius of {{SI|180|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nThese sharks could leap as high as {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} out of the water. Much like other species of shark, megalodons needed to be constantly moving in order to force sufficient oxygen-rich water through their gills. Thus they would die if held immobile for a prolonged period. The other natural weakness of sharks shared by this species was that their thick, flexible cartilage tissue offered poor protection for their internal organs.",
        "Combat": "Megalodons were more effective at grappling their prey than other species of shark and were capable of swallowing most things whole with their massive jaws.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The grand king of all [[sahuagin]] was rumored to possess a massive megalodon as a [[mount]] and guardian.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Megalodons were a carnivorous species. They were capable of swallowing some species of whale whole and would leap out of the water to bite at low-flying [[roc]]s. They were even known to attack members of their own species.",
            "Habitats": "Beyond [[Toril]], these creatures inhabited the planets of [[Armistice]] and [[Thalassa]].\n\nOutside of the [[Prime Material plane]], there were [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] megalodons that inhabited an ocean within the [[Gaping Maw]] layer of the [[Abyss]]. They could also occasionally be found in [[Draga Salt-Biter]]'s domain of [[Saragoss]] in the [[Domains of Dread]].",
            "Relationships": "[[Dragon]]s were among the few creatures that megalodons were known to yield towards, though even then some would leap out of the water and bite at low-flying ones."
        },
        "Notable Megalodons": "* [[Iakhovas]], an ancient [[wereshark]] megalodon that was known for his highly destructive attacks on several coastal cities, including [[Waterdeep]].\n* [[Obliteros]], an [[awaken]]ed giant shark who hunted in the depths of [[Deepwater Harbor]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
