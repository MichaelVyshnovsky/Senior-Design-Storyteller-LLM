        "mainbody": "lass spiders were a large breed of spiders that had entirely translucent bodies.\nThe translucent bodies of these spiders were white in coloration. Though translucent, only the internal organs of their abdomen were visible from the outside.\nLike many spider species, the glass spider carried a poisonous bite. They were uniquely able to temporarily make themselves invisible.\nGlass spiders typically laid eggs in clutches of four. These eggs contained a sort of arsenic, which would spray out and poison anyone that broke them open.\nThese creatures could be found in the Demonweb Pits and on the planet of Eberron."
