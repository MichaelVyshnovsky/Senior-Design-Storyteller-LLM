        "mainbody": "Massospondylus, also known as massopondylus (), was a species of dinosaur.\nMassospondylus had long teeth that were very sharp. They also had long, sharp claws on their five-fingered hands, with a large spike at the end of their thumb.\nMassospondylus were known for not being very intelligent. \nMassospondylus used their sharp teeth as a defensive weapon, biting quickly before making their escape. They were among the favored prey of several carnosaurs such as allosaurus, deinonychus and tyrannosaurus.\nMassospondylus were herbivores and lived in herds. Similar to some avian species, they consumed stones which aided their digestion of vegetation."
