        "Description": "Massospondylus had long teeth that were very sharp. They also had long, sharp claws on their five-fingered hands, with a large spike at the end of their thumb.",
        "Behaviour": "Massospondylus were known for not being very intelligent.",
        "Combat": "Massospondylus used their sharp teeth as a defensive weapon, biting quickly before making their escape. They were among the favored prey of several carnosaurs such as [[allosaurus]], [[deinonychus]] and [[tyrannosaurus]].",
        "Biology": "Massospondylus were herbivores and lived in herds. Similar to some avian species, they consumed stones which aided their digestion of vegetation."
