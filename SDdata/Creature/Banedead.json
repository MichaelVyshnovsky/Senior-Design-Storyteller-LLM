        "mainbody": "'''Banedead''', also referred to as '''Claws of Xvim''', '''Promised Ones''' or the '''Shriveled Dead of Bane''', were a type of [[undead]] creatures that appeared in [[Faerûn]] for a brief time after the [[Time of Troubles]]. They were closely associated with the worship of the deity [[Bane]] and his [[church of Bane|church of followers]].",
        "Description": "Banedead appeared as decaying [[humanoid]]s that were completely stripped of any appearance of natural life. After being risen, the corpse underwent a partial transformation befitting an undead servant of Bane. Their eyes glowed with malevolent red light, and one of their hands grew and twisted into a horrific claw.",
        "Abilities": "They were immune to [[spell]]s and abilities that attempted to, ''[[Hold monster|hold them in place]]'', ''[[sleep|put them to sleep]]'', or ''[[charm|charm them]]''. They could not be swayed by [[illusion|illusion magic]], mind-altering effects or harmed by any sort of [[poison]].{{Cite web enhancement/A Call to Arms|7}} They had few weak points, and could shrug off hits that would destroy most other monsters.",
        "Combat": "When a banedead's malformed claw struck an opponent it sapped away their sense of agility and finesse, until they were left completely ''[[paralyze]]d''.\n\nIn battle, banedead were particularly dangerous relative to most other forms of undead because they retained much of their mortal intelligence. They always sought out holy champions as their first victims. While they preferred [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s above most others, the sight of [[Cyricist]]s made them incensed. They tried to rend followers of the Dark Sun with intense fervor.\n\nThey could only be harmed by ''[[Item enchantment|enchanted]]'' weapons.",
        "Ecology": "[[File:Banedead MCA3.png|thumb|right|250px|One of Bane's unholy dead.]]\nBanedead were created by means of a unique [[ritual]] that could only be lead by a powerful priest of Bane or his divine son [[Iyachtu Xvim]], performed upon one of those deity's holy sites. These rituals often involved large groups of the faithful. The priest would transform willing devotees into one of these terrifying undead monstrosities, often converting a dozen at a time.\n\nControl of a banedead could be transferred from its creator to a [[wizard]], typically a member of the [[Zhentarim]]. If banedead were [[Turn undead|turned]] by a rival or enemy cleric, the cleric or wizard who controlled them risked losing their power over the banedead.",
        "History": "It was said that banedead wandered around [[Zhentil Keep]] following Bane's death following the [[Time of Troubles]]. They were believed to have been seeking out and slaying any follower who had strayed to another faith.\n\nBy the time of Bane's return in [[1372 DR]], banedead in service to the Zhentarim were active all across [[Faerûn]], from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Thay]], actively seeking out followers of [[Cyric]]. [[Fzoul Chembryl]] was said to have a dozens of banedead under his direct control."
