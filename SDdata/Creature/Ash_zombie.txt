An ash zombie was a special type of undead created by the powerful energies released in the wake of the eruption of Mount Hotenow, in 1451 DR.
Many ash zombies appeared quite small&mdashno larger than a child or a halfling&mdashowing to how their intense heat caused their bodies to shrivel.
Ash zombies were normal undead warped and mutated by the powerful energies released by the eruption of Mount Hotenow.
Ash zombies were capable of creating unnatural ashes from their bodies and using them as a weapon. When attacked, a puff of this ash might erupt from the ash zombie.
Ash zombies first appeared after the eruption of Mount Hotenow.
When the Red Wizards of Thay discovered them, around 1463 DR, they began to research ways to create ash zombies artificially. They also discovered that ash zombies developed a taste for younger victims.
Around 1479 DR, ash zombies were common in the abandoned parts of Neverwinter, and in Thundertree.
