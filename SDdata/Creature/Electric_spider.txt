An '''electric spider''' was a large type of [[spider]] that attacked with ''[[lightning bolt]]s''.

==Combat==
These large spiders were completely immune to lightning-based attacks. The preferred to seek out foes in narrow corridors, so they could send out a lightning bolt, hitting multiple foes. They also had no problem with the bolt bouncing back at them, as they could totally resist its effects.

==Ecology==
Electric spiders could sometimes be found in [[Leilon]], [[Port Llast]], and the [[Tower of Twilight]]. They were also known to dwell in the realm of [[Kalistes]], as well as in the [[Underdark]].
