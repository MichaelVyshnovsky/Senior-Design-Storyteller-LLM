        "Description": "Wood element creatures could have the general form of just about any corporeal animal, [[magical beast]], [[vermin]] or monster, but their bodies were made entirely of wood and other plant material, such as leaves. They all shared opal-like black eyes. Their claws were like jagged splinters.",
        "Abilities": "Wood element creatures had many immunities, including immunity to mind-influencing effects, paralysis, poison, polymorphing, and stunning. They did not require sleep and had no discernible internal anatomies. Their wooden bodies gave them some protection from physical attacks. Their black eyes gave them the ability to [[Darkvision|see in the dark]].\n\nWood element creatures moved along the ground much more slowly than their [[Prime Material plane|Material Plane]] counterparts, but there were reports of wood creatures being able to climb, swim, or even fly.\n\nAll wood element creatures had the somewhat disturbing ability to project shards or spikes of wood from their bodies, launching such projectiles up to 40 yards (37 meters). They could also sense the presence of other beings currently touching any plants in their vicinity.",
        "Society": "These beings inhabitant all manner of climates and terrains within the [[House of Nature]], one of the [[Neutral Planes]] within the [[World Tree cosmology]].\n\nMost wood element creatures had only animal intelligence, but those that were more intelligent could speak [[Sylvan]] and [[Treant]] and carried a [[Neutral|balanced outlook on life]]."
