        "mainbody": "'''Deathlocks''' were [[undead]] [[spellcaster]]s bound to serve a master. They were usually the remains of [[warlocks]], reanimated by their patrons after failing to fulfill their part of a pact, but could also be created by [[necromancer]]s.",
        "Personality": "Deathlocks did not have any goals that they had in life, aside from fulfilling their patron's desires. This urge to serve their patron was overpowering and consumed their every thought.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Masterminds": "Deathlock masterminds had access to a larger arsenal of spells than the average deathlock. These additional spells typically included ''[[blight]]'', ''[[counterspell]]'', ''[[crown of madness]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[minor illusion]]'', and ''[[poison spray]]''. Though again, this arsenal could vary widely depending upon what patron they had.\n\nBesides spells, a deathlock mastermind was capable of shooting necrotic bolts at their enemies.",
            "Patron Spells": "Those with with an [[Archfey patron]] were capable of casting the spells ''[[blink]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''hunger of Hadar'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'', and ''[[sleep]]''. In addition to these, a mastermind had access to the spells ''[[dominate beast]]'', ''[[dominate person]]'', and ''[[greater invisibility]]'', and ''[[seeming]]''.\n\nThose with a [[Fiend patron]] were capable of casting the spells ''[[blindness/deafness]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[hellish rebuke]]'', and ''[[scorching ray]]''. In addition to these, a mastermind had access to the spells ''[[fire shield]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''.\n\nThose with a [[Great Old One patron]] were capable of casting the spells ''[[armor of Agathys]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[dissonant whispers]]'', ''hunger of Hadar'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', and ''phantasmal force''. In addition to these, a mastermind had access to the spells ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''dominate person'', ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', ''[[sending]]'', and ''[[telekinesis]]''.",
            "Wight": "Deathlock wights were sensitive to the light of [[the sun]] and could drain the life from living creatures. Those slain by their draining touch would arise as a [[zombie]] under its command. And much like a mastermind, they could shoot necrotic bolts.\n\nThey lacked the spells of their living counterparts, though could cast the trio of spells that all deathlocks could innately do. In addition, deathlock wights could innately cast ''[[fear]]'', ''hold person'', and ''[[misty step]]''."

        "Variants": {
            "Masterminds": "Deathlock masterminds were deathlocks that had been granted more freedom and power, as they were also charged with recruiting and commanding others to serve their patrons' goals.",
            "Wights": "Deathlock wights were deathlocks that had been punished by certain types of patrons or necromancers by being transformed into husks of their former selves, halfway between a warlock and a [[wight]]."
        },
        "History": "In [[1479 DR]], [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] potentially raised the [[Neverwinter Nine]] as deathlock wights and [[wight|unhallowed wights]]."
