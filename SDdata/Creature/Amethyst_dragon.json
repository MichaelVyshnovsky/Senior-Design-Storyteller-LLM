        "mainbody": "'''Amethyst dragons''' were a breed of [[gem dragon]] known for their wise and regal manner and their similarity to [[amethyst]].",
        "Description": "Amethyst dragons had skin that was lavender in hue and scales shaped like naturally formed mineral crystals. On a [[dragon aging|hatchling]], these scales were small, translucent, and light purple, but as they aged they became steadily darker and more crystalline in appearance. An adult appeared a sparkling lavender. A hatchling had a {{SIAdj|2|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} body and {{SIAdj|4|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} tail, while an adult had a body length of {{SIrange|53|68|ft|long=yes}} and a tail length of {{SIrange|46|56|ft|long=yes}}. The biggest great wyrms grew to {{SI|132|ft|long=yes}} long in the body, with tails {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} long.\n\nA dragon egg could be identified as amethyst by the purple tinge seen when held in front of an intense white light, though it shared this trait with [[shadow dragon]] and [[deep dragon]] eggs.<ref>",
        "Personality": "They were considered wise and majestic even by dragon standards. But they were aloof and paid little heed to conflicts between [[good]] and [[evil]] or [[chaos]] and [[law]], as they believed them to be but petty squabbles. They favored talking things out rather than fighting, but considered retreating, ambushing, and hiding to be dishonorable.",
        "Abilities": "Different kinds of dragon breath were reported for amethysts. Some shrieked like a [[banshee]], with its attendant lethal power, but they could only do so twice a day. Others projected a line of force with concussive effect that could either stun or injure beings caught within. Finally, sometimes in addition to a line of force, once per day an adult could spit a kind of explosive crystal or faceted [[gem]] of violet with a lozenge shape. They could launch it up to {{SI|75|ft|long=yes}} and with perfect aim, usually into the ranks of their foes. It exploded on impact with concussive force, harming all in a radius of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} or {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. It could knock down creatures smaller than the dragon and knock them unconscious for a few hours. \n\nAmethyst dragons were highly resistant to, if not entirely immune, to [[:Category:Force_spells|force-based spells]], like ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', ''[[Otiluke's resilient sphere]]'', the ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' spells, and similar [[magic item]]s like ''[[bead of force|beads of force]]''.\n\nIn addition to common dragon and gem dragon immunities, amethyst dragons were reported to be immune to [[poison]]s and to have an innate ability to [[water breathing|breathe underwater]] they were born with, though this latter ability was later believed to be unique to [[topaz dragon]]s.\n\nLike any dragon, and in addition to the common powers of gem dragons, amethysts gained an array of magical powers as they aged. In one version, young dragons could [[water walking|walk on water]] six times a day; juveniles could [[neutralize poison]] six times a day; adults could [[shapechange]] into an [[animal]] three times a day ([[bird]], [[reptile]], or mammal, but only once of each type); old dragons could use ''Otiluke's resilient sphere'' thrice a day; very old dragons could create a [[reflecting pool]]; and venerable dragons could [[control weather]] once a day. Alternatively, juveniles could [[stomp]] their feet on the ground to create a shockwave that would knock over those within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in front of them, thrice a day. An adult gained the power of [[invisibility]] once a day. An old dragon could alter its [[body equilibrium]] to match that of solids or liquids, allowing them to walk (not run) on water, [[quicksand]], and even spider's webs if there were any large enough, without sinking or breaking the surface, and reduce their weight in a fall, once a day. Ancient dragons gained the power of [[suggestion]] once a day.  \n\nIn particular, amethyst dragon could use a unique form of [[telekinesis]], It was also useful in reshaping their environments.{{Cite dragon/218/Dragon Intrigues|18}}\n\nSimilarly, amethyst dragons could acquire and cast new spells of their own, whether arcane or divine, but they were most noted for their talent in [[psionics]]. Those who were so gifted learned the psionic attacks ''[[psionic blast]]'', ''[[ego whip]]'', or ''[[psychic crush]]'' and the psionic defenses ''[[mind blank (psionic)|mind blank]]'' or ''[[mental barrier]]'', ''[[thought shield]]'', or ''[[tower of iron will]]''. For general powers, they favored [[psychokinesis]] as their primary discipline and [[psychometabolism]] as a secondary discipline, followed by [[telepathy]]. Common psychokinesis powers were ''[[control body]]'', ''[[detonate]]'', ''[[inertial barrier]]'', ''[[molecular agitation]]'', ''[[project force]]'', and ''[[telekinesis]]''; psychometabolism powers were ''[[cell adjustment]]'', ''[[complete healing]]'', ''[[energy containment]]'', ''[[expansion]]'', ''[[metamorphosis]]'', and ''[[reduction]]''; and telepathy powers were ''[[contact]]'', ''[[domination (psionic)|domination]]'', ''[[ESP (psionic)|ESP]]'', ''[[identity penetration]]'', ''[[mindlink]]'', ''[[mindwipe]]'', and ''[[truthear]]''. They also learned [[metapsionics]] powers like ''[[empower]]'', ''[[magnify]]'', ''[[psionic sense]]'', ''[[psychic drain]]'', ''[[psychic surgery]]'', and ''[[ultrablast]]''.\n\nThey were skilled in deception and stealth.",
        "Society": {
            "Lairs": "On the [[Material Plane]], amethyst dragons enjoyed making their lairs on the shores of lakes and pools such as [[Wikipedia:Tarn (lake)|tarns]] lying in remote places in highlands and mountains. They might even dwell in caves below the water in such places.\n\nHowever, a majority of amethyst dragons resided on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], in caverns carved out of the endless rock. These comprised numerous tunnels and chambers bedecked with crystals of all the colors of the rainbow.",
            "Lands": "Amethyst dragons could be encountered around the [[Stonelands]], and less commonly in the neighboring [[Goblin Marches]];<ref><ref> around [[Highstar Lake]] on the [[High Moor]];<ref> and in the rivers and lakes of [[Rashemen]].<ref>"
        },
        "Combat": "[[File:Amethyst_Dragon_CLB.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''An amethyst defending its lair with its terrible explosive crystal breath weapon.'']]\n{{Quote|At least it's a beautiful way to die.|[[Erinis]], the [[gloom stalker]], regarding an amethyst dragon.{{Cite MTG|CLB|160|[[Amethyst dragon|Amethyst Dragon]]|[[Piotr Dura]]}}}}\nAmethyst dragons avoided combat if they could and preferred to parley instead, but if this failed or they were forced, then they would fight. Nevertheless, they refused to hide from or ambush their foes, and saw retreating as dishonorable. Young ones were more likely to fly away from a fight, and adults only when defeat or death seemed inevitable. While some might think them cowards, they were merely cautious.<ref> They rarely retreated when they were defending their lairs or their young. \n\nOnce battle was joined, the amethyst dragon opened its breath weapon, followed by its magic and psionics. Younger dragons favored their breath, magic and psionics, and aerial assaults, while the older and bigger dragons got physical and used their weight with grabs, snatches, and crushes. Adult amethyst dragons preferred to use their ''invisibility'' and other powers to catch their opponents off-guard. Their ''telekinesis'' power or their explosive breath could be used to manipulate their environment or cause a landslide.",
        "Usage": "Amethyst dragon scales were known as \"teyastones\". The [[Sisterhood of the Oaks]], a band of [[ranger]]s dwelling in the [[Chondalwood]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], each carried a teyastone to bring them luck and as a symbol of the love they held for each other.<ref>",
        "History": "During the [[Dracorage]] of [[1373 DR]], amethysts and other gem dragons used their power to shift between planes to escape [[Toril]] entirely. They waited out the rage and afterward returned one by one to resume where they left off, but many encountered difficulties.",
