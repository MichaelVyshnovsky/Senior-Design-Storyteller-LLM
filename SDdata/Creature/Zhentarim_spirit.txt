'''Zhentarim spirits''' were the [[undead]] essence of [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]]s who met terrible ends at the hands of enemies or treacherous rivals.

==Description==
These semitransparent [[ghost]]s resembled [[spectre]]s, often to the demise for anyone underestimating them as such. A Zhentarim spirit formed a few days after its death and appeared how it did when it was slain.

==Personality==
These spirits were extremely vengeful, remaining on the [[Prime Material plane]] by their sheer will until a specific task was completed or vengeance was achieved. Zhentarim spirits were only created when a powerful wizard was slain. Though they were capable spellcasters in life, a Zhentarim spirit did not have access to the [[spell]]s it had once memorized.

A Zhentarim spirit would depart the Prime Material plane as soon as its killer was slain. There was no known way to trick a Zhentarim spirit by staging their killer's death.

==Combat==
Zhentarim spirits were not affected by things like [[holy water]] that typically had a great impact on the undead, nor could they be [[Turn undead|turned]]. Zhentarim spirits could become intangible or invisible whenever they wished, but needed to materialize in order to attack.

A Zhentarim spirit's strike drained the life from a target. This loss of life was permanent to the spirit's killer(s).

They were able to use an ability similar to the ''[[magic jar]]'' spell and possess others within half a mile. Only one person could be possessed at a time. The spirit needed to relinquish the possession in order to use their draining touch.

A Zhentarim spirit would reform after 100 days unless slain by a ''[[wish]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', or ''[[power word, kill]]''. With the exception of those three spells, Zhentarim spirits were immune to all other spells except ''[[magic missile]]'' and ''[[protection from evil]]''. Enchanted weapons were needed to harm them.

==History==
Many believed that the formation of Zhentarim spirits was linked to the magic some Zhentarim wizards used to extend their lives.
