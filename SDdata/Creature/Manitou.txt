'''Manitous''' were a type of [[loumara]] (disembodied [[demon]]ic spirits) that possessed natural creatures and [[fey]] beings to corrupt the environment.

==Description==
In their true forms, manitous manifested as ghostly thickets of thin vines, each covered in thorn and tipped with a fanged maw filled with wood-like teeth.

==Personality==
Manitous were possessed by the singular desire to consume the souls of nature's defenders, the [[dryad]]s. They took glee in the corruption of the wilderness, particularly in sylvan regions,{{Cite dragon/360/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince|20}}

==Abilities==
Manitous possessed the ability to summon a wide array of animals and plant monsters, could change the weather and affect the condition of nearby plants through their spell-like abilities. By inserting their phantasmal vines into the backs of creatures nearby, they could possess approximately eight animals, plants, and [[fey]] each. The vines could only be seen through [[truesight]] and linked their hosts together, requiring them to all stay within a mile of each other lest the manitou's connection be severed. Those under their control could be puppeteered, allowed to exercise their free will with the manitou's permission, or horrifically transformed.

The very presence of a manitou was frightening, especially to animals and fey, which tended to cower rather than run when within their supernatural aura. They could unleash their vines to rend the material world asunder by making them physical for brief intervals, with animals, [[elemental]]s, fey and plants being the most affected.

==Creation==
Manitous originated in the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 230: Dreaming Gulf|230{{th}} layer of the Abyss, the Dreaming Gulf]] from a pantheon of [[deity|deities']] dying dreams. The [[Demonomicon_of_Iggwilv_(column)|Demonomicon]] of [[Iggwilv]] speculated that they in particular came from the corrupted echoes of a dead goddess of fertility and nature.
