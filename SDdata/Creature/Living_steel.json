        "mainbody": "'''Living steel''' were highly adaptable creatures of pure brightly-reflective [[steel]] that fed on [[iron]] and lived in the vicinity of iron ore veins.",
        "Description": "Living steel usually took on a shape reminiscent of a [[humanoid]] made of shiny steel that moved with almost liquid grace.",
        "Abilities": "These metallic beings reflected light and light-based magics thrown at them, absorbed heat, and were immune to electricity. However, these immunities could be overcome by an immense amount of fire or electric damage done and needed to spend time reassembling their bodies together. Electricity simply traveled through living steel's conductive bodies, and fire liquified them, allowing them to change shapes much quicker than normal. The cold slowed the creatures down and immensely stifled their transformative abilities, making them vulnerable to normal weapons for two minutes.\n\nTheir bodies were completely unaffected by mundane and magic weapons weaker than ''+2 [[enchanted|enchantments]]''. When attacked with such implements of war, the weapons harmlessly slid off or through living steel bodies, leaving them unharmed and angry. Living steel bodies simply came back together where mundane weapons attempted to wound them.\n\nWhen creatures with ''[[infravision]]'' observed a living steel specimen, they appeared as a simple cold blue lump of metal, making them extremely hard to notice in the underground habitats.\n\nTheir malleable, almost [[ooze]]-like bodies allowed living steel to fit in tight places and even move through tiny cracks in a wall.",
        "Behavior": "Living steel were usually non-aggressive but capable of ferocious and aggressive zeal if provoked. Living steel were known to pursue their offenders mercilessly until their targets or the creatures themselves were dead.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Living steel bw.png|thumb|''A menacing living steel.'']]\nLiving steel were able to change their bodies into any weapon or shape at will. Even not being able to change color, this ability gave them an upper hand in combat, pursuit, or evasion. When they needed speed, living steel could assume the shape of a swift [[hound]]; when they needed to defend themselves, they could transform into humanoids with giant axes or blades for hands. However, living steel could not fly in any of the shapes they assumed, nor gained sensory benefits or other qualities of creatures they transformed into. With that in mind, their shapeshifting abilities were only limited by their body mass.\n\nIt took living steel a bit of time to finish its transformation. During that time, the creatures were vulnerable to normal weapons. Because of that weakness, living steel avoided changing shape in the heat of battle.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Relationships": "Living steel were known to serve several [[Toril]]ian deities, such as [[Helm]], [[Hoar]], and [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]]."
