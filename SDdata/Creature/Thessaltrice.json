        "mainbody": "Thessaltrices were one of the four known thessalmonsters, a species of crossbred hybrid creatures. A thessaltrice was the result of crossbreeding a thessalhydra and a cockatrice.\nThe thessaltrice looked almost identical to a thessalhydra. It had a large reptillian body, a long tail that ended in a pair of sharp pincers, and a large central mouth instead of a head. Surrounding this mouth were eight serpentine heads. Unlike other thessalmonsters, the eight heads of a thessaltrice resembled that of a cockatrice, not a hydra, and were covered in feathers. \nEach of the thessaltrices eight heads had the ability to petrify a target via physical contact. This petrifying ability was so powerful it extended into both the Astral and Ethereal planes. If one of the heads was severed from the body, it regrew over a period of ten days.\nEach of the serpentine heads acted independently and injected a poison with each bite. \nThessaltrices were found only in warm climates within jungles and swamps. They made their lair within caves.\nSome were known to be found in the land of Chult.\nJuvenile thessaltrices were sometimes used as guards. Thessaltrice eggs were worth up to 5,000 gp and a live juvenile up to 10,000 gp."
