        "mainbody": "Qnidar, more popularly known as vapor bats, were a feared species of bat-like creatures that inhabited the warmer reaches of Wildspace.\nThese creatures had a semi-crystalline hide, similar to that of a radiant dragon. They often flew in an erratic fashion, due to their thermal senses being confused by background heat, but were quite fast. Most qnidar were capable of flying  per hour after absorbing large quantities of their food source, comparable to the speed of some spelljammers.Qnidar are stated to have a movement speed comparable to that of a spelljammer with a ship rating of 3. Spelljammer AD&D Adventures in Space defines the movement speed of a spelljammer as  per round for every point of its ship s rating, or in other words  per hour, per ship rating.\nThese creatures had a low level of intellect and never engaged in combat for malicious reasons. Out of a sort of racial instinct, when on the verge of death a qnidar would seek to fly towards the nearest star so they could die from over-absorption, their bodies often getting pulled into the star afterwards.\nQnidar had an innate ability to sense, detect, and absorb heat energy, as well as to absorb light. They also could unleash a charged breath of hot air. This breath was harmless within the void of Wildspace, but would ignite in an atmospheric envelope, such as that found in a spelljammer, creating a  cone of flame that was  wide at its end. If they were to unleash their breath weapon within the Phlogiston, it would create a fatally engulfing ball of flame.\nOver-absorption of heat was a fatal for qnidar and caused a biological process wherein their bodies fully crystalized. They took on a different crystalline structure, however, if this death was caused by either their breath in the Phlogiston or being subjected to powerful castings of fireball.\nQnidar typically attacked spelljammers with their breath weapon solely for the purpose of generating heat, often doing so if they were brought out of spelljamming speed by a ship passing by. They always intending to eventually absorb the heat generated by their flames, consequently causing them to be gradually extinguished. However, if their feeding process was interrupted by someone attacking them, a qnidar would \"scream\" at the offending spelljammer, unleashing its breath continually until it ensured that it would no longer be interfered with whilst feeding.\nQnidar traveled in packs, usually moving in single-line formations, allowing them to feed upon the heat trails of their pack leader.\nThese creatures subsisted off of heat and light. Any heat or light they consumed was visible in the form of a sort of vaporous trail, constantly arcing around and through their bodies.\nDespite subsisting off of heat, Qnidar were not always found around heat-based celestial bodies, for too much background heat could confuse their senses and make it difficult to communicate with one another. They could most commonly be found along the spaceways and trade lanes of Wildspace. And they were rarely ever found in the Phlogiston.\nAmong the known crystal spheres, they could be found in both Krynnspace and Realmspace.\nQnidar uniquely communicated amongst themselves via a thermal breath.\nQnidar hides maintained their heat and light absorption properties, thus they served as excellent material components for heat-based and light-based spells and could make an effective source of lighting when heated. A fully crystalized qnidar corpse had the additional property of absorbing magic, making them suitable as minor spelljamming helms if carved out into a proper seat.\nThe different crystalline body structure exhibited by qnidar who died in the Phologiston or from severe fireball assaults were found to be an effective material for crystal balls.\nThese creatures were first discovered and named by the dracons, the name meaning \"heat-eaters\" in their language. Early on there were many disastrous encounters between qnidar and spelljammers, who often mistook them for other members of their species and would attempt to communicate with them. While they eventually recognized that spelljammers were not other qnidar, the creatures came to the realization that \"talking\" to these ships generated a considerable amount of heat that they could consume.\nAround the early 1360s DR, the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company of Toril employed one or more qnidar.Gold & Glory refers to several historical events as \"recent\", including the end of the Horde Wars (1360 DR), the Amnian discovery of Maztica (1361 DR), the settlement of Fort Flame in Maztica (1364 DR), and the ongoing power vacum in Tethyr (1360s DR). It is therefore assumed the sourcebook is set at some point between 1361 and 1364 DR."
