        "mainbody": "'''Fenhounds''' were a type of magical canine native to the [[Domains of Dread]], manifested by the [[Dark Powers]] of that [[demiplane]] from the mystical mists that were prevalent throughout it.",
        "Description": "Fenhounds resembled [[mastiff]]s, having a muscular build and covered in short, coarse brown hair. In addition, an eerie pale yellow light permeated their bodies. They measured roughly {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in length.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures had a level of intellect comparable to that of most mundane [[dog|canines]].",
        "Abilities": "Fenhounds could sense and flawlessly track any creature within their habitat that had committed horribly sinful acts. Their howls sent chills down the spine of any living creature that heard them.\n\nThey could tap into the ambient, supernatural power that accompanied full moons in this demiplane. One effect of this was the aura of light that surrounded them, which gave them an innate magical resistance and made it so that only weapons with a ''[[item enchantment|+2 or greater enchantment]]'' could harm them. This power that they tapped into also made it so that fenhounds were unharmed and unhindered by [[spell]]s from the [[Sun sphere]] or those given to [[priest]]s by gods of the moon, moors, or revenge.\n\nIf slain, a fenhound's body dissipated into a cloud of shimmering vapor that would quickly fade away. However, those who dealt the finishing blow to the fenhound were marked with a [[curse]]. This would lead them to being hunted by a pack of fenhounds every subsequent night of a full moon. Slaying all within a pack would allow the cursed individual to be safe until the next full moon. Only an ''[[atonement]]'' or similar spell could fully release someone from a fenhound's curse.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Fenhound NWN.jpg|thumb|''A fierce fenhound from [[Neverwinter Nights series]].''|300x300px]]\nThese creatures charged straight towards their targets, lunging at them with their powerful jaws. They were relentless in the pursuit of their targets and would not hesitate to attack those who blocked their way or tried to protect their target.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Fenhounds were only encountered in the Domains of Dread during a full moon. They were typically found in the demiplane's dark bogs, moors, and swamps. Whenever brought to the [[Prime Material plane]], a fenhound would remain either until dawn or until their target was slain.",
            "Relationships": "Despite not being creatures of an evil disposition,"
