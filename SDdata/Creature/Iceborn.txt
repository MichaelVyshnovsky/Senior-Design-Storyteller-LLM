An iceborn was a type of clone that was similar to a simulacrum. 
Iceborns were exact clones of an individual, While it was not obvious from their appearance, iceborns were hollow constructs made wholly of living ice. They did not appear to breathe.
If defeated in battle, an iceborn would loudly crack and shatter. They could not be knocked unconscious, and instead would fall to pieces.
Creating an iceborn required the flesh of the individual being cloned.
Similar to clones produced by the clone spell, iceborns were fully sentient and believed themselves to be the person from whom they had been cloned.
An iceborns touch, breath, and even glare were supernaturally cold, and could even injure creatures that were normally resilient against such cold. In turn, an iceborn was highly resistant to the cold, and could absorb and weaponize the cold. They could also confer some resilience against cold to nearby allies. 
Iceborns could fly.
