'''Vine blights''' were a type of [[blight]], a group of evil plant creatures with both movement and some intelligence.

==Description==
Vines blights appeared as masses of vines.

==Behavior==
Alone among the blights, vine blights could speak, and their connection to the spirit of the Gulthias tree that spawned them meant that they spoke in a broken version of the spirit's voice. They were known to taunt victims and bargain with more powerful foes.

Vine blights were known to have an almost [[vampire]]-like desire for fresh blood.

==Abilities==
Vine blights were slow to move, but as long as they remained motionless they were indistinguishable from a mere tangle of vines. They could not see, though they had [[blindsight]]. Vine blights also possessed the ability to call vines and roots to burst out of the ground for {{SI|15|ft}} around them, entangling enemies in the area and hampering their movement.

==Ecology==
Vine blights lived in forests under the influence of the [[Gulthias tree]] that spawned them.

==Notable Vine Blights==
* A particularly bloodthirsty group of vine blights, known as the [[holdfast vines]], dwelt in [[Forestfall Fen]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Peculiarly, they did not appear to have been spawned from a Gulthias tree. The mightiest among the holdfast vines was known as [[Smothertree]].
