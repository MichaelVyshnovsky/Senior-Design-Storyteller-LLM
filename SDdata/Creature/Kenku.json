        "Personality": "[[File:Kenku slice.png|thumb|''An anatomic drawing of kenku's head.''|352x352px]]\nKenku were by habit secretive, self-seeking, and cunning creatures. They tended to adopt [[neutral]] or [[unaligned]] views and behaviors; the majority were [[neutral evil|evil]], but [[true neutral]] and [[neutral good|good]] kenku could be found among them. They were opportunistic and unscrupulous, not stopping at illegal or immoral acts.\n\nAlthough they were selfish, kenku actually operated surprisingly well together and with allies. A kenku was most effective when aided or aiding an ally.",

        "Society": "[[File:Kenku.png|thumb|250px|''A kenku adventurer.'']]\nKenku lived in close-knit gangs, family groups, or clans, commonly called \"flocks\". These flocks were distrusting of outsiders, even of other kenku. They established aeries or nests, usually hidden and often near large cities or at least in civilized lands. Kenku had their own language, but typically spoke [[Common]].\n\nAfter hatching from their eggs, kenku remained in their home-nests with their families. Once they reached adulthood at age nine, they left their nests forever. Unwilling to travel alone, most soon banded together with other young adult kenku of similar habits for mutual protection and profit, forming new flocks. A few made their way on their own or formed partnerships with other creatures who needed their services.\n\nThese kenku gangs made their homes in the cities, where they loitered in dark alleys or roamed the streets together. Thanks to their skills and habits and lack of scruples, they flourished in the criminal underbelly, hatching schemes to get rich and strong. They could operate all kinds of illicit enterprises, but preferred confidence tricks and scheming. Violence was rarely their first choice. They hoarded their stolen, shiny [[gold]].\n\nKenku, in gangs or alone, were usually hired as thieves or thugs, even as assassins and spies.\n\nTypical kenku ruffians were unsophisticated [[warrior]]s who depended on numbers to overwhelm a foe. A true kenku warrior cultivated a martial art in which they flitted here and there, apparently at random, but striking quickly as they did. They also made brutal attacks against those they had the advantage over.\n\nServing as assassins and spies, kenku sneaks were often [[rogue]]s who especially depended on stealth and cooperation, and on acting first. Some could disappear amongst their fellows, before they would resurface and strike again. Some dedicated themselves to the path of [[assassin]].\n\nLeading them on heists and raids, the ringleader of a kenku gang was a capable brawler who could urge his kind to press an attack, to move and scatter, or flee when a fight went against them.\n\nKenku had a [[magic]]al tradition employing air magic and glowing feathers of force to hinder and harm. Unlike other kenku, they could even fly for short time, with their arts. They preferred the safety of height. It was rare to spot a kenku [[cleric]], but the few among them usually follows gods of secrecy.\n\nSome kenku dedicated themselves to the path of [[assassin]]. The kenku assassin combined the warrior's martial art and the wing mage's feathers, together with a poisoned blade.\n\nSome kenku served the [[demon lord]] [[Pazuzu]], patron of evil flying things.",
        "History": {
            "Kenku Lands": "[[File:Companion Kenku NW.png|thumb|''Kenku archers.'']]\nIn the 14th century [[DR]], kenku could be found lurking in cities throughout southern [[Faerûn]]. A large but loosely connected guild of kenku thieves and assassins was based in [[Zazesspur]], [[Tethyr]], and was called the [[Daggertalons]]. Kenku also inhabited Estagund and Veldorn in the [[Shining Lands]] of the southeast.''Monster Manual III'' page 87 and ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' page 96 state that the wingless kenku of eastern Faerûn hailed from [[Kara-Tur]], where the tengu was originally presented and culturally fitting, suggesting that the kenku descended from the tengu. However, it is briefly mentioned in [[Serpent Kingdoms|''Serpent Kingdoms'']] that kenku are creations or descendants of the [[aearee]]. It's unknown how this interacts with the other origins of the kenku.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1479}}, kenku were well-established and populous in the southeast. They were particularly prominent in the cities of the Beastlands, In [[Tirumala]], both kenku slaves and a kenku spy network served the [[rakshasa]] rulers. In neighboring Durpar, they could be found in [[Assur]], [[Vaelan]], and other locales still held by [[human]]s, and made up a significant proportion of the population. Kenku and [[halfling]] gangs fought for control of the streets of Vaelan.\n\nThe kenku even established their own domain in the so-called [[Blackfeather Barrens]], the badlands between the monster-ruled realms of the Beastlands. From their hidden rookery, [[Blackfeather]], it was rumored they commanded a secret organization of kenku loyal solely to their own kind, not to the array of different causes kenku served in the surrounding cities. More obviously, those of Blackfeather attacked all trespassers without mercy, making it a place to be feared by all."
