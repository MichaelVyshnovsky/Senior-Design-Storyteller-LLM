        "mainbody": "'''Athasian halflings''' were a race of [[halfling]]s endemic to the desert world of [[Athas]].{{Cite dragon/319/Dark Sun: Player's Handbook|25}}",
        "Description": "The average Athasian halfling adult stood {{SIrange|3'0.5\"|4'0\"|ft-in}} tall and weighed around {{SIrange|50|60|lb}}. Their muscles were comparable to that of adult humans, but their facial features were youthful. Due to their lifestyle, an Athasian halfling's body was usually in peak physical condition and their skin, which varied in tone, tended to be well bronzed. Beyond their heads, these halflings had largely hairless bodies.\n\nIt was common for Athasian halflings to decorate their bodies with piercings, [[tattoo]]s, and war-paint. Both men and women tended to wear their hair as long, unkempt manes, though priests typically shaved their heads.",
        "Personality": "These halflings were widely known by other Athasian races as being brave, cunning, Thus the more widely traveled a halfling was, the more likely they were to be tolerant of other cultures, showing great openness in trying new experiences and forms of food or entertainment.\n\nSome tribes, known as \"renegades\", were more brutal and xenophobic in their behavior than others, caring only for themselves and their own tribe. Whilst other tribes were open to trading with outsiders that showed them respect, though retained a sense of wariness towards them.\n\nThese halflings did not have any [[alignment]] preference, though those that lived among the city-states or were \"renegades\" tended to lean towards [[chaotic neutral]].\n\nAthasian halflings were also a deeply spiritual people. They showed great reverence towards nature and [[primal spirit]]s, their reverence rivaling other races on Athas. They showed great care towards the inner well-being of individual people, though some would argue otherwise, and pitied those who lived in the deserts for how they had to struggle for food and water, though this could at times come across as patronizing.",
        "Abilities": "Like many creatures on Athas, a good deal of Athasian halflings possessed the power of [[psionics]].",
        "Combat": "When hunting Athasian halflings preferred a stealthy approach, stalking their prey and waiting for the right opportunity to ambush them. Other common tactics included the use of booby traps and [[poison]]ed weapons, particularly poisoned [[dart]]s. Other weapons preferred by halflings included [[dagger]]s, [[bow]]s, [[halfspear]]s, and like halflings on other worlds they had talent with [[sling]]s. Any weaponry they had was typically made of bones or wood, as metal was scarce on Athas.\n\nWhen hunting, halflings often made an effort to capture their prey alive so that it could be brought back to their village and presented to their tribal chiefs.\n\nDue to their deep reverence for nature, it was not uncommon for Athasian halflings to take up the path of a [[druid]]{{Cite dragon/319/Dark Sun: Player's Handbook|21}} or [[shaman]] and [[w:c:darksun:cleric|elemental clerics]].",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Halflings were an omnivorous species, though they leaned towards a preference for meat over vegetation.\n\nThey considered all non-halfling creatures to be potential sources food, including intelligent and sentient species. The most savage of the tribes wouldn't hesitate to eat their prisoners alive, while the more civilized tribes always killed and cooked their prey before consuming it and might even give it a chance to explain why it shouldn't be eaten.",
            "Homelands": "The halflings of Athas were largely settled within the few remaining forests and jungles of the desert world, such as the [[w:c:darksun:Forest Ridge|Forest Ridge]],",
            "Languages": "Athasian halflings spoke their own language, known simply as \"halfling\", which was based upon the sounds made by various forest creatures. It consisted of a collection of chirps, hoots, howls, shrieks, and whistles. They also relied heavily upon their shared culture for communicating with one another. Many halflings also spoke the [[Athasian trade tongue]], picking it up from traveling merchants and other envoys.",
            "Relationships": "The halflings of Athas were the least social of all halfling subraces in the [[multiverse]] and were widely feared by other races on their desert world. Those who lived outside their forest homes typically lived as raiders, mercenaries, hunters, trackers, guides, slavers, or [[slavery|slaves]]. Whenever they were enslaved it was typically as a gladiator curiosity, since it was well-known that Athasian halflings generally didn't last long in bondage. Those living in city-states sometimes they worked for nobility as hunting guides, craftsmen, or stonechippers in return for merely room and board.\n\nThey cautiously engaged in trading arrangements with nearby cultures, regardless of their race. However, they would not allow traders into their village, instead conducting any trade within a neutral location or within the other party's community.\n\nAthasian halflings often tamed wild beasts within the Forest Ridge, such as [[kirre]]s and [[panther]]s."
        },
        "History": "Halflings were notably the first sentient race on Athas. After the destruction of their early civilization, the halflings of Athas evolved into that world's [[Athasian dwarf|dwarves]], [[w:c:darksun:gnome|gnomes]], [[w:c:darksun:human|human]]s, and other [[demihuman]] and [[humanoid]] races of Athas. They also possibly evolved into that world's [[Athasian elf|elves]], though others believed that Athasian elves were descended from [[high elves]] that had settled on Athas in eons past. Information on this ancient time would be passed down over the ages through a strong oral tradition recounts, but would deteriorate to the point they felt like mere fables and legends.\n\nAt some point a powerful, planeshifting fortress known as [[Planar Sphere|The Planar Sphere]] visited Athas and abducted a group of Athasian halflings that included the [[mage]] [[Taibela]] and the [[necromancer]] [[Necre]]. The halflings remained trapped in the Planar Sphere after it departed from Athas, occupying its furnace room until [[Gorion's Ward]] entered the fortress in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, after it manifested on [[Toril]] in the [[Amnian]] city of [[Athkatla]]'s slums.\n\nSome time else in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], in The Year of Despair on the Malatran calendar, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[gate]]'' to the faraway world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by elven slavers.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|9}} Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.\n\nAfter two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large [[erdlu]] [[egg]]s (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two ''[[potion fruit|apples of healing]]''. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach the [[Ringing Forest]], which held a way for them to return to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|13-14}}\n\nWhen the Malatran adventurers eventually reached their destination, a massive [[oak]] tree in the Ringing Forest, they encountered a group of thirty Athasian halflings that they mistook for the similarly tattooed and halfling-like [[shu]] of Malatra. A pair of them emerged from the underbrush, introducing themselves to a shu in the party as [[Botila]] and [[Trenik]]. Mistaking the shu for an Athasian halfling, they thank them for bringing their tribe a feast (referring to the other Malatran adventurers) and asks the party to put down their arms. A fight quickly ensues,{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|21-22}} though the shu are reluctant to hurt the halflings. The adventurers get knocked out by the [[sleep poison]] laced on the halfling weaponry, but touch the oak in the process, allowing the [[earth elemental noble]] [[Roshink]] to transport them back to the Malatran Plateau, where they later awaken on the banks of the [[River of Laughing Idols]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|23}}"
