        "Description": "Seemingly patchwork in bodily structure, a leucrotta's form was composed of the parts of a wide variety of animals. Their heads were low-slung, wedge shaped and similar in appearance to that of a giant [[badger]]. Their body was {{SI|9|ft}} long and seemed to be a cross between a [[stag]] and a [[hyena]]. Deer-like legs ending in cloven hooves were far more concrete in their resemblance, but nonetheless made it impossible to distinguish between the tracks of a leucrotta and a stag.{{Cite dragon/91/The Ecology of the Leucrotta|16-17}} The laughter of a leucrotta was made distinctive, as it was a cross between hyena and [[human]].<ref name= \"EE.TGGLoT-p14-15\" />\n\nThe patchwork features of leucrottas did not make their hideous appearance inevitable. In fact, a leucrotta could be a handsome, and even a humorous looking beast if those were its only traits. Instead, the horrible appearance of the leucrottas was a result of their more off-putting characteristics, such as their glowing red eyes, constant drooling, and jagged bony ridges in place of teeth. Other eerie features were their oily, putrid, skin that was colored a motley of black, gray, and brown. The notably noxious stench that hung off their bodies was topped only by their awful breath, corrupted by a combination of digestive fluid and carrion. A pink [[dog]]-like tongue further contributed to their hodgepodge physical structure. Their generally ghoulish appearance was furthered by their skeletal form and lack of close-cropped fur. \n\nThere also existed a legendary [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] species of leucrottas that were three times the size of their [[Material Plane]] counterparts, reaching {{SI|30|ft}} in length.{{Cite dragon/345/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Kostchtchie: Prince of Wrath|29-30}}",

        "Combat": "Stalking came easily to leucrottas, as their strong sense of smell and difficult to distinguish tracks made them both excellent in pursuit and stealth. They often attempted to make the task easier by viciously savaging prey before stalking them as they bled out. Leucrottas went on the prowl under the cover of night or masking terrain before rushing out at prey and tearing away at them with their jagged jaws. Despite their massive size they could move as fast as a normal-sized warhorse. Rather than finish off victims one at a time they disabled one opponent before lashing out at the next. The jaws of a leucrotta had steel plates as strong as [[adamantine]] in place of teeth, capable of ripping the armor and flesh of a well equipped knight.\n\nTheir equine hooves were also dangerous, able to bring down their full weight upon fallen victims or kicking opponents from the rear before making sudden retreats. They were known to carry a mild resistance to poison and diseases. While the foul stench of a leucrotta would normally give it away, leucrotta possessed the ability to mimic the noises of humans and animals. All imitations were done with an equal amount of skill by adult leucrottas and the only way to improve this ability was to learn more about their targets to craft more convincing illusions. So innate was the evil of a leucrotta that many were reported to be immune to the effects of charm and compulsion magic.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Homelands": "Leucrotta could be found anywhere too desolate for humanoids to come after them but still not too remote from places to hunt. They could be found throughout the [[the North]]{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}} the [[Dagger Hills]] in the [[Dalelands]], the [[Lonely Moor]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], the mountains of [[Turmish]],<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/96/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Mysterious Turmish|5}} and the coast of the [[Vilhon Reach]] in [[Chondath]]. Within the [[Domains of Dread]], some could be found in [[Hazlik]]'s domain of [[Hazlan]].",
            "Religion": "It was often debated by sages whether or not leucrottas were intelligent or just cunning and talented, a mystery caused by the fact that very few intelligent species could stomach the thought of keeping any alive. The truth was that they were intelligent and even had their own \"pantheon\" of gods and goddesses, known as [[The Pack (fiends)|The Pack]] whom they worshiped fervently. The pack was led by the greatest and possibly first leucrotta, [[Toknana]]."

        "Biology": {
            "Subspecies": "Ranging from subtropical to subarctic, leucrottas could habituate many diverse biomes. Those residing in arctic regions had a thick layer of fat to shield them from the cold that blunted conventional weaponry. Most dwelt in hilly or mountainous places using their hooves to easily maneuver throughout rocky cliffs and ravines.\n\nDeep within the depths of the [[Abyss]] were legendary leucrottas that resided in the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 23: Iron Wastes|Iron Wastes]], far more powerful than their worldly counterparts. They were huge monsters with regenerative abilities an and immunity to frost, but a vulnerability to heavy heat.\n\nThere  existed a type of leucrotta tainted with [[doppelganger]] blood known as a changesteed, that had a stronger craving for humanoid flesh and would transform into a rider's mount and take their place before attacking them when they were alone."
        },
        "History": "During [[Yeenoghu]]'s first ancient incursion of the Material Plane, the hyenas who consumed his kills went through aberrant transformations, creating an assortment of bizarre and fiendish monstrosities. While most of these were gnolls, the second most common result was the leucrotta. Leucrotta foremost served the interests of the Ruler of Ruin when requested, but were keen to torment random beings if left unchecked.\n\nSince then the leucrottas had worked under other demonic powers, such as [[Kostchtchie]], Prince of Wrath. The demon lord saw a bit of his own mindset in their behavior and treated them like how a king treated his mastiffs, as hunting dogs and bodyguards that helped him in his demon hunts and that he fed his victims, whose armor crunched like [[paper]] under their fangs. Those of sufficient power in Kostchtchie's faith could call upon these pets whom he dubbed his hounds.\n\nLeucrotta could be found on [[Toril]] as far back as the [[-23040 DR|-23000's DR]]. During this time several small leucrotta kingdoms existed in the [[Shining Lands]], which eventually destroyed each other due a number of bitter feuds.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-12-29 - The Shining Lands in -23,040 DR}}\n\nBetween [[1368 DR]] and [[1372 DR]] an unprecedented numbers of leucrottas had been seen around the [[Silver Marches]], In response to this, bounties were paid for leucrotta ears in [[Silverymoon]] and [[Everlund]]. Leucrottas were so renown for their malice in this region that the locals had turned its name into a swear word that meant; a good plan turned into a bad idea by terrible luck.\n\nTheir loathsome behavior kept them isolated in barren lands, but a large number could be found in [[Skullport]] where their changesteed variants worked as allies of the [[Unseen]]."
