        "mainbody": "'''The Viciscamera''' was a creature-like monstrosity developed by [[Saablic Tan]] of the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. It was referred to as a \"machine\" or \"device\", and had the power to turn [[drow]] into savage, barely sane [[drider]]s.",
        "Description": "The Viciscamera consisted of a giant \"heart\" and several pods. Within the pods, the drow-to-drider transformation would happen, but it was powered by the heart.\n\nThe heart was a malodorous mass of gray-white flesh with a large open mouth with several sharp teeth, which throbbed and pulsed. Each time the Viciscamera convulsed, a foul-smelling odor appeared from its maw. The pods, which looked like silken and damp cocoons, were attached to the heart by fleshy tubes. After the transformation was complete, the pods would burst open, and leak out tubes of flesh.\n\nThe heart had a self-defense mechanism, which was to spew out [[acid fog]] when attacked. The driders in the attached pods would also awaken and attack. The device had a strong natural defense due to its hard, ensorcelled hide.\n\nA possible weakness of the seemingly invincible device was an enchanted poison to turn the many defenses of the heart against itself. It would seem that only using special giant fungi spores and a silvery fluid with the appearance of liquid webbing could form such a concoction.",

            "Development": "[[File:Pod.png|thumb|right|''A Viciscamera pod, where the transformation of drow to drider took place.'']]\nImphraili continued to study the Viciscamera, and made several modifications. The modifications to the pods would affect the nature of the drider produced from the drow host. Some of the experimental lifeforms were:\n* ''Celeridrider'': a twitching male drider that replicated a [[quickling]]'s pace and metabolism.\n* ''Spithdrider'': a male drider that had the unique ability to cast webs from every leg. This drider wasn't as strong as others, and had a lighter exoskeleton.\n* ''Cradoldrider'': a bloated female drider that carried spiders in her abdomen. This drider was incredibly slow and couldn't spin webs."
