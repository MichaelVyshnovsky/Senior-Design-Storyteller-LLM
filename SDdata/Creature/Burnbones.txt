'''Burnbones''' were high level members of the [[Church of Cyric]] whose mortal frames had been dissolved and transformed from being infused with a portion of his divine power.

==Description==
Burnbones had a similar appearance to the [[blazing bones]] that were commonly found in [[Myth Drannor]]. They typically were seen wearing the symbol of [[Cyric]].

==Personality==
Burnbones existed only to serve the greater glory of the Prince of Lies, bending to his every whim, suffering insufferable pain and anguish if they ever thought of doing otherwise.

==Abilities==
Burnbones could call upon all the [[cleric]]al powers they commanded in life at a greater extent of efficiency.
