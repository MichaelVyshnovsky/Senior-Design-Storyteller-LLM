        "mainbody": "Some believed fensir were completely unrelated to [[troll]]s, but rather more related to [[giant]]s. In truth they were descended from trolls brought to Ysgard by frost giants on an attempted campaign of conquest. The planes resurrection energies mixed with the innate regenerative nature of trolls caused those early trolls to slowly change into the first fensir.",
        "Description": "Unlike trolls on the Material Plane, members of their race varied widely in both their height and appearance. whilst some were nearly [[human]]-like in their appearance.\n\nSome fensir would undergo a transformation after living for at least a thousand years in Ysgard, which translated as \"Devourer\". This transformation was hideous, with the fensir reaching heights of {{SIrange|20|25|ft|long=yes}} and potentially gaining around {{SI|6000|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight. According to other sources, this transformation was exclusive to female fensir and occurred sometime after they first gave birth.\n\nAlso unlike prime trolls, the fensir did not dress in furs, but rather the civilized clothing common in Ysgard. Both sexes typically dressed in fine [[leather armor]] and vests, with big black hats made from [[rabbit]] fur in varying styles. Men in particular also favored [[helmet]]s, leather [[boot]]s, [[wool]]en [[hosiere|hose]], and woolen [[tunic]]s. While women fensir favored simple woven dresses, leather shoes, and [[linen]] or woolen scarves.",
        "Personality": "Another way that fensir were nothing like trolls on the Prime Material was their mentality. They were far more intelligent and cultured, though this intelligence dimmed after becoming a rakka and was overtaken by a ravenous hunger.\n\nFensir had a tendency to be shy, And they were a rather secretive people who tended to keep to themselves, rarely interfering in the lives of others, the sole exception to this being a near-obsessive fascination they had with [[lillendi]]. In turn, they expected others to respect their privacy.\n\nFensir twins tended to have similar personalities and an almost psychic connection between them. If one was killed, the other would stop at nothing to avenge their death. Fighting in a frenzied state and even finding a way to the Material Plane if necessary.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Magic": "Almost all fensir had the ability to cast spells and were potent [[diviner]]s, able to brew almost any kind of magic [[potion]]. Males especially tended to be adept in [[magic]], with around 75% of male fensir being [[mage]]s. The magic practiced by fensir was often either the [[rune magic]] of Ysgard or [[elemental magic]] of [[earth]] and stone. Whenever fensir transformed into a rakka, they lost their ability to cast spells.\n\nThe [[arcane spell]]s that the average fensir knew how to cast included the following:\n: ''[[bull's strength]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[create or destroy water]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[ghost sound]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[obscuring mist]]'', ''[[pass without trace]]'', ''[[protection from law]]'', ''[[ray of frost]]'', and ''[[read magic]]''."
        },
        "Combat": "When it came to weaponry, the fensir shared the proclivities of Ysgardian [[petitioner]]s. Favoring [[battle axe]]s, [[broadsword]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[greataxe]]s. However, because of their shy nature, the average fensir preferred to remain at a distance instead of engaging in close quarters. Additionally, in a battle fensir would focus their attention upon any opponent they knew was able of casting ''sunbeam'', ''sunburst'', or some equivalent.\n\nWhen caught unarmed, which was often the case with foraging youth and always the case with a rakka, fensirs would cast spells or use their impressive strength to hurl boulders at their foes. Like many giants, they were quite proficient when it came to hurling boulders and usually had a few on hand. And fensir who were excellent herbalists, but unable to cast spells, would rely upon magic potions.",
        "Society": {
            "Gender Roles": "When it came to men and women among the fensir, the two rarely spent time together. This was to such an extent that some outsiders would claim they lived seperate lives, but the fensir did not think their way of life as being unusual.\n\nIn terms of roles, male fensir were the spiritual leaders and lawgivers of their household. They tended to specialize in the craft of [[herbalism]], being quite excellent at it, and a great degree of the magic known by their mages was tied to herbalism, allowing them to make both potions and poultices. They were also fair craftsmen, poor at hunting, and excellent at hunting. Preparing and blessing the foraged food brought to them. \n\nWomen among the fensir acted as the heads of households. Being the keepers of family treasure, the primary protectors, and the providers. They foraged for food alongside their young. They also provided for their families by specializing in being both brewmasters and weavers. \n\nWhenever the rakka of a fensir family died, its household would be seized by what their people called the \"Long Walk,\" an instinctual sense of wanderlust. They would leave their homes, never to return to them, roaming the wild wastes of Ysgard. Foraging and pillaging the land out of anger, confusion, or spite. Sometimes these families would gather with other into a horde and travel beyond the confines of Ysgard's wastes, pillaging the Ysgardian realms of [[Alfheim]], [[Asgard]], [[Vanaheim]], and the [[Gates of the Moon]].",
            "Languages": "On average a fensir could speak [[Common]], [[Giant language|Giant]], any number of the languages found throughout Ysgard, and the language of lillendi.",
            "Relationships": "Fensir were on tolerable terms with the [[elves]] and [[Ysgardian dwarf|dwarves]] of Ysgard, female fensir especially. Trading them the clothes they weaved in return for metal goods such as [[arrow|arrowheads]], [[cleaver]]s, spears, [[stewpot]]s, and tea kettles. Beyond the dwarves, female fensir sold the [[beer]] and [[mead]] they brewed to other fensir, giants, and Ysgardian petitioners.\n\n[[Human]]s were sometimes sought after by solitary fensir as a mate. The [[bariaur]]s that inhabited Ysgard considered the fensir to be wise elders, often consulting them on matters of herbalism as well as diagnosis and treatment of conditions. Finally, fensir were known to kidnap and enslave lillendi, though they usually managed to avoid the fensir quite easily."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Lifespan": "After the transformation into a rakka, the expected lifespan of a fensir often declined significantly. Living only one to a few years after the transformation.",
            "Reproduction": "Fensir women typically gave birth to litters of two to eight young. The majority of such births were of fraternal twins, though it wasn't uncommon for a litter to have as little as one set and having no twins was a possibility. By the time a fensir mother dies they will likely have given birth to a second or even third litter.",
            "Diet": "The fensir were an omnivorous people, dining upon anything that was even remotely edible. Besides scavenged meat, fensir were known to eat bark, [[grass]]es, roots, and even some forms of [[clay]]. Gathered nuts and roots made up the bolk of a fensir diet. Meat broth was considered by them to be a delicacy, with the flesh of [[halfling]]s being especially prized.",
            "Homelands": "Fensir lived on the plane of Ysgard,<ref> on its fringes,\n\nFensir made their homes in such areas as deserted heaths, deep woods, rocky sea-cliffs, high mountains, and secluded swamps. These homes were always sunken into the earth, for the sake of providing warmth during the winter, and usually roofed with sod so that they were difficult for others to find. As a family's rakka grew in size they inevitably needed to create a larger home, becoming equivalent to a small village. Families often stripped the countryside surrounding their homes bare as they tried to appease and sustain their mother. And due to the Long Walk, it was quite common throughout Ysgard to stumble upon an abandoned fensir lair."
