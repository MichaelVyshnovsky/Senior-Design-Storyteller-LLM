Gduar was an aberration in the Upperdark, resembling a treant made of fungi. It mostly kept to itself, tending to its fungal garden. Amongst its possessions, it held the Third Imaskarcana.
Gduar was a translucent mass, covered in mold.
Though similar to a treant, Gduar had a number of abilities that set it apart from plants. It had a corrosive breath weapon, the ability to engulf enemies, and a paralyzing digestive acid which acted on anyone it struck or engulfed. Since its shape was less defined, it could not be flanked. It could animate fungi instead of trees.
