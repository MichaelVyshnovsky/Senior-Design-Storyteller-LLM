        "mainbody": "A '''Lolth-touched''' was a creature specially blessed by the [[goddess]] [[Lolth]]. Any creature was capable of receiving this blessing, though they were typically ones native to underground habitats.",
        "Description": "Creatures that were Lolth-touched became bulkier, with bipedal ones becoming even taller. Their coloration also became darker, allowing them to more easily fade into the shadows. And they sometimes sported a faint emblem of a spider on their body, marking their favored status.",
        "Behavior": "Lolth-touched creatures were known to be utterly fearless and always had a [[chaotic evil]] [[alignment]].",
        "History": "In the city of [[Menzoberranzan]], Lolth-touched creatures protected the training academies on [[Tier Breche]]. And Lolth-touched bodyguards attended high nobles whenever they ventured away from their estates.",
        "Society": {
            "Habitats": "Regardless of what type of habitat they once preferred, any creature that was Lolth-touched was usually found underground. Those that served Lolth directly lived within her [[divine realm]], the [[Demonweb Pits]], though sometimes they were sent on specific missions.",
            "Relationships": "Lolth-touched [[mount]]s and beasts of burden, usually [[vermin]], abounded in [[drow]] societies. These were mainly used by the nobility and [[priest]]ly classes. They could be found accompanying Lolth priestesses and guarding her temples. They could also be found serving as war beasts within drow armies. \n\nLolth-touched creatures often rose to positions of leadership among drow, commanding elite squads that patrol the underground territory around drow cities. [[Drow judicator]]s were often blessed as Lolth-touched, which strengthened their [[spider]]-form's venom, and those that were particularly blessed could even be found with a Lolth-touched servant."
