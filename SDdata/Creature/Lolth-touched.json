        "mainbody": "Lolth-touched was a creature specially blessed by the goddess Lolth. Any creature was capable of receiving this blessing, though they were typically ones native to underground habitats.\nCreatures that were Lolth-touched became bulkier, with bipedal ones becoming even taller. Their coloration also became darker, allowing them to more easily fade into the shadows. And they sometimes sported a faint emblem of a spider on their body, marking their favored status.\nLolth-touched creatures were known to be utterly fearless and always had a chaotic evil alignment.\nIn the city of Menzoberranzan, Lolth-touched creatures protected the training academies on Tier Breche. And Lolth-touched bodyguards attended high nobles whenever they ventured away from their estates. \nRegardless of what type of habitat they once preferred, any creature that was Lolth-touched was usually found underground. Those that served Lolth directly lived within her divine realm, the Demonweb Pits, though sometimes they were sent on specific missions.\nLolth-touched mounts and beasts of burden, usually vermin, abounded in drow societies. These were mainly used by the nobility and priestly classes. They could be found accompanying Lolth priestesses and guarding her temples. They could also be found serving as war beasts within drow armies. \nLolth-touched creatures often rose to positions of leadership among drow, commanding elite squads that patrol the underground territory around drow cities. Drow judicators were often blessed as Lolth-touched, which strengthened their spider-forms venom, and those that were particularly blessed could even be found with a Lolth-touched servant.\n* Rhylfang\n* Susurrus"
