For the most part, a vampire retained the appearance they had in life. The main differences were their pale skin tone and sharp, feral features, giving them a predatory aspect. Whatever their eye color was in life, after transformation, vampires eyes changed to a red color that was hard to forget. Their hands ended in sharp, glassy claws.
They did not cast shadows, had no reflections in mirrors, and moved in complete silence.
Vampires enjoyed finer things in unlife and engaged in decadent behavior, often sharing such habits with liches. A vampire was always a creature of evil. If they were not evil in life, they became so in undeath, whether they retained the memories of their mortal existence or not. Whatever attachments and affection they had towards things from their life, all were changed and corrupted by the transformation. Love was flipped to obsession, and the feelings of friendship were made into feelings of jealousy. Many vampires became obsessed and fixated on things they desired in the past – those who once sought love became predators searching for beauty in their victims, and those who valued youth could fixate on children, snuffing out the future potential of mortals at the very beginning of their journeys. These obsessions extended to possessions, as many vampires delved into collecting art, acquiring terrifying implements of torture, or decorating their lairs with trophies.
Being highly intelligent and ageless creatures, vampires forged their plans meticulously and advanced the schemes slowly, sometimes taking decades to take steps toward their goals. Vampires felt no need to rush as they could outlive their mortal enemies and spend decades or centuries planning revenge.
A vampire retained all the abilities they had in life but also gained the ability to drain blood and life energy and the ability to dominate other creatures with their gaze. They could also command vermin creatures such as rats, bats, and wolves or take the form of those creatures. Vampires could also transform their bodies into a gaseous form at will, and they transformed into the same state upon the death of their physical bodies, allowing the vampire to slink away into their coffin and recover. They could walk on all surfaces as if under the effects of the spider climb spell.
Like all undead, vampires existed on two planes at the same time – the Prime Material plane and the Negative Energy plane. Being undead, they were also immune to the effects of the sleep, charm, and hold spells. Vampires were extremely resistant to non-magical damage of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing variety, and were unaffected or barely harmed by necrotic magics, were resistant to cold and lightning, and completely unaffected by psionics and paralysis. In addition to resistances, they possessed a powerful ability to regenerate, unless the damage dealt was done via holy water or radiant magic.
Vampires possessed unnaturally acute sensory organs. Their eyes possessed darkvision, their hearing was impeccable, and the sense of smell was beyond that of a mortal.

Like other undead beings, vampires were not a part of a natural world, only existing to spread evil. They did not need to eat mortal food, did not need to breathe, and did not need to sleep apart from when confined to their coffins, resting themselves. When feeding, vampires often attacked swiftly, feeding on unsuspecting victims but leaving them alive. When hunting to kill, vampires made sure to destroy their preys bodies to stop them from rising as undead. Their evil was so strong it was detectable by sensitive creatures like dogs.
A new vampire was created when another vampire drained the life out of a living creature. A humanoid, a monstrous humanoid, a giant, or even a dragon, among others, could become a vampire. This was different for lesser creatures for example, when a vampire drained a flying snake, it had a chance of being raised as a deathfang. Only those drained victims who were buried actually transformed into the undead.
Rarely encountered creatures, known as half-vampires, could be created in one of two ways. First, in some rare cases, a vampire could consume enough blood that it could breed with a humanoid or monstrous humanoid, creating half-vampire offspring. Second, in even rarer cases, if a pregnant mother survived having her blood drained by a vampire, her unborn could be "tainted" with vampirism instead.
On at least one occasion, a dying hill giant shaman of the Kryptgarden Forest was granted vampirism by Grolantor, to whom Morg, the wounded giant, addressed pleas for strength.
Vampires could also be created by enchanted items, such as the Bloodvein – a cursed evil vampiric sword that fed on the blood of creatures it wounded. If the weapons wielder died, Bloodvein brought them back to life at a permanent cost of their constitution. If the last of the wielders constitution was drained with a resurrection, the sword brought them back as a vampire, bound to the sword and its hunger until the vampire was permanently destroyed.
Vampire dust, left after the creature was slain, was a valuable spell component. A pinch of vampire dust was a material component needed to cast the gaseous form spell, the skulltrap spell, protection from all undead, 5 radius, death shroud, as well as the energy drain spell. A droplet of vampire blood was also used in spellcasting as a material component of the Ensuls soultheft. Vampire ichor, in turn, was used as the material component for the casting of the deathbolt spell, while a bit of vampires bone can be used to cast the undead summoning IV, undead summoning V, undead summoning VI, and undead summoning VII spells.
Vampire dust was used in a similar manner in alchemy. It was an ingredient in brewing potions of gaseous form and potions of human control.
Vampire blood, in a certain complaint of other monster fluids, such as trolls, could be magically transferred into a humanoid to grant them regenerative abilities. One such individual changed by necromantic rituals performed by a Zhentish wizard named Dysklai was Kavan Brenzan of Ravens Bluff.
Apart from spells, vampire blood was sought after for being a part of the dracolich transformation. In a similar fashion, those humanoids who wished to achieve lichdom had to gather a quart of vampires blood or blood of a person infected with vampirism. This blood was one of many ingredients that went into the preparation of the special potion used to prepare the body for transformation.
