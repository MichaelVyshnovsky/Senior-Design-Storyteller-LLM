        "mainbody": "Carp hengeyokai () or simply carps were a carp-based subrace of the hengeyokai, a race of intelligent natural shapechanging animals able to adopt carp, human, and hybrid forms. They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.\nIn human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form. Carps might have short statures, large eyes, and pale skin.\nCompared to humans and the average hengeyokai, carps were slightly wiser but less strong, or they were more agile. They were adept in endurance skills.\nIn their animal form, carps were of course excellent swimmers, but they could not swim like fish in their bipedal forms. However, they were significantly slower walking on land than humans.\nOn the whole, carps were good-hearted.\nThey were known to hibernate in the winter.\nCarps, along with cranes, dogs, hares, and monkeys, were more likely to become monks than other hengeyokai.\nThe \"lake folk\" of Nam Tso in Tabot in the midâ€“14 century DR were a school of kindly carps. As theyd rescued some fishermen and a little girl from the lake, theyd earned the respect and aid of the local people in Bidnop So by 1357 DR. Here, they traded rice and opals from the lake bed for things they couldnt manufacture.\n* Moo Kalai, representative of the Nam Tso lake folk"
