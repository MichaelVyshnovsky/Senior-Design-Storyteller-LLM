They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}}",
        "Description": "In human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form. Carps might have short statures, large eyes, and pale skin.",
        "Abilities": "Compared to humans and the average hengeyokai, carps were slightly wiser but less strong, or they were more agile. They were adept in endurance skills.\n\nIn their animal form, carps were of course excellent swimmers, but they could not swim like fish in their bipedal forms.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|7,8}} However, they were significantly slower walking on land than [[human]]s.",
        "Personality": "On the whole, carps were good-hearted.",
        "Society": "They were known to hibernate in the winter.\n\nCarps, along with [[crane hengeyokai|cranes]], [[dog hengeyokai|dogs]], [[hare hengeyokai|hares]], and [[monkey hengeyokai|monkeys]], were more likely to become [[monk]]s than other hengeyokai.",
        "Known Communities": "The \"lake folk\" of [[Nam Tso]] in [[Tabot]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]] were a school of kindly carps.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|3}} As they'd rescued some fishermen and a little girl from the lake, they'd earned the respect and aid of the local people in [[Bidnop So]] by [[1357 DR]]. Here, they traded [[rice]] and [[opal]]s from the lake bed for things they couldn't manufacture.",
