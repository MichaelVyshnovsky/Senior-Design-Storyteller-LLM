Revived fossils were the remains of animals, or more rarely people
Revived fossils were creatures made of petrified bones. While animated, they remained partially encased in stone.
While mostly identical to simple skeletons, revived fossils enjoyed stony bones that shrugged off all but the strongest blows from weapons not made out of adamantine, and their heft granted them additional staying power in a fight.
They required special rituals in order to animate.
Revived fossils could only do as commanded by their masters. The orders could not be too complex, either.
The Underdungeon under Stardeep was unexplored, but some of its passages contained a number of fossilized remains that were animated by the relic lich. The same lich also proved capable of reducing living creatures to a fossilized state.Albeit they are not referred to as revived fossils in the novel, the creatures are referred to as encased in stone, suggesting fossilization. They display similar strengths to a revived fossil, being resistant to most blows, and both Libris Mortis and Stardeep share Bruce R. Cordell as author. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the creatures in Stardeeps Underdungeon are intended to be revived fossils.
The Keeper of the Cerulean Sign Telarian was attacked by a swarm of them once while he was still an Empyrean Knight exploring the Underdungeon, and Commander Brathtar was the one who saved his life then. Another Keeper, Kiril Duskmourn, was attacked alongside her party by the fossils on . At the same time, Telarian encountered the relic lich responsible for the animation of the revived fossils.
