'''Revived fossils''' were the remains of animals, or more rarely people{{cite book/Libris Mortis|118-119}}

==Description==
Revived fossils were creatures made of petrified bones. While animated, they remained partially encased in stone.

==Abilities==
While mostly identical to simple [[skeleton]]s, revived fossils enjoyed stony bones that shrugged off all but the strongest blows from weapons not made out of [[adamantine]], and their heft granted them additional staying power in a fight.
They required special rituals in order to animate.

==Behavior==
Revived fossils could only do as commanded by their masters. The orders could not be too complex, either.

==History==
The Underdungeon under [[Stardeep]] was unexplored, but some of its passages contained a number of fossilized remains that were animated by the [[relic lich]]. The same lich also proved capable of reducing living creatures to a fossilized state.{{cite book/Stardeep|237-239|21}}Albeit they are not referred to as revived fossils in the novel, the creatures are referred to as encased in stone, suggesting fossilization. They display similar strengths to a revived fossil, being resistant to most blows, and both Libris Mortis and Stardeep share Bruce R. Cordell as author. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the creatures in Stardeep's Underdungeon are intended to be revived fossils.

The [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] [[Telarian]] was attacked by a swarm of them once while he was still an [[Empyrean Knight]] exploring the [[Stardeep/Underdungeon|Underdungeon]], and Commander [[Brathtar]] was the one who saved his life then.{{cite book/Stardeep|94|9}} Another Keeper, [[Kiril Duskmourn]], was attacked alongside her party by the fossils on {{yearlink|1375}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|250-251|23}} At the same time, Telarian encountered the relic lich responsible for the animation of the revived fossils.
