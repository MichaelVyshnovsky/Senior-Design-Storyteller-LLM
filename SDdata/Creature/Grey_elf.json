        "mainbody": "'''Grey elves''' were a sub-race of [[high elves]] endemic to the planet of [[Oerth]] and [[Greyspace]].",
        "Description": "Grey elves bore a resemblance to the [[silver elves]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. Standing nearly as tall as [[human]]s,\n\nAll members of this race tended to favor bright garments of gold, silver, yellow, or white. Especially wool [[tunic]]s in those colors. In terms of [[cloak]]s, they most often wore ones that were deep shades of blue or purple.",
        "Personality": "Grey elves had attitudes and outlook comparable to those of most silvanesti on [[Krynn]] and [[sun elves]] on [[Toril]]&mdash;very arrogant and believing themselves to be superior to other races, even [[elf|elven]] races. They considered themselves to be the purest form of elf, despite the fact they were a sub-race. Though of course, not all grey elves possessed a snobbish demeanor.\n\nThese elves also tended to be highly intelligent, and such a quality was very valued in their society. They preferred to rely more on their mental talents than on their physical abilities.",
        "Combat": "Grey elves generally wore winged [[helmet]]s with shimmering suits of [[plate mail]] or [[chainmail]] while carrying [[shield]]s, particularly [[elven chainmail]].<ref> They typically fought with [[bow]]s, [[spear]]s, [[sword]]s, and [[two-handed sword]]s.\n\nHowever, they did not value physical prowess. Thus, many grey elves took up of the profession of a [[mage]], though they usually did not become specialized [[wizard]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, grey elves were occasionally encountered by travelers in the forests of the [[Savage Frontier]].",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "On their home planet of Oerth, they were known to inhabit isolated meadowlands\n\nOn their home planet these cities had some of the most extensive libraries of any city. These were communally open to all elves who wished to expand their knowledge and better themselves.",
            "Relationships": "Out of all elven sub-races, these were among the least tolerant of other races. Grey elves almost never associated with other non-elven [[humanoid]]s for long or frequent periods of time. And they feared the possibility of other, shorter-lived races tainting their bloodline. However, members of other elven races often readily chose not to befriend them, for they disdained how arrogant and serious they were. Some even felt their behavior and way of life was comparable to that of [[human]]s or [[dwarves]].\n\nBecause they spent so much of their lives studying, grey elves had many elves of other races as servants for menial and physical labor.\n\nGrey elves allowed only a select few outsiders entry to their cities, such as very powerful [[mage]]s and wizards, but even these individuals were treated with great suspicion."
        },
        "Trivia": "* Some of the oral traditions of the gray elves spoke of [[Atropus]].\n* Visitors to Toril that were familiar with this race of elves sometimes suffered from confusion, due to the fact that the planet's silver elves, Though this term was considered by them to be a pejorative."
