        "Description": "Boobrie stood on two long, slender legs that ended in four toes that could stretch very wide in order to allow fast movement in its native marshy habitats. Their beaks had a similar shape to that of a [[heron]], but ended in a sharp serrated hook like that of an [[eagle]].",
        "Biology": "Due to their occasional dieting on creatures with [[poison]]ous bites, the boobrie were noted as having a general immunity to most mundane forms of poison.",
        "Combat": "Boobrie typically hunted by means of ambush, hiding within tall patches of [[grass]] for hours until some form of prey wandered by. Whenever they felt threatened or encountered a creature that was evidently too strong to take on they would fluff up their feathers to appear more imposing. The long feathers on their neck would cause them to appear {{SIrange|2|3|ft}} taller.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Boobrie generally subsisted on [[giant catfish]], [[human]] and [[sheep]]. Whenever there was a shortage of them boobries were known to eat [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, giant [[spider]]s, and other similarly small creatures known to inhabit wetlands.",
            "Relations": "In the village of [[Dhedluk (town)|Dhedluk]] in [[Cormyr]] they were domesticated and used as a form of pest control.<ref>"
        },
        "Myths & Rumors": "Some scholars speculated that they have may have in some way been related to [[roc]]s, despite them having little in common, based largely upon the fact that they were both large birds."
