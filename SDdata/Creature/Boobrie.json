        "mainbody": "Boobries (|audio=Boobrie.ogg) were a large relative of the stork.\nBoobrie stood on two long, slender legs that ended in four toes that could stretch very wide in order to allow fast movement in its native marshy habitats. Their beaks had a similar shape to that of a heron, but ended in a sharp serrated hook like that of an eagle.\nDue to their occasional dieting on creatures with poisonous bites, the boobrie were noted as having a general immunity to most mundane forms of poison.\nBoobrie typically hunted by means of ambush, hiding within tall patches of grass for hours until some form of prey wandered by. Whenever they felt threatened or encountered a creature that was evidently too strong to take on they would fluff up their feathers to appear more imposing. The long feathers on their neck would cause them to appear  taller.\nBoobrie generally subsisted on giant catfish, human and sheep. Whenever there was a shortage of them boobries were known to eat snakes, lizards, giant spiders, and other similarly small creatures known to inhabit wetlands.\nIn the village of Dhedluk in Cormyr they were domesticated and used as a form of pest control.\nSome scholars speculated that they have may have in some way been related to rocs, despite them having little in common, based largely upon the fact that they were both large birds."
