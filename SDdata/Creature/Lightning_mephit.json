        "mainbody": "A lightning mephit was a mephit from the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning.\nOut of all the mephits, lightning mephits were the fastest. They were described to move like a lightning bolt through the air. Lightning mephit arms were essentially thin bolts of lightning, and their feet and hands were cloud-like, resembling a storm cloud. Unlike many other mephits, they had no wings, but that didnt stop them from traveling extremely fast (sometimes so fast that they couldnt control their path).\nThey were hyperactive, curious, and spoke very quickly. They constantly desired to be involved in activities.\nCuriously, instead of engaging in combat, these mephits preferred to make friends with their opponents. Their lightning-bolt-like arms had no claws for attacking as regular mephits would. However, they could cause great damage if needed to, by casting lightning bolts within 80 ft (24 m). If they wished to cast further bolts, they would become slightly damaged.\nLightning mephits could gate in up to four other mephits of the same type. Non-magical weapons would not damage these mephits, and would, instead, cause damage to the attackers. As well as this, they were immune to fire and heat, as well as electric damage of all kinds. However, they were very weak against large amounts of water, which could destroy them. \nOn contact with an electrical source, lightning mephits would regenerate every single bit of damage. After gating in several other lightning mephits, they could consistently heal each other (only sacrificing a tiny amount of health to fully heal others), to the woe of uninformed enemies.\nUnlike all other mephits, lightning mephits were fairly often found in bands, instead of on their own."
