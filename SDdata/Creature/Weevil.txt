Weevils were tiny insect beetles that were known to be pests in food storage areas in Skullport.
In mid–14 century DR, weevils were a common sight in subterranean humanoid habitats. They often infested dungeons of Skullport, feeding on poorly kept sacks of flour and grains.
Some species of weevils were native to Maztica.
Weevils could be summoned alongside other crawling insects via the Maztican hishna spell pestilence.
* Elemental weevils, tiny smoldering critters that were found on the slopes of Mount Hotenow on the Sword Coast North.
