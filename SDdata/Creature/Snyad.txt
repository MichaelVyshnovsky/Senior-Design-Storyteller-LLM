Snyads, also known as pesties, were a wingless species of gremlin distantly related to jermlaines and mites.
On average, snyads grew to be  tall. They had humanoid bodies, light brown in coloration, resembling that of a mite, but standing taller and sporting full, messy heads of hair. And like all gremlins, they had large pointed ears.
Snyads had a great love for treasure, which they acted on compulsively.
These creatures were incredibly fast, silent, and quick in their reflexes. They surprised their targets the majority of the time and were skilled at snatching items right out of their very hands. However, they were not particularly strong.
Snyads were rather risk averse, avoiding physical combat whenever possible and relying on their quick reflexes to make quick getaways. If captured they would kick, scream, and squirm, but fearfully would never bite their captor.
These creatures lived in immediate families, marrying their partners for life.
Snyads lived within the Upperdark. There they lived similarly to their gremlin cousins, the jermlaine and mite, in that their lairs were maze-like systems of tiny chambers and passageways along major trade routes, allowing them to prey upon unwary travelers. The entrances to their tunnels were small and usually concealed behind piles of loose stone.
It was unknown if these creatures spoke any language, but they were observed communicating quite well with mites.
Snyads typically left their lairs to steal small items of treasure from demihuman and human passersby, such as gemstones or jewelry, sometimes or often times acting in cooperation with mites. Their quick speed complimented the latters skills in traps, who distracted the targets as the snyads swooped in to steal their goods.
They sometimes acted as servants of Brandobaris.
About  of snyad blood could be used as an ingredient for potions of diminution.
Following its destruction, snyads could be found in the ruins of Zhentil Keep.
