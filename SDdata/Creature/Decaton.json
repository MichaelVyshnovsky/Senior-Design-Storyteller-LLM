        "mainbody": "Decatons () were the lowest rank of hierarch modrons.\nDecatons were shaped like spheres atop stubby legs, with ten tentacles and four eyes evenly spaced around the sphere. At the top of the sphere was a mouth.\nLike all hierarch modrons, decatons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience, clairvoyance, command, dimension door, teleport without error, and wall of force spells at will.\nThey could communicate telepathically with anyone in a  radius. and could see in complete darkness from up to  away.\nDecatons were able to fly by generating a lifting gas that allowed it to be lighter than the surrounding air. They typically only did so whenever they were commanding large numbers of base modrons and needed to get an overview of their situation.\nIf forced into combat, a decaton used its tentacles in melee combat. They also heavily relied on their spellcasting abilities.\nThere were only 100 decatons in modron society. They could communicate with other decatons and with nonatons, and relayed their orders to pentadrones. One decaton was in charge of each of the 64 sectors of their realm in Mechanus, and the remaining 36 decatons served in the modron armies. They functioned as caretakers of the modrons under their command, looking after their physical welfare.\nDecatons were always created as the result of pentadrones being upgraded to take the place of destroyed or further promoted decatons.\nAround  Netherese archmage and explorer Lady Polaris came upon Mechanus and the modrons. She summoned several decatons to her home to guard her treasures, but was stymied as they kept disappearing after several days. She had more success with the pentadrones she focused on next."
