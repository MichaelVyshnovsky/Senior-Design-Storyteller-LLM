        "Description": "It was constructed by means of [[shadow magic]] and \"dark emotions\".",
        "History": "The wraith eidolon was created some time after Xin'kar was founded, following the [[Fall of Netheril]] in the {{YearlinkName|-339}}. It served as a protector for the Netherese scholars for some time until the [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s of the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] overran Xin'kar. During the invasion, the last remaining resident of Xin'kar attempted to activate the wraith eidolon, but could not reach it in time.\n\nIt remained in a state of dormancy for centuries until the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. A group of bandits broke into Xin'kar looking for ancient relics and inadvertently activated the wraith eidolon.\n\nSome time later, the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] delved into Xin'kar in order to recover ancient Uthgardt relic for the [[Forsworn]]. The hero dismantled the wraith eidolon once and for all."
