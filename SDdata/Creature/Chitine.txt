'''Chitines''' were [[humanoid]]s that resembled spiders and were found in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
Chitines were about {{SI|4|feet|long=yes}} tall and had four arms, each of which had an extra joint. Each of their hands and feet were embedded with claws, which allowed them to climb most surfaces. Their faces held faceted eyes and mandibles attached to their mouths. Chitines could spin webs from an opening in their stomach, and their skins secreted an oil which prevented them from sticking to their own webs.

==Combat==
When possible, chitines used their webs to create pitfall traps to catch enemies unawares. Their [[ambidexterity]] and hooks in their hands made them extremely difficult to disarm. They were, however, sensitive to sunlight and bright lights.

==Society==
Chitines were adept at using their webbing as construction materials to build their homes. They usually lived in villages of 40&ndash;60 individuals inside a cavern filled with maze-like webs connecting domed houses located on the walls, ceilings, and floors. In the center of the cavern was always a temple to [[Lolth]]. The leaders of each village were [[choldrith]]s, chitine priests that were in fact a different species. Chitines did not practice [[arcane magic]].

Chitines were found throughout the [[Upperdark|upper]] and [[Middledark|middle]]-[[Northdark]], but the majority lived in several connected villages (at least seven in total) known cumulatively as [[Yathchol]], located beneath the [[Far Forest]]. and some inhabitants of [[Sshamath]]. A few chitines also lived in the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] in [[Shadowdale]].

Chitines hated drow and [[drider]]s.

==History==
[[File:Chitine 2e.jpg|thumb|''A depiction of a chitine from [[Spellfire: Master the Magic]].]]
In the 13th century [[DR]], chitines were created by [[Ched Nasad]]an [[wizard]]s of [[House Mylyl]] as failed slave experiments. In the {{YearlinkName|1305}}, the chitines rebelled from drow enslavement and founded Yathchol.

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Forgotten Ones]]&mdash;driders of [[T'lindhet]]&mdash;negotiated a defense pact with a group of chitines and planned to attack T'lindhet.{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Dungeons|2}} In that same year, the nobles of [[House Teh'Kinrellz]] were saved from destruction because they were out on a chitine hunt during the fall of Ched Nasad.

In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, the [[Selvetarm]]-worshiping drow [[Dhairn]] agreed to provide the secrets of creating chitines to the [[dracolich]] [[Daurgothoth]] as part of a deal in exchange for magic items and the use of [[Dolblunde]] as a base of operations.
