        "mainbody": "Xantravars, also known as stinging horrors, were a bizarre species of deadly predators found near inland bodies of water.\nThe floating body of a xantravar consisted of two tough, highly elastic, teardrop-shaped balloons of roughly the same size. These bulbs were mottled, ranging in color from wine-red to gray. Each of the xantravars bulbs ended in strong corded muscles, with an identical hollow bone stinger at their base.\nAbove each of these stingers were a set of eight eyes, that ringed around each body stalk. Above the eyes, encircling each body-stalk, was a ring of indentations that emitted ventral jets of hydrogen gas from inside the creature. This expulsion of gas allowed xantravars to steer their body or sink closer to the ground conversely, the intake of air through those vents made the xantravars rise. And above these jets, in the large head of each bulb, were two flotation chambers where the hydrogen gas was stored. Puncturing these flotation chambers was severely harmful to the xantravar.\nThe body bulbs were joined together by ceaseless, glowing energy field that smelled of ozone. the length of this field could vary, but the balloons were typically side-by-side with a distance apart of . When hunting or exploring, they could be seen as far apart as  and vertically separated by up to . The energy field also looked together the network of nerves that ran throughout each body bulb.\nTheir eyesight was comparable to that of a human and they could see in infravision. They possessed an immunity to all known toxins and a basic magic resistance.\nThe xantravars field of energy was natural in nature, unaffected by things such as dispel magic, but would disrupt other fields of force that made contact with it. This field of energy notably separated hydrogen from the surrounding air or water. This effect of the field could be augmented by spells involving heat, electrical energy, or magical energy. However, the body bulbs of a xantravar were vulnerable to such attacks and would be simultaneously harmed.\nOne of the xantravars two stingers contained a paralyzing poison, which would inject creatures at the merest scratch. Once used, it took the xantravar some minutes to replenish their toxins. Those that managed to resist the effects of their sting would be forever immune to that particular xantravars venom.\nThe other stinger of a xantravar was a feeding instrument. Through a strong suction force it drew blood, sap, or nutrient fluid from their prey.\nThese creatures preferred to hunt at night or in the concealment of heavy fog. During any serious combat, a xantraver would seek to protect itself by separating its body bulbs by up to .\nThe xantravar were rather shrouded in mystery. They were believed to hunt alone, but coexisted peacefully with others of their kind in deep flooded caverns or swamps during the day. During that time they avoided large, active creatures and fed instead on plants or disabled prey.\nXantravars were a hermaphroditic species.Older sources may use \"bisexual\" to mean a creature has two biological sexes, which is an older, original meaning of the word. To avoid confusion, this wiki adopts \"hermaphroditic\". They seldom ever mated, but when they did xantravars joined their hollow stingers together and produced a balloon-like egg. This would drift alone on the breeze, unattended, for weeks. During such time the egg would absorb hydrogen and nutrients from the air. Eventually, this egg would burst to reveal a miniature version of the xantravar, with body bulbs measuring  in length. These infants fended for themselves and would grow rapidly to their adult size.\nXantravars primarily lived on a diet of blood, sap, and bodily nutrients. Though they could also dine upon vegetation.\nXantravars were typically found in swamps, salt marshes, and remote seacoasts with tidal caverns."
