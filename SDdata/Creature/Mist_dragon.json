        "mainbody": "Mist dragons were reclusive and antisocial dragons found along coastlines.\nMist dragons had blue to white scales with metallic spots that became more grey as the dragon aged. Its eyes were oceanic colors, usually green, with silver pupils that became more prominent until most of the eye was silver. Mist dragons physical characteristics included a fin running from the head to the end of its flattened tail. Their head thinned in an arrow-like shape from the snout and ended in a thick neck. Heavy ridges lay over the eyes, two horns protruded from the back of the skull, and clusters of smaller horns sat at the base of its upper jaw.\nThe mist dragon gave off a rain-like odor.\nthumb|A mist dragon, flying through a waterfall mist.\nMist dragons were asocial creatures that secluded themselves inside their lairs where they desired no interaction with sentient creatures, spent large periods of time in contemplation, and avoided combat whenever possible.\nMist dragons had two breath weapons. One was a caustic slime that caused nausea in enemies, typically used to avoid combat where possible. The other was a scalding cone of mist that was used for offensive purposes.\nMist dragons could change form similar to the spell gaseous form. While in this form the dragon was practically invisible in its natural habitat as it appeared to be a cloud of mist, but its flight capabilities were hindered.\nWhen fully grown, mist dragons could cast all of the following spells fog cloud, sleet storm, wind wall, gust of wind, solid fog, control water and control weather.\nMist dragons were commonly found in coastal regions or temperate regions where it rained often, such as grottoes or jungles.\nBeyond Toril, mist dragons could be found on the planet of Oerth.\nThe locales that mist dragons tended to inhabit, forests and coasts, often put them in conflict with green dragons and bronze dragons respectively. The latter were usually content to ignore mist dragons, but green dragons were often aggressive. A mist dragon would avoid contact for as long as possible until attacking out of frustration or impatience.\nSome mist dragons acted as servants of the deities Eilistraee, Thard Harr, Rillifane Rallathil, and Sehanine Moonbow.\n* Cirrothamalan\n* Narnardinath\n* Ouranalathra\n* Thalagyrt\n* Wyvernvapor"
