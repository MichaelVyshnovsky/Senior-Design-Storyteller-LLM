        "mainbody": "'''Swamp striders''' were a species of swarming, predatory insects that could walk across bodies of water thanks to their physiology.",
        "Description": "These insects were about the size of mundane [[beetle]]s, measuring {{SI|7|in|long=yes}} in length and weighing {{SI|0.5|lb|k|long=yes}}. They had dangerously long, spiked suckers.",
        "Abilities": "Swamp striders could see in areas of [[Darkvision|total darkness]], as well as sense creatures within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of them walking in the same body of water. \n\nThese insects were capable of walking across water as if effected by ''[[water walk]]'' and would even float to the surface if submerged.",
        "Combat": "When in a swarm, swamp striders would surround and attack living warm-blooded prey larger than them. They pierced them with their suckers to cause bleeding.",
        "Sub-Species": {
            "Underdark strider": "Swamp striders that inhabited the lakes and seas of the [[Underdark]], such as the [[Lightless Sea]], differed from their surface brethren in that they had a white coloration and were [[Blindsight|blind]]."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "These creatures subsisted upon blood.",
            "Habitats": "Swamp striders were found within warm marshes of the Realms. They were particularly known to inhabit the [[Adder Swamp]] of [[Chessenta]] and the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]], often terrorizing the inhabitants of the latter.",
            "Usages": "Some [[humanoid]] races hunted swamp strider swarms on occasion, considering them to be a fine delicacy when roasted."
        },
        "History": "Around [[1372 DR]], swamp striders were counted among the many creatures that one could only rarely encounter while traversing the [[sewers of Waterdeep]]."
