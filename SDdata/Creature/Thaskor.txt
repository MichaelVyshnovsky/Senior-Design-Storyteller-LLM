A thaskor was a hulking, elephantine shadow beast, a group of outsiders native to the Plane of Shadow.
Thaskors were elephant-like creatures  long and weighing , most of it muscle. Their skin was thick and gray. Thaskors were quadrupedal, normally walking on all four legs, but they were capable of standing on the shorter hind pair in order to fight better with their front legs.
Thaskors were deceptive, cunning, and capable of subtlety despite their brutish appearance. They enjoyed charging opponents in combat and using the sheer weight of their bodies to bowl enemies over. Thaskors were always lawful evil.
Thaskors, like other shadow beasts, had darkvision and spoke the Abyssal, Common, and Infernal languages. They were immune to poison, and resistant to attacks that utilized acid, cold, electricity, and fire.
In combat, thaskors relied on slamming opponents with the full force of their body weight and on their trumpeting blast ability. This ability allowed a thaskor to unleash a cone of sound that could potentially stun anyone within a  cone.
Thaskors were native to the Plane of Shadow, where they, like the other shadow beasts, worked as soldiers for various warlords who lived in that place. Thaskors sometimes ventured to the Material Plane as mercenaries. On their home plane, thaskors did not fight with the other kinds of shadow beasts, but neither would they work in the same squad as the others. When sent to the Material Plane, however, they were known to work with khumats.
Thaskors did not use their tusks in combat. This was a major point of pride for them, and one that they would uphold unto death if necessary.
