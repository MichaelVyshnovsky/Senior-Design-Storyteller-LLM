'''Quicklings''' were a small speedy species of [[fey]].
{{Quote|They race themselves to death, and scheme as fast as they can run.|[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to Monsters'']], [[Elminster]], late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]}}

==Description==
Quicklings were {{SIAdj|2|ft|adj=tall}} humanoid fey of slender build, similar in appearance to an [[elf]], but with sharper, more feral features.

==Personality==
They were cruel, devious,

==Abilities==
The most distinct aspect of quicklings was their blindingly fast movement. This made them indistinct blurs whose words could not be properly heard or understood.

Some quicklings were natural spellcasters, capable of casting ''[[ventriloquism]]'', ''[[forget]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[shatter]]'', ''[[dig]]'', and ''[[fire charm]]'' at will.

==Combat==
Quicklings typically fought their enemies with [[dagger]]s or [[shortsword]]s. They liked to set ambushes and outwit their enemies, partially relying upon their speed to do so. They generally focused their attacks on weaker-looking adversaries while dodging the tougher ones.

==History==
Quicklings were once a taller race of lazy and egotistical fey, but after being late in answering summons from the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]] one too many times she transformed them. Making them incredibly fast, shorter in stature, and reducing their lifespan to an average of fifteen years.

===Languages===
Quicklings spoke their own language, as well as those of the [[brownie]]s, [[pixie]]s, [[Halfling language|halflings]], and [[Elven language|elves]]; like all fey, they spoke [[Sylvan]]. However, they could not be properly understood unless they deliberately slowed down while speaking.

===Habitats===
They were often found within forests, both in the [[Feywild]] and on the [[Prime Material plane]], where the [[Unseelie Court]] held sway.

===Relations===
Quicklings readily allied themselves with other evil fey. In the Feydark they were known to serve as elite spies, assassins, and saboteurs for [[fomorian]] rulers, who often sent them to infiltrate or perform reconnaissance on other societies in the Feywild.{{Cite dragon/362/The Eye of Madness: Tyrants of the Feydark}}

[[Druid]]s were frequent targets of their pranks, especially those who served [[Titania]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Their original race was unknown, though some speculated that they may have once been [[brownie]]s,{{Cite dragon/155/Folk of the Faerie Kingdom|37}}
