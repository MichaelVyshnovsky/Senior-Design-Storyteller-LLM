Quicklings were a small speedy species of fey.
 century DR
Quicklings were  humanoid fey of slender build, similar in appearance to an elf, but with sharper, more feral features.
They were cruel, devious,
The most distinct aspect of quicklings was their blindingly fast movement. This made them indistinct blurs whose words could not be properly heard or understood.
Some quicklings were natural spellcasters, capable of casting ventriloquism, forget, levitate, shatter, dig, and fire charm at will.
Quicklings typically fought their enemies with daggers or shortswords. They liked to set ambushes and outwit their enemies, partially relying upon their speed to do so. They generally focused their attacks on weaker-looking adversaries while dodging the tougher ones.
Quicklings were once a taller race of lazy and egotistical fey, but after being late in answering summons from the Queen of Air and Darkness one too many times she transformed them. Making them incredibly fast, shorter in stature, and reducing their lifespan to an average of fifteen years.
Quicklings spoke their own language, as well as those of the brownies, pixies, halflings, and elves like all fey, they spoke Sylvan. However, they could not be properly understood unless they deliberately slowed down while speaking.
They were often found within forests, both in the Feywild and on the Prime Material plane, where the Unseelie Court held sway.
Quicklings readily allied themselves with other evil fey. In the Feydark they were known to serve as elite spies, assassins, and saboteurs for fomorian rulers, who often sent them to infiltrate or perform reconnaissance on other societies in the Feywild.
Druids were frequent targets of their pranks, especially those who served Titania.
Their original race was unknown, though some speculated that they may have once been brownies,
