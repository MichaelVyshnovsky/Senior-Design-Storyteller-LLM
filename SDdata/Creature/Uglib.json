        "Description": "The Uglib was a very ugly beast, having beady eyes, mottled tufts of hair, and a stubby tail. Some specimens of the breed even grew bone spurs, though these were harmless. Behind this unfortunate appearance, these creatures were far tougher and stronger than the common donkey and especially stable on their hooves.",
        "History": "So common were these animals among the dwarves and gnomes that magic ''[[portal]]''s were even created for the sole purpose of transporting them from mine to mine."
