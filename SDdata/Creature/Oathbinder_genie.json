Their sole purpose was to maintain oaths sworn between their master and other beings. They punished any oathbreaker based on the terms of their vow.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Monstrous Compendium Pages}}\n\nThe creation of the first oathbinder genie could be traced back to an efreeti named [[Mulahid]] and his affections for the Grandmother of the [[Everlasting]] who used her beguiling charm to bind him into service.",
        "Description": "The skin of oathbinder genies was glossy black, like obsidian. A glow of white fire enveloped their bodies at all times. Their eyes burned fiercely with purple fire.",
        "Abilities": "An oathbinder genie would only be seen when the terms of their contracts required them, usually when someone broke an oath. They magically arrived within minutes of a broken oath.\n\nOathbinder genies were completely immune to any physical or magical attack from the creature who broke their oath. The spirit of an oathbreaker slain by an oathbinder genie was captured and held by the oathbinder for years at a time. During this period the spirit could not be contacted by magical or priestly means.\n\nOathbinders could use the following [[spell]]-like abilities three times per day: ''[[command]]'', ''[[evil eye]]'', ''[[greater malison]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[otilukeâ€™s resilient sphere]]'', ''[[unluck]]'', ''[[wall of force]]''.",
