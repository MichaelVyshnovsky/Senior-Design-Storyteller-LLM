        "mainbody": "striliths were {{SI|10|ft}} long creatures resembling segmented eels with bulging, unblinking eyes, and mouths full of pin-like fangs. A powerful tail attached to their humanoid upper body, with arms ending in claws. They were already very large creatures, but could grow to truly immense size.",
        "Description": "Wastriliths were {{SI|10|ft}} long creatures resembling segmented eels with bulging, unblinking eyes, and mouths full of pin-like fangs. A powerful tail attached to their humanoid upper body, with arms ending in claws. They were already very large creatures, but could grow to truly immense size.",
        "Personality": "Wastriliths were most easily described as arrogant bullies. They intimidated others into submission and terrorized their environment among other awful activities. Their influence could be especially dangerous when they encouraged people of evil temperament to become pirates and other criminals.",
        "Abilities": "Although wastriliths could move on land, they were generally faster swimmers, and better combatants in water. They fought with their claws and fangs, but could also breathe boiling water to attack their prey. Their complete immunity to cold temperatures was contrasted by their susceptibility to hot temperatures. They were master manipulators of water, corrupting it simply by being near it, able to alter currents to block or move their enemies, and being immune to any effects involving it, including their own boiling water attacks. Those who drank from water corrupted by a wastrilith found it to be incredibly poisonous, maddening those that it did not kill. This effect did not apply to other demons, who found their foul water restorative to drink.\n\nThey had a large number of magical abilities. In addition to the powers common to most demons, they could cast ''[[control water]]'', ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[greater dispelling]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[wall of ice]]'', as often as they wanted. Their ability to cast ''teleport without error'' was limited to themselves and up to 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) of goods, and their ability to cast ''tongues'' was also limited to casting on themselves. Other magical abilities of theirs included the ones to cast any of the ''[[symbol]]'' spells, as well as ''[[summon monster IX]]'' up three times every day, though the latter power was limited to summoning aquatic monsters.",
        "Combat": "Wastriliths saw no reason to unnecessarily put themselves into danger when they had subjects to do that for them. Unless all of their minions were defeated they were content to let battles unfold without intervening.",
        "Society/Ecology": {
            "Blood War": "It often fell to the wastriliths to conduct the marine affairs of the [[Blood War]], gathering aquatic entities to repel sea-faring invaders and traveling through the River Styx to make offensive strikes against [[Hell]]. They delighted in capsizing Baatorian ships in order to cause legions of lesser devils to fall into the river, thus giving them all amnesia and inducing chaos in their ranks. No one actually forced them to fight, their warring being an extension of their fight for supremacy in the waves of the lower planes."
