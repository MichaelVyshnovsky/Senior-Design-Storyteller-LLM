        "mainbody": "'''Tlincallis''', also know as '''manscorpions''', '''scorpion folk''', '''scorpionmen''', and '''stingers''', were terrifying monstrous humanoids with the lower bodies of [[giant scorpion]]s.{{Cite dragon/199/The Known World: Fantastic Heraldry|46}}",
        "Description": "The upper part of a tlincalli was the upper body of a [[human]]. The lower part of the tlincalli's body was of a six-legged giant scorpion.<ref group=\"note\">2{{nd}}-edition sources state that a tlincalli has six legs, while images in 3{{rd}}- and 5{{th}}-edition sources show them with eight legs. Plates of armor made from bone covered the body from the upper abdomen down. Tlincallis were completely hairless. Their hands were not dexterous, as they had two large fingers and a thumb.",
        "Combat": "Tlincallis were organized warriors. As they frequently patrolled their territory, squadrons of six to eight warriors were most often encountered by other creatures. The leader of the squadron was also the only spellcaster in the group. The favored weapons of tlincallis were [[bolas]] and [[maca]]s. \n\nA standard tlincalli tactic was to engage an opponent from afar, using their bolas or other ranged weapons. Afterwards, they charged and surrounded their target, engaging in fierce melee combat. In addition to using a maca, they used their sharp claws and strong tail to knock opponents off their feet. The stinger at the end of their tails delivered a fatal venom. Additionally, their bony armor was covered in poison. \n\nAnother favored tactic was to engage an enemy from below (or if fighting underground, occasionally from above). They possessed a supernatural ability to drive their bodies straight through solid earth, suffering minor injuries in the process but granting them the ability to strike swiftly and without warning from unexpected directions.\n\nBoth female and male tlincallis were trained and skilled in combat.",
        "Abilities": "Tlincalli spellcasters used [[Divine magic|divine]] spells, including [[hishnashaper]] spells. They were capable of detecting the vibrations of a walking creature up to {{SI|60|ft}} away.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Tlincallis were pessimistic and also had a devout belief in omens and portents. They were ferocious fighters due to their belief that their death was predetermined. Their belief in divination was so strong that the ruling caste of a tlincalli settlement were diviners.\n\nAbout one in five tlincallis were [[cleric]]s. The tlincalli pantheon contained at least nine major and two minor [[deities]]. They used their own zodiac system, which was composed of eleven symbols. Little was known about the tlincalli religion, but it was understood that [[Huoxopica]] and his wife [[Ixtilli]] were the two main gods and [[Corantllil]] was the tlincalli god of continual labor. The [[cleric]]s of some tlincalli tribes worshiped [[Nula]], [[Plutoq]], or [[Zaltec]]."

        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "The poisonous coating of a tlincalli's bony armor was sought after by [[alchemist]]s, who extracted it and used it as a component."
        },
        "History": "Tlincalli originated in [[Maztica]] and eventually spread to [[Faerûn]]'s [[Underdark]]. They met little resistence to this incursion save for  some creatures of [[elemental fire]] that had previously inhabited the ruins of Xothaerin, namely [[salamander]]s and [[efreeti]].\n\nAround {{Yearlink|1367}},{{AQ-time}} a unit of two thousand enslaved tlincallis was part of the army of the [[City of Brass]]. The unit was called the [[Black Darts]], and they used [[javelin]]s in battle.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1372}}, the tlincallis had fully secured their new realm beneath Amn, and had begun sending out scouting parties to explore the nearby regions of the Underdark.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1374}}, tlincallis erupted from the Underdark beneath Amn and attacked [[Murann]] and settlements along the [[Trade Way]] from the [[Cloud Peaks]] to the [[Forest of Tethir]]. They demanded recompense for all treasure looted from Maztica.",
        "Trivia": "When a tlincalli was used in heraldic designs, it represented readiness and betrayal."
