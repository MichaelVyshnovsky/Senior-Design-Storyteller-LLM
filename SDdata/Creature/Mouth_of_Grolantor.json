        "mainbody": "'''Mouths of Grolantor''' were [[hill giant]]s that had been isolated from their peers and driven insane through prolonged starvation. After contracting a persisting sickness, often due to food poisoning, these extremely destructive giants were dangerous forces of voracity, and seen by other hill giants as a living embodiment of [[Grolantor]]'s eternal hunger.",
        "Description": "As opposed to the typical bloated and barely awake hill giant, mouths of Grolantor were thin to the point of emaciation, extremely alert, and twitchy around the edges.",
        "Personality": "As a result of their prolonged starvation and imprisonment, mouths of Grolantor were completely insane, and as a result undeterred by fear of magical ''[[confusion]]''. They killed indiscriminately and lashed out toward anything, be it a creature or otherwise, that they perceived as edible. Their rampage lasted until they were defeated or had eaten their fill, subsequently passing out among the remains of their destruction.",
        "Abilities": "Mouths of Grolantor were quicker than normal hill giants. For whatever reason, they magically recovered from injury when they consumed the flesh of others.",
        "Combat": "The utter madness of mouths of Grolantor made them impossible to predict in combat. They ran towards the nearest possible source of food and relentlessly attacked creatures at random within reach, sometimes bursting into a rage when that was impossible. They were even known to occasionally punch themselves or fall into a temporary stupor while in the middle of a fight. Their rampage lasted until they were defeated or had eaten their fill, after which they would pass out amidst the remains of their destruction.",
        "Society": "Thanks to their extremely resilient bodies, it was extremely rare for hill giants to become sick or poisoned by food. For that reason, it was a source of great upheaval and confusion when they did become ill or showed an incapacity to keep food down. Hill giants had developed their own superstition about this abnormality, determining that when a hill giant vomited, it was because Grolantor was attempting to use them to communicate to his followers.\n\nA sickened hill giant was kept isolated from the rest of his tribe, and often restrained by being tied to a post or kept in a cage. A hill giant priest or chieftain would frequently visit them, and attempt to interpret signs of Grolantor amid the regurgitated bile.  If the hill giant recovered, they were permitted to rejoin society (and would likely learn nothing from the experience) and otherwise would be intentionally starved to the point of madness. The hill giants believed that by doing so, they were allowing Grolantor a mouth with which his aching hunger could manifest in the world. \n\nA mouth of Grolantor was not regarded as a person, but as a holy vessel for Grolantor's divine voracity. They were kept restrained in perpetuity, and rarely set loose on purpose. One that did break free would be sure to kill a few hill giants before being brought down or escaping to go on a killing spree. On the other hand, the emaciated creatures might be unleased during raid, or as a last-ditch defense mechanism when they were under attack. Their tendency to pass out after sating their need to devour and destroy made them easy to recapture."
