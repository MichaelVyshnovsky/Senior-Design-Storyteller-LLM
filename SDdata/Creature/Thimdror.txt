A thimdror was a breed of oxen. They were small, broad-shouldered animals with ugly bald and almost triangular, reptilian heads.
Thimdrors could live to be up to 30 years old if they lived in areas with the appropriate conditions, as they couldnt tolerate either very hot climates or specially cold winters.
Although incredibly strong, the thimdrors were not favored as draft beasts because of their small size and stupid behavior. However, they were highly prized all around the Realms for their delicious marbled meat.
Around 1479 DR, it was rumored that the farmer Nars Thormil, who lived near Wheloon in Cormyr, used a deepspawn he had captured to duplicate thimdrors and sell them to the best eateries in Saerloon and other nearby settlements.
