        "mainbody": "A living Bigbys hand was a giant and incorporeal hand created from pure force energy. It was a living manifestation of the Bigbys hand family of spells.\nBigbys hands often served as protectors for the spellcasters that brought them to life.\nDue to their unique nature, living Bigbys hands were immune to much that would harm other living beings. They could never become physically exhausted, terrified, or rendered unconscious, and could not be blinded or deafened. They were wholly impervious to charm spells, petrification, and paralysis.\nWhen forced into combat, Bigbys hands often attacked in a manner similar to its namesake spells. They could punch out at foes by clenching themself into a fist or by grapping opponents and hurling them away.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, several living Bigbys hands lingered in the ruined necropolis of Ythryn."
