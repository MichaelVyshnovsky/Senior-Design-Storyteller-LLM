        "mainbody": "A '''living Bigby's hand''' was a giant and incorporeal hand created from pure [[force energy]]. It was a living manifestation of the ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' family of spells.",
        "Behavior": "Bigby's hands often served as protectors for the spellcasters that brought them to life.",
        "Abilities": "Due to their unique nature, living Bigby's hands were immune to much that would harm other living beings. They could never become physically exhausted, terrified, or rendered unconscious, and could not be blinded or deafened. They were wholly impervious to [[charm]] spells, [[petrification]], and paralysis.",
        "Combat": "When forced into combat, Bigby's hands often attacked in a manner similar to its namesake spells. They could punch out at foes by ''[[Bigby's clenched fist|clenching themself into a fist]]'' or by ''[[Bigby's grasping hand|grapping opponents]] and hurling them away.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], several living Bigby's hands lingered in the ruined necropolis of [[Ythryn]]."
