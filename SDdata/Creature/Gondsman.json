        "mainbody": "'''Gondsmen''' were mechanical [[construct]]s crafted by [[techsmith]]s, who spent much of their time researching and working on them in their spare time before becoming fullfledged techsmiths. They acted as companions to their creators, in a way analogous to a [[sorcerer]] and a [[familiar]].",
        "Description": "Gondsmen were constructed of metal and wood. They came in either small or human-sized varieties.",
        "Personality": "Gondsmen could vary in their intelligence, but they always viewed the world through a somewhat detached, mechanical perspective that was ripe for misunderstandings.",
        "Abilities": "Due to the materials they were constructed of, gondsmen were vulnerable to [[spell]]s or spell-like abilities, such as ''[[rusting grasp]]'' or ''[[warp wood]]''. And likewise could be repaired with ''[[mending]]''.\n\nGondsmen shared an empathic link with their techsmith creator, out to a distance of {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}}. This allowed them to communicate telepathically.",
        "Combat": "Gondsmen would fight with any equipment that was appropriate for their size.",
        "History": "Following the [[Spellplague]], the knowledge of how to create these constructs was lost.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Sense of Wonder|32}}",
        "Notable Gondsmen": "* [[Crunch (Gondsman)|Crunch]]"
