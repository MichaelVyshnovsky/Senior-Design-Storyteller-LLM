        "mainbody": "Giant toads were monstrous varieties of the mundane animals of the same name.\nIn terms of physical description, giant toads completely matched normal toads, except in size. or \"warty\" as some described it, often rough to the touch. However, their appearance varied between species. The base species of giant toad has colorations ranging from weak brown to iron red.\nOn average the base species of giant toad grew up to be  in length.\nDue to their extended size, a giant toad could jump up to  high, and across gaps that were  wide, even from being completely stationary.\nthumb|A red-skinned dangerous giant toad caught in mid-croak.\nFire toad\n A variety of giant toad that was capable of launching fireballs from its mouth. Unlike other giant toad species, they had hydrophobia rather than a fear of fire.\nIce toad\n A highly intelligent variety of giant toad that were adapted for life in cold habitats.\nPoisonous toad\n A variety of giant toad that largely looked the same as the mundane variety. However, their bodies secreted a type of poison through their skin. They were less common than the standard giant toad.\nGiant toads were a carnivorous species, liable to attempt to devour anything that appeared edible. They were often attracted to settled areas, where they preyed upon livestock such as chickens, goats, and even sheep.\nGiant toads preferred to live in temperate areas with bodies of water they could lay their eggs in. Though they were species that survived in rather cool or dry environments.\nThey often made their homes underground, enjoying both the damp air and steady supply of food such environments offered them. Because of this, they occasionally be found within the sewers of cities.\nIn northwest Faer没n, giant toads could be found within the Mere of Dead Men. In interior Faer没n they could be found in the Farsea Marshes, the Marsh of Tun, and the Vast Swamp. In southeast Faer没n they could be found in the Great Swamp of Rethild.\nBeyond Faer没n, they could be found in the prairie regions of Semphar."
