        "Description": "Lantanese clockroaches were small bug-like constructs the size of a [[dog]]. Their faces sprouted sharp pincers and a nozzle that could discharge deadly [[acid]] and often dripped when inactive.\n\nMost commonly, clockroaches were made out of [[brass]] or [[bronze]], with [[steel]] and [[iron]] specimens being a rare occurrence.",
        "Abilities": "Similarly to bugs, clockroaches could climb as fast as they could move and burrow through earth and stone with ease. This was thanks to clockroaches' legs being covered in tiny hooks.",
        "Behavior": "Clockroaches did not have autonomy. They were controlled by a ''command amulet'' and performed tasks assigned by an individual who possessed the amulet. In order to program a clockroach, its master had to place the ''command amulet'' into a slot on the construct's carapace. Instructions could be at most twenty-five words. One such amulet was valued at 2,150 [[gp]].",
        "Combat": "Apart from their sharp pincers, clockroaches' main weapon was the magically-replenishing acid the creatures sprayed out of nozzles on their faces. The acid spray had the reach of {{SI|30'|'\"|long=yes}}. Clockroaches only attacked when explicitly instructed to do so, when ordered to clean an area, or in self-defense.",
        "Ecology": "Like other constructs, clockroaches needed no air, food, water, nor sleep.",
        "History": "[[File:Clockroach samarach.png|thumb|''A clockroach from the Lantan-Samarach portal logging camp.'']]\nClockroaches originated from the island nation of [[Lantan]] – creations of [[Gond]]'s [[Wondermaker]]s. Due to their usefulness, clockroaches were exported out of Lantan and used across many places throughout the [[Sword Coast]]. One explorer attempted to use a horde of clockroaches to clear a way to a certain ruin in the jungles of [[Chult]]. The plan was an utter failure, unleashing a swarm of clockroaches into the wild with the detective to devour.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, clockroaches were used by the [[Lantanna]] [[artificer]]s who ran an illegal logging operation in the jungles of [[Samarlogh]]. The ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' was at the center of the logging camp, guarded by numerous clockroaches, Lantanese [[blade spider]]s, and other constructs, maintained by [[Ahri|Ahri \"Golemkin\"]]. Some of the Lantanese clockroaches came in easily transportable collapsible configurations.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, a single clockroach belonged to [[Halaster's Heirs]] who resided on the [[Dungeon Level]] of the mega-dungeon underneath [[Waterdeep]] – [[Undermountain]]."
