A '''mist horror''' was a spirit of an [[evil]] being that was originally from the [[Demiplane of Dread]]. A more powerful version of a mist horror was known as a '''wandering horror'''.

==Description==
Mist horrors had no fixed shape, and could take whatever form and size they like, but usually appeared the size of [[human]]s. They were a form of [[undead]], and as such could be ''[[turn undead|turned]]'' by experienced [[cleric]]s. However, they could not be harmed by [[holy water]] or by other forms of damage that usually harmed undead.

Though very similar, wandering horrors were more dangerous versions of mist horrors and had chaotic dispositions. They seemed to be locked into more specific shapes, reflective of their evil deeds during their life. Wandering horrors were slightly more powerful in combat but, other than these differences, were essentially the same as mist horrors.

==Behavior==
Mist horrors could take the form of that which their enemies were afraid of, as well as sending them horrifying thoughts.

==Combat==
The horrors often caught their opponents off-guard after they had assembled their desired physical forms. They struck out once their foes had stopped moving, in any way their form allowed, though they were limited to using two attacks in single maneuvers.

==Abilities==
These spirits could only be hit with [[weapon]]s of ''+2'' [[enchantment]] or higher. They also had innate [[magic resistance]] auras that spanned {{SI|20|ft|long=yeS}} and so would cancel [[spell]]s that were cast in the area. As this was in the form of telepathic waves, only spells directly cast were affected, and not spells from items, such as [[wand]]s. In addition to their magic resistance, they could not be ''[[charm]]ed'', as they were essentially incorporeal, and thus were also immune to being ''[[blind]]ed''.

==Ecology==
Despite originating from the Demiplane of Dread, both mist and wandering horrors were known to exist around [[Faer√ªn]]. There they were often found in the company of [[poison mist]]s and [[vampiric mist]]s.
