        "Description": "Ogrillons looked very similar to orcs. Roughly 10% of ogrillons inherited the physical attributes of their ogre parentage and were clearly distinguishable from other orcs.",
        "Behavior": "Ogrillons lived in tribes. They often cooperated with orcs and were regularly used by orc groups as extra muscle.\n\nDespite little use for [[currency]], ogrillons often considered [[gold]] coins lucky and most ogrillons carried coins with them.\n\nAlthough most ogrillons pursued [[barbarian]] or [[fighter]] roles, some chose to become [[shaman]]s.",
        "Combat": "Ogrillons thrived in combat and were uncomfortable and restless if not in a battle.",
        "Ecology": "Ogrillons were carnivorous.",
        "History": "As of [[1370 DR]], ogrillons were one of the many creatures used as slaves in [[Menzoberranzan]]. At some point, the second house of Menzoberranzan ([[House Barrison Del'Armgo]]) owned roughly 250 slave ogrillons.",
        "Notable ogrillons": ";[[Ragnor]]\n:Ragnor was a fighter and one of the military leaders of [[Castle Trinity]].\n;[[Grguch]]\n:Grguch was the leader of the ogrillion tribe known as [[Clan Karuck]].\n;[[Hakuun]]\n:Hakuun was the shaman of the ogrillon tribe Clan Karuck. Around [[1372 DR]], Hakuun became the chief advisor to the clan's leader, Grguch."
