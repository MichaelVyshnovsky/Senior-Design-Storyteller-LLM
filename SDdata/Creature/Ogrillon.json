        "mainbody": "Ogrillons ( ) were the result of orcs and ogres breeding.\nOgrillons looked very similar to orcs. Roughly 10% of ogrillons inherited the physical attributes of their ogre parentage and were clearly distinguishable from other orcs.\nOgrillons lived in tribes. They often cooperated with orcs and were regularly used by orc groups as extra muscle.\nDespite little use for currency, ogrillons often considered gold coins lucky and most ogrillons carried coins with them.\nAlthough most ogrillons pursued barbarian or fighter roles, some chose to become shamans.\nOgrillons thrived in combat and were uncomfortable and restless if not in a battle.\nOgrillons were carnivorous.\nAs of 1370 DR, ogrillons were one of the many creatures used as slaves in Menzoberranzan. At some point, the second house of Menzoberranzan (House Barrison DelArmgo) owned roughly 250 slave ogrillons.\nRagnor\nRagnor was a fighter and one of the military leaders of Castle Trinity.\nGrguch\nGrguch was the leader of the ogrillion tribe known as Clan Karuck.\nHakuun\nHakuun was the shaman of the ogrillon tribe Clan Karuck. Around 1372 DR, Hakuun became the chief advisor to the clans leader, Grguch."
