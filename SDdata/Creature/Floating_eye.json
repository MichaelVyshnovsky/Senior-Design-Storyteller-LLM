        "mainbody": "Floating eyes were a rare, small species of mono-eyed fish.\nThese fish had a transparency to their body that made them practically invisible while in the water. The only visible portion of them while in water was their single, large eye. This had a milky-white hue with a large black pupil and measured about  in diameter.\nFloating eyes swam at very rapid speeds.\nThese fish had a very mild demeanor and were relatively non-aggressive.\nTo those who gazed into it, tiny bolts of light appeared to streak out of the floating eyes pupil every few seconds. Any creature within  of a floating eye that gazed into its pupil could potentially be hypnotized, becoming paralyzed. Upon death their eyes lost this trait.\nThese fish were very poor fighters. They relied primarily upon their defensive ability and other predatory creatures.\nFloating eyes swam in schools of over a dozen or fewer members. At birth they abandoned their young.\nFloating eyes were a carnivorous species of fish. They primarily fed upon small species that they would hypnotize, having a preference for brine and plankton. Though they would also feast upon the scraps left by other predatory species eating the creatures they paralyzed. If particularly lacking in food, they would resort to eating their young.\nThese creatures could be found in a wide variety of saltwater oceans.\nOn Toril, floating eyes were primarily known to be found in the waters around Ravens Bluff.\nMany aquatic predatory species lived in a symbiotic relationship with floating eyes &mdash such as manta rays, piranhas, and sharks &mdash traveling with their schools and feasting upon the creatures they paralyzed.\nSome adventurers were known to have tried capturing floating eyes to use them for their paralyzing ability. There was no known usage for their eyes, though many alchemists still sought them out in hopes of discovering one."
