Siege golems were a type of golem designed for siege warfare. Their primary means of attack was to fire boulders using their built-in catapults.
Siege golems were originally developed by the Red Wizards of Thay. The organization had sold a few of these constructs to customers including Cormyr and Zhentil Keep.
