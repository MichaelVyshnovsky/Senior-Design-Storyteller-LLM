'''Bream''' was a common species of [[panfish]] that inhabited several regions on both salt and freshwater bodies of water, including the [[Lake Glorfindar]] in the [[Starmetal Hills]] and remained active through the winter months under the lake's ice.

==Description==
Brown bream was a cold climate freshwater species of bream. They were small and flat bony brown animals with delicious flesh.

==Ecology==
They were edible and were a part of a winter's hero's feasts served during the annual [[Simril]] celebration in [[Twilight Tor]]. The feast also consisted of cooked [[brown bream]], [[blackjaw]], and [[candlefish]].

Bream meat was mashed with [[flour]] and shaped into "bream balls" â€“ a quality bait used by icefishers of Twilight Tor.
