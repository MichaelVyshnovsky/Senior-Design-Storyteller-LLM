The bloatfish was a species of fish found in the Great Glacier.
The bloatfish resembled a white manta ray, featuring an inflated organ that protruded from its belly like a balloon. This organs diameter matched or slightly exceeded the fishs length.
The bloatfish displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.
The balloon organ of the bloatfish remained filled with fresh water due to the fishs distinctive body chemistry. On rare occasions, fortunate fishermen managed to capture a bloatfish. They may choose to keep the frozen carcass with them, allowing them to enjoy sips of the organs fresh water by puncturing a hole in the fishs side. Once the balloon organ was depleted, the fish could be savored as a satisfying meal.
Bloatfish were scavengers. They consumed plankton, organic waste and any organic material.
The bloatfish inhabited the rivers and seas of the Great Glacier. Bloatfish were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands.
