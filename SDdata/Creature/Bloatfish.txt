The '''bloatfish''' was a species of [[fish]] found in the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
The bloatfish resembled a white [[manta ray]], featuring an inflated organ that protruded from its belly like a balloon. This organ's diameter matched or slightly exceeded the fish's length.

==Behavior==
The bloatfish displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.

==Ecology==
The balloon organ of the bloatfish remained filled with fresh water due to the fish's distinctive body chemistry. On rare occasions, fortunate fishermen managed to capture a bloatfish. They may choose to keep the frozen carcass with them, allowing them to enjoy sips of the organ's fresh water by puncturing a hole in the fish's side. Once the balloon organ was depleted, the fish could be savored as a satisfying meal.

Bloatfish were scavengers. They consumed plankton, organic waste and any organic material.

===Habitat===
The bloatfish inhabited the rivers and seas of the [[Great Glacier]]. Bloatfish were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands.
