'''Smoke mephits''' were [[mephit]]s composed of [[air]] and [[fire]]. They were crude and lazy, as well as liars and tricksters who thrived on mockery and misdirection.

==Combat==
Smoke mephits had sharp claws, which they used to attack their enemies.

===Physical Abilities===
Smoke mephits could fly as fast as they could move on land. They had a complete immunity against fire and poison.

They had an ability called ''cinder breath'', which consisted of smoldering ash, that blinded those caught in it.

When a smoke mephit died, a cloud of smoke with a radius of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} appeared. This cloud obscured the vision of other creatures.

===Magical Abilities===
Smoke mephits could cast ''[[dancing lights]]'' once per day.

Smoke mephits could summon one to four other smoke mephits once per day. These smoke mephits appeared within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} and disappeared after 1 minute, when the summoning smoke mephit died, or when the summoner released it. This ability worked only once every four times.

==Society==
Smoke mephits were servants of [[Vhaeraun]], the [[drow]] god of thievery, and were sent by him to [[Toril]].

==Notable Smoke mephits==
* [[Ehkahk]], self-proclaimed ruler of the [[Paraelemental Plane of Smoke]].
