        "Description": "Moon dogs resembled large dogs, about {{SI|3|ft}} tall at the shoulder, with silvery fur and obsidian-black eyes. Moon dogs had opposable digits on their front paws, allowing them to use those paws as hands. Additionally, the face had some slight human characteristics.",
        "Personality": "Moon dogs were relentless hunters of evil. Because of this, they rarely associated with anyone for long. They were generally friendly to other good creatures.",
        "Abilities": "Moon dogs spoke the languages of [[Celestial language|celestials]] and [[Infernal language|devils]], as well as [[Common]]. They could also use telepathy to communicate with creatures within 50 feet of them.\n\nMoon dogs possessed a wide variety of abilities, including a number of magical powers. Among them, they could always [[detect evil]], [[detect magic|magic]], [[Detect snares and pits|traps]], and [[See invisibility|invisibility]]. By licking a wound, they could [[Delay poison|slow poison]], [[remove disease]], or even [[Cure minor wounds|completely heal a minor one]].\n\nMoon dogs could dispel illusions by whining. By barking, a moon dog could [[dispel evil]]. When one bayed, it instilled [[fear]] in all evil creatures within 80 feet of it. And when a moon dog howled, all evil creatures within {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} of it were damaged and possibly [[dismissal|dismissed]]. The more moon dogs that were howling, the harder it was to resist the dismissal effect.",
        "Notable Moon Dogs": "* [[Cooteu]], leader of the [[Moonshadow Pack]] of [[wolf|wolves]] near [[Shadowdale]].\n* [[Lunapine]], companion of [[Naneatha Suaril]], high priestess of [[Sel√ªne]] at the [[House of the Moon]] temple in [[Waterdeep]]"
