'''Fire giants''', called '''''ildjotunen''''' in their own language, were master craftsmen [[giant]]s that lived in volcanic and mountainous environments.

{{Quote
|If you want forge work fit for a king, you have two options: dwarves and fire giants. If you don't want to be forced to slave in the mines until you're tossed in the coals, you have really only one option.

==Description==
Fire giants had very broad bodies, making them sort of [[dwarf]]-like in appearance, and bulky. but they weighed over {{SI|7000|lb|k|long=yes}}, much heavier than a [[human]] of that height would weigh.{{Giant vitals/Fire giant}} Their skin was very dark, reminiscent of coal, and the color of their hair tended towards a spectrum of flaming orange or red, with similarly colored red eyes.

Their clothing was usually flame-colored or black and singed. They also tended to wear armor that was forged from [[steel]] or dragonscales.

==Personality==
Fire giants often considered bravery as being one of the highest virtues anyone could and should have. They relished opportunities in which they could test their fortitude against formidable opponents.

==Abilities==
Much like all giants, a fire giant could see and hear twice as far as the average [[human]]. Unique to their race were senses well adapted to high temperature environments. Their eyes in particular were capable of seeing through the hazes and shimmers often associated with such temperatures.

Although their bodies were impervious to harm from [[fire]], even that exhaled by a [[red dragon]], some fire giants were particularly vulnerable to cold.

===Magic===
Fire giants possessed an average affinity for [[runecaster|runecasting]] as well as traditional [[sorcery]]. This affinity was superior to many of their kin, but paled in comparison to that of [[cloud giant|cloud]] and [[storm giant]]s. They typically preferred to memorize [[spell]]s that would help them in detecting and thwarting intruders.

==Combat==
Fire giants were known to attack their enemies with rocks heated in fire or lava, thereby softening the targets before engaging in close quarters combat. When it came to close quarters, fire giants favored the use of large swords, typically [[item enchantment|enchanted]] with flames.

Having had [[caltrop]]s used against them one too many times, innovative fire giants developed [[boots]] made of either [[iron]] or dragonskin to protect their feet. These were typically covered in either fur or leather in order to conceal the material from any crafty magic user that might think to use spells of cold or heat. It was rumored that some giants had become specialists in fighting with these boots.{{Cite dragon/254/...The Harder They Fall}}

==History==
The fire giant race began with an individual by the name of [[Masud]], one of the mortal children of [[Annam All-Father]] and [[Othea]], who in the kingdom of [[Ostoria]] was ceded control of the southern volcanoes.{{cite book/Giantcraft|7}} They managed to tame such chaotic environs, building cities of [[adamantine]] and [[mithral]]. Within this mighty kingdom they acted as its craftsmen, engineers, and military officers.

==Society==
Fire giants lived in small family groups, called ''huslyder''.
===Habitats===
They preferred to dwell in hot environments like volcanic areas, either in caverns or castles, and existed in societies often led by a king or a queen.
===Languages===
Fire giants were known to speak the general giant language [[Jotun]], their own specialized version of it known as ''[[Jotunild]]'', as well as [[common]].
====Names====
Common given names among fire giants included the following:{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1298284496903704576| title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 25-08-2020| date = 25-08-2020}}

;Males: Fforl, Ffuldr, Fulluk, Hauk, Hulbro, Ilkurt, Snarr, Zund, and Zundr.
;Females: Edrelle, Emba, Ffaelane, Ghenjra, Hulda, Lukue, Marra, and Vrolka.

===Religion===
Like all giants, they were generally known to worship [[Annam All-Father]] and those that did viewed their lives as being one long opportunity to emulate him. However, by the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]] their views regarding Annam turned sour and very few directly worshiped him anymore. The deity primarily worshiped by fire giants, especially after the late 15{{th}} century, was Annam's son [[Surtur]]. Though some were also known to worship the giant goddess [[Hiatea]].{{cite book/Giantcraft|49}} 

Beyond the [[giant pantheon]], many were known to worship to a lesser extent [[elemental fire]], and by extension [[Kossuth]], which they would show their devotion to by ritually performing complex and intricate dances along the edges of vast firepits and streams of lava. Tribes would sometimes invite visitors to join them in their dance, but the steam and heat involved often led other races to hallucinate and experience effects similar to that of the [[spell]] ''[[phantasmal killer]]''.

[[Priest]]s often held a role of leadership in fire giant communities, positions such as architect of forger. If such a position was not held then they were typically charged with making sure others in their tribe remained productive. This was largely achieved by composing inspiring tales that lauded the features of [[Gudheim]], the crystal palace of Annam.

===Relationships===
Many fire giants, at least in the [[Ice Spires]] region, were known to enslave [[fomorian]]s and [[verbeeg]]s, as well as occasionally [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s. Slaves held the lowest role in their societal structures and were often treated with little dignity. They typically worked as laborers in their forges and strongholds.

Fire Giants were often hostage takers and took payments from less powerful creatures in their surrounding area in exchange for not attacking them.

They were known to occasionally forge alliances with, and even serve, red dragons. They were also known to domesticate [[hell hound]]s, keeping them as pets or guards.

==Notable Fire Giants==
* [[Gommoth]], a cult leader who was shunned by his fellow giants for being so minuscule.
* [[Orn]], a smith who wanted to create the greatest dragon-slaying weapon in history in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Zalto]], the lord of the fire giants during the time of the ordning shattering.
