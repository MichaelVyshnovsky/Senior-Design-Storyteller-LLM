        "mainbody": "'''Pyroclastic dragons''' were [[true dragon]]s from [[Gehenna]], [[Dragon Eyrie]], and [[Fury's Heart]], as well as the far reaches of the [[Elemental Chaos]].",
        "Description": "A pyroclastic dragon's body was shaped like a [[red dragon]]'s,\n\nAll in all, a pyroclastic dragon's body gave off a sense of immovability. Compared its body, its wings, which were seemingly made of ash, were rather weak-looking but fully operational.",
        "Personality": "A pyroclastic dragon was an avid swimmer. What was special about this was that it liked to swim through magma instead of water. They were creatures whose temperament was compared to a volcano. Overstressing it caused a truly violent reaction. They loved to eat meat but a diet of minerals sufficed.",
        "Combat": "A pyroclastic dragon could walk twice as fast as a [[human]]. It was a rather slow flier for a [[dragon]]. It could burrow through the earth. Most important about its abilities for locomotion was its natural climbing ability,\n\nApart from the abilities it shared with other true planar dragons, a pyroclastic dragon was completely immune to fire and damage from sound. With advancing age, it gained an ever stronger defense in the form of harder scales, resistance against magic, non-magical attacks and those attacks that were not aligned with the philosophy of good.\n\nIt had two breath weapons. One was superheated ash that was delivered on a wave of sonic force. Both were harmful to creatures. The former burned creatures, the latter crushed them. The second breath weapon worked like a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell; creatures who could not withstand it crumbled to ash.\n\nLike any other planar dragon, a pyroclastic dragon had no sorcerous powers. However, it gained a number of inherent spells with advancing age. It learned to cast ''[[produce flame]]'' and ''[[sound burst]]'', both of which it could cast up to three times per day, and ''[[fire storm]]'', ''[[incendiary cloud]]'', ''[[meteor swarm]]'', ''[[power word, stun]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[shatter]]'', ''[[shout]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', and ''[[wall of stone]]''.",
        "Society": "A pyroclastic dragon of any age could be encountered alone, but there were two exceptions. Wyrmling to young adult ones gathered in clutches of two to five. A pair of mature adults could form a family consisting of the pair and a clutch.\n\nPyroclastic dragons preferred to make their lairs in the calderas of active volcanoes."
