It had a single horn above its snout and several grew from the top of its large, bony head crest. \nStyracosaurs were known for being aggressive.\nStyracosaurs used their crest spikes against any large predator who tried to bite their vulnerable hind quarters. Against smaller predators, styracosaurs charged towards them, using their great size and weight to crush them.\nStyracosaurs were herbivores and lived in herds."
