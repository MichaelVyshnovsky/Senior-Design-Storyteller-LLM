        "mainbody": "'''Marids''' ({{Pronounce|ma|RIDZ|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}, sometimes pluralized as \"marid\") were powerful [[genie]]s native to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].\n\nMost [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] revered marids as the most wondrous and powerful of all geniekind.",
        "Description": "The average marid stood a towering sixteen to eighteen feet (five and a half meters) tall, looking down upon all other genies. Marids were beautiful genies whose skin matched all of the hues of the vast ocean. While usually blue, in fact, marids changed their skin color to reflect their current mood, with darkest shades of blue indicating anger. Most marids had blue-black or dark gray hair, though white-haired marids did exist. Generally speaking, the white-haired marids were the most turbulent of their kind.\n\nWhile on the Elemental Plane of Water, or in seas or oceans, marids usually wore scant clothing or went bare. On land they preferred colorful flowing robes or large pantaloons. Others would wear clothing made from finely woven seaweed inlaid with coral or pearls. Both males and females enjoyed showing off their impressive physiques, so flimsy vests were usually the most clothing they wore to cover their torsos. Regardless of the style of clothing worn, it was certain to never impede swimming.",
        "Abilities": "Marids could communicate with telepathy like all true genies. They spoke [[Aquan]], the language of their native plane, but they were also fluent in [[Jannti]], the common tongue of all genies, and [[Midani]], the native language of Zakhara. When angered, a marid's native language resembled the sound of a clashing storm at sea or waves crashing against a rocky shore.\n[[File:Marid.PNG|thumb|left|250px|''A beautiful and powerful marid.'']]\nBesides immense physical strength&mdash;they could stop a ship as long as 110 feet (34 meters) in length&mdash;marids were wondrously magical creatures, matching archwizards in terms of spellcasting ability. They could use the following spell-like abilities whenever they wanted to: ''[[create water]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[see invisibility|detect invisible]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', and ''[[Purify food and drink|purify water]]''. They had more limited powers to [[assume liquid form]], by taking the form of a vortex, or to [[Gaseous form|assume gaseous form]]. They could create a [[Solid fog|wall of fog]], and were said to be able to [[lower water]] and [[part water]]. Once every year they could [[limited wish|alter reality]] but only as a gift to non-genies.\n\nAny water-based magic was utterly useless against a marid. Some scholars believed that they were also partially resistant to cold-based spells, yet fire-based magic was their weakness, being particularly vulnerable to attacks with open flames. Others, on the contrary, had observed no such weaknesses to fire. In fact, a marid's very touch was said to extinguish any flame. Instead, they argued that marids were strongly resistant to magic of any variety.\n[[File:Marid1eB.png|thumb|right|250px|''A marid appearing from beneath the waves.'']]\nMarids could travel between any of the [[elemental planes|Elemental]], [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]] and [[Astral Plane|Astral]] planes at will, though not to a specific location, and could carry others along with them. They could also move freely upon the [[Ethereal Plane]]. Due to their strained relationships with the other genies, they rarely visited the other Elemental planes.",
        "Personality": "Marids were a vehemently independent and proud people. Every marid believed that she or he deserved to be the padishah. They tended to shift moods rapidly, as quickly as a storm upon the sea. Like all genies, they were curious about life on the Material Plane, but they typically had the least impact on that plane of all the other genies, because they considered everyone else beneath their notice.\n\nMarids enjoyed flattery even more than other genies. When addressing a marid, a [[human]] was expected to use a honorific, such as \"Endless Wave Upon the Sea of Fate,\" followed by a long and wordy ode to the marid's greatness. Because of their chaotic nature, marids were considered dangerous to imprison or bind or to demand wishes from. They were quick to seek revenge for any slight. \n\n[[Image:Marid3.PNG|thumb|left|250px|''Caught! A marid snares another collectible item.'']]\nMarids enjoyed hunting within the oceans for sport. Because of their elevated self-worth, all marids collected wealth in many forms, even if they were not actual nobles. These collected items were often pearls or other treasures from the sea floor, but some even kidnapped skilled [[human]] or [[demihuman]] craftsmen so they could work on their homes or produce artistic creations. These kidnappings did violate marid law, so they kept their \"borrowed\" workers a secret to avoid the wrath of the true [[noble marid]]s. More malicious marids would intentionally capsize vessels on the Material Plane to drown sailors. \n\nMarids treated all other races, including other genies, as inferiors. They tolerated the [[djinn]] and [[jann]] but openly despised the [[dao]] and [[efreet]]. Humans as a species were tolerated as well, but were considered the most disgusting species with whom the marids had dealings. Powerful human [[sha'ir]]s and leaders like the [[Grand Caliph]] could gain the respect of the marids only if it was well deserved. Even so, a marid was far more likely to treat a human visitor to the Plane of Water favorably than most other [[elemental]]s or [[outsider]]s would.\n\nWhile not generally altruistic, they loathed evil creatures of the Plane of Water and often waged war against them. Though they were the most powerful of all genies, their hesitancy to rally under a single leader limited their effectiveness at such wars.",
        "Ecology": "These mighty genies were sea creatures, but could breathe on land with ease. Their bodies were formed from [[Water|elemental water]].\n\nMarids did not need to consume food or beverages in order to survive, though many did so because it pleased them. Some marids built fishing outposts near seaweed and coral balls, which floated through the Plane of Water, because the balls attracted many fish varieties. They were quite sensitive to flavors. Many kept censers within their homes to release exotic salts, infusing the water with pleasing flavors.",
        "Habitat/Society": {
            "Religion": "Marids were not a very religious people. Among the gods they sometimes worshiped were [[Ahto]], [[Blibdoolpoolp]], [[Jisan]], [[Manankharlar]], and [[Tefnut]].",
            "Combat": "Like most genies, marids saw battle as a puzzle to solve and enjoyed using their powerful abilities to take advantage of their foes' weaknesses. Naturally, they strongly preferred to battle underwater. When in water, a single marid could easily capsize a ship and create a vortex to entrap any foe trying to swim to safety.\n\nA typical war party included a single noble marid and as many as 50 common marid warriors, perhaps accompanied by a dozen other creatures from the Plane of Water.\n\nMarids sometimes warred against other genies just to remind them of their power."

        "Notable Marids": "* [[Ajhuu]], the founder of the [[Ajhuutal]], who was originally allied with the [[noble djinni]] [[Calim]] before turning against the [[Calim Empire]]\n* [[Haj]] and [[Luar]], two marids for whom the [[Azure Falls]] received their name\n* [[Jiraad]], Advisor to the [[Grand Caliph]]\n* [[Bitrabi]], guardian of the waters of [[Cursrah]]\n* [[Shanzezim]], who was bound by the [[Waterclock Guild]] and ordered to fix the guild's clocks. It was later abandoned to its own at the [[Waterclock Guild's Crypts]]."
