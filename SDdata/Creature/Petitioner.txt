'''Petitioner''' was the term applied to a dead person's soul that made it in some way or another to a plane of existence  other than the [[Material Plane]].

{{Quote|''Petitioners don't care about whether they are killed in the name of the [[Blood War]] or in the name of justice. They're just deaders.''|The Declaration of the Ring-Givers<ref>}}

==Becoming a petitioner==
{{Quote|''I don't see it as death so much as a chance for a new life.''|Aroukis, a petitioner of [[Apollo]] sharing their view on being a petitioner.}}

Upon dying, a mortal's soul was transported to the [[Fugue Plane]]. Once there, these souls counted as petitioners but didn't have the attributes of one yet. They became full petitioners after entering the plane of their respective deities.

Other petitioners received judgement from [[Kelemvor]], the assigned arbiter of the placement of the dead. The standards by which such judgements were determined were based on whether or not a mortal followed a deity, which deity they chose, and how honestly they lived according to its ideals during their lifetime. 

==Normal Petitioners==
Normally, the soul of a dead mortal went to the Fugue Plane. Once there, it waited until the deity it followed during its lifetime, or an agent of the same, came and took it to its final destination, that is, the [[divine realm]] of the deity. Souls could not be deceived in any way into following agents of a god not their own, instantly recognizing those of their deity and innately knowing they were supposed to follow them, not that divine agents were capable of taking souls that didn't belong to them.

===Attributes===
Once in their deity's realm, a petitioner became a full petitioner with all the attributes of such.<ref>

Some petitioners were remodeled upon entering the realm of their deity. For example, followers of an [[Seldarine|elven deity]] took on the form of handsome elves with exaggerated, [[fey]]-seeming features, even if they weren't elves in life. A similar thing occurs with petitioners of the [[Morndinsamman|dwarven deities]], appearing as sturdy dwarves.<ref> Barring resurrection, a petitioner could not leave the realm of their deity, though allied deities allowed their petitioners to mingle with loved ones who served another deity. While most resurrected petitioners didn't usually retain their memories of their time being dead, [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]] retained vague memories.

===Duties===
As mentioned above, a petitioner served their deity in varying capacities, based on the nature of the deity. Some had a more relaxed [[afterlife]], while others were called upon to defend the realm. Petitioner pursuits could also be similar to those it had in life. For example, petitioners of [[Oghma]] would pursue knowledge in the vast libraries of the Hall of Knowledge, petitioners of [[Tempus]] engaged in battle, and those of [[Arvandor]] spent their days feasting on its bounty and communing with its nature.

==Unclaimed Petitioners==
If a petitioner did not have a specific patron deity in life (most mortals were polytheistic), they were taken in by the one they gravitated to the most.{{Cite web

}} Any form of worship, whether a prayer or curse made in a time of strife, was a sufficient basis for a god to do so. Even if active interest in the divine had never been expressed throughout life, a patron deity could be chosen at the moment of one's death.

There were few beings, mortal or immortal, who wished for a soul to go unclaimed. The gods greatly desired mortal souls, [[Lurue]] the [[Unicorn]] Queen for example tried to find the souls of those who died alone in forests and other wild places, attempting to take them to her realm if no one else would.{{Cite web

}} Deities of the dead would even try to claim souls by conducting certain funerary rites.

Standards were known to be particularly low in regards to infants and children. If they noticed or were infatuated with one deity, whether by an associated symbol, image, item, ritual, priest or actual manifestations more than any other, that deity received their soul. This also occurred in cases where they were consecrated to a deity and favored no other more.

Even so, the gods ''did'' have standards for which souls they would claim, and those deemed unworthy by whatever standard they applied would not be collected.

===Faithless===
{{Main|Faithless}}
The label of "Faithless" referred to the soul of a deceased individual who had no patron deity. This meant that the soul in question lacked any true personal attachment to any deity, which could be for different reasons. For example, only paying lip service to one without ever truly believing would constitute faithless behavior, as would rejecting all gods as unworthy as worship.

This could also mean that the soul in question never believed that deities existed during their lifetime, having firmly denied their existence, though this was exceedingly rare given that deities were very active forces on Toril.{{Cite web

}}

Some [[wizard]]s and sages did not venerate [[Mystra]] as such, but rather worshiped the [[Weave]] itself, and it could be argued that [[Siamorphe]]'s faith was non-theistic. There existed cults to monsters such as [[beholder]]s, [[lich]]es who worshiped older, more famous liches as role models, and religions which venerated [[magic item]]s. while the cult of [[The Balance|the Cosmic Balance]] worshiped the concept rather than a specific god.

Someone who dedicated their lives to a certain way of living without specifically worshiping or spurning gods had a chance of being picked up by an appropriate deity. Rather than those who followed no gods, and unless otherwise taken, it was for them that Kelemvor reserved his most infamous punishment.

All Faithless souls received the same sentence from Kelemvor;The novel ''[[Crucible: The Trial of Cyric the Mad]]'' states that Kelemvor replaced the Wall of the Faithless with a mirrored wall that showed the false and the faithless their reflections in such a way as to reveal the follies and life choices that led them to be sent to his realm. However, the more recent ''[[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]'' sourcebook still describes faithless souls being mortared into the Wall for eternity. As of its November 2020 errata, the ''Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide'' no longer mentions the Wall of the Faithless, but the status of the Wall is now unknown. Only divine intervention (such as through a ''[[miracle]]'' or ''[[wish]]'' spell symbolizing such) could save the soul at that point.

===False===
{{Main|False}}
The label of "False" referred to the soul of a deceased individual who intentionally turned from a faith they believed in. This did not mean that all who had a change of heart were branded as false, but to actively change religions haphazardly or quickly was likely to garner one a reputation for weakness of faith and risk the label. Like souls without a particular ethos, those who somehow transgressed in the eyes of their favored deity would need to wait for a deity to take them or for the potential centuries it might take for Kelemvor to determine where they would be placed.

False souls were judged and punished for all eternity to a life in Kelemvor's packed metropolis according to their deeds in life. The punishment was enacted by Kelemvor and [[Jergal]] and it always included an assignment as the eternal labor force in the [[City of Judgement]], but the content was determined by the deity the petitioner swayed from and depended on the severity of the offenses.

In some cases these were relatively light sentences, such as patrolling the city for unauthorized guests, escorting visiting baatezu or other lost souls, and caring for those they disliked. In others they were tormented in ways even the cruelest demon would be surprised by and which would kill a living mortal. As part of his agreement with the devils, Kelemvor allowed a few groups of baatezu to ocassionally torment the city's citizens. The truly False souls were punished the same as the truly Faithless, with eternal condemnation to the Wall of the Faithless.

Like the Faithless, the False were also capable of leaving the Fugue Plane, at least in theory. While technically sent to be punished "forever", it would be more accurate to say "indefinitely". In very rare cases, the sentence lasted until a deity sent servitors to "harvest them for a new life", giving the soul another chance. Only Kelemvor could grant the False respite and he was not known to change his mind on his sentences, but even he, for reasons unknown, sometimes removed souls from their usual fates to act in his service, reincarnating them in the mortal world.

===Fiends===
;Devils:
[[File:Soulshells.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A mob of soul shells.'']]
Small enclaves of [[baatezu]] [[devil]]s existed on the Fugue plane and were allowed, by contract with Kelemvor, to negotiate with souls while they were there. While not permitted to hurt or trick them (normally), they could explain the situation they were in and bargain with them. The baatezu sought souls that could be used to create [[lemure]]s, the lowest devils, and generally only particularly wicked mortals could be subject to the transformation.

While not the most appealing of offers, souls who for whatever reason feared for their future in the hands of their own vile deities might be tempted to consign themselves to the [[Nine Hells]]. Early or automatic promotions could be haggled for depending on the power of the soul and outcome of its bargain, as could other benefits like the performance of devilish services against still-living enemies or 
even aid for friends and family. The conversion rate was low for the baatezu, but enough souls died across Faerun that making the offers was still worth it,

Before transformation the average hellish petitioner, sometimes called a "soul shell", were ghost-white shades, although not insubstantial wisps. They were (as much as other petitioners) beings of flesh and bone, and in fact slightly rubbery. The term referred to the fact that they were mere shells of their former selves, disheveled, terrified and as wounded as they were in life. After the paperwork was done, a program of torture was enacted to strip away their humanity and individuality and drain them of [[divine]] magical energy before what was left of the quivering husk was dumped in a putrid processing chamber and reborn as a lemure.

;Demons:
While the lawful baatezu devils had an agreement with Kelemvor allowing portals to the Nine Hells to open his plane, the chaotic [[tanar'ri]] [[demon]]s had no such arrangements, obtaining souls their own way. On occassion, a demon lord made a portal to the Fugue Plane from the [[Abyss]], whereupon servitor demons attacked the Wall of the Faithless and raided the City of Judgement. The doomed souls ripped from the Wall and kidnapped denizens of the city

Kelemvor would tolerate these attacks up to a point, generally just defending his realm through his servants, those of Jergal, and the baatezu who were always ready to battle their ancient foe. However, if attacks became too frequent, caused too much collateral damage, the demons became too greedy in their theft, some of his or Jergal's divine agents were taken, or he simply felt the need to teach the demons a lesson, he would either step up the defenses of the realm or perform a counterstrike. He preferred raiding sorties and campaigns made to make the rulers of the Abyss seem incompetent, harrassing as many of the demons as was possible. Even so, these attacks were just to keep the number of attacks on his city low and were rarely needed. 

Ironcially, being stolen by demons could end up in the salvation of such a soul, for if any deity became interested in such a figure they might send servitors to wrest the freed soul from their kidnapper before giving it new life and watching to see what they did next. This often happened to souls of those known for being innovative, creative, or daring.

;Larva:
Malicious mortals spirits that came to the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]] or the [[Blood Rift]] were reborn as soul [[larva]], the currency of the [[fiendish planes]] who could be used to create other types of fiends, including lemures or [[dretch]]es. Kelemvor might see fit to impose this form on an unclaimed soul before casting the squirming worm into the dust.

==Unusual Petitioners==
Worshipers of the gods [[Tyr]], [[Torm]], and [[Ilmater]] became [[lantern archon]]s when they died.

Petitioners of [[Brightwater]] became creatures highly similar, if not identical to, [[bacchae]], revelers caught between human and bestial natures.

A [[vhaerath]] was a special type of petitioner who followed [[Vhaeraun]].{{Cite web/Obsul Ssussun, "The Door to Light"}}

Petitioners of [[Auril]] and [[Talos]] took on almost [[elemental]] forms, appearing as cold spirits for the former and sentient lightning for the latter.

}} although there were many [[guardinal]] [[Celestial paragon|paragons]] in the [[House of Nature]] that acted as the patron of different creatures. Certain deities were also known to gather animal souls to act as willing and brief messengers or helpers before their spirits moved on. These included but were not necessarily limited to: [[Silvanus]], [[Chauntea]], [[Mielikki]], and [[Eldath]] of the [[House of Nature]]; [[Sheela Peryroyl]] of the [[Green Fields]]; and [[Malar]] of [[Fury's Heart]]. Pets and [[familiar]]s were exceptions to this rule, and either went with with their bonded partner's soul or to whatever plane best suited their attitudes and the qualities they gained or improved while in service.

The souls of certain planes and gods were known to take on the forms of [[animal]]s. Petitioners of the House of Nature initially appeared as they did as mortals, but over the course of centuries gradually took on more bestial features until they became [[Celestial creature]]s. Malar, and to a lesser extent [[Umberlee]], transformed their petitioners into particularly fierce and primal versions of normal animals. Like the fiends, Malar also stole souls from the Fugue Plane before forcing them into innocuous animal forms for his own petitioners to hunt.

===Unusual Attributes===
Some types of petitioners possessed abilities unusual for their kind.

Certain types of petitioners were able to leave their home plane. These included those that became members of [[outsider]] races, such as lantern archons, larva, lemures, and manes, and others like the vhaerath, who could leave Vhaeraun's realm of [[Ellaniath]].

Certain types of petitioners retained the abilities they possessed in life, although not necessarily the context for how they had them. These included petitioners from the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]] and the vhaerath.
