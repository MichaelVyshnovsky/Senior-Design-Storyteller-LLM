        "mainbody": "Hextons were the fifth rank of hierarch modrons.\nHextons were shaped like humanoids with long arms and six-fingered hands, as well as four tentacles that ended in sharp claws. They also possessed fan-like wings.\nIf forced into combat, a hexton used a combination of innate abilities, spells, fists and their sharp claws.\nLike all hierarch modrons, hextons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience, clairvoyance, command, dimension door, teleport without error, and wall of force spells at will. Hextons were able to cast arcane spells as well as divine spells from the Law, Protection and War domains. Hextons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.\nThere were only 36 hextons in modron society. They could communicate with other hextons and with quintons, and relayed their orders to septons. Hextons were the generals of the 36 modron armies. Two of these armies served the secundi, three served the tertians, sixteen were associated with each of the sixteen regions of Mechanus, and the rest were at the direct disposal of Primus. Hextons could communicate telepathically with anyone in a 216-mile (348 km) radius.\nHextons were always created as the result of septons being upgraded to take the place of a destroyed hexton, or in case a vacancy appeared due to a hexton being promoted to the rank of quinton.\nHextons were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within  and could see in darkvision up to .\nAn unidentified rogue hexton owned a shop in Sigil where it constructed steel predators for hire as assassins."
