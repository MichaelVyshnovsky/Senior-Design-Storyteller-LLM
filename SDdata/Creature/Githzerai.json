The githzerai are a walking contradiction in terms.}}",
        "mainbody": "thzerai society was monastic and introspective. Many githzerai trained as monks, while others chose to lose their natural magic resistance and become [[wizard]]s. Some multi-talented githzerai became [[zerth]]s, blending magic, combat, and psionics into their fighting. The zerths also held special significance as religious leaders in githzerai society. Like their cousins and enemies, the [[githyanki]], githzerai often formed hunting bands for the purpose of seeking out and destroying the hated [[illithid]]s.\n\nThey were fiercely loyal to their leader [[Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith]], who remained alive centuries after he had led the surviving githzerai to [[Limbo]] following the battle between [[Gith]] and [[Zerthimon]]. Despite their strong sense of loyalty, the githzerai also placed immense value on their personal freedom.\n\n[[File:Githzerai_anarch-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|''A githzerai anarch.'']]\nThe githzerai dwelt mostly in the chaos of Limbo. Those fortresses, and the ones established outside of Limbo, were maintained by extremely powerful githzerai known as [[anarch]]s, who were capable of mentally manipulating the raw stuff of Limbo into whatever form and landscape they desired. This power extended for a distance of up to {{SI|5|mi|k|long=yes}} from the anarch.\n\nGithzerai presence in Limbo was not confined to fortresses, but also included cities. Although city inhabitants did not follow the strict martial discipline enforced in monasteries, they revered and respected the martial discipline of their brethren. Their largest city there was called [[Shra'kt'lor]], an austere fortress-city that served as both the capital of the githzerai civilization and its military headquarters. Shra'kt'lor's fortifications were coordinated by Menyar-Ag himself, who dwelt in the center of the city and was considered akin to a [[deity]].\n\nThe githzerai kept several outposts in the [[Underdark]], in particular in the region of [[Old Shanatar]], from where they observed githyanki and mind flayer activity. One particularly large fortress was the secret hold of [[Karokrath]], from which they observed activities in [[Oryndoll]] and in the githyanki enclave of [[Gatchorof]].\n\n[[File:Githzerai_limbo_fortress-5e.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''A githzerai fortress city in Limbo.'']]\nThere were also a number of githzerai settlements located in the [[Elemental Chaos]], according to the [[World Axis cosmology]]. The largest such city/monastery was called [[Zerthadlun|Zerth'Ad'lun]], an oasis of peace among the plane's chaos. The city consisted of an enormous spherical arrangement of stone spires that made use of the subjective gravity of the plane to create a complex and nontrivial internal architecture. The monastery's headmaster, Sensei [[Bertholomais]], taught a martial art called ''zerthi'', which granted its practitioners the ability to briefly [[glimpse]] into the future during a battle. The teachings were open to non-githzerai as well. Practitioners of ''zerthi'' were known as [[cenobite]]s.\n\nThey also kept a strong fortress and numerous monasteries in [[Warrior's Rest]], where they improved their battle strategies.{{Cite dragon/378/Playing Githzerai|81}}\n\nIn an effort to replicate the bond between the githyanki and [[red dragon]]s, a group of githzerai once attempted to forge a similar alliance with [[chaos dragon]]s. The effort was largely a failure due to the chaos dragons' unpredictability and disloyalty. However, some successful exceptions existed and, in rare cases, collaborations between chaos dragons and githzerai could be found.\n\n===Language===\nThe githzerai spoke their own dialect of the [[Gith language]], which used a unique form of writing called [[tir'su]]. It was an alphabetical set of runes in which words were formed in circles instead of linearly, with the letters of a given word being linked in a ring counter-clockwise from the bottom. Sentences were formed by a series of these rings.",
        "Description": "Like all [[Gith (race)|gith]], githzerai were tall and emaciated-looking humanoids, but, thanks to their rigid training, had more muscular bodies. They had pale yellow skin, sometimes with greenish or brownish tones. Their skulls were long and angular, with deep-set eyes, flattened noses, and long pointed ears. Typical hair colors included black, russet, and sometimes gray, which male githzerai either shaved or wore in braids. Their facial hair was also carefully groomed. Female githzerai usually wore their hair in buns or braids.\n\nAs a result of their long period of enslavement and manipulation by the mind flayers, all githzerai possessed [[psionic]] abilities. They were all capable of minor telekinesis in a similar fashion to the ''[[mage hand]]'' [[spell]] and could also hone their abilities to become capable of innately casting ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' and ''[[detect thoughts]]''.\n\nAn austere and frugal people, githzerai usually favored practical and unadorned clothing, with at most some simple jewelry.",
        "Personality": "{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 250px\n| source = [[Marivus Quince]]\n| text   = Githzerai come in two types: hardheaded, and stubborn.\n}}\nSince their hard-won victory against the mind flayers, followed by their dissent and defeat at the hands of the githyanki, the githzerai became ascetics and philosophers, pursuing self-knowledge in the face of adversity.{{Cite dragon/378/Playing Githzerai|80}} As a splinter group of an oppressed race, they were extremely distrustful of outsiders{{Cite dragon/378/Playing Githzerai|81}}\n\nAn intense and sometimes fanatical people, the githzerai kept the memory of their origins always alive and carried out all their affairs with a burning sense of righteousness.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Githzerai_enlightened-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A githzerai enlightened.'']]\nMany githzerai, following their monastic lifestyle, tended to train in martial combat and fought as [[monk]]s. Githzerai monks who most closely followed the teachings of Zerthimon were known as [[zerth]]s. Through intense training and meditation, zerths had access to many psionic powers, such as the ability to innately reproduce effects similar to the ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[phantasmal killer]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', and ''[[see invisibility]]'' spells. Particularly advanced zerths reached the rank of \"enlightened\", acquiring the ability to explore the nature of reality itself. Enlightened githzerai could use their psionic abilities to produce additional effects similar to ''[[blur]]'', ''[[expeditious retreat]]'', ''[[haste]]'', and ''[[teleport]]''.",

        "History": "[[File:Githzerai_vs_Blue_Slaad-3e.jpg|thumb|200px|''A githzerai fighting a [[blue slaad]].'']]\nThe githzerai descended from the same race as the githyanki, a race that some referred to as \"the forerunners\"{{Cite polyhedron/159/Incursion: Knights of the Lich-Queen|38-39}} located in an unknown [[crystal sphere]] that had been conquered by the illithids during the expansion of their empire, and who had been slowly altered by the mind flayers' genetic experiments,{{Cite polyhedron/159/Incursion: Knights of the Lich-Queen|6}} while others claimed that they might have been created by the illithids themselves through mixing humanoid hosts with powers from the [[Far Realm]].\n\nAfter centuries of servitude, the forerunners revolted under the guidance of their leader [[Gith]], winning their freedom and spreading unprecedented devastation through the illithid empire, bringing the mind flayers to the brink of extinction. Despite this, Gith ordered the continuation of the war effort until the last mind flayer was destroyed and the gith became masters of their own empire based on conquest. At this point, [[Zerthimon]], a gith who had gathered a significant following during the uprising, challenged Gith's leadership and her motives, arguing that she would end up leading the people into a similar tyranny that their former masters enforced.\n\nZerthimon maintained that the mind flayers had already been defeated beyond recovery and that it was time for the fighting to stop and for the newly freed gith to learn about themselves and to improve as a culture, strengthening their unity and wisdom as a people, not to start another cycle of violence.\n\n[[File:Menyar-ag-5e.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the Great Githzerai.'' ]]\nThe disagreement led to a violent civil war. Zerthimon was killed and his followers, who called themselves \"githzerai\" (meaning \"those who spurn Gith\" in the Gith language This struggle gave sufficient time for the surviving mind flayers to retreat and hide in well-defended underground locations.<ref group=\"note\"> The separation between the two races is referred to as the [[Pronouncement of Two Skies]] in ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a small group of githzerai zerths led by [[Yrlakka]], a member of the [[Sha'sal Khou]], dwelt in the 15{{th}} level of [[Undermountain]].",
