'''Mariliths''' ({{Pronounce|MAR|ruh|lithz|refs=}}), also known as '''type V''' [[demon]]s, They served as the brilliant tacticians of [[Abyss]]al hordes, advisors to demonic nobility, and in some cases acted as serpentine demon queens.

==Description==
From the waist up, mariliths appeared to be attractive [[humanoid]] women with six arms, but their lower halves were those of giant, green snakes. 

==Personality==

Mariliths had domineering and wicked personalities, They were highly intelligent beings with a good sense for strategy, their brilliance thriving in matters of army-level tactics. 

Mariliths also had the rare ability to unite and coordinate the actions of other demons, a practically impossible task due to their chaotic nature. Whether through disciplinary mastery or suppression of their natural instincts, they could predict the actions of law despite not truly understanding them in order to outwit the [[baatezu]]. 

In the eyes of most mariliths, subtle temptation was but a silly game compared to true warfare planning. They were proud of their martial skills and tactical superiority and often kept the weapons of their defeated foes as trophies. Their weapons were among their most cherished possessions, and if stolen they would take extreme measures to retrieve them.

==Abilities==
Mariliths could cast [[illusion]]ary and [[charm]] spells, but they themselves had [[truesight]], making it harder to use such spells against them.

==Combat==

Mariliths eagerly joined melee combat if given the chance, though they carefully sized up a given situation first and plotted to use any terrain and vulnerabilities to their advantage. They could swiftly strike with each weapon in their six hands, typically [[longsword]]s or [[scimitar]]s. Their tails were capable of moving like a whip or constricting their foes.

Marilith [[wizard]]s were truly terrifying beings. Not only did they not specialize in any one given [[Magic#Arcane magic|school]], but they had the rare power to cast spells with two of their arms while still fighting with two others. There were even rumors that some mariliths could cast more than one spell at once, but such claims were suspect.

==Society==
[[File:Balor_and_marilith.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''A balor (left) and a marilith.'']]
Mariliths served as commanders and tactical experts for the [[Blood War]], providing the stratagems to complement the malignant magnetism of the [[balor]]s. While the mariliths were typically the leaders of tanar'ri hordes, balors were often in charge of several hordes and commanded the masses in larger battles. Mariliths believed the balors were in charge only because of their sheer power and were otherwise unneeded to conduct the Blood War, but they never acted on this belief in fear of that power.

[[Glabrezu]]s were disliked by mariliths for their obnoxious insistence on using temptation and manipulation rather than outright warfare. Mariliths normally had to settle for merely undermining them as their balor superiors favored the glabrezus' sinister schemes.

[[Yuan-ti]] followers of [[Demogorgon]] and other [[demon prince]]s displayed an affinity for the similarly serpentine mariliths. A good method of currying their service was the sacrifice of strong mortal warriors.

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], three mariliths known as the "Triumvirate" served under [[Kaanyr Vhok]], the leader of the [[Scoured Legion]] of [[Hellgate Keep]]. One of those mariliths was Vhok's mother, [[Mulvassys|Mulvassys the Sceptered]].

In [[1385 DR]], the marilith [[Vhissilka]], who served the balor [[Axithar]], was trapped when the death of [[Mystra]] tore away a chunk of the [[Blood Rift]]. With the help of the [[cambion]] Kaanyr Vhok, Vhissilka was able to return to Axithar to wage war upon the [[House of the Triad]].

In [[1485 DR|1485]]â€“[[1486 DR]], mariliths were among the demons that wandered the streets of [[Menzoberranzan]] and participated in the failed defense of [[Q'Xorlarrin]] against the [[dwarves]]. The great [[Marilith (individual)|Marilith]], for whom all mariliths were named, was among them. She allowed [[Malagdorl Del'Armgo]] to slay and banish her back to Abyss, but [[Gromph Baenre]] resummoned her days later, making a fool out of Malagdorl for claiming he'd defeated her. She was subsequently sent to fight against the dwarves at Q'Xorlarrin. She was confronted by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who disabled her. [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] placed the final stroke that slew her and banished her.
