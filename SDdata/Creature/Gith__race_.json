Even the name of that original race, which some referred to as \"the forerunners\",{{Cite polyhedron/159/Incursion: Knights of the Lich-Queen|38-39}} located in an unknown [[crystal sphere]] that had been conquered by the illithids during the expansion of their empire, and who had been slowly altered by the mind flayers' genetic experiments. Others claimed that they might have been created by the illithids themselves through mixing humanoid hosts with powers from the [[Far Realm]].\n\n[[File:Githyanki-mind_flayer.jpg|thumb|250px|''A githyanki attacks a mind flayer.'']]\nIt had been suggested that the enslavement of the gith and the [[duergar]] happened during the early expansion of the mind flayer empire. Whether the gith were human or some unknown humanoid race, centuries of servitude and selective breeding changed them considerably. In a practical sense, the gith were in fact made by the mind flayers.\n\nAlthough revolts were not uncommon among the mind flayers' slaves, for a long time they posed no challenge. However, over time some slaves developed some resistance against their masters' mind control and started secretly improving their [[psionic]] abilities. When they judged that the time was right, the forerunners, under the guidance of their leader [[Gith]], revolted in an unprecedented uprising, causing a chain reaction that culminated in the death of countless [[elder brain]]s and ushered the downfall of the entire illithid empire.",
            "Civil War and Separation": "Soon after conquering their freedom, Gith ordered the continuation of the war effort. The mind flayers were to be hunted down to the last one and the gith were to establish a new empire based on conquest. At this point, [[Zerthimon]], a gith who had gathered a significant following during the fight for freedom, challenged Gith's leadership and her motives, arguing that she would end up leading the people into a similar tyranny that their former masters enforced.\n\nThe disagreement led to a violent civil war among the gith. Zerthimon was killed, and his followers, who called themselves \"githzerai\" (meaning \"those who spurn Gith\" in the Gith language\n\nGith led her surviving followers, who at this point started calling themselves \"githyanki\" (meaning \"children of Gith\"), to the former illithid settlements in the [[Astral Plane]], where they could regroup and gather their strength in order to resume their plans of conquering the entire [[multiverse]], as well as exterminating both the mind flayers and the githzerai. \n\nThus, the two divided races remained bitter enemies that constantly thwarted each other's plans. The githyanki expanded their conquering efforts to include raids into githzerai strongholds. The githzerai, while also deploying missions to root out and destroy illithid settlements, maintained a steady effort to oppose the githyanki militaristic expansion. This enduring conflict prevented either race from obtaining a decisive victory against the mind flayers and brought the conflict to a stalemate."
