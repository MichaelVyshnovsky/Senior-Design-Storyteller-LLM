        "mainbody": "A '''doomsphere''' was the [[ghost]] of a [[beholder]].",
        "Description": "Doomspheres appeared as transluscent, glowing beholders but otherwise looked much as they did in life. When visible, they appeared to be composed of a cloudy substance which had no mass.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to the many powers that a doomsphere posessed as a ghost, such as being [[incorporeal]] and having the abilty to possess living beings, they had several terrible powers unique to their origins as beholders. A doomsphere's central eye retained its ''[[antimagic]]'' field of vision, but most of its eyestalks developed different and more [[Necromancy|necromantic]] powers than the doomsphere had weilded in life. While it retained the eye ray that ''[[slow]]ed'' and the eye ray that caused ''[[fear]]'', it also gained the ability to fire a ray of ''[[enervation]]'', a ray of ''[[hold monster]]'', a ray of ''[[animate dead]]'', a ray of ''[[unholy blight]]'', a ray that seared flesh with [[Melf's acid arrow|magical acid]], a ray that shattered bone and chitine, a ray that caused the victim's strength and fortitude to wither, and a ray of cold light that attacked a target's constitution.\n\nDoomspheres were unable to harness [[psionics]], however they were highly resistant to such powers.\n\nSome doomspheres could compel a victim to harm itself.",
        "Personality": "In general, a doomsphere was a beholder of such avarice, wrath, and strength of will that it was able to sustain itself as an [[undead]] being. Since doomspheres had already tasted death once, they were often cautious and avoided engaging in senseless violence. Nevertheless, they thirsted to punish the living or seek revenge for their deaths.\n\nMost doomspheres could not speak, although they could read and write.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Doomsphere Attack by Raven Mimura.jpg|thumb|left|''A doomsphere annihilates a hapless humanoid''.]]In a fight, doomspheres attacked with their many ocular powers and with their ghostly, chilling bite. They tended to be careful, preferring to hide inside the ground or ceiling while spying on foes with their eyestalks, and then emerging suddenly to fire off eye rays at surprised targets. Doomspheres made a horrific shriek as they attacked.\n\nDoomspheres were difficult to ''[[Turn undead|turn]]'' and highly resistant to most mind- and body-altering [[spell]]s. They were immune to all forms of magical cold and electricity, and could only be harmed by powerful [[magic weapon]]s and spells. When injured, a chunk of the cloudy substance that comprised their bodies would be carried away. It was not possible to disable the central eye or sever any individual eyestalks of a doomsphere, but directly attacking an eyestalk could cause its power to discharge and then take a short while to recharge.\n\nA doomspere that was slain in combat would simply dissipate and then reform the next day unless the area was clensed with spells of ''[[remove curse]]'' and ''[[protection from evil]]''.",
        "Society": "[[File:Doomsphere IT.PNG|thumb|300px|A doomsphere fades from view.]]A doomsphere was generally created as a product of a [[magical]] explosion, sometimes produced by [[wild magic]] from failed efforts to create ''[[contingency|contingencies]]'' against their own deaths. They were solitary creatures, and would haunt the area in which they died. They spent much of their time ''[[invisibility|invisible]]'' and unmoving unless they detected a living creature nearby, in which case they became consumed with the desire to kill it. While they could be destroyed in combat with the aid of a [[cleric]], they could also be destroyed if their peculiar or sometimes ironic sense of vengeance for their death was appeased.\n\nDoomspheres avoided contact with other doomspheres, and were liable to destroy each other if they crossed paths.\n\nSome primitive tribes considered doomspheres so terrible as to be worthy of worship. On occasion, a doomsphere would even provide aid to its worshipers.",
        "Notable Doomspheres": "*[[Thaluul]], an infamous beholder originally from the [[Greypeak Hive]] who died in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, while fighting the [[ghost dragon]] [[Ghaulantatra]] in her lair.
