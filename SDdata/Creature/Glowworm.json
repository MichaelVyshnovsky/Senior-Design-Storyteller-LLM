        "Description": "Glowworms were tiny insects that created enough light, when assembled together, to read in the darkness or illuminate the area of {{SI|5'|'\"|long=yes}} with gentle dim light.",
        "Ecology": "Glowworms were fairly common insects and were collected to be sold living or dead. They used their light to attract flies, which they consumed.<ref name =\"tNP-ch16\" />\n\nAn edible species of glowworm native to the [[Underdark]] was collected for culinary use by [[drow]] and other subterranean [[humanoids]].\n\nGlowworms could be found inside the mega dungeon, [[Undermountain]] under [[Waterdeep]].\n\n[[Ulgarth]]an glowworms emitted brighter mauve-hued dim light than their [[Sword Coast]] cousins. One living glowworm per [[jar]] was enough to be used for lighting purposes.\n\nGlowworms from the caves of [[Calimshan]] were known to emit greenish white lights. They covered the ceilings like stars, flickering when one of them caught a midge.<ref name =\"tNP-ch16\" />",
        "Usage": "*[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] sold glowworm tails for 1 [[sp]] per 5 pieces, and whole dead glowworms for the same price per 5 insects in the catalogue's wizarding section.\n*''[[Corpselight]]'' spell required a pinch of [[saltpeter]], and a bit or [[phosphorous]] or a glowworm.\n*''[[Dancing lights]]'' spell required a material component, a glowworm, phosphorus, or [[wychwood]].\n*'''Edible glowworms''' of the Underdark were consumed raw, dipped in rock [[salt]]. This [[drow]] snack was favorite of one of the [[Chosen of Mystra]], [[Qilu√© Veladorn]].\n*''Jars of glowworms'' were often sold to adventurers for 5 [[gp]]. The jar was filled with living glowworms and was used to create a dim light that aided them when they needed to remain undetected in the darkness. The jars could be tied to a {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}} pole to illuminate any possible danger in the darkness or spring any traps that were triggered by the pretense of living beings.\n*A phosphorescent paint could be made by mixing glowworm juice with [[ormu]] powder.{{Cite dragon/211/Fungi of the Underdark|211}}\n*''[[Tulrun's tracer]]'' spell required a pinch of phosphorus or a living thing that emitted light, like a phosphorescent [[fungus]] or a glowworm.",
        "History": "In [[1492 DR]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]] kept a terrarium filled with glowworms in his components storage room inside [[Halaster's Hold]] on the 23rd level of [[Undermountain]]."
