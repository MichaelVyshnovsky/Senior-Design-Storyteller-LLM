'''Moon-horses''', also called '''''teu'kelytha''''' in [[Elvish]], were intelligent, magic-using [[horse]]s found on [[Evermeet]].

==Description==
Moon-horses had coats that ranged from white to silvery gray. Their manes could be any color between white and black.

==Behavior==
Moon-horses were highly intelligent and resembled [[elf|elves]] in personality. They willingly served elves as mounts and cavalry. When they roamed free, they often joined up in herds.

==Combat==
Moon-horses were used by elven knights in combat. They had the ability to cast one [[arcane]] spell per day. The spells they were known to use were ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[shield (spell)|shield]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[wall of fog]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[summon swarm]]'', and ''[[web]]''. Moon-horses were immune to special attacks by [[undead]].

==Locations==
[[File:Moon horse.png|thumb|280px|right|''A moon-horse with black hair.'']]
Moon-horses were found all over Evermeet. Moon-horse mounts were not stabled but instead allowed to run free in common herds. Large common herds could be found in [[Greenmeadow]], [[Drelagara]], [[Ty'athalael]], and [[Horsefields]]. Dreglagara was the center of moon-horse breeding and training.

==History==
Moon-horses were native to Evermeet and [[Arcorar]] (the forest around the [[Elven Court]] in [[Cormanthor]]). They resided in former times on the continent of [[Faer√ªn]], where they were used by the knights of [[Cormanthyr]], but the last of the moon-horses were brought back to Evermeet during the [[Retreat]].

==Notable moon-horses==
* [[Yalanga]], the mount of Lord [[Tolthe Alerothi]] of Drelagara.
* [[Moonstone (horse)|Moonstone]], the mount of [[Sharlarra Vendreth]].
* [[Sundancer (horse)|Sundancer]], the mount of [[Keryth Blackhelm]].
