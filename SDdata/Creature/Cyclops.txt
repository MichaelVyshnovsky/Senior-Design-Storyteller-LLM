'''Cyclopes''' ({{Singular|cyclops}}; {{Plural|cyclopes|refs={{Cite dragon/169/Editorial: The answers (sort of) at last!|6}}}} {{Plural|cyclopses|alt=yes|refs=}}) were a race of [[giant-kin]] distinguished by having a singular, central eye.

==Description==
Cyclopes were one of the smallest types of giants, standing only {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} and weighing {{SI|1200|lb|k|long=yes}}, Cyclopes had earthy skin tones that blended with their surroundings. Males and females cyclopes of the [[Feywild]] were notably bald and had spiked heads instead of hair.

The most peculiar and distinguishing thing about cyclopes was the fact that they only had one large eye in the middle of their foreheads. It tended to be the same as the color of their skin. This eye was rumored to cause [[fear]] in any who looked at it. Their single eye gave them poor depth perception, however, and therefore they couldn't use missile weapons very well.

==Abilities==
Cyclopes could throw boulders

==Society==
===Religion===
Cyclopes typically worshiped [[Grolantor]], for they admired his power and might over giant-kin.{{Cite dragon/362/The Eye of Madness: Tyrants of the Feydark}}

Other sources claimed that cyclopes did not worship any gods, as they saw little benefit from prayer and disliked rituals for they seemed too complicated and foreign. However, a cyclops that gained some kind of benefits of apparently divine origin or else was threatened an unnatural force would pay homage to the supposed deity in order to retain their gift or avoid that threat, at least while it remained.

===Craft===
Cyclopes made many different and powerful magical and non-[[magical item]]s. Their most proficient blacksmiths could forge rings of great magical power and swords with blades of lightning. Fomorians were known to highly value their skill in forging magical items.

===Activities===
[[File:Neverwinter_MMO_-_Creature_-_Cyclops_(Hewer_-_Storm_Shaman).png|thumb|right|''A pair of cyclopes.'']]
They usually served as bodyguards, blacksmiths, soldiers, Some [[eladrin]] believed that the roles they played in these societies were so crucial that they would be severely weakened without the cyclopes.

===Homelands===
Some cyclopes lived in such places as [[Nacmoran]].

When not living in cities, many cyclopes lived in caves, ruins, or forests:
* [[Citadel Umbra]]
* [[Curna Mountains]]
* [[Giant's Belt Mountains]] 
* [[Kryonar's Caverns]]
* [[Mines of Tethyamar]]
* [[Oman]]
* [[Veldorn]]
* [[Snapping Turtle Bay]]

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], cyclopes could be found in the Feywild, particularly in the [[Dark fey enclave]] and [[Realm of Malabog]]. They also existed on the plane of [[Arborea]]'s layer known as [[Arvandor (layer)|Olympus]]<ref><ref><ref> and on the plane of [[Theros]].<ref>

==History==
There existed a wide variety of contradictory legends surrounding the origins of the cyclopes, many of them not having originated from the cyclopes themselves. They generally had little interest in how their people came to be, though many on Toril claimed they descended from the line of [[Annam All-Father]], chief of the [[Giant pantheon]]. Most other giants on Toril believed the brutes came from one of [[Othea]]'s trysts. Other myths suggested they were descendants of Annam's son [[Karontor]] following his banishment or were descendants of the god [[Vaprak]].

According to some accounts, the cyclopes originated in the Feywild, claimed that some of the cyclopes were originally the children of the primeval deities [[Gaea]] and [[Uranus]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|2}} the latter of whom locked them up in the plane of [[Tarterus]] until they were eventually freed and later aided the Olympians in overthrowing the [[greater titan]]s.<ref>

==Notable Cyclopes==
