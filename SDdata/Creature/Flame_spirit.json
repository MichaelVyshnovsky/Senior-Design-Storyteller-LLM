Flame spirits had two oval shaped eyes, which were its only facial feature. They were capable of speech and when they spoke it sounded like steam hissing from a pipe. \n\nEach type of flame spirit had a slight difference in appearances. The color of a greater flame spirit shifted constantly from green, red and yellow, while a lesser flame spirits flame was dull orange and a least flame spirits brilliant white. Each had a tendril of fire that randomly emerged from the ball of flame. This tendril was {{SI|5|ft}} in length for greater flame spirits, {{SI|3|ft}} for lesser flame spirits and {{SI|2|ft|c}} for least flame spirits.",

        "Uses": "The ashes of combustible material consumed by lesser and least flame spirits could be used as components in the creation of magical items. The ash from a piece of parchment that was consumed by a lesser flame spirits was used as a component in creating ''[[spirit chaser]]s'', while the ash from a piece of [[silk]] that was consumed by a least flame spirit was used as a component in creating a ''[[charm of protection from fire]]''."
