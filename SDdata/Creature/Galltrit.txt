'''Galltrits''' were a winged species of [[gremlin]].

==Description==
Galltrits on average grew to be {{SIrange|0.5'0"|0'6"|ft-in}} tall. Their bodies had stony grey skin. They were often very hard to detect.

==Personality==
Galltrits had an average level of intelligence. They had nasty dispositions and would often attack if disturbed. If caught feeding by their prey, they would try to make a hasty retreat.

==Biology==
Much like a [[vampire bat]], the saliva of these creatures possessed both an anesthetic and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant anti-coagulant] properties. This made it so that the nerves and skin around where a galltrit bit became temporarily deadened, preventing their victim from feeling anything, and prolonging the period of bleeding. They would then suck blood from their victim until either full or detected.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], galltrits could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]]. And following its destruction, they could be found in the ruins of [[Zhentil Keep]].<ref>

==Society==
Much like the standard gremlin, galltrits traveled in packs. Some were known to carry around [[gem]]s.
===Diet===
Galltrits primarily subsisted upon blood.
===Homelands===
Galltrits could be found in a variety of habitats and climates. However, they primarily lived in areas of carrion, dung, and offal.
