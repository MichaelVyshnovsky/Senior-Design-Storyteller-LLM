        "mainbody": "skittering horror was a giant, worm-like aberration that originated from the Far Realm.\nThey had many curved claws running down the sides of their bodies.\nWhile they did not regularly possess knowledge of known languages, at least one skittering horror was capable of intelligent speech. It had the tendency to offer valuable information to others for its own benefit.\nSkittering horrors could crawl along the sides of surfaces or along ceilings with ease. They attacked others with their numerous claws or giant mandibles.\nThese aberrations were so horrifying that their mere presence could cause onlookers to become paralyzed with fear.\n* Shadow in the Ice, one horror that served as the herald of Father Llymic. It was summoned into Xorvintroth from the Far Realm and became encased in ice after the city was transported to the frozen wastes in the Spine of the World."
