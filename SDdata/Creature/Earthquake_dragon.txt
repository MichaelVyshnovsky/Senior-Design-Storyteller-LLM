'''Earthquake dragons''' were a variety of [[catastrophic dragon]] that were menaces to civilization because of both their earth-shaking powers and vicious temperaments.

==Description==
They were classically draconic in form, but appeared to be formed of solid stone.

==Personality==
Earthquake dragon were vicious and temperamental, hunting people as much for sport as for food. They were solitary by nature, though inedible creatures of stone such as [[galeb duhr]] or genasi were known to ally with them for purposes of destruction- but they were fickle allies, quickly growing restless and liable to turn on former allies when they grew bored.

==Abilities==
Like many other dragons, earthquake dragons grew stronger as they grew older. They were naturally capable of both flight and burrowing, though they were only clumsy fliers and preferred to stay underground; they possessed both darkvision and, more pertinently, tremorsense.

Earthquake dragons lacked breath weapons, but their earth-shaking powers made up for it. Their very presence in an area caused small tremors, and when they truly attacked they could level cities.

==Combat==
Earthquake dragons preferred stealth and burrowing while hunting, and when they attacked they unleashed their full power right from the start. They preferred to focus on enemies that fled them, and would toy with them until the dragon grew bored. If it looked like they might be defeated, they would retreat into the ground and use tremorsense to monitor their foes.

==Ecology==
When an earthquake dragon came to a new area, it caused first minor tremors, and later on true quakes, until buildings crumbled and the land was rent with new-formed chasms. After eating and chasing away inhabitants, earthquake dragons would rest in the ruins of cities for months, until they grew bored and moved on to a new region.

[[Earth archon]]s, galeb duhr, genasi, [[stone giant]]s, and [[goliath]]s were all known to ally with earthquake dragons in order to destroy enemies, but the dragons were poor allies. However, they had a weakness for gemstones, and thus their continued cooperation could be bought.

==History==
It was said that when [[Erek-Hus]] slew [[Io]], some dragons felt fear that they had not known before, and so they fled, seeking one who would protect them. A primordial of impenetrable stone, Balcoth, called the Groaning King, welcomed them, but fulfilled his promise of protection by swallowing them all into his furnace-like stomach, where they petrified. Some, he later vomited up as servants, while others escaped years later when he was decapitated by the gods.
