Owls were nocturnal birds of prey.
Owls had excellent hearing and could move quite quietly. When flying they typically made no noise. 
Their eyes were capable of seeing in total darknessTheir Monster Manual II entry simply stated that their ultravision was double the normal range. The ranges shown were approximated from multiplying the base ranges outlined in Players Handbook 1st edition. Altogether these senses made it incredibly difficult to sneak up on or surprise owls, whether they be in dark conditions or outside at dusk.
Owls swooped silently at their prey, attacking with both powerful talons at once, and then flew easily out of reach. They also were known to attack with their beaks.

Owls were a carnivorous species. Species of bird active at daylight hours were often preyed upon by them, such as crows and ravens.
These birds typically inhabited forests in regions with a temperate climate. During daylight hours they roosted in very secluded areas.
Owls could be found across much of the North.
Beyond Faerûn, owls could be found in the Hordelands at the Katakoro Plateau.
Beyond the Prime Material plane, owls could be found in the forests of Barovia.
If taken care of at a young age owls could be domesticated, though they could not be trained to hunt.
Owls were sometimes used by hunters as decoys since many of the daylight birds that they preyed upon, such as crows and ravens, would flock to attack them during their hours of activity. While doing so, such birds were so vicious and determined to kill the owl that they loss all sense of caution.
The goddess Selûne was known to show her favor or presence by sending owls as an omen or guide.
