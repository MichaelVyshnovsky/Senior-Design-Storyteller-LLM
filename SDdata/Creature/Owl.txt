'''Owls''' were nocturnal birds of prey.

==Biology==
Owls had excellent hearing and could move quite quietly. When flying they typically made no noise. 

Their eyes were capable of seeing in [[Darkvision|total darkness]]<ref group="note" name="ultravision">Their ''[[Monster Manual II 1st edition|Monster Manual II]]'' entry simply stated that their ultravision was double the normal range. The ranges shown were approximated from multiplying the base ranges outlined in ''[[Players Handbook 1st edition]]''. Altogether these senses made it incredibly difficult to sneak up on or surprise owls, whether they be in dark conditions or outside at dusk.

==Combat==
Owls swooped silently at their prey, attacking with both powerful talons at once, and then flew easily out of reach. They also were known to attack with their beaks.

==Species==
* [[Burrowing owl]], a species of owl endemic to the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]].
* [[Talking owl]], a particularly intelligent species of owl.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Owls were a carnivorous species. Species of bird active at daylight hours were often preyed upon by them, such as [[crow]]s and [[raven]]s.
===Habitats===
These birds typically inhabited forests in regions with a temperate climate.<ref name=MM35-p277 /> During daylight hours they roosted in very secluded areas.

Owls could be found across much of [[the North]].

Beyond [[Faerûn]], owls could be found in the [[Hordelands]] at the [[Katakoro Plateau]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], owls could be found in the forests of [[Barovia]].

===Relationships===
If taken care of at a young age owls could be domesticated, though they could not be trained to hunt.

Owls were sometimes used by hunters as decoys since many of the daylight birds that they preyed upon, such as crows and ravens, would flock to attack them during their hours of activity. While doing so, such birds were so vicious and determined to kill the owl that they loss all sense of caution.

The goddess [[Selûne]] was known to show her favor or presence by sending owls as an omen or guide.{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|135}}{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8, 14}}

==Notable Owls==
* [[Hooter]], the scout of [[Montolio Debrouchee]].
