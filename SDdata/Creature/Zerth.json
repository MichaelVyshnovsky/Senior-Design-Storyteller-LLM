        "mainbody": "Zerths were especially adept githzerai monks who best followed the teachings of Zerthimon. Through rigid discipline and training, they were capable of remarkable psionic feats.\nHighly skilled in martial and psionic arts, zerths were capable of transporting between planes only using their minds. They were capable of innately casting plane shift once per day. In combat, they could also use their minds to inflict damage upon their opponents, through innately casting phantasmal killer.\nEspecially gifted zerths, known as \"enlightened\", were capable of even more extraordinary psionic feats, such as innately casting haste and teleport and enhancing their own defenses through psionic power.\nZerths filled the equivalent role of priests in the non-religious githzerai society.  They were considered the inheritors of Zerthimons philosophies, as well as his first choice to assist him directly upon his prophesied return. Following the githzerai custom of paying respects to their departed ancestors, it was common for zerths to honor Zerthimon in the same way.\nThe honorific title of zerth could also be granted to githzerai who pursued diverse disciplines, in particular mixing martial and psionic training with arcane studies. It was usually bestowed upon students who had proven their skills during challenging missions.\nthumb|250px|Yrlakka and his zerth disciples in Undermountain.\n* Yrlakka, Azal, Vond, Rishindar, and Ezria, a group of zerths who had taken residence in Undermountain in the late 15 century DR.\n* Zhjaeve, a zerth who accompanied the Kalach-Cha to fight the King of Shadows.\n* Dakkon, a former zerth whose heretical thoughts disrupted the fabric of Limbo and led to the fall of Shraktlor."
