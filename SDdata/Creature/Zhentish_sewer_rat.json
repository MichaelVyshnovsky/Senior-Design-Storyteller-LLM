        "mainbody": "Zhentish sewer rats were large rodents found in the sewers and catacombs beneath Zhentil Keep.\nThese creatures appeared like larger versions of common sewer rats, typically measuring  in length. A Zhentish sewer rats eyes glowed deep yellow and their faces eerily appeared to be slightly human. Their bodies were covered with thick black hair and they smelled of sewer waste and mildew.\nSome scholars believed these creatures had their own form of rudimentary language. They were always gathered into packs of at least three individuals but sometimes as many as several dozen. A single or pair of Zhentish sewer rats did anything possible to remain hidden. They were only bold enough to attack in groups of three or more. Each pack was lead by a strong alpha rat. These rats were easily blinded by brighter lights.\nZhentish sewer rats could bite with their sharpened incisor teeth and even fasten themselves to their target. These creatures possessed an innate ability similar to a displacer beast, making it very difficult to strike them on the first swing.\nDespite their name, Zhentish sewer rats ventured forth into the land around Zhentil Keep provided it had enough rotting vegetation and water for their liking. They only ventured out during the day when the sun was highly overcast.\nGiven the inherent cruelty of these creatures, some scholars joked that Banes anger fled into the Zhentish sewer rat upon his death. Only vampires, tanarri, and baatezu were able to exercise a degree of control over them.\nJermlaines were considered a delicacy to these creatures.\nZhentarim wizards attempted to create cloaks of displacement by using Zhentish sewer rat hides, but their efforts failed. Other Zhentish alchemists attempted to create a potion that would provide the same effect and they paid up to 500 gold pieces for a freshly killed Zhentish sewer rat."
