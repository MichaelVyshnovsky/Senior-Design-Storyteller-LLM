A '''platypus''' was a species strange animal that lived on a small island off the coast of [[Orlil]], [[Lantan]], alongside a village of intelligent and speaking [[wombat]]s.
{{quote|I had left off pining for home and rather looked forward to seeing a city larger than fifty wombats and the occasional odd platypusâ€”though, to be perfectly blunt, I've never met a platypus who wasn't rather odd.|[[Byrt]]}}

==Description==
A platypus was a natural beast that seemingly was cobbled together out of leftover parts of other animals. They had [[beaver]]-like tails and bodies, [[duck]]-like bills, webbed feet for swimming, and venomous barbs.{{Cite dragon/341/Familiar Flavoring|89}}

==Ecology==
Platypuses laid eggs and lived in the vicinity of water, riverbanks, and lakes. A sentient group of wombats and platypuses could be found inhabiting a small island off the coast of Orlil.
