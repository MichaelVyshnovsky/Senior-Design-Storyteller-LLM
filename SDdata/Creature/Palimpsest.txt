A '''palimpsest''' was a piece of parchment that became animated by the magical runes it contained for long periods of time.

==Description==
A palimpsest looked exactly like a normal sheet of parchment. They could move about as if blown by a gust of wind.

==Combat==
These creatures hid in areas where it was common to find parchment such as within [[book]]s, on desks, or in [[scroll]] cases. They could sense sound and movement and attacked when their target was nearby and barely moving, usually completely surprising a target and drawing them into their page and absorbing their energy. The features of an absorbed target would appear on the palimpsest as a sketch. Absorbing a target took several minutes and left the creature vulnerable, which was why palimpsests usually only attacked solitary targets.

Victims of a palimpsest attack could only be restored via a ''[[wish]]''. Palimpsests were immune to harm from edged weapons and all forms of fire. A ''[[shocking grasp]]'' spell had a chance to dislodge a victim being absorbed. ''[[Lightning bolt]]'' and ''[[chain lightning]]'' had greater chances of saving a target in the same manner.

==Society==
These were solitary creatures but rumors existed that they could reproduce by splitting themselves into separate creatures.

==History==
Palimpsests were created in the [[Ethereal plane]] and were capable of drawing spellcasters into other planes. Some believed they were first created by the [[Arcane (race)|Arcane]] in order to gather magical energy.

A palimpsest killed [[Eltaor]], the fourth [[Coronal]] of [[Uvaeren]], in [[-6300 DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
An entire library full of palimpsests was rumored to exist somewhere within [[Undermountain]], set there as a cruel joke by [[Halaster Blackcloak]]. [[Adventurer]]s from [[Skullport]] even claimed the titles of palimpsest volumes were enticing such as ''Elminster's Black Book''.
