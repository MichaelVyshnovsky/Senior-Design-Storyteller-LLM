        "mainbody": "Flying snakes were brightly colored, winged serpents found in tropical locations and remote jungles such as Chult.\nDuring the late 15 century DR, flying snakes trained as messengers were popular with members of the Zhentarim and were sometimes recognized as symbols of the faction. \nIn Port Nyanzaru, the merchant prince Ifan Talroa sold flying snakes exclusively to members of the Zhentarim.\nFlying snakes could sometimes be domesticated to serve as messengers that delivered scrolls wrapped in their coils.\nBesides Chult, flying snakes were known to inhabit the Wood of Dark Trees.\nFlying snakes were often gifted by the deity Sseth to his wizard or priest worshipers as familiars or animal companions."
