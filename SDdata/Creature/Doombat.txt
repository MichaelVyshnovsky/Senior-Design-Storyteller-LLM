This aspect of the creature was, however, dropped in its ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' incarnation for reasons unknown.

'''Doombats''' were a kind of gigantic [[bat]] with a barbed tail.

==Description==
Doombats appeared as giant black bats with a wingspan of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} and a barbed tail of up to {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} long.

==Abilities==
Owing to their powerful wings, doombats had a carrying capacity of up to {{SI|300|lb|k|long=yes}} in flight.

The sonar yip present in regular bats evolved into a potent sonic attack in doombats. The shriek, which a doombat could continuously maintain for up to 30 seconds, had a debilitating effect on creatures up to a distance of {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}. While under the effect of this shriek, spellcasters were rendered unable to cast [[spell]]s.

==Behavior==
Doombats typically attacked and tried to kill every living creature they saw while hunting.

Although they could be kept at bay by particularly bright lights, such as that produced by a ''[[light]]'' spell, doombats were undeterred by more dim sources, such as [[torch]]es and [[lantern]]s.

==Ecology==
Doombats typically kept to underground areas undisturbed by underground civilizations,{{Cite dragon/152/The Wanderers Below}} although they were sometimes summoned and kept by the [[orc]]ish [[shaman]]s of [[Shargaas]] as mounts.

During nighttime, doombats took to the surface in order to hunt. They were not picky about their prey, and could sometimes even be found around aboveground graveyards.{{Cite dragon/114/Grave encounters|23}}

==History==
Sometime after [[Castle Kilgrave]] was abandoned in the midâ€“13{{th}} century DR, doombats started inhabiting the site. When [[Bane]] took the castle over during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], this flock ended up expelled from their lair and the doombats were seen hunting far away from their lair.

==Notable Doombats==
By the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the [[lich]] [[Azimer]] kept a doombat as a guardian during his stay in the abandoned [[School of Wizardry]].{{Cite dragon/95/Into the Forgotten Realms|51}}
