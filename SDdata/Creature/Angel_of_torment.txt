'''Angels of torment''' were [[Angel (astral)|angels]] who meted out cruel retribution on behalf of the [[deity]] whom they served.{{Cite dungeon/177/Deities & Demigods: Torog, the King that Crawls|75}}

==Description==
Some angels of torment were maimed, with their angelic bodies defaced by injury or their wings torn off (although even if their wings appeared to be ruined, angels of torment were still able to fly and hover).{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|22}}

Other types of angels could be transformed into angels of torment if submitted to sufficient mental anguish and torture.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|5}}

==Personality==
Angels of torment were both sadistic and masochistic. They were unswervingly faithful to their divine patrons&mdash;even those who tortured them&mdash;and would even maim themselves as a show of subservience.

==Abilities==
Any creature marked as a foe by an angel of torment found itself injured just by being within its presence. However, the angel lost the power to inflict this pain if it was isolated from the [[Astral Plane]] or from its divine patron for long periods of time.

==Combat==
Angels of torment lashed out with their hooked chains, which painfully latched onto the flesh of victims up to {{SI|15|feet|long=yes}} away and allowing them to be dragged into the reach of the angel's acid-drenched claws.

They could also unleash a wave of energy that tormented and dazed creatures' minds while searing their flesh with [[radiant energy]].

==Society==
[[Evil]] gods used angels of torment to spread terror in their names, and would send them to commit horrific acts on the [[Material Plane]]. [[Torog]] favored angels of torment above all his other angels and servants, although this did not spare them from extensive torture&mdash;from his hand and their own.

Meanwhile, [[good]]ly gods used angels of torment as an extension of their divine wrath, and only directed them at those who had committed extraordinary crimes. 

==Notable Angels of Torment==
* [[Zaol]], an [[angel of vengeance]] transformed into an angel of torment by the incessant whispers of a [[Zhengyian artifact]].
