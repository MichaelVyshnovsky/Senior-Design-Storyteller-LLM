Angels of torment were angels who meted out cruel retribution on behalf of the deity whom they served.
Some angels of torment were maimed, with their angelic bodies defaced by injury or their wings torn off (although even if their wings appeared to be ruined, angels of torment were still able to fly and hover).
Other types of angels could be transformed into angels of torment if submitted to sufficient mental anguish and torture.
Angels of torment were both sadistic and masochistic. They were unswervingly faithful to their divine patrons&mdasheven those who tortured them&mdashand would even maim themselves as a show of subservience.
Any creature marked as a foe by an angel of torment found itself injured just by being within its presence. However, the angel lost the power to inflict this pain if it was isolated from the Astral Plane or from its divine patron for long periods of time.
Angels of torment lashed out with their hooked chains, which painfully latched onto the flesh of victims up to  away and allowing them to be dragged into the reach of the angels acid-drenched claws.
They could also unleash a wave of energy that tormented and dazed creatures minds while searing their flesh with radiant energy.
Evil gods used angels of torment to spread terror in their names, and would send them to commit horrific acts on the Material Plane. Torog favored angels of torment above all his other angels and servants, although this did not spare them from extensive torture&mdashfrom his hand and their own.
Meanwhile, goodly gods used angels of torment as an extension of their divine wrath, and only directed them at those who had committed extraordinary crimes.
