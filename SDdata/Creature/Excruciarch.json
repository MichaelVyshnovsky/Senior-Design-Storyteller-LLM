        "mainbody": "cruciarchs were bald, pale-skinned humanoids that stood just under {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed about {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}}. They typically wore blood-stained [[leather]] [[apron]]s over their suits of [[leather armor]] and wielded two-handed [[flail]]s covered in spikes and long, sharp blades. Their faces were hidden by black-spiked masks held in place by a narrow leather strap, revealing only their baleful red eyes.",
        "Description": "Excruciarchs were bald, pale-skinned humanoids that stood just under {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed about {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}}. They typically wore blood-stained [[leather]] [[apron]]s over their suits of [[leather armor]] and wielded two-handed [[flail]]s covered in spikes and long, sharp blades. Their faces were hidden by black-spiked masks held in place by a narrow leather strap, revealing only their baleful red eyes.",
        "Personality": "Excruciarchs were utterly sadistic creatures that delighted in causing suffering and derived dreadful pleasure from bringing pain to the helpless. Such an eye did they have for torture that the insightful devils could, within seconds, study an opponent's defenses to identify where to strike to negate them.",
        "Abilities": "Excruciarchs, like other fiends, possessed several spell-like abilities, including being able to mimic the effects of ''[[vampiric touch]]'' and ''[[greater teleport]]'' (itself only plus {{SI|50|lb|k}} of objects) at will, and ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' and ''[[wave of grief]]'' thrice per day. Additionally, once per day a pain devil could attempt to summon another pain devil, although this only worked a little less than half the time.\n\nExcruciarchs gained almost supernatural power through the act of hurting others. In battle they wielded ''hell scourges'', ''+3'' [[cold iron]] [[spiked chain]]s that they could instantly recreate and which crumbled to worthless dust out of their hands. Through these weapons pain devils could send a wave of agonizing arcane energy, wracking their foe with unimaginable pain to leave them briefly crippled and unable to defend themselves. They also radiated an aura of suffering and misery that caused painful wounds to spontaneously appear on nearby non-devils.",
        "Combat": "Despite their relative weakness among other devils, excruciarchs were eager, bloodthirsty combatants who relished a good fight and the chance to crush their foes beneath their scourges. Their sadism spurred them on in particular when they landed an especially devastating blow, notably weakened a foe, or simply had unleashed enough collective pain on anything nearby.\n\nHowever, pain devils were not mindless fighters, as indicated by their skill in deciphering ways around their opponent's defenses and resistances through their torturous expertise. They generally targeted nimble enemies, using the debilitating powers of their scourges to keep them within fighting range while leveraging their superior reach to keep them at arm's length. They utilized hit-and-run tactics, attacking and stepping back to force the foe to keep up with them or leaving them crippled before moving so far away that the enemy could do little but try to reach them again. They could also unleash a wave of pain, striking several enemies at once with their scourges, but this was usually withheld until their were multiple foes to strike or until their sadism was spurred.\n\nPain devils fought best in pairs, where they lured specific targets away from the safety of their allies through their usual tactics of forcing an approach. Often they spread out amidst the enemy, positioning where their aura of torment would envelop the most foes, before flanking them, forcing the warriors of a group to decide which one to engage. One might move into the midst of the more physically vulnerable before whirling their hell scourges in a wide, deadly arc above their heads, preventing any others from safely or quickly approaching. Meanwhile, the second moved in to attack, forcing those caught in the maneuver to either flee and suffer the whirling of the first or stand their ground against the direct attacks of the second.\n\nPain devil captains differed from their inferiors in several ways. Though they too waded into battle pounding enemies with their scourges, they might also avoid the fray until directly attacked or a threat proved dangerous enough to wound a fellow devil, instead commanding from afar. Strikes from their scourges left their outright victims weakened rather than slowed and rather than unleashing waves of pain they could ignite the weapons of nearby allies (which they did as often as possible). Furthermore, their sadism was a step beyond that of their common kin, such that their cruelty rejuvenated their peers.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Exactly how pain devils operated depended on their layer. They existed throughout all the Nine Hells, though were common on the upper layers, especially [[Dis]].\n\nOn [[Avernus]], bands of pain devils watched listless soul shells mill about in stony, garrison style-structures, crankily ensuring none escaped. Eventually a legion of them hauled trembling, insensate soul shells from carts and wagons before prodding the protesting petitioners into the crater of the Maggot Pit. There they quickly drowned, were consumed by the worms, excreted out, coalesced into lemures, and then fished out by the excruciarchs with nets.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Malbolge]]'s soul shells were taken to the bulging Birthing Pit, where they suffered a similar process. After being pushed in by pain devils and devoured by dozens of toothless mouths, lemures dribbled down the side of the earthen mound. However, [[Glasya]] was disgusted by lemures, and so the miserable creatures were driven off by the pain devils to mindlessly wander Malbolge.\n\nPain devils were most common on [[Cania]], where they crept and crawled through the tunnels of [[Mephistopheles]]â€™s dungeons, practicing on the captives.",
            "Other Devils": "Pain devils were often given the task of administering the punishment of demotion for other baatezu. While a less severe failure might only warrant a loss in position and caste, some were sent by their masters for more extreme lessons in duty and obedience. After a regiment of gruesome disfigurement, the pain devils extracted the devil's brain through their nostrils, leaving a [[nupperibo]] behind. As one might expect, pain devils were feared and reviled by most other devils, who wasted no time destroying any they found alone and unbound to a devil lord's service.\n\nDue to these poor relations with their fellow devils, excruciarchs usually accepted the patronage of more powerful fiends, serving in the courts of [[pit fiend]]s and [[archdevil]]s. However, pain devils were mercenaries at heart, and would work for all the lords and ladies of the Nine Hells in turn,\n\nPain devils had an intense and deadly rivalry with the [[chain devil]]s, their chief competition as torturers and interrogators, such that the two types of devils endlessly plotted against each other.\n\nNotably, [[Styx devil]]s handed captives over to pain devils, but not before attempting to tortuously tease the secrets out of them themselves.",
            "Mortals": "Pain devils also sold their services beyond the Nine Hells, such as the [[Material Plane]], and could be found in the company of various evil creatures. They were summoned by sadistic mortals as mercenaries, but also traveled there themselves in search of new creatures to experiment on. An evil spellcaster could alter the spell ''[[summon monster VI]]'', allowing them to summon excruciarchs at the cost of the ability to summon kytons."
