        "mainbody": "'''Tigbanua buso''' ({{Pronounce|tig|ban|oo|ah|_|boo|so|refs=}}) were a race of vicious and ghoulish creatures native to [[Kara-Tur]]. They were the most common type of buso, the only known other type being the victims of their infection, the [[tagamaling buso]].",
        "Description": "Standing {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall and emaciated, weighing only {{SI|140|lb|k|long=yes}}, tigbanuas had long and flexible necks, large bony feet, and gnarled hands with sharp claws. They had depressed noses, their mouths were filled with sharp teeth, and their hair was curly. Their skin was pale and had the texture of leather. The most distinguishing feature of a tigbanua was its large eye in the center of its head; it could be red or yellow. Tigbanuas were generally covered in dirt, filthy, or grime.",
        "Combat": "With no clever tactics, tigbanuas simply came out under cover of night, targeting lone humanoids like vulnerable villagers and travelers. Using their sharp claws and fangs, they attacked with great ferocity whenever they got the chance. Otherwise, they were rarely brave.",
        "Abilities": "The tigbanua had an aura of fear. Any creature within 10 feet (3 meters) of a tigbanua felt great fear, enough to make them cower or even be paralyzed with terror if they couldn't resist, while it was in this range. Understandably, this left them vulnerable to attack. and could be undone with ''[[remove paralysis]]'', provided the tigbanua hadn't already killed and eaten the victim by then.\n\nTigbanuas transmitted a terrible disease via their claws, and any [[humanoid]] struck by them who was infected and did not seek healing became a [[tagamaling buso]], a lesser form of the tigbanua buso.\n\nSome tigbanuas could twist or bend their necks so they could look directly behind themselves.",
        "Behavior": "Having only animal intelligence but a chaotic and evil nature, they lived alone or in small packs of up to six. \n\nDespite their lack of intelligence, busos had their own language.",
        "Ecology": "Despite resembling [[ghoul]]s in form and habit, tigbanua buso were not [[undead]]. They were carnivorous, and their diet consisted of the flesh of any animal or humanoid. Meat from corpses found in graves was considered a prized delicacy among tigbanuas.",
        "History": "[[File:Buso 2e.jpg|thumb|''A depiction of tigbanua buso's up-close face and full body.'']]\nAlthough the origin of the tigbanua buso was unknown, rumors in Kara-Tur held that they were once an advanced and peaceful race who dwelt in the southern mountainous region of [[Shou Lung]].  Afterward, the tigbanuas dispersed across Kara-Tur. \n\nOnce, several centuries before {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, a [[human]] [[wu jen]] of [[Wa]] who had incredible power and incredible ambition even tried to challenge the [[Eight Million Gods]] for control of [[Toril]]. For anyone else, the gods might just have ignored him, but for a wu jen of his power, they dared not. Thus, an alliance among the gods cursed him and transformed into [[Tigbanua buso (wu jen)|a tigbanua buso]]. This didn't exactly eliminate his threat, however: as a tigbanua buso, he attacked innocents and could turn them into tagamaling busos.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, an unusually intelligent tigbanua named [[Getsu]] tried to destroy the city of [[Nakamaru]] in Wa by turning as many of its citizens as he could into tagamalings who would slaughter the rest. He had at least commoners infected within the first 99 days and went on to attack the [[Worthless Flower]] [[yakuza]] gang before adventurers likely stopped him.\n\nA band of tigbanua entered the [[Kichai District]] of [[T'u Lung]] in the month of Yang in {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}} and started raiding villages. The local township officer offered a reward to those who killed them.",
        "Lands": "Tigbanua buso were found across Kara-Tur,\n\nBuso were known to live in the [[Himasla Mountains]] in [[Malatra]], where they fought with patrols of the [[Kuong Kingdom]] around the town of [[Garuji]].\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|1433|WY}}, at least three tigbanua lived in the abandoned ruins of the castle of [[Ito-jo]] in Wa, where they scavenged for carrion in the crypts.",
        "Notable Tigbanua Buso": "* [[Getsu]], an unusually intelligent tigbanua buso in Nakamaru.\n* A [[Tigbanua buso (wu jen)|human wu jen cursed to be a tigbanua buso]] in Wa.\n* [[Splin]], the pet tigbanua buso of a group of [[kappa]]s living along the [[River Hidden]], which led from [[Panchengjuduohuh]] in T'u Lung.<ref>"
