'''Planetars''' ({{Pronounce|PLAN|eh|tarz|refs= They were messengers of the gods

Planetars were known to be in service to the deities [[Deneir]] and [[Ilmater]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==Description==
A planetar usually appeared as a handsome, powerful, and muscular [[humanoid]] creature with opalescent emerald skin. They had opalescent white-feathered wings, stood between about 8 and 9 feet (2.4 to 2.7 meters) tall, and weighed about 500 pounds (230 kilograms). They were typically bald.

Not all planetars appeared like this, however. For example, the [[Shard]]s, the planetars in service to [[Selûne]] had long, flowing blue hair and pearly white skin.

==Abilities==
In addition to the magical powers common to all angels, planetars could pray for and cast [[divine magic]]al spells like the most powerful of [[cleric]]s. Beyond this, they had innate access to a wide range of powerful magics, for which they did not need to pray. These included but were not limited to the ability to [[Greater restoration|restore]] victims from ailments and [[Raise dead|raise the dead]]. They could create a [[Blade barrier|barrier of magical blades]], trigger a massive [[earthquake]], send [[waves of exhaustion]] over their enemies, [[Mass charm monster|charm large groups of monsters at the same time]], call down a [[flame strike|column of divine fire]], and [[Power word, stun|stun with only a single word]]. Several times per day they could [[Polymorph self|transform themselves into nearly any creature or object]]. They could [[commune]] directly with their deity. Whenever they desired, they could create a [[continual flame]] of light; [[Invisibility|turn invisible]]; [[Holy smite|smite fiends with a burst of holy power]]; [[remove curse]]s, [[Remove disease|diseases]], and [[Remove fear|fear]]; [[dispel magic]]; and even [[Speak with dead|speak with the dead]]. Planetars had [[Control weather|control over weather]] and could call down rain to quench a thirsty field or a [[Insect plague|plague of locusts]] to punish the wicked.

They bore all of the immunities and resistances of other angels and were surrounded by the same protective aura of good. Furthermore, they could only be permanently harmed by magically evil attacks; they could [[regenerate]] from any other injuries.

Planetars could [[Darkvision|see in the dark]] and in [[Low-light vision|low-light]], They could always sense when someone was lying.

The great wings of planetars allowed them to fly at great speeds with excellent maneuverability in the air.

Planetars, like all other angels, could use [[Tongues|magic to speak any language]]. They could also communicate telepathically within 100 feet (30 meters).

As with other [[aasimon]], planetars could not be permanently slain unless on their home [[Cosmology|plane]]. If their bodies were destroyed anywhere else, their life forces would return to their home plane, where their bodies would reform over a period of 40 years.

==Personality==
[[File:Planetar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A planetar slaying a fiend.'']]
All planetars were good. Their particular ethical bent depended on the deity that they served.

Planetars gave off a sense of strength and confidence. They inspired goodness in others by the power of their deeds, not their words.

Planetars loved battling [[fiends]] and slew every truly evil creature set in their path.

==Combat==
Despite their vast array of magical powers, planetars were more likely to wade into melee with their powerful, two-handed—especially with swords known as ''[[celestial blade]]s'', which glowed with radiant light and were engraved with the [[holy symbol]] of the deity that the planetar served. It was said that only a planetar could wield such a sword, which damaged enemies with holy radiance.

==Society==
Planetars, who numbered more than a hundred, and on other [[Upper Planes]].

As celestial stewards, planetars directly served the good deities. One or a few served as the right hand of a minor deity, while larger numbers served the major deities. They were only sent to other planes to aid the most powerful and faithful of their deities' servants. Only the most perilous of missions were assigned to them, such as rescuing a mortal cleric from the grips of a [[pit fiend]] or recovering a stolen [[artifact]] from the lair of an [[arcanaloth]]. On such missions, they usually acted alone.

A planetar succeeding at a mission had a small chance of being promoted to the status of a [[solar]].

==Physiology==
[[File:Resounding Justice.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The planetar known as [[Resounding Justice]] sacrificed herself to save the city of [[Archenbridge]] in the [[Dalelands]].'']]
As [[outsider]]s, planetars were not dependent upon their environment for survival.

On rare occasions where a planetar would take a mortal lover—which was known to have occurred in particular with some of Selûne's Shards—his or her [[aasimar]] descendants would often have emerald skin or the traces of white feathers at the shoulder, as evidence of the celestial heritage.

==Notable Planetars==
* [[Fazrian]], a fallen planetar who was called into [[Undermountain]] by an adventuring [[cleric]] of [[Torm]] but became obsessed with cleansing the corruption in the [[Terminus Level]] and fell from grace.
*[[Nascius]], a planetar trapped in [[The Companion]], a magical second sun hovering above the city of [[Elturel]].
* [[Resounding Justice]], a planetar sent by [[Tyr]] to battle [[Krysus Vaant]] and who also fought in the [[Procession of Justice]].
* The [[Shards]], a group of seven female planetars in service to [[Selûne]], who were composed of moonlight and fire.{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|135}}
