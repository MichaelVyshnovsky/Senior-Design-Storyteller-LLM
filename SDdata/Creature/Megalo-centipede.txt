Megalo-centipedes were a very rare species of monstrous centipede related to giant centipedes.
On average these insects grew to be around  in length, over  longer than some giant centipedes.
Megalo-centipedes were more intelligent and cunning than their smaller cousins.

In 1368 DR, megalo-centipedes could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep.
