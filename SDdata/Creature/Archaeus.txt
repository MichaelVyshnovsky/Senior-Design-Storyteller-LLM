Archaeus were a variety of fish found in the Sea of Moving Ice, most often around Icecrag Island.
Archaeological evidence conducted in the Present Age found that this creature, or at least one similar to it, had been around on Toril ever since prehistoric times. Because of this, scholars often referred to the archaeus as a "living fossil."
