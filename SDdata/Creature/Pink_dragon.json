        "mainbody": "'''Pink dragons''' were a very, very rare species of [[chromatic dragon]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-12-28/Pink dragons}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Pink dragons, true to their name, had a delicate pink coloration. They were often said to be \"dopey-looking\".",
        "Personality": "Pink dragons loved to talk and make jokes but, while not actually malevolent, were prone to eating those who didn't laugh at their jokes.",
        "Abilities": "Pink dragons lacked the fear-inducing aura of other true dragons and their innate magical abilities were erratic: only a little less than a quarter of pink dragons could cast [[spell]]s, always as [[illusionist]]s.\n\nPink dragons were best known for their unusual [[Dragon breath|breath weapon]]: a special gland in them mixed a fatty secretion with a lye-like liquid and the resulting goop came out as many, many bubbles, forming a cloud some {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} long, {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} wide, and {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} high. The [[soap]]-like substance was painful if it got into the eyes and the cloud overall effectively blinded those within it. The pain was also known to be sufficiently distracting as to render fighting impractical. Pink dragons were immune to their own breath weapon by virtue of a transparent third eyelid and [[bat]]-like sonar.",
        "Combat": "Despite their decidedly ridiculous appearance, pink dragons were quite dangerous in combat and many adventurers fatally underestimated them because of their coloring. Pink dragons typically used their breath weapon in combat before relying on their claws and teeth.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Reproduction": "Pink dragons, like other true dragons, could breed with other dragon species, but they were very picky about who they mated with, refusing vain or aggressive suitors. Moreover, the majority of the time, the hatchlings of such mixed unions were of the other species- the innate magic of the pink dragon had to \"come alive\" while the eggs were forming internally for the hatchlings to be pink dragons. Clutches with a pink dragon parent normally contained one, but could be up to three, eggs."
        },
        "Notable pink dragons": "*[[Galahlahothlor]] - an adult female living in the easternmost peaks of the mountains flanking southern [[Raurin]].\n*[[Mahront]] - an adult male living in \"the Maw\", a large cavern on the eastern face of the [[Nountfang]] in the [[Greypeak Mountains]].\n*[[Meeiarrora]] - an ancient female living under [[Mount Urelhond]] in [[Narfell]].\n*[[Pelarrand]] - an adult male believed by the sage [[Halvaerand Beltorn]] of [[Lushpool]] to the be same individual as that seen by the people of [[Sammaresh]] hunting over the [[Mhair Jungles]], though other sages rejected this as mere conjecture.\n*[[Sazeztlorund]] - a young male living in the caves under [[Azirrhat]] in [[Anauroch]]."
