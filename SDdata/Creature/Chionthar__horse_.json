        "mainbody": "he Chionthar, also known as the Reaching or Cormyte riding horse, was a popular light steed from the Chionthar Valley in the Western Heartlands. Although they were most commonly found in their home region, they were also abundantly bred in the Eastern Heartlands.\nHighly valued by travelers and couriers, especially for their easy-to-train temperament. The Chionthar could be bought from quality ranchers in a number of cities including Arabel, Harrowdale and Waymoot in central Faer√ªn, or Asbravn, Hluthvar and Iriaebor in the Western Heartlands. The average price for a steed was 200 gp.\nThis breed was particularly strong and swift for its size. It had a long neck and regal-looking head with a face and eyes that exhibited notable intelligence.\nThe Chionthar was originally bred in the Vilhon Reach, influenced heavily by its Calimite and Dambraii forebears. Despite their origins on the southern coasts of the Sea of Fallen Stars, the Chionthar was perfected as a breed in Cormyr."
