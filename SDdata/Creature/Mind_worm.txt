Mind worms were powerful psionic creatures thought to be the result of illithid experimentation.
Mind worms were massive, worm-like creatures (generally compared to purple worms in shape) some  in diameter,  in length, and  in weight. Their skin was a nasty, sickly, pale purple color.
Mind worms had both formidable physical abilities and powerful psionic talents. They had both darkvision and blindsense, were immune to the effects of acid and mental attacks, and were resistant to spells they could also swallow creatures whole or unleash a blast of psionic power in a  cone. Mind worms could also use the psionic powers of greater scrying and plane shift at will.
Perhaps their most significant and deadly ability, however, was that they could create "probe worms" a tiny, worm-like construct of psionic energy, which a mind worm could have up to four active and could create out of any fluid or reflective surface they could sense- even through scrying. Probe worms could physically attack creatures up to  away from the surface they originated from, and- on a particularly lucky or precise strike- could allow a mind worm to use a linked ability that let them psionically transport the victim into its stomach. Probe worms could also induce fear in creatures they attacked.
Mind worms preferred to attack enemies with their probes worms rather than face them directly, and typically targeted obvious spellcaster first. If confronted physically, a mind worm would seek to retreat back into water.
Mind worms were solitary creatures that lived in subterranean, aquatic habitats. They were sometimes utilized by illithids as assassins and bounty hunters.
Quite unlike purple worms, mind worms were highly intelligent and capable of speech they were recorded to speak Undercommon, albeit in a disturbing, gurgling voice.
