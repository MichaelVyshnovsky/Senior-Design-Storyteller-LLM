        "mainbody": "erroliths, also called iron demons or Handmaidens of Pain, were a type of demon that resembled metallic succubi.\nFerroliths resembled succubi in form, but lacked that types beauty and were instead covered in metal. Even their hair was like razor-sharp wires.\nFerroliths lacked the innate magical abilities common to most demons, but the metal on their bodies was incredibly hard and formed razor-sharp claws and fangs.\nFerroliths almost always fought in melee combat. When fighting in groups, they went for the strongest targets first when fighting alone, they would go for the softest target first.\nFerroliths were native to the Abyss, where they crawled out of pools of molten iron fully formed. Although some ferroliths were known to work for Grazzt, they did so only because of powerful magic binding them to him. All ferroliths hated the Dark Prince and would gladly ally with any creature that opposed him.\nLike the succubi they were descended from, ferroliths enjoyed subterfuge and scheming, and possessed an incredible natural cunning.\nFerroliths first came into being when Grazzt learned of a plot by some succubi to betray him. In retribution, he cast them into pools of molten abyssal iron, which seared and then bonded to their bodies. When they crawled out, they had become the first ferroliths.\nOne particularly powerful ferrolith who called herself the Iron Maiden seized a small fortress made of broken swords on the Plain of Infinite Portals and began to send emissaries to the Nine Hells in hopes of forging an alliance against Grazzt."
