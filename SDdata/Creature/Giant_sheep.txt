'''Giant sheep''', also known as '''giant rams''' in the case of males, were a rare species of larger than usual [[sheep]].

==Description==
The average giant sheep, regardless of sex, grew to be around {{SI|6|ft}} tall at the shoulder.

==Behavior==
Much like their smaller cousins, giant sheep were largely non-aggressive creatures. However, if they believed their flock was threatened, they would fight the perceived threat to the death.

==Combat==
Giant rams charged at their enemies, ramming them with their horns.

==Ecology==
Giant sheep lived in flocks. At the very least, these consisted of one ram, four ewes, and a number of lambs.

===Habitats===
These creatures primarily inhabited hilly or mountainous regions.

In the Realms they could be particularly found inhabiting the [[Omlarandin Mountains]], east of [[Saradush]],{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|54}} as well as in the highlands and coniferous forests of the [[Moonshae Isles]].

===Relationships===
Some [[cyclopes]] were known to herd giant sheep. In the Omlarandin Mountains, some [[mountain giant]]s were also known to herd them.

Giant sheep were a [[favored animal]] of the [[halfling]] [[deity]] [[Yondalla]].

===Usage===
The horn of a giant ram could be used as a [[material component]] for the [[spell]] ''[[horn of plenty]]''.

==Trivia==
A giant ram could be summoned by the ''[[conjure animals]]'' spell.<ref>
