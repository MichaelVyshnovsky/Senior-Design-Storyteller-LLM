Giant sheep, also known as giant rams in the case of males, were a rare species of larger than usual sheep.
The average giant sheep, regardless of sex, grew to be around  tall at the shoulder.
Much like their smaller cousins, giant sheep were largely non-aggressive creatures. However, if they believed their flock was threatened, they would fight the perceived threat to the death.
Giant rams charged at their enemies, ramming them with their horns.
Giant sheep lived in flocks. At the very least, these consisted of one ram, four ewes, and a number of lambs.
These creatures primarily inhabited hilly or mountainous regions.
In the Realms they could be particularly found inhabiting the Omlarandin Mountains, east of Saradush, as well as in the highlands and coniferous forests of the Moonshae Isles.
Some cyclopes were known to herd giant sheep. In the Omlarandin Mountains, some mountain giants were also known to herd them.
Giant sheep were a favored animal of the halfling deity Yondalla.
The horn of a giant ram could be used as a material component for the spell horn of plenty.
A giant ram could be summoned by the conjure animals spell.
