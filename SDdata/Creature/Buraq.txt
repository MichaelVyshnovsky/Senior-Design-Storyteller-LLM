'''Buraqs''', or '''horses of heaven''', were companions of princes and sultans, and helpers for many holy warriors. 

==Description==
Externally they resembled a horse with a long tail and a human face. In size, they were larger than [[donkey]]s, but smaller than [[mule]]s. Their tails were red, blue, green or gold. Their hooves had magical properties that allowed them to move very quietly even at full gallop.

Buraqs were also great travelers. Able to move on any terrain, day and night, and navigate by star, but they could not cross oceans. They could move through the air at the same rate as sprinting on the ground, but they needed to take a good running start. Riders upon a buraq experienced the trip as an instantaneous event. This was explained by the buraq's ability to stop time. Buraqs often uses this ability to help people.

At will buraqs could ''[[speak with animals]]'' and learn three languages ​​per day.

==Combat==
Though they detested combat, buraqs could serve as warhorses. They preferred giving army command and staying out of the battle.

If forced to fight, a buraq could use their hooves to cause significant damage to enemies. 

==Society==
These free creatures had no master.  
===Diet===
Buraqs could live completely without food, sustaining themselves on kindness. Therefore, a companion with a pure heart provided all the sustenance they required.
===Relationships===
Buraqs were friends to the faithful and worthy, but this friendship was not so easily to earn. People could spend their entire lives doing good deeds, caring for a buraq (currying, combing, braiding its mane), and showing courage and generosity. It was a hard life to choose for most people, but the rewards were truly enormous. Anyone earning  the trust of a buraq became his master. Masters of buraqs were living legends. They lived for centuries and moved around the world at the speed of thought. However, it was very easy to lose a buraq's respect if they strayed from their honest ways.
