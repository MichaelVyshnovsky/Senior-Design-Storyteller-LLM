        "Description": "They were a subspecies of nishruu and found in the [[Old Empires]] of [[Mulhorand]], [[Unther]], and [[Chessenta]]. They were identical with nishruus in almost every way except for their appearance.\n\nHakeashars had hundreds of grasping claws, piercing eyes and outstretched fanged mouths among the globular blood-red mist. Thus, hakeashars had a more horrific appearance and thus naturally could fill their foes with horror.",
        "Combat": "Hakeashars were slightly more powerful than their nishruu cousins: they had more powerful attacks, higher health, and immunity to standard weapons. Thus, it required a more powerful mage to summon one."
