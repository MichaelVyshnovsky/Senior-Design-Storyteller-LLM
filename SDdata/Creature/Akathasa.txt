'''Akathasa''', also known as the '''Servants of the Tamara''', was a species of parasitic [[imp]]s that served the planar evil called the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]] that threatened the [[Malatran Plateau]].

==Description==
Akathasa were tiny creatures that varied in sizes from {{SI|0'6|'"|long=yes}} to {{SI|2'|'"|long=yes}} with the wingspan being double of their body length.{{Cite living jungle/Forgotten Father|7-8}}

==Abilities==
Akathasa shared a telepathic link with all members of their swarm, allowing them to act as one and communicate instantaneously. They could also sense all warm-blooded creatures within {{SI|60'|'"|long=yes}}.

==Combat==
Cowardly creatures by nature, akathasa preferred spying and observing, avoiding combat when possible, hiding in shadows, and often retreating after belching a ''[[stinking cloud]]'' on their opponents. Akathasa could erucate ''stinking gases'' twice per day, but when desperate, they resorted to swarming and biting their opponents.

==Ecology==
Akathasa were carnivorous parasitic creatures native to [[Tartarus]]. They could often be found as solitary spies or as swarming flocks of up to fifty imps. Tamara were linked with their little spies, able to see and hear everything akathasa did. When they fed, often on [[garuda]] of the Malatran Plateau, akathasa swarmed their giant scaly bodies, living or dead, consuming blood.

It was believed that the Tamare created plant monstrosities called [[lokesti]] that, in turn, spawned akathasa.{{Cite living jungle/Promises: Jus Post Bellum|10}}

==History==
In the Year of Great Change ([[1373 DR]]){{LJ}}, akathasa were visually unknown to the inhabitants of the [[Living Jungle]]. [[Uubaar]], a [[tiger katanga]] discovered the elusive creatures after they were unleashed on the jungle by the Tamara. A group of heroes of the Living Jungle were guided by Uubaar to a swarm of akathasa who were feeding on a dead [[stegosaurus]] not far from the ruined home of the [[Forgotten Father (Nubari)|Forgotten Father]]. The Servants of the Tamara were unleashed on the [[Jungle of Lost Tribes]] and took over the region.

Akathasa were part of the war with the tribes of the Living Jungle when Tamara entered the Prime Material plane, along with the Tiger. Subsequently, the outsiders were defeated, and most of akathasa were hunted down and killed.{{Cite living jungle/Day of the Saru: Part I|10}}
