'''Greaseballs''' were a rare variety of an [[ooze]] that could be summoned to the [[Prime Material plane]] by some [[mage]]s alongside [[grease mephit]]s and [[grease elemental]]s.

==Description==
Like other ooze creatures, greaseballs were living organisms made entirely out of grease and resembled blobs of pulsating slick oily mass. They possessed low animal-like intelligence and could perform only the simplest tasks when compelled by their summoners.

==Abilities==
Greaseballs were slow-moving creatures that left a thick coat of grease behind as they moved, similar to the effects of the ''[[grease]]'' [[spell]]. The grease secretions were highly flammable and the creatures' own bodies were highly vulnerable to fire. However, they were resistant to slashing and electricity.

In battle, they simply slammed at their opponents with pseudopods.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the mad sewer-dwelling grease-mage named [[Aelis Siryasius]] inhabited the [[sewers of Baldur's Gate]]. His small patch of sewers was infested with a small army of grease mephits, grease elementals, and greaseballs.
