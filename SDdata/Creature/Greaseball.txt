Greaseballs were a rare variety of an ooze that could be summoned to the Prime Material plane by some mages alongside grease mephits and grease elementals.
Like other ooze creatures, greaseballs were living organisms made entirely out of grease and resembled blobs of pulsating slick oily mass. They possessed low animal-like intelligence and could perform only the simplest tasks when compelled by their summoners.
Greaseballs were slow-moving creatures that left a thick coat of grease behind as they moved, similar to the effects of the grease spell. The grease secretions were highly flammable and the creatures own bodies were highly vulnerable to fire. However, they were resistant to slashing and electricity.
In battle, they simply slammed at their opponents with pseudopods.
