        "Description": "Gendruwo were able to shape-shift at will and were able to take on many appearances. Their natural form was a humanoid with no distinguishing features.",
        "Combat": "Like all memedi, gendruwo detested all combat. However, unlike other memedi, if confronted, a gendruwo would defend itself, even wielding a weapon if one was available. They considered the use of weapons demeaning and would dispose of it as soon as possible.",
        "Abilities": "If a human saw a gendruwo, they were struck with effects similar to that of a ''[[fear]]'' spell. Gendruwo had significant resistance to magic but were vulnerable to spells that affected [[spirit]]s.",
        "Society": "Gendruwo were infamous for their pranks. They relished in annoying [[human]]s and most often pulled relatively harmless pranks. But if a gendruwo was in a bad mood, their pranks were more malicious. \n\nTheir most dangerous prank was kidnapping. They lured a victim with the promise of food such as [[kastera]]. The gendruwo then grabbed their target and transported them both to the edges of the [[Ethereal Plane]]. The grasp of a gendruwo was unbreakable so the victim was helpless. Upon arriving in the Ethereal Plane, the gendruwo released their victim and returned to the [[Prime Material Plane]], leaving their victim behind, who had to find their own way back to their previous location. \n\nGendruwo were solitary creatures but sometimes worked in a group to pull off an elaborate prank.",
        "Habitat": "Gendruwo were native to the Ethereal Plane and were most often encountered in Kara-Tur, usually on the island of [[Bawa]] and other islands within the [[Island Kingdoms]]. They had no lair and preferred secluded locations.",
        "Ecology": "Unlike other memedi, gendruwo consumed beverages and food, as well as [[paper]] and [[parchment]]."
