Although they werent so intelligent, they still gathered valuable magical items.\nMargoyles would often surprise their opponents, as they seemed so much like stone. They attacked with their claws and their pair of horns and bit with their fangs. They could only be damaged by magical weapons.\nKapoacinth margoyle An aquatic variant of margoyle similar to kapoacinths.\nMargoyles were mainly found in natural caves and caverns. They were able to speak the language of gargoyles, but they also had their own language."
