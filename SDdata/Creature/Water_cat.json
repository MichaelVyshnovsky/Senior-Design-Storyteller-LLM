        "mainbody": "'''Water cats''' were a rare species of [[feline]] with an affinity for water that were descended from the cat [[familiar]]s of [[wizard]]s{{Cite dragon/238/The Dragon's Bestiary: Spawn of the Sewers|72}}{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stars Don't Lie|10}} and [[sorcerer]]s, who fled into a [[sewer]] system after their masters were slain by [[necromancer]]s and became warped by [[magic]]al pollution that was within the system.",
        "Behavior": "Though they were wild animals, water cats had a benign nature, retaining their ancestors' strong affinity towards [[humans]] and [[demihuman]]s as well as an affinity towards magic. Some stories even spoke of them guiding people who were lost in a sewer system back to the surface.\n\nWater cats possessed a greater level of intellect than domestic cats. And as their name suggested, unlike many cats the species had no qualms with getting themselves wet and swimming.",
        "Abilities": "The most pronounced difference between water cats and domestic cats was their fangs. These were hollow, much like the fangs of a [[serpent]], and carried a unique form of [[poison]] that they injected with any bite. For rodents or rodent-like creatures, such as [[wererat]]s, this poison could simply be fatal. For demihumans, humans, and [[humanoid]]s this poison had an initial effect similar to the spell ''[[ray  of enfeeblement]]'', which could potentially be followed by the victim's body gradually transforming into a [[mongrelfolk]] over a period of one month.",
        "Combat": {
            "Ecology": "These felines were an elusive species, doing their best to hide themselves from other creatures at large. Outside of mating they rarely interacted with other members of their species.",
            "Habitats": "These creatures were typically found in and around bodies of water, such as in the sewers of a city{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stars Don't Lie|9}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"unnamed\">A name is never given in ''The Stars Don't Lie'' for the swamp that the players travel through in the adventure, but it's stated to be quite large and within six days of travel from Ravens Bluff. As there is no other significant swamp known to be proximity to the city, the Flooded Forest is most likely the location.",
            "Diet": "Water cats were a carnivorous species. They primarily preyed upon small mammals, such as [[mice]], [[rat]]s, and [[giant rat]]s. They would occasionally act as scavengers, nibbling upon the corpses of much larger creatures that they came across.",
            "Languages": "The majority of water cats spoke the same language as animal language as cats, though due to their familiar ancestry a few naturally understood [[Common]].",
            "Relationships": "Water cats had a noticeable effect upon the ecosystem of any sewer system they lived in, cutting down the local population of giant rats and rats. Their skillful hunting could cause rodents to eventually flee their sewer to find somewhere else on the surface to live. If managed to be caught, they could be domesticated and used as a rodent deterrent."
