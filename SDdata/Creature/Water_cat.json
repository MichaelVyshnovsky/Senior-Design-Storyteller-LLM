        "mainbody": "Water cats were a rare species of feline with an affinity for water that were descended from the cat familiars of wizards and sorcerers, who fled into a sewer system after their masters were slain by necromancers and became warped by magical pollution that was within the system.\nThough they were wild animals, water cats had a benign nature, retaining their ancestors strong affinity towards humans and demihumans as well as an affinity towards magic. Some stories even spoke of them guiding people who were lost in a sewer system back to the surface.\nWater cats possessed a greater level of intellect than domestic cats. And as their name suggested, unlike many cats the species had no qualms with getting themselves wet and swimming.\nThe most pronounced difference between water cats and domestic cats was their fangs. These were hollow, much like the fangs of a serpent, and carried a unique form of poison that they injected with any bite. For rodents or rodent-like creatures, such as wererats, this poison could simply be fatal. For demihumans, humans, and humanoids this poison had an initial effect similar to the spell ray  of enfeeblement, which could potentially be followed by the victims body gradually transforming into a mongrelfolk over a period of one month.\nWater cats fought in much the same manner as domestic cats, using their claws and teeth.\nThese felines were an elusive species, doing their best to hide themselves from other creatures at large. Outside of mating they rarely interacted with other members of their species.\nThese creatures were typically found in and around bodies of water, such as in the sewers of a cityA name is never given in The Stars Dont Lie for the swamp that the players travel through in the adventure, but its stated to be quite large and within six days of travel from Ravens Bluff. As there is no other significant swamp known to be proximity to the city, the Flooded Forest is most likely the location.\nWater cats were a carnivorous species. They primarily preyed upon small mammals, such as mice, rats, and giant rats. They would occasionally act as scavengers, nibbling upon the corpses of much larger creatures that they came across.\nThe majority of water cats spoke the same language as animal language as cats, though due to their familiar ancestry a few naturally understood Common.\nWater cats had a noticeable effect upon the ecosystem of any sewer system they lived in, cutting down the local population of giant rats and rats. Their skillful hunting could cause rodents to eventually flee their sewer to find somewhere else on the surface to live. If managed to be caught, they could be domesticated and used as a rodent deterrent."
