        "mainbody": "'''Mercury dragons''' were whimsical, impulsive [[metallic dragon]]s that delighted in unpredictability and were reputed to be mentally unstable as well.",
        "Description": "Mercury dragons had sleek and serpentine bodies with a whip-like tail, lacking the muscular bulk other dragon races had. They had sleek heads with a long, pointed snout, and with horns curving backward from behind their jaws and eyes.\n\nMercury dragons were quick and agile flyers, and they had smooth, flat, barely discernible silver-white scales that seem to flow together as one. While at birth their scales were dull silver in hue, as a mercury dragon got older its scales became brighter, until they became as brilliant as a mirror. Likewise, their eyes were deep blue or violet with a dark pupil and a pale yellow-white iris in their younger years, but as they got older, their pupils became paler and brighter, their eyes resembling silver orbs.\n\nWhile mercury dragons had no venomous attacks, their breath weapons and flesh were highly poisonous.",
        "Personality": {
            "Treasure": "A mercury dragon's hoard was a hodgepodge of [[currency|coins]], jewelry, and items from scores of lands and dozens of eras, as mercury dragons weren't good at assembling matched sets or cohesive collections. They were often willing to exchange something from their hoards for some items they had heard about but never seen, especially when they were trading away a duplicate."

        "Combat": {
            "Breath weapon": "Mercury dragons could breathe a line of intense light that burned whatever it touched. rendering a mercury dragon invisible to its victims. Mercury dragons usually boasted while hidden after using their breath weapons.",
            "Abilities": "Mercury dragons had the ability to turn into a liquid quicksilver form, allowing them to move across any kind of terrain. They also were immune to any effects that affected their sight.\n\nThey also had the ability to cast both [[arcane]] and [[divine]] [[spell]]s."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Lairs": "Mercury dragons liked to lair in warm, volcanic ranges and tropical regions, preferring to dwell near snowfields, glaciers, mountain lakes, sun-dappled alpine meadows, and places that had portals to the Elemental Chaos, a place they liked because of its ever-changing nature. They made their lairs in lava tubes and other narrow, winding tunnels or high caves, preferring those that allowed them to enjoy clear air and bright sunlight, and their lairs usually faced east to catch the morning sun. However, few mercury dragons maintained a single lair for any length of time.",
            "Homelands": "In [[Faer√ªn]], mercury dragons were most common in the mountain ranges along the southern shores of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars|Inner Sea]], from the [[Giant's Run Mountains]] to the [[Smoking Mountains]]. Favored places included the [[Arnrock]] in the [[Lake of Steam]], [[Mount Ugruth]] (near [[Hlondeth]]), and the Smoking Mountains.",
            "Relationships": "Mercury dragons were a [[favored monster]] of the [[deities]] [[Eilistraee]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Hanali Celanil]], and [[Brandobaris]]."
