        "Description": "Forest trolls had a long and thin frame and were usually between six and six and a half feet tall (between 1.8 and 2.0 meters), but some could reach heights of 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall. They had skinny arms with three fingers, ending in long sharp claws. The trolls had a rubbery skin of a putrid grayish-green color and their eyes glowed a fierce red. Their foul odor precedes them. Their faces were adorned with a long nose and they had long pointy teeth.\n\nLike all trolls, forest trolls had the power to regenerate any wounds, their rubbery skin mending of its own accord. Detached limbs were seen wriggling trying to reattach to the torso. Thus, these trolls could take an incredible amount of punishment before falling down. But even a troll that had been cut into pieces would in due time come back to life unless its wounds had been completely burned.",
        "Combat": "Their long arms are their weapons, the trolls wave them awkwardly in wide, arcing swipes clawing at everyone in their reach.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Forest trolls were known to inhabit the [[Chondalwood]], where they were known as '''muskwarts''' because of the warts that produced their horrible, eye-burning odor."
