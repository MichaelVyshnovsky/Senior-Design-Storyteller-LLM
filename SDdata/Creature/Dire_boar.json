As well as the land of Chult. In Anauroch, they could occasionally be found in the fertile areas of the Plain of Standing Stones.\nSome humanoid races were known to domesticate dire boars, such as orcs, gray orcs, and dwarves, the latter of which referred to their dire boar mounts as \"thundertusks.\" However, domestication was a difficult process, and after being domesticated dire boars were still known to be quite fierce and dangerous.\n* Balalak, a giant dire boar that terrorized the jungles of Samarach in the Chultan Peninsula circa 1374 DR.\n* Bristlebeard\nDire boars were a favored animal of the deity Bahgtru."
