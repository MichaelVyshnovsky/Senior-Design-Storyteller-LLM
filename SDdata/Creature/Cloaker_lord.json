        "mainbody": "'''Cloaker lords''' were a larger and more powerful subrace of [[cloaker]]s,",
        "Description": "A cloaker lord looked like a regular cloaker, except much larger. They were [[bat]]-like creatures that bore a resemblance to massive black [[cloak]]s, approximately the size that a [[giant]] might wear. When unfurled, they revealed a white underside with red eyes and a mouth filled with sharp fangs. They could flap their bodies as wings, with each \"wing\" ending in sharp claws. They had muscular, [[whip]]-like tails with a sharp bony barb at the tip. \n\nWhile cloaker lords aged and could get old,  and were capable of growing even larger as they aged, some [[dwarf|dwarven]] scholars believed that they nevertheless might exist outside the flow of time.",
        "Abilities": "A cloaker lord could emit an unearthly subsonic moan whenever it wished (assuming it did not have something in its mouth, of course). This moan had various negative effects on any creature that could hear it, ranging from being nauseated to being frightened or unnerved to being paralyzed. The cloaker lord could change the effect by changing the pitch and volume of its moan.\n\nThey further possessed the innate ability to cast a wide range of spells, and could do so solely with [[verbal component]]s. Their [[magic]]al repetoire only expanded as they grew in size, and they largely specialized in [[illusion]] and [[shadow magic]] which increased their options for crippling enemies or increasing their mobility. On top of this, they had a strong connection to the [[Shadowfell]], giving them the innate power to manipulate shadows as well as the power to breach the barrier between the [[Prime Material plane]] and the Shadowfell, allowing them to summon lesser [[:Category:Shadow creatures|shadow creatures]] and to ''[[plane shift]]'' between the two planes once each day.\n\nCloaker lords had an innate power to ''[[Dominate monster|dominate]]'' lesser cloakers to their will.",
        "Personality": "Backed by their innate powers of domination, cloaker lords ruled over other cloakers, and were the only force that could bring the aberrant creatures together. \n\nCloaker lords were more aggressive than normal cloakers, but not reckless.",
        "Combat": "A cloaker lord always began a battle with its eerie moan to cripple or scatter its foes, and would use its ability to manipulate shadows to obscure its enemies' vision, create distracting [[silent image|illusion]]s, and conjure ''[[mirror image]]s'' of itself.. It then moved in to wrap its body around an individual enemy, engulfing the target to restict its movement and then tearing at the trapped victim with its fangs. In this position, it could also sap the blood from the victim through its skin, and ultimately consume the creature entirely save for its bones. As it feasted, the cloaker lord would fend off other enemies with its barbed tail. When faced with many enemies, a cloaker lord preferred to target [[wizards]] first.\n\nTheir alien minds gave them great resistance to most mind-affecting magic and [[psionics]], especially if the user of these powers was unfamiliar with cloaker lords' thinking and behavior.",
        "Society": {
            "Conclave of Shadows": "In settlements led by multiple cloaker lords, these ruling lords would periodically merge their bodies to form a massive living ring or sphere of [[shadowstuff]] known as a '''Conclave of Shadows'''. In this state, not only their bodies but their minds blended together, which allowed them to share their thoughts in order to quickly come to unanimous decisions. Once a Conclave ended and the cloaker lords returned to their original bodies, they did so with a consensus about what needed to be done, and they went forth to act on the Convlave's decisions. A Conclave of Shadows tended to only come together sporadically or when fast decision-making was required.\n\nThe [[Shadoworb Conclave]] of Rringlor Noroth was perhaps the most notable Conclave of Shadows in [[Faerûn]]."
        },
        "History": "Like regular cloakers, cloaker lords were thought to have their origins in the [[Plane of Shadow]].{{Cite dragon/213/The Demiplane of Shadow|24-25}} While cloakers had long been known in Faerûn, cloaker lords&mdash;and the organized communities of cloakers that formed around them&mdash;were first encountered just a few centuries before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] Scholars remained unsure whether cloaker lords were new arrivals or had simply avoided revealing themselves prior to that time. \n\nPrior to the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, cloaker lords were not widely known for their spellcasting abilities, but they began to exhibit stronger and stronger powers as a result of an apparently deepening connection to the Plane of Shadow.",
        "Notable Cloaker Lords": "*During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, a cloaker lord drew together a small force of cloakers and enslaved [[deepspawn]] to claim some of the caverns near [[Menzoberranzan]].\n*Twelve cloaker lords, known collectively as the [[Shadoworb Conclave]], ruled the cloaker \"city\" of Rringlor Noroth.\n*A cloaker lord named [[Eeeyrith]] established itself as a leader of cloakers and a cultivator of various monsters within the [[Lost Ways]] beneath the [[West Galena Mountains]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/Lost Ways}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some scholars believed that cloaker lords were simply very ancient cloakers."
