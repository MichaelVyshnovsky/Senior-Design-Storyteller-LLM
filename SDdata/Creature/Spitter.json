Their mouth was filled with sharpened teeth. Their bumpy ridged bodies were usually green in color. They typically measured  in length.\nSpitters survived by consuming any liquids they stumbled across.\nIf threatened, a spitter attempted to bite or spit pellets of water that bludgeoned its attacker."
