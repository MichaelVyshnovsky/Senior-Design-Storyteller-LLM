        "mainbody": "'''Spirits of the air''' were a type of [[spirit]] that solely existed to serve the [[deities]] that commanded the wind and [[air]], most of whom were elemental in nature.",
        "Description": "These spirits resembled [[monkey]]s, but stood {{SIrange|8|10|ft|long=yes}} tall. They had long, prehensile tails. Their fingers were elongated, forming the ribs of their wings, which some likened to the wings of a [[bat]]. They also had clawed feet and sported two tusks that curled up towards their nose, then out towards their cheeks. Their tusked mouths always had a merry expression.\n\nSpirits of the air were born into the world with a white coloration. During the day, as their bodies soaked in the rays of the sun they became very colorful, sort of blond. But during the night, under the light of the moon, their colors would wash away and leave them with a coloration that was either black or dark brown.\n\nThey typically dressed in brilliant, shining fabric that was ever-shifting in hue and greater than most [[silk]] or [[spider]] thread.",
        "Personality": "These spirits had an average level of intelligence. They were fierce in their desire to serve and obey their masters, incapable of refusing orders,but were not by nature aggressive. When not serving deities they lived carefree, reveling in the sheer joy of flight.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Magic": "Spirits of air possessed an array of [[spell]]-like abilities. At will they could cast ''[[call lightning]]'' and ''[[detect magic]]''. Once per day they could cast ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[control weather]]'', ''[[whirlwind]]'', and ''[[wind walk]]''.\n\nIn addition to their innate abilities, there were a number of [[divine magic|divine]] spells of the [[Air domain|Air]] and [[Luck domain|Luck]] [[divine domain|domains]] that spirits of the air could cast. These included the following:\n:''[[aid]]'', ''[[animal messenger]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[create water]]'', ''[[cure minor wounds]]'', ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[divine favor]]'', ''[[enthrall]]'', ''[[entropic shield]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', ''[[invisibility purge]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[magic vestment]]'', ''[[protection from elements]]'', ''[[resistance]]'', ''[[summon monster I]]'', ''[[summon monster IV]]'', ''[[virtue]]'', and ''[[wind wall]]''.",
            "Death": "When a spirit of the air died their body released all the colors that it had built up in life as an array of arcing rainbows. Bright, merry and playful [[imp]]-like beings would also be released by their rainbows, whose existence would last for no more than an hour or two. These creatures could not be commanded or trapped by any means. They lacked knowledge of the world and spoke in a rapid, high-pitched gibbering manner."
        },
        "Combat": "These creatures fought with their clawed feet, teeth, and wings. They also fought with wide range of weaponry that typically included [[dart]]s, [[longbow]]s, [[two-handed sword]]s, and [[footman's mace]]s, and ''+1 [[heavy mace]]s''. They sometimes held these weapons with their tails.\n\nWith the exception of the last one, the weapons they fought with were not enchanted, but rather imbued with the might of the deity they served. This allowed them to injure any creature that could only be harmed by ''+3 or greater'' enchanted weapons. When other creatures tried to wield their weapons they would function mundanely.\n\nWhen engaged in combat a spirit of the air almost never allowed its feet to touch the ground. They always fought with their spell-like abilities before moving in for close quarters combat. They were also skilled at fighting against airborne enemies.",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], some spirits of the air were being commanded by the evil [[sorcerer]] [[Opawang]] on behalf of their master in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]. During that time they resided within the mountains of [[Akari|Akari Island]].",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "",
            "Homelands": "Spirits of the air could be found throughout the [[Upper Planes]], the [[neutral]]-aligned [[plane]]s, They claimed windy areas as their territories and were generally seen in the upper part of atmospheres, near windy mountaintops, or near the windswept plains of lowlands. Due to their remarkable mobility, the territory for spirits of air could sometimes stretch for hundreds of miles\n\nIn [[Prime Material plane]], these creatures were only commonly encountered in the land of [[Kara-Tur]].",
            "Languages": "Spirits of the air were capable of speaking [[Auran]], the [[Draconic language]], and the [[Giant language]].",
            "Relationships": "Spirits of the air served deities that commanded the air and wind regardless of their [[alignment]]. In some cases they even served non-deific powers that dealt in those same areas,{{Cite dragon/353/Princes of Elemental Good|47}}\n\nAny god who could create and control the wind could create and control one of these creatures. The deities that these spirits served were capable of summoning up to a hundred of them each day. They served as either messengers of full-on proxies."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to an ancient legend, when the gods first made the [[multiverse]], they looked upon their work knowing that it was complete, yet incomplete. The only thing left for it was for it to be destroyed, the final inevitability that would mark it as \"complete\". Believing themselves to be omniscient, they regarded this fact with happiness and sadness, but their hubris proved the undoing of their work's \"finished\" state. Their speech had given life to the air around them, and before it could be stopped the words took shape, coalescing into small, silvery entities that mocked their parents' pride.\n\nAngered at their disrespect, the gods drew back in some of the life they had accidentally given, binding the spirits to their will. So it was that the spirits of the air, despite their generally free existence and adherence to no one deity, would forever hear the rhythmic breathing of the wind gods, forced to carry out the secret instructions given to them in a divine sigh lest the breath of creation that made them be re-inhaled."
