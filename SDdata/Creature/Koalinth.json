        "mainbody": "Koalinths, also known as sea hobgoblins were a savage undersea race which  inhabited the Inner Sea.\nKoalinths were similar to hobgoblins in appearance, but were very brightly colored and possessed gills.\nKoalinth were known for a great ferocity similar to that of normal hobgoblins. They held a strong hatred of elves, deep enough to affect their decisions to forge alliances.\nUnlike the majority of aquatic races, koalinths were equally able to breath freshwater and saltwater without difficulty.\nKoalinth were as diligent in matters of warfare as their land-dwelling cousins. They shared their martial skill and ability to see in the dark. They were amphibious but normally moved slower in the water than they did on land. Like many seafaring races, they wielded tridents so as to better fight in aquatic settings.\nKoalinth sergeants focused on the most crucial battlefield threats. They were faster underwater than other koalinths and used hooked nets to capture important enemies, and were especially skilled in putting down these foes when restrained.\nLike normal hobgoblins, koalinth society was highly structured and militaristic. Koalinth lairs were located in underwater sea caverns, grottoes, and shallow fresh water caves. Koalinth societies were run by chiefs and subchiefs with shamans beneath them. Sergeants conducted routine military operations with normal koalinth soldiers.\nKoalinths spoke theirÂ own distinct dialect of the Hobgoblin tongue.\nSome koalinths made use of guard beasts, using giant crayfish in freshwater and sea lions in salt water. Though they preyed upon many aquatic humanoids and demihumans, they especially detested aquatic elves.\nSome acted as servants of the marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls."
