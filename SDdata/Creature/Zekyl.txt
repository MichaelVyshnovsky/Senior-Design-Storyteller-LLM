The '''''zekyl''''' ({{Plural|zekylyn}}; {{Gender|f|zebeyl}}, {{Plural|zebylyn}}{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}}) or [[half-dragon|half]]–[[shadow dragon]] [[drow]], were an offshoot of the drow race.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|4}}

==Abilities==
A ''zekyl'' had the abilities of a [[drow]] and of a [[half-dragon]] of [[shadow dragon]] patronage. They had the good natural dexterity of normal drow, but their dragon blood erased the drow's physical frailty. It also made them significantly stronger, and enhanced their already keen intellect and charisma.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|4-6}}

Being drow [[elves]] gave them good resistance against [[magic]] that affected their will and against [[enchantment]] in general, protection against [[spell]]s and an immunity to sleep magic. Their dragon side provided them with an outright immunity against being paralyzed and draining of energy and a thick hide to protect against physical attacks. They had claws and a bite usable in combat. 

Like any other drow, they had [[darkvision]], but also gained [[low-light vision]]. They could create ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', and ''[[darkness]]'' each once a day. 

Furthermore, they had the ability to breathe out a cone of shadows that would weaken overall any foes caught in the area. They could do this once a day. 

A distinctive feature of Chaulssinyr ''zekyl'' was a pair of wings on their back that allowed them to fly faster than they could move on land. Normally, only half-dragons of species larger than drow could have wings.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|146-147}}

A ''zekyl'' had a predisposition for the roguish arts, with natural skill in intimidation, as well as an elf's normal keen senses.

==History==
''Zekylyn'' were the half-dragon offspring of [[Clan Jaezred]]'s shadow dragons and the drow of [[Chaulssin]], who were enslaved by the dragons. In [[634 DR]], the dragons were overthrown.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|2-4}}

In [[734 DR]], the now-free citizens of Chaulssin escaped to the [[Plane of Shadow]] to evade the armies of [[Menzoberranzan]], who were bent on killing them for being heretics. On the Plane of Shadow, they were part of the founders of [[Chaul'mur'ssin]]. They learned of a way to divide their dragon and drow lineages, leading to the creation of the race of the [[drow-dragon]]. They returned in a significant number to Toril in [[1136 DR]].

In [[1372]], the majority of the ''zekyl'' lived in Chaulssin{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|1}} and formed the majority of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]]'s membership by a large margin.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}}
