A '''madcap''' was a [[redcap]] that soaked its hat in [[demon]] ichor rather than the customary blood. These [[fey]] exhibited a more extreme version of their more common counterparts' temperament.

==Combat==
Rather than falling unconscious, when a madcap was damaged to the point of no longer being able to fight, it died in a burst of fire that rendered all but its boots and weapon into ash.

==Notable Madcaps==
The [[Knucklebones Gang]], an [[Avernus|Avernian]] gang led by [[Mad Maggie]], counted 30 madcaps among its members.
