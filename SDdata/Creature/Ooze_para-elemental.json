        "mainbody": "'''Ooze para-elementals''', also known as '''mud elementals''', were a variety of [[elemental|para-elemental]] composed of [[ooze]].",
        "Description": "These types of para-elementals had mutable forms that appeared as dark, liquid masses of writhing tendrils. They most often took on a form with a torso, arms, and a head with gaping black indentations where a mouth and eyes would be. And according to some their bodies could be highly [[acid]]ic, rapidly dissolving most organic material and metal.",
        "Personality": "Like all para-elementals they were wary, cautious, and even unfriendly to outsiders in their home plane.",
        "Abilities": "Possessing mutable forms, ooze para-elementals were capable of shifting their way through the smallest and tightest of crevices.''[[Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix III]]'' technically states that, \"fire- and cold-based attacks inflict only half their normal damage,\" but since ooze is the para-element of earth and water this considered to be an error. though some claimed it was an immunity. And some claimed that the spell ''[[transmute mud to rock]]'' could petrify them. When it came to weapons, they generally could only be harmed by those with a ''+1 or greater [[enchantment]]''.",
        "Combat": "Ooze para-elementals typically fought by grappling and constricting opponents with their multitude of tendrils.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Like other para-elementals, those of ooze sustained themselves by converting their elemental opposite, earth, into ooze. However, if they found themselves deprived of this, they would not starve to death.",
            "Homelands": "This variety of para-elemental was native to the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze]], Though they could also be found in the [[elemental planes]] of [[Elemental Plane of Earth|Earth]] and [[Elemental Plane of Water|Water]].\n\nOn the [[Prime Material plane]], they were often encountered in the [[River Ith]].",
            "Languages": "Ooze para-elementals were capable of speaking both [[Aquan]] and [[Terran]], but it always came out in a burbling tone.",
            "Relationships": "They held an enmity towards both [[ooze mephit]]s and [[ooze sprite]]s, with the former often being known to claim dominion over ooze para-elementals, often killing them on sight."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that ooze elementals found themselves to be revolting."
