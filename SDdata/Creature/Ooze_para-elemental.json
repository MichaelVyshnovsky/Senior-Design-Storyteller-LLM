        "mainbody": "Ooze para-elementals, also known as mud elementals, were a variety of para-elemental composed of ooze.\nThese types of para-elementals had mutable forms that appeared as dark, liquid masses of writhing tendrils. They most often took on a form with a torso, arms, and a head with gaping black indentations where a mouth and eyes would be. And according to some their bodies could be highly acidic, rapidly dissolving most organic material and metal.\nLike all para-elementals they were wary, cautious, and even unfriendly to outsiders in their home plane.\nPossessing mutable forms, ooze para-elementals were capable of shifting their way through the smallest and tightest of crevices.Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix III technically states that, \"fire- and cold-based attacks inflict only half their normal damage,\" but since ooze is the para-element of earth and water this considered to be an error. though some claimed it was an immunity. And some claimed that the spell transmute mud to rock could petrify them. When it came to weapons, they generally could only be harmed by those with a +1 or greater enchantment.\nOoze para-elementals typically fought by grappling and constricting opponents with their multitude of tendrils.\nLike other para-elementals, those of ooze sustained themselves by converting their elemental opposite, earth, into ooze. However, if they found themselves deprived of this, they would not starve to death.\nThis variety of para-elemental was native to the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze, Though they could also be found in the elemental planes of Earth and Water.\nOn the Prime Material plane, they were often encountered in the River Ith.\nOoze para-elementals were capable of speaking both Aquan and Terran, but it always came out in a burbling tone.\nThey held an enmity towards both ooze mephits and ooze sprites, with the former often being known to claim dominion over ooze para-elementals, often killing them on sight.\nSome claimed that ooze elementals found themselves to be revolting."
