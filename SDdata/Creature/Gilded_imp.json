        "mainbody": "ilded imps were a variety of imps from the Nine Hells specially blessed by the archdevil Mammon.\nGilded imps resembled the regular variety, but had a second skin of gold.\nMammons golden blessing enhanced the charisma of gilded imps.\nThe golden plating of gilded imps made them much tougher and difficult to hurt than normal imps. Their stingers could also inflict a condition known as \"Mammons Hold,\" which temporarily turned their victims into golden statues."
