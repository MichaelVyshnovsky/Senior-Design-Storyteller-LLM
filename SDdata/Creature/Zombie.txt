A zombie was an undead creature usually created by the re-animation of a corpse. Unlike animated skeletons, zombies still retained some flesh on their bodies and gave off a horrid, rank smell. They were almost mindless, but could be given simple commands, such as "kill anyone who opens the treasure chest." Virtually any solid creature could be turned into a zombie in addition to humanoids, troglodytes, minotaurs, ogres, and even beholders, among others, could be turned into zombies.
Basically, a zombie was the corpse of a creature that had been animated by someone who could manipulate negative energy, such as a cleric. For example, a cleric would be able to use negative energy on a corpse and make it move its body, arms, legs, etc. On rare occasions, ordinary zombies retained some of their basic cognitive functions, able to speak simple words and phrases and some were capable of wielding weapons.
Zombies dragged their feet and so did not leave clear prints.
They were manifestations of the lowest tiers of necromantic magic and were naught but soulless shambling shells. When a zombie was raised, its soul was already long gone to the afterlife and was not forced into the decaying corpse.
Necromancers used demons blood as a powerful magical adhesive liberally applied to zombies joints to stave the rotting and disintegration of tissues.
The monstrous hamlet of Wormbarrow was located deep within Undermountain, inhabited by Ghaunadaur-worshiping avolakias and numerous undead, including zombies.
In the 15 century DR, the Jungles of Chult became home to hordes of zombies created by Ras Nsi in an attempt to conquer the city of Mezro. With the city departing the Prime Material plane, Nsis zombies remained a plague.
10,000 zombies inhabited the so-called City of Zombies in the 333 layer of the Abyss, ruled by the Zombie King. These rotting wrecks were victims of Orcus and sought to achieve true death that would end their torturous existence.
Zombies were common shock troops used by the drow of Menzoberranzan, including House DoUrden that used fellow drow as their undead servants.
