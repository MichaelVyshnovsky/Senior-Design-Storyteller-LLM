A '''zombie''' was an [[undead]] creature usually created by the re-animation of a corpse. Unlike animated [[skeletons]], zombies still retained some flesh on their bodies and gave off a horrid, rank smell. They were almost mindless, but could be given simple commands, such as "kill anyone who opens the treasure chest." Virtually any solid creature could be turned into a zombie; in addition to [[humanoid]]s, [[troglodyte]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[ogre]]s, and even [[beholder]]s, among others, could be turned into zombies.

{{Quote|The Realms would be far friendlier to the undead if we learned to exercise greater control over our culinary habits. I fear most of us are beyond reasoning though. If you can get three moans from a zombie, you can consider it a good conversation.|[[Lyressa]]}}

==Description==
Basically, a zombie was the corpse of a creature that had been animated by someone who could manipulate [[negative energy]], such as a [[cleric]]. For example, a cleric would be able to use negative energy on a corpse and make it move its body, arms, legs, etc. On rare occasions, ordinary zombies retained some of their basic cognitive functions, able to speak simple words and phrases and some were capable of wielding weapons.

Zombies dragged their feet and so did not leave clear prints.<ref>

They were manifestations of the lowest tiers of necromantic magic and were naught but soulless shambling shells. When a zombie was raised, its soul was already long gone to the [[afterlife]] and was not forced into the decaying corpse.{{Cite dragon/180/The Voyage of the Princess Ark|48}}

==Ecology==
Necromancers used [[demon]]s' blood as a powerful magical adhesive liberally applied to zombies' joints to stave the rotting and disintegration of tissues.

===Habitats===
The monstrous hamlet of [[Wormbarrow]] was located deep within [[Undermountain]], inhabited by [[Ghaunadaur]]-worshiping [[avolakias]] and numerous undead, including zombies.

In the 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Jungles of Chult]] became home to hordes of zombies created by [[Ras Nsi]] in an attempt to conquer the city of [[Mezro]]. With the city departing the [[Prime Material plane]], Nsi's zombies remained a plague.

10,000 zombies inhabited the so-called City of Zombies in the 333{{rd}} layer of the [[Abyss]], ruled by the [[Zombie King]]. These rotting wrecks were victims of [[Orcus]] and sought to achieve true death that would end their torturous existence.

===Relationships===
Zombies were common shock troops used by the [[drow]] of [[Menzoberranzan]], including [[House Do'Urden]] that used fellow drow as their undead servants.

They were also a profitable business. [[Shradin's Excellent Zombies]] shop in [[Skullport]] offered zombies controllable via a dead hand scepter for purchase.{{Cite dragon/172/Seeing the Sights in Skullport|12}}
