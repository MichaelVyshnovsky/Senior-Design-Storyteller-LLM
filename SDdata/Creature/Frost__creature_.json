        "mainbody": "'''Frosts''', also known as '''snow fairies''' and '''winter folk''', were distant cousins of [[pixie]]s and [[sprite]]s.",
        "Description": "Frosts were small, [[fey]]-like creatures with wings that looked an insects. Most had pale blue skin, although frosts who lived in subarctic climates had dark blue skin.",
        "Personality": "Frosts delighted in pulling pranks on others. Common pranks include creating slippery patches on ice in the path of larger creatures or shaking snow covered tree branches as someone walks under them.",
        "Abilities": "Frosts had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[cone of cold]]'' three times per day, ''[[frost fingers]]'' twice per day, ''[[ice hands]]'' and ''[[control temperature, 10' radius]]'' at will. Some frosts had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[cold ray]]'' spell. Frosts were immune to the cold and any cold-based effects and spells.",
        "Combat": "Frosts hunted small animals by using [[bow]]s and special daggers of sharp icicles. Frosts never engaged in melee combat with creatures larger than they were. If forced into combat with a larger creature, frosts kept their distance and used their innate magic abilities as weapons. Frosts avoided fire as it could instantly melt their wings, which did not grow back.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Frosts maintained peaceful relations with [[dryad]]s, [[elves]], [[halfling]]s and woodland fairies. They often allied with them to defend a forest from those who wished it harm. Frosts harassed [[human]]s who exploited a forests, such as loggers and hunters. Frosts were hostile towards small evil creatures such as [[quickling]]s.\n\nFrosts sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of [[Aerdrie Faenya]] and [[Ulutiu]].<ref>",
            "Usages": "Some evil [[sorcerer]]s have experimented on frosts to determine if any part of their bodies could be used as [[material component]]s for potions or spells."
