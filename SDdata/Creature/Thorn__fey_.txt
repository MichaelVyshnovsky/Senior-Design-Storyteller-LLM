'''Thorns''' were small [[fey]] warriors who acted as guardians of other fey creatures. They took their name from the longswords they carried, which were constructed from thorny plants. Most thorns in [[Faer√ªn]] lived in the [[Dalelands]] or [[Cormanthor]].
	
==Combat==
Thorns would attack anything that threatened other fey. They preferred to sneak up on opponents and carried [[sleep]] arrows, which caused adversaries to fall into a slumber. They also had the ability to launch a sneak attack.

==Notable Thorns==
* [[Briarsting]], the guardian of a dead [[druid]] in the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Campfire stories were told about both thorns and [[petal]]s to children in the Dalelands to keep them from journeying too far into the forests there.
