        "mainbody": "Dragonspawn, also known as the spawn of Tiamat,\nKobolds and urds were sometimes considered to be members of the dragonspawn group. \nWhile the mutant variants of dragonspawn were based on the five common chromatic dragons, there were a few species bred from other kinds of chromatics. Among those devoted to Tiamat, the birth of a spawn of Tiamat was considered a sign of their goddesss favor.\nSpawn of Tiamat were deeply loyal to their goddess, as they were created with a predisposition to serve the Dark Lady. They also shared her undying hatred of good dragonkind, and they disdained non-dragons of all sorts.\nThey usually worked alongside of other creatures, whether in packs of their kind or with like-minded individuals of other races, particularly evil dragons.\nthumb|250px|right|A deadly redspawn berserker.\nThe first breeds of dragonspawn were kobolds and urds, appearing around . created by Tiamat to serve as her soldiers in that conflict. They were opposed by the dragonborn created by the god Bahamut.\nThe mutant variants reappeared on Toril in 1359 DR, after Bahamut regained his deific status and the Dragon Queen sought to destroy the bastions of her old rival. She sent an avatar to Castle Perilous, and with the help of her Vaasan cultists, began to create the spawn again. \nShe also sent a few full-formed spawns as gifts to her Untheric followers. Her temples began to secretly breed more spawn and smuggled them out of the country to prevent discovery by the Mulhorandi occupation force, thus spreading the spawn across the lands of the Old Empires and beyond. A few spawn joined the Cult of the Dragon, although they only worked with them to further the Dragon Queens agenda.\nRumors of hobgoblin warbands and spawn massing around the Rathgaunt Hills in the southern Shaar became common over time, and many believed the reappearance of the spawn was an indication that a new battle of the Dragonfall War was about to start.\nIn 1479 DR, taaldarax of Brimstones xorvintaal used dragonspawn as their minions in the game. Alasklerbanbastos also sent some spawn to bolster the threskelan army, while other taaldarax gave the ash giants special magic orbs that enabled them to control dragonspawn so the giants could invade Tymanther.\nDragonspawn were also common in the world of Abeir, and most were employed as servants by dragons. In Laerakond, they were numerous in the nation of Melabrauth.\nMost spawn were born from normal dragons eggs, whether by the will of Tiamat or by an accident of chance, although members of the Church of Tiamat knew how to artificially breed their own kinds of spawns and were able to create them at a more dependable frequency. Some spawn of Tiamat were also capable of breeding true. \nSpawn rarely remained with their parents for long. They matured at a quicker rate than true dragons, reaching adulthood in only a few years.\nThere were many species of spawn of Tiamat. \n Redspawn  Several highly destructive dragonspawn descended from red dragons, including\nthumb|200px|right|A redspawn arcaniss calls upon its fiery magic.\n*Redspawn arcaniss - A humanoid spawn born from red dragons that wielded powerful fire magic.\n*Redspawn berserker - A muscular, humanoid dragonspawn that existed purely to destroy.\n*Redspawn birther - Animalistic redspawn that devoured anything they could fit in their jaws.\n*Redspawn devastator - A dragon-like spawn born from red dragons, considered the most powerful of all the spawn species.\n*Redspawn firebelcher - A dragon-like spawn born from red dragons.\n Blackspawn  Sly dragonspawn descended from black dragons, they preferred swampy habitats.\nthumb|200px|right|Blackspawn raiders preferred ambushes in the swamps.\n*Blackspawn stalker - A spider-like ambush predator, also known as the Blackspawn Gloomweb.\n*Blackspawn raider - A humanoid spawn.\n*Blackspawn corruptor - A humanoid spawn that almost always acted alone.\n Bluespawn  Desert-dwelling dragonspawn with an affinity for electricity.
