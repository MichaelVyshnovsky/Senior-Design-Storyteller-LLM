        "mainbody": "'''Dragonspawn''', also known as the '''spawn of Tiamat''',",
        "Description": "[[Kobold]]s and [[urd]]s were sometimes considered to be members of the dragonspawn group. \n\nWhile the mutant variants of dragonspawn were based on the five common chromatic dragons, there were a few species bred from other kinds of chromatics. Among those devoted to Tiamat, the birth of a spawn of Tiamat was considered a sign of their goddess's favor.",
        "Psychology": "Spawn of Tiamat were deeply loyal to their goddess, as they were created with a predisposition to serve the Dark Lady. They also shared her undying hatred of good dragonkind, and they disdained non-dragons of all sorts.\n\nThey usually worked alongside of other creatures, whether in packs of their kind or with like-minded individuals of other races, particularly evil dragons.",
        "History": "[[File:Redspawn berserker 3E.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A deadly redspawn berserker.'']]\nThe first breeds of dragonspawn were kobolds and urds, appearing around {{Yearlink|-24500}}. created by Tiamat to serve as her soldiers in that conflict. They were opposed by the dragonborn created by the god [[Bahamut]].\n\nThe mutant variants reappeared on Toril in [[1359 DR]], after Bahamut regained his deific status and the Dragon Queen sought to destroy the bastions of her old rival. She sent an avatar to [[Castle Perilous]], and with the help of her [[Vaasan]] cultists, began to create the spawn again. \n\nShe also sent a few full-formed spawns as gifts to her [[Unther]]ic followers. Her temples began to secretly breed more spawn and smuggled them out of the country to prevent discovery by the [[Mulhorand]]i occupation force, thus spreading the spawn across the lands of the [[Old Empires]] and beyond. A few spawn joined the [[Cult of the Dragon]], although they only worked with them to further the Dragon Queen's agenda.\n\nRumors of [[hobgoblin]] warbands and spawn massing around the [[Rathgaunt Hills]] in the southern [[Shaar]] became common over time, and many believed the reappearance of the spawn was an indication that a new battle of the Dragonfall War was about to start.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], ''taaldarax'' of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]'' used dragonspawn as their minions in the game. [[Alasklerbanbastos]] also sent some spawn to bolster the [[threskel]]an army, while other ''taaldarax'' gave the [[Stone giant|ash giants]] special magic orbs that enabled them to control dragonspawn so the giants could invade [[Tymanther]].\n\nDragonspawn were also common in the world of [[Abeir]], and most were employed as servants by dragons. In [[Laerakond]], they were numerous in the nation of [[Melabrauth]].",
        "Ecology": "Most spawn were born from normal dragons eggs, whether by the will of Tiamat or by an accident of chance, although members of the [[Church of Tiamat]] knew how to artificially breed their own kinds of spawns and were able to create them at a more dependable frequency. Some spawn of Tiamat were also capable of breeding true. \n\nSpawn rarely remained with their parents for long. They matured at a quicker rate than true dragons, reaching adulthood in only a few years.",
