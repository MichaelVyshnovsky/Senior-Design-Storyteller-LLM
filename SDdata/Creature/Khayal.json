        "Description": "Khayal were largely humanoid in form, often said to look like tall, wiry muscled humans with dark grey skin, black hair, and black eyes.",
        "Personality": "Like all genies, khayal were arrogant and confident; however, khayal were also very deceptive to the point of making an art of it. They were easily offended.",
        "Abilities": "Khayal were natural users of shadow magic, being capable of using the ''[[black candle]]'' fundamental and ''[[pass into shadow]]'' mystery at will, as well as the ''[[dusk and dawn]]'' and ''[[sight eclipsed]]'' mysteries thrice each day, the ''[[bolster]]'' mystery twice each day, and the ''[[umbral body]]'' mystery once each day.\n\nThe greatest weakness of the khayal was that they could not survive long away from the Plane of Shadow; after a maximum of 24 hours away from that plane, they began to sicken until they returned.",
        "Combat": "Khayal were confident to the point of arrogence and courageous in combat, but they considered the concept of a fair fight to be ludicrous and made ample use of ambush tactics, sneak attacks, and their own magic. They would retreat from a losing struggle, but found such actions humiliating and would hold a grudge against those who drove them to it.",
        "Society": {
            "Homeland": "Most khayal lived in the [[City of Onyx]], a place of twisted spires and minarets reaching in all directions, ignoring any laws of architecture or physics. The marketplaces bustled with all manner of people come to trade or travel, but the center was off-limits to all non-khayal. The ruler of the khayal was called the Malik al-Khayal, the King of Shadows, who dwelled in the [[Grand Palace of Endings]]. The leaders of other, lesser communities of khayal in the Plane of Shadow claimed the title of emir."
        },
        "History": "Some sages theorized that the first khayal were formed of an absence of the elements, and that they drifted through the planes until their absence bonded with shadow magic, thus explaining why the khayal held themselves apart from the rest of geniekind."
