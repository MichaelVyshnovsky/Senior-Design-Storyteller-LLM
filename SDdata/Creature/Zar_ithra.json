        "Abilities": "A ''zar'ithra'' exhibited some draconic characteristics and possessed stronger ties to the [[Plane of Shadow]] than their ''[[zekyl]]'' compatriots. These stronger ties manifested in them being able to derive additional abilities from the Plane of Shadow and unlike a ''zekyl'',\n\nCollectively, they had a predisposition towards sorcerous magic.\n\nA genetic quirk of theirs was that any offspring between them and a drow-dragon was almost always a male ''zekyl''.",
        "History": "As mentioned above, ''zar'ithra'' was the name of the non-first-generation offspring of Clan Jaezred's shadow dragons and the drow of Chaulssin, who were enslaved by the dragons. In [[634 DR]], the dragons were overthrown and, in [[734 DR]], the now-free citizens of Chaulssin escaped to the [[Plane of Shadow]] to evade the armies of [[Menzoberranzan]] bent on killing them for being heretics. On the Plane of Shadow, they were part of the founders of [[Chaul'mur'ssin]]. After their ''zekyl'' compatriots learned of a way to divide their dragon and drow lineages, leading to the creation of the race of drow-dragons, they returned in meaningful number to [[Toril]] in [[1136 DR]].\n\nIn [[1372]], the majority of the ''zar'ithra'' lived in Chaulssin and' while they outnumbered the ''zekyl'' population in Chaulssin, they formed only a small minority in the Jaezred Chaulssin's membership.",
        "Activities": "The ones in Chaulssin had the duty to defend the city from both intraplanar as well as extraplanar foes from the Plane of Shadow.\n\nAbout 80% of the harems of the Jaezred Chaulssin's leaders consisted of ''zar'ithra''."
