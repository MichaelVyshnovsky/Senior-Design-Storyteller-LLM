        "Description": "They were distinctive in that each type of Aeorian creature had vibrantly colored flesh.",
        "Abilities": "Aeorian monstrosities did not age and were functionally immortal so long as they were not slain. While they had limited intelligence, they also remembered each moment of their existence.\n\nThey were highly resistant to both [[radiant energy|radiant]] and [[necrotic energy]] as well as all forms of magical attacks.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were ravenous killers and would immediately attack on sight any creature they encountered. They would however never attack one of their own.",
        "Ecology": "Aeorian hunters could also be found on the planet of [[w:c:Criticalrole:Exandria|Exandria]], being named after the floating city of Aeor, where they were firstly created.",
        "History": "The Red Wizards employed Aeorian hunters during their brief takeover of [[Xorvintroth]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Varieties": "* '''Aeorian Absorber''': Large cat-like hunters that could suck in magical energy into their bodies. Absorbers then released that energy in devastating rays emanating from the large eye at the end of their tail, similar to a [[beholder]]'s eyestalk.\n* '''Aeorian Nullifier''': Horrifying monstrosities with bodies that housed far too many mouths. Their mouths made terrifying gnashing noises that could stun or even confuse their foes. Their existence disrupted access to [[the Weave]] around them, negating all spells of certain power within {{SI|60|ft}} of their forms.\n* '''Aeorian Reverser''': These massive beasts ripped into foes with its massive claws and delivered devastating bites with its jaws. Their mere presence negated any form of magical healing within a {{SI|30|ft}} radius extending out from them."
