        "mainbody": "Aeorian hunters were monstrous entities created by the Red Wizards of Thay, by means of magical experiments involving humanoid races and monsters.\nThey were distinctive in that each type of Aeorian creature had vibrantly colored flesh.\nAeorian monstrosities did not age and were functionally immortal so long as they were not slain. While they had limited intelligence, they also remembered each moment of their existence.\nThey were highly resistant to both radiant and necrotic energy as well as all forms of magical attacks.\nThese creatures were ravenous killers and would immediately attack on sight any creature they encountered. They would however never attack one of their own.\nAeorian hunters could also be found on the planet of Exandria, being named after the floating city of Aeor, where they were firstly created.\nThe Red Wizards employed Aeorian hunters during their brief takeover of Xorvintroth in the late 15 century DR.\n* Aeorian Absorber Large cat-like hunters that could suck in magical energy into their bodies. Absorbers then released that energy in devastating rays emanating from the large eye at the end of their tail, similar to a beholders eyestalk.\n* Aeorian Nullifier Horrifying monstrosities with bodies that housed far too many mouths. Their mouths made terrifying gnashing noises that could stun or even confuse their foes. Their existence disrupted access to the Weave around them, negating all spells of certain power within  of their forms.\n* Aeorian Reverser These massive beasts ripped into foes with its massive claws and delivered devastating bites with its jaws. Their mere presence negated any form of magical healing within a  radius extending out from them."
