'''Sprites''' were a grouping of [[fey]] that lived in forests and enjoyed making mischief.

The gods [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Mielikki]], [[Sheela Peryroyl]], and [[Silvanus]] all had sprites among their servants.<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==Description==
All sprites were small creatures with [[elf|elven]] features, ranging from the {{SIAdj|1|ft|adj=tall}} atomie to the {{SIAdj|4|ft|adj=tall}} nixie. Except for the nixie, sprites had insect-like wings and could fly.

==Personality==
As a group, sprites were shy, mischievous fey who hated ugliness and evil. They would fight to protect their homes if necessary, whether through combat or trickery.

==Ecology==
Most sprites were hunter-gatherers who lived in small groups, either as nomads like the grigs or in tiny villages. Sprites typically preferred to live in temperate forest regions.

==Types of sprites==
There were several different types of sprites, including:

*[[Sprite (creature)|Sprite]]
*[[Pixie]]
*[[Nixie]]
*[[Atomie]]
*[[Grig]]

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], a clan of sprites dwelt in the [[Misty Vale]] in [[Brynwood]] in [[the Vast]], where they served [[the Green Lady]], a [[druid]] of [[Eldath]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}
