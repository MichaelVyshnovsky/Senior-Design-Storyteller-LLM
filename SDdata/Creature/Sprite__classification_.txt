Sprites were a grouping of fey that lived in forests and enjoyed making mischief.
The gods Chauntea, Eldath, Erevan Ilesere, Mielikki, Sheela Peryroyl, and Silvanus all had sprites among their servants.
All sprites were small creatures with elven features, ranging from the  atomie to the  nixie. Except for the nixie, sprites had insect-like wings and could fly.
As a group, sprites were shy, mischievous fey who hated ugliness and evil. They would fight to protect their homes if necessary, whether through combat or trickery.
Most sprites were hunter-gatherers who lived in small groups, either as nomads like the grigs or in tiny villages. Sprites typically preferred to live in temperate forest regions.
There were several different types of sprites, including
*Sprite
*Pixie
*Nixie
*Atomie
*Grig
In 1369 DR, a clan of sprites dwelt in the Misty Vale in Brynwood in the Vast, where they served the Green Lady, a druid of Eldath.
