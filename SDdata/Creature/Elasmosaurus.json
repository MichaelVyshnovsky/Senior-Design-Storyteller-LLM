        "mainbody": "Elasmosaurs  () were a type of aquatic dinosaur.\nThey possessed long snake-like necks and tails and muscular ovoid bodies with fins in place of legs. Elasmosaurs measured  long, with the tail comprising fully half the length, and couldweigh up to . Those who sighted only the head or tail from the surface might mistake it for an enormous serpent.\nThey were powerful, quick, and had great maneuverability, being able to make sharp turns. Despite their size, they were surprising good at hiding, at least underwater.\nAlthough largely water-dwelling, elasmosaurs were not amphibious and must return to the surface to breathe.\nThey saw with low-light vision and had a good sense of scent.\nFintails could be found alone or in pairs, or in herds of 5 to 8 specimens.\nThey hunted by swimming near the surface with their head above water, then dove swiftly to snatch prey. One would attack any creature it came across, lunging forward with its neck and snapping at its prey.\nIn the Realms, they could particularly be found in the lake of Moonsea."
