Much like any type of sphinx, this creatures had the body of a [[lion]] with great feathery wings, but their head was that of a [[hawk]].

==Personality==
These creatures known to be quite evil and savage, with intellects that were generally far lower than other types of sphinxes.

Much like other sphinxes, a hieracosphinx was known to covet treasure.

==Combat==
Hieracosphinxes attacked creatures clawing at them with their leonine paws and pecking with their hawkish beaks.

==Society==
===Diet===
These creatures generally fed upon warm-blooded creatures, with [[human]]s often being among some of their most favorite meals.
===Habitats===
In the [[Zakhara]] region's [[Crowded Sea]], hierachosphinxes could be found on the island chain of [[Nada al-Hazan]].
===Relationships===
These creatures were often known to serve as [[mount]]s for more powerful and evil-aligned beings. 

They were considered a [[favored monster]] of the [[Orc pantheon|orcish]] god [[Ilneval]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12}}

==History==
Around [[1374 DR]], one could find hieracophinxes stabled by the [[Zhentarim]] as mounts within the [[Temple in the Sky]].<ref>
