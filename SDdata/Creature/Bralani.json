        "mainbody": "'''Bralani''' were the wildest of the [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]], embodying the forces of sand, wind, and snow.\n\nA bralani could be summoned by [[Summon monster VI|powerful summoning spells]] to aid mortals.",
        "Description": "Bralani eladrin looked similar to short, broad-shouldered, stocky but graceful elves with silvery-white hair and eyes that shift through a rainbow of colors depending on the bralani's mood.The height ranges given for bralanis in the ''[[Warriors of Heaven]]'' sourcebook are clearly an error. and weighed roughly {{SI|140|pounds|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "Of the celestial eladrin, bralani were the most emotional and fickle, making them most difficult for others to approach. They exalted in freedom and beauty. They loved to race and dance aimlessly across their wilderness homes, yet if they encountered evil, they were quick to anger and ready to defend good.\n\nBralani were very intelligent. There were exceptions, but no bralani was ever lawful or evil.",
        "Abilities": "Bralani were extremely agile and swift of foot. They were surprisingly strong and dexterous\n\nAll eladrin were immune to electrical and petrifying dangers and resistant against the effects of cold and [[fire]], and bralani shared these qualities. They were resistant to spells\n[[File:Celestial Eladrin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''A [[ghaele]] (left) and a bralani (right).'']]\nBralani had an array of inherent magical powers, among them were the ability to [[blur]] or create [[mirror image]]s of themselves, or [[neutralize poison]]. Every so often, they could muster the power to [[heal]] an ally but not themselves.\n\nIf in the most dire of need, bralani could [[gate]] in other bralani to aid them.\n\nLike all eladrin, bralani could assume an incorporeal form. In their alternate form, they appeared as a whirlwind of dust, snow, or sand, according to their environment. In such a form, they could fly with perfect maneuverability more than double their ground speed, and they could pummel enemies with sand or snow.\n\nBralani eladrin could use their innate magic to [[Tongues|speak in any language]], but their native languages were [[Celestial language|Celestial]] and Eladrin.",
        "Combat": "The favored weapons of the bralani were [[spear]], They were as likely to abandon weapons and attack in their whirlwind forms, however.\n\nSome bralani wore armor or bore shields, but this prevented them from taking their whirlwind forms, so most did not.\n\nWhen battling with allies, they usually took the role of scouts or skirmishers, seeking to flank the enemy and disrupt foes.",
        "Society": "The bralani lived lives similar to those of desert nomands. but they also lived in the [[elven]] realm of [[Arvandor]] and the [[Gates of the Moon]].\n\nOn Mithardir, they traveled in loose bands with no leaders, acting on impulse alone, and traveling as much as hundreds of miles in a single day. Sometimes, they would stop to play pranks on travelers or to combat evil.\n\nSmall groups of one to three bralani sometimes visited other worlds and lived among tribes of noble savages. Like all eladrin, they were sworn not to reveal their true natures when on the [[Prime Material Plane]].",
        "Ecology": "Bralani were not immortal, yet their lifespans were long. A typical bralani could live for about 650 years.",
        "History": "[[File:Gwynharwyf.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Gwynharwyf]], the Whirling Fury.'']]\nA group of powerful bralani, led by a [[ghaele]], had formed an ancient pact with the staff of the school at the [[Windsong Tower]] in [[Myth Drannor]] to guard one of its treasure vaults. The eladrin were still present until the year [[1376 DR]].",
        "Notable Bralani": "* [[Gwynharwyf]], one of the consorts of Queen [[Morwel]]"
