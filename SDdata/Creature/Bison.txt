'''Bison''' were large herd animals.
==Description==
Bison were large, strong animals. They had a distinctive broad head that connected to large, humped shoulders with a thick neck. Bison had short curved horns that grew from the sides of their head. The horns were hollow. Their large body was covered in fur and their head was covered in a mantle of thick fur, and males had a black beard-like growth. They had short but powerful legs. Bison had a small tail that ended in a tassel of fur. 
==Behavior==
Bison were normally docile and peaceful creatures, avoiding conflict with a predator if possible. However, they were extremely protective of their offspring and fiercely defended them. They also became aggressive during mating season.
==Combat==
Bison herds, when frightened, stampeded. Due to their sheer size and numbers, a stampeding bison herd crushed almost any creature in their path.
==Reputation==
Bison were a favored animal of the [[Mulhorandi]] goddess [[Hathor]]. Bison were considered a sacred animal to [[wemic]]s.

==Ecology==
Bison were capable of running very fast over short distances and had incredible endurance. Bison were fast enough to outrun a [[horse]]. Bison had a very sensitive sense of smell and could hear a predator creeping up on them with great accuracy. 
==Habitat==
Bison lived in temperate plains. They could be found in [[Halruaa]], the [[Great Rift]], the [[Pasocada Basin]], [[Pelleor's Prairie]], the [[Outlands]], the [[Shaar]], and the [[Shining Plains]].<ref>

Intelligent [[Celestial creature|celestial]] bison lived in the [[Upper Planes]] and could be [[Summon monster III|summoned]] by spellcasters of moderate power for aid.

==Uses==
Some [[shaman]]s used the skulls of bison to make [[totem]]s. Bison heads could be stuffed and mounted as a decorative wall feature. Bison were hunted as they provided food, their bones could be used to make tools and their pelt used in building simple shelters. In [[Maztica]], the [[Azuposi]] and [[Poscadar elves]] both hunted bison. Despite being considered a sacred animal, wemics still hunted bison for food.
