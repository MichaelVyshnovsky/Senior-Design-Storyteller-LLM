'''Giant lobsters''' were a monstrous variety of the crustaceans of the [[lobster|same name]].These core sources &mdash; ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' on page 50, ''[[Monstrous Compendium Volume Two]]'' on page 29, and the 1{{st}} edition [[Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition|''Dungeon Masters Guide'']] on pages 180 & 224 &mdash; all state that [[crayfish]] and [[lobster]]s are the same thing. While crayfish are similar to lobsters and are even colloquially known as "freshwater lobsters," they are distinct creatures.

==History==
Around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a juvenile [[storm giant]] named [[Alexandra]] went into the [[Dragon Reach]] with an ''[[apparatus of Kwalish]]'' that had been gifted to her by her father and playfully interacted with some of the local giant lobsters.

Around that time, one could purchase a whole giant lobster to dine upon at [[Sharkey's Bar & Grill]].<ref>

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
These creatures were known to inhabit the Dragon Reach.
===Relationships===
[[Giant nautilus]]es were known to prey upon these creatures.

==Trivia==
A giant lobster could be summoned with the [[spell]] ''[[Monster Summoning IV]]''.
