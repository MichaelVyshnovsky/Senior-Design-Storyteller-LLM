        "Description": "On average a scum creeper grew to be {{SI|0.5|ft|long=yes}} in diameter and {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length. They had fat, slimy bodies similar to slugs that were largely grey in color, with sickly white underbellies and pale yellow heads. However, they had a myriad of tiny hooked legs and suctioning segments on their underbelly that allowed them to freely crawl along walls and ceilings. Much like a [[leech]], on the lower portion of their head was a small sucker-like mouth full of sharp, shearing plates of hornlike substance.",
        "Combat": "Much like leeches, these creatures used their mouths to fasten themselves to their prey and eat away at them until either they or their prey was dead.",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], scum creepers could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Scum creepers were an omnivorous species, willing to eat just about anything. They were primarily known to feed upon plant growth, but would also eat rotting cloth, wood, and flesh.",
            "Habitats": "Scum creepers were typically found underground and in dismal swamps where [[the sun]]'s rays barely broke through.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], these creatures were commonly found on [[Illithid]] homeworlds.{{Cite dragon/150/The Dragon's Bestiary: All life crawls where mind flayers rule|16}}"
