The act would open a gateway allowing the wendigo to come from the Abyss. Those that were turned into wendigos through willing cannibalism sometimes enjoyed their newfound form and power, while those who committed the offense out of starvation would suffer as a result.",

        "Combat": "Wendigos fought with their bites and claws, relying on stealth as they hunted their prey."
