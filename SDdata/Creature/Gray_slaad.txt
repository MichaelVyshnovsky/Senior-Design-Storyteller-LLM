'''Gray slaadi''', sometimes spelled '''grey slaadi''' but also referred to as '''rift slaads''' or '''executioners''', were [[green slaad]]s that had undergone a magical metamorphosis. They were known as the executioners for their service to the malevolent [[death slaad]]s, carrying out their demands on missions of doom.

==Description==
Compared to the common slaadi, gray slaads were relatively small and lean, appearing as frog-like [[humanoid]]s that stood {{SI|6|ft}} tall. They seemed swifter as well as skinnier and had long, clawed fingers. Some said their gray complexion was spotted while earlier it was claimed to be even and light.

==Personality==
Gray slaads shared the same power-hungry obsession with magic that their former selves did, but to an even greater degree. They were so fascinated by magic that they no longer cared about the activities of the lesser [[red slaad|red]], [[blue slaad|blue]] and green [[slaad]]s, devoting all their attention to their studies. Some trained as [[sorcerer]]s to bring out their inherent magical ability while others enjoyed augmenting their power by crafting magical items, but most sought the virtually immortal might of the death slaads.

==Abilities==
Gray slaadi were no less physically dangerous for their increased magical power, possessing most of the abilities of their prior forms as well as additional powers. They could skillfully [[major image|craft illusions]], imbue items with magic, perform [[flame strike]]s, [[walk on air|walk on wind]], magically [[fly]], speak and create various power words and symbols and [[plane shift]] on top of their green slaadi abilities, although like the green slaads, no individual possessed all of such powers. They could [[polymorph]] into humanoid forms, often those of their original hosts, and could summon other gray slaads, as well as the common types. Other rumored abilities included immunities to the [[cold]], disintegration and non-enchanted weapons, along with the more esoteric powers to teleport and disrupt planar stability.

==Combat==
Despite preferring ranged combat using their magical abilities, gray slaadi weren't adverse to entering melee, fighting with tooth and claw in their slaad forms and training to wield [[greatsword]]s, often magical blades, when in their humanoid forms. They were intelligent enough to flank and use their abilities based on current circumstances, although their ability to teleport sometimes manifested when they were seriously injured, resulting in them losing their grasp on physical reality and temporarily becoming insubstantial.

==Society==
Aside from the death slaadi, gray slaads were the most dreaded of the slaads, sent to the [[Prime Material Plane]] to act on their behalf. They disguised themselves as somewhat charismatic humanoids, typically wearing light clothing and in possession of one or two powerful magical items, as well as a pouch of [[gold]] or [[platinum]]. They were known to operate in pairs and in groups of three or four

Although slaadi typically had little actual influence in the [[Blood War]], gray slaadi, in their lust for new magical items, were known to trade information to both sides.

==Ecology==
After returning from over a year of isolation, green slaadi were instantly turned into gray slaads via a mysterious magical process. By taking part in an enigmatic ritual that suffused them with [[negative energy]], gray slaads could gain even more power at the cost of corrupting their [[chaos|chaotic]] ways with the murderous sadism of true [[evil]]. It was said that, if they consumed an entire, deceased death slaad, the gray slaad that did so would instantly transform into a death slaad themselves. Regardless of the process used, gray slaadi kept their memories after the transformation, albeit tainted by their new perspectives.

===Subraces===
The variant gray slaads referred to as havocs gleefully took part in furthering the confusion of combat, using their control over space to redirect enemy attacks and shifting the positions of enemies and allies to their whims. They blasted enemies from afar to goad them into shooting them only to send the attack hurtling back, although since this typically only worked once they spent the remainder of the time reshaping the battlefield to their advantage. If havocs released too much chaotic energy at once they could potentially cause planar instability, with some stories saying that enough of them could open gates to other [[plane]]s.

There were also special havocs with even more dangerous abilities known as acolytes of entropy, fanatical worshipers of [[Ygorl]] that lived to spread physical destruction and mental disorder. Brought together by the [[black slaad|void slaad]] [[Skirnex]], they charged recklessly into battle with intent to destroy as much as possible, fully intending to be hurt as even their wounds caused entropic energy to spread around them.

==Notable Gray Slaadi==
* [[Dregadzel]], a gray slaad servant of the [[slaad lord]] [[Bazim-Gorag]], who acted as a secretary for his [[Flame Lord]] acolyte [[Moskogg]], a [[half-fiend]] [[minotaur]]. She made sure his fiery fury was channeled into efficient plans in the form of a scholarly, [[human]] woman.

* The [[Sorrowful Executioner]], a gray slaad that mastered a rampaging red slaad horde known as The Lone Claw, one of the greatest slaad packs in [[Limbo]]. They specialized in unexpected shock strikes and skilled diversions, although their goals were utterly unknown and they left as quickly as they arrived.
