The Krestung was a breed of monstrous flying creature that lurked in the depths of the Vorkani Mountains in Koryo in Kara-Tur.
It resembled a great vulture with a long neck like a snake and the head of a wolf of hideous and evil aspect. Packs of these creatures raided even the best-guarded caravans, snatching away horses and humans alike. Folk of Koryo knew them from pictures.
