        "Description": "As their name suggested, these snakes were covered in white fur. Their hairs were barbed so as to gain better traction on snow and ice. They grew to be up to {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} long, and were warm-blooded.",
        "Behavior": "White-furred snakes would lie in wait for prey along snowy mountain paths. They attacked with a powerful bite, but the danger lay in their ability to constrict and crush their prey.",

            "Homelands": "They were endemic to the [[Bloodstone Lands]] of [[Damara]] and [[Vaasa]].\n\nWhite-furred snakes could also be found on the [[planet|world]] of [[Nehwon]],",
