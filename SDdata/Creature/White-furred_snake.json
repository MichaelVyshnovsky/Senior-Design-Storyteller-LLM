        "mainbody": "White-furred snakes, also known as snow serpents, were a species of constrictor snake native to cold regions.\nAs their name suggested, these snakes were covered in white fur. Their hairs were barbed so as to gain better traction on snow and ice. They grew to be up to  long, and were warm-blooded. \nWhite-furred snakes would lie in wait for prey along snowy mountain paths. They attacked with a powerful bite, but the danger lay in their ability to constrict and crush their prey.\nWhite-furred snakes hunted in arctic hills, mountains, and plains, and could also be found in rough terrain and ruins. \nThey were endemic to the Bloodstone Lands of Damara and Vaasa.\nWhite-furred snakes could also be found on the world of Nehwon,\nTheir fur could be used for a wide range of unusual functions."
