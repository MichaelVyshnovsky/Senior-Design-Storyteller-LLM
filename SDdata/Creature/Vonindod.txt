The Vonindod, (meaning "titan of death" in Jotun) was a colossal construct used against dragons during the ancient wars between giants and dragons.

Vonindod fought for most of the Thousand Year War. Though it travelled slowly and was hindered by being earthbound, it proved highly effective in raiding dragons lairs and slew more wyrms than even Hjurnur Wyrmrever. During the latter half of the war it was deployed to the northern cities of Ostoria.
From then on it sustained significant damage during the war, with pieces being lost during battle, becoming increasingly difficult. When the war was finally over what remained on Vonindod was at least partially dismantled and scattered throughout the North, with the pieces shared among the surviving giant cities of Ostoria.
It was not until an ambitious fire giant named Duke Zalto that any attempt was made to re-assemble the pieces of the construct. He sent many of his minions out into the North to seek the remaining pieces of the Vonindod using specially created rods of the Vonindod to act as divining rods. He was able to assemble most of the head, torso, one hand, and a forearm, and the greatsword in his ancestral home of Ironslag, but lacked a fire hot enough to rekindle the forge there to continue the work.
Giant legends claimed that the horns of its helmet were long enough to pierce through a dragons body and that its greatsword was powerful enough to cleave a mountaintop.
