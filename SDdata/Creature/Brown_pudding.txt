A '''brown pudding''' was an uncommon relative of the [[black pudding]] that was tougher and suited to marshy environments.

==Description==
Brown puddings were the most naturally armored of the black pudding's relatives, but their attacks were not as strong.

As per other puddings, they were non-intelligent, and wandered alone. They could grow up to {{SI|8|ft}} in diameter.

==Ecology==
Instead of corroding metals, brown puddings dissolved wood and leather. They consumed items made of such materials in about a minute, even if they were highly enchanted.
===Habitats===
They were known to be found among traps in [[Undermountain]] on [[Toril]], and even in [[the Castle]] in the [[Tears of Sel√ªne]] asteroid cluster. In this instance, the dangerous puddings fed upon [[raven]]s and grass. They hid themselves very well, making them notoriously difficult to eradicate.

In the [[Abyss]], brown puddings could be found in [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, [[Layers of the Abyss#222|222nd layer of the Abyss]].
