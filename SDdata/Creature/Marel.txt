'''Marels''' were a subrace of [[evil]] [[Aquatic elf|aquatic elven]] race that worshiped [[Umberlee]].

==Description==
These pale skin elves had blackish-green hair and green eyes which had an phosphorescent glow. They were otherwise identical to aquatic elves.

== Combat ==
Marels wore armor made of shells. They primarily fought with [[trident]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[net]]s, and often adorned them with the spines of rare and poisonous aquatic plants. Marel spellcasters would often attempt to dispel the magic that allowed surface-dwellers to breathe underwater, delighting in watching them drown.

==History==
Marel were normal aquatic elves until they refused to help the [[human]] city of [[Northkeep]] in [[400 DR]] and were punished by the gods, transforming them into marel.

==Society==

=== Settlement ===
The only marel city was Mareliar. the population was around 2,000 marels, including around 500 children. It was ruled by King [[Uhlmor]] and Queen [[Oaleah]]. The city had two portals, one that led to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] and one that led to Umberlee's realm, which at the time was a layer of the [[Abyss]].

=== Culture ===
Marels were compelled to guard the sunken city of Northkeep, but hated this duty and in particular despised the ever-ringing bells of the high tower as it reminded them of their failure. They tried in vain to silence the bells whenever they could.

Marels enjoyed crawling aboard ships in the dark of night and silently killing the crew,

=== Magic & Religion ===
Following the sinking of Northkeep, the marels turned their worship to [[Umberlee]] instead of Deep Sashelas or the [[Seldarine]]. Eight was a sacred number to them.

Unlike other aquatic elves, marels had the usual ratio of mages for elven races.

=== Relations ===
Marels did not cooperate with other evil aquatic races, preferring to be left alone. They also hated surface elves.

==Notable Marels==
* [[Shelavassa]], a member of the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]]
