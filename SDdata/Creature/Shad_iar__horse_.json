        "Description": "These compact horses were strong, hardy and extremely sure-footed. For generations, they had been trained for battle and were steadfast in combat.\n\nThey fed only on the tall [[grass]]es of their native land but enjoyed [[carrot]]s, [[radish]]es and kohlrabi as treats.",
        "History": "These noble horses were an intrinsic part the Shad'iar culture and were revered by the nomadic people. This relationship between riders and steed was entwined in the tribe's cultural history and lore. The horses were never sold to those outside the tribe but fetched a handsome sum, over 1000 [[gp]], when sold between tribe members."
