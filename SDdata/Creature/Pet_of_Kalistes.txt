A '''pet of Kalistes''' was a very intelligent and exceptionally powerful [[giant spider]] that was created by the [[marilith]], [[Kalistes]].

==Description==
Such [[giant spider]]s could move quickly and had tough natural armor.

==Combat==
These creatures were deadly in combat. Pets of Kalistes attacked with an extraordinary potent [[poison]]; it was so powerful that a single bite would often instantly kill an opponent. As well as being able to see invisible creatures and [[blink]] around, they could cast ''[[death spell]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', ''[[fire touch]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', and ''[[fire shield]]''. They were well armored, very resistant to [[magic]], and were immune to being [[charm]]ed, poisoned, and all sources of [[death magic]].

==Ecology==
Pets of Kalistes were common in [[Kalistes' dimension|their creator's dimension]], and were known to lurk in specific parts of the [[Underdark]].
