Such a mind-warping power drained the victim's personality and self-esteem, although other demons and those with sibriex-grafted flesh were immune. By focusing their efforts, sibriexes could near-instantly warp several creatures nearby, permanently turning those incapable of resisting into the deformed monstrosities known as [[abyssal wretch]]es.

If for whatever reason a being wanted to accept a sibriex's flesh-warping, they could undergo an excruciating, hour-long process that permanently transformed them without turning them into a wretch.

        "Description": "Sibriexes were bloated, {{SI|15|ft}} tall demons that were little more than {{SI|1500|lb|k}}, deformed heads. The reek of rotten vegetation hung off their misshapen bodies and they constantly exuded streams of blood and bile, polluting the ground and causing plants to wither wherever they went. Their faces were the size of wagons, with shriveled arms ending in trembling digits where their ears would be. In place of a neck, the underbelly of a sibriex hosted a writhing mass of stalks, puckers, and feeding tubes. Although they could lazily float through the air, a body harness fitted with [[steel]] [[chain]]s ending in sharpened spikes was tied around their bodies, which tethered them to the ground and could be animated by them in order to \"walk\" along solid surfaces.",

        "Combat": "Most sibriexes, if threatened, would immediately try to melt down their enemies with their acidic bile before ''charming'' foes to their side in order to better their chances. Afterwards, they used ''feeblemind'' to disable enemy spellcasters as appropriate to the situation. They were extremely skilled in the use of their chains as weapons, lashing out at enemies in single, fluid motions by gracefully striking with one chain and anchoring it in order to let the other chains hit. While capable of biting opponents, such a tactic was less effective, although they would still do so to any opponent in reach.\n\nSome sibriexes preferred to use their sheer unworldly presence to terrify enemy ranks while soaring across the battlefield. They would immobilize or otherwise limit their foe's movements before quickly turning them into pools of foul gore using their bile. Others viewed combat as a testing ground for their experiments, restraining foes before warping their flesh and turning them into terrifying monstrosities.",
        "Society": "Sibriexes had no tolerance for equals among their associates and were found either surrounding themselves with lowly thralls or under the orders of a greater power.\n\nAs a rule, sibriexes preferred to avoid politics and tried to keep themselves apart from major conflicts, living in large, isolated fortresses or unclaimed areas of the Abyss. Such lairs were guarded by armies of lesser demons and charmed monsters, allowing a sibriex to focus on strengthening their position.",
        "Ecology": "The origin of sibriexes was largely unknown, but some sages claimed that they had come from an alien universe at the time of the creation of the Abyss. According to the [[World Axis cosmology]], this event coincided with the insertion of the [[shard of evil]] into the [[Elemental Chaos]] by [[Tharizdun]].{{Cite dragon/359/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Apocrypha|44-49}} \n\nThe sibriexes were thought to have originally been spawned from ancient clans of obyriths specializing in flesh crafting, enslavement, and academic pursuits. They were never numerous, even before the fall of the obyriths, and the conditions for their reproduction seemed to have been lost with obyrith dominion. It was estimated that there were only a few hundred sibriexes in existence, usually no more than one per each [[Layers of the Abyss|layer of the Abyss]].",
        "History": "During the war waged by the obyriths against [[law]], the precursor to the [[Blood War]], sibriexes were tasked with breeding and augmenting the obyrith armies with their implants. After generations of experiments, sibriexes played a major role in the creation of the various tanar'ri races that initially fought for their obyrith masters. Their craft could most easily be seen in some of the characteristics of tanar'ri anatomy that looked artificial, such as the half-organic armor plating found underneath the flesh of the [[glabrezu]]s and [[hezrou]]s.\n\nAfter the obyriths' defeat at the hands of the tanar'ri, sibriexes used their cunning to swiftly switch sides and started working for the new demon lords in the same way they served their former masters. Whether or not there was any kind of underlying scheme behind the augmentation of the race that overthrew their former masters was unknown.",
        "Notable Sibriexes": "Five brilliant sibriexes inhabited the [[Scabwash Sentinels]], a laboratory located in the ocean portion of [[Gaping Maw]], the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 88: Gaping Maw|88{{th}} layer]] of the Abyss. The sea around the laboratory was constantly polluted with refuse and crowded by their failed experiments."
