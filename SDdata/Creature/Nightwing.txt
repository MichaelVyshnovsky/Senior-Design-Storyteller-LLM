'''Nightwings''' were a type of [[nightshade]], horrific undead monsters of evil and darkness.

==Description==
Nightwings appeared as nothing more that bat-shaped darkness, but they had a {{SIAdj|40|ft|long=yes}} wingspan and weighed {{SI|4000|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Abilities==
Like other nightshades, nightwings possessed a {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes}} [[desecration|desecrating]] aura but were averse to sunlight.

Nightwings in particular could drain the [[magic]] from items with but a touch, and they had a number of [[spell]]-like abilities as well. They could mimic the spells ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', and ''[[unholy blight]]'' at will; ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[greater dispel magic]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', and ''[[hold monster]]'' thrice per night; and ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', and ''[[planeshift]]'' once each night.

Additionally, one time each night a nightwing could summon a number of undead: either 5–12 [[shadow]]s, 2–4 [[greater shadow]]s, or 1 [[dread wraith]].

==Combat==
Nightwings attacked from the sky, and made liberal use of ''haste'' in combat.

==Ecology==
Nightwings were native to the [[Plane of Shadow]]. They spent most of their time hunting on the wing.

Like other nightshades, they sometimes acted as servants of [[Shar]].<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|14}}
