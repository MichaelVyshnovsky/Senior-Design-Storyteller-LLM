Some loaded them with alchemical concoctions that paralyze creatures or cloud their minds with paranoia."

            "Creation": "Iron cobras could be created from {{SI|100|lb|long=yes}} of iron by a caster of above-average skill who could cast both arcane and divine spells. The creation process also required use of the spells ''[[animate object]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', ''[[geas/quest]]'', and ''[[locate creature]]''."

        "History": "It was said that the first eight iron cobras were created ages ago by a powerful wizard-cleric, and that they were indestructible. Other spellcasters after them tried to copy the design, but with uniformly less powerful results.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that there were only a dozen or so iron cobras in existence."
