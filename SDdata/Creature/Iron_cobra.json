        "mainbody": "Iron cobras were a type of serpentine construct. They were favored by the Scaled Ones for their snakelike form.\nThese constructs were typically made of iron, though some consisted of unknown metals.\nIron cobras were activated and de-activated by their masters through use of command words. When activated an iron cobra obeyed simple commands while de-active, an iron cobra was completely silent. Some described this ability of theirs as them honing in on their targets psychic vibrations and that they could be blocked by spells such as mind blank.\nDespite their size and metal forms, iron cobras were surprisingly stealthy.\nTheir bodies possessed a magic resistance and could see in areas of total darkness out to a range of . They were immune to spells that affected the mind and some were unaffected by the spell web. They could not be harmed by non-magical weapons unless they were made of adamantine.\nIron cobras were venomous, with an internal reservoir that held three doses of poison, though said reservoir could be refilled in but a minute. The exact type of poison varied, although venom from a monstrous spider was a common choice. Some loaded them with alchemical concoctions that paralyze creatures or cloud their minds with paranoia.\nIron cobras combat tactics were simple, but typically effective bite until the enemy died.\nAs constructs, they had little to no effect on their surrounding environment, and could be found in any land ecosystem.\nIron cobras could be created from  of iron by a caster of above-average skill who could cast both arcane and divine spells. The creation process also required use of the spells animate object, freedom of movement, geas/quest, and locate creature.\nIt was said that the first eight iron cobras were created ages ago by a powerful wizard-cleric, and that they were indestructible. Other spellcasters after them tried to copy the design, but with uniformly less powerful results.\nSome claimed that there were only a dozen or so iron cobras in existence."
