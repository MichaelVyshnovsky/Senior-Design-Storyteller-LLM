Flamespikers were a type of elemental composed of the elements air, earth, and fire.
Their humanoid bodies were composed of stone, with a hollow core of roiling flames. Their bodies also contained a very rich kind of clay.
These elementals could launch flaming stone spikes at their enemies and thrust thundering blasts of flame.
In 1479 DR, flamespikers could be found within and around Mount Hotenow. 
Around that time Heartleaf, a dryad living on Mount Hotenow, hired a group of adventurers to slay some flamespikers for their clay so she could use it to help protect and spur the growth of her reforestation efforts in the area surrounding Mount Hotenow.
Also late into the 15 century DR, a group of adventurers on the continent of Laerakond prevented the Cult of Reborn Flame from conducting a ritual to awaken the sleeping Dawn Titan named Achazar that would have sacrificed the residents of the port-city Tarmalune. In the wake of the failed ritual, flamestrikers and other elementals crossed over from the Plane of Fire and sought to destroy the adventurers as they tried to flee to Tarmalune.
Later, during the Elemental Evil crisis, flamespikers were being utilized by members of one of the four elemental cults responsible for the crisis, the Cult of the Eternal Flame.
These elementals often acted as front-line warriors for more powerful creatures that dwelled in the Elemental Chaos.
Beyond the Elemental Chaos, these elementals could sometimes be found on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
