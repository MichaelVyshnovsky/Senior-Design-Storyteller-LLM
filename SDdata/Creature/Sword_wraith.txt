Sword wraiths, also known as swordwraiths, were undead creatures that would arise from the bodies of mercenaries whose lust for war was too great for death to extinguish.
Much like a revenant, sword wraiths looked like decayed and emaciated versions of their once-living selves. Their eyes gave off a faint glow that could only be seen in darkness or dim light. Both their armor and weapons often carried a scent of mold and decay.
Sword wraiths wore the same clothing that they died in, often a breastplate or chainmail.
Sword wraiths generally were known to wield longswords, heavy crossbows, large metal shields, and longbows.
The driving force behind every sword wraith was a desire for combat, wishing to have their unlife ended gloriously on the field of battle. Though difficult, it was possible to calm a sword wraiths bloodlust and negotiate with them if convinced that the speaker was their military equal (or superior).
They were also known to often be easily calmed by means of praise, such as performing a ballad in their honor. Though if a sword wraiths valor was ever questioned they would fly into a fit of rage.
Sword wraiths were generally found prowling around the area in which they were buried or died. Though lone sword wraiths could be found, they more often were seen traveling with other sword wraiths whom in life were part of the same mercenary company or army squadron.
A great many of them haunted the ruins of Anauril, the City of Swords in ancient Anauria.
Besides Toril, sword wraiths were known to occur on the planet Oerth
* The Order of One Thousand Nightmares a knightly order of nearly 200 sword wraiths from the Fields of the Dead, equipped with nightmare steeds, was assembled by priests of Velsharoon.
Towns that were located close to ancient battlefields would often hold an annual festival in remembrance of sword wraiths in order to keep their raging spirits placated.
