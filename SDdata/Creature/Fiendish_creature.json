        "mainbody": "A '''fiendish creature''' was a creature living on one of the [[Lower Planes]] that bore a resemblance to a similar creature on the [[Material Plane]]. Often mistaken for [[half-fiend]]s, these creatures were not nearly so powerful and did not share a bloodline with any of the true [[fiend]]s. \nMany fiendish creatures were to fiends as animals were to [[human]]s of the Material Plane.",
        "Description": "Fiendish creatures looked much like their counterparts on the Prime, except that they often had visible signs of the unholy realms where they dwelt, with a somewhat terrifying appearance.",
        "Abilities": "Outside their fearsome appearances, fiendish creatures were in most ways similar to the prime creatures that they resembled, but there were a few significant differences. All fiendish creatures were sentient with at least minimal intelligence. A fiendish [[snake]] would be more intelligent than any snake native to [[Toril]].\n\nAll fiendish creatures had the ability to [[Darkvision|see in the dark]] and were resistant to harm from [[cold]], [[fire]], [[spell]]s, and often to attacks from mundane weapons.\n\nAn attack from a fiendish creature had the supernatural power to cause more harm to creatures that were good.",
        "Personality": "All fiendish creatures were evil like the planes on which they dwelt.",
        "Ecology": "There were a plethora of creatures living on all of the Lower Planes that were similar to ones from Toril yet had adapted to those evil worlds. For example, fiendish crustaceans inhabited [[Blibdoolpoolp]]'s [[divine realm|realm]] in the [[Fated Depths]]. Fiendish [[dire wolves]] and [[troll]]s hunted the layer of [[Niflheim]] in [[Hades]]. Fiendish [[shark]]s swam the waters of [[Stygia]].",
        "Notable Fiendish Creatures": "Over the centuries, both [[Divine magic|divine]] and [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spellcasters had learned the power to [[Summon monster|summon]] many varieties of fiendish creatures from their home planes for temporary aid. Common among these were fiendish [[ape]]s, [[boar]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[deinonychus]]es, [[dire rat]]s, [[dire weasel]]s, [[elasmosaurus]]es, [[giant praying mantis]]es, [[giant spider]]s, [[giant wasp]]s, [[girallon]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[megaraptor]]s, [[monstrous centipede]]s and [[Monstrous scorpion|scorpions]], [[octopus]]es, [[raven]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, sharks, [[snake]]s, [[squid]], [[tiger]]s, [[tyrannosaurus]]es, [[wolves]], and [[wolverine]]s. In the case of divine magic, these creatures were most often servants of the deific power worshiped by the summoning [[cleric]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}}\n\nThe spell ''[[vipergout]]'' also summoned fiendish [[viper]]s.\n\n[[Narzugon]]s were known to ride fiendish [[dire boar]]s into combat."
