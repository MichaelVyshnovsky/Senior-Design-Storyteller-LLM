A bog bloke was a short tree-like creature with twisted limbs. They were sometimes referred to as "self-delivering kindling" by those of Nesmé.
Bog blokes generally resembled small, dead trees. They had sets of "arms", which were actually thin, skeletal branches. 
These creatures were less intelligent than trolls, but also greatly feared fire.
Such tree-like beings were able to outpace humans. Extremely territorial, they had no qualms about attacking intruders of their boggy marshes on sight.
Bog blokes were known to dwell in the Evermoors, among trolls.
They bludgeoned foes by wildly waving their skeletal appendages, sometimes dismounting riders from their horses. As well as this, bog blokes were able to grab foes and even entangle them.
In the , Bruenor Battlehammer led his companions through the Trollmoors. Due to the presence of charred trees, they had to be on alert, as the trees could turn out to be bog blokes. When the band became worn out from their treacherous travels, Wulfgar, on instinct, lobbed Aegis-fang at a copse of darkened trees. In fact, he actually struck a bog bloke, who tried to defend itself by putting its limbs in front of it. The bog bloke was slain, and its companions fled. Even though Bruenor and his group saved many Riders of Nesmé from bog blokes, they still turned them away. This was because Bruenor traveled with a dark elf, Drizzt DoUrden, whom the riders believed was evil because of the reputation of his racial heritage.
During the rise of Obould Many-Arrows in the , trolls and bog blokes of the Trollmoors marched upon Nesmé. Proffit, a great giant two-headed troll, united these bog blokes and trolls, and they rallied under his command.
General Dagna Waybeard of Mithral Hall came to the aid of the fighters of Nesmé, particularly Galen Firth and Rannek. The combined force cut down many bog blokes, the dwarves slaying many with chops of their large axes. Lady Alustriel Silverhand even made an appearance at the battle scene, charging her magical fiery chariot toward the bog blokes. She then let loose a fireball, scorching and killing many of them. Because of this joint resistance, the trolls and bog blokes retreated to the Trollmoors.
