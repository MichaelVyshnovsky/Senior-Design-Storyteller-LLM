'''Dolphins''' were a peaceful species of aquatic mammal plentiful in the waters of [[Abeir-Toril]].

==Behavior==
Dolphins were a highly intelligent species. They were even intelligent enough that, with some training and divine inspiration, they could become [[priest]]s of some [[deities]].

==Abilities==
In addition to their eyes, dolphins viewed their surroundings by means of echolocation. A natural process of sending out an array of soundwaves that were reflected back as three-dimensional representations of their surroundings.

Dolphins were generally capable of carrying or pulling around {{SI|120|lbs.|k|long=yes}} without becoming encumbered. The heaviest load they were capable of moving was around {{SI|360|lbs.|k|long=yes}}.

==Combat==
Dolphins were a rather peaceful species and generally would only attack if they or their young were threatened. When engaging in combat dolphins acted as organized units, taking commands from a central leader. In some cases they were willing to sacrifice their lives to protect the rest of their pod.

==Ecology==
About 10% of dolphins were known to live in organized communities with other species, such as [[swordfish]] and [[narwhal]]s, and would actively work to drive evil creatures out of their territory. Such areas also tended to be devoid of [[shark]]s and [[killer whale]]s,

===Habitats===
In [[Faerûn]], dolphins could be found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], particularly the first {{SI|150|ft}} depths. They were one of the most populous creatures to inhabit it.

Beyond [[Toril]], there existed a single species of dolphin on the planet [[Athas]] and schools of dolphins on the planet [[Karpri]] that both possessed innate [[telepathy]]. Those on the planet Athas were additionally all [[psionic]] [[wild talents]], but didn't have the discipline for formal study of full psionics.

Beyond the [[material plane]], dolphins could be found in the [[River Oceanus]].<ref>
===Languages===
Dolphins communicated in a series of clicks and whistles. They could also speak [[Serusan]], as that language was in part an amalgamation of their own.
===Relationships===
[[File:Dance of the Dolphins.png|thumb|''The [[Dance of the Dolphins]] of the [[Shining Lands]].'']]
Dolphins generally had tight bonds with [[aquatic elves]] and their elderly were some of the most respected members of sea elf communities. They rarely interacted with [[triton]]s for long periods of time unless they showed some sense of fun.

Some [[water genasi]] were known to keep dolphins as pets.<ref> They were also commonly found as [[animal companion]]s of aquatic [[ranger]]s and [[bard]]s.

They also held a distant interest in humans and would warn sailors of pirates or other aquatic threats, such as [[merfolk]] and [[sahuagin]], and in some cases even come to their aid. They held great enmity towards the sahuagin as a whole, viewing them as a threat, and would often raid their communities and destroy their eggs.

When traveling with a group of aquatic or seafaring adventurers they were known to identify with the group as a whole, rather than any one individual. They were rarely noted as abandoning such groups, even in situations where it meant saving their own lives.{{Cite dragon/269/Animal Henchmen}}

Dolphins were sacred to the [[elven pantheon|elven god]] [[Deep Sashelas]] as well as the deities [[Istishia]], [[Valkur]],{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}} and [[Trishina]]. [[Priests]] of Deep Dashelas were said to have a duty to protect endangered dolphins and were required to have one as a companion in order to rise within the priesthood. However, dolphins were particularly noted as taking up the role of priests for Trishina and had a special section of [[Thalasia]] relegated for them by the goddess.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a pod of dolphins saved [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s life during his voyage from the [[Sword Coast North]] to the nation of [[Samarach]]. The infamous author sat down to dine on a bowl of [[poison]]ed [[soup]] but became distracted by nearby dolphins. When the bard returned to his meal, one of the shipmates had already consumed it and died of what was assumed a food poisoning.

==Trivia==
* The ''[[helm of underwater action]]'' had images of dolphins carved into it.
* Some sea elves were known to craft and wear jewelry that was shaped like dolphins.
* Around the Sea of Fallen Stars it was believed that a dolphin swimming alongside a ship was a sign of good luck. Consequently, around that region superstition dictated that killing a dolphin was bad luck.
* They could be found in the [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]] in [[Dambrath]] where they could be seen performing the [[Dance of the Dolphins]] every evening at dusk. This display would attract spectators from all around [[Faerûn]]. The locals thought the dolphins were responsible for the calm waters of the bay. They were allies of the [[triton]] that lived in a hidden underwater city.
* A [[silver]] statue of a leaping dolphin crowned [[Dolphin's Leap]], a temple to [[Valkur]] in the city of [[Velen]].<ref name="VGtBGII-p94>
* In the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Ring Park]] had a fountain at its heart featuring a dolphin statuary.<ref>
* In the city of [[Waterdeep]], the family estates of some [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble houses]] sported a fountain whose water spout was made to resemble a dolphin.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/07-06 - Waterdhavian Villas}}
