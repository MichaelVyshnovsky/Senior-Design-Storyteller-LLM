Rot trolls were a type of troll imbued with necrotic energy.
A rot trolls flesh peeled off from the skin as soon as it formed, and the trolls body withered constantly.
Unlike a normal troll, a rot troll eventually lost its ability to regenerate, but it still healed properly. The monster was pulsing with necrotic energy, which was emitted from its withering shape.
Due to a rot trolls rancid degeneration, standing too close to it exposed other creatures to its deadly emanations. Only acid or fire could stop this necrotic radiation.
During regeneration, a normal troll could become infected with waves of necrotic energy and form a symbiotic connection with that deathly force.
Rot trolls could be found in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North.
