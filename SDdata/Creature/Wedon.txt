'''Wedon''' were a type of [[memedi]] native to [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Wedon appeared as a [[human]] cloaked in a white sheet made from [[silk]]. The silken sheet covered their entire body.

==Combat==
Like all common memedi, wedon were harmless and avoided all combat.

==Abilities==
If a human saw a wedon, they were struck with effects similar to a ''[[fear]]'' spell.

==Society==
Wedon were solitary creatures.

==Habitat==
Wedon were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of [[Bawa]] and other islands within the [[Island Kingdoms]].

==Ecology==
Wedon portended death and destruction and were greatly feared by the peoples of Kara-Tur. Warning of their appearance in an area was often predicted by the sudden appearance of a flock of loons or [[sparrow]]s. If the flock remained in the area or actively followed an individual, the appearance of a wedon was guaranteed. An individual who witnessed this was wise to seek out a [[priest]] and seek redemption from the gods.
