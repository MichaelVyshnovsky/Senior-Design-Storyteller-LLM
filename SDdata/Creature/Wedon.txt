Wedon were a type of memedi native to Kara-Tur.
Wedon appeared as a human cloaked in a white sheet made from silk. The silken sheet covered their entire body.
Like all common memedi, wedon were harmless and avoided all combat.
If a human saw a wedon, they were struck with effects similar to a fear spell.
Wedon were solitary creatures.
Wedon were native to Kara-Tur and most often encountered on the island of Bawa and other islands within the Island Kingdoms.
Wedon portended death and destruction and were greatly feared by the peoples of Kara-Tur. Warning of their appearance in an area was often predicted by the sudden appearance of a flock of loons or sparrows. If the flock remained in the area or actively followed an individual, the appearance of a wedon was guaranteed. An individual who witnessed this was wise to seek out a priest and seek redemption from the gods.
