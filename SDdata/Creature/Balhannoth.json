        "Description": "Balhannoths had an ovoid body, six tentacles, and a large mouth of jagged teeth.",
        "Abilities": "Balhannoth were blind creatures, but capable of sensing [[magical]] energies from up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} away, whether the energies were from spells or [[magical item]]s - though they could not distinguish between the two. Though other sources claimed that they could sense prey from up to {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} away.\n\nBalhannoths were most notable for being capable of warping reality around them in a square area of up to {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} on a side for around 10 minutes. However, this was limited in its scope as they were incapable of creating objects with moving parts or magical properties. Furthermore, balhannoths could only affect nonliving objects and close inspection of objects within a warped area would reveal them to be facsimiles.\n\nBalhannoths were capable of telepathically reading other creatures minds. They would use this ability to reach out towards any intelligent creatures that got within 1 mile of their lairs and learning whatever it was they desired most. Those that did would begin feeling as though they were close to that desire and this feeling would grow stronger as they got closer to its lair. They would then use their reality warping abilities to make their lair resemble what the creature desired.\n\nOnce it lured a creature within its lair a balhannoth would grapple and teleport them anywhere within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} to begin their attack in earnest. Though if a balhannoth was not yet ready to go on the offensive, they were capable of turning invisible, altering their skin so that it blended in with their environment.",
        "Combat": "Rather than hunting for prey the balhannoth were known to be ambush predators. Balhannoth typically attacked their prey by biting with their large jagged mouths or grappling and constricting with their tentacles. While being grappled by it, a balhannoth's prey were rendered incapable of casting spells and the properties of any magical items on their person were suppressed.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Balhannoths fed on both flesh and magical auras, such as from magical items. The stronger a magical aura that a creature they feasted on possessed, the longer they would be sustained by it. They typically fed upon one magical item at a time, absorbing their energies, while storing others in their lairs within either ceiling cracks or beneath large boulders. Eventually they grew tired of the taste a magical item gave off and would feel it necessary to seek out a new one.",
            "Relationships": "[[Drow]] and many other creatures within the [[Underdark]] were known to venture into Shadowfell border crossings in search of balhannoths to enslave as they were considered excellent guards. Other Underdark races known for capturing balhannoths for use guards included [[Mindflayer]]s, [[aboleth]]s, and even [[grimlock]]s. Though some, such as [[kuo-toa]]s, instead raised balhannoths from birth.\n\nThough they could be trained to respond to spoken commands, balhannoths often responded best to telepathic communication."
