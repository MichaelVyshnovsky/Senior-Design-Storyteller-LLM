        "Description": "The chitinous bodies of these beetles had a black coloration.",
        "Abilities": "The most notable trait of these beetles was their sticky saliva, which was so adhesive it could hold fast a [[giant]]. However, a few minutes after exposure to air this saliva began to dry and lose its stickiness.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Chang Emporium]] shipped tangler beetles alongside [[bombardier beetle|bombardier]] and [[fire beetle]]s on the [[caravel]] [[Dragonfly (caravel)|''Dragonfly'']] to the city of [[New Velar]], intending to have them sold by [[Lin-Woh]] as guardian animals. However, once there an offloading accident occured, leading cages to crash to the ground and unleash many of the beetles trapped within them.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Prospect|5-6}}"
