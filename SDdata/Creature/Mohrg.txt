'''Mohrgs''' were vile [[undead]] that appeared as skeletons containing only their animated viscera.

==Creation==
They were the risen corpses of mass murderers and others who'd committed similar crimes and never atoned before they died.

A mohrg could be animated using the ''[[create undead]]'' [[spell]], but only by the most powerful casters.<ref>

==Description==
A mohrg appeared as a gaunt, even skeletal corpse with a ribcage stuffed with still-fresh internal organs, which writhed sickeningly. Most notably, the tongue was long, cartilaginous, and ended in claws. Typically, mohrgs stood 5&ndash;6 feet (1.5&ndash;1.8 meters) tall as they had in life, and weighed around 120 pounds (54 kilograms).

==Combat==
Trying to take their prey unawares, morhgs struck with their fists and grabbed hold, or else lashed them with their tongues. The very touch of their tongues could cause a being to be paralyzed for up to four minutes if they lacked the fortitude to resist.

==Abilities==
Those slain by a mohrg rose from the dead a day to four days later as [[zombie]]s in all respects. Such zombies were controlled by the mohrg.

Though similar to [[zombie]]s, mohrgs moved as fast as a living [[human]]. They had fast reflexes and skills in stealth.

==Personality==
Morhgs had an overriding hatred of all life. Yet, tormented by it, they yearned to live again themselves.

==Society==
Morhgs might be encountered alone or in gangs of up to four, and these gangs might have up to ten zombies with them.

==Lands==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], in [[Faerûn]], lone mohrgs might be encountered in the [[Channath Vale]], [[Dambrath]], and [[Veldorn]],<ref> while lone mohrgs or gangs of them might be encountered in all levels of the [[Underdark]].<ref>


==Notable Mohrgs==
* [[Kelthas|Kelthas the Dread]], an evil [[necromancer]] who returned from death as a mohrg inhabiting the lower levels under [[Mount Illefarn]].
* [[Boran Klosk]], imprisoned under the [[Temple of the Trembling Flower]] for over two hundred years, was released in the {{YearlinkName|1370}} to once again threaten [[Alaghôn]].
