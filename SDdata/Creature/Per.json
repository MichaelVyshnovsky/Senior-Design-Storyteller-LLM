        "mainbody": "'''Pers''' were a warrior race of [[outsider]]s that served the various [[deities]] of the [[Upper Planes]], primarily by acting as guardians of [[portal]]s to those [[plane]]s and of significant junctures of [[Yggdrasil]]. They were created by deities from the [[spirit]]s of [[human]]s who in life had been dedicated to a cause and many considered it a great honor to become one.",
        "Description": "Pers resembled human [[fighter]]s with muscular builds, standing {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} on average. They were typically garbed in elaborately decorated [[bronze]] or [[steel]] armor and large [[helmet]]s that were adorned were large plumes or other sorts of ornamentation. Their overall appearance was rather grim and foreboding.",
        "Personality": "Pers were rather intelligent beings, but also fanatical in their duties and would never leave their assigned post. If ever challenged, they would fight to the death. Some mistook their dutiful nature for being emotionlessness.",
        "Abilities": "All pers possessed abilities that mimicked the [[spell]]s ''[[blade barrier]]'', ''[[charm person or mammal]]'' which could be cast seven times per day, ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' which could be cast three times per day, ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', and ''[[read magic]]''. Of these powers, ''ESP'' in particular was frequently used by them as part of their duties.\n\nPers could not be harmed by any mundane weaponry, they viewed the world with [[truesight]], were difficult to surprise, and they could magically determine an opponent's fighting prowess. Due to the special nature of their existence, all pers possessed a limited mental link with the deities they served, making the power aware whenever a per was in duress or outright killed.",
        "Combat": "Each per carried a special [[sentient item|sentient]] [[two-handed sword]], imbued with the essence of a servitor of an Upper Planes deity. These swords were [[alignment|aligned]] towards [[lawful neutral]], could speak [[Common]], and were always in agreement with their per wielder, though would come into conflict with any other being that tried to wield them. In addition to carrying both a ''+3'' [[enchantment]] and an effect similar to a ''[[frostbrand]]'', they also had spell-like abilities that mimicked ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect invisible objects]]'', and ''[[detect magic]]''. The ability to detect [[good]] and [[evil]] aligned beings was frequently utilized by the per in their duties.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Pers could be found throughout much of the Upper Planes, such as in [[Elysium]],<ref> various roads on [[Mount Olympus]],<ref> and at some of the most important junctions on Yggdrasil. In the [[Krigala]] layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], a number of pers guarded ''[[color pool]]s'' that formed in and around where Yggdrasil's branches reached into the plane.",
            "Languages": "All pers spoke [[common]], but also retained the languages of the spirit they were created from.",
            "Relationships": {
                "Faerûnian pantheon": "Within the major pantheon of [[Faerûn]], pers were used as servants by [[Kelemvor]],<ref> the [[Red Knight]],<ref> and [[Savras]].<ref>",
