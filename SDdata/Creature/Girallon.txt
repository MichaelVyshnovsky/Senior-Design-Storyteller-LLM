'''Girallons''' were aggressive, carnivorous [[ape]]s with four arms. They were incredibly strong and territorial.

{{Quote|[Girallons] are savage beasts that do not understand the concept of subtlety.|[[Eku]], jungle guide}}

==Description==
An adult girallon was about {{SI|8|feet|c|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|800|pounds|k|long=yes}}. It appeared to be a four-armed ape with thick white fur and curved tusks in its mouth, distinguishing it from normal apes.

==Ecology==
These beasts lived in groups led by a dominant adult, who tended to be the oldest of the group.

===Uses===
Some primitive tribespeople were known to capture young girallons to raise them to be mounts, using many of the same techniques one would use to train an [[owlbear]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an unusually old and massive girallon known as the [[Great Ape]] was terrorizing [[Port Nyanzaru]] in Chult. The massive beast had tough scarred white hide and unprecedented aggression. A group of heroes was tasked with slaying the beast by [[Jessamine]], a [[Merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|Merchant Prince]] of Port Nyanzaru.
