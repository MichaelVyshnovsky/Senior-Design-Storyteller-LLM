Girallons were aggressive, carnivorous apes with four arms. They were incredibly strong and territorial.
An adult girallon was about  tall and weighed . It appeared to be a four-armed ape with thick white fur and curved tusks in its mouth, distinguishing it from normal apes.
These beasts lived in groups led by a dominant adult, who tended to be the oldest of the group.
Some primitive tribespeople were known to capture young girallons to raise them to be mounts, using many of the same techniques one would use to train an owlbear.
In the late 15 century DR, an unusually old and massive girallon known as the Great Ape was terrorizing Port Nyanzaru in Chult. The massive beast had tough scarred white hide and unprecedented aggression. A group of heroes was tasked with slaying the beast by Jessamine, a Merchant Prince of Port Nyanzaru.
