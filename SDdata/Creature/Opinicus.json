        "mainbody": "Opinicus () () were strange good-hearted creatures found in the deserts and ruins of Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nOpinicus appeared to be a blend of several animals. They possessed the body of a camel with the face of a monkey. They also had a lions mane and tail with eagle wings sprouting from their back. Their front paws had opposable thumbs, allowing them to grasp things like monkeys.\nMost opinicus were light brown or golden in color, with darker faces and wings.\nThese creatures were able to turn undead similar to a priest. Additionally, they possessed the following spell-like abilities holy word and heal. They could become ethereal at will.\nThe unique attack of an opinicus was a glowing gaze that created a cone of light that damaged any undead or creatures of the lower planes.\nOpinicus possessed natural psionic talents. Though they usually used them for travelling and playing pranks, they could be used during combat as well. These powers included probability travel, teleport, astral projection, dimension door, dimension walk, dream travel, teleport trigger, time/space anchor, telekinesis, animate objects, control winds, inertial barrier, and levitation.\nThough they usually avoided combat, opinicus had a strong hatred of evil creatures, especially undead and al-jahar, whom they attacked on sight. They would often come to the aid of a good cause.\nTheir sharp senses made it nearly impossible to surprise an opinicus. They were very stealthy creatures, allowing them to sneak up on others with ease.\nDuring combat, an opinicus attempted to strike an opponent with its front paws, followed up by a rake with the rear claws.\nThese creatures could live for centuries and did not have much of an influence on their habitat. They would sometimes clean the ruins they called home, or make sculptures to decorate them.\nAncient ruins were the preferred home of an opinicus. When found elsewhere, they were usually on some kind of personal mission. They enjoyed playing harmless pranks on travelers.\nThese creatures sometimes acted as servants of Aerdrie Faenya.\nMany sages believed that these creatures were initially summoned to battle vargouilles or Al-Jahar."
