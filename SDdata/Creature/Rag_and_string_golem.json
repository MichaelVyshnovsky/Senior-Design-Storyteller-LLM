        "mainbody": "Rag and string golems were a type of golem that were developed, and whose construction were taught by, the College of Shaping Magics,\nAs their name implied, these constructs were crafted from rags and string. They had a humanoid shape and stood around  tall.\nThese golems were very intelligent, being capable of receiving and carrying out very complicated instructions without flaw. They could even modify the wording of their orders in order to better achieve the intent of their instructed goal.\nRag and string golems were faithful to their creator and would only serve their orders. Though their creator could order them to serve someone else for a day.\nThese golems could be imbued with knowledge of some spells, though not rituals, and if imbued with more than one spell they had to be from the same school of magic.This section uses the term \"college,\" which comes from the tabletop role-playing game that The Shattered Statue was written to be cross-compatible with &mdash DragonQuest &mdash which are not to be confused with the university introduced in that adventure module, the College of Shaping Magics. DragonQuests concept of \"colleges of magic\" are equivalent to the schools of magic of D&D.\nThe construction of these golems involved some sort of ritual, which took roughly two hours to prepare.\nUnlike most golems, these were capable of not only understanding their creators primary language, but also conversing in it."
