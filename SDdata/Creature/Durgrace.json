        "Description": "This fish was considered to be a lucky catch due to its growth. Durgrace could grow to a massive size, a lake monster and a fisher's dream.",
        "Ecology": "They were edible and were a part of a winter's hero's feasts served during the annual [[Simril]] celebration in [[Twilight Tor]]. The feast also consisted of cooked [[brown bream]], [[blackjaw]], and [[candlefish]]."
