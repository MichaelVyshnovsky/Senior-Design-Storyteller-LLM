        "mainbody": "An '''abominable yeti''' was a huge and monstrous [[yeti]] that was several times more powerful than a regular tundra yeti.",
        "Description": "Abominable yetis were around three times taller than [[human]]s, such that were even larger than [[hill giant]]s. They were superior to other tundra yetis in almost every way, apart from being somewhat less dexterous. Abominable yetis were not just larger and stronger versions of yetis; they even had unique abilities, such as being able to breathe a freezing cone of frigid air over their enemies.\n\nThey were perceptive, and despite their towering height, were surprisingly stealthy.",
        "Personality": "Such monstrosities were hateful and predatory. They were territorial and would attack warm-blooded creatures on sight. The yetis would subsequently devour the creatures, and toss their remains across the icy plains.",
        "Combat": "Abominable yetis made very tough opponents in combat. They were even stronger than [[frost giant]]s, and could take about three times more damage than regular yetis before falling to their deaths. The most powerful ability of such yetis was to breathe a deathly cold cone of air over multiple opponents in front of them.\n\nAs with regular yetis, abominable yetis were highly inclined to the cold, and thus could resist cold-based attacks. They also feared [[fire]], which would put even the most hulking abominable yetis at a disadvantage.",
        "Society": "These yetis would often live and hunt alone, but it was not unreasonable for them to be found in pairs, usually when raising young.",
        "Notable Abominable Yetis": "* [[Thagor]], an {{SI|18|ft}} tall abominable yeti who served [[Keresta Delvingstone]] in [[Undermountain]]."
