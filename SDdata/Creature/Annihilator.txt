Annihilators were aberrations found in the Lowerdark.
The annihilators appearance resembled that of a rust monster, but had an additional set of large flexible antennae and lacked a mouth.
Annihilators found gratification in disintegrating both creatures and objects.
The antennae of an annihilator disintegrated a target. Physical contact was required and the effect was identical to that of a disintegrate spell. When an annihilator selected a target, it became obsessed with its disintegration and they were known to pursue a target over great distances.
Annihilators gained sustenance by absorbing disintegrated material
