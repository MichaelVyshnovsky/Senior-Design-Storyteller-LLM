'''Annihilators''' were [[aberration]]s found in the [[Lowerdark]].

==Description==
The annihilators appearance resembled that of a [[rust monster]], but had an additional set of large flexible antennae and lacked a mouth.

==Behavior==
Annihilators found gratification in disintegrating both creatures and objects.

==Combat==
The antennae of an annihilator disintegrated a target. Physical contact was required and the effect was identical to that of a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell. When an annihilator selected a target, it became obsessed with its disintegration and they were known to pursue a target over great distances.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Annihilators gained sustenance by absorbing disintegrated material
