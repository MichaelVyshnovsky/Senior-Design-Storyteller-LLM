'''Firebirds''' were rare non-[[elemental]] kleptomaniacal, dim-witted yet sentient relatives of [[phoenix]]es that resembled a [[humanoid]]-sized mix of a [[peacock]] and a [[bird-of-paradise]].

{{quote|''A fantastic, addled creature fashioned from ten parts tail, and two parts beak, to one part brain.''|Exerpt from ''[[The Council of Blades]]''}}

==Description==
Firebirds were huge avians the size of an average [[human]] with stubby wings. Their beautiful and bright plumage was of stunning oranges, fiery reds, and golds. Their heads crowned with silly sizable plumage, yellow eyes, long  necks and huge severe-looking curved razor beaks Firebirds' tail feathers were significantly longer than the rest of their plump bodies, similar to that of a man-sized bird-of-paradise. Firebirds' feet as well as their talons and eyes were golden yellow. The birds had very expressive faces. An average male firebird was about {{SI|6'|'"|long=yes}} long and {{SI|36'|'"|long=yes}} if one was counthing their tails.

These birds' necks housed a stretchable pouch to safekeep the shiny loot before it was regurgitated, washed, and deposited in the nest.

==Abilities==
Firebirds appeared stunningly beautiful in flight, with long tails floating through the air like [[silk]]en streams. Even though the birds were usually peaceful creatures, their talons were strong enough to easily rip through rooftops' sheet meatal.

==Personality==
{{fq
| text =''What bird could match Tekoriikii's brains? What female could resist his charms? Tekoriikii danced and danced, throwing back his head to swirl about in glee.''

These giant avians' most notable characteristic was irresistible kleptomania. They possessed no self-control and grabbed anything that glittered, like glass, [[gem]]s, [[pearl]]s, and precious jewelry. When firebirds were in pursuit of "shinies," they were known to gleefully prance while guards and city watch were out of sight.

Firebirds were also narcissists who thought themselves the smartest and most beautiful creatures, even when among others of their kin. The giant birds were often overwhelmed with joy over glittery loot or just their own magnificence, exploding into glorious songs of incomparable beauty. Or at least that was what firebirds believed. In reality, their singing was loud, cacophonic, and dangerous. The shrieking and yodeling reached frequencies beyond simple mortal's hearing. It scattered [[dog]]s in fearful howling, it spoiled [[cheese]], made [[chicken]]s mislay eggs, and crumbled stone and [[mortar]] sending [[gargoyle]]s topping down off the castles' roofs.

Firebirds showed curiosity and had limited intelligence. They were smart enough to learn, use tools, avoid [[trap]]s, and use stealth. However, they were still quite dim-witted compared to most [[humanoid]]s. These creatures liked flare and heroic posing. Firebirds rarely showed anger nor malice and often displayed curiosity towards their opponents. They were fascinated by colorful illustrated [[book]]s and could spend hours turning pages. Firebirds spoke a version of the [[Phoenix language]] that sounded especially avian. It consisted of honks, chirps, worbles, and screeches, accompanied by what only could be described as silly interpretive dance. They also could understand [[Common]].

Firebirds considered humanoids to be terribly disfigured by the lack of plumage.

==Combat==
When forced into combat, firebirds tried to intimidate their opponents rather than stooping to barbaric melee. They inflated their chests, fluffed up feathers, and angrily flapped their stubby wings. Size alone was more than enough to dissuade most from attacking these winged beasts. The loud hissing was adding to the intimidation.

Aerial combat was alien to firebirds as well. The closest thing to fighting that firebirds experienced was mating fights. The birds flew around trying to humiliate their opponents by performing the ''coup de grace'' plucking tail feathers. When confronted with real danger, dim-witted birds attempted to pluck tail feathers from opponents such as [[hippogriff]]s, or [[griffon]]s, to little success.

==Ecology==
Firebirds were believed to have inhabited the skies above the [[Shining Sea]] for many generations, living in seclusion. They did not have predators due to their size and possibly due to their foul singing. Many [[Chultan]]s knew of the fabled firebirds from legends that talked about the bird's unearthly beauty. The same tales told about gods' fury upon anyone who harmed the creatures. However, some sages believed that these legends were a mere warning for hunters not to stalk the birds as it required them to stay within earshot from the creatures for extended periods of time.

Firebirds appearance was the evidence of their carnivorous nature; however, they appreciated fruit and cheese as much as they did meats,
 and even [[salt]]ed [[ship's biscuit]]s.

==History==
{{fq
| text =''Proud, pleased, and pampered, Tekoriikii began a song - a melody that started like the nighttime murmur of priceless, winsome [[hummingbird]]s, then changed into something reminiscent of a live [[narwhal]] being fed back-ward through a [[sausage]] machine. The awful row set [[bat]]s starting up out of the eaves, caused nearby flowers to wilt, and set guard dogs howling for miles around. Feeling her hair loosen at the roots, Miliana gave a squawk of panic and frantically clamped the bird's beak shut with her hands.''

In the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, the smartest and most beautiful by his own accord, firebird named [[Tekorriikii]] followed a giant glittering gem in the night sky from his kin's habitat in the Shining Sea

The tower belonged to Princess [[Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria]] a self-taught aspiring young [[wizard]]. During one of her frustrating learning sessions, a rogue spell was discharged, causing the ceiling of her toom to collapse, along with an outraged and disheveled firebird. The duo quickly found a common group and befriended each other. With the research help from [[Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomatra]], the youth were able to determine the species of the strange sentient bird. ''[[Groonpeck's Field Guide to Terrifying Denizens of the Air, with special appendices for Acheron, the Elemental Planes, and the Abyss]]'' described their new friend exactly. Soon after, Tekorriikii accompanied the couple on a foray into the [[Festival of Blades]] where the bird was allowed to show his deadly weaponized singing against rowdy drunk nobles.

Perhaps the most notorious deed of the orange-feathered criminal was an attempt to steal the ''[[Sun Gem]]'' a giant mystical [[diamond]] that was a symbolic heart of the Blade Kingdoms. The bird was initially successful but was confronted and pursued by [[Shaatra]], a vicious hippogryph of [[Ugo Svarézi]], a Blade Captain from the city-state of [[Colletro]]. The vicious black hippogryph managed to claim the legendary gemstone and leave Tekorriikii's behind plucked and embarrassingly bare. This loss of the ''Sun Gem'' eventually led to the grand civil war in the Blade Kingdoms and Ugo Svarézi's temporary rise to power.
