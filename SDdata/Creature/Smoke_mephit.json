They were crude and lazy, as well as liars and tricksters who thrived on mockery and misdirection.\nSmoke mephits had sharp claws, which they used to attack their enemies.\nSmoke mephits could fly as fast as they could move on land. They had a complete immunity against fire and poison.\nThey had an ability called cinder breath, which consisted of smoldering ash, that blinded those caught in it.\nWhen a smoke mephit died, a cloud of smoke with a radius of  appeared. This cloud obscured the vision of other creatures.\nSmoke mephits could cast dancing lights once per day.\nSmoke mephits could summon one to four other smoke mephits once per day. These smoke mephits appeared within  and disappeared after 1 minute, when the summoning smoke mephit died, or when the summoner released it. This ability worked only once every four times.\nSmoke mephits were servants of Vhaeraun, the drow god of thievery, and were sent by him to Toril.\n* Ehkahk, self-proclaimed ruler of the Paraelemental Plane of Smoke."
