'''Woodspiders''' were a variety of [[spider]]s mutated through magic by the [[Church of Lolth]] long before the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Combat==
Like their mundane kin, woodspiders possessed a [[venom]]ous bite. As they were creatures of living wood, they were resistant to all bludgeoning damage but were slightly more vulnerable to flames and lightning. They were also unaffected by ''[[charm]]'' and ''[[illusion]]'' magics.

==Ecology==
Woodspiders dwelled in underground areas in lairs, thickly draped in odd spiderwebs. Their webs were brown in color and mushy yet brittle like dry twigs. The webs were highly flammable.

==History==
Woodspiders were a creation of the [[priest]]s of [[Lolth]] within the [[Temple of Lolth (Vast)|Temple of Lolth]] near the trail that led to the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]], dating back many years before the late 14{{th}} century DR. The priests were altering the ''[[sticks to snakes]]'' [[spell]] to find way to create [[giant spider]]s from simple sticks. Still, the research was not as successful as they hoped. The living creatures of the wood, woodspiders, murdered all the researchers but eventually were subdued, and priests attempted to domesticate them. For one reason or another, woodspiders were left behind when the Temple of Lolth was abandoned.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, a group of heroes of the [[Living City]] was tasked with finding and exploring the ruined temple, where they came across these strange wooden arachnids who guarded a collection of rare [[book]]s that included the ''[[Cookbooks of the Underdark]]'' and a ''[[spellbook]]'' of the [[drow]] [[mage]] named [[Rouarthek]].
