A crystalich was a rare form of lich created when a powerful diviner or sibylite merged their spirit with a scrying device, transforming themselves into a sentient crystal ball.
Crystaliches could scry anywhere in Faer√ªn and on any plane of existence they desired. Furthermore, they could cast spells within any location they were scrying.
A trio of crystaliches was believed to inhabit the Hall of Pools and Mirrors buried deep within Candlekeep.
