A '''crystalich''' was a rare form of [[lich]] created when a powerful [[diviner]] or [[sibylite]] merged their spirit with a scrying device, transforming themselves into a sentient [[crystal ball]].

==Powers==
Crystaliches could scry anywhere in [[Faer√ªn]] and on any [[plane of existence]] they desired. Furthermore, they could cast [[spell]]s within any location they were scrying.

==History==
A trio of crystaliches was believed to inhabit the [[Hall of Pools and Mirrors]] buried deep within [[Candlekeep]].
