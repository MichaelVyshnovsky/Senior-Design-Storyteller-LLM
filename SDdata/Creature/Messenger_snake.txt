'''Messenger snakes''' were a type of [[flying snake]] that were specifically bred by the [[Zhentarim]]. They were not a naturally occurring species, rather the product of [[magic]]al experimentation.

==Description==
About {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} long in length, these snakes were covered in metallic green scales. While they closely resembled the aerial serpents native to [[Chult]], they had the distinction of having feathered wings that were similar to those of a [[parrot]].

==Behavior==
While they were often tasked with carrying written messages or parcels, up to {{SI|2|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight, they could also recite up to one hundred words per assignment.

==Abilities==
They flew with near silence and possessed a potent form of camouflage that was effective even in flight.

Messenger snakes were capable of understanding and mimicking basic [[human]] languages. To aid them in their duties, they were imbued with the powers to [[find the path|readily locate their desired locations]] and [[detect lie|uncover any falsehoods]] while speaking with others.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, newly hatched messenger snakes were worth about 2,500 [[gp]]. Their eggs were valued upwards of 1,000 [[gp]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Messenger snakes were most commonly found near settlements and strongholds occupied by [[Zhent]]s and agents of the Zhentarim.
===Relationships===
Beyond their use by the Zhentarim, messenger snakes were a [[favored monster]] of the [[deity]] [[Vergadain]] and often served him.
===Usage===
Beyond their namesake purpose of carrying messages and parcels, messenger snakes were known to be eaten in the land of [[Thar]] and considered to be quite a delicacy.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that after their inception messenger snakes developed heightened intelligence and even formed a language of their own.
