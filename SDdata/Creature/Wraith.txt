A '''wraith''' was an [[undead]] creature born of evil and darkness, despising light and all living things.
{{Quote|''Death. We are death shrouded in darkness. Sweet, sweet darkness.''|The wraith that took the form of [[Brenna Graycloak]].}}

==Description==
Wraiths were powerless in natural sunlight, appearing as a sinister, spectral figure robed in darkness. They had no visual features or appendages, except for their glowing red eyes.

==Abilities==
They could drain the life from living creatures, turning them into new wraiths upon death.

Wraiths became far weaker when under the exposure of full [[the sun|sunlight]].

Like many undead, wraiths possessed a chilling touch. However, these beings were most similar in nature to the undead known as [[wight]]s. Both could drain creatures of their life energy and could only be harmed by either [[silver]] or [[item enchantment|enchanted]] weaponry.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], wraiths, moon wraiths, and wisp wraiths  could be found in the company of [[Shadovar]].

==Variants==
;Moon Wraiths
:A crescent-shaped wraith that arose from [[lycanthrope]]s who had died while in the midst of transforming. They used hit-and-run tactics, flying through their enemies in a crescent arc as often as they could.
;Wisp Wraiths
:A type of wraith that resulted from humanoids killed by a wraith failing to form correctly into a true wraith. These were weaker than other types of wraith. They typically crowded around their opponents, using their necrotic powers to slow them down.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Though they could be found on the [[Prime Material plane]], wraiths were far more prominent in the [[Negative Energy plane]]. They were typically encountered in places that were dark and gloomy, away from the debilitating rays of the sun.

===Relationships===
Being a type of undead connected to Negative Energy plane, wraiths acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deities]] [[Jergal]], [[Kiaransalee]], and the [[Chult]]an [[demigod]] [[Eshowdow]].<ref>

===Usage===
Some were known to use the dust left behind by destroyed wraiths as a [[material component]] for the [[spell]] ''[[wraithform]]''.{{Cite dragon/147/Variety the Spice of Magic|25}} This [[wraith residue]] was a shadowy ichor, sometimes used in creation of magic items, and sold for over 370 [[gold]] [[coin]]s per a single pouch.

==Notable Wraiths==
* [[Brysis]]
