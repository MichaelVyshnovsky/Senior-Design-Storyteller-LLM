        "mainbody": "Spectral wizards were a rare form of incorporeal undead created from living spellcasters by use of the create spectral wizard spell.\nSpectral wizards were only made from humans, elves, and gnomes.\nAs ethereal creatures, spectral wizards could only be harmed by enchanted or silver weapons. Their touch could paralyze their opponent. Their undead nature made them completely immune to any spell involving sleep, hold, fear, cold, charm, polymorph, paralyze, or death magic effects. They could be turned as common spectres.\nSpectral wizards were created from once living spellcasters. As such they had access to the same spells they used as living beings.\nWith extreme effort spectral wizards were able to solidify themselves enough to manipulate physicial objects.\nA spectral wizards impact on their surroundings was dictated by the wizard who created them with the create spectral wizard spell. All spectral wizards were magically compelled to follow the commands of their creator."
