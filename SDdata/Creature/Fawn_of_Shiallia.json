        "mainbody": "Fawns of Shiallia were celestial, youthful deer and servitors of the goddess Shiallia. She sometimes had them manifest on the Prime Material as a token of her favor.\nThese creatures had the appearance of youthful deer, sported greenâ€“hued coats of fur, and were surrounded by small motes of light. They were sometimes encountered with neck adornments such as bells and bows.\nThese creatures had a gentle nature to them.\nThe fawns of Shiallia emitted a magical aura that would heal the injuries and wounds of friendly creatures within their proximity.\nSometime in the late 15 century DR, at the festival of Simril, a number of adventurers in the Sword Coast were bestowed a fawn of Shiallia as a companion."
