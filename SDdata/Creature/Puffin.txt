Puffins were a species of seabirds found in Alpuk, and, before the region was overtaken by the High Ice, in the Rengarth Tundra.
The feathers of a puffin were predominantly black, except for a white mask, and their fat beaks were yellow. They were described as knee-high.
Puffins communicated with jabbering vocalizations, and spent much of their time gossiping and arguing with each other, fighting amongst themselves, and procreating. They were also known to tumble and slide down mud slopes on their bellies.
Puffin nesting grounds were known as rookeries.
The Iulutiuns considered puffins to be among their favorite foods, and ate them raw, whilst the aevendrow community of Callidae raised puffins for their eggs, much like chickens.
