        "mainbody": "'''Brambles''' were a small race of evil [[fey]].",
        "Description": "Brambles were a [[humanoid]] looking race that on average grew to be {{SI|3|in|c}} tall. Their skin was dark and wrinkled, they had long pointed finger and toe nails, and their ears pointed to a degree beyond that of [[elves]]. A brace of spines stuck out from their backs, that looked as though they could support miniature [[dragon]] wings.\n\nMany of the features of brambles were hidden beneath [[plate mail]] armor that they typically wore. This armor was covered in artificial spines and barbs that harmed those who touched them. It also had holes through which their wine-spine poked out of.",
        "Personality": "Brambles were considered to be among some of the vicious and aggressive races of fey. They were supremely confident when dealing with taller creatures, such as [[human]]s, who they considered to be \"giants\". They would think nothing of challenging a \"giant\" to a wrestling match and rarely honored any bets they made regarding them.\n\n[[File:Bramble-2.png|thumb|273px|''A bramble leers back at someone, showing off their long wing-spines.'']]",
        "Biology": "Some brambles were known to secrete a strong [[poison]] from their wing-spines that caused a painful burning sensation.",
        "Abilities": "Brambles were capable of casting the [[spell]] ''[[charm mount]]''. One in ten brambles were also known to be capable of casting a special spell of ''anti-flying'' once per day. While they sometimes used the latter for the purpose of hunting, they especially liked to cast it on flying faeries like [[pixie]]s and [[sprite]]s so they could cruelly chase them through the woods.",
        "Combat": "Though brambles occasionally wielded weapons in the form of barbed [[spear]]s that they used like [[javelin]]s, they largely attempted to use hurl themselves at their opponents and harm them with their barbed armor. Whenever faced with an opponent that was {{SI|1|ft}} tall or smaller, they would try to wrestle them.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some rumors alleged that the bramble race began as outcasts of more \"polite\" faerie society, most likely descending from [[gorse]]s.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Brambles were an omnivorous species of fey.",
            "Homelands": "Brambles were typically found to live in grasslands, hills, and prairies in regions with a temperate or subarctic climate. When not traveling they camped within thorny bushes and other forms of natural protection, using their mounts as guards.",
            "Languages": "In addition to the language of fey, brambles had a slim understanding of the Elven language.",
            "Relationships": "Brambles were a [[favored monster]] of the deity [[Lolth]] and the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]].",
            "Usage": "It was possible to drain the poison from a bramble's wing-spines, but the output was applicable for little more than an [[arrow]]head or a [[dart]]. It would take over ten or more to coat something larger like a [[longsword]]. In addition, some collectors were willing to pay a lot of money for a set of their unique armor."
