A '''cyclopskin''' ({{Pronounce|SY|klops|kin|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}|audio=Cyclopskin.ogg}}) was a smaller version of a [[cyclops]].

==Description==
The typical cyclopskin stood around {{SI|7'5"|ft-in|long=yes}} and weighed around {{SI|350|lbs.|k}}.{{Cite dragon/254/The Ecology of the Cyclopskin|102-104}}

They typically dressed in dirty garments that were made of animal hide.

==Combat==
In combat, most cyclopskin preferred to use [[bardiche]]s, [[club]]s, over-sized [[sling]]s, and [[spear]]s. The latter two were only used when needing to attack from afar or when out hunting. Because of their poor depth perceptions, cyclopskin were not good with did not use missile weapons. Thus, unlike other [[giant-kin]], they were not skilled with throwing boulders.

==History==
All cyclopskin believed they descended from the strong line of [[Annam]], but most giants suspected these runts came from one of [[Othea]]'s affairs.

==Society==
Much like their larger cousins, cyclopskin had a highly patriarchal society, with women and children being subservient to men. The strongest among them generally assumed the leadership role and were most often killed by other members of their clan who had grown bitter from mistreatment.

Cyclopskin generally lived alone or traveled in small bands looking for prey and suitable captives.
===Lycanthropy===
Cyclopskin were known to be susceptible to all forms of [[lycanthropy]] and retained their distinctive single eye regardless of which form they took.{{Cite dragon/266/Dragon's Bestiary: Giant Lycanthropes}}
===Homelands===
A number of such bands lived in [[Starspur]] in the [[Starspire Mountains]] of [[Tethyr]]. They were also known to occasionally be found in the eastern region of the [[Hordelands]].
