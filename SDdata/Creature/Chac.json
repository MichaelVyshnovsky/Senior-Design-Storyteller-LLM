However, they could also stand on two legs, and when doing so looked similar to a werejaguar.\nBecause of their affinity to water, chacs constantly had tears trickling down their cheeks. Chacs were also associated with different colors depending on where they lived, and their eyes were the appropriate color. Chacs had blue eyes in northern Maztica, red in south Maztica, black in the east, yellow in the west, and green in central Maztica.\nChacs preferred to avoid physical combat, instead using their powerful water magic to protect themselves if necessary. They were capable of controlling the weather near their lairs as well. Chacs could also assume a gaseous form.\nChacs were peaceful, reclusive creatures who lived in caves high in the mountains. They could eat a variety of things, including meat and cocoa beans, but got most of their nourishment from water. They mated by assuming gaseous form and merging, with a cub being born one year later. Nearby chacs would celebrate the birth by gathering together and creating a great rainstorm. Chacs lived for about a century, and the death of one was marked by a several-week-long drought in the area.\nChacs avoided intelligent humanoids, mainly because chacs were sometimes captured and forced to create rain, or killed for their skin and claws, which were useful in hishna magic"
