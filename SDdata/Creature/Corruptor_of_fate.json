        "mainbody": "'''Corruptors of fate''', or simply '''corruptors''', were [[yugoloth]] assassins that specialized in inflicting suffering and death. Creatures of ill-omen, the destiny-twisting daemons lurked silently in the shadows until striking, accompanied by the sound of rolling [[dice]].",
        "Description": "Corruptors of fate were {{SI|5|ft}} tall, corpulent creatures, although faster than their paunchy {{SI|200|lb|k}} bodies would suggest. Given that both males and female had bosom-like rolls of fat, most assumed them to be female, although there was apparently enough of a difference that someone with a good eye could tell males and female apart. In contrast to their chubbiness, a corruptor of fate's skin was a sickly shade of yellow and was stretched tightly across their skulls, giving them the appearance of being gaunt when looking only at their faces.\n\nMost wore black-studded [[leather armor]], though their clothing did little to hide their smell. Despite all yugoloths smelling faintly of brimstone, a corruptor of fate's biological body odor was strong enough to make a substantial difference when tracking it, but to most the smell was only really noticeable when they started physically exerting themselves. Other disturbing traits included their luridly glowing eyes and the minor sound of rolling dice that accompanied them wherever they went, a telepathic [[illusion]] they couldn't control and which like their smell was only noticeable if they did something like fighting.",
        "Personality": "Corruptors of fate were interesting [[fiend]]s since their [[evil]] qualities were at least partially influenced by nurture, or rather lack thereof, as well as nature. Though they already had a desire to kill, this homicidal feeling was honed through their abusive upbringing, the torment they suffered at the hands of others leading them to feel a deep-seated hatred towards all other beings, especially other corruptors of fate. The exception to their loathing was [[construct]]s and [[undead]], preferably intelligent ones like [[wraith]]s, or even [[shadow]]s.\n\nThey were fundamentally self-centered, learning from a young age that if they didn't look after their own needs then no one else would, and they had a strong self-preservation instinct. However, they were also a mercantile servitor race that was happiest when working under others. They took their assignments extremely seriously and while they weren't above occasionally breaking rules or double-crossing their leaders, particularly if they stood to profit from doing so, they weren't the kind of beings to take power for themselves.",
        "Abilities": "As their name would imply, corruptors of fate had the power to manipulate luck, specifically using their [[necromancy|necromantic]] abilities to spread jinxes and misfortune to those around them. The cursed touch of a corruptor of fate, or anything they were holding, had about a half chance to leave the target so plagued by bad luck that they couldn't properly perform certain actions. Conversely, those who tried to attack corruptors of fate regularly missed, and even successful assaults seemed less effective against them than they should have been, a result of their unluckiness protecting them from others. A corruptor of fate's mere glance was dangerous, capable of harming and bringing temporary ill-fortune to those that met the gaze of their evil eye.",
        "Combat": "Mentally, ordinary corruptors of fate were as capable as the average [[human]], although they favored the use of cunning tactics. Having been raised in an environment where hiding ones presence was essential, the merits of stealth were essential to their method of fighting, and they frequently trained not only as [[rogue]]s but as [[assassin]]s. Their pragmatic outlook and survival instinct led them to retreat when obviously outmatched, with intent to come back shortly with some new advantage like reinforcements. They invested their resources into gaining armor and weapons, such as [[shortsword]]s and [[shortbow]]s, as well as a few [[potion]]s, assassins typically carrying a few vials of their favorite poisons.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "On rare occasions, corruptor of fates became [[cleric]]s but they didn't receive their [[divine]] powers from the worship of a [[god|deity]]. Instead, they had faith in their racial philosophy of spreading murder and misfortune.\n\nThey typically chose from the [[Death domain|Death]], [[Evil domain|Evil]] and [[Luck domain]]s, although those from [[Faerun]] also had access to the [[Fate domain|Fate]] and [[Hatred domain]]s.",
            "Language": "Corruptor of fate names were typically negative in nature, synonymous with disaster or corruption. Examples included Malefactor, Malfeasance, Malice, Malign, Misfortune, Calamity or Twisted Fate."
        },
        "Ecology": "Corruptors of fate were [[Gehenna]]n natives but also known to inhabit [[Banehold]], go on raids in [[Hammergrim]] and enter the Prime Material Plane through [[portal]]s.\n\nFor about a week each year, adult corruptors, for the only times in their lives, sought out others of their kind, returning to Gehenna to mate. Corruptors had no maternal emotions, and so infants were left in a Gehennan crèche, a combination nursery and orphanage for the abandoned children, run by the yugoloth leader that would become their first patron. The young corruptors would be raised by constructs or undead slaves, the closest thing to a maternal figure in their lives, that dealt with only their most basic needs, protected them from external threats, and occasionally stopped fights if their charges might end up killing each other, a relatively easy task given their immunity to the youths' necromantic abilities.\n\nCorruptor newborns had the basic body proportions of their adult counterparts, their fatness being a natural bodily feature and unrelated to their levels of consumption. Their childhoods were difficult and painful, older corruptors tormenting their weaker siblings or any other vulnerable creatures and their guardians being, at best, ambivalent to their fates. The young corruptors fostered their hatred but learnt to avoid notice and take care of themselves before reaching maturity at ten years old and leaving the crèche to begin their mercenary careers."
