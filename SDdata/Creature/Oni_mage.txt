'''Oni mages''', often called '''ogre mages''' or simply '''oni''',

==Description==
Such creatures stood at around {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|700|pounds|k|long=yes}}.

==Combat==
Oni mages were versatile [[giant]]s that combined physical and magical prowess in combat, using their natural strength to deal out significant amounts of damage while relying on their [[regeneration]] ability to shrug off wounds. When they found themselves in real danger, they ducked out of combat quickly using ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[gaseous form]]'', or even used their ability of flight.

==Society==

===Relationships===
Since they generally coveted magic, oni were often known to work for [[evil]] [[wizard]]s and [[hag]]s in exchange for useful [[magical item]]s.

Some [[potion]]-brewers were known to use parts of oni mages for a wide variety of potions. Their teeth could be used as an ingredient in brewing [[potion of gaseous form|potions of gaseous form]], their blood could be used to brew [[potion of healing|potions of healing]], and a special gland could be used in brewing [[potion of growth|potions of growth]].

==Notable Oni Mages==
* A mated pair of ogre mages, [[Sythillis]] and [[Cyrvisnea]], ruled the [[Sythillisian Empire]] from the [[Small Teeth]] mountain range.<ref>
* [[Gornak]], the owner of the [[Hand of Vaprak]], who impersonated the sage [[Gondal]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite comic/Converging Lines}}
