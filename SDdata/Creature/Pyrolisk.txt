The '''pyrolisk''' was a close relative of the [[cockatrice]] that enjoyed causing mayhem.

==Description==
Pyrolisks were very similar, visually, to cockatrices: a chicken-like creature about {{SI|3|ft}} tall, with golden-brown feathers, bright red eyes, red comb and wattle, grey, batlike wings, yellow beak, and a green, lizard-like tail tipped with a few feathers. There were a few subtle differences in that pyrolisks had a reddish cast to their wings and a single red feather on the tail.

==Behavior==
Pyrolisks were malevolent creatures that reveled in spreading mayhem.

==Abilities==
Anyone who met the gaze of a pyrolisk would burst into flames unless they resisted through force of will or were themselves immune to fire. Pyrolisks, naturally, were immune to fire, and could also cause any fire within {{SI|30|ft}} of them to burst into fireworks, similar to the ''[[pyrotechnics]]'' spell.

Hatchling pyrolisks lacked the gaze attack of adults, but could already use ''pyrotechnics''.

==Ecology==
Pyrolisks were omnivores that lived in temperate to tropical lands. They were aggressive enough to attack most other creatures they came across, but [[phoenix]]es in particular were their mortal enemies.

Pyrolisks were recorded to live in the [[starwood]] regions of [[Cormanthor]], where they were known to take over termite pits as nesting sites. The mother pyrolisk would eat all the adult termites, lay one or two speckled eggs, scatter some shiny objects around for decoration, only to leave once they hatched; the hatchling pyrolisks then fed upon the termite larvae until they could hunt for themselves (a period lasting a few weeks). The [[owlbear]]s that also hunted in termite pits despised the trespassing pyrolisks but left them alone.

Pyrolisk bones radiated heat even after the pyrolisk was dead.<ref>
