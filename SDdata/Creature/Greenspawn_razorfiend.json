On average, adults weighed  Greenspawn razorfiend scales were a dirty green color that helped them blend in with forest pools. These dragonspawns wings were useless for flight, but were razor-sharp and resembled knife blades when folded.\nGreenspawn razorfiends were among the first spawn created by Tiamat, and they were used as guards in her armies. Razorfiends were also placed in select regions to harass settlements and travelers.\nGreenspawn razorfiends were cunning hunters that enjoyed the killing of prey as much as the hunt. They preferred to live in warm or temperate forests and marshes, such as Chondalwood and the Vast Swamp. While hunting, greenspawn razorfiends would hide in water or undergrowth before attacking.\nLike some other dragonspawn, greenspawn razorfiends were capable of procreating on their own. A pair of razorfiends mated for life, and the female would lay three to six eggs every year. Mates then took turns hunting and guarding the nest."
