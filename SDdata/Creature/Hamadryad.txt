A '''hamadryad''' was an extremely rare creature that lived in secluded forests.{{Cite dragon/101/Creature Catalog III|47}}

==Description==
These highly intelligent [[fey]] considered themselves the protectors of nature, aided woodland creatures and promoted peace within forested areas. Hamadryads belonged to specific [[oak]] [[tree]]s, which were very old and large, but unlike [[dryad]]s, were free to leave the trees' immediate areas. The tree [[spirit]]s took the forms of attractive [[human]] or [[elf]] females, but with green eyes and hair.

Hamadryads were not carnivorous, omnivorous, or even herbivorous. Instead, they were very much like plants, only requiring nourishment from their hair (which contained chlorophyll, hence the color) and water. If hamadryads found themselves imprisoned in darkness, or had their hair cut off, they would die of malnutrition.

==Personality==
Hamadryads were polite and kind to those who respected their woodland homes. They rarely spoke directly with the goodly races, such as humans.

Those who ventured into the outside world were commonly driven by vengeful aims, and sought retribution for the destruction of their homeland.

==Combat==
Being proficient spellcasters, the creatures generally fought with an array of [[spell]]s. They used mind- and nature-based spells, such as ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[speak with plants]]'', ''[[animal friendship]]'', and ''[[entangle]]''. Hamadryads were also skilled with short [[weapon]]s, such as [[dagger]]s, but much preferred to use their [[magic]]al abilities. They combined these abilities with ''[[dimension door]]'' to hop between trees, confusing their foes.

==Society==
Much of the existence of hamadryads revolved around forest environments and the species within. They could speak several languages to communicate with other creatures, such as [[treant]]s and ordinary dryads. Due to their commitment to their home and their corresponding oak, they very seldom journeyed elsewhere. Those who did not respect the forest, such as lumberjacks, found themselves charmed by the fey creatures, who made them perform some sort of service to their woodland homes.

They were known to dwell in several places in [[Faerûn]], including the [[Cloakwood]], [[Sembia]], [[Cormyr]], and the [[Dales]]. Many hamadryads were worshipers of the gods of the [[Seelie Court]] or the [[Seldarine]], such as the elven deity [[Corellon]], but some came to the call of [[Sheela Peryroyl]] or other deities.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that a hamadryad's touch could cure [[nilbog|nilbogism]].

==Notable Hamadryads==
