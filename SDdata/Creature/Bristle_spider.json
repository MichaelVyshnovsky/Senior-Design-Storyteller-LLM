        "mainbody": "'''Bristle spiders''' were a species of monstrously sized [[spider]], covered in needle-like bristles, that emerged in the Realms following the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Abilities": "These spiders could spray their prey with an [[acid]]ic [[poison]] and launch a barrage of their body's bristles. They could also [[tremorsense|detect and precisely locate vibration]]s in their surroundings.",
        "Combat": "When confronting prey a bristle spider would launch a barrage of their bristles, disorienting and temporarily blinding them, and would then move in to spray them with their acidic poison.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Bristle spiders were known to be found either in vast, overgrown jungles or underground.",
            "Relationships": "These creatures were prized by both [[drow]] and [[ettercap]]s as guardians and companions, though other intelligent races were known to train them as well. In particular, [[oni]] trained them to serve as guardians and [[mount]]s.\n\nFor the sake of attacking prey, wild bristle spiders would often ally themselves with drow or [[drider]]s."
        },
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], bristle spiders could be found beneath the ruins of [[Cragmire Keep]], inside the [[Cragmire]] family's crypts, Around that time they could also be found in the pit fights conducted by the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] in [[Vellosk]]."
