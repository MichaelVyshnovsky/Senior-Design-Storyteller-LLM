Jariliths were powerful tanarri demons considered some of the most dangerous hunters in the Abyss.
Jariliths resembled large male lions with slightly oversized teeth and claws. Their demonic nature was made evident by their blood-red fur.
Jariliths were hunters, and their natural gifts broadly reflected that they were exceptionally good at hiding and moving silently, were comfortable in a variety of terrains ranging from forest to desert and wastes (or the versions thereof found in the Abyss), and had both darkvision and a keen sense of smell. They had at-will magical abilities that were similar to the spells clairaudience/clairvoyance, darkness, detect good, detect thoughts, and doom. In addition, once each day a jarilith could attempt to summon another jarilith to its aid.
Shaped as they were by nightmares, their very presence inspired fear. But their primary weapons were themselves like great cats they stalked, and pounced, and rended their prey apart with claw and fang.
Like all tanarri, jariliths were native to the Abyss, where they preferred hunting other demons. They were difficult to control and could sense weakness in others, and to them even other demons seemed weak. They were recorded to live alone, in pairs, or in prides of up to ten adults. They understood the Abyssal language but did not speak among themselves they communicated via telepathy.
Jariliths were among the creatures used as hunting beasts by more powerful entities visiting the Abyssal layer of Spirac.
A number of jariliths served the Lords of Dust as they plotted to free the Spinner of Shadows in Eberron, and also defended the Spinner in her prison when the Church of the Silver Flame attempted to stop her from escaping.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR, jariliths were among the summoned monsters used as gladiatorial beasts in the Underdark Arena of the red dragon Aptoryx.
