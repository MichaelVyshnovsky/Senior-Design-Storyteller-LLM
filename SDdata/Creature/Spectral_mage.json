        "mainbody": "Spectral mages were a rare form of incorporeal undead created from living arcane spellcasters.\nThough they were recognizable as the person they were while alive, spectral mages faces were haunted by the horror of their existence, and they were wasting and tired-looking. Though they appeared to bear the same magical items as they did while alive, these were only ghostly replicas.\nBeing completely incorporeal, spectral wizards were extremely difficult to harm their very essence deflected blows. Unlike other incorporeal creatures, however, spectral wizards were able to manipulate objects with some difficulty, though they were limited to what the mage hand spell could otherwise accomplish. This was still enough to let them prepare spells from their spellbook (were they to have used one in life), handle material components for spells, and use some magical items. Also unlike other incorporeal creatures, their incorporeal touch could not inflict any physical damage instead it caused paralyzation, for a span of maybe a minute.\nThe link to their lives gave them a resistance to being turned akin to that of a spectre. It also gave them a link to all their possessions in life a spectral mage was capable of determining their exact position without any difficulty simply by concentrating. They also had particular weaknesses, as they were always at moderate risk of mental breakdown under the stress of combat. This affected them in a manner much like a confusion spell, taking effect within about fifteen seconds of combat starting.\nSpectral wizards could no longer advance in their craft, but some of them could grow stronger as undead spirits instead nonetheless.\nThough they played no role in the ecology, spectral wizards spooked any living animals. None would approach within  those forced to would fall prey to panic."
