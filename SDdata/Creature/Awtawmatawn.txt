'''Awtawmatawn''' was a unique, larger than average [[stone golem]] possessed by a [[horned devil]].

{{Quote|I live! I live! Hear me world of mortals: I live again. This time none shall stop me!|[[Rotbite]] speaking through Awtawmatawn, following its reconstruction.}}

==Description==
Awtawmatawn was said to be as large as the [[Statue-That-Walk]] of [[Mulhorand]], Its eyes were carved from glass.

==Abilities==
Due to [[Rotbite]]'s natural resistance to magic, the [[spell]] ''[[detect evil]]'' could not recognize his presence within the statue. While inside the golem, he was also capable of casting ''[[fear]]'' in a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} radius and ''[[slow]]'' on any creature within {{SI|1|in}} of it.

Rotbite was capable of casting the following spells through the golem while possessing it: ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[infravision (spell)|infravision]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''.

And finally, Rotbite had the power to enact a number of [[psionic]] powers through the golem while possessing it. In terms of psionic attack modes, he had access to ''[[ego whip]]'' and ''[[mind thrust]]''. When it came to psionic defense modes, he could use ''[[mental barrier]]'', ''[[mind blank (psionic)|mind blank]]'', and ''[[thought shield]]''.

==History==
Sometime in the mid-12{{th}} DR,{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}} the [[College of Shaping Magics]] was tasked by King [[Proster Obarskyr]] of [[Cormyr]] with designing a new variant of [[stone golem]]s to help expedite his ambitious building projects after a student at the school by the name of [[Valmous]] promised he could construct something to rival the Statues-That-Walk of Mulhorand. These projects included such things as bridges 

The Awtawmatawn was the first of these, its name being the term that would have been used for the golems as a whole. Just as it was in its final stages, a spell backfired on Valmous. This caused a minor [[devil]] named Rotbite to be [[summon]]ed to the [[Prime Material plane]], who proceeded to possess the inert golem. The possessed golem proceeded to slaughter all the residents of the College, who were unprepared for such an attack. Except for Valmous himself, who escaped in a gravely injured state to the nearby [[College of Rune Magics]].

As the Awtawmatawn made its way to the other college, it came across and destroyed the villa of [[Lord Volkumburgh]]. When it finally came to confront its creator, Valmous used his intimate knowledge of the golem to help the residents of the College of Rune Magics defend against his creation. They managed to destroy the Awtawmatawn, but ultimately the college was left in ruin and only a few survived.

In the aftermath of that battle, Valmous and the remaining [[rune magic]] practitioners scattered the pieces of Awtawmatawn. They entrusted one of its hands with Lord Volkumburgh. While Valmous himself hid its head within a volcanic vent inside the abandoned [[Temple of the Dragon Oracle]].

Sensing the aura of the horned devil still within the fragments of the golem, they knew that it could wreak havoc one day if it were to ever be re-assembled. Thus they chose to use a combination of their rune magic and the [[magic item]]s of Valmous to place him into a healing stasis in a cave behind the College of Rune Magics. Thereby allowing him to arise in the future if ever there came a day when someone tried to reconstruct his creation. As he slept, he had one of the golem's eyes clutched in his arms.

Over time the golem and its creator would both become legendary, but its fiendish possession would be unknown.

In [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} a man named [[Lychor]] introduced the [[wizard]] [[Amelior Amanitas]] to the fragmented legend of this golem, as well as some fragments of it which he managed to merge back together into an arm through use of [[potion]]s. After doing so they gave off a [[magic]]al aura. He then became obsessed with the legend, thinking of the fame he would receive, though he would pass it off as being for the betterment of society.

Unbeknownst to Amelior, Lychor was secretly working on behalf of the [[Zhentarim]]. The organization hoped to unleash the golem's destructive capabilities upon both [[Cormyr]] and [[the Dalelands]]. While living in Volkumburg's only inn, the [[Crimson Wyrm]], to keep an eye on his efforts Lychor was also making duplicates of Amelior's plans and notes.<ref>

Amelior's efforts to reconstruct the golem

Amelior later discovered one of the statue's feet ({{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length) in a temple in [[Suzail]], which locals mistakenly believed to be a piece of [[Grumbar]]. In the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]], some time before the [[Feast of the Moon]], he arranged for the foot to be shrunken down, stolen, and then delivered to him by a group of [[adventurer]]s in Suzail. Estimating where the other fragments might be, he then tasked them with seeking out the rest of the fragments. During this quest the adventurers would find themselves ambushed by the followers of Valmous, who referred to them as the "evil ones" and "bringers of doom," but they managed to fend them off.

The adventurers went on to recover one of the golem's lost hands, hidden beneath a fountain in the village. Then with the unseen aid of Rotbite they uncovered an eye and arm of the golem within a secret cavern of the College of Rune Magics. By disturbing their rest, the adventurers awoke Valmous. He confronted the adventurers and tried to convince them to abandon their quest, but it was to no avail.

Finally, the adventurers retrieved two halves of his leg from the College of Shaping Magic<ref> and his head from the Temple of the Dragon Oracle.<ref> The awakened Valmous tried to stop them from taking the head, but Lychor managed to drive him off while hiding in the shadows.

A week after the collected parts were turned in to Amelior, Valmous and his disciples attacked the village alongside an army of neanderthals, seeking to destroy the Awtawmatawn. At the same time, Lychor unleashed a counter-force of [[undead]] in hopes of both protecting the golem and claiming it for himself. This horde of undead included a hundred [[skeleton]]s, twenty [[zombie]]s, and ten [[wight]]s. Though Lychor fought against both armies, making him appear to be the village's defender.

During this siege the Awtawmatawn's head was lowered on to its body by means of [[block and tackle]]. Once it connected the head's eyes began to glow. After ten minute of clumsily experimenting, the demon Rotbite fully regained control of the golem and began to rampage around Volkumburg, destroying [[Amelior's workshop]] in the process. Both armies, as well as everyone else in the village, stopped to gawk as this occurred. Lychor then used the distraction to cast a deadly spell on Valmous and those around him, putting him out of action for the rest of the battle, and then Lychor departed from the scene.

Amelior would gift the adventurers a number of items to aid them in the battle, including brass bottles containing his two loyal [[ogre]] servants and the [[djinn]] [[Hasan (djinn)|Hasan]], a brass bottle that unleashed a [[ballista]] with twenty bolts that was manned by four zombies, three [[Potion of growth|''potions of growth'']], three [[Potion of giant strength|''potions of giant strength'']], and a potion labeled "Drink Me If All Else Fails" that would transform the imbiber into a [[red dragon]]. Ultimately, the adventurers prevailed and the golem was destroyed after it fell upon the Crimson Wyrm and down through the cavern that was hidden beneath it.<ref>
