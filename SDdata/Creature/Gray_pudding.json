        "mainbody": "A '''gray pudding''' was a subterranean pudding that secreted extremely potent [[acid]].",
        "Description": "Out of all offshoots of [[black pudding]]s, gray puddings were potentially the most powerful. They appeared much like [[stone pudding]]s, having gray [[ooze]]-like bodies, and thus could disguise themselves against both rocky walls and surfaces, as well as in dimly lit areas.",
        "Combat": "These creatures, thanks to their ability to blend in with their environment, often surprised their prey.\n\nGray puddings relied on their potent acids to quickly corrode opponents, as well as their [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s. Unlike most varieties of ooze, which could dissolve either flesh, wood, or metal, gray puddings could dissolve all of these types, and at very quick rates. It took only six seconds for gray puddings to eat through almost all standard equipment and flesh. [[Plate mail]] took about twice as long to dissolve, and [[magic]]al items took longer, depending on the strength of their enchantment. In mere seconds, the average adventurer would be reduced to nothingness; not even the most dense bone in their body would be left behind.\n\nPuddings off this type were fairly weak against certain spells, such as ''[[flesh to stone]]'' and ''[[airy water]]'', which slowed and attempted to drown them, respectively.",
        "Ecology": "Gray puddings were solitary creatures, and had no need to rely on others or group tactics. Able to devour essentially anything, they could go after any type of prey.\n\nThese deadly puddings dwelt in the [[Wyllowwood]] layer of [[Undermountain]].",
        "History": "As with other puddings, gray puddings were thought to be derived from the more well-known black puddings. They were more common than stone puddings and [[dense pudding|dense puddings]]."
