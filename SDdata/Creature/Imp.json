        "Description": "Although imps could take the form of various animals, their natural forms were those of approximately {{SI|2|ft}} tall humanoids that weighed about 8 lb (3.6 kg). Their horns were small, sharp, and twisting, gleaming white along with their fangs.",
        "Personality": "The mind of an imp was both insidious and duplicitous, delighting in the corruption of mortals through trickery and temptation. Imps were masters of flattery, coercing others into acts of [[lawful evil]] through wheedling service due to lacking the intimidating presence held by other devils. When not outright trying to corrupt, they engaged in unscrupulous mischief, such as swiping valuables. Regardless of the fawning façade they upheld, imps were ultimately at the service of their infernal lords and viewed their worldly masters as tools.\n\nAt the same time, their obedience to their leaders in [[Nine Hells|Hell]] was rooted in craven pragmatism rather than genuine loyalty. Even though they were always at the service of another, whether a devil or mortal, imps were still independent creatures with ambition that belied their small size and sycophantic demeanor. Their true desire was like that of most devils, to advance beyond their current station and obtain a position of power, and offering them the chance to do so was the only way to obtain their true loyalty, if only temporarily. When provided with positions of power, their helpful personas faded away to reveal the authority abusing tyrants they kept hidden.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Nefarious_Imp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A particularly nefarious imp, spying upon others.'']]\nWhile within their natural forms, imps fought with their venomous tails, piercing the skin and injecting a potentially fatal toxin into their assailants. If needed, however, imps could polymorph into a variety of beast forms and individuals often had either one or two of them. Such forms were physically identical to normal animals and still allowed the imp to use their venom, although filtered through the animal's bite. Common animal forms for imps included that of a [[spider]], [[rat]], [[boar]], [[raven]] or [[goat]], although within raven and goat form they lacked the ability to use their venom. Whether in their natural forms or in the form of animals, imps retained their various magical abilities. They could turn [[invisibility|invisible]] and detect the presence of either magic or good at will. They also had the ability to use the [[suggestion]] spell once per day. Imps were strangely durable creatures, healing from injuries with supernatural speed, and resisting fire, cold, poison, magic and electric-based abilities. Only silver or enchanted weapons were effective against an imp.\n\nSo long as an imp served as a [[familiar]] its master obtained certain benefits through the imp sharing its power. A telepathic link was established between the two so long as they were only a mile apart, allowing the caster to share senses with the imp, including its [[infravision]], and empowering the master's spellcasting abilities. An imp closer to its master also granted them their regenerative abilities and resistance to magic. On the other hand, an imp separated from their master became weaker than normal, and the death of the imp could cause them to take a severe loss in ability. When serving as familiars imps were also given the power to request wisdom from the [[archdevil]]s, contacting them to ask six questions with a power similar to the [[commune]] spell. The bond between an imp familiar and its master was established through a contract and violating the services of the deal caused an imp to retract its service and all benefits thereof.",
        "Combat": "Although durable, imps were cowardly creatures that did battle only if necessary. When fighting, imps relied on the element of surprise, first turning invisible or entering animal form. From there, they waited for an opportunity to strike, such as the enemy becoming distracted, before striking and escaping from reach. Imps would immediately flee if a battle was no longer going in their favor, but the exception to this rule was when their mortal charges were in danger. This apparent loyalty, however, was mere illusion, as an imp was only concerned with keeping their ticket to promotion and connection to the mortal realm.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Devils were normally discouraged from worshiping deities by the powers of the Nine Hells. In addition to serving powerful devils or evil spellcasters, however, imps could be found in service to [[Deep Duerra]], the [[duergar]] goddess.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}"
        },
        "Ecology": "[[File:Imp Patagium.png|thumb|''An imp's patagium, for alchemical use.'']]\nImps would eat any form of meat, whether alive or dead. Although they did not require sleep, imps occasionally rested in the Material Plane in their animal forms to take a break from their constant duties. Imps had to earn their right to a gender, toiling for centuries before being assigned one based on their works.\n\nWhile other devils could be transformed into imps, they were also made from soul larvae twisted into form by powerful devils. They did not age naturally and if slain on another plane of existence reformed on their native planes after a year and a day had passed. Imps perpetuated the idea that their kind were the descendants of a variety of modern fiends.\n\nImps were the lawful equivalents of the [[quasit]]s, another diminutive race of fiends that coerced mortals into committing heinous acts for power. There existed a variety of specialized imps that served specific functions within Hell, such as medical care or translating.\n\nImp patagium was a valuable alchemical component. The wing membrane could be burned to produce ashes, that, when mixed with certain type of [[salt]] that quelled their fiery properties, formed a ''[[potion of invisibility]]''.",
