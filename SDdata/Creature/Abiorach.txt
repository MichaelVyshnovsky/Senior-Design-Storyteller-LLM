'''Abiorachs''' were a subspecies of [[rilmani]].

==Description==
Abiorachs had roughly the same physical characteristics of an adolescent [[human]]. Their skin glowed and their eyes looked like they were made from crystal, and often rainbow in color.

==Abilities==
Abiorachs had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[detect alignment]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[featherfall]]'', ''[[glitterdust]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[sanctuary]]'', ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[tongues]]'' [[spell]]s.

Depending on which plane they were on, abiorachs also had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[dig]]'', ''[[flaming sphere]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'' and ''[[lower water]]'' spells. When an abiorach was on an [[Elemental planes|Elemental plane]], they gained an immunity to the element of said plane, as well as an affinity with the residents of that specific plane. For example, if an abiorach found themselves on the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], they gained a total immunity to water-based effects and spells, and the friendship of the local [[water elemental]]s.

==Personality==
Abiorachs were more jovial and open-minded than most rilmani. However, they had a reputation of having an erratic, headstrong personality. 

==Combat==
When faced with a stronger opponent, abiorachs used cunning and guile over direct combat. Despite their lithe appearance, abiorachs were quite strong. Their weapons of choice were usually [[demilune]]s or [[trident]]s.

==Society==
Abiorachs were weaker compared to other rilmani. In rilmani society, abiorachs were used as agents, representing rilmani interests and keeping an eye on events in the [[Inner Planes|Inner]] and [[Outer Planes]].

===Habitats===
Abioraches and all other rilmani inhabited the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]], the divine realm of [[Oghma]].
