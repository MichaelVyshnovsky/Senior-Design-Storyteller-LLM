These magical beasts resembled musk-oxen.
The Axe of Mirabar, the militia of the city of Mirabar, rode rothé in the winter.
Many in the Realms were known to make strings for instruments from the dried intestines of rothé and their horns were hollowed out and turned into drinking implements.
Rothé back steaks were a staple of dwarven cuisine in the areas where the beasts were present.
