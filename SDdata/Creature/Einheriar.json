        "mainbody": "\"Einheriar\" (also spelled Einherjar) was a collective term for any army of the spirits of fallen humanoid warriors.\nThe term, which translated as \"faithful\",In the real world, the word einherjar means, \"army of one\". properly and most commonly referred to the noble warriors of Asgard, however, over time, it also came to be used for the formerly mortal armies of other planes, or the dwarven hosts of Clangeddin Silverbeard. Some of the powers of the Faer√ªnian pantheon had einheriar in their service, including Ilmater. In the Netherese pantheon, both Mystryl and Tyche were served by them. Eilistraee, goddess of the good drow, also had a host of einheriar. Einheriar loyal to Indra of the Lords of Creation were also known to serve the deity in the homonymous layer of Limbo.\nThe word was also used in the singular to refer to an individual member of the einheriar.In the real-world Norse myths, a member of the einherjar was called an einheri.\nEinheriar were described as wispy in form, including their armor and weapons. The majority of einheriar were once human, and they still looked similar in appearance to the persons they once were in life.\nEinheriar were suited in the highest quality of armor, usually with a design that hinted at the god or goddess whom they served. Rarely, their armor had minor magical enhancements.\nEinheriar were wholly obedient to the powers or proxies who commanded them, faithfully following their orders with great fervor.\nEinheriar were among the toughest examples of their former race. They were exceptionally fleet of foot. They also had minor resistance to magical spells, and most were immune to fear. Sometimes, the deity who commanded the einheriar would grant them additional powers.\nThe greatest among them were powerful enough to be considered quasi-deities. Such individuals were impossible to polymorph and were immune to mind-affecting maladies and magics that would drain their essence or abilities. They were strongly resistant to fire, to spells, and to physical attacks from all but the most powerful of magic weapons.\nEinheriar were immortal. If they were killed, they would simply return to life again after a short time to fight another day.\nDwarven einheriar from Mount Clangeddin in Arcadia frequently entered Acheron to battle in epic array against the evil forces there.\nThe einheriar of Asgard resided in Odins feasting hall of Valhalla, waiting for the great battle of Ragnarok.\nElven high mages had developed an epic spell to summon an army of einheriar to defend their homelands.\nWhen encountered on the planes, einheriar could be found in patrols numbering from 10 to 100 persons, marching in military units. These patrols usually included a majority of fighters, but other classes of warriors were among their numbers as well in smaller percentages. According to estimates as few as 10% and as many as 20% were divine spellcasters, while from only about 3% to as many as 15% were arcane casters. These were the roles that each warrior once held in life, and each recalled the full extent of his or her training and combat skills as a mortal.\nThere was no hierarchy among their ranks. All einheriar were equals, subservient to their commanding power or proxy.\nAs spiritual creatures, einheriar did not need to eat to survive.\nThey respected other celestial beings as aasimon and archons, but they worked independently of them. Einheriar received their instructions from the powers through prayer.\nAmong the Morndinsamman they acted as servants of the deities Berronar Truesilver, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, Moradin, Sharindlar, and Thard Harr. The goddess Lliira particularly favored as divine servants einheriar who were once partiers or pranksters in their mortal lives."
