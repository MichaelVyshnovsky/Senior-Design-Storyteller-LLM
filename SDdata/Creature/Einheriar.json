        "mainbody": "\"'''Einheriar'''\" (also spelled '''Einherjar''') was a collective term for any army of the spirits of fallen [[humanoid]] warriors.\n\nThe term, which translated as \"faithful\",In the real world, the word ''einherjar'' means, \"army of one\". properly and most commonly referred to the noble warriors of [[Asgard]], however, over time, it also came to be used for the formerly mortal armies of other [[planes]], or the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] hosts of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]]. Some of the powers of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]] had einheriar in their service, including [[Ilmater]]. In the [[Netherese pantheon]], both [[Mystryl]] and [[Tyche]] were served by them. [[Eilistraee]], goddess of the good [[drow]], also had a host of einheriar. Einheriar loyal to [[Indra (deity)|Indra]] of the [[Lords of Creation]] were also known to serve the deity in the [[Indra (layer)|homonymous]] layer of [[Limbo]].\n\nThe word was also used in the singular to refer to an individual member of the einheriar.In the real-world Norse myths, a member of the ''einherjar'' was called an ''einheri''.",
        "Description": "Einheriar were described as wispy in form, including their armor and weapons. The majority of einheriar were once [[human]], and they still looked similar in appearance to the persons they once were in life.\n\nEinheriar were suited in the highest quality of armor, usually with a design that hinted at the god or goddess whom they served. Rarely, their armor had minor magical enhancements.",
        "Personality": "Einheriar were wholly obedient to the powers or proxies who commanded them, faithfully following their orders with great fervor.",
        "Abilities": "Einheriar were among the toughest examples of their former race. They were exceptionally fleet of foot. They also had minor [[Magic resistance|resistance]] to magical [[spell]]s, and most were immune to fear. Sometimes, the deity who commanded the einheriar would grant them additional powers.\n\nThe greatest among them were powerful enough to be considered [[quasi-deities]]. Such individuals were impossible to [[polymorph]] and were immune to mind-affecting maladies and magics that would drain their essence or abilities. They were strongly resistant to [[fire]], to spells, and to physical attacks from all but the most powerful of magic weapons.\n\nEinheriar were immortal. If they were killed, they would simply return to life again after a short time to fight another day.",
        "History": "Dwarven einheriar from [[Mount Clangeddin]] in [[Arcadia]] frequently entered [[Acheron]] to battle in epic array against the evil forces there.\n\nThe einheriar of Asgard resided in Odin's feasting hall of [[Valhalla]], waiting for the great battle of Ragnarok.\n\n[[Elven high mage]]s had developed an [[Celestial army|epic spell]] to summon an army of einheriar to defend their homelands.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "As spiritual creatures, einheriar did not need to eat to survive.",
            "Relationships": "They respected other celestial beings as [[aasimon]] and [[Celestial archon|archons]], but they worked independently of them. Einheriar received their instructions from the powers through prayer.\n\nAmong the [[Morndinsamman]] they acted as servants of the deities [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], [[Gorm Gulthyn]], [[Haela Brightaxe]], [[Moradin]], [[Sharindlar]], and [[Thard Harr]]. The goddess [[Lliira]] particularly favored as divine servants einheriar who were once partiers or pranksters in their mortal lives."
