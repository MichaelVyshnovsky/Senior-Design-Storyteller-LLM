        "Description": {
            "Vortex": "[[File:Wizshade.png|thumb|''A wizshade and a female spellcaster.'']]\nA wizshade and its vortex consisted of mists similar to the [[phlogiston]]. The vortex was linked to the phlogiston beyond the [[crystal sphere]] of [[Realmspace]] by a tunnel a hair's-breadth wide. Those who were able could enter the vortex and traverse the tunnel to reach the phlogiston outside Realmspace.\n\nWizshades could step out of their vortex аnd move around on foot, by walking on the air, though this was rarely dоnе in order to avoid capture. The vortex could not move when the wizshade had left it. The wizshade could return to its vortex and leave as it willed. If the wizshade was destroyed, the vortex would collapse."

        "Personality": "Wizshades were whimsical, impulsive, chaotic creatures who enjoyed teasing others and flashy displays of magic. They didn't have any natural allies or enemies, but they loved to annoy powerful wizards and other spell- or [[psionic]]-using beings if they crossed paths.",
        "Abilities": "Wizshades employed their [[spell]]s to help or harm those they met. Wizshades could speak any language when they wished, typical [[Common]] or other commonly spoken tongues, but what they said didn't often make any sense.\n\nThey healed themselves by absorbing phlogiston.",
        "Combat": "Wizshades couldn't make any physical attacks, but they didn't suffer any damage from physical attacks either. They used wizard spells, and the only way to damage them was with magical attacks, such as spells and magical weapons.",
        "History": "In the centuries following the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], wizshades could be found in the ruined [[Six Tyryl Towers]].\n\nIn the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], there were increasing numbers of sightings of wizshades in the [[Underdark]].\n\nWizshades were known to [[Liriel Baenre]] during her time in [[Undermountain]] as of {{yearlink|1361}}; she fought one off together with the berserker [[Vasha]].",
        "Rumors and legends": "There were rumors that the most powerful wizshades had returned to life in other bodies on other [[planes]], or else regained their original physical forms and reappeared, unaged, on [[Toril]]. Some believed they were servants of the god [[Malyk]].\n\nThere were sorcerers who sought spells to control wizshades, not simply aiming to ward them off and using them as a weapon against one's enemies, but actually to command them as a personal army.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "They were found in the phlogiston more frequently than anywhere elsewhere.",
            "Relationships": "Wizshades were a [[favored monster]] of the deity [[Corellon]]."
