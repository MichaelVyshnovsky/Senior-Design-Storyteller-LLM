        "Description": "Much like the mundane lamprey, these creatures had round sphincter-like orifices that were ringed with sharp teeth. Their bodies measured around {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in length. They typically had a sickly brown, green, or grayish coloring.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures had horrible tempers. They were largely driven by a desire to eat and reproduce. They tended to aggressively fight other creatures in order to protect their lairs.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Biology": "Much like their smaller kin, giant lamprey had a near flawless homing sense, allowing them to pinpoint creatures up to {{SI|2|mile|long=yes}} away. They also were particularly vulnerable to [[fire]].\n\nThese creatures injected some form of [[poison]] into the creatures that they attached themselves. While this poison was harmless to creatures other than [[fish]], it imparted a severely sour taste upon the latter that many considered to be inedible."
        },
        "Combat": "Much like a leech or [[giant leech]], used their mouths to fasten themselves to prey, from which they gradually drained blood. Once full, they detached themselves from their prey, but otherwise they largely refused to let go unless killed.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Giant lampreys could be found in both fresh and saltwater environments, but were almost never encountered in shallow water, only deep waters. They typically made their lairs within underwater caves or coral formations.\n\nIn [[Faerun]], they were particularly known to the inhabit the lake [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]], the [[River Ashaba]] of [[Cormanthor]], [[Dragon Reach]], and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].{{Cite polyhedron/77/Downunder the Living City|12}} On the [[Moonshae Isles]], they could be found in various bodies of freshwater. In the [[Unapproachable East]], giant lamprey could be found in the lakes of [[Rashemen]].<ref>",
            "Relationships": "In salt water habitats, [[shark]]s often preyed upon giant lamprey."

        "Rumors & Legends": "* Local legends around [[Marsember]] persistently claimed that obscure sea cults dwelled in the city that fed living sacrifices to giant lamprey.<ref>"
