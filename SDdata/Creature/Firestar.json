        "Description": "[[File:Firestar-2e.png|thumb]]\nWhen active, a firestar was a fist-sized mote of light, ranging from as bright as a torch, all the way to total darkness if they so desired; they were often mistaken for [[will-o'-wisp]]s. The body of a firestar was a {{SI|2|inch|c|long=yes}} ovoid object, covered in a spiderlike web of glowing nerves; when they retracted their nerves to rest during the day, this object was sometimes mistaken for an ornamented egg of sorts.",
        "Personality": "A nocturnal creature, firestars would dance intricate patterns while exploring the landscape and ignoring nearby creatures or people. During the day, they would rest in elevated, unreachable areas and absorb sunlight and heat. They never initiated combat. Firestars were secretive about their own reproduction, and only conversed with creatures that employed ''[[telepathy]]'' or ''[[speak with monsters]]''. Drawn to light, firestars often investigated campfires during the night, and they sometimes sought these out to heal themselves. They traveled up to {{SI|2|miles|k|long=yes}} to investigate fire, and up to {{SI|200|yards|long=yes}} to investigate magic. Firestars could understand some words of [[Common]] and sometimes other local languages.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:FIRESTAR95.jpg|thumb]]\nThese illuminated beings could willfully control how much light emanated from their bodies, from pitch black to as bright as a lit [[torch]]. They would use their radiance to communicate, changing both their patterns and intensity of flashing.\n\nThey were immune to most magic, excluding magical detection, cold-based [[spell]]s, and ''[[magic missile]]''. They could also absorb energy from natural or [[magic]]al flames, and used this energy to heal themselves. If exposed to enough thermal energy the excess would bolster them instead; a firestar that absorbed enough heat could endure combat for about four times as long.",
        "Combat": "Firestars fought by unleashing a jolt of electricity, resembling a small ''[[lightning bolt]]''. This jolt could be shot up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} away and was conducted by metal.",
        "Society": "They generally ignored travelers. Moondancers had an intrincate language of their own, using a pattern of flashing lights accompanied by fluctuating luminosity and movements; they spent the evenings dancing with their peers.\n\nFirestars sometimes served the will of [[Brandobaris]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|167}} [[Corellon Larethian]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|101}}, [[Chauntea]], [[Hanali Celanil]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|115}} [[Lurue]], [[Marthammor Duin]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|75}} and [[Finder Wyvernspur]],{{cite book/Powers & Pantheons|15}} as well as [[Sel√ªne]] in her aspect of [[Bright Nydra]].{{Cite polyhedron/117/Forgotten Deities: Bright Nydra|16}}",
        "Ecology": "[[File:FIRESTAR-1991-HiRes.png|thumb]]\nFirestars were known to live in the [[Shalhoond]] forest on the southern [[Endless Wastes]], and along the [[Tethyamar Trail]] road in [[Daggerdale]].\n\nFirestars possessed organs that were valued in several aspects of [[arcane magic|arcane]] spellcasting, worth between one to five [[gold piece]]s. One organ was used as a [[material component]] in the spell ''[[dancing lights]]''. Other organs could be harvested for the production of magical [[ink]]s used in [[scroll]]s of ''[[control flames]]'', ''dancing lights'', and ''[[detect magic]]''.\n\nFirestars could be trapped as part of the creation of ''[[spell mirror (item)|spell mirror]]s''.{{Cite dragon/196/Three Wizards Too Many|92}}",
