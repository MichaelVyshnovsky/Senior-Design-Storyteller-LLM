Androsphinxes (|audio=androsphinx.ogg) were the males of the sphinx species. 
While they tended to be short-tempered and terse, androsphinxes possessed good-natured ideals and always attempted to do the right thing.
Androsphinxes were physically very powerful creatures and had terrifying, deafening roars that could be heard from miles away that could inspire fear in other creatures to such a point that they would become momentarily paralyzed. Those standing within  were liable to be deafened and even knocked over if small enough.
These creatures had innate magical abilities, with some being capable of casting clerical spells.
These creatures were typically capable of speaking both their own unique language and Common. Some were also known to speak Draconic
Many andros shunned the company of their female counterparts, gynosphinxes, as they resented their greater intellects and neutral-dispositions.
Androsphinxes were favored monsters of the elven deities Aerdrie Faenya and Solonor Thelandira, the dwarven god Vergadain, the Mulhorandi god Horus-Re, and the god Nobanion. They would sometimes send them as messengers to their followers.
