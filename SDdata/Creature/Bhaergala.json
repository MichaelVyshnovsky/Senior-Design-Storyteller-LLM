        "Description": "It resembled a combination of [[wolf]] and [[lion]]. Its fur had a unique smell, similar to freshly baked [[bread]].",
        "Combat": "The bhaergala favored ambushes. It would pounce upon its target, from downwind, and attack with their claws. It could drop from up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} without harming itself. It would use its teeth to tear chunks of flesh from its targets, and was known to toss them aside for later consumption. The bhaergala had limited magical resistance, and could turn a spell back at its target, but only four times in a 24-hour period. This ability was not innate and required focus from the bhaergala.\n\nA defense against the bhaergala was that it could be lulled to sleep with a song. This defense would fail if the creature felt threatened, was injured, attacked or was interrupted while hunting.",
