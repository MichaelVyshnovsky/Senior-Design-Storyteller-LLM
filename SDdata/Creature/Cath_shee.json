They associated only in spring for mating. If kittens were born, two cath shee would remain together through the summer, returning to solitary behavior the rest of the year.\nThe cath shee was slightly resistant to magic, and had the unique ability to teleport without error within .\nThey used their teleportation to great effect, ambushing prey in their hunts. They were given to pouncing, so as to bring into the fray all four legs against their targets. Their savagery was stunning when fighting for a mate, or for their kittens.\nElves from Evermeet believed that cath shee had been elves in past lives, sent forward as cats in order to atone for past misdeeds. Other elves believed the cats had been created by Corellon Larethian.\nCath shee preyed on other mammals, mostly rabbits and other rodents. Their natural teleportation made them difficult to corner and very capable of cornering foes.\nSome cath shee consented to becoming companions to green elves and silver elves. They were persuadable, but could change their mind several months later.\nSkinwalkers of Rillifane Rallathil could have cath shee as their totem animal. Priests of Nobanion could transform into cath shee by using Feline form.\nSeveral Seldarine gods were served by cath shee, such as Eilistraee, Corellon, Erevan Ilesere, Hanali Celanil and Rillifane Rallathil.\nCath shee used to be more abundant in the mainland, but had become less so as of , becoming common only in Evermeet, and the Farmeadows.\nThey could still be found in the Tannath Gap as of that time."
