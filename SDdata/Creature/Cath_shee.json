        "Description": "The feline was large, golden-eyed, greenish gray with a tufted tail and ears, reaching {{SI|400|pounds|long=yes|k}} and a height of {{SI|4|feet|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "Cath shee were clever and independent, ferocious ambush predators.\n\nThey were largely solitary and territorial predators, protecting an area of several square miles against any threats, or even others of their own kind. They associated only in spring for mating. If kittens were born, two cath shee would remain together through the summer, returning to solitary behavior the rest of the year.",
        "Abilities": "The cath shee was slightly resistant to magic, and had the unique ability to ''[[teleport without error]]'' within {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "They used their ''teleportation'' to great effect, ambushing prey in their hunts. They were given to pouncing, so as to bring into the fray all four legs against their targets. Their savagery was stunning when fighting for a mate, or for their kittens.",
        "Legends": "Elves from Evermeet believed that cath shee had been elves in past lives, sent forward as cats in order to atone for past misdeeds. Other elves believed the cats had been created by [[Corellon Larethian]].",
        "Ecology": "Cath shee preyed on other mammals, mostly [[rabbit]]s and other rodents. Their natural ''teleportation'' made them difficult to corner and very capable of cornering foes.",
        "Society and Religion": "Some cath shee consented to becoming companions to [[green elves]] and [[silver elves]]. They were persuadable, but could change their mind several months later.\n\n[[Skinwalker]]s of [[Rillifane Rallathil]] could have cath shee as their totem animal.{{cite book/Elves of Evermeet|109}}{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|124}} Priests of [[Nobanion]] could transform into cath shee by using [[Feline form]].\n\nSeveral [[Seldarine]] gods were served by cath shee, such as [[Eilistraee]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|14}} [[Corellon]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|101}} [[Erevan Ilesere]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|109}} [[Hanali Celanil]]{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|115}} and Rillifane Rallathil.{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|122}}",
        "History": "Cath shee used to be more abundant in the mainland, but had become less so as of {{yearlink|1367}}, becoming common only in [[Evermeet]],{{cite book/Elves of Evermeet|50}} and the [[Farmeadows]].{{cite book/Elves of Evermeet|61}}\n\nThey could still be found in the [[Tannath Gap]] as of that time.{{cite book/Spellbound/Campaign Guide|58-59}}"
