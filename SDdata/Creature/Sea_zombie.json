        "mainbody": "'''Sea zombies''', otherwise known as '''drowned ones''', were a variety of [[zombie]] who arose from the corpses of [[human]]s who drowned at sea.",
        "Description": "Being the corpses of drowned humans, sea zombies typically looked bloated and had discolored flesh that was dripping with foul water. Their eye-sockets were empty, they had blackened lips, and their tongue frequently protruded. Often their bodies might be encrusted with [[barnacle]]s and certain aquatic life, such as starfishes.\n\nThose who had been [[assassin]]s in life often wore a simple, makeshift mask of driftwood. A rare form of drowned one, known as a '''drowned master''', had shadowy tentacles in place of their legs and were always tethered to a powerful source of [[magic]]. They often acted as a leader of other drowned ones.",
        "Behavior": "Unlike the standard land-dwelling zombie, sea zombies possessed free will and could be rather cunning. They typically harbored hatred towards the living and it was one of the few things that motivated them.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Magic": "Being a form of undead, sea zombies were immune to ''[[sleep]]'', charm [[spell]]s, illusions, and other types of mind-altering spells. They also uniquely possessed a form of [[telepathy|telepathic link]] that bound them all allowing them to instantaneously communicate their thoughts and observations to other drowned ones within {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} of them.\n\nWhenever a [[priest]] reanimated as a sea zombie, they often would receive spells from evil deities.\n\nDrowned masters in particular possessed a number of unique abilities. An aura of intense cold radiated off their bodies in a {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} radius, their tentacles drained [[positive energy]] from other creatures and imparted [[negative energy]], and they could expel [[ink]] in a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} cone that was imbued with damaging negative energy. In addition, both their tentacles and ink could potentially infect their foes with the bluerot disease."
        },
        "Combat": "As many sea zombies were reanimated from the corpses of sailors, they typically wielded weapons common to that profession. Such as [[belaying pin]]s, [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[gaff|hooks]], and [[short sword]]s. Those who were [[rogue]]s or assassins in life could often be seen using daggers and [[crossbow]]s, stealthily skulking around, while those who were [[martial artist]]s in life were known to use their bare fists. Whatever weapon a drowned one wielded, it was always coated in bluerot.\n\nThey were often known to launch attacks upon anchored ships, climbing aboard the vessels and forcing their occupants overboard where they could be dealt with more easily.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Sea zombies had no need to eat flesh, though they often did so just to strike terror in others.",
            "Habitats": "[[File:Serosian Locathah necromancers.png|thumb|250px|''A group of sea zombies in the Sea of Fallen Stars are turned back by a [[locathah]] cleric.'']]\nSea zombies were almost always found in bodies of water, most often shallow bodies. They normally only strayed as far as {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}} from water. Drowned masters never traveled far from whatever powerful source of magic they were tethered to.\n\nIn the Sea of Fallen Stars they could be found in the [[Shipwreck Plains]], In its extension, the [[Alamber Sea]], many sea zombies could be found in the shipwrecks near the [[Alaor]] islands. Beneath the [[Sea of Swords]], they could be found around the temple [[Legacy of Deep Death]].<ref>\n\nOn the [[Faerûn]]ian mainland, there were many that inhabited the Rat Hills dump near Waterdeep.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], this type of undead was also known to occur on the planet of [[Oerth]] and in the [[Domains of Dread]], particularly in the domain of [[Draga Salt-Biter]].",
            "Languages": "Drowned ones understood the languages they had known in life, but were incapable of speaking them. Whenever they did speak, such as when a sea zombie priest recited the [[verbal component]] of a spell, it came out as unintelligible whispers."
        },
        "History": "[[File:Haarn Brightoak.png|thumb|''Haarn Brightoak battling drowned ones off the coast of [[Turmish]].'']]\nSome time in the early-14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[necromancer]] by the name of [[Delthrin Everet]] rose a legion of sea zombies and other aquatic types of undead to defend [[Marsember]] against a pirate raid.\n\nIn the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], the [[Rat Hills Conflagration]] drives many sea zombies out of the [[Rat Hills]] and into [[Waterdeep]].\n\nIn the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Marpenoth]], [[1369 DR]], [[Iakhovas]] lured the entire population of the [[Whamite Isles]] into the ocean with [[kelpie]]s, drowning and reanimating them into an army of sea zombies. These and many other aquatic undead later fought in the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] of 1369 DR.\n\nAlso in 1369, during the event known as [[Halaster's Higharvestide]], one hundred and thirty-six sea zombies arose from the sea bordering Waterdeep and walked across the [[Sea's Edge Beach]]. The then-[[Blackstaff]] of Waterdeep fought them off with a [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep|Walking Statue]] and many uses of the ''[[wall of fire]]'' [[spell]], eventually vanguishing them all within an hour.\n\nIn the [[Midwinter]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, as formed on the eastern shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars, a force of sea zombies and [[ghost]]s of pirates came ashore and attacked the city of [[Telflamm]]. They were ultimately driven back, due to the concerted efforts of the city's branch of the [[Church of Tempus]].<ref>\n\nIn [[1371 DR]], some of the remaining sea zombies on the Whamite Isles were summoned by the [[mohrg]] [[Borran Klosk]] to sack the city of [[Alaghôn]]. They were fended off by [[Haarn Brightoak]] and members of the [[Emerald Enclave]].\n\nSome time in the 1490s [[DR]],Although ''[[Locathah Rising]]'' is not precisely dated, it is set \"a few years\" after the events of ''[[Princes of the Apocalypse]]'' (p. 2). many drowned ones made up the army of [[Gar Shatterkeel]] and his [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rumors circulated claiming that sea zombies were animated by the will of a variety of evil deities. On Oerth, the most prevalent rumor tied them to that planet's native death deity, [[Nerull]].\n\n[[Sword Coast]] folklore spoke of sunken ships within the [[Mere of Dead Men]] that were swarming with sea zombies.{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, \"the Black Death\"|52}} One such ships was the [[Luskan]]ite long ship ''[[Seawyrm]]'', which sunk on it's way to the [[Mausoleum of the Ebondeath]]. The captain was a priest of [[Myrkul]], which drew the attention of the god to the ship when it sunk and turned the whole crew into sea zombies.{{Cite dungeon/73/Eye of Myrkul|33 f.}}"
