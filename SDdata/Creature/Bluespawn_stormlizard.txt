'''Bluespawn stormlizards''' were burly, horse-sized [[dragonspawn]] that sometimes acted as mounts for other spawn.

==Description==
Bluespawn stormlizards were large creatures that resembled bulky, wingless [[blue dragon]]s. They normally stood about {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder and weighed about {{SI|4000|lbs|k|long=yes}}. Older stormlizards had darker scales.

==Ecology==
Bluespawn stormlizards preferred to live in warm, dry regions. They naturally formed packs of four or eight, with an equal number of males and females in each group.

Bluespawn stormlizards were naturally immune to electricity, and could release electrical surges between them. They could also confer this immunity to other dragonspawn within {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} of them.

Bluespawn stormlizards reproduced on their own. Each stormlizard egg had two hatchlings in it, always producing same-sex twins. The twins would be inseparable from birth, and would grow listless and despondent if separated. If one twin died, the other would go on a mindless killing spree until it, too, died.

Bluespawn stormlizard pairs naturally sought out an opposite-sex pair for mating, but did not mate for life: within a pack, mates were known to change. The pairs used the same lair for their eggs, and twin fathers raised their sons together, and twin mothers raised their daughters together.

Bluespawn stormlizards recognized other dragonspawn as kindred creatures and refused to attack them. They could be domesticated if raised from the egg and trained as mounts, although the twins could not leave sight of each other.
