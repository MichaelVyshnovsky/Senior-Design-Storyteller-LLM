Jewelfish were tiny, silvery fish with iridescent scales found in the rivers and lakes of Faerûn.
Jewelfish were inedible by most humanoids.
It was once fashionable to dye jewelfish various metallic colors and keep them in garden ponds as decoration for the wealthy. The practice died out, but details of the process could be found in old books and guild archives in Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Memnon, and Esmeltaran.
