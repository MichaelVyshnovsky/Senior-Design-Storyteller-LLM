        "mainbody": "A leviathan was an elder elemental of water, a very rare variety of elementals that possessed immense proportions and apocalyptic power.\nThough these creatures had fluid forms on account of being composed entirely of water, leviathans generally took on the form of a serpentine shape.\nLeviathans exhibited a rudimentary, bestial intelligence.\nSometime prior to 1401 DR, members of the Cult of the Crushing Wave brought three leviathans onto Toril as part of some plot. On Tarsakh 17, 1401 DR, these leviathans attacked the galleon of the storm giants Hekaton and Uthor in the Trackless Sea as they were sailing back home to Maelstrom after a diplomatic meeting. During the battle with the leviathans, Hekaton channeled the power of the Wyrmskull Throne within his vessel and summoned a spectral blue dragon to turn the gargantuan elementals away. This day would be remembered and talked of by giant historians in the many years that followed.\nThese creatures were natively found in the Elemental Plane of Water.\nUnlike most elementals, for whom a wide variety of means of summoning them from their native plane were known, very few knew how to conjure a leviathan. The secret methods by which to do so were locked away within profane texts and inscriptions within ancient temples dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye.\nThese methods demanded exceptional skills in spellcasting to function, though even if a spellcaster were able to accomplish such a feat they were more than likely be killed by the conjured leviathan. Due to this risk and the threat that even one leviathan posed, the only spellcasters known to seek them out were the most unhinged and nihilistic cultists of the Elder Elemental Eye, in hopes that they may exhilirate the end of the world.\nsome cataclysmic end."
