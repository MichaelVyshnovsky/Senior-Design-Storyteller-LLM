On [[Tarsakh 17]], 1401 DR,{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|18}} these leviathans attacked the [[galleon]] of the [[storm giant]]s [[Hekaton]] and [[Uthor]] in the [[Trackless Sea]] as they were sailing back home to [[Maelstrom]] after a diplomatic meeting. During the battle with the leviathans, Hekaton channeled the power of the ''[[Wyrmskull Throne]]'' within his vessel and summoned a spectral [[blue dragon]] to turn the gargantuan elementals away.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|18-20}} This day would be remembered and talked of by [[giant]] historians in the many years that followed.",

The secret methods by which to do so were locked away within profane [[book|texts]] and inscriptions within ancient temples dedicated to the [[Elder Elemental Eye]].\n\nThese methods demanded exceptional skills in [[spellcaster|spellcasting]] to function, though even if a spellcaster were able to accomplish such a feat they were more than likely be killed by the conjured leviathan. Due to this risk and the threat that even one leviathan posed, the only spellcasters known to seek them out were the most unhinged and nihilistic cultists of the Elder Elemental Eye, in hopes that they may exhilirate the end of the world.\nsome cataclysmic end."
