Thus, it has been chosen as the name for this article. was an [[undead]] found beneath the [[Underdungeon]] of [[Stardeep]] by the [[Empyrean Knight]]s during a raid led by [[Telarian]].{{cite book/Stardeep|235-238|21}} It was later dispatched by his efforts combined with those of [[Kiril Duskmourn]].",
        "Description": "At rest, the relic lich was just another figure of bone-white like most of the other undead in its section of the [[Underdungeon]]. When active, the relic lich was sheathed in purple light which formed a crown, a staff, and a cloak.",
        "Abilities": "Disturbingly, the relic lich was capable of striking its victims down with a curse from its staff that left them in similar condition to the fossilized remains found throughout the city. It could also animate the fossilized remains in its vicinity and beyond.{{cite book/Stardeep|262-264|25}}",
        "Personality": "The relic lich sought souls to animate a mechanism to which it alluded, and it viewed the Empyrean Knights as adequate for that purpose. Per ''[[Nis]]'', it was fueled by \"splintered desires\".",
        "History": "Per the sword ''Nis'', the relic lich belonged to a murdered species. The Empyrean Knights approached its skeleton in {{yearlink|1375}} while sallying out of Stardeep through the Underdungeon looking to ask it for directions, but while it remained animate as expected, it had other plans for its newfound guests. It was finally destroyed when the Empyrean Knights were joined by [[Kiril Duskmourn]]."
