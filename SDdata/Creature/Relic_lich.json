        "mainbody": "The relic lichThe name of relic lich is only used once, but it is not known to refer to anything else so far. Thus, it has been chosen as the name for this article. was an undead found beneath the Underdungeon of Stardeep by the Empyrean Knights during a raid led by Telarian. It was later dispatched by his efforts combined with those of Kiril Duskmourn.\nAt rest, the relic lich was just another figure of bone-white like most of the other undead in its section of the Underdungeon. When active, the relic lich was sheathed in purple light which formed a crown, a staff, and a cloak.\nDisturbingly, the relic lich was capable of striking its victims down with a curse from its staff that left them in similar condition to the fossilized remains found throughout the city. It could also animate the fossilized remains in its vicinity and beyond.\nThe relic lich sought souls to animate a mechanism to which it alluded, and it viewed the Empyrean Knights as adequate for that purpose. Per Nis, it was fueled by \"splintered desires\".\nPer the sword Nis, the relic lich belonged to a murdered species. The Empyrean Knights approached its skeleton in  while sallying out of Stardeep through the Underdungeon looking to ask it for directions, but while it remained animate as expected, it had other plans for its newfound guests. It was finally destroyed when the Empyrean Knights were joined by Kiril Duskmourn."
