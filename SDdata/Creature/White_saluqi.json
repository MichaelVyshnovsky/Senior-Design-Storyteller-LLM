        "mainbody": "White saluqi were a rare breed of saluqi found only in the Mountains of Forgotten Dreams in the High Desert of west Zakhara.\nAs their name implied, this breed of saluqi had short white fur. This was a stark contrast to the darker black fur of the common saluqi. They usually stood shorter than a mans knee. They had stubby tails and sharp teeth.\nWhite saluqi were said to be as fast as gazelles and, despite their small size, as strong as a mule. Their endurance allowed them to chase rabbits until their prey dropped from exhaustion. White saluqis were fierce when they needed to be, often standing their ground against much larger animals.\nBecause of their unique appearance and hunting skills, white saluqi were prized by both sportsmen and collectors. They made loyal companions if cared for as a pet. A white saluqi could be purchased from a trader for 50 dinars in Tajar."
