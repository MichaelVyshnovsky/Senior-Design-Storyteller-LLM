        "mainbody": "'''Nycaloths''' ({{Pronounce|NY|kuh|loth|refs=}}), also known as '''nycadaemons''', '''nycademons''', and '''sky demons''', were the elite air cavalry in [[yugoloth]] armies, swooping down onto enemy flanks and tearing up unsuspecting troops.",
        "Description": "Nycaloths were large gargoylish creatures that were {{SIrange|8|9|ft}} feet in height and width, and weighed 800 pounds (362.8 kilograms). Their more traditionally fiendish appearance was made more fearsome by their thick, rippling muscles. They were hulking yugoloths with tough, leathery, light green skin and powerful bat wings but nonetheless moved with astonishing swiftness. Their heads were vaguely canine in shape, and it quickly darted from side to side like that of a bird, hosting a pair of horns and webbed ears.\n\nReports on the numbers of arms they possessed were variable with some claiming one pair and the others stating two. Regardless, all of their digits ended in weighty, sharp claws seemingly able to cut through flesh and armor with ease. Most were seen carrying large greataxes, clenched in their horned fists.\n\nThe females and males of the race were identical enough that other races couldn't distinguish them.",
        "Personality": "Nycaloths were cruel, calculating, and controlling, acting with caution to ensure maximum personal benefit regardless of who had to be hurt in order to achieve it. They constantly schemed in order to garner the favor of their superiors of whose status they envied, bullying lesser yugoloths in order to gain attention. They sought amusement by harassing those confined to the ground but when enraged could exterminate entire companies of [[mezzoloth]]s and [[dhergoloth]]s.\n\nTheir confidence in their physical power was potentially their greatest flaw, behaving smugly when in the presence of those they believed to lack power but hesitating against those of considerable strength. Despite their flaws they were among the most loyal and cooperative of the yugoloths. So long as an arrangement was mutually beneficial they would willingly work with any evil-aligned beings, and a master that treated them well would find them stalwart in the face of all but the most extreme bribes.",
        "Abilities": "Nycaloths were both powerful and fast yugoloths that soared through the sky even when carrying heavy loads. They had such a strong magical resistance that weaker magical items, outside of enchanted weapons, did not work when they used them. Their claws were incredibly sharp, causing wounds to bleed more profusely. They could see all parts of the radiation spectrum allowing them to sense invisible beings, and could telepathically communicate with any basically sentient being. Unlike many of their yugoloth kin, they could travel throughout the [[Abyss]] and [[Nine Hells]] as well as [[Gehenna]], [[Carceri]], and [[Hades]]. If needed they could summon in a small team of mezzoloths, dhergoloths or another nycaloth. Despite their brutish abilities they had access to [[invisibility]] and [[mirror image]] spells.",
        "Combat": "Nycaloths most commonly used weapons and were particularly fond of giant two-headed [[axe]]s 90% of which were enchanted. They were cunning enough to cleverly utilize what magical items they could wield to great effect and were immune to [[enchantment]] spells. They prided themselves on being able to suddenly strike without warning before teleporting, or using their other spells to confuse their opponents and disappear without warning. Their preferred tactic was to rush enemies under the guise of invisibility before savaging them with their claws. If the foe managed to survive then they would try to soar into the sky with the opponent in hand before dropping them from the air and hoping they'd die from the fall.",
        "Society": {
            "Ecology": "A pair of nycaloths would give birth to triplets, who would be allowed to grow for a hundred days before being forced to fight each other to the death with only the victor being allowed to live. They were suspected to once be scavengers despite their current predatory nature, as they seemingly enjoyed rotten meat."
        },
        "History": "In the year [[714 DR]], nycaloths were part of the [[Army of Darkness]] that led to the fall and ruination of the City of Song, [[Myth Drannor]]. As one of the deadly assaults, nycaloths unleashed a wall of living fire that incinerated remaining defenders of the city, including [[Anorrweyn Evensong]], who was defending the shrine of [[Mystra]] from the invaders. During the war, nycaloths destroyed one of the remaining ''[[gem of the weave|gems of the weave]]'', a magical [[ruby]], which weakened the city's ''[[mythal]]''.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], five hundred [[mezzoloth]]s and nycaloths were the elite [[Black Horn Regiment]] under the command of an [[ultroloth]] [[Inthracis]]. The Black Horn Regiment consisted of veterans of the unending [[Blood War]]. Inthracis' army was in service of [[Vhaeraun]] who used them during the [[War of the Spider Queen]] against [[Lolth]] and her [[Yor'thae]].\n\nSometime in the late 15th century [[DR]], a nycaloth had been imprisoned in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] on [[Chult]] by [[Acererak]] in order to guard one of the components of the [[Soulmonger]] machinery",
        "Notable Nycaloths": "*The nycaloths [[Aulmpiter]], [[Gaulguth]], and [[Malimshaer]] led the Army of Darkness against Myth Drannor in 714 DR.\n\n*[[Lashan Aumersair]]: once the ruler of [[Scardale]], in his afterlife he eventually was elevated to become a nycaloth by [[Shar]]."
