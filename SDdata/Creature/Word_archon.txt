'''Word archons''' were the [[celestial]] guardians of pure concepts, such as goodness, virtue, and love. These [[Celestial archon|archons]] excelled in the power of [[true name]]s.

==Description==
Word archons had bronze-colored skin and glowed faintly. Their most distinguishing feature was a pair of "wings" composed not of feathers but of pages of parchment [[paper]] suspended behind them. Each page bore a single rune.

Most word archons stood about {{SI|7|ft|c|long=yes}} tall and weighed between {{SIrange|150|200|lb|k|long=yes}}.

Word archons often carried a [[holy (weapon quality)|holy]] [[warhammer]] and wore magical [[breastplate]]s.

==Personality==
Word archons believed that the magic of true names was the purest form of language in the [[Cosmology|multiverse]]. They revered it and treated it as holy. Not surprisingly, word archons hated such creatures as [[logokron devil]]s and [[garbler]]s, beings who distorted the purity of [[Truespeech]]. They would attack such creatures without hesitation.

==Abilities==
Like most archons, word archons could fly well, despite not having what most would consider aerodynamic wings. They could also [[Teleport without error|teleport]] anywhere that they desired without a chance of failure.

Word archons were always [[Magic circle against evil|protected by a magical barrier against evil]] and were immune to paralyzation and electricity and resistant to [[poison]]s. They were further resistant to magic and could not be affected by mundane weapons or even low-powered magical ones.

Word archons could [[darkvision|see in darkness]] and dim light.

They were exceptionally intelligent. Word archons were known to speak utterances from all three lexicons.

==Combat==
Word archons generally began a battle with a potent utterance that sent a shock-wave against their enemies. After protecting themselves from ranged attacks, they would enter melee combat with their holy warhammers. When engaged in battle, they produced a menacing aura of righteousness that negatively affected their foes' ability to fight back.

If their enemies retreated, a word archon might target them from a distance with utterances of words that could cause physical harm.

==Society==
Word archons had a mission to defend the definitions of noble concepts from corruption, and, unlike most archons, word archons commonly left [[Celestia]] to fulfill their goals, seeking to use pure words to inspire goodness in creatures everywhere.

Besides Mount Celestia, many word archons lived in the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]].

It was unknown to scholars what position word archons held in the hierarchy of the Seven Heavens, but they were generally between [[warden archon]]s and [[sword archon]]s in power.
