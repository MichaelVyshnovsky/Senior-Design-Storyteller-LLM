'''Ogres''' were a race of [[giant-kin]].

==Description==
Ogres appeared as giant humanoids with very muscular bodies and large heads. They stood between 9 and 10 feet tall and could weigh 600 to 650 lbs.

==Personality==
Ogres were a lazy, brutish, avaricious race with notoriously quick tempers. Their avaricious nature would often lead them distrust one another and incite squabbling over treasure.

==Combat==
Ogres generally preferred to rely on ambushing their foes and overwhelming them through sheer numbers.

In terms of weapons, ogres were typically seen to use uprooted trees and stone-tipped javelins.

==Society==
Much like [[hill giant]]s, ogres were gluttonous creatures willing to eat almost anything. They enjoyed the taste of raw [[dwarf]] flesh, but would also eat halfling or elf flesh when they could get it. They would often use the skin and bones of their prey to fashion crude [[loincloth]]s and necklaces.

Ogres were known to typically associate with [[goblinoids]], [[orc]]s, and their fellow giant-kin [[troll]]s. In the social structure of the giants, the [[ordning (social structure)|Ordning]], ogres were considered the lowest-ranked of all giant-kin. Because of this, they were typically found to be willing servants of giants.

Many ogres worked as mercenaries, hoping for easy plunder, Lone [[hag]]s, as well as covens, were known to employ ogres as guards, while others ''[[polymorph]]ed'' ogres and sent them out to work as spies.
===Language===
Ogres spoke [[Giant language|Jogishk]], a patois of the Giant or [[Jotun]] tongue.{{Cite dragon annual/1999|29}}
===Religion===
Ogres typically worshiped [[Vaprak|Vaprak the Destroyer]] as their patron god. Though many also practically worshiped the true giants.

==Subraces==
;[[Half-ogre]]: Half-ogres were a crossbreed of ogre that was somewhat smarter and weaker than the standard ogre race. They could sometimes pass as unusually large, albeit ugly, [[humans]].
;[[Merrow (ogre)|Merrow]]: Merrows were ogres adapted to the water.
;[[Ice Spire ogre]]: An ogre subrace found in the Ice Spires region.
;[[Ogrillon]]: The result of ogre-[[orc]] crossbreeding.
;[[Zakharan ogre]]: Civilized ogres that were common in the southern continent of [[Zakhara]].

==History==
According to legend, the ogre race was formed when [[Othea]], wife of the [[titan]] [[Annam All-Father]], had an affair with [[Vaprak]].

[[File:Ogres ADD comic.jpg|thumb|left|Ogres overwhelm Priam Agrivar, Vajra Valmeyjar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright.|169x169px]]In [[1357 DR]], a small army of ogres served the monstrous extraplanar being [[Imgig Zu]]. He gathered them in the caverns beneath his tower to witness the Great Awakening of his people from ''[[Sel√ªne's Eye]]'', and to provide defense during the deed. The heroes [[Priam Agrivar]], [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], and [[Onyx the Invincible]] fought through the ogres to confront Imgig and free [[Cybriana]]. Though the ogres clubbed them down and caught them, the roof of the cavern miraculously tore open and the brilliant light of the full moon shone through, blinding the ogres long enough for Priam to slay Imgig. As the ritual was undone, the surviving ogres fled.{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon}}

==Notable Ogres==
* [[Bonegnasher]] took over the [[Tomb of Damara]] in search of the ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'' in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Guruk Bonesnap]] led a tribe of ogres after crushing the skull of its previous leader [[Kolgok Skullcrush]]. The tribe feuded with a neighboring gnoll pack led by [[Rattlefang]] in [[Wild Hills]], the vicinity of Daggerdale ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].<ref>
