Jaguars were large, jungle-dwelling felines.
Jaguars were similar in size and appearance to leopards, but were somewhat bulkier and had spotted rosettes. They had golden fur and black spots, but a rare few had black fur and black spots, and were called black jaguars.
Jaguars were ferocious predators, and greatly feared by any humanoid who lived in their territory. They were aggressive and attacked any creature they saw as a potential threat. They stealthily stalked prey, usually from above in the tree cover. Their sharp claws delivered devastating wounds. A jaguar was capable of jumping a distance of up to .
Jaguars lived solitary lives and were primarily tree-dwelling, spending most of their time above ground.
Jaguars were obligate carnivores. Despite spending a significant part of their day in the tree tops, jaguars were excellent swimmers. Being solitary creatures, jaguars only mingled with others of their species for mating. A female jaguar had a litter of up to three cubs.
Jaguars were typically found in jungles and were very territorial.
Beyond Faer√ªn, jaguars were found throughout Maztica
Jaguars had a significant place in Maztica, even having a month named after them in the Maztican calendar. They were the namesake of the Jaguar Knights of Maztica, and a holy symbol of the god of war, Zaltec.
Jaguar claws were a token of hishnashapers and used as a material component in certain hishna spells. Mazticans used tough strands extracted from jaguar guts to craft snares to capture parrots and other birds used for pluma magic.
Wild halfling villages in the jungles of Far Payit kept jaguars, using them to kill any prisoners.
