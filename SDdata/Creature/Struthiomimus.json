It resembled a large ostrich and had powerful legs. They had no teeth, instead eating with a sharp beak. \nA struthiomimus was comparably less aggressive than its distant cousin, the deinonychus.\nStruthiomimuses were excellent runners.\nStruthiomimus were most often encountered in areas with tall grass. \nStruthiomimuses were omnivorous and solitary creatures. While they rarely attacked large humans, they were known to attack demihumans and small humanoids. In the Realms, they could be found in the land of Chult."
