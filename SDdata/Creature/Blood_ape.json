        "mainbody": "lood apes were large primates found in the jungles covering the Guth Mountains on the Chultan Peninsula. Blood ape hides were prized as status symbols by wealthy hunters from Aztul.\nThe alpha male blood ape had silver fur and a bald head. Other blood apes had red fur covering their compact and muscular bodies.\nAlpha male blood apes had the ability to expand the size of their entire body and could also increase the size of other non-alpha blood apes in the vicinity. They could revert back to their normal size at will.\nWhen a threat was perceived, the alpha male of a hunting group composed of other males, would use his growth ability on himself and the other males. The males would pair up and attack specific targets without any display or forewarning. Blood apes would attempt to strike and grapple with any targets smaller than themselves.\nA blood apes sense of smell was incredibly strong, allowing them to catch intruders scent before they were spotted.\nBlood apes were peaceful foragers primarily active during the day. However, they were territorial and would fight to the death to protect their kind.\nA typical blood ape colony was mostly composed of infants and females, with a single dominant alpha male. The alpha male was the only blood ape allowed to mate with a colonys females, forcing other males to branch out on their own when they matured."
