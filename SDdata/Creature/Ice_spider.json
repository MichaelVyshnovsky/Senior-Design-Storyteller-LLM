        "mainbody": "An ice spider was a breed of giant spider that was suited to freezing-cold environments.\nGenerally, ice spiders had snow-white fur and red eyes. They wove webs just as regular giant spiders did, but the webs crystallized very quickly due to the freezing cold temperatures they were exposed to. Therefore, their cocoons appeared to be sheathed in ice.\nLike other giant spiders, ice spiders attacked with poisonous bites and restraining targets with their webs. Ice spiders, however, were resistant to all cold-based damage. Even the webs spun by these arachnids were slightly different to that of regular giant spiders. As such, the icy webs inflicted cold damage to any foe entangled by them, but the webs were able to be shattered by bludgeoning weapons.\nAS of the , the Fell Wood on the Spine of the World was inhabited by many dangerous creatures, including a frost spider infestation.\nIn 1374 DR, these giant spiders could be found in icy caves among the Sunset Mountains.\nIn the late 15 century DR, several ice spiders tunnelled under the Eye of the All-Father of the Spine of the World. The tunnel-dwelling spiders were led by a queen ice spider.\nIn northwest Faer√ªn, these creatures could be found around the Iceflow."
