'''Kezef''', called the '''Chaos Hound''' and the '''Ravager of Heavens''', and sometime referred to as '''Kesef''', was one of the three [[Elder evil#Elder Eternal Evils|Elder Eternal Evils]] of [[Faerûn]].

<!--and one of the [[Seven Lost Gods]],-->
==Description==
Kezef appeared as a huge mastiff that was little more than sinew and jet-black bone covered in ratty, maggot-riddled fur, with a rat-like tail and malevolent, unearthly red eyes. His footprints burned into the ground as he walked, and the yellow-green pus constantly oozing from his maggots pooled in such depressions.

==Personality==

==Abilities==

==Activities==
He was a unique being who roamed the [[Outer Planes]] constantly hunting the [[Faithful]], which were the souls of those who had chosen to venerate one god above all others. He had no taste for the [[Faithless]] or the [[False]], and was sickened by the taste of the spirits of the still-living. When Kezef destroyed one of the Faithful, the maggots that made up his pelt swarmed away from his jet-boned skeleton to devour the corpse. The gorged creatures then milled slowly over Kezef's body, making him appear bloated. Any of the Faithful who were eaten in this fashion were forever and truly destroyed, beyond even the recall of the gods.

Kezef relished the scent of hatred, and he sometimes paused and became substantial so that he could savor a particularly juicy emotional scent. In his wake, he left screaming nightmares particularly cherished by [[Dendar the Night Serpent]]. He was nauseated by the scent of cloying, reckless happiness.

==History==
Kezef was one of the primordial beings who appeared at the dawn of time, after the creation of [[Realmspace]], although a few sages believed he was instead a creation of the god [[Jergal]], who during a fit of madness created Kezef to deny the other gods the souls of their followers. Some believe that it was this event what eventually drove Jergal to step down from godhood as a penance.

Centuries ago, an alliance of [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian gods]] chased Kezef across the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]] to stop him from festering the souls of the Faithful, and when he was finally surrounded, the gods bet Kezef he could not break a [[leash]] forged by [[Gond the Wonderbringer]]. Kezef allowed Gond to place a short length of sturdy [[chain]] around his neck in exchange for [[Tyr]] placing his right hand in the Chaos Hound's slavering jaws. Gond anchored the chain miles deep in the floor of the Barrens' caves, and [[Mystra]] wrapped the beast in an unbreakable, glowing curtain of magical energy that automatically repaired itself. From these two traps, Kezef could not escape, and no one could reach him. When Kezef discovered he was truly fettered, he bit off Tyr's hand and feasted on its divine essence for centuries as he strove to free himself.{{Loss of Tyr's hand}} After imprisoning him, the gods forbade traffic by deity or mortal with the beast.

Kezef was eventually freed by [[Cyric]]'s machinations, to once again hunt the souls of mortals and gods alike.

Having been double-crossed by [[Mask]], the Chaos Hound spent every moment hunting down the elusive Lord of Shadows, chasing Mask across the planes. Mask eventually managed to successfully trap Kezef once more.<ref>

After the [[Second Sundering]], mortal [[warlock]]s began to seek out Kezef to make pacts with him in exchange of [[arcane magic|arcane powers]].
