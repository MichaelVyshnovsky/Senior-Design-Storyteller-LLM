A pair of massive, bat-like wings gave pit fiends a gargoylish appearance and they often wrapped their wings around their fearsome, red figures. Their huge fangs dripped with hissing, green venom and their prehensile tails could be cracked like whips.",

        "Abilities": "Every part of a pit fiend could be used as a weapon: their fearsome claws, their powerful wings, constricting tails, and menacing maws. The bite of a pit fiend was both venomous and infectious, inflicting a wicked disease known as [[devil chills]] and filling the victim with vile poisons. The combined effect drained the victim's vitality and strength, rendering them powerless against the brutality of the pit fiend.<ref name= \"WTAG\"/> As easily as they could envelop themselves in an aura of sheer terror, they could ignite their own bodies to burn anyone too close. Their scale armor and regenerative abilities made them incredibly durable, and good-aligned spells and weapons, or silvered weapons were the most effective means of stopping their natural healing.<ref name= \"WTAG\"/>\n\nThe magical abilities of the pit fiends were largely based around their ability to create and manipulate flames, often with truly devastating force.{{cite dragon/362/The Devil's in the Details|52}}",
        "Combat": "[[File:Blood war-4e.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A pit fiend fighting off a [[balor]].'']]\nPit fiends could surpass their already mountainous power by training, and those that chose to learn magic could be truly devastating forces of destruction. Not only did pit fiend [[mage]]s often specialize in [[evocation]] magic, but the only limit to their magical power and expertise was time, a particularly frightening notion given their immortality. But while their monstrous forms and array of magical abilities made them formidable foes, the greatest weapon in the arsenal of a pit fiend was potentially their minds. Through ingenious planning, fearsome guile, and creative tactics, pit fiends could win battles even without their power and magic.<ref name= \"WTAG\"/>\n\nPit fiends normally began battle by enveloping themselves in their auras and summoning other devils for assistance, often attempting to get them into flanking position. From there, they used their magical abilities to rain down hellish infernos upon enemy groups, striking fear into the hearts of their foes and magically restricting those without armor, especially in regards to irritating spellcasters. They viciously destroyed those they saw as most weakened by their initial onslaught. In addition to their claws, they were known to arm themselves with jagged-toothed clubs, [[Wikipedia:ankus|ancus]]-like weapons, and burning maces.\n\nTheir other strategies involved turning themselves invisible while savaging those most capable of perceiving them. If put in a dangerous position, they would maneuver the battlefield as needed and would not hesitate to sacrifice devils weaker than themselves. The only mental shortcoming of the pit fiends was their complete and utter hubris. Incapable of considering the possibility of failure, they often sought out the most powerful enemies first with dauntless intent to prove their indomitable greatness.",

        "Ecology": "Pit fiends were rarest on the upper levels with the exception of [[Avernus]], particularly avoided the colder layers of Hell and could be found in great quantities within [[Nessus]].\n\nPit fiends were made from worthy [[gelugon]]s or [[erinyes]] who were subjected to the devil-scorching [[hellfire]] from the Pit of Flame for 1,001 days.\n\nHowever, another way to create pit fiends was through the blood of Asmodeus himself as each drop would become a greater devil, most often a pit fiend. Such beings were imparted with fanatical loyalty towards their creator and pit fiends created this way could themselves spawn lesser devils, normally barbazus, by shedding blood. Through this bloodletting process, Asmodeus filled his layer of Hell with endless hordes of pit fiends.\n\nOnly the greatest pit fiends were promoted beyond the ranks of normal baatezu, the chosen few that were transformed by an archduke into a duke, a unique form of devil with its own special abilities.",
        "Notable Pit Fiends": "* The [[Dark Eight]] were a group of pit fiends responsible for managing various aspects of baatezu life, particularly conducting the [[Blood War]].\n* [[Abarax]] was a pit fiend that took on the form of Lord [[Orgauth]] of [[Zhentil Keep]].\n* [[Abbatorru]] was a pit fiend that enslaved the planeswalker wizard named [[Edalseye]] circa [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Koraboros]] was a pit fiend that had been bound by a warlock to a prison in the [[Sword Mountains]].\n* [[Tanetal]] was a rare baatezu that followed a [[deity]], specifically [[Bane]], and was forced by his god into serving the inept [[Red Wizard]] [[Marcus]].\n* [[Tenflames]] was a pit fiend which had a blood pact with the [[blackguard]] [[Krysus Vaant]], and was defeated by the [[planetar]] [[Resounding Justice]] ''circa'' [[1295 DR]]."
