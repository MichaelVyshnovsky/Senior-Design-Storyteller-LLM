        "mainbody": "Segarrans were humanoidâ€“animal hybrid servants of the savage goddess Ragarra that could be found in the jungles of east Zakhara. They were created through priestly spells and came in two distinct sub-species.\nWith humanoid body and the tail and head of a crocodile, lesser segarrans spread violence and fear in the name of their goddess.\nCreated from powerful priestesses of Ragarra, greater segarrans could appear either as humans, retaining much of their spellcasting ablities, or transform into a terrible and enormous reptilian creature, sometimes with bat wings.\nThe great bay adjacent to Zakharas greatest expanse of forest, the Jungle of Monsters, was called the Segara Sea (though not in Midani). It is unclear if the similarity of the name to the segarrans was accidental."
