        "mainbody": "'''Shadow dragons''' were [[evil]] [[dragon|true dragons]] that were either native to the [[Shadowfell]], or transformed by years spent there.",
        "Description": "Physically seeming insubstantial, shadow dragons had dark and translucent scales which helped them camouflage into the darkness around them. Shadow dragons were often mistaken for [[black dragon]]s, but their horns pointed backwards. A long fringe of spines emerged from the back of a dragon's neck and its powerful tail featured a swimming fin. An average shadow dragon was 20&nbsp;ft - 30&nbsp;ft (6.1 m - 9.1 m) in length.\n\nA dragon egg could be identified as that of a shadow dragon by the purple tinge seen when held in front of an intense white light, though it shared this trait with [[deep dragon]] and [[amethyst dragon]] eggs.<ref>",
        "Personality": "Shadow dragons were crafty and devious, and were on par with [[gold dragon]]s, the smartest of the metallic dragons.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Senses": "Like any other [[true dragon]], shadow dragons had sharp hearing and sight, which was capable of low-light vision and darkvision. They also had blindsense.",
            "Breath": "A shadow dragon's [[dragon breath|breath]] was a cone of shadows. Creatures caught in it lost parts of their vitality, skills and spells, possibly permanently, all while temporarily empowering the dragon. They could train their breath weapon to turn those they killed with it into [[spectral creatures]] who were then permanently enslaved by the shadow dragon.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}}",
            "Magic": "As they aged, shadow dragons learned an increasing number of magical abilities to hide from enemies and enhance their movement. They could hide away into shadows, even those  in otherwise well-lit areas, and learned over its ages to cast ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[dimension door]]''; ''[[nondetection]]'' and ''[[shadow walk]]''.\n\nOnce at great wyrm stage, they could fill a large area with darkness. Once this ability was used, a battle was in danger of becoming a one sided matter in favor of the shadow dragon. The darkness was impossible to disperse with light, magical or not. Creatures without ties to the [[Plane of Shadow]] were practically blind as long as they remained in the area that encompassed a radius of {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}}. Those with ties to the plane were largely unaffected. This ability was usable multiple times.\n\nLike many other true dragons, they developed sorcerer abilities with at least the potential to learn spells usually only open to divine casters as well as from the [[chaos domain|chaos]], [[evil domain|evil]] and [[trickery domain]]."
        },
        "Combat": "A shadow dragon would stalk its prey from the shadows, \n\nA shadow dragon had very strong spell resistances and very hard scales. As it grew, it gained an increasingly stronger resistance against spells and non magical physical attacks. Their scales were hard even among dragons and grew only harder with age. All shadow dragons owned an outright immunity against life sapping effects.",
        "History": "Around [[1372 DR]], a number of shadow dragons joined forces with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and there were a number of known shadow [[dracoliches]] associated with the cult.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Many shadow dragons inhabited the dark places of [[Faer√ªn]], such as ruins or abandoned keeps. \n\nThey were found in the [[Underdark]], particularly in the [[Middledark]] and [[Lowerdark]]. They preferred depths of at least {{SI|10|miles|long=yes}} below the surface where the connections to the [[Plane of Shadow]] were stronger.",
            "Relationships": "Shadow dragons were a [[favored monster]] of the [[drow]] god [[Vhaeraun]], serving him and sometimes being sent by him to aid his followers.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}} The same was true for the [[Chult]]an [[demigod]] [[Eshowdow]].<ref>\n\nShadow dragons were related to three drow offshots. A special form of [[half-dragon|half-shadow dragon]], ''[[zekyl]]'', [[Shadow creature (template)|shadow]] [[Draconic creature (template)|draconic]] drow, ''[[zar'ithra]]'', and the ''draa'zekyl'' or [[drow-dragon]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|2-4}}\n\n[[Sorcerer]]s were sometimes known to form dragonpacts with them. The pact was called '''Elusive Disciple of Dusk''' and gave the sorcerer abilities to flee safely."
