        "mainbody": "'''Giragonnes''' were magical hybrids of [[giraffe]]s and [[copper dragon]]s. These creatures were natural comedians, and were always looking for an audience.",
        "Description": "Giragonnes combined traits of their component creatures, featuring the long neck and spindly legs of a giraffe, and the draconic head and wings of a copper dragon. Although it stood {{SI|16|ft|long=yes}} tall, its torso was not much larger than that of a draft [[horse]].",
        "Combat": "Giragonnes rarely engaged in combat, preferring to defuse a situation or incapacitate assailants using their natural ability to cast ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]'', ''[[grease]]'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', and ''[[baleful transposition]]'', as well as their adhesive, thick spittle. If forced into a fight, giragonnes were able to deliver a powerful kick with their hind legs.",
        "Society": "Although giragonnes were sociable with other species, they generally didn't seek out the companionship of their kin.\n\nGiragonne lairs were filled with objects the creatures deemed comedic, including [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s filled with jokes.\n\nGiragonnes laired mostly in the Shaar and Aunorach, though they lived throughout desert and savannah areas.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Legend had it that these creatures were created by a humorous wizard with a passion for crossbreeding magical creatures."
