        "mainbody": "'''Vampyres''', sometimes referred to as '''fireghosts''', were a rare strain of [[vampire|vampirism]] found in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "Due to their unique abilities, a vampyre was liable to have ash-covered clothing or burnt hair.",
        "Abilities": "Vampyres were largely the same as the most common strain of vampirism, including having the abilities to ''[[shapechange]]'' into a large [[bat]], assume a [[gaseous form]] at will, [[spider climb|cling to and climb up walls]], and [[charm person|charm people]] with a gaze. They most noticeably differed from the common vampire in that their hands were always full of [[fire]], as if ''[[produce flame]]'' had been cast, though unlike the [[spell]] their possessions were liable to combust. This forced vampyres to utilize their bat form whenever they wanted to move or carry things without the threat of igniting them. Vampyres also differed in that they could transfer some of their life energy to other [[undead]] or living creatures by means of breath, usually in the form of a kiss, effectively healing or revitalizing them.\n\nOnly weaponry bearing a ''+1'' or greater [[enchantment]] could harm vampyres. In addition to the traditional vampiric immunities to [[poison]], ''[[charm]]'' spells, ''hold'' spells, and ''[[sleep]]'' spells, vampyres were impervious to harm from fire and took only half as much harm from cold- or electrical-based magic. Like the most common strain of vampirism, they could be harmed with [[holy water]] and [[holy symbol]]s.",
        "Combat": "When engaging prey, a vampyre usually sought to set their clothes alight and then attack as they scrambled to put out the flames, engage in healing, or protect precious combustible items.",
        "History": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1358}},<ref group=\"note\">This is derived from the date given in ''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'' for the death of [[Flaern Cragsmere]], mentioned in the ''Undermountain Adventures'' booklet in this boxed set. a [[Waterdhavian]] merchant-turned-vampyre by the name of [[Spadreera Omarkhont]] was lairing within the [[Sargauth Level]] of [[Undermountain]].",
        "Society": "A vampyre typically laired within structures made of stone that had been burnt bare."
