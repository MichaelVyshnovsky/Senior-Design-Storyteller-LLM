        "mainbody": "'''Swamp sharks''' were a species of [[shark]] that had been created by a [[Thunder Peaks]] cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] by magically modifying mundane sharks.",
        "Description": "These sharks had dirty gray skin with greenish-black markings that looked like patches of scum. Unlike natural sharks, their fins were specially adapted for crawling and they could survive short periods on land by breathing through a set of primitive lungs.",
        "Behavior": "These sharks relentlessly pursued their prey, all the way on to land if need be, until blocked by obstacles.",
        "History": "Around the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], members of the Cult of the Dragon came to the Thunder Peaks area. They went on to construct the [[Temple of the Dragon Oracle]] within the partially flooded crater of [[Mount Drakkor Rouge]], and then created the swamp sharks to act as guard animals for its brackish salt marsh waters.\n\nBy [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} two centuries after the Cult of the Dragon had abandoned their temple, swamp sharks could still be found within Mount Drakkor Rouge."
