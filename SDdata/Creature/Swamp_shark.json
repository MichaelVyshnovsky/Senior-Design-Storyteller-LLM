        "mainbody": "wamp sharks were a species of shark that had been created by a Thunder Peaks cell of the Cult of the Dragon by magically modifying mundane sharks.\nThese sharks had dirty gray skin with greenish-black markings that looked like patches of scum. Unlike natural sharks, their fins were specially adapted for crawling and they could survive short periods on land by breathing through a set of primitive lungs.\nThese sharks relentlessly pursued their prey, all the way on to land if need be, until blocked by obstacles.\nAround the 10 century DR, members of the Cult of the Dragon came to the Thunder Peaks area. They went on to construct the Temple of the Dragon Oracle within the partially flooded crater of Mount Drakkor Rouge, and then created the swamp sharks to act as guard animals for its brackish salt marsh waters.\nBy 1358 DR, two centuries after the Cult of the Dragon had abandoned their temple, swamp sharks could still be found within Mount Drakkor Rouge."
