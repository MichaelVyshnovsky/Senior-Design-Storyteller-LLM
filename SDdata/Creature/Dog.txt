==Description==
Dogs were a race of both wild and domesticated animals that were found all over the world. They came in a variety of breeds, sizes, and appearances. 

==Ecology==
They were extremely numerous and were domesticated for use amongst the [[humanoid]] races.

==Society==
Domesticated over thousands of years and bred for different purposes, dogs were adopted by many humanoids as pets and companions. They were very useful and commonplace but were often taken for granted because of this, but some valued them greatly, and they were considered to be loving and loyal and even a [[human]]'s best friend. 

Dogs were employed to pull sleds in [[Vaasa]] during the winter.<ref>

===Training===
Some of the best-trained dogs were trained by the [[elf|elven]] [[House Korianthil]].

==Breeds==
