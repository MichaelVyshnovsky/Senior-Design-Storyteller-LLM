        "Ecology": "The fish were dangerous flesh-eating creatures that often schooled under the floating raft villages of the [[Nubari]] [[Zantira]] tribe, waiting for food to be dropped into the lake. Locals believed that S'repic not only ate scavenged human food, but also disobedient Zantira children.\n\nS'repic were hunted by the Zantira [[spear]]fishers for their delicious meat and huge bright silver scales, used for decorations and accessories."
