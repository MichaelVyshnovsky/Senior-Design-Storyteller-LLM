A '''pyro snake''' was a large snake that attacked with fire breath. They were the fire equivalent of [[cryo snake]]s.

==Description==
Like other snakes, pyro snakes had animal-like intelligence. Their bodies were red-orange colored and appeared to be sheathed in flames.

==Combat==
These large snakes were completely immune to fire-based attacks. They attacked with their fiery breaths.

==Ecology==
These fire snakes lived inside volcanoes, or otherwise in scorching deserts. They formed small familial groups, and rarely interacted with [[human]]s. Like cryo snakes, they were known to lair in the palace of [[Gothmenes]].
