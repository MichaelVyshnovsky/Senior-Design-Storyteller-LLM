A pyro snake was a large snake that attacked with fire breath. They were the fire equivalent of cryo snakes.
Like other snakes, pyro snakes had animal-like intelligence. Their bodies were red-orange colored and appeared to be sheathed in flames.
These large snakes were completely immune to fire-based attacks. They attacked with their fiery breaths.
These fire snakes lived inside volcanoes, or otherwise in scorching deserts. They formed small familial groups, and rarely interacted with humans. Like cryo snakes, they were known to lair in the palace of Gothmenes.
