Most notably, as their names suggested, they had heads the size of a fist, as well as spiny bones in the rest of the body. The bone was likened to ivory in coloration and general appearance.This discrepancy in coloration may be explained by different species of knucklehead or changes in color during spawning season, just as real trout do.\n\n[[Scrimshaw]] art carved from the head bones of the knucklehead was a primary product of the [[Ten Towns]] of Icewind Dale. In fact, discovery of knucklehead bone and the art of scrimshaw led to the foundation of the Ten Towns, as it brought traders to the region. The trade made living in the cold northern land financially viable. and skilled scrimshanders were well-respected and influential."
