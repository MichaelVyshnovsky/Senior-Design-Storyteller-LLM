'''Panthers''' were black-furred jungle [[cat|wildcats]] similar to [[jaguar]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[mountain lion]]s.

==Description==
Like all cats in the leopard family, panthers typically weighed 120 pounds (55 kilograms) and were around four feet (120 centimeters) in length.

==Behavior==
Panthers were nighttime hunters, relying on their strong sense of smell and alert senses. They were expert climbers and had superb balance.

==Combat==
Panthers would pounce on their prey after stalking them and would hold tightly with their jaws while raking with their claws.

==Sub-Species==
[[File:Hunting Panthers (D&D).png|thumb|right|''A spectral panther (top) and fey panther (bottom).'']]
Panthers which were warped by the [[magic]]al energies of the [[Feywild]] and [[Shadowfell]] could become [[fey panther]]s and [[spectral panther]]s respectively. These species were capable of traveling between their respective plane and the [[material plane|material]].

==Reputation==
Panthers were a favored animal of the god [[Tempus]]. [[Solonor Thelandira]] favored great cats in general, as did [[Thard Harr]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|14}}

==Notable Panthers==
[[Guenhwyvar]] was an [[Astral Plane|astral]] panther summoned by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] via a ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]''. She was an unusually large and intelligent panther.<ref>

The noble [[House Matrell]] of [[Arrabar]] kept guard panthers in the gardens of the family mansion.
