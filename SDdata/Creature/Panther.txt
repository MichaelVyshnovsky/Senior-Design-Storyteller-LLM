Panthers were black-furred jungle wildcats similar to jaguars, leopards, and mountain lions.
Like all cats in the leopard family, panthers typically weighed 120 pounds (55 kilograms) and were around four feet (120 centimeters) in length.
Panthers were nighttime hunters, relying on their strong sense of smell and alert senses. They were expert climbers and had superb balance.
Panthers would pounce on their prey after stalking them and would hold tightly with their jaws while raking with their claws.
