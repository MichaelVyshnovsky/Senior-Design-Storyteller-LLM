They arose from the corpses of humanoid cannibals that died from eating rancid humanoid flesh.\nThe most distinguishing feature of a stench ghoul was the incredibly nauseating smell that constantly emanated from its body.\nBeyond using their stench tactically, this subtype fought in the typical ghoul manner of biting and slashing with claws.\nIn the late 15 century DR, a group of Daggerdalesmen adventurers traveling up the Tower of the Void were alerted of the presence of ghouls and a particularly potent stench surrounding them by the brigand Madder Belebrix. After fighting through a number of groups of ghouls and plaguechanged ghouls the adventurers came to find the debilitating smell was coming from a stinking ghoul that towered over them in size.\nThese ghouls were typically found in areas with rich amounts of carrion, such as battlefields and graveyards. Due to their great intelligence they were often found commanding packs of other ghouls. Beyond the Prime Material they could be found in the city of Evernight, the Shadowfells reflection of Neverwinter."
