This practice often involved a tool known as a [[beehive]], an artificial structure for bees to live in.\n\nSome notable places where beekeeping was practiced included the town of [[Eveningstar]], the city-state of [[Neverwinter]], and the plane of [[Dothion]],\n\nOther products of bees that other creatures harvested included [[beeswax]] and a resin mixture known as [[propolis]], which among other things could be used to make a varnish.\n\nThe [[spell]] ''[[shrieking walls]]'' required the wing of a bee as a [[material component]].
