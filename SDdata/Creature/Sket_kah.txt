A '''sket'kah''' was a specific type of [[serpent]] that dwelt in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]].

These serpents were venomous. Reputedly, their venom could be squeezed from them and combined with [[magic]]. When used, all one spoke was understood by all who could hear them.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], the [[lizardfolk]] [[Sleyvas]] claimed to use the venom of the sket'kah to communicate with and understand the three adventurers, [[Kromlech Bruenghor]], [[Vahn]], and [[Adrianna]]. However, as he later deceived the adventurers, it is possible that the things he told them were not true.
