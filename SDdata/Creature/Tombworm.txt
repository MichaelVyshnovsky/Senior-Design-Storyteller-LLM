'''Tombworms''' were a species of edible [[worm]]s found in the [[Dalelands]].

==Ecology==
Tombworms inhabited foundations of castles and were gathered for culinary purposes. A dish simply called [[worms in sauce]] was a bed of [[rice]] topped with seared green [[pepper]]-like vegetable and still-wriggling tombworms drowned in brown sauce. The worms had a taste akin to roasted [[almond]]s, "but better."
