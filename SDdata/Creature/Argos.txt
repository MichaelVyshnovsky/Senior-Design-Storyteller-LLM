'''Argos''' ({{SingPl|refs=}}) were amoeba-like creatures covered in eyes and mouths. They were found in [[wildspace]], around the same areas where [[beholder]] nations laid.

==Society==
On [[Toril]], argos could be found in the [[Moonlit Tower]] and the lowest levels of [[Undermountain]].

==Notable Argos==
An adventuring party carrying the ''[[Stone that Speaks]]'' was slain by an argos on the site of [[Tempus's Tears]].

An argos was brought to [[Spindleskull's Tomb]] by the [[Zhentarim]] wizard [[Baergil (wizard)|Baergil]]. The creature was kept there for the purpose of killing any fellow Zhent wizards transported to the tomb by its captor, using a specialized variant of a ''[[teleport]]'' spell.
