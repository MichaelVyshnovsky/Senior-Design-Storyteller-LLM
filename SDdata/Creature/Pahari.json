        "Description": "Pahari resembled [[mermaid]]s in their natural form, but they also appeared as small fish or beautiful women.\n\nA pahari’s scales ranged in color from blue and green to ruby red.",
        "Personality": "Pahari prided themselves on protecting the marine environment. They also opposed evil creatures at every opportunity.",
        "Abilities": "A kiss from a pahari granted the recipient the ability to breath underwater for a full day.\n\nAll pahari were strong spellcasters and had powers similar to [[Elemental mage|elemental]] [[wizard]]s who specialized in [[Sea (province)|water magic]]. Their favorite [[spell]]s included: ''[[airy water]]'', ''[[command water spirits]]'', ''[[conjure elemental]]'' (water), ''[[converse with sea creatures]]'', ''[[float]]'', ''[[sea sight]]'', ''[[ship of fools]]'', ''[[strengthen water creatures]]'', ''[[waterbane]]'', and ''[[water blast]]''.",
        "Combat": "Pahari were shy creatures who loathed combat. They were capable of using weapons, but rarely carried any. They were fond of using magical items to defend themselves.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Most of their diet consisted of kelp and seaweed that was supplemented with shellfish and mollusks. Pahari never ate fish, considering it to be cannibalistic behavior.",
            "Homelands": "Beyond the oceans of Zakhara, pahari could be found in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].",
            "Relationships": "Pahari communities were often accompanied by a small group of [[dolphin]]s. They considered [[sea hag]]s to be their nemeses.\n\nSome acted as servants of the [[marid]] Padishah [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].\n\nThese curious creatures were fascinated by surface-dwellers, bordering on being obsessed with them. They enjoyed collecting anything from the surface world. Sailors were welcomed into their communities to share their stories. Especially adventurous pahari would wander into surface villages completely naked to explore, dance, eat, and sometimes marry. Almost always they would outlive their husbands and eventually return to the sea."
