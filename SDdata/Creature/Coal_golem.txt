'''Coal golems''' were humanoid shaped constructs constructed out of [[coal]], as well as the elemental energies of [[earth (element)|earth]] and [[fire]].{{Cite web/Monster Mayhem/Coal Golem}}

==Description==
The cinders of rare woods and coals that composed their powerful bodies were always hot and burning, with two particularly large glowing cinders acting as the eyes, and were all held in place by an open [[iron]] frame. Because their coals were always in a state of burning a coal golem constantly emitted steam, it regularly shed bits of sparks or ash, and a hissing sound was made whenever it attacked.

Coal golems sported stocky legs and their arms extended down to their knees. They moved with slow, clumsy gaits. On average they stood {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed about {{SI|500|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
Whenever a coal golem engaged in combat there was a miniscule chance that the elemental spirit trapped inside it would break free of its constraints and go berserk, attacking the nearest living creature or, if no creature was near, smashing or setting alight nearby objects that were smaller than it. If nearby the golem's creator could attempt to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to it. Some sages speculated that this behavior was due to the conflicting mix of elemental earth and fire.

Attacking a coal golem was cold-based magic was liable to enrage them, regardless of whether they inflicted any harm or not, and draw their attention towards the caster.

==Abilities==
Like all [[golem]]s, a coal golem had innate immunity to most [[spell]]s, spell-like abilities, or other supernatural effects. Spells like ''[[cone of cold]]'' and ''[[ice storm]]'' could slow their movements, while ''[[Otiluke's freezing sphere]]'' could outright freeze them in place temporarily. Fire-based magical effects could break a coal golem free of these impediments and repair their body of damage.

==Combat==
A coal golem was typically armed with an oversized metal [[longspear]] that glowed red from the heat of the golem's body. A regular tactic of theirs was to ignite flammable objects in their surroundings, thereby making the area of combat more dangerous for their opponent.

==Ecology==
===Languages===
Like most golems these constructs could not speak, but unlike other golems they could not understand [[Common]]. Instead a coal golem could only understand commands given in [[Ignan]].
===Relationships===
Coal golems were most commonly created by creature with an affinity for fire and that thrived in intensely hot environments, such as [[fire giant]]s mastered in [[arcane magic]] and [[salamander]]s. The latter were most commonly known to create them and even believed by some to be the first to do so. Salamanders regularly used them to guard their forges or for mere slave labor, while fire giants sometimes created them solely to act as decorative mobile statues for their fortresses.
