        "mainbody": "ild dogs were a kind of dog that roamed throughout Faer√ªn.\nWild dogs did not usually approach humanoids unless they were starving or they had been provoked. If left to their own devices, they would avoid contact. It was possible to tame them, but they had to be separated from their pack first.\nThe Cormanthor wild dog was native to the forest of Cormanthor and behaved unlike other wild dogs. It was extremely aggressive and vengeful and would track its prey for as long as is necessary to make its kill. It was not averse to attacking medium-sized humanoids, and although omnivorous, preferred to eat mammal flesh.\nWild dogs generally shared the same habitats as wolves, widely encountered in plains, scrublands, broken ground, hills, and mountainous terrain.\nBesides Cormanthor, as well as in the hills of Cormyr, the Dalelands, and Sembia. \nIn the land of Kara-tur, they could be found in that regions tropical and subtropical deserts. In east Zakhara, wild dogs could be found in the Grey Jungle, the Furrowed Mountains, and in the Genies Garden.\n* The spell conjure animals could summon a wild dog to the aid of its caster."
