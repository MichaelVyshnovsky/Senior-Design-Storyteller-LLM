They were smaller and not as powerful as [[dragon]]s but were much easier to train, so they were commonly used as mounts.\n\nThey were often used as guards by dragons, or they were given to the dragons' humanoid servants.",

They were close in size to a large horse and were about as intelligent as one. Greater drakes could be trained as aerial steeds. Most species possessed a breathe weapon that originated from a bladder-like organ in the throat. They hatched from eggs and molted their skin several times as they grew to their full size. Greater drakes had an average lifespan of about fifty years.",

They originated when a group of powerful elven wizards helped Bahamut turn back a demonic invasion, and were meant to guard the elves against future invasions.\n* [[Crested felldrake]]\n* [[Horned felldrake]]\n* [[Spitting felldrake]]\n* [[Spiked felldrake]]",
