'''Brass dragons''' were a race of [[metallic dragon]].

==Description==
[[File:Brass dragon anatomy - Richard Sardinha.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''A review of brass dragon anatomy.'']]
Physically, the brass dragon was highly distinctive. From below, its outstretched wings formed a triangular shape, as they were attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings were longest at the shoulder, and tapered gently as they reached the tail. Their scales seemed to radiate heat and light. As their name implied, brass dragons tended to have brass-colored scales. Their scales were a dull brown at a young age, becoming more glossy and brass-like in appearance as they aged. The shape of the head was quite unusual, as it included a large, curved plate that extended from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and curved upwards into two points. They had two sharp horns on the chin, which became steadily pointier as the dragon aged. They smelled like metal.

==Personality==
Considered to be the most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons famously, or infamously, loved to talk and would engage friends and foes alike in hours of long-winded conversation. Although many experts thought that brass dragons were the humblest true dragons, their loquacity was in fact a manifestation of draconic hubris, though brass dragons would count humility as one of their great virtues. Brass dragons could not stand to let any intelligent being miss the benefit of their company and their great conversation skills because they thought themselves so great at it.

==Combat==
Brass dragons very rarely engaged in combat, preferring to talk rather than fight. If they considered a creature threatening, they would subdue it with their sleeping gas. In the face of true danger, a younger brass dragon would have most likely flown away and hidden in the sand. It would have fought and used its fire breath only as an absolute last resort.  Older brass dragons preferred to avoid combat but would fight if they had the tactical advantage

===Breath weapon===
Brass dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a narrow line of fire, and the second was a cone of sleep gas.

==Ecology==
Brass dragons hunted their prey while flying, mainly consuming [[antelope]], [[mountain goat]]s and [[sheep]]. Only evil brass dragons hunted intelligent creatures. Brass dragons have evolved for living in the desert and therefore can go long periods without water.

Brass dragon eggs were incubated in a nest of open flames. Incubation took approximately 480 days.

==History==
A stuffed young brass dragon was kept in the [[Obstacle Course]] level of [[Undermountain]].

==Society==
===Lairs===
Brass dragons were native to arid regions; they shared many similar habitats with blue dragons, which often led to conflict.  The brass dragon preferred to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also preferred to have the bulk of their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun would warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon's lair was well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders.

==Notable Brass Dragons==
* [[Argevar]], a lonely inhabitant of the vast desert of [[Mithardir]], the third layer of [[Arborea]] who disguised himself as a [[human]] to ambush travelers and add their possessions to his hoard of mostly worthless items.
* [[Ileuthra]]
