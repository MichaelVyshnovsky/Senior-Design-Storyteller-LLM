        "mainbody": "'''Condors''' were a rare species of large bird.",
        "Description": "Condors were large birds covered in large beautiful black feathers. Depending on the individual bird, their head was either bald like a [[vulture]]'s or covered in a layer of pinfeathers.",
        "Biology": "Condors were solitary creatures and spent most of their day in the air, landing only to eat, mate or sleep. Female condors laid up to two eggs per year and the young reached maturity within two years.",
        "Abilities": "Using their large wingspan, condors had the ability to remain airborne for extended periods of time, soaring on the warm updrafts from valleys.",
        "Varieties": "* '''Arctic Condor:''' a species of condor that had white feathers and inhabited cold, arctic regions such as the [[High Ice]]. Natives of that region often referred to them as \"great soarers.\"",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Condors typically made their nests along cliffs in mountainous terrain.",
            "Relationships": "Condors could be trained as retrievers or spotters. They could also be trained to carry items or even small [[humanoid]]s weighing up to {{SI|80|lb|k}}."
        },
        "Uses": "Condor feathers were sought after due to their large size and beauty. In the market, a pinion feather was worth up to 1 [[sp]] and a wing feather 1 [[cp]]. Condor eggs and young were even more valuable, fetching up to 60 [[gp]]. An intact condor corpse, with feathers still attached, was worth up to 10 [[gp]]."
