Bamboo spirit folk were the most commonly encountered of the spirit folk.
Bamboo spirit folk were nearly indistinguishable from humans. While they were normally more slender and lithe than most humans, it was their gold or yellow skin that was their main distinguishing feature. Their clothing was usually plain, often similar to that worn by many Kara-Turan peasants.
Despite being pacifists and preferring non-violent solutions, bamboo spirit folk were competent and skillful fighters. They were most often seen wielding parangs, short swords or wakizashi. They generally preferred light-weight armor such as leather or padded armor.
Bamboo spirit folk were strongly attuned to nature, and this proclivity manifested itself in their unique powers. They were adept at identifying both plant and animal species. They left no trail when traversing forest or prairie lands, and were able to hide among the shadows of trees. They were resistant to any spell or magical item which involved wood or the element of earth. They had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of speak with animals at will.
Bamboo spirit folk usually lived among humans, but occasionally some clans created their own settlements. All bamboo spirit folk were part of a clan. They almost always had friendly relations with humans, and were even sought out as marriage partners. Many bamboo spirit folk owned land and some were even active in local governments.
Bamboo spirit folk served the Lord of the Woods and were required to obey them. Disobedience, which brought dishonor onto the spirit lord, was punished by inflicting a natural disaster on the bamboo spirit folk and their family.
Bamboo spirit folk preferred to settle near wooded areas. 
The life-force of all bamboo spirit folk was connected to their bamboo grove, which was usually located deep within a forest or jungle. Any damage inflicted upon the grove was suffered by the individual bound to it. If ill or injured they returned to their grove, whereupon they were completely and instantaneously cured of any disease or wound. Their connection to their grove was not affected by distance, and thus bamboo spirit folk were free to travel as far away from their grove as they wished.
Though most chose a vegetarian diet, they were capable of eating anything a human might. They generally avoided alcoholic beverages such as distilled spirits or wine.
