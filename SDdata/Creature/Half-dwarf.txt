}}'''Half-dwarves''' (also known as '''halfbloods''') were hybrid [[humanoid]]s born through the union of a [[dwarf]] and another humanoid race.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 5}}

==Description==
Biologically, half-dwarves were almost indistinguishable from dwarves, except that half-dwarves were slightly taller. They were not considered a distinct race.

The physical and mental characteristics inherited by dwelves varied between individuals. This meant that some dwelves had more elvish characteristics and some had more dwarven characteristics.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title = Half-breeds| author = [[Steven E.

==Ecology==
Half-dwarves were usually the result of a dwarf mating with a [[human]], [[gnome]], [[elf]], or [[halfling]].

The fertility and offspring of half-dwarves was similar to that of [[half-elf|half-elves]]. If a half-dwarf mated with a pureblood dwarf, the offspring would be a pureblood dwarf. If a half-dwarf mated with another half-dwarf or a nondwarf, the offspring would be a half-dwarf.

===Culture===
Like half-elves, dwelves would adopt the cultures and [[Deity|gods]] of whoever raised them.

Non-dwarven mates who entered into dwarven culture were honored and respected by dwarves for their bravery and loyalty.

==Homelands==
Half-dwarf races were common in [[Ardeep]], [[Eaerlann]], and [[Myth Drannor]] at one point in history<ref group="note">Although the period of history is not made explicit, [[Eaerlann]] existed between {{Yearlink|-4700}} and [[882 DR]]. It's safe to assume that it was sometime within this period of history that half-dwarves were common. but by [[1358 DR]] were unheard of.

==Notable half-dwarves==
{{Main|:Category:Half-dwarves}}
*[[Isinghar Ironstar|Isinghar "Feyrune" Ironstar]] - a dwelf [[runecaster|runecarver]] and [[archmage]] from [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]]. Isinghar was one of five individuals who raised [[Myth Glaurach]]'s ''[[mythal]]''.
*[[Bryth Moonaxe]] - an inhabitant of [[Iltkazar]] and Lord Knight Commander of the [[Axe Brothers]]. He was released from a [[Phezult's sleep of ages]]'' spell in [[1370 DR]].
*[[Daeros Dragonspear]] - a famous adventurer. After retiring from adventuring in [[1255 DR]], Daeros built [[Dragonspear Castle]].
*[[Labrad]] - a dwelf gardener. Orphaned after his elven father and dwarven mother were killed, Labrad was among the first people to settle in [[Cormanthor]]. Labrad was buried at Greener's Glade in [[Dlabraddath]], [[Myth Drannor]].<ref group="note">The Campaign Guide in ''[[The Ruins of Myth Drannor]]'' mentions that [[Dlarbraddath]] was named after a dwelf gardener. Considering that the name ''Labrad'' can almost be found within the name ''Dlarbraddath'', it's likely that this passage is referring to Labrad and is not describing a different character.
*[[Anthan Narlgold]] - a half-human/half-dwarf heir to [[Clan Narlgold]]. Anthan is best known for slaying [[Gaulguth]] at the [[Lost Trench]] in [[713 DR]]. Anthan killed the [[nycaloth]] by impaling him with a spike of [[mithral]].
