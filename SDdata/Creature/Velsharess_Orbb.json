        "mainbody": "A Velsharess Orbb was a species of venomous spider from the Underdark. The poison it secreted was among the most dangerous poison in all of Toril.\nGenerally speaking, this spider resembled the black widow of the surface world.\nThese spiders were small enough that they could be concealed within a ring. Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre was known to wear a ring containing a Velsharess Orbb within."
