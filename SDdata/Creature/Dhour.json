The lights and shapes inside their bodies seemed dim and faint, almost as if the dhours were sleeping. We approached and studied them more closely, but they never acknowledged our presence, and I argued vehemently against attempting to goad them with spell or sword. So, we left and continued on our way.|[[Fayne Storoman]], Clueless priest of [[Faerun]]}}",
