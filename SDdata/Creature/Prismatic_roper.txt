'''Prismatic ropers''' were bizarre [[aberration]]s that loosely resembled true [[roper]]s.

==Description==
Prismatic ropers were said to resemble fleshy trees some {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}} tall, with four primary tentacles extending from the top. The mouth was located between the tentacles' bases. These creatures could change their skin color at will, allowing them to either near-perfectly camouflage their form or produce a mesmerizing, multicolored display. An adult prismatic roper weighed about {{SI|2200|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Behavior==
These creatures were only semi-intelligent and were primarily focused on hunting food. They had no inherent malevolence despite their bizarre nature.

==Abilities==
Prismatic ropers possessed both [[darkvision]] and [[tremorsense]]. They were adept at hiding, but when visible could change colors rapidly in a hypnotic display that fascinated any creature that could see it (blind creatures, naturally, were unaffected). They had only a single innate spell-like ability, the capability to replicate ''[[color spray]]'' thrice each day. Lastly, prismatic ropers secreted a paralyzing [[venom]] along their four tentacles.

==Combat==
Prismatic ropers were patient hunters that relied on their hypnotic display to draw prey to them, before using their venom to disable said prey and then constricting it with their tentacles. It used ''color spray'' on groups once they were within reach (which was as much as {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}). However, if a prismatic roper was approached by a larger or much more numerous group, then it would remain hidden unless a creature came too close.

==Ecology==
Native to deep underground areas, prismatic ropers often nested near well-traveled paths through the caves, making them hazards to many Underdark communities. They primarily preyed on small subterranean animals, but were not unwilling to attack humanoids if the opportunity presented itself. Slow when walking but lightning-quick with their tentacles, prismatic ropers were recorded to live alone, in pairs, or in nests of up to twelve individuals. They communicated with each other by rapidly changing color; they did not understand nor speak any language.

In [[Faer√ªn]], prismatic ropers were recorded to live in the [[Upperdark]] around the [[Deep Reach]].

==History==
Some sages thought that prismatic ropers had first been created to guard the [[Vault of Conjured Madness]] and had spread from there.
