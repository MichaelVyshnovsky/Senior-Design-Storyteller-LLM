        "mainbody": "Gorse were tiny faeries that lived in their namesake plant.\nGorse faeries were only  tall, similar in proportion and appearance to a human child, but possessing pointed ears and butterfly-like wings. They typically wore simple clothing that was green or yellow in color.\nGorse, like other fey, could naturally cast a few spells. Once a day, a gorse could cast exterminate, sprout, distract, and mirror image. One in ten gorse could also cast goodberry and spike growth once per day.\nGorse were shy and unobtrusive fey.\nGorse fought to protect themselves and their homes, using minute bows, spears, and swords. About 10% of their arrows were coated with a poison that caused mild confusion.\nGorse typically used the spell exterminate to deal with enemies that, while mere pests to larger creatures, were threats to the tiny faeries.\nThese faeries lived in tribes that laired in patches of gorse bushes these thorny plants made the lairs rather forbidding to larger creatures, as the thorns were dangerous and the branches dense enough to impede movement. Gorse bushes were evergreens that bloomed with yellow flowers, hence why the faeries dressed in those colors.\nGorse faeries would sometimes have magical potions in their tribes treasure trove. Due to their small size, some potions that would be only a single dose for a larger creature would be twenty doses for them. Others, however, that required drinking the entire potion for the effect would be untouched and possibly traded for a more useful one.\nGorse were a herbivorous species of fey.\nGorse had their own language, and were also able to speak the languages of sprites and pixies.\nGorse were wary of \"big folk\", but were protective of those who did them favors, such as druids or elves who defeated menacing beasts or fought wildfires. If such as ally was nearby, it was not unusual for a tribe to send a few members to accompany them for the duration of their visit. They could also be persuaded to deal with forest-dwellers that brought gifts of bread, fresh fruit, or milk.\nGorse were a favored monster of the Seldarine deities Aerdrie Faenya, Erevan Ilesere, and Hanali Celanil.\n* A gorse was one of the forms that a caster of the spell faerie form could assume."
