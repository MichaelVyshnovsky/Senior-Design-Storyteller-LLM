        "mainbody": "'''Gorse''' were tiny [[Fey|faeries]] that lived in their namesake plant.",
        "Description": "Gorse faeries were only {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} tall, similar in proportion and appearance to a human child, but possessing pointed ears and butterfly-like wings. They typically wore simple clothing that was green or yellow in color.",
        "Abilities": "Gorse, like other fey, could naturally cast a few spells. Once a day, a gorse could cast ''[[exterminate]]'', ''[[sprout]]'', ''[[distract]]'', and ''[[mirror image]]''. One in ten gorse could also cast ''[[goodberry]]'' and ''[[spike growth]]'' once per day.",
        "Personality": "Gorse were shy and unobtrusive fey.",
        "Combat": "Gorse fought to protect themselves and their homes, using minute bows, spears, and swords. About 10% of their arrows were coated with a [[poison]] that caused mild confusion.\n\nGorse typically used the spell ''exterminate'' to deal with enemies that, while mere pests to larger creatures, were threats to the tiny faeries.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Gorse were a herbivorous species of fey.",
            "Languages": "Gorse had their own language, and were also able to speak the languages of [[sprite]]s and [[pixie]]s.",
            "Relationships": "Gorse were wary of \"big folk\", but were protective of those who did them favors, such as [[druid]]s or [[elves]] who defeated menacing beasts or fought wildfires. If such as ally was nearby, it was not unusual for a tribe to send a few members to accompany them for the duration of their visit. They could also be persuaded to deal with forest-dwellers that brought gifts of bread, fresh fruit, or milk.\n\nGorse were a [[favored monster]] of the [[Seldarine]] [[deities]] [[Aerdrie Faenya]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], and [[Hanali Celanil]]."

        "Trivia": "* A gorse was one of the forms that a caster of the spell ''[[faerie form]]'' could assume."
