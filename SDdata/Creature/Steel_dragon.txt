'''Steel dragons''', sometimes known as '''Waterdeep dragons''', were [[metallic dragon]]s who were rarely seen in their natural form, instead living clandestine lives in [[human]] cities, observing art, culture, history, and politics.

==Description==
Steel dragons in their natural forms were especially feline in their movements and stature. They had scales that shone like burnished steel as adults and usually smelled like wet metal. Their wings consisted of overlapping blades that looked like feathers, and the scales on their chests resembled shields.

Their faces were particularly expressive, sometimes giving the illusion of a human-like face. They had many long spines surrounding their faces, which gave the appearance of hair.

In humanoid forms, steel dragons usually kept their true identities secret; however, they always had at least one visual indication of their true nature in the form of steel-gray hair, eyes, tattoos, or another feature.

===Abilities===
Steel dragons were immune to acid and resistant to poison and especially magic. They had innate abilities to enchant and charm individuals.

==Personality==
Steel dragons, as a rule, were amiable, curious, and witty. They would rather spend their time among human cultures than in their own true forms.

However, they had difficulty when dealing with all kinds of absolute authority, even authority that was used for good. This put steel dragons at odds with other kinds of metallic dragons that used their power and experience to justify their actions, specially [[bronze dragon]]s and [[gold dragon]]s; this also made them bitter enemies of [[chromatic dragon]]s. For those same reasons, steel dragons usually worked within their chosen communities to promote freedom and undermine authoritarian forces.

Steel dragons liked the company of humans, [[elves]], [[half-elves]] and [[dwarves]], and they usually supported [[adventurer]]s that opposed tyrants.

===Favored treasure===
They preferred to invest in property and business unlike other dragons, who preferred to hoard monetary treasures. Some steel dragons did hoard items, but they preferred to hoard works of art, antiquities, books, finery, [[magic item]]s or servants.

==Combat==
Similar to [[brass dragon]]s, most steel dragons would rather talk than fight, yet like all dragons, they could be formidable opponents. In combat, they avoided melee and instead relied on their magic. A steel dragon could cast the spells of [[cleric]]s as [[arcane magic]] and also could use the spells usually considered a part of the [[Knowledge domain|knowledge]] and [[trickery domain]]s. If truly losing a battle, a steel dragon was likely to [[teleport]] away.

A steel dragon could breathe both a line of acid and a cloud of poisonous gas.

==Society==
[[File:Greyhawk Dragon Spellfire.jpg|thumb|250 px|A greyhawk dragon with a long scarf.]]
Unlike most other dragons, steel dragons did not live in caves, preferring castles, towers, palaces, mansions, and the like.

While they preferred to eat in their human forms, doing so would not provide them enough nourishment to survive, so they would have to make excuses to go hunting secretly in their dragon forms every three [[tenday]]s or so.

According to [[Elminster]] steel dragons were also called "'''Greyhawk dragons'''", and according to [[Mordenkainen]], that was the proper name of the species.{{Cite dragon/243/Wyrms of the North: Jalanvaloss}}

==Notable Steel Dragons==
The city of [[Waterdeep]] was known to be home to at least three steel dragons:
* [[Auntyrlothtor]]
* [[Jalanvaloss]]
* [[Quituryte]]
Other known steel dragons were
* [[Stalagma]]
* [[Steelheart]]{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|54-71}}
* [[Velsaert|Velsaertirden]]
In addition, a female steel dragon named [[Razylymingeir]] lived in [[Darmshall]], and one named [[Zundaerazylym]] dwelt in [[Neverwinter]].

A consortium of [[Half-dragon|half-]]steel dragons called the [[Confluence]] was based out of Waterdeep.
