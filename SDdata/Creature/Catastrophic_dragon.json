        "mainbody": "Catastrophic dragons were a family of powerful and highly destructive draconic species.\nAll catastrophic dragons had the basic draconic form four legs, great wings, long necks and tails, etcetera. However, though living beings, they were composed of animated elemental matter.\n*Avalanche dragon\n*Blizzard dragon\n*Earthquake dragon\n*Tornado dragon\n*Typhoon dragon\n*Wildfire dragon\n*Volcanic dragon\nIn the legends surrounding the Dawn War, it was claimed that Io, creator and god of all dragons, was slain by a primordial. In the aftermath, most dragons chose to serve either Bahamut or Tiamat, but some lost faith in gods altogether and, believing that the primordials would win the war, turned to those powerful entities and offered them their service.\nSeven of the primordials accepted the service of these dragons, and transformed- or perhaps corrupted- them into catastrophic dragons. They sowed great destruction during the war, and survived the primordials downfall only to scatter across the planes."
