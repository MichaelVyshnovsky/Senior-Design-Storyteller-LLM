'''Eels''' were aquatic creatures.

==Species==
===Dreel===
'''Dreel eels''', sometimes known as '''trollfingers''' due to their appearance, were a species of river eel found in the [[River Reaching]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Their bodies were short, yet fat, and green-black in color. They subsisted upon algae and carrion, which kept the river's waters both clean and clear. They had a taste reminiscent of mucus, but could be quite nourishing, thus they were often fried with certain [[herb]]s or [[spices]] to mask their natural taste.

===Electric===
[[Electric eel]]s were a rarely-sighted species in [[Faerûn]] that possessed the unique ability to discharge a field of electricity.

===Kreel===
[[Kreel]]s were large eels domesticated by [[Athas|Athasian]] [[Lizardfolk|lizardmen]].

===Icewind===

'''Icewind eels''' were a species endemic to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. They were a commonly served dish within taverns across the coast of [[Icewind Dale]], often served battered and fried.

===Lamprey===
[[Lamprey]]s were a species of [[leech]]-like eels.

===Moral===
[[Moray eel]]s were large eels with a very dangerous bite.

===Mkunga===
[[File:Neverwinter-Eel Mkunga.png|thumb|200px|''The Mkunga'']]
'''Mkungas''' were a large species of eel endemic to the inland rivers of the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. They typically migrated downstream to the [[Trackless Sea]] to give birth in shallow, brackish inlets. Most would return upstream until they matured, though some would spend their whole lives within those estuary waters.

===Onsler===
'''Onsler eels''' were a species of freshwater eel that inhabited shallow streams and deep rivers throughout the [[Heartlands]]. They had pale skin, marked with dusty-white spots, and soft sucker mouths. They were sensitive to extreme temperatures and would die if water got either too cold or too hot. They were a rather passive and herbivorous species, subsisting on algae as well as aquatic mosses and [[lichen]]. They were capable of living longer than the average human; their bodies grew longer and broader as they aged, with young specimens being more cylindrical and older ones being more flatter. Their flesh had a pleasant texture, but was rather tasteless, thus they were typically doused in sauce or heavily seasoned.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/Ghelmer}}

===Splar===
[[Splar]]s were a species of eel with wing-like fins that allowed them to leap from out of the water.

===Suckertails===
[[Suckertails]] were a variety of eels from [[Laerakond]], highly appreciated by the people of [[Tarmalune]] due to their eating habits.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|47}}

===Vilhon===
'''Vilhon eels''' were a species endemic to the [[Vilhon Reach]]. They had long and ribbon-like bodies, black in color with green mottling. They often proved difficult to catch by fishermen using nets. They were a local delicacy in [[Nimpeth]].{{Cite web/More of the Vilhon Reach}}

===Wolf===
[[File:Neverwinter-Eel Wolf.png|thumb|250px|''The Wolf eel'']]
'''Wolf eels''', otherwise known as '''akoak''' by [[Ice Hunters]], were a rare species endemic to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Their bodies were blue and had large crushing jaws capable of eating sea barbs, woolly crabs and oysters. Ice Hunters that swam alongside them during exceptionally warm summers noted that they were generally non-threatening and curious creatures.

==Ecology==

==History==
