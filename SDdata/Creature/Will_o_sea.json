        "mainbody": "A '''Will o'sea''' was an oceanic creatures loosely related to [[will-o'-wisp]]s, unique to the [[Domains of Dread]].",
        "Description": "These creatures had insubstantial bodies, appearing as shifting cascades of glowing energy, in luxuriant shades and colors. On average they measured {{SIrange|12|20|ft|long=yes}}. They were at times almost indistinguishable from what people on some worlds would refer to as [[wikipedia:St. Elmo's fire|St. Elmo's fire]]. They were quite agile fliers, capable of suddenly switching between placid hovering and frantic jerky flight patterns.",
        "Personality": "A will o'sea was a highly intelligent creature and far more aggressive than its more common land-based counterparts.",
        "Abilities": "These creatures notably lacked a will-o'-wisp's ability to turn invisible, but possessed some level of shapeshifting ability, which they often used to take the form of a ship or lighthouse for the purposes of drawing in prey. Additionally, they were capable of shooting out bolts of electricity.\n\nThey could be harmed physically by weaponry, they were impervious to harm from most magic. The only forms of magic that appeared to harm them were cold-based, such as the [[spell]]s ''[[cone of cold]]'' and ''[[ice storm]]''.",
        "Combat": "The will o'sea preferred to hunt through deception and trickery, rather than direct attacks, shapeshifting itself over top of sharp rocks, underwater reefs, or other hazards in a ploy to draw prey towards it. Their most common ploys were to take the form of a burning ship, a tactic that particularly worked well for them during storms, or using their shimmering beneath the water to trick sailors into believing that there was sunken treasure below.\n\nThey would typically go out if their way to directly kill as few people as possible in the shipwrecks they caused, preferring to allow their victims to drown so that they may feast off their mental energies. They would often hover sailors, attempting to thwart any attempts they made to return to land. If any victims of shipwreck were escaping, a will o'sea would fire at them with its electrical attack, though would never unleash this whilst underwater.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "These creatures fed off of the electrical energy generated by the brains of [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s, particularly the emotional energy given off from those panicking from drowning.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"diet\" />",
            "Homelands": "Within the Domains of Dread the will o'sea made their homes along coast lines, typically near shipwrecks, and were commonly encountered just off of common sea routes. They could be in most climates, most commonly tropical areas, though were never found in arctic areas. One Domain of Dread they were particularly found in was the [[w:c:ravenloft:Sea of Sorrows|Sea of Sorrows]]. If a hunting area ever ceased to be viable, they would simply move on and find somewhere else to haunt for prey.",
            "Languages": "These creatures communicated in the [[Will-o'-wisp language|manner common amongst will-o'-wisps]], utilizing a variety of electrical snaps, color shifts, clicks and hums.",
            "Relationships": "The hunting grounds and lairs of will o'sea were commonly host to [[ghost]]s, [[sea zombie]]s, and even entire [[ghost ship]]s. These [[undead]] rarely interfered with will o'sea, though at times could keep sailors from entering their area."

        "Rumors & Legends": "Some seafarers in the Domains of Dread spoke rumors of there being undersea creatures that could communicate with them.",
        "History": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, as the [[Grand Conjunction]] was nearing in the Domains of Dread the boundaries between that [[plane of existence]] and the [[Prime Material plane]] were weakening, allowing for [[portal]]s to open sporadically between the two around [[the Vast]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|2}}  From one of these portals came a will o'sea, that appeared in [[Ravens Bluff]] around [[Tym's Supple Leather Shoppe]] and attacked a group of [[adventurer]]s. According to some accounts, these same adventurers might have fought more later that day, having been summoned by a [[sea spawn master]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|7-8}}"
