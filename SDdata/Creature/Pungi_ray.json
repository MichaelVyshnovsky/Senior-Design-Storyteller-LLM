        "Description": "On average, a pungi ray grew to be {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} and {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} across. They had sharp spines that were of a greenish or brown hue, making them resemble plant growth when concealed. Having a particularly resemblance to seaweed. These spines varied in length from {{SIrange|1|2|ft|long=yes}} and covered an area of {{SIrange|3|4|ft|long=yes}} on a pungi ray's body, with twelve spines altogether.",
        "Behavior": "Like other species of ray, this creature tended to hide its body beneath the silt and [[sand]] of the seafloor so they could surprise their prey. However, because of this, other creatures like [[human]]s were often at risk of stepping upon their spines. If they were ever truly attacked, pungi rays would try to flee from their attacker.",
        "Biology": "The spines on the backs of pungi rays were lined with [[poison]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Like all species of ray, pungi rays were carnivorous creatures. They primarily fed upon mollusks and crustaceans.",
            "Habitats": "Like most species of ray, pungi rays inhabited tropical shallow waters.\n\nIn the Realms, they were only known to be found in the land of [[Zakhara]]."
