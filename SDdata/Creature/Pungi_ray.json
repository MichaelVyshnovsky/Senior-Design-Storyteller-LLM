If they were ever truly attacked, pungi rays would try to flee from their attacker.\nThe spines on the backs of pungi rays were lined with poison.\nPungi rays lived largely solitary lives, though occasionally they could be found in pairs or groups of three.\nLike all species of ray, pungi rays were carnivorous creatures. They primarily fed upon mollusks and crustaceans.\nLike most species of ray, pungi rays inhabited tropical shallow waters.\nIn the Realms, they were only known to be found in the land of Zakhara."
