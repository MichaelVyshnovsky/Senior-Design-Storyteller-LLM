'''Oysters''' were a type of mollusk found throughout [[Toril]].

==Description==
Oysters were small mollusks with a soft body that was protected by a hard shell.

===Species===
[[File:Blacklip oyster.png|thumb|''Blacklip oyster.'']]
*[[Blacklip oyster]], a valuable species of oysters that produced [[black pearl]]s.
*[[Emerald oyster]]
*[[Giant oyster]]

==Uses==
Oysters were one of the few sources of [[pearl]]s. There were a number of colors that their pearls could come out as, but no one was certain as to what was the cause of certain colors occurring.<ref>{{Cite dragon/248/Crystal Confusion|48}}

Oysters could be smoked or consumed raw. Oysters were, obviously, a key ingredient in [[Beef and Oysters Barnabas]]. In [[Wa]], a type of cake, pink in color, was made with oyster shells mixed with [[cinnamon]].

An oyster shell could be used as the [[material component]] for casting the ''[[prismatic eye]]'' spell.

==Ecology==
Oysters were found in warm bodies of water.

==Locations==
* Oysters were found in the [[High Moor]]. These freshwater oysters very rarely produced pearls, but that did not stop [[human]]s from [[Secomber]] from taking the risk in hunting for pearls in the High Moor.
* Oysters were cultivated in the [[Lake of Steam]] although few produced pearls. However, a small town on the Lake of Steam, [[Yhep]], was famous for its scarlet pearls.
* [[Acoval's Cove]] was home to many pools in which pearl-laden oysters were cultivated.
* [[Moonever]] was a small village which supplied oysters to several settlements in [[Cormyr]].
* The [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]] was also known for its riches of oyster beds and their abundance of pearls.
* Pearling season in Zakhara lasted for five months and saw the waters between [[Gana]] and [[Jumlat]] teeming with pearl boats, their divers hunting for pearl laden oysters on the seabed.
* In [[Malatra]], the fishing village of [[Buyan]] cultivated oysters and sold what were considered the best pearls in Malatra.
* In [[Kozakura]], the fishermen of the island of [[Nakashima]] cultivated oysters for their pearls. The [[Senshi Islands]] were famous for its large and plentiful oyster beds.
* The waters off the coast of [[Iiso]], a city in Wa, were home to oyster beds which were the source of what many considered the best pearls found on Toril.
* Huge reefs of oysters could be found all along the [[Sword Coast]] and as far north as the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. These were vital for sustaining local fish populations, and so knowledgeable fishers avoided harvesting too many of them. The fish markets of [[Waterdeep]] sold oysters as food during the winter season.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-07-31 - Fish markets of Waterdeep}}

==Notable Users==
===Businesses===
* [[Felzoun's Folly]], a tavern in the city of [[Waterdeep]], served its patrons fresh whole oysters.<ref>
===Races & Sentient Creatures===
* In [[Kara-Tur]], oysters were part of the regular diet of both [[hai nu]] and [[tako]]s and were a delicacy among [[ningyo]].
