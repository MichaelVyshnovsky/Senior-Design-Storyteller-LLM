A celestial charger was a breed of celestial unicorn from the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia or the Grove of the Unicorns, the divine realm of Mielikki.
Celestial chargers were champions for the cause of good and powerful defenders of peaceful forests and those who inhabited them.
It was common for celestial chargers to become clerics, using divine magic to support their noble causes.
Besides the innate magical powers shared with common unicorns, celestial chargers were resistant to harm from acid, cold, electricity, and spells. The most powerful among them were also resilient against attacks from mundane weapons.
Like all celestial creatures, an attack from one against an evil foe could sometimes cause more increased harm than the same blow would inflict on a non-evil creature.
The tome archon Raziel rode a celestial charger into battle named Temperion.
