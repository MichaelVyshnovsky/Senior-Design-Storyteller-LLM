        "mainbody": "Gutterspites were a variation of raggamoffyn composed of a mass of pieces of rope, leather, and cloth holding together a central mass of glass gemstones, and glitter.\nAll raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victims face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyns bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creatures control.\nGutterspites were large enough to bond with dwarves and gnomes but not elves or humans. In fact, gutterpsites were the only variation of raggamoffyn that could capture gnomes and duergar.\nThey could create a blinding burst of light that affected all targets within a  radius. The blindness from this attack last for several minutes. Gutterspites were unaffected by the following spells color spray, darkness, light, rainbow, and continual light.\nThese creatures preferred to remain with the host they captured at their birth. The were unique among raggamoffyns in that they willingly cooperated with their host provided their goals were met."
