'''Blue abishai''' were the second-highest of the [[abishai]] [[devil]]s. Like their [[true dragon]] counterparts, the [[blue dragon]]s, they had a supernatural affinity to [[lightning]] and were highly intelligent. 

==Personality==
Blue abishai were the most well-learned of their kind, possessing vast, scholarly knowledge and devilish guile. They sought out lost lore, searched for ancient relics, and researched occult tomes and spellbooks from across the [[plane]]s. Their spellcasting was primarily used in aid of their queen [[Tiamat]].

==Abilities==
The barbed stinger on the end of a blue abishai's tail induced a powerful electric shock. Even without their magic, they were naturally armed with fangs and claws.

==Combat==
These abishai were prolific spellcasters, knowing several [[wizard]] spells that controlled the environment, manipulated minds, or purely destructive spells related to frost and electricity such as ''[[cone of cold]]'' or ''[[chain lightning]]''. While they could attempt to call in a small group of [[lemure]]s they could also try to summon other abishai, primarily of the blue or [[green abishai|green]] caste. When forced into close combat, a blue abishai could strike out with their [[quarterstaff]] or bite and claw at their enemies. As well as staves, such abishai were also known to wield [[trident]]s.
