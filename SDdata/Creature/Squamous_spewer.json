        "mainbody": "A '''squamous spewer''' was an [[aberration]] that dwelt underground. [[Sage|Sages]] supposed that, because of its appearance, it was perhaps related to the [[gibbering mouther]]. However, the spewer was considered much more deadly than the gibbering mother.",
        "Description": "The squamous spewer had a large amorphous body, covered in multicolored scales akin to [[Metallic dragon|metallic]] and [[chromatic dragon]]s, many mouths, fangs, and reptilian eyes. However, there was no typical kind of spewer.",
        "Abilities": "A squamous spewer could let loose a frightening roar from its many mouths. Many who heard it would find themselves panicking or at the least shaken. Squamous spewers had no obvious front or back parts, so they were not vulnerable to being surrounded. Because of their amorphous body, they were also not as risk of severe injuries. Their multicolored scales also gave them a natural camouflage.\n\nDespite their aberrant nature, squamous spewers shared traits with draconic creatures. They were immune to paralysis and non-voluntary [[sleep]] caused by magic.\n\nAlso like [[dragon]]s, a squamous spewer had draconic breath weapons. The type of breath weapon it produced in any given moment was random: it could launch [[acid]], [[cold]], [[electricity]], or [[fire]] (and it was fairly resistant to damage from these), and the breath would either be a cone or a line, resulting in eight different types of breath attacks. Moreover, because of its many mouths, it was capable of expelling its breath in at least three separate directions at once. However, despite its number of mouths and variety of breath weapons, a squamous spewer could only use one type of breath weapon at a given time. Because of their curious biology, some squamous spewers could have breath weapon varieties that differed from these standard types.\n\nTheir many eyes gave them good all-round vision and they possessed [[darkvision]], [[low-light vision]], and [[blindsense]] via scent and echolocation, essentially granting it nigh-omniscient knowledge of any creature's presence within their range.",
        "Combat": "A squamous spewer favored stealth, concealing itself until its foes came into range of its startling roar, to dispose of or scare away weaker targets. Then the creature used its breath weapons until targets closed within melee range, whereupon it would primarily attack with continuous bites from its many mouths.",
        "Society": "Squamous spewers were mercifully encountered alone. Despite their resemblance to dragons, and even speaking [[Draconic language|Draconic]], they had no loyalty to them, and they detested each other."
