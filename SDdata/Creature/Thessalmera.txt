Thessalmeras were one of the four known thessalmonsters, a species of crossbred hybrid creatures. A thessalmera was the result of crossbreeding a thessalhydra and a chimera.
Thessalmeras had a large, reptilian body with a long tail which ended in a pair of large, sharp pincers. Its head was that of a lion, surrounded by a ring of between six to eight hydra-like heads. A second head, that of a small red dragon, was found just below the ring of serpentine heads, on the upper back.
The dragon head was capable of breathing a cone of fire. The cone of fire covered an area up to  wide at the widest point, with a range of up to . Thessalmeras had a natrual resistance to fire and were immune to acid and any petrification effects and spells.
Each serpentine head of a thessalmera acted independently and injected a target with poison for every bite. Its lion and dragon head had powerful jaws, capable of crushing armor. It used its pincer to grasp a target and drag them closer to its many mouths. 
The primary head, controlling the thessalmera and containing its intelligence, was the lion head. If the lion head was fataly damaged, the dragon head acted as a backup head. If somehow both the lion and dragon heads were destroyed, the injured thessalmera became a semi-sentient and went into a berserk-like state, killing everything around it. It then retreated to its lair, remaining there until both the lion and dragon heads regrew.
Thessalmeras were a carnivorous species. It preyed upon the livestock of human settlements, as well as the residents. Its favorite meal was the meat from a freshly killed human.
Thessalmeras were typically found in jungles and swamps, often living near human settlements.
In Northwest Faerûn, some were known to dwell within the Mere of Dead Men. Beyond Faerûn, some were known to be found in the land of Chult.
Juvenile thessalmeras were sometimes used as guards. Thessalmera eggs were worth up to 8,000 gp and a live juvenile up to 12,000 gp.
