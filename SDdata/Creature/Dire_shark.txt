Dire sharks were a kind dire animal that were an unusually large and ferocious type of shark.
A dire shark had a toothy mouth set well under its long snout with a streamlined body and a triangular fin atop its back, and a crescent moon shaped tail. They were up to 25 feet (7.5 meters) long and could weigh more than 20,000 pounds (9,000 kilograms) thus being the second-largest type of shark to swim the oceans, only superseded by the megalodon.
Encountered as either solitary specimens or in schools of up to five members, they would attack anything they perceived as edible no matter how large it was.
A dire shark had a keen sense of smell that it used to hunt down prey in the great oceans. It would attempt to swallow whole anything of lesser size than itself, and would employ an aggressive hit-and-run tactic against its prey.
Dire sharks were native to the Fated Depths, a Fiendish Plane in the World Tree cosmology model."
In the late 14 century DR, a priest of Umberlee sent a fiendish dire shark to attack coastal towns in Luiren that refused to pay tithes to the evil goddess of the seas.
A dire shark ally could be summoned with the spells summon natures ally VIII and summon monster IX.
