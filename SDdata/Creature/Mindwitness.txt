'''Mindwitnesses''' were flying nightmares of eyes and tentacles created by [[mind flayers]] by inserting one of their [[Ceremorphosis|tadpoles]] into a [[beholder]].

==Description==
A mindwitness greatly resembled its beholder "parent"; an orb-shaped being {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, with a large central eye on its body, and ten smaller eyes on stalks emerging from the top. However, a mindwitness's mind flayer influence made an already horrifying creature arguably even more so; its fanged mouth was replaced with one more akin to that of a [[lamprey]], and this maw was surrounded by four large octopus-like tentacles.

A mindwitness's body was, like that of a beholder, naturally buoyant, allowing it to fly and granting it effects much like that of a ''[[feather fall]]'' [[spell]]. Its many eyes granted it 360 degree vision, preventing it from being flanked and making it generally very difficult to avoid being spotted by one. Mindwitnesses also had an innate resistance to spells and were able to project an ''[[antimagic field]]'' in a cone in front of them.

A mindwitness was able to communicate [[Telepathy|telepathically]] with any creature that had a language, and was itself able to speak both its own language and [[Common]].

==Combat==
In combat, a mindwitness behaved, unsurprisingly, much like a combination of mind flayer and beholder; using both the flight and eye rays of a beholder, and the illithid's fearsome psionic and brain extraction abilities.

A mindwitness would typically begin by unleashing a [[mind blast]] on its opponent, then follow up with eye rays from its ten stalked eyes. Like a normal beholder, each eye had a different power, namely: ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', ''[[flesh to stone]]'', ''[[inflict moderate wounds]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[slow]]'', and ''[[telekinesis]]''. In addition to the abilities granted it by its eyes, a mindwitness was also able to use the following [[psionic]] spells: ''charm monster'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', and ''[[suggestion]]''. If forced into melee combat, a mindwitness was able to resort to attacking physically with its tentacles.

After stunning or otherwise befuddling its target, a mindwitness would then attempt to attach all its tentacles to its opponent's head so as to extract its brain, instantly killing it (barring creatures with multiple heads, such as [[ettin]]s and [[hydra]]s).

==Society==
[[File:Mindwitness.jpg|thumb|''A gargantuan mindwitness and a lone adventurer.'']]
The main purpose of mindwitnesses within illithid colonies was to improve and accelerate telepathic communication, since mindwitnesses were capable of maintaining a telepathic link with up to seven other creatures simultaneously. As part of the [[ceremorphosis]] process, mindwitnesses were imprinted with absolute devotion and submission to commands, so if separated from its mind flayer masters, a mindwitness would seek out other creatures to serve. They were known to ally with [[flumph]]s and other telepathic beings such as [[demon]]s.

Normally dwelling underground, mindwitnesses could be encountered as solitary creatures, in pairs, or in groups as large as six.

==History==
[[Qrr'zarq]], a mind flayer who worked in [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], had plans to turn the [[Xanathar]] into a mindwitness.
