Albatrosses were a species of seafaring birds found around Faerûn.
The average albatross measured  in length and exhibited a wingspan of up to  in length.
These creatures were capable of seeing in areas of low-light and they were capable of flying without rest for incredible lengths of time.
Beyond creatures they were preying upon, albatrosses generally did not attack unless they were being threatened by a creature they could not easily escape from.
These birds were a carnivorous species, subsisting primarily upon fish and squids. They sometimes trailed behind ships in order to feed upon the refuse that was dumped overboard.
Albatrosses were typically found in areas near the sea that had a warm climate, but could also be found quite far away from land.
Albatrosses were a favored animal of Valkur, a Faerûnian deity of the ocean, and acted as his servants. Sometimes, Valkur would send albatrosses to appear before worshipers to indicate his favor.
Some sorcerers kept albatrosses as familiars, while some spirit shamans had them as a spirit guide.
