'''Albatrosses''' were a species of seafaring birds found around [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
The average albatross measured {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} in length and exhibited a wingspan of up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Abilities==
These creatures were capable of seeing in areas of [[low-light vision|low-light]] and they were capable of flying without rest for incredible lengths of time.

==Combat==
Beyond creatures they were preying upon, albatrosses generally did not attack unless they were being threatened by a creature they could not easily escape from.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
These birds were a carnivorous species, subsisting primarily upon [[fish]] and [[squid]]s. They sometimes trailed behind ships in order to feed upon the refuse that was dumped overboard.
===Habitat===
Albatrosses were typically found in areas near the sea that had a warm climate, but could also be found quite far away from land.
===Relationships===
Albatrosses were a [[favored animal]] of [[Valkur]], a [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[deity]] of the ocean, and acted as his servants. Sometimes, Valkur would send albatrosses to appear before worshipers to indicate his favor.

Some [[sorcerer]]s kept albatrosses as [[familiar]]s, while some [[spirit shaman]]s had them as a [[spirit guide]].<ref>

==Trivia==
* The [[Beached Leviathan]], an inn and tavern in the city of [[Neverwinter]], used "albatross" as a slang term to refer to someone that was bringing bad luck to the establishment.{{Cite dungeon/193/Tavern Profile:The Beached Leviathan|59}}
* These birds were the namesake for the [[Hooked Albatross Inn]] of [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref>
