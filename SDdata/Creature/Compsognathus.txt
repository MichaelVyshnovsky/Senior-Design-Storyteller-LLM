'''Compsognathus''' ({{Pronounce|kamp|sag|NA|thus|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}), also referred to as '''compy''', or as a '''garuda chicken''' by the inhabitants of the [[Malatran Plateau]],

==Description==
Among dinosaurs, compsognathus were very small, being roughly the same size as a [[chicken]].

==Combat==
Compsognathus hunted prey in packs. They attacked as an ambush and preferred to attack prey while it was sleeping.

==Ecology==
Compsognathus were carnivores and lived in packs. Their typical diet consisted of [[lizard]]s and [[insect]]s.

===Habitats===
Compsognathus lived along the [[River Soshenstar]], and although they didn't pose a threat, their harassment of the citizens of [[Port Nyanzaru]] led to the development of a barbed metal [[wire]] known as [[compy wire]].

==Uses==
Compsognathus were valued as [[familiar]]s for their highly developed sight, and they could be summoned using a ''[[find familiar]]'' spell.{{Cite dragon/200/Familiar Faces|31-32}}
