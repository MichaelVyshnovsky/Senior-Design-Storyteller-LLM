Compsognathus (), also referred to as compy, or as a garuda chicken by the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau,
Among dinosaurs, compsognathus were very small, being roughly the same size as a chicken.
Compsognathus hunted prey in packs. They attacked as an ambush and preferred to attack prey while it was sleeping.
Compsognathus were carnivores and lived in packs. Their typical diet consisted of lizards and insects.
Compsognathus lived along the River Soshenstar, and although they didnt pose a threat, their harassment of the citizens of Port Nyanzaru led to the development of a barbed metal wire known as compy wire.
Compsognathus were valued as familiars for their highly developed sight, and they could be summoned using a find familiar spell.
