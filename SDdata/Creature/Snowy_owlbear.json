        "mainbody": "Snowy owlbears, also known as arctic owlbears and polar owlbears, were a kind of owlbear native to arctic regions. Similarly to their cousins from more temperate climes, they looked like hybrids of snowy owls and polar bears.\nMuch like regular owlbears, these were monstrous beasts with the bodies of bears covered in thick shaggy coats of both fur and feathers, both of a snowy white hue. Their heads were rounded and avian, like those of owls, with large round forward-facing eyes that glowed yellow. Both their beaks and claws were black. A fully grown specimen stood  high.\nLittle more intelligent than most animals, They hunted so heavily because of their insatiable appetites, more than that of a giant owl and a bear combined. A hungry owlbear feared nothing, not even superior strength and size, and was not discouraged by any obstacle or impediment, and with little instinct for self-preservation, it would fight to the death. The people of polar regions swore that were nothing worse than having an arctic owlbear hunting on ones trail.\nUnlike their cousins, snowy owlbears were primarily diurnal and thus hunted largely during the day,\nOwlbears communicated via hooting and screeching, at high volume and with a range of pitches and durations.\nArctic owlbears were entirely carnivorous. While they would prey on any kind of creature, they favored seal most of all, and as they were capable swimmers, they would pursue their prey even into the freezing cold water. Otherwise, they would take foxes, hares, walruses, mules, axe beaks, and humanoids.\nA snowy owlbear naturally had a bears keen sense of scent as well as an owls sharp eyesight for finding prey in the dark, with specimens even reported to possess darkvision.\nThe multiple layers of fur and feathers in an arctic owlbears coat protected it from the cold, even when wet. Moreover, it was immune to magical cold and other frigid effects, though not to other kinds of magic. They were little bothered by blizzards or extremes of cold. Moreover, their pure-white coloration meant they had good camouflage in arctic environments, greatly aiding them in ambushes.\nFurthermore, an arctic owlbears paws had rough leathery pads, which helped it remain stable on slippery ice. They were also swift and capable swimmers.\nSnowy owlbears fought much like standard owlbears, using both their beaks and their claws. They would try to slash and grab prey with one or both their claws, crush it in a bear-hug, and bite it and rend it in twain. While in a bear-hug, an owlbear often could not use its claws, and so favored biting with its beak and using its brute strength to crush its victim. In addition, their superior ability to blend into their environment, thanks to their white fur and feathers, made them more successful at ambushing prey. Even at the point of death, an owlbear would fight as vigorously as it would when healthy.\nSnowy owlbears inhabited the most frigid regions of the arctic and generally laired in natural caves or dens dug out of snowbanks where they slept or hibernated. Yet they did not stay in these for any great length of time, as they were always wandering across the ice in search of new prey.\nAdult owlbears dwelled together as mated pairs. Their clutches consisted of up to six eggs, and both parents cared for their young well past infancy. The young remained in their lairs while they went hunting. Despite this, owlbear chicks were still relatively dangerous. They lived up to 20 years.\nWhen out hunting, as they always were, owlbears could be encountered alone, in mated pairs, or in packs of up to eight.\nThese creatures lived in the wilds of Icewind Dale and the Frozenfar.\nSnowy owlbear feathers were used in dreamcatchers and other artworks crafted in Icewind Dale.\nThe Reghedmen inhabitants of the Cave of the Berserkers hunted snowy owlbears by luring them into their cave and killing them. They then butchered them for meat.\nA tamed snowy owlbear required about three pigs worth of food, usually costing 6 gp, to keep it fed and content.\nEven in the midâ€“14 century DR, arctic owlbears were still only a subject of rumor and speculation. No specimens had ever been caught to verify their existence.\nHowever, they were evidently familiar to the Reghedmen of Icewind Dale by the late 15 century DR.\n* Featherfirn, a particularly massive snowy owlbear that dwelt in Dragonscar Gorge\n* Frostclaw, an awakened snowy owlbear"
