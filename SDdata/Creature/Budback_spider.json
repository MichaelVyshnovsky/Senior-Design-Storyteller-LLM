They were [[poison]]ous, but their poison was not harmful, not even if dozens of them were involved.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||7}} It took a whole [[spider swarm|swarm]] of them biting for their poison to incapacitate a man. However, they did not swarm naturally, though [[magic]] could compel them to form such a swarm.",
