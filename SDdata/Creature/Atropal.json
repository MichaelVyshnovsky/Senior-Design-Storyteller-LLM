            "Atropal Scions": "[[File:Atropal Scion - Jeremy Jarvis.jpg|thumb|230px|An atropal scion.]]\nAn '''atropal scion''' was truly one of the most perverse [[undead]] creatures willed to unlife by dark gods of death. A piece of an atropal's [[deity|godly]] flesh could become a \"godling\" itself of diminished power but just as filled with spite and evil, unless destroyed. If given unlife, the \"atropal scion\" became an unformed monster, resembling an overgrown dead fetus, sometimes with an umbilical cord still attached. Despite its appearance, an atropal scion was extremely intelligent and powerful. Unlike regular atropals, scions sought to spread evil via magically empowering themselves with knowledge of life and death."
        },
        "Personality": "The atropals spewed obscenities, stuck in perpetual state of anger at the universe and their malformed existence. These undead godling husks were hated by deities who actively tried to hide atropals underneath ancient crypts of long-dead civilizations to banish them to forgotten cemetery planes of existence. In times when atropals were unleashed on the [[Prime Material plane]], they went on furious killing spree until destroyed or neutralized. Some sages speculated that some of the [[necromancer]] kings of old were actually atropals.",
        "Abilities": "An aura of cold [[negative energy]]\n\nAtropals could not be affected by any form-altering magics, such as ''[[polymorph]]'' or ''[[petrification]]''. They were immune to energy drain, spells and abilities that affected one's mind, and were resistant to fire and ice. Also, like other undead, they were immune to [[poison]]s, [[disease]]s, [[Paralyze|paralysis]], and unaffected by spells such as ''[[sleep]]'' and those that caused instant death or harmed via necrotic magic.\n\nThese undead monstrosities had an extremely keen sense of ''[[blindsight]]'' that reached the area of {{SI|500'|'\"|long=yes}} and their ''[[telepathic]]'' abilities had even greater range of {{SI|1000'|'\"|long=yes}}\n\nUpon destruction, atropals could not be resurrected via spells as they were not willing to return to the pitiful existence.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Atropal and acererak-5e.jpg|thumb|''Atropal, being nourished to godhood.''|370x370px]]\nBefore facing their opponents personally, atropals unleashed armies of subservient undead creatures and [[nightcrawler]]s. Atropals often tried to disable any magical protection via the ''[[greater dispelling]]'' spell, especially to remove possible ''[[death ward]]s''. These undead godlings were powerful spellcasters and did not hesitate to use their sorcery to ''[[create greater undead]]'', ''[[desecrate]]'', and ''[[plane shift]]'' among others. After their opponents' wards were shattered, atropal used magics that could instantly kill their opponents, such as ''[[finger of death]]'' and ''[[slay living]]''.\n\nAtropals were very durable, as well as dexterous, and when in a fight they could use this to outlast their enemies. When forced into a direct fight, however, atropals were armed with several powerful abilities. One of these was the ''atropos burst'' ability, which allowed an atropal to sap the life force of their foe, though, being undead, they did not heal from this but rather gained additional energy, which they sometimes then used to attack a living creature with ''necrotizing touch'', which not only injured the victim but hindered their competence as well. Atropals also had a unique ability known as ''shroud of death'', which allowed atropals to repair other undead creatures while bringing harm to the living.",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 15th century [[DR]], an atropal was found drifting in the [[Negative Energy plane]] by the [[lich]] [[Acererak]] and was brought to the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] in [[Chult]] to be nourished to godhood via an artifact known as the [[Soulmonger]], which caused the onset of the [[death curse]]. The malformed wretch was nursed by a [[night hag]] coven, the [[Sewn Sisters]]. That atropal could not speak any legible language but could understand Celestial.''",
        "Notable Atropals": "*[[Xingax]], an atropal scion and a mad scientist who allied himself with [[Szass Tam]] during the [[War of the Zulkirs]]."
