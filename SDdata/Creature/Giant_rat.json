        "Description": "Giant rats were much larger than the common [[rat]], most growing to the size of a large dog. They were covered in coarse fur that was brown-black in color.",
        "Combat": "Giant rats worked exceptionally well in groups, taking advantage of their numbers to attack more efficiently. They attacked a target by biting them with its sharp incisors. Giant rats avoided attacking stronger creatures, especially those wielding fire, unless driven by extreme hunger or compelled to do so by a [[wererat]] or [[vampire]]. Giant rats were excellent swimmers, as such they were just as dangerous in the water as they were on land. \n\nThe bite of these creatures carried a potentially lethal disease known as [[filth fever]]. It was recommended that victims of giant rat bites sought immediate [[cleric]]al attention.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Giant rats could be found in the wild in the [[Silver Marches]], particularly in the [[Rauvin Vale]] and [[Sundabar Vale]], as well as in the [[High Forest]]. In urban environments they were commonly found in [[sewer]]s,{{Cite dragon/238/The Dragon's Bestiary: Spawn of the Sewers|72}} though they were liable to migrate elsewhere if a [[water cat]] moved into their territory.{{Cite dragon/238/The Dragon's Bestiary: Spawn of the Sewers|72}}\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], giant rats could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]."
