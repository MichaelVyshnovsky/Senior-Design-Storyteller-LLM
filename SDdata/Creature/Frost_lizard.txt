'''Frost lizards''' were aggressive magical [[lizard]]s that were a threat for caravans traveling through [[Icewind Dale]] and [[Spine of the World]].

==Description==
Frost lizards where small {{SIAdj|3|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} white creatures that could glide on snow and ice. Their scales' coloring made them almost invisible in snow as long as they remained still.

==Combat==
Frost lizards laid hidden in the snow using their natural camouflage until they spotted their prey. They glided into attack using their ''breath weapon''â€” spitting out ''ice balls'' at a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} range. When they approached close enough to the prey, they swiped at it with their sharp claws.

==Ecology==
Frost lizards were aggressive hunters. They especially had a taste for the horses and oxen of the caravaneers moving through the lizards' hunting grounds.
