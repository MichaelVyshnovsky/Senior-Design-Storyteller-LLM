'''Ogre zombies''' were powerful [[zombie]]s created from the corpses of [[ogre]]s.

==Combat==
Like other zombies these undead fought with their fists, though they were also known to be armed with [[greatclub]]s or [[morningstar]]s.

== Notable Ogre Zombies ==
* The wizard [[Amelior Amanitas]] owned a copper flask that could unleash a pair of fanatically loyal ogre [[berserker]]s to fight for him. If they died, the ogres would reanimate as zombies and continue fighting.
* [[Nildar Sunblight]] kept an ogre zombie as a pet. The [[Sunblight]] clan of [[duergar]] also owned a second ogre zombie, which they used to pull a [[dog sled]] when robbing the people of [[Caer-Konig]] in [[1489 DR]].<ref>

== Ecology ==

=== Usage ===
The casting of ''[[summon undead III]]'' could conjure ogre zombies to fight for the caster.<ref>
