They had green, scaled skin, green eyes, and seaweed-green, slimy hair. They had black teeth and nails webbed hands and feet long, thick necks underbites and sloping shoulders. One in ten merrow had ivory horns, especially the most powerful males.\nMerrow enjoyed tattooing their bodies. Females, especially, were often found covered in depictions of death and destruction all over their bodies.\nMerrow were ignorant and superstitious brutes their only skills were plundering and murder.\nMerrow enjoyed gold and jewels and often overlooked dull magical items in favor of glittering prizes.\nMerrow could breathe air and survive out of water for about two hours, thus they often came to the surface in search of food.\nMerrow would sometimes attack coastal settlements or \"intruding\" ships. Using their green coloration, they could hide easily, becoming effectively invisible in oceanic terrain. They attacked from cover, using longspears, and followed up their assault with talons and teeth.\nThe illithid Vestress, queen of Ascarle in 1361 DR, had a standing army with a core of 100 merrow under her command.\nMerrow territories usually encompassed an area with a radius between . A chieftain ruled the tribe, and his power-hungry orders dictated the life of the members.\nMerrow were a carnivorous species with voracious appetites, preying on all who entered their territory.\nMerrow lived in shallow freshwater caves about  below the surface. In Cormanthor, they could be found in the River Ashaba.\nSome merrow worshiped Panzuriel and served him as shamans.\nMerrow sometimes kept company with scrags.\n* Tarag"
