        "mainbody": "'''Glyptodons''' were an ancient ancestor of sloths and armadillos that superficially resembled the [[ankylosaurus]].",
        "Description": "These large quadruped herbivores had short snouts, powerful jaws, and a dome-shaped body that was plated with a thick bony shell of armor. Trailing behind their bodies was a long tail that ended in a heavy club of bone set with spikes, similar to a [[morning star]].",
        "Behavior": "While described by some as peaceful, glyptodons were known to act hostile towards other grazers and would try to chase them off. They were known to be especially hostile towards [[horse]]s and [[musk-ox]].",
        "Combat": "Their thick armor of leathery bands and heavy knobbed tail made the glyptodon a formidable adversary, capable of fending off most smaller predators. When provoked a glyptodon's first response would typically be to trample their enemy. When younger members were in close proximity of a threat, a group of glyptodons would maneuver around them to create a defensive perimeter.",
        "Ecology": "Glyptodons were often prey to larger and more intelligent predators such as [[saber-toothed tiger]]s, [[dire lion]]s, [[dragon]]s, and [[human]]s.\n\nIt was possible to train glyptodons for use as mounts or pack animals. Such a thing was often done by [[goblinoid]]s and [[orc]]s."
