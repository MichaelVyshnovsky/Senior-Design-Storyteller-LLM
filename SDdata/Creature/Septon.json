        "mainbody": "Septons were the fourth-lowest rank of hierarch modrons.\nSeptons looked humanoid, with a large head. On one side of its head was a face, with two eyes, nose and mouth. The head was hairless and was supported by a collar of sorts that encircled its shoulder area. Around this collar were seven evenly spaced small arms.\nIf forced into combat, an septon used a combination of innate abilities, spells and their sharp claws.\nLike all hierarch modrons, septons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience, clairvoyance, command, dimension door, teleport without error, and wall of force spells at will. Septons were able to cast arcane spells as well as divine spells from the Law, Protection and War domains. Septons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.\nThere were precisely 49 septons in modron society. They acted as officials who maintained order and saw to it that all regulations were obeyed. One served each quinton, four served each secundus, and eight served Primus directly. They traveled from place to place as inspectors and examiners of work and records, and were charged with transferal of information from outlying areas to the towers of the regions, quarters, and the capital tower itself.  \nSeptons were able to float through water with ease. Locomotion was provided by forcing water through its collar-like shoulder ring. They were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within  and could see in darkvision up to . In addition to the normal senses of a humanoid, they had two additional senses that had the same effects of the detect magic and detect thoughts spells."
