        "Description": "Wind gen usually had bluish skin and white hair. However, their appearance tended to change with their mood, remaining light blue when they were happy and turning as dark as storm clouds if they were angry or felt threatened. Their skin was almost transparent if viewed under bright light.",
        "Personality": "Djinnlings were often aloof creatures who provided unwanted advice to their [[Sha'ir|masters]] about how better to accomplish any given task. As materialistic creatures, they were impressed by wealth and trinkets."
