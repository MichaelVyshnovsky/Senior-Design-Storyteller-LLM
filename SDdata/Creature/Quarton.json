        "Description": "Quartons were very tall humanoids, with a height of {{SI|12|ft}}. From their back grew two large wings that resembled fans. They had four arms with multiple joints.",
        "Combat": "If forced into combat, quartons used a combination of innate abilities, spells, tail and their fists.",
        "Abilities": "Like all hierarch modrons, quartons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'' spells at will. Quartons were able to cast [[arcane]] spells as well as [[divine]] spells from the [[Law domain|Law]], [[Protection domain|Protection]] and [[War domain|War]] domains. Quartons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.",
        "Society": "There were exactly sixteen quartons in modron society, each overseeing the operation of the bureaus, sector governors, and army units attached to their region.\n\nEach quarton had a personal staff of these hierarchs attached to his staff, plus thirty-six [[pentadrone]]s who acted as a guard unit.",
        "Ecology": "Quartons were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within {{SI|405|mi|k}} and could see in [[darkvision]] up to {{SI|60|ft}}."
