Squirrels were skilled at climbing and jumping.
If given a few minutes, their teeth were strong enough to bite through rope, leather, or soft wood. And their hands were dexterous enough to pick and hold small objects. Though they couldnt carry such objects, due to walking on all fours.
Squirrels often only attacked in self-defense,
