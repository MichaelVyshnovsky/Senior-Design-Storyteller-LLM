'''Squirrels''' were common creatures found around [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
They were small critters, but possessed large bushy tails. Squirrels, which were usually black, gray, in color, had small ears at the top of their head.

==Abilities==
[[File:Speak with animals W&S.PNG|thumb|273px|''A woman speaks with a group of squirrels using [[speak with animals]]''.]]
Squirrels were skilled at climbing and jumping.

If given a few minutes, their teeth were strong enough to bite through rope, leather, or soft wood. And their hands were dexterous enough to pick and hold small objects. Though they couldn't carry such objects, due to walking on all fours.

==Combat==
Squirrels often only attacked in self-defense,
