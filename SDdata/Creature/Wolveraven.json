        "Combat": "Wolveravens attacked with their hind claws, strong bite, and wing spurs.",
        "History": "Duhlark created four different wolveravens and bred six others from those, so he considered this version of a duhlarkin to be a success. He gave one of them to [[Khelben Arunsun]] as a gift. Duhlark released several of his wolveravens into the mountains north of [[Waterdeep]] where they helped control the populations of [[mountain goat]]s and [[peryton]]s."
