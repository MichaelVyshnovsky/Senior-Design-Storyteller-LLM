'''Aasimar''' were [[human]]-based [[planetouched]], [[native outsider]]s that had in their blood some [[good]], otherworldly characteristics. They were often, but not always, descended from [[celestial]]s and other creatures of pure good alignment, but while predisposed to good alignments, aasimar were by no means always good.

==Description==
Aasimar bore the mark of their celestial touch through many different physical features that often varied from individual to individual. Most commonly, aasimar were very similar to humans, like [[tiefling]]s and other planetouched. Nearly all aasimar were uncommonly beautiful and still, and they were often significantly taller than humans as well.

While several aasimar were immediately identifiable as such, others were even less distinguishable than tieflings from their human ancestors, commonly standing out with only one unusual feature. Most aasimar had pupil-less pale white, gray, or golden eyes and silver hair, but those descended from [[planetar]]s could also have emerald skin, while those descended from [[avoral]] celestials might have feathers mixed in with their hair. Those descended from [[ghaele]]s often had pearly opalescent eyes. [[Solar]]-descended aasimars often had brilliant topaz eyes instead or silvery or golden skin and those with [[couatl]] or [[lillend]] lineage most commonly had small, iridescent scales. Many aasimar also had a light covering of feathers on their shoulders, where an [[angel]]'s wings might sprout. As in tieflings, aasimar bloodlines could sometimes run dormant for generations, reemerging after being hidden for some time.

==Personality==
Most aasimar grew up cautious around others and, like tieflings, were sometimes misunderstood, though never to the hateful extent many of the fiendish bloodlines were. Even those raised by understanding parents could not escape their strangeness, or the curiosity (or even fear) that their unique nature sometimes provoked. Many aasimar even suffered prejudice, something that deeply hurt the soul of the aasimar in question since most had an inherent bent towards empathy for others.

Aasimar preferred to keep a low profile in public, as not to draw the attentions of evil cultists, [[fiend]]s, or other beings that wished to strike them down because the their celestial nature. An aasimar would abandon the low profile if it meant striking openly at evil, though never at the expense of endangering the innocent.

Though many aasimar were good in nature, thanks in a large part to their celestial ancestors, not all were, just as not all tieflings or [[fey'ri]] were evil. Some aasimar fell into the trap of evil, corrupted perhaps by experience or the counsel and aid of an evil god. [[Shar]] and [[Sseth]] in particular took pleasure in corrupting aasimar and turning them from the ways of their celestial forebears, nursing grudges fueled by the prejudice of others. Most aasimar avoided this path, however, and a few even received direct counsel from their celestial ancestor or a creature in its service. These individuals were the aasimar most likely to manifest the stereotypical virtues of a celestial.

==Abilities==
As a general rule, aasimar were a wise and charismatic race, possessed of strong insights and a powerful allure with which most races could not compare. Aasimar were also quite perceptive, noticing things that others did not, and many could see largely unimpeded in perfect darkness, while also possessing the ability to cast [[daylight|magical light]] to aid those who could not see. Aasimar were also, like many of their celestial forebears, resistant to the effects of acidic elements, extreme cold, or electrical charges.

From an early age, aasimar often received visions, prophesies, feelings, and guidance from a patron deity, usually through their dreams. These visions, for an unfallen aasimar, came from a celestial patron (typically a [[deva]]) and gave the aasimar a sense of destiny and a desire to do what was right. Patrons were not omnipotent but could advise their charges on known evils and grant advice based on tenants to which the patron aligned.

These visions to the aasimar from a patron might cause moral conflicts to the mortal creature.  For example, an angelic messenger was a distant onlooker and thus might send visions and feelings that would send the aasimar away from helping a specific town to hurry instead to defeat an even greater evil.

==Society==

Aasimar were rare throughout [[Toril]] and, as such, had no true cities or societies of their own, much like other planetouched. Aasimar could live for the whole of their life without ever meeting another of their kind and, as such, were resigned to living amongst other races.

Very few aasimar had siblings who were also aasimar, in large part due to the rarity of a celestial or [[god]] mating with a human but also due to the fact that aasimar who sprang from ancient bloodlines long left dormant were even rarer. As a result, not many aasimar met others of their kind, though such meetings were more common in [[Mulhorand]], owing to the relatively larger number of aasimar there. On the rare occasions where two aasimar did meet, they often felt a kind of kinship and unspoken understanding with one another. Most aasimar were likely to take the side of another instinctively, regardless of personal feeling and there was a strong bond between aasimar of all stripes.

;Religion:
Because of their ties to the goodly gods and celestial beings, many aasimar were drawn to a religious path and most aasimar spellcasters called on [[divine magic]] as opposed to [[arcane magic]]. A great many become [[paladin]]s, most in the service of good, and the philosophy of [[lawful good]] paladins often resonated strongly with aasimar. Those descended from non-lawful outsiders, on the other hand, most often became [[cleric]]s, though a few also became paladins.

Like other half-breeds, aasimar did not feel, as a whole, beholden to any one god or pantheon, but many aasimar worshiped the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] and a large proportion of the race was descended from the goodly gods of Mulhorand. Many of these aasimar in particular often felt a strange bond to the animals whom their divine ancestor was a patron of. Others, particularly those born outside of Mulhorand or its neighbors, often took on gods appropriate for the nation in which they lived.

Some aasimar, who fell to evil, did so because of feelings that their celestial blood and patron visions had brainwashed them. Such aasimar who fell would lose their celestial patron but became fierce fighters, their radiant damage becoming [[Necrotic energy|necrotic]].

On the [[Outer Planes]], aasimar were the servants of many of the [[dwarf|dwarven]] and [[elf|elven]] gods, including [[Aerdrie Faenya]], [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], [[Eilistraee]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Haela Brightaxe]], [[Hanali Celanil]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Moradin]], [[Shevarash]], and [[Solonor Thelandira]]&mdash; despite not having dwarven or elven blood. The human gods [[Lliira]] and [[Milil]] also had aasimar as servants.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

;Relations:
Aasimar, despite their human ancestry, did not typically feel a strong draw to their kin but instead felt a stronger bond with other half-breeds. Many aasimar enjoyed the company of races as varied as [[half-elves]] or [[half-orc]]s, though very few aasimar got along well with tieflings, whom the celestial-descended race was instinctively wary of. [[Genasi]] were likewise alien to aasimar, who found the elemental race strange even by their own standards. Of the other common races, aasimar had little overall opinion, since [[dwarves]], [[elves]], and the like had little history of persecuting aasimar but neither did they have a history of befriending them.

==History==
Though mortal aasimar were the result of breeding between [[human]]s and celestials, [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]] were unheard of in the local multiverse prior to the arrival of the [[Mulan]]i from a forgotten plane. Drawn to [[Imaskar]] by powerful [[wizard]]s, the Mulani slaves called upon their gods for aid. Just as the gods could initially appear only as avatars so did their celestial servitors initially require mortal bodies, resulting in the first devas. Since then, devas, also commonly called aasimar in [[Mulhorand]], (a term then adopted for the mortal progeny of celestials and mortals by others), were created through other means, but all of the race shared certain qualities with these first individuals.

==Homelands==
Aasimar were most commonly found in the eastern lands of [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]], where they were the descendants of the good [[deity|deities]] who once walked among the mortals. Since the [[Spellplague]], however, and the devastation of both lands, aasimar became wandering nomads bound to no land or god and spread widely over the face of [[Faerûn]], as well as other parts of [[Toril]]. Those from outside of Faerûn were often drawn to it, perhaps by the ancestral lure of Unther and Mulhorand, and so many aasimar could be found in borderlands such as [[Durpar]], [[Murghôm]], [[Thesk]], or [[Waterdeep]], though none of these places were considered traditional homelands.

==Subraces==
===Fallen Aasimar===
Some aasimar were marked by some form of darkness in their lives, that tarnished their inner light. In most instances these fallen aasimar were either influenced by some [[evil]] power in their youth, or they themselves had turned to the ways of evil.

Fallen aasimar typically possessed greater strength than their other [[celestial]]-blooded kin. Once per day, they could release the divine energy stored deep within them to form an aura of necrosis around them for a single minute. This effect was so horrific that it often caused others to run away in terror.

===Protector Aasimar===
Yet other aasimar were tasked by the greater powers of [[good]] to protect the weak and innocent of the Realms. From their youth they were given a divine missive, along with guidance, to smite evil in the defense of those unable to fight on their own.

Protector aasimar were often more learned and judicious than others. Around once per day, they could channel their inner light to conjure to angelic, incorporeal wings from their back for one minute. They could fly at the speed of about {{SI|300|ft}} per minute and unleash [[radiant energy]] when they attack.

===Scourge Aasimar===
These individuals of [[divine]] heritage that possessed an intense drive to purge [[evil]] from the Realms. They imbued with powerful [[radiant energy]] to help them carry out their natural drive to smite evil. They were easily identifiable as the energy coursing through their body radiated outward. They were exceptionally hearty and robust individuals.

About once per day, scourge aasimar could release the radiant energy held within them in a blast that extended outwards for {{SI|10|ft}}. This power could last upwards of one minute.

Scourge aasimar often wore masks to hide away their otherworldly appearance, except when engaged in combat.
