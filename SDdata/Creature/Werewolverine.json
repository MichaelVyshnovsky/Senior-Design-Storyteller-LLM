        "mainbody": "A werewolverine, was a type of lycanthrope that could take on the form of a humanoid, a (wolverine) wolverine, or a hybrid form.Not much is known about typical werewolverines, as all statblocks are for dire werewolverines that were infected with blacktooth lycanthropy only. According to the statblock, only the size and type are the same as normal lycanthropy. Other sourcebooks record different values for other parts of the stat block, so these are not documented here.\nWerewolverines had three forms. The first form was that of a humanoid both humans and dwarves were known to be able to become werewolverines. The next form was the animal form, which in this case was that of a dire wolverine. The other form was the hybrid form, which appeared to be a furry humanoid with the head of a wolverine.\nIn the 14 century DR, several normal werewolverines were transformed into blacktooth dire werewolverines by the use of blacktooth paste.\nDuring this time, the park in the Hunters District of Silverymoon was terrorized by a trio of blacktooth dire werewolverines loyal to anth-Malar, a Chosen of Malar. Those of Silverymoon requested aid, and a group of dwarves intended to help those in need. However, Duallan Tiergar, a dwarf wizard, was bitten on the way and turned into a blacktooth dire werewolverine himself.\n* Vakennis of Cormanthor, the human Bloodmaster of the People of the Black Blood in the 14 century DR.\n* Adriken, a lackey of the night hag, Gyneweir.\n* Duallen Tiergar, a powerful dwarf wizard inflicted with blacktooth lycanthropy."
