These scorpions were either trained or magically bound to a representative, both as defenders and enforcers. One of these representatives with a giant scorpion could be found in [[Baldur's Gate]] docks ''circa'' [[1360 DR]]. The scorpion served as hands of his master, as he lost one hand as punishment, and the other was paralyzed in a fist. The monstrous scorpion was also a reminder and overseer of that Refuge Bay Trading Company to ensure he never stole from them again."
