        "mainbody": "An '''ash zombie''' was a special type of [[undead]] created by the powerful energies released in the wake of the [[Ruining|eruption]] of [[Mount Hotenow]], in [[1451 DR]].",
        "Description": "Many ash zombies appeared quite small&mdash;no larger than a child or a [[halfling]]&mdash;owing to how their intense heat caused their bodies to shrivel.",
        "Abilities": "Ash zombies were normal undead warped and mutated by the powerful energies released by the eruption of Mount Hotenow.\n\nAsh zombies were capable of creating unnatural ashes from their bodies and using them as a weapon. When attacked, a puff of this ash might erupt from the ash zombie.",
        "History": "Ash zombies first appeared after the eruption of Mount Hotenow.\n\nWhen the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] discovered them, around [[1463 DR]], they began to research ways to create ash zombies artificially. They also discovered that ash zombies developed a taste for younger victims.\n\nAround [[1479 DR]], ash zombies were common in the abandoned parts of Neverwinter, and in [[Thundertree]]."
