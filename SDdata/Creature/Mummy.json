        "Abilities": "[[File:Mummy centaur.jpg|thumb|''A [[centaur]] mummy.''|330x330px]]\nMummies caused fear in the living on sight, and any creature they touched was affected by a rotting [[curse]] called [[mummy rot]]. The rot, if left uncured, could kill its host within 1-6 months. With each passing month, the victim suffered from the disease, their skin rotted more and more, and the natural healing rate significantly slowed down. This affliction could be alleviate via the ''[[cure disease]]'' or ''[[break enchantment]]'' spells, while ''[[cure wounds]]'' was completely useless. When a creature died from the mummy rot, the disease destroyed the corpse within twelve seconds, leaving extremely little time to return them to life by magical means. A fully rotted corpse could not be resurrected by the ''[[raise dead]]'' spell. Among other diseases that were carried by various mummified creatures were [[deadeye]], [[heartsting]], [[deathbite]], and [[palsy]].\n\nAll mummies spread terror, forcing even the bravest creatures to flee in terror or be paralyzed by the looming dread.\n\nThese undead creatures could only be harmed by magical or [[enchanted]] weapons, and even these tools were only partially effective. Like many other undead, mummies were immune to spells and effects such as ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[charm]]'', ''[[hold]]'', [[poison]], and [[paralysis]], while cold was completely useless when wielded against them. Fire, both magical and mundane, as well as ''[[holy water]]'', posed significant danger to mummies.\n\nA mummy could be returned to life by a [[cleric]] with the use of the ''[[resurrection]]'' spell. However, it depended on the priest's abilities and the mummy's age. ''[[Remove curse]]'' did not affect them, while spells such as ''[[wish]]'' could return mummies to life.",
        "Behavior": "Mummies were the undead guardians of tombs and vaults of honored dead (such as kings or nobility of the ancient world). They patrolled their homes with dedication, remaining alert for signs of tomb robbers or others who would defile their assigned lair. In their state of undead existence, mummies felt hatred to all living things, attacking every creature in their way indiscriminately.",
        "Combat": "Mummies were granted great physical strength, and their scabrous touch carried a virulent curse that acted as a [[disease]], known as mummy rot. Mummified creatures used their natural weapons with the unnatural undead strength to clobber, pummel, claw, or bite their opponents. However, more exotic mummified creatures retained some of the fearsome abilities they had in life.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "[[File:Mummy of Dayan.png|thumb|''A mummy in the Tombs of Dayan raising to stop the intruders.''|340x340px]]\n\nMost commonly, mummies could be found in dry desert locations on Toril. Sealed inside ancient tombs, catacombs, and burial chambers, and pyramids' cores. Most tombs that held mummified individuals were interred within complex crypts with [[trap]]s and numerous rooms filled with the treasures, relics, and favorite items they possessed in life. These possessions often included pets, foods, aromatic [[oil]]s. Tombs that were evil creatures' final resting place often included the mummies' slaves and family members killed and interred with their cruel masters.\n\n''Circa'' [[1340 DR]], mummies could be encountered in the swamps outside the town of [[Phlan]] in the [[Moonsea]] region.\n\nShambling and moldering mummies were encountered in [[Gauntlgrym]] ''circa'' [[1479 DR]].\n\nWandering undead, including mummies, were known to plague [[Red Cliffs]] in the [[High Moor]], and especially mummies created for bog burials could be encountered in the region's peat bogs.\n\nIn [[Zakhara]], mummies could be found in the catacombs under ruined [[Moradask]], the city of Sun.\n\nIn the [[Old Empires]], mummies were a common undead occurrence in [[Mulhorand]] due to their mummification burial customs. Wandering mummy creatures could be encountered in the [[Great Vale]] and in civilized areas of the land at night and in the wastes.\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], mummies could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]].",
            "Creation": "The spell ''[[mummy creation]]'' animated a corpse into a mummy, but only for a short period of time.<ref> The [[Bane|Baneite]] spell ''[[undeath after death]]'' allowed the worshipers of the deity to return to unlife after death in forms of several types of undead, including mummies.\n\nTraditional mummy was created via a long and arduous process of mummifying a body. The corpse that was to become a mummy was first soaked in a preservative substance, such as a carbonate of soda. The soaking was done over the course of several weeks. Then the body was covered with aromatics, such as [[spices]] and [[raisin]]s. The body's hearts, brains, and liver were often removed and preserved in separate [[canopic jar]]s and stored not far from the mummified body within the tomb. The body was thoroughly preserved wrapped in linen cloth strips that sometimes held [[gemstone]]s affixed between the sheets. Some mummies, often monstrous mummies' linens were dyed and soaked in additional preserving salves and tinctures of [[herbs|herbal]] nature.\n\nWhen mummies were created to serve as eternal guards via ''[[necromantic]]'' magics, the mummy wrappings were inscribed with magical symbols, and the ritual culminated in a dark magic incantation that created the undead creature. The sentry mummy became animated when specific conditions indicated in its creation were met. These conditions typically were trespassing in the mummy's tomb, theft, or offenses against the mummy's loved ones.",
            "Relations": "[[File:Star of Cursrah mummy.jpg|thumb|''The legendary ancient guardian living mummy of [[Cursrah]].''|310x310px]]\n\nRaised animal mummies were known to serve as undead minions to more powerful beings, mummies, or other dangerous forms of intelligent undead, while monster mummies often were created to specifically serve as eternal guardians.\n\n[[Yuan-ti]] communities created [[Yuan-ti malison|malison]] mummies to serve as protectors often stationed within the snake cities,  hideouts, and temples of [[Zehir]].\n\nAspects of the [[kobold]] deity [[Kurtulmak]] were known to use mummies as guardians.{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Aspects II|6}}\n\nThe avatar of [[Jergal]], the Lord of the End of Everything, took on the shape of a desiccated and mummified creature of some unknown ancient alien race.",
            "Usages": "Mummy dust was a valued ''[[spell component]]'' used to create items enchanted with rot and disease, or ''[[undead summoning i|undead summoning]]'', and mummy bone was one of known material component used in certain spells, such as ''[[scare]]''.\n\nA coloring powdered pigment from the [[Old Empires]], known as \"mummy brown,\" was originally created out of crushed and milled mummy remains.\n\n[[Mulhorand]]i ''[[mummy's tea]]'' were foul-smelling [[potion]]s brewed using used mummy wrappings. These concoctions were used to alleviate various ailments, similarly to the effects of ''[[cure blindness or deafness]]'' and ''[[cure disease]]'' spells.\n\n[[Dust of the mummy]] was a powdered [[poison]], sometimes used in trap making. The poison was a byproduct of the embalming process, distilled out of organs removed during the mummification. When inhaled, the dust of the mummy caused an infection of mummy rot disease. The effects of the poison could be elicited with a dose of ''[[mummy rot antidote]]''.\n\nMummy wrappings were a rare commodity, valued at 40 [[gold]] [[coins]]."

        "History": "[[File:Mummy jars.png|thumb|''A risen mummy and its canopic jars.''|320x320px]]\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], an ancient magic-wielding mummy that dated back to [[-6048 DR|−6048 DR]] was raised when its ancient home city of [[Cursrah]] was unearthed. The mummy was tasked with protecting the buried city's greatest treasures. It was later revealed that the mummified creature was ruled by the life energy of [[Tafir]] of the ancient Cursrah, while the body of [[Amenstar]] was turned into a unique living mummy, awake, intelligent, and alert. Subsequently, the powerful creature was turned into dust and rags.\n\n''Circa'' [[1375 DR]], mummies, along with other undead, were in service of a [[vampire]], [[Xedac]] of the [[Twisted Rune]], who was sent into [[Undermountain]] to steal an [[enchanted]] [[runestone]] created by [[Halaster Blackcloak]].",
