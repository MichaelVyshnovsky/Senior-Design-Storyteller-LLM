        "mainbody": "Mummies were undead creatures created from a preserved mummified corpse animated by the dark gods of the desert.\n rule of dungeon survival\nThe most common mummy appeared as a humanoid creature, wrapped in old strips of linen, damaged by rot and age. However different types of mummified creatures existed. They stood somewhere between  and  tall.\n* Creature mummy These were made of corpses of animals and non-humanoids, such as centaurs, tlincallis, or crypt cats. Creature mummies varied greatly and were similar to regular mummies, however, some more exotic creature mummies were preserved via being left in hot environments being baked by cruel sun, being dry-frozen, sealed in tar, various salves and magical substances, or even preserving magics or curses.\n* Crawling apocalypse A creature that resembles a giant mummified octopus.\n* Greater mummy These were mummified priests of a god who were imbued with dark magic.\n* Huecuva Huecuva are created from divine or oath-bound creatures who have failed in their vows.\n* Mummy lord Mummy lords are often potent spellcasters.

The rot, if left uncured, could kill its host within 1-6 months. With each passing month, the victim suffered from the disease, their skin rotted more and more, and the natural healing rate significantly slowed down. This affliction could be alleviate via the cure disease or break enchantment spells, while cure wounds was completely useless. When a creature died from the mummy rot, the disease destroyed the corpse within twelve seconds, leaving extremely little time to return them to life by magical means. A fully rotted corpse could not be resurrected by the raise dead spell. Among other diseases that were carried by various mummified creatures were deadeye, heartsting, deathbite, and palsy.\nAll mummies spread terror, forcing even the bravest creatures to flee in terror or be paralyzed by the looming dread.\nThese undead creatures could only be harmed by magical or enchanted weapons, and even these tools were only partially effective. Like many other undead, mummies were immune to spells and effects such as sleep, charm, hold, poison, and paralysis, while cold was completely useless when wielded against them. Fire, both magical and mundane, as well as holy water, posed significant danger to mummies.\nA mummy could be returned to life by a cleric with the use of the resurrection spell. However, it depended on the priests abilities and the mummys age. Remove curse did not affect them, while spells such as wish could return mummies to life.\nMummies were the undead guardians of tombs and vaults of honored dead (such as kings or nobility of the ancient world). They patrolled their homes with dedication, remaining alert for signs of tomb robbers or others who would defile their assigned lair. In their state of undead existence, mummies felt hatred to all living things, attacking every creature in their way indiscriminately.\nMummies were granted great physical strength, and their scabrous touch carried a virulent curse that acted as a disease, known as mummy rot. Mummified creatures used their natural weapons with the unnatural undead strength to clobber, pummel, claw, or bite their opponents. However, more exotic mummified creatures retained some of the fearsome abilities they had in life.\nthumb|Fresh unused 230x230px\nMost mummies were not created by magical means and were simply embalmed nobles, heroes, and other important individuals. In some cases, mummification and being turned into undead guardians was reserved for criminals or transgressors who wronged a powerful leader or priest. After being interred, these mummified creatures, were known to spontaneously rise from tombs when their final resting places were disturbed. The forces that aided in the creation of these creatures could be unspeakable dark magics or greed of the interred person in life, unwilling to suffer grave robbers in death. This powerful feeling of greed could tap into the energies of the Positive Energy plane, transforming them into the walking dreadful undead beings.\nDue to their connection to the Positive Energy plane, mummies existed simultaneously on both Prime Material and Positive Energy planes.\nLike other undead, mummies were not natural creatures, did not need eat nor drink, and had no predators and natural enemies.\nthumb|A mummy in the Tombs of Dayan raising to stop the intruders.|340x340px\nMost commonly, mummies could be found in dry desert locations on Toril. Sealed inside ancient tombs, catacombs, and burial chambers, and pyramids cores.

These possessions often included pets, foods, aromatic oils.

The Baneite spell undeath after death allowed the worshipers of the deity to return to unlife after death in forms of several types of undead, including mummies.\nTraditional mummy was created via a long and arduous process of mummifying a body. The corpse that was to become a mummy was first soaked in a preservative substance, such as a carbonate of soda. The soaking was done over the course of several weeks. Then the body was covered with aromatics, such as spices and raisins. The bodys hearts, brains, and liver were often removed and preserved in separate canopic jars and stored not far from the mummified body within the tomb. The body was thoroughly preserved wrapped in linen cloth strips that sometimes held gemstones affixed between the sheets. Some mummies, often monstrous mummies linens were dyed and soaked in additional preserving salves and tinctures of herbal nature.\nWhen mummies were created to serve as eternal guards via necromantic magics, the mummy wrappings were inscribed with magical symbols, and the ritual culminated in a dark magic incantation that created the undead creature. The sentry mummy became animated when specific conditions indicated in its creation were met. These conditions typically were trespassing in the mummys tomb, theft, or offenses against the mummys loved ones.\nthumb|The legendary ancient guardian living mummy of 310x310px\nRaised animal mummies were known to serve as undead minions to more powerful beings, mummies, or other dangerous forms of intelligent undead, while monster mummies often were created to specifically serve as eternal guardians.\nYuan-ti communities created malison mummies to serve as protectors often stationed within the snake cities,  hideouts, and temples of Zehir.\nAspects of the kobold deity Kurtulmak were known to use mummies as guardians.\nThe avatar of Jergal, the Lord of the End of Everything, took on the shape of a desiccated and mummified creature of some unknown ancient alien race.\nMummy dust was a valued spell component used to create items enchanted with rot and disease, or undead summoning, and mummy bone was one of known material component used in certain spells, such as scare.\nA coloring powdered pigment from the Old Empires, known as \"mummy brown,\" was originally created out of crushed and milled mummy remains.\nMulhorandi mummys tea were foul-smelling potions brewed using used mummy wrappings. These concoctions were used to alleviate various ailments, similarly to the effects of cure blindness or deafness and cure disease spells.\nDust of the mummy was a powdered poison, sometimes used in trap making. The poison was a byproduct of the embalming process, distilled out of organs removed during the mummification. When inhaled, the dust of the mummy caused an infection of mummy rot disease. The effects of the poison could be elicited with a dose of mummy rot antidote.\nMummy wrappings were a rare commodity, valued at 40 gold coins.\nthumb|A risen mummy and its canopic jars.|320x320px\nIn 1369 DR, an ancient magic-wielding mummy that dated back to −6048 DR was raised when its ancient home city of Cursrah was unearthed.
