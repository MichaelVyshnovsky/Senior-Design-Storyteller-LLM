        "mainbody": "n ice hound was an extraplanar wolf-like creature.\nIce hounds were said to be \"cold hell hounds\", and were in fact relatives of them.\nThese creatures could not be harmed by any cold-based attacks. They were particularly susceptible to fire damage, and thus were often countered by fireballs.\nThey attacked by using their icy breath, as well as a deadly bite.\nWhen summoned to the Prime Material plane, they were often used to protect areas in freezing cold places. As such, ice hounds were known to lurk in the Frozenfar, in places such as Fireshear, Aurilssbarg, Bjorns Hold, and Icewolf."
