'''Wild Hunt hounds''', or '''Cwn Annwn''' ({{Pronounce|coon|_|ANN|oon}}), an entity that uniquely had power over the breed.{{Cite dragon/428/Court of Stars: The Wild Hunt|15}}

==Description==
These hounds were quite large,While the 3{{rd}} edition illustration of these creatures have very skull-exposed faces, this detail is not mentioned anywhere in their 3{{rd}} edition write-up. Because of that, as well as due to it contradicting other sources, that detail is excluded from this description.

==Personality==
[[File:Cerunnos-1e.png|thumb|273px|''Cerunnos and his hounds descend upon an [[evil]] [[human]].'']]
These hounds had an average level of intelligence. Some described them as being quite ferocious and bloodthirsty.

Much like Cerunnos, these hounds would fight to the death against [[evil]] creatures. However, they generally avoided attacking a hunted creature until all those who had been drawn into the Wild Hunt had a chance to do so themselves.

==Abilities==
They could invoke ''[[fear]]'' in any mortal they were pursuing, what some described as being a sort of ''fear aura'', caused by them constantly growling. Like many creatures of fey origin, they were susceptible to weapons made of [[cold iron]]. They could also see in [[Darkvision|areas of complete darkness]] and [[low-light vision|areas of low-light]], and could fly to some degree, though they were quite clumsy while doing so.

Some of these hounds temporarily imparted an effect similar to the ''[[dimensional anchor]]'' on those they bit or imparted more damage upon those bit outdoors under a moonlit sky.

Those that were properly part of Cerunnos's Wild Hunt pack had a number of unique abilities. They had an aura around them equivalent to the ''[[protection from evil]]'' spell at all times, they could make their flaming tongues cause additional pain, and they could never truly die. Instead, when killed on a Wild Hunt their bodies disappeared, then reconstituted at Cerunnos's home.

==Combat==
Wild Hunt hounds struck their foes with hit-and-run attacks in order to harry and separate them from any allies they may have.

==History==
In approximately [[1357 DR]],{{LliiraImprisonment}} the goddess [[Hecate]] sent her [[jester]] out to the [[World Serpent Inn]] to acquire some suitable [[adventurer]]s to obtain for her a Wild Hunt hound, wanting to crossbreed it with her [[hell hound]]s. He ended up choosing a group of adventurers from [[Faerûn]],

When the adventurers approached Cerunnos and explained their desire for one of his hounds he initially gave a silent refusal, twisting his face, snarling, and brandishing a sword. He then threw the sword and a [[tin]] hunting horn to the ground, revealing that sometime prior he lost his spear and true hunting horn. He then had one of his hounds bring him a [[raven]], which was feasting upon one of the dead bodies, and impaled it with the sword. 

Raven in turn would ask of them to acquire a piece of art from the recently reclusive [[Enki]]. From him they would learn of how Hecate had imprisoned the Faerûnian goddess [[Lliira]]. They then went on to free the goddess of revelry and offered the Wild Hunt hound to Hecate in return for her removing a [[curse]] she laid upon Lliira.

Following the fall of [[Celadaine]] from grace, [[Tower of Celadaine|his tower]] became overrun by [[dark fey]] creatures that had command over some fey hounds.

==Sub-Species==
;Portal hound: A variant of fey hounds that were incapable of flight, but had the ability to ''[[teleport]]'' at will. They were utilized as hunting companions by both adventurers and individuals in the Feywild. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], they could be purchased from certain agents in the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. However, availability by these merchants lasted for only a limited amount of time.

==Society==
===Languages===
Some of these hounds could speak [[Sylvan]], though generally they spoke no language.
===Relationships===
Wild Hunt hounds that didn't serve Cerunnos worked tirelessly as guard animals at the manors of [[noble eladrin|eladrin]] nobles and accompanied them on their own great hunts, which they were known to refer to as "Wild Hunts."
