        "Description": "The yrthak was generally described as appearing akin to a winged [[crocodile]], or some sort of sickly [[dragon]]. Its eyeless head featured a disproportionately large mouth, filled with yellow teeth, as well as a distinctive twisting horn.{{Cite dragon/352/The Ecology of the Yrthak|66}}\n\nYrthaks had a yellow-green color, though their leathery wings and large back-fin were noticeably more yellow than the relatively green body and head. Their tough hide and cartilaginous barbs granted them a hardiness in contrast with their frail-looking physique.\n\nThe unusual body features of yrthaks made them of particular interest to anatomists.{{Cite dragon/352/The Ecology of the Yrthak|65}}",

        },
        "Uses": "[[Gulgar]]s used yrthaks as [[mount]]s and beasts of burden. Particularly adept [[Zhentarim skymage]]s were sometimes mounted on yrthaks, as well.",
        "History": "One origin myth held that the first yrthak was once a renowned [[bard]] named Brannius of Apollo. According to this story, Brannius sang a seven-day hymn devoted to any deity that would hear his wish to play music for the entire world. Upon his song's completion, a [[trumpet archon]] from [[Mount Celestia]] and a [[succubus]] from the [[Abyss]] arrived in front of the bard simultaneously. The archon offered Brannius her [[trumpet]], promising him a rich legacy for ages to come, his songs eventually becoming known the whole world in a distant future. The fiend, on the other hand, guaranteed that her bone [[horn]] would enable the bard to reach his goal within his own lifetime. Although the decision was difficult, Brannius eventually accepted the succubus' offer. Before he could reach out and touch the horn, however, the fiend pulled him closer and jammed the horn into his forehead, fracturing his skull. Instead of dying, the bard's body warped into a strange new shape, eventually becoming the first yrthak.{{Cite dragon/352/The Ecology of the Yrthak|64-65}}\n\nShortly after the gulgars fled a [[genie]] incursion into their territory on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] for the Prime Material and settled in the [[Ramparts of Night]], they started exploiting the native yrthaks' susceptibility to their sonic attacks in order to shape them into more domestic creatures.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, while en route from [[Gracklstugh]] to [[Menzoberranzan]], a [[duergar]] army led by [[Horgar Steelshadow IV]] and [[Nimor Imphraezl]] lost 5 soldiers and a [[pack lizard]] to an attack by a flight of ythraks. Around that same year, one could find ythraks stabled by the [[Zhentarim]] as mounts within the [[Temple in the Sky]].<ref>\n\nIn [[Alturiak]] of the [[1373 DR|next year]], in the [[Land of Stormweather]], three yrthaks hidden on the forested back of a [[skwalos]] ambushed the [[Aldimar Uskevren|Sorcerer]] as he attempted to drag the great animal down to [[Castle Stormweather]] in order to flense and butcher it.",
        "Notable Yrthaks": "A clutch of yrthaks lived in a cavern about {{SI|40|mi|k|long=yes}} away from the [[Wailing Cliff]], subsisting off of the cohabitating [[deep rothé]]. By {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the mated pair and their young adult twin offspring had overhunted the rothé, so their primary food source was dwindling.\n\nAs of {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the [[beholder cult]] in the [[Temple in the Sky]] kept 4 yrthaks in their stables."
