'''Kingfishers''' were a variety of bird that could be found in the Realms.

==Description==
Kingfishers had short legs, crested heads, and long pointed beaks. Their feathers were largely deep blue or bluish gray in color, with white crests.

==Behavior==
Kingfishers had a basic, animal level of intellect and were a relatively harmless species.

==Biology==
These creatures were capable of lifting creatures, but nothing {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} above, into the air.

===Reproduction===
Kingfishers typically laid around two to eight [[egg]]s per year.

==Combat==
Like many species of bird, kingfishers attacked by means of their beaks and sharp talons.

==Ecology==
These birds primarily lived in flocks.
===Diet===
Kingfishers were a carnivorous species of bird. They preyed upon [[fish]] and small mammals, such as [[rabbit]]s. They would spear the former with their beaks.
===Habitats===
Kingfishers could be found in the forests, plains, or mountains of regions with a tropical, subtropical, or temperate climate. Their habitats ranged over large areas due to their migratory nature.

On [[Faerûn]] they could be found in [[Marsh of Tun]] in [[Cormyr]]. Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in the tropical forests of [[Kara-Tur]].

Beyond the planet of [[Toril]], kingfishers could be found on [[Krynn]]. And beyond the [[Prime Material]], kingfishers could be found alongside many other predatory birds as part of the hunting parties of [[Remnis]].

===Relationships===
Kingfishers were a [[favored animal]] of the [[deity]] [[Aerdrie Faenya]].

==Trivia==
* Many cultures considered kingfishers to be omens of death or war.
* The family crest of [[T'u Lung]]'s [[Tan]] clan was a kingfisher.
* The [[spell]] ''[[flight of Remnis]]'' could summon a kingfisher to the aid of its caster.
