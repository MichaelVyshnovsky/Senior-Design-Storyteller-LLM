        "mainbody": "vampiric dragon was a type of undead dragon with vampirism.\nIt was created when another vampiric dragon fully drained the life energy from a living dragon.\nThey desired only evil and death, and were fond of spreading tales of their treasure to lure unwitting adventurers to feed upon.\nVampiric dragons were capable of creating vampire spawn from those they drained the blood or energy of. If the victim was an adult dragon, it rose as another vampiric dragon within a matter of days, while younger dragons instead rose as mindless zombie dragons.\nVampiric dragons shared many traits with non-draconic vampires they sustained themselves by feeding on the blood of living creatures, they cast neither shadows nor reflections, and they could turn themselves to mist. While normal vampires were anchored to their coffins, a vampiric dragon was anchored to its hoard.\nLike other vampires, vampiric dragons had a weakness to sunlight. Unlike ordinary vampires, however, vampiric dragons could survive exposure to direct sunlight for a time they were instead weakened and slowed, though if they did not quickly find shelter they would be destroyed. Vampiric dragons could also be destroyed by a stake through the heart, though their immense size required a very big stake, such as a wooden spear.\nUnlike other vampires, vampiric dragons suffered no ill effects from crossing or being immersed in running water, nor were they repelled by garlic or mirrors. Though they still could not enter a home without an invitation, there was nothing stopping them from simply destroying the home and picking through the ruins for treasure or prey.\n* Capnolithyl\n* Jaxanaedegor"
