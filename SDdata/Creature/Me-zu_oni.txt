'''Me-zu oni''' ({{Pronounce|mee|zoo|_|oh|nee|refs=}}) were the largest type of [[oni]].

==Description==
Me-zu oni resembled large, tall [[humanoids]] with the head of a [[horse]].

==Combat==
Me-zu oni were skilled warriors and trained to use a variety of weapons, such as [[halberd]]s, [[lasso]]s, [[naginata]], [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[trident]]s, and [[whip]]s. They were incredibly strong, with the strength of a [[stone giant]].

==Abilities==
Me-zu oni had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', and ''[[polymorph self]]'' spells at will, and ''[[cloud trapeze]]'' three times a day. They were powerful spellcasters and were able to cast the spells of a highly skilled [[wu jen]]. Their eyesight was incredibly accurate, acting as the equivalent of a ''[[true sight]]'' spell.

==Society==
Me-zu oni were servants of the [[Celestial Emperor]]. They were soldiers in the army of the Celestial Emperor and commanded [[go-zu oni]] into battle. When encountered on the [[Prime Material Plane]], it was usually during a special assignment for the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]].
===Homelands===
Me-zu oni lived in the [[Celestial Court]].

Outside of Kara-Tur, they were known to occasionally be found the [[Yehimal Mountains]].
