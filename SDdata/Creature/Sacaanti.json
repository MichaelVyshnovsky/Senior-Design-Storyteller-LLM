        "mainbody": "A sacaanti was a type of creature that came about as a result of magical creation. It quite quite similar to an imp or a quasit, appearing as an amalgamation of the two. They were made by wizards of the Zhentarim to be utilized as familiars.\nSacaanti very much resembled small fiends. They had leathery, bat-like wings and their body was noticeably tailless. \nUnlike either of their progenitor species, Sacaanti were entirely devoted to their master-creators. Each pair of master and familiar enjoyed a strong telepathic link and emotional bond with one another. If either of them were to die, the other would be devastated. \nThey possessed a number of innate powers such as regeneration, the ability to \"become ethereal\" whenever they chose, as well as the capability to perform spellcasting. \nSacaanti most readily attacked others using their claws or venomous bite. While they were known to cast spells in battle, Sacaanti possessed a unique characteristic their masters could cast spells through them, using their senses and position. \nIn order to create a sacaanti, a mage needed to gather both an imp and a quasit in the same room. Several spells were involved in the creatures formation, including two castings of polymorph and a specifically-worded version of the wish spell. \nThe first specimens were created in Zhentarim laboratories some time during the 13 century DR."
