        "mainbody": "A '''sacaanti''' was a type of creature that came about as a result of [[magic]]al creation. It quite quite similar to an [[imp]] or a [[quasit]], appearing as an amalgamation of the two. They were made by [[wizard]]s of the [[Zhentarim]] to be utilized as [[familiar]]s.",
        "Description": "Sacaanti very much resembled small [[fiend]]s. They had leathery, [[bat]]-like wings and their body was noticeably tailless. \n\nUnlike either of their progenitor species, Sacaanti were entirely devoted to their master-creators. Each pair of master and familiar enjoyed a strong telepathic link and emotional bond with one another. If either of them were to die, the other would be devastated.",
        "Abilities": "They possessed a number of innate powers such as ''[[regenerate|regeneration]]'', the ability to \"become ethereal\" whenever they chose, as well as the capability to perform spellcasting.",
        "Combat": "Sacaanti most readily attacked others using their claws or venomous bite. While they were known to cast [[spell]]s in battle, Sacaanti possessed a unique characteristic: their masters could cast spells through them, using their senses and position.",
        "Ecology": "In order to create a sacaanti, a [[mage]] needed to gather both an imp and a quasit in the same room. Several spells were involved in the creature's formation, including two castings of ''[[polymorph]]'' and a specifically-worded version of the ''[[wish]]'' spell.",
        "History": "The first specimens were created in Zhentarim laboratories some time during the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]."
