'''Astral constructs''' were ephemeral creations of [[psion]]s, built through the use of a psionic power of the same name. They served their creator for a short time before vanishing.{{cite book/Expanded Psionics Handbook|185-189}}

==Description==
Astral constructs did not have a unified appearance: they were sculpted by the psion's mind during the manifestation of the power used to create them. However, their appearance could not hide the [[ectoplasm]] used to create them: they were milky white, and often translucent. Their size was more or less the same between constructs of similar power.

==Combat==
The abilities of an astral construct were also selected during the manifestation by the creator. Lesser constructs, for instance, might be possessed of some resistance to energy damage, the ability to fly at a modest speed, being swift swimmers, or adept at certain combat maneuvers. Greater constructs had more options for their abilities, including the ability to deal energy damage, to attack with [[poison]], superior defensive reinforcements, more complex combat maneuvers, and some even had the ability to progressively heal for their duration. Those constructs built at or near the apex of a psion's power were capable of psionic powers of their own, attacking with energy rays, teleporting short distances, [[blindsight]], or even being naturally invisible.

==History==
An astral construct attacked [[Marrec]]'s party in their passage through the [[Celestial Nadir]] during the spring of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}. It resembled a [[giant wasp|human-sized wasp]]. No manifester was ever identified; [[Ususi Manaallin]] suspected that it may have been naturally spawned in the Nadir.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|104-105|11}}
