        "mainbody": "A '''sinister''' was a type of magical [[bat]] that resembled a flying manta ray. They were considered one of the [[deep bat]]s of the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "Sinisters were jet-black in color and had {{SIAdj|9|ft|long=yes}} wingspans. They had no discernible necks, nor did they have visible fingerbones, as did true bats.",
        "Personality": "Despite their name, which came from their appearance and their tendency to hover in a creepy way, sinisters were not [[evil]] creatures. In fact, they tended to be orderly beings and most were more intelligent than the typical [[human]].\n\nSinisters loved music, and many [[bard]]s and [[Harpers]] had found themselves surrounded by a circle of silent, hovering sinisters when playing music over campfires at night in the wilderness. The sinisters were harmless; they simply loved to listen to instruments and singing.",
        "Abilities": "Sinisters were not natural flyers. Instead, they had a supernatural [[Levitate|levitation]] ability that allowed them to simply float in place. They used their powerful, large wings to propel themselves.\n\nLevitation was not their only magical ability. Sinisters were strongly resistant to magical spells and were at all times surrounded by a [[Wall of force|force field]] that extended {{SI|5|ft|c|long=yes}} from their bodies while they were alive. The force field deflected mundane and most magical missile attacks. They also had the strange ability to magically [[Hold monster|stop creatures]] dead in their tracks, which they usually used to escape from creatures more powerful than themselves. Sometimes, they would use this power when hunting, if particularly hungry.\n\nLike most primarily subterranean creatures, sinisters had [[darkvision]] that extended for a much farther distance than other creatures of the night.",
        "Combat": "They had a powerful bite, which they primarily used for hunting but could use to defend themselves if needed.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Sinisters were an omnivorous species. They could survive on carrion if they could not find other options, but they also supplemented their diets with flowers and seeds."
        },
        "History": "Around [[1374 DR]], one could find sinisters stabled by the [[Zhentarim]] as [[mount]]s within the [[Temple in the Sky]].<ref>"
