The avariel (aril-tel-quessir, or "winged folk", in Elven) were among the first of the elf races to migrate to Faerûn. However, conflict with dragons almost wiped them out before the First Flowering and while they survived since that time, they were considered by most to be myths or legends.
Avariel were more delicate than their earth-bound cousins, with hollow bones to aid their flight. They had pale skin, often porcelain white. An avariels wings were usually white, but could be black, brown, or speckled. Their eyes were slightly larger than normal and ranged in color from brilliant blues to green or purple. Their hair color was normally a silver-white or black.
Avariel society was split into two groups that coexisted together, labeled "warlike" and "peaceful". Young avariel spent time immersed in both cultures (this could last over a decade), so that no matter what sect they came from, they had a deep understanding and respect of how the other half lived.

They were one of the most ancient elven races, having arrived very early in Faerûns history. Unfortunately, they were quickly confronted with the cruel dragons who ruled the land. In response, the remaining avariels went into hiding before the First Crown War, preferring to stay on the ground rather than flying.
When the Retreat came in 1344 DR, the avariel living on Mount Sundabar failed to hear it. Queen Amlaruil Moonflower heard of them and decided to send emissaries to the Aerie, hoping to inform her winged cousins of their potential new home.
After thousands of years of keeping a low profile, by the 1370s DR they were sufficient in number to be free of the fear of extinction.
