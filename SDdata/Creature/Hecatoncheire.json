        "Description": "These outsiders were distinguished from other creatures by their profuse number of limbs, having a hundred [[humanoid]] arms and fifty humanoid heads, each of which had an unusually high degree of manual dexterity. Over their torsos they typically dressed in some form of [[enchanted]] [[half plate]] armor. In place of legs, their lower body was like that of a tree trunk, supported by a number of knobby tendrils. They ranged in height from {{SIrange|30|100|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Abilities": "Hecatoncheires were incredibly hardy creatures with a strong regenerative ability. They were immune to [[magic]]al effects releated to the mind or form alteration, such as [[polymorph]]ing and [[petrification]]. They were resistant to harm from [[elemental fire]], elemental cold, and electricity. They perceived their surroundings with a combination of [[blindsight]] out to {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} and [[truesight]], but also had telepathy out to a range of {{SI|1000|ft|long=yes}}. \n\nOnce per day a hecatoncheire could summon another of their kind to their aid, though a hecatoncheire could not do so if they themselves were summoned. They also possessed a small handful of spell-like abilities that mimicked the [[spell]]s ''[[fly]]'', ''[[greater magic weapon]]'', and ''[[shield (spell)|shield]]''.",
        "Combat": "The typically fought with a large arsenal of [[greatsword]]s or boulders, but were sometimes armed with one or more magic weapons. Because of their great strength and numerous arms, they could wield over fifty boulders against their enemies and hurl them as far away as {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}}.",
        "Society": "The hecatoncheires were confined to the plane of Carceri. According to some, they been trapped there ever since the early days of their existence. For countless ages they worked on behalf of the [[Olympian pantheon]] as dutiful jailers of the [[Greater Titans]], but eventually came to realize that [[Zeus]] had tricked them into being prisoners once more. From then on they held a bitter contempt and hatred for the Olympians, forging a new allegiance with the Greater Titans and their ruler [[Cronus]] in hopes of one day escaping Carceri alongside them.\n\nHecatoncheires spent most of their time roaming the plane of Carceri in search of people that venerated the Olympians. They would attack any Olympian god or worshiper on sight, fighting relentlessly until they were slain. On some rare occasions individuals were released from the imprisonment by other deities, wanting them to use their incredible martial abilities to slay a rival deity.",

            "History with Toril": "In the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] found themselves transported to the plane of [[Carceri]] after defending the [[githzerai]] fortress of [[Tah'Darr]] from a [[tanar'ri]] incursion. At the urgings of the fallen [[paladin]] [[Elendil]], the adventurers sought out Mount Othrys and Cronus for a way back to their Prime Material world of [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|9-10}} When they entered the crumbling palace they found Cronus to be deep into some kind of [[Cosmic Game]] with the [[marilith]] [[Cucathne]], who was entertaining him with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanar'ri staging ground against Tah'Darr.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17,32}} Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|16}}\n\nAs part of this \"game of the gods\" the adventurers each had their bodies and minds temporarily merged with a powerful [[fiend]] somewhere in the multiverse, then were placed in a combat arena.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|32}} There they did battle with [[bronze golem]]s and a weak child of the hecatoncheires,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17-18}} unintentionally slighting Cronus as they were creatures of his own realm.
