Quintons were the fourth highest rank of hierarch modrons.
Quintons were tall yet heavyset humanoids with four arms and a prehensile tail, all of which sported a five-fingered hand. They had a pair of wings that resembled fans on their backs. Upon their forehead was a diamond symbol, which denoted their rank.
If forced into combat, quintons used a combination of innate abilities, spells and their fists.
Like all hierarch modrons, quintons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience, clairvoyance, command, dimension door, teleport without error, and wall of force spells at will. Quintons were able to cast divine spells from the Law, Protection and War domains. Quintons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.
There were exactly twenty-five quintons in modron societyâ€”one stationed at each of the twenty bureaus in the region and quarter towers, and five in the bureaus at Primus Tower at the capital. They acted as the bureau chiefs and record keepers of Nirvana.
Each quinton had one hexton assistant, plus a staff of one septon, twenty-five pentadrones, sixty-four quadrones, eighty-one tridrones, and an unknown number of duodrones and monodrones.
Quintons were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within  and could see in darkvision up to .
The Great Modron March, the periodic tour of the Outer Planes carried out once every 289 years, was led by a quinton, who was also the chief record-keeper of the voyage. The march passed briefly through Undermountain, using one of the rare portals that led out of Carceri.
