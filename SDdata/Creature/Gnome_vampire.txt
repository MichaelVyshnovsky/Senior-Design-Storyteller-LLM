'''Gnomish vampirism''' was a strain of [[vampirism]] originating from the [[Domains of Dread]] that only [[gnome]]s were susceptible to contracting. By at least the {{YearlinkName|1371}},<ref> this strain of vampirism had some presence on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]].<ref group="note" name="strain">As the concept of [[demihuman]] strains of vampirism were created for and kept unique to the [[Ravenloft]] setting, it stands to reason that gnomish vampirism did not originate on Toril. The mysterious nature of Blood Curdling Scream leaves into question whether or not they are the first gnome vampire on Toril.

==Description==
Age for a gnomish vampire was apparent on their flesh, over time becoming haggard to a state of near mummification.

==Personality==
All gnome vampires were quite dour and elusive individuals.

==Abilities==
Gnome vampires retained the {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of [[infravision]] that all gnomes had, but it was further augmented. They also had an inability to speak, though the reason behind this was unknown.

===Vampiric Powers===
The gnomish strain was distinct from standard vampirism in many ways. Much like other vampires, they could climb sheer surfaces as if affected by  ''[[spider climb]]'', though they could only cling to inorganic surfaces such as earth, stone, or metal. Unlike the standard strain they could not ''[[shapechange]]'', but they could cast ''[[change self]]'' at will and maintain it for an unlimited length of time. Finally, while they could command any nearby animal to do their bidding, a gnome vampire could not summon creatures to their aid like the standard strain of vampire. Any animal commanded by them would remain by their side for 2 to 8 days before leaving.

Weaponry could not harm a gnome vampire unless it was metal and carried either a ''+1'' to ''3'' [[enchantment]] depending upon how many centuries old they were. Those over 300 years of age required a ''+2'' enchantment to harm, while those over 500 years of age required a ''+3'' enchantment.

In addition to the traditional vampiric immunities to [[disease]]s, [[poison]]s, as well as ''[[charm]]'', ''[[hold]]'', and ''[[sleep]]'' spells, gnome vampires were overall unusually more [[magic resistance|resistant to magic]] than the standard strain of vampire. They were unaffected by [[illusion]] spells, spells that duplicated [[sunlight]], and were less harmed by spells relying upon cold, [[fire]], or lightning.  Consequently, [[magic item]]s were liable to malfunction in their hands, with the exception of those that mimicked the effects of illusion spells.

===Distinct Powers===
Unlike standard vampires, gnome vampires did not have enhanced strength. They did, however, possess a debilitating touch that inflicted painful stiffness upon the muscles and joints of those touched by them. This touch could cripple and possibly even kill a creature by gradually spreading its stiffness to the heart and lungs. Any gnome that died from this touch could arise three days later as a new subservient gnome vampire if certain conditions were met (see "Creation"), though unlike other strains a gnome vampire could not turn their gnome victims into [[vampire spawn]].

Instead of transforming into a [[gaseous form|cloud of vapor]] like the standard strain, gnome vampires had the power to assume a spectral form that was comparable in appearance to a group of [[will-o'-wisp]]s. While in this form they were able to pass through solid stone walls and similar barricades, but were incapable of phasing through anything that was living or once-living material, such as wood.

Gnome vampires could twist their facial features into grotesque leering grins, inflicting an effect similar to ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'' upon those who gazed upon it, though this prolonged laughter caused pain to those affected. This ability became more powerful as gnome vampires grew older.
===Weaknesses===
Like most vampires they could be harmed by [[holy water]], true sunlight, and contact with [[holy symbol]]s. [[Paladin]]s and [[priest]]s presenting a holy symbol with conviction could [[Turn undead|turn them away]], though the older a gnome vampire was the less effective this became. They also were compelled to examine [[jewel]]s, though this compulsion would break upon being attacked, and they recoiled from [[silver]] backed [[mirror]]s.

A strange quirk of gnomish vampires was that they were incapable of entering a building unless they rapped once at a door and a living creature responded.

Whenever a gnome vampire was brought to the brink of death their body would transform into its spectral form and attempt to flee to its [[sarcophagus]]. If they took too long to reach the sarcophagus, their spectral form would break up and the vampire would finally die.

According to gnomes, the most guaranteed way to destroy a gnome vampire was to impale it with a silver [[stake]] enchanted with ''[[bless]]''. The creature's hands had to then be cut off and boiled in a natural volcanic hot spring for a full day. The vampire's body had to be placed in a masterwork wooden casket and its eyes removed, with [[precious stones]] put in their place, each worth at least 100 [[gold piece]]s. After the hands were boiled to destruction the coffin's lid could be hammered shut.

==Combat==
Due to lacking any enhanced strength, gnome vampires often fought with proper weaponry, such as [[flail]]s. They were particularly effective at fighting [[bugbear]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[kobold]]s, and [[troll]]s.

==Notable Gnome Vampires==
* [[Blood Curdling Scream]], a mysterious priest of [[Urdlen]] that wandered the [[Bandit Wastes]] of [[Lapaliiya]] with a blood-crazed pack of [[weremole]]s in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note" name="strain" />

==Ecology==
===Creation===
Any gnome that died from the debilitating touch of a gnome vampire would arise as one themselves after a period of three days, but only if certain conditions were arranged by their killer. In order to spread gnomish vampirism, the potential sire had to place the victim's body within the sarcophagus they normally slept in. The gnome vampire would then have to rest atop the coffin for the entire three day period, not even leaving to feed, so as to allow their [[negative energy]] essence to slowly seep into the victim's body. During this process the potential sire was incapable of regeneration or utilizing any of their spell-like abilities. If the process were to be interrupted, the victim would remain dead and their killer would perish. Once successfully arisen, the newly created gnome vampire would be subservient to their sire until they perished.

Alternatively, gnome vampires could occur on the world of Toril from the [[Blessing of Malphagor]], a unique [[curse]] that the [[demipower]] [[Malphagor]] would place upon any living creature who killed his high priests.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Shot in the Dark, Part I/Blessing of Malphagor}} Alternatively, high priests of Malphagor were capable of bestowing this "blessing" upon corpses.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Shot in the Dark, Part I|11}} Any gnome clerics that bore this curse would arise as a vampire one to four minutes after dying.

===Diet===
Rather than blood, gnome vampires sustained themselves by feeding upon the youthful vitality of those they touched.

==Society==
Gnome vampires were generally hermits that lived underground and rarely chose to create others of their kind as the process was quite involved and life threatening.
===Languages===
Gnome vampires retained understanding of all the languages they spoke in life, such as [[Gnomish]]. Due to their inability to speak, most communication with them was done through written messages.
===Relationships===
Gnome vampires were counted among the many strange [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[Gnome pantheon|Gnomish deity]] Urdlen.<ref>
