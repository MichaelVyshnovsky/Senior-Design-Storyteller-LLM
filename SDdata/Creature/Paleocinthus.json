        "mainbody": "A paleocinthus, also known as paleoscincus, was a species of dinosaur.\nThe paleocinthus looked like its cousin, the ankylosaurus. Their body was covered in thick bony armor. Sharp spikes extended from both sides of their body. Their armored tail ended in a cluster of sharp, bony spikes. \nDue to their natural armor, the paleocinthus was almost invulnerable to most non-magical attacks. Their sharp spines provided them with amble defensive abilities.\nThe paleocinthus was normally docile but became aggressive if bothered or startled.\nPaleocinthus were obligate herbivores and were solitary creatures.\nIn Kara-Tur, paleocinthus could be found in the jungles of the Malatran Plateau."
