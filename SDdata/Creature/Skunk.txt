Skunks were black-pelted mustelids with a characteristic white stripe running from their faces down to the tips of their tails. They were known for defensively spraying a foul-smelling musk cloud at attackers.
City-dwelling rangers often took skunks as animal companions.
Inventive kobolds were known to capture skunks in order to exploit their musk spray.
Skunks were favored animals of Cyrrollalee and Rillifane Rallathil.
