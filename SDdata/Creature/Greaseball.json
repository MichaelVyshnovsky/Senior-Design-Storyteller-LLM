        "mainbody": "Greaseballs were a rare variety of an ooze that could be summoned to the Prime Material plane by some mages alongside grease mephits and grease elementals.\nLike other ooze creatures, greaseballs were living organisms made entirely out of grease and resembled blobs of pulsating slick oily mass. They possessed low animal-like intelligence and could perform only the simplest tasks when compelled by their summoners.\nGreaseballs were slow-moving creatures that left a thick coat of grease behind as they moved, similar to the effects of the grease spell. The grease secretions were highly flammable and the creatures own bodies were highly vulnerable to fire. However, they were resistant to slashing and electricity.\nIn battle, they simply slammed at their opponents with pseudopods.\nIn the , the mad sewer-dwelling grease-mage named Aelis Siryasius inhabited the sewers of Baldurs Gate. His small patch of sewers was infested with a small army of grease mephits, grease elementals, and greaseballs."
