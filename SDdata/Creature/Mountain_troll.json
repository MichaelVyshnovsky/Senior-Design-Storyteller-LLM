        "mainbody": "'''Mountain trolls''' were a breed of [[troll]] that dwelt on mountains. They were immense, and especially brutish.",
        "Description": "However, these giants were capable of blending in with mountainous rocks, offsetting their otherwise notable difficulties at hiding.",
        "Abilities": "Mountain trolls' regeneration was not as extreme as that of other trolls, and it was insufficient to protect them from lethal blows, or even regenerate lost limbs, but it was faster and functioned normally against wounds inflicted by fire or acid. They had a strong sense of smell.",
        "Subspecies": "The particular strain of trolls most common in Halruaa were recognizable for their oversized jaws.",
        "Personality": "When in mixed groups, these slow-thinking trolls were brutal bullies, eating any creature that failed to follow their orders. In general, they had no concept of fear or caution, smashing anything that got in their way when they wanted to take something (usually for eating).",
        "Combat": "They were uncomplicated attackers, favoring crushing force and overwhelming offense. They had incredible stability on their feet, and every blow of theirs had the potential to throw any foe off their feet.",
        "Society": "Rarely alone, mountain trolls casually pushed around other giants, such as ogres and smaller trolls. They were brutal bullies, eating any creature that failed to follow their orders.",
        "History": "Mountain trolls were most common in [[Halruaa]], though they could be found in other mountain ranges within Faer√ªn.\n\nThe [[Elder Evil]] [[Pandorym]] had bound at least two mountain trolls to its service in {{yearlink|1374}}.{{cite book/Darkvision|40-43, 45-48|5}}{{cite book/Darkvision|298-299, 303|30}}"
