'''Rupture demons''' were barely sentient, sludge-like [[demon]]s that were the weakest of the spawn of [[Juiblex]].

==Description==
Rupture demons were oily and sludge-like creatures.

==Behavior==
Rupture demons were barely intelligent, possessing little sense of self and essentially no sense of self-preservation.

==Abilities==
When a rupture demon died, the energy released by their death healed a nearby demon.

==Combat==
Rupture demons attacked anything that attacked them, using pseudopods as weapons.

==Ecology==
These fiends lived as scavengers in the [[Abyss]], trailing behind larger demons and feeding on the remains of their victims. Some scholars theorized that the rupture demons' aiding of other demons via their deaths was part of some scheme wrought by Juiblex.
