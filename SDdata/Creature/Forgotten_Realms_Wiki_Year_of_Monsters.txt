2020 The Year of Monsters
The scope of the multi-editor project is to add creatures that are canon and missing from the wiki. It will also expand on creature stubs. 
Only creatures with Monster Manual-style listings of monsters  found within the various sourcebooks are to be added to this project.
These sourcebooks have many creatures
* 1e big lists
* 2e big lists
* 3e big lists
* 4e big lists
* 5e big lists
* Dragon Magazine
* Creature Stubs
* Creatures requiring cleanup
* Creatures requiring images
Books with 10 or less creatures, sorted by edition
* 1e short lists
* 2e short lists
* 3e/3.5e short lists
* 4e short lists
* 5e short lists
Stubs and such
Some creatures are already on the wiki, but are mere stubs, or are lacking an image or stats from an edition.
A creature with a ðŸ”¶ next to it is an article that needs some love. 
When finished expanding or fixing the noted task, please add

next to it.
For example
ðŸ”¶ clean up  | Regis87 (talk)
New Creatures
To keep track of what got created and by who, please do the same when adding a new monster from the list!

next to it.
For example

When a new monster is added, it is suggested to add "Year of Monsters" or even just "YoM" as the Edit Summary.
These are the typical section headers for an article about a creature, as discussed in this forum thread. You can easily cut and paste it from here and delete the ones you dont use
