'''2020: The Year of Monsters'''

The scope of the multi-editor project is to add creatures that are canon and missing from the wiki. It will also expand on creature stubs. 

Only creatures with ''Monster Manual''-style listings of monsters  found within the various sourcebooks are to be added to this project.

==Big Lists==
These sourcebooks have many creatures
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/1ebigs|1e big lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/2ebigs|2e big lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/3ebigs|3e big lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/4ebigs|4e big lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/5ebigs|5e big lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/DragonMag|Dragon Magazine]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/stubs|Creature Stubs]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/clean|Creatures requiring cleanup]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/images|Creatures requiring images]]

==Short Lists==
Books with 10 or less creatures, sorted by edition:

* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/1eshorts|1e short lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/2eshorts|2e short lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/3eshorts|3e/3.5e short lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/4eshorts|4e short lists]]
* [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Year of Monsters/5eshorts|5e short lists]]

==Project Guidelines==
;Stubs and such
Some creatures are already on the wiki, but are mere stubs, or are lacking an image or stats from an edition.

A creature with a ðŸ”¶ next to it is an article that needs some love. 

When finished expanding or fixing the noted task, please add:

<code><nowiki>{{done}} | ~~~</nowiki></code>

next to it.

For example:

ðŸ”¶ clean up {{done}} | [[User:Regis87|Regis87]] ([[User talk:Regis87|talk]])

;New Creatures
To keep track of what got created and by who, please do the same when adding a new monster from the list!

<code><nowiki>{{done}} | ~~~</nowiki></code>

next to it.

For example:

*[[Elf]] {{done}} | [[User:Regis87|Regis87]] ([[User talk:Regis87|talk]])

When a new monster is added, it is suggested to add "Year of Monsters" or even just "YoM" as the Edit Summary.
===Standardized Sections===
These are the typical section headers for an article about a creature, as discussed in [[Forum:Standardizing article sections|this forum thread]]. You can easily cut and paste it from here and delete the ones you don't use:
<pre><nowiki>
==Description==
==Personality (use for a sentient being)==
==Behavior (use for creatures with animal intelligence)==
==Combat==
==Society (use for sentients)==
==Ecology (use for animals)==
==History==
==Notable <plural creature name> (list, if more than one)==
