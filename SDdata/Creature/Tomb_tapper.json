        "mainbody": "'''Thaalud''', more commonly known as '''tomb tappers''' or '''the faceless''', were intelligent [[construct]]s designed by the ancient [[Netherese]] empire to defend it against the depredations of the [[phaerimm]]. Their existence can be traced back to the very beginning of the Shadowed Age of [[History of Netheril|Netheril's history]], when a group of [[arcanist]]s created them to seek out the source of the magical drain that was beginning to reach across [[Netheril]].",
        "Description": "Tomb tappers were {{SI|15|ft}} tall, naked, sexless, hairless humanoids with hard, smooth blue-gray skin, claws that could dig through solid rock, and great toothed maws in their bellies. Their featureless heads earned them the nickname \"the faceless.\"",
        "Behavior": "A tomb tapper retained the memories of its ancestors, which meant that their behavior over many generations still adhered closely to their original \"programming\" to collect [[magic items]] and slay non-[[human]] spellcasters. They further had an almost compulsive drive to amuse themselves by molding the rock around them into twisting shapes.",
        "Abilities": "They communicated by means of a humming sound created by skin vibrations (a language partially understood by [[mind flayer]]s) and by {{SIAdj|120|ft|adj=range}} ''[[telepathy]]''. They could ''[[detect magic]]'' at will.\n\nTappers saw via sonar (emitting inaudible sound much like a bat) that was accurate up to {{SI|440|ft|long=yes}}, making them susceptible to ''[[silence]]'' [[spell]]s. This sense enabled them to locate ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[displacement|displaced]]'' creatures and objects, and it made them immune to visual [[illusion]]s and other vision-related spells.\n\nThey were also immune to spells with mind-affecting or charming effects, such as ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[geas]]'', and similar spells. They were also immune to all fire- and cold-based attacks. When killed, they permanently turned to stone.\n\nTappers were very adept at moving through and manipulating solid rock. They could ''[[animate rock]]'' once every two hours, could summon ''[[spike stones]]'' three times per day, and could use ''[[stone shape]]'' up to seven times per day. They could also dig through rock with their claws, but used their hammers to split rock when a smooth surface was desired.",
        "Combat": "A tapper attacked with iron-hard, long-fingered hands that delivered massive damage, and it also hurled itself atop opponents to bite with its abdominal mouth (crushing and tearing armor, rock, and bone). If it didn't want to close with opponents, it used a great, 10-foot-long hammer of [[arenite]], a magma alloy harder than most rock. A tapper could wield this weapon one-handed and throw it with great accuracy.\n\nWhen faced with multiple foes, tomb tappers used their magical abilities to divide and conquer. They focused their initial assault on spellcasters, sometimes shoving them into their mouths to quickly dispatch them.\n\nIf killed, a tomb tapper's body turned to stone.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Tomb tappers were known to lend aid to [[dwarves]] and [[deep gnomes]], but were known to be hostile toward [[drow]], [[duergar]], [[mind flayers]], [[Phaerimm|phaerimms]], and [[umber hulks]]. They were known to keep umber hulks as [[slave]]s."
        },
        "Ecology": "Tomb tappers dwelt largely underground in the [[Underdark]] where their sonar and affinity for rock was most useful.\n\nTapper skin varied in porosity at will: through it, they took in needed water. Their jaws could crush rock to extract mineral sustenance. They could digest [[iron]] from blood and marrow if available, but they did not hunt to eat.\n\nAlthough the original tomb tappers had been built as magical soldiers, they had since identified their own means of procreation.",
        "History": "Tomb tappers were created during the war between the [[Netherese]] and the [[phaerimm]]. Wrought from the fusion of magic, [[Earth (element)|elemental earth]], and the bodies of nine volunteers from the poor districts of [[Netheril]], the [[archwizard]]s created the first thaalud (tomb tappers). These faceless warriors were given a lust for magic, an inherited memory (giving access to the recollections of their ancestors), an ideology of the purity of magic, and an insane hatred for non-human spellcasting creatures.\n\nTheir union with elemental earth turned the thaalud into ground-dwelling beastsâ€”delivering them into the realms of the phaerimm (the Netherese had no idea as to the source of the ''magic drain'' spells at the time they created the tomb tappers). Nevertheless, their plan succeeded.\n\nIn the centuries after the fall of Netheril, tomb tappers became independent as the world forgot the ancient methods of their creation. During the tappers' excursion into the depths, they ran afoul of mind flayers, umber hulks, drow, and duergar. Because of the tomb tappers' incredible recollection, the actions of these races were not forgotten... or forgiven. Their primary enemy, though, was the phaerimm, whom they attacked over all other targets.\n\nWith the return of [[Thultanthar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, and the subsequent refounding of the Netherese Empire in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], many tomb tappers returned to the service of their ancient masters. The returned Netherese also reintroduced the ancient method for manufacturing more of the thaalud, and soon a great number of new tomb tappers were being created as guardians, construction workers, and siege weapons."
