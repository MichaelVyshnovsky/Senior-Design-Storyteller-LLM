Angels of battle were the natural-born commanders and harbingers of war among the Astral Sea angels that served deities.
These angels were capable of firing a burst of razor-shape blades from their wings, though this severely hindered their wings for a time so it was usually an ability reserved for the end of battles. They could also cause a creature struck by them to become illuminated, bathing the enemy in light as bright as a torch.
When in battle, these angels wielded falchions. The combat tactics they were employed a combination of airborne and ground-based.
These angels served a similar function to deities as angels of valor, but were called upon for greater threats. They often acted in battles as commanders of angels of valor or mixed groups of devout creatures in service to a deity.
