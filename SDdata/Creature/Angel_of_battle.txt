'''Angels of battle''' were the natural-born commanders and harbingers of war among the [[Astral Sea]] [[Angel (astral)|angel]]s that served [[deities]].

==Abilities==
These angels were capable of firing a burst of razor-shape blades from their wings, though this severely hindered their wings for a time so it was usually an ability reserved for the end of battles. They could also cause a creature struck by them to become illuminated, bathing the enemy in light as bright as a [[torch]].

==Combat==
When in battle, these angels wielded [[falchion]]s. The combat tactics they were employed a combination of airborne and ground-based.

==Society==
These angels served a similar function to deities as [[angel of valor|angels of valor]], but were called upon for greater threats. They often acted in battles as commanders of angels of valor or mixed groups of devout creatures in service to a deity.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]],<ref group="note">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki. a group of [[adventurer]]s fleeing from [[Caer Westphal]] were ambushed by a group of angels wielding swords of black flame and wearing black [[tabard]]s, emblazoned with the unholy symbol of [[Cyric]]. They declared themselves envoys of [[Church of Cyric|his church]] and commanded the adventurers to give up one member of their party in return for their lives, saying that Cyric wished it so, or that they would otherwise face death at their hands.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Black Heart|19}}
