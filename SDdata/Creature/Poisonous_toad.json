        "mainbody": "Poisonous toads (or poisonous frogs &mdash the terms were more or less interchangeable) were a species of giant toad whose bodies secreted a weak, hemotoxic poison.\nThese creatures were largely indistinguishable from the most common, mundane species of giant toad. Like any species of toad, their skin was consistently dry, rough to the touch, and marked by many warts.\nThose referred to as \"frogs\" typically were smaller in size.\nBy biting creatures, these toads passed on a poison that sent victims into a comatose state.\nBesides their poisonous bite, these toads fought with their tongues like any other.\nThese creatures lived in colonies of up to eight members.\nPoisonous toads were a carnivorous species.\nPoisonous toads typically inhabited regions with a warm to temperate climate, sometimes living underground. Like any species of giant toad, they lived near bodies of water where they could lay their eggs.\nOn Toril they were known to inhabit the marshes of Cormyr, including the Farsea Marshes, Marsh of Tun, and Vast Swamp."
