        "Description": "Blights were plants that had been tainted with evil, usually after a forest was corrupted by an evil force. They resembled dead versions of their original plants. The first blights were spawned when the [[vampire]] [[Gulthias]] was stabbed with a stake. The stake turned into a sapling which grew into a tree. This tree released seeds from which the first blights emerged.",
