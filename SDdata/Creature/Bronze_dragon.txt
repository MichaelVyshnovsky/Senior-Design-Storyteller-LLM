'''Bronze dragons''' were a race of [[metallic dragon]]s. Curious and inquisitive, they possessed a strong sense of justice and did not tolerate any form of cruelty.

==Description==
[[File:Bronze dragon anatomy - Richard Sardinha.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''A review of bronze dragon anatomy.'']]
While most of its body was a reflective bronze color, the wings were often tipped with green. The dragon had four large horns on each side of their heads, three protruding from each cheek and one from the top of their head, pointing back towards the tail. A large frill ran down the upper part of its neck.

Bronze dragons smelled like sea spray.

A dragon egg could be identified as belonging to a bronze by the gold flecks seen when held in front of an intense white light, though it shared this trait with [[copper dragon]]sâ€”the former had fewer, bigger spots, while the latter had many tiny spots.<ref>

==Abilities==
These dragons possessed the ability to alter their form, assuming the appearance of any type of animal or humanoid creature they choose. As such, many could have encountered a bronze dragon without ever being the wiser.

Bronze dragons could [[speak with animals]], [[create food and water]], [[fog cloud|make fog]], [[control water]] and [[control weather]], and [[detect thoughts]].

===Breath Weapon===
Bronze dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of electricity similar to a ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and the second was either a cone of gas that affected the minds of creatures caught in it, causing them to flee for a short time, or a cone of repulsion energy which physically pushed enemies away.

==Society==
[[File:Ancient_Bronze_Dragon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The majesty of an ancient bronze dragon, in full display.'']]
They truly enjoyed observing and interacting with smaller creatures, most especially [[human]]s. They often went out of their way to help them, such as rescuing humans from a shipwreck or a dangerous foe. In many of these instances, the bronze dragon would transform itself into a human, so that those who it helped never knew who really did the rescuing. 

They always sought justice as best they could, and could not abide to see any creature being treated with cruelty of any sort. 

They were probably the most social species of dragon, and often swam and played together in groups.

===Lair===
Bronze dragons were often found along the coastal regions of the world. They liked to dwell along the sea, to make use of their aquatic abilities. Given its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair was quite naturally underwater. The bulk of the lair was above water level.

===Diet===
Bronze dragons, as with some other dragon breeds, were unable to chew their food. Hence, to aid digestion, they swallowed small stones, pieces of metal, and even coins, which went into a small second stomach like a bird's gizzard. These [[Wikipedia:gastrolith|stomach stones]] ground down their food and were eventually expelled in waste.<ref>{{Cite dragon/134/The Ecology of the Red Dragon|36}}

===Parenting and development===
[[File:bronze dragon wyrmling-5e.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|''A bronze dragon wyrmling.'']]
Bronze dragons mated for life, and took their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness.

A newly-hatched bronze wyrmling appeared yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales gradually shifted to bronze as it matured.
