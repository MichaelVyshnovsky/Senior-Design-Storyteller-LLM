'''Crustaid''' were a species of sea life that served as defenders of the isle of [[Evermeet]] in the [[Trackless Sea]], obeying Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]]'s will.

==Description==
Crustaids varied in size, {{SIrange|30'|50'|'"}}. The number of tentacles a single creature possessed was dependent on its size. A {{SI|40'|'"|long=yes}} crustaid had twenty tentacles, and {{SI|50'|'"|long=yes}} â€“ twenty five. The creatures anchored themselves to the ocean floor via a special appendage that penetrated the ground several hundred feet deep, making it virtually unmovable unless a crustaid was in the process of moving itself. The anchor limb opened up inside the ground in a shape resembling a parasol. Their bodies resembled gargantuan lumps of [[coral]] and rock with large hollow tubes that housed its many tentacles. It had thousands of [[centipede]]-like small legs that grew in between of the creature's underbelly segments that resembled hard [[alligator]]-like hide. At the underbelly's center was an opening that served as its mouth, similar to that of a [[starfish]]. When they fed, crustaids shoot their stomachs out, enveloping and digesting prey.

==Behavior==
Crustaids slumbered on the bottom of the ocean, remaining placid until it was issued a command by Queen Amlaruil Moonflower, attacked, or something attracted the creature's attention. Only objects the size of a ship were worthy of crustaids' attention, shown by long tentacles ending in sharp hooks that emerged from tubes of its body.

==Abilities==
All of its tentacles had a thick hide that could withstand a lot of punishment but were vulnerable to ''[[swords of sharpness]]''.

The creatures' "vision" detected motion and light via hard sensors located all throughout their shells.

==Combat==
Hooked tentacles were crustaids' main weapon, moving with deadly swiftness. Once crustaid aimed at its prey, it shot the tentacles out that moved with the speed of half a mile per minute, and each attack was made by two to eight tentacles at a time, hooking the prey and holding it in place. Once captured, crustaid waited for Queen Amlauril's commands, whether the target needed to be released or destroyed, crushed by the tentacles.

Once its targets were hooked, crustaids began pulling themselves up to the surface, towards the prey, whilst still remaining anchored to the ocean floor. Due to the creature's size, ships shorter than {{SI|60'|'"|long=yes}} in length were pulled under and consumed. On rare occasions, when the Queen ordered or the creature was hungry, it attacked smaller creatures, such as [[humanoid]]s.

==Ecology==
The only known habitat of crustaids was the ocean floor around the [[elf|elven]] island of Evermeet, and the mouth of [[River Shaelyn]].

Crustaids were omnivorous creatures that digested living creatures and ships' wood alike. They could not consume [[gem]]s, [[metal]], nor stone. The ocean floor around them often was littered with metal parts of ships, and treasures, that excluded magic [[scroll]]s and [[potion]]s as they were consumed.
