        "mainbody": "'''Hairy spiders''' were a variety of [[subterranean spider]], although they could be found on the surface as well. They were favored by [[drow]] [[wizard]]s as [[familiars]].",
        "Description": "Hairy spiders were about the size of a [[human]] hand. Despite their size, they were strong enough to carry small items, and so were sometimes entrusted with small treasures by wizards using them as familiars. They were hairy and black.\n\nAbout 40% of hairy spiders had the innate ability to [[see invisibility|detect invisible creatures]].",
        "Behavior": "Hairy spiders were vicious hunters. They could not spin webs, but they could climb on the webs of other spiders.",
        "Combat": "Hairy spiders swarmed on their target&mdash;sometimes as many as forty would cover the body of a single [[humanoid]]&mdash;infecting them with their venomous bites and tearing out chunks of flesh. They were unafraid of fire and were remarkably difficult to crush or throw off, and so had to be individually plucked off or struck once they latched onto a target.\n\nThe venom of a hairy spider was not very potent, but could leave a victim feeling sluggish and slow. Hairy spiders themselves were immune to all known spider venoms.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Hairy spiders could be found in any non-arctic environment, but often dwelt in and around [[drow]] settlements in the [[Underdark]], as well as in jungles, tombs, and caverns.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|62}}"
