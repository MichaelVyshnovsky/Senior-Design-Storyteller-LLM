        "mainbody": "'''Living spells''' were [[spell]]-effects that were given permanence and some form of sentience, often as a result of unpredictable [[magic]]al reactions or lingering dweomers from other-worldly or ancient arcane sources.",
        "Description": "They appeared as permanent manifestations of regular spell-effects but did not dissipate after a given duration. Rather they remained in existence and moved with distinct purpose and self-actualization.",
        "Abilities": "Living spells retained the powers of their spell-effect counterparts and could affect the world in the same manner.\n\nIt was observed that their mere presence could recharge [[magic items]] or alter the magical powers wielded by others.",
        "Combat": "All living spells were immune to a myriad of harmful and debilitating effects including physical exhaustion, [[paralyzation]], [[petrification]], being [[poison]]ed, among others.\n\nDepending on the spell with which they were brought to life, some of them could be frightened or physically restrained.",
        "Society": "Living spells typically haunted an area that was greatly affected by magical energy, whether that was an area of [[wild magic]] or one that had been affected by [[eldritch]] powers.",
        "Ecology": "[[File:Spellamber.png|thumb|''A hunk of spell amber.'']]\nAfter a living spell was destroyed, it left behind the substance called ''[[spell amber]]''. It resembled [[amber]], or a colored piece of translucent glass imbued with some magical properties. ''Spell amber'' could be used in restoration of ''[[Lifeforged]]'' [[weapon]]s.",
        "History": "Living spells could be found in a variety of locales found throughout the Realms, over the course of several centuries. They were often associated with dweomers that lingered from [[Faer√ªn]]'s ancient magocracies, namely the ancient empire of Netheril,\n\nMany living spells that were let loose from [[Undermountain]] by the Mad Mage [[Halaster]] during [[Halaster's Higharvestide]], in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. While many of these were since contained by the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and trapped within the [[Citadel of the Bloody Hand]] in [[Mount Waterdeep]], some remained even as late as the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nAs of the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, living spells were observed in the land surrounding the [[Ring of Gray Flames]] in [[Rashemen]].\n\n''Circa'' the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Dragonlords of Westgate]] spoke of living spells serving as guardians that presided over the \"true lair\" of the [[dragon]] [[Kisonraathiisar]].\n\nAs of the late 1480s DR, many living spells still languished in the frozen necropolis of [[Ythryn]], set deep beneath the [[Reghed Glacier]].",
        "Notable Living Spells": "[[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]] had become a special kind of living spell known as an '''arcanaweave'''.{{cite book/Expedition to Undermountain|18}}\n\n[[Listle Onopordum]] was an illusion who acquired self-awareness and became an [[illusionist]] herself. She became a Hero of [[Phlan]] and was granted full life as an [[elf]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"livingspell\">While the living spell was created long after Listle's appearances, she fits perfectly the lore established for their creation, so this article assumes her to be one.\n\n[[Everlast]] was a living spell that resided in the ruined [[Spire of Iriolarthas]] millennia after the collapse of Ythryn.\n\nThe [[Hand That Sings]] was a living spell that lingered [[Waterdeep]] created one of Halaster's apprentices using two distinct spells, ''[[handfang]]'' and ''[[magic mouth]]''.\n\nOther known examples of spells that have been given life included: ''[[unseen servant]]''; ''[[glitterdust]]'' and ''[[fireball]]'', used to make a [[glitterfire]]; ''[[blasphemy]]'' and ''[[blade of disaster]]''."
