The '''guardians''' were the [[construct]] sentinels and defenders of the [[Hall of Legends]] in the [[Utter East]]. They were, in short, very tough, very powerful, and very dangerous.

==Description==
The guardians were giant men of [[bronze]] with mighty muscular builds and clad only in horned helms, loin clothes, and boots. Their eyes and their fists were afire with their green archflame.While only described as a "diligent bronze sentinel", based on its appearance and apparent construct nature, this article assumes the Guardian is indeed made of bronze.

==Abilities==
Guardians commanded a divine fire called "archflame". It was green in color and could harm even creatures immune to natural and magical fire. They pounded their foes with their flaming fists and hurl balls of archflame that could ignite an area, burning creatures caught within or even flying overhead.

They were resistant to all physical attacks and immune to all magical spells, and they could not be damaged by fire, whether natural or magical or their own divine flame. However, they could not be healed, by spells, [[healing salve]], [[berserker brew]], or [[boar burger]]; instead, they could only be repaired of what damage they took.

==Combat==
Guardians were summoned from the realm of Immortals via the portals lying outside the Hall of Legends. They attacked all they saw, handily destroying them, before returning to stand before the Gate of Immortals that led into the Hall of Legends itself.

==Personality==
They were known to be diligent.

==History==
[[File:Guardians 2 B&M.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Guardians emerging from portals to counterattack the Legendary Campaign forces with archflame.'']]
During the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]), the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]], after conquering the whole [[Utter East]], was destined to fight another great battle, this time at the Gate of Immortals, where the Guardians appeared to defend and counter-attack. In a lengthy bloodforge battle, the Legendary Campaign forces defeated the opposing army and all the Guardians. Finally, they broke through the Gate of Immortals into the Hall of Legends, and the leader became an Immortal themselves.
