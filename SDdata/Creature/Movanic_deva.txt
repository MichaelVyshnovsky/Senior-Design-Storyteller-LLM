Movanic devas were a kind of angel and members of one of the three orders of the devas, the others being astral devas and monadic devas. The most privileged and worldly of devas, movanic devas oversaw the Prime Material Plane, the Negative Energy Plane, and the Positive Energy Plane.

Movanic devas loved battle, though not to the extent of the monadic devas. Reacting swiftly and never taken by surprise, they tended to dive into melee, with firm grips on their flaming swords. They fought with skillful and rapid attacks.
By parrying with their flaming sword, a movanic deva could deflect missiles and hurled weapons and counter rays and other spells that targeted them alone, even ones that were unavoidable, like magic missile. However, they had to be aware of an incoming attack to deflect it, and they could not deflect two simultaneous strikes.
Movanic devas possessed all the powers, protections, and traits common to devas and to other angels, and many more of their own. They were immune to injury from mundane and minor magical weapons.
Whether with the spell polymorph self or an inherent ability to change shape, they could change their form into that of any humanoid, from halfling to human in size, or into an animal.
With the soothing presence of nature itself, a movanic deva had a calm nature that creatures of the natural world invariably found pleasing. No animal or plant would willingly attack one, not unless compelled by magic. It seemed they could not even be harmed by plant life. However, reptiles and similar creatures, and monstrous creatures, could attack them freely.
Possessing a divine equilibrium, movanic devas were immune to the deleterious effects of planes suffused with either negative energy or positive energy, making them immune to death spells and loss of experience or life-force. Whether the energy was negative or positive was all one and the same to them.
In addition to the common spells of devas, movanic devas were also reported to cast cause or cure blindness, detect traps, and neutralize poison or anti-magic shell, protection from normal missiles, and spell turning, and they could use any invocation/evocation spell they wished, once a day. Later, it was reported they could cast atonement, bless weapon, commune, consecrate, create food and water, cure serious wounds, daylight, death ward, divination, ethereal jaunt, hallow, neutralize poison, prayer, and protection from arrows and raise dead. 
When a deva died on the Prime Material plane or the Elemental planes, all parts of their body, what clothes they wore, their flaming swords, and their other possessions vanished completely. Only their material body was destroyed, while their immortal spirit returned to their home plane. It took ten years to regain the power to manifest a corporeal form. If they died on any other plane, then they were destroyed utterly.
Devas of all kinds were known to serve the deities Azuth, Ilmater, and Mystra, while movanic devas in particular served Deneir, Lliira, and Milil. Another movanic deva, called the Sannyasi, served the Serene Abhirati, a goddess of the Utter East.
A good and mighty spellcaster could briefly summon and command a movanic deva with summon monster VII, or long-term with gate or planar ally.
* The Sannyasi, a movanic deva, was appointed by the Serene Abhirati to watch over her realm of Langdarma in the Yehimal Mountains. He had served in this role for 10,000 years by the 14th century DR.
