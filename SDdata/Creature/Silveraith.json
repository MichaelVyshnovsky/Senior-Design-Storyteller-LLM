        "Description": "Appearing similar to [[ghost]]s, silveraiths manifested as skeletal forms with hints of the clothing they wore in life. Their bodies were translucent and [[incorporeal]], emitting a soft blue glow.\n\nA silveraith lacked a physical form, so their ability to interact physically with the [[material plane]] was greatly limited. Along with the usual differences between incorporeal [[undead]] and the living, silveraiths were also impervious to the effects of cold, electricity, and [[polymorph]]ing.",

            "Create Spawn": "One way that silveraiths could propagate was if an [[arcane]] or [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcaster was slain by the backlash negative energy of their magic absorption power. The defeated spellcaster would then rise as a silveraith in one to four days.",
            "Negative Energy Touch": "The touch of a silveraith could pass through even armored foes to ''[[inflict serious wounds]]'' upon an enemy.",
            "Magic Absorption": "Much like a ''[[rod of absorption]]'', a silveraith could absorb the energy of [[spell]]s. However, rather than storing that energy, a silveraith would convert it in a wave of backlash negative energy redirected at the original caster."
