        "mainbody": "Silveraiths were incorporeal undead that could only be created in areas of particularly potent negative energy.\nAppearing similar to ghosts, silveraiths manifested as skeletal forms with hints of the clothing they wore in life. Their bodies were translucent and incorporeal, emitting a soft blue glow.\nA silveraith lacked a physical form, so their ability to interact physically with the material plane was greatly limited. Along with the usual differences between incorporeal undead and the living, silveraiths were also impervious to the effects of cold, electricity, and polymorphing.\nSilveraiths were able to harm living creatures with the merest touch of their limbs and although they had a number of resistances and abilities they were especially potent against spellcasters. In addition, they still retained all the powers, experience, and special qualities they once had in life.\nCreate Spawn One way that silveraiths could propagate was if an arcane or divine spellcaster was slain by the backlash negative energy of their magic absorption power. The defeated spellcaster would then rise as a silveraith in one to four days.\nNegative Energy Touch The touch of a silveraith could pass through even armored foes to inflict serious wounds upon an enemy.\nMagic Absorption Much like a rod of absorption, a silveraith could absorb the energy of spells. However, rather than storing that energy, a silveraith would convert it in a wave of backlash negative energy redirected at the original caster.\nThe personality and experience of a silveraith was undiminished in undeath.\nOn Marpenoth 2, 1372 DR, the drow priestess of Kiaransalee, Irae Tsarran, used the power of the Undying Temple and her claw of the revenancer to transform the Archmage of Maerimydra, Duneth Wharreil, into a silveraith.\n* Duneth Wharreil"
