        "Abilities": "These creatures were capable of assuming the form of almost any animate creature and inanimate object. A protein polymorph could even transform itself into several forms, such as a dozen [[kobold]]s, which were all connected via a near-invisible cord of protoplasm. However, they could not accurately copy facial expressions or replicate the sound of speech. Their forms would possess the equivalent strength of the creature or item they imitated, but would not possess their unique abilities.",
        "Combat": "Protein polymorphs generally tried to bludgeon, enfold, and crush their prey.",
        "History": "In the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a protein polymorph was terrorizing the [[pony]] fields of [[Tyrluk]].{{Cite dungeon/14/Masqueraider}}",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Protein polymorphs were carnivorous creatures, known to eat living beings regardless of their type and size."
