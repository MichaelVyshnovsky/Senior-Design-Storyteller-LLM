A direhelm was an undead creature created using the foul rituals found in the Codex of Araunt. They were bound to serve their creators, the Eminence of Araunt.
Direhelms resembled the upper part of a set of plate armor. Even though they were made of metal, they were extremely silent.
Direhelms were created by raising the spirits of fallen warriors, using the unique rituals of the Eminence. The only purpose of their existence was to serve the goals of the Eminence.
Direhelms were mostly found protecting tombs and mausoleums across Laerakond, or in the deathways.
