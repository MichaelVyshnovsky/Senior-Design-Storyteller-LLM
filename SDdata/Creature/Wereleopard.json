        "Description": "These shapechangers had a hybrid form that was of a humanoid shape, but with the features of a leopard (a great [[cat]]). Wereleopards had leopard-like feet, tail, fur, and face. They were excellent at climbing and prowling stealthily, even when encumbered or moving at high speeds.",
        "Behavior": "Wereleopards were hunters that were never found in groups larger than a pair. They could leap up to 15 ft (4.6 m) from a crouching position, which they used to surprise foes. Although these spotted lycanthropes were not considered powerful [[werecat]]s overall, they were remarkably intelligent.",
        "Society": "They were noted to dwell near villages close to jungles."
