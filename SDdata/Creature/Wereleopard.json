        "mainbody": "A wereleopard was an intelligent lycanthrope that could transform into a humanoid-leopard hybrid.\nThese shapechangers had a hybrid form that was of a humanoid shape, but with the features of a leopard (a great cat). Wereleopards had leopard-like feet, tail, fur, and face. They were excellent at climbing and prowling stealthily, even when encumbered or moving at high speeds.\nWereleopards were hunters that were never found in groups larger than a pair. They could leap up to 15 ft (4.6 m) from a crouching position, which they used to surprise foes. Although these spotted lycanthropes were not considered powerful werecats overall, they were remarkably intelligent.\nThey were noted to dwell near villages close to jungles."
