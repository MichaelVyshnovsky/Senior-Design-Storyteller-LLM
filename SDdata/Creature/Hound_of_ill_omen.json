        "mainbody": "The '''hound of ill omen''' was a legendary, planar canine beast that appeared to punish mortals for major transgressions against a [[deity]] or to defend [[shadow mage]]s that called upon its protection.",
        "Description": "This creature appeared to be a dark, shadowy [[wolf]]-hound that stood {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder.",
        "Behavior": "The hound of ill omen had a basic, animal level of intelligence.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Offensive": "Upon appearing, they unleashed a booming howl that all creatures within {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} of it could hear. Afterwards, the hound of ill omen would walk off.\n\nThose who could both see and hear the hound would suffer from the magical effect of its howl&mdash;the next ten injuries they suffered would be more severe. If ''[[remove curse]]'' was cast on the target soon after, this would be decreased to five. Until the requisite number of injuries was met, no manner of healing [[spell]]s would work on the target. In addition, the injuries sustained had to be outside of a creature's control. If the victim of a hound of ill omen was involved in its killing, then their curse would become even more severe and ''remove curse'' could not lessen it.\n\nCreatures subjected to the howl of a hound of ill omen were immediately aware of their transgression against a deity and received an empathic feeling of both death and dread. However, they would be unaware of the nature of their [[curse]] until they first suffered an injury."
