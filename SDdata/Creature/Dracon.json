        "mainbody": "Despite their caution, dracons maintained cordial relationships with humans, elves, dwarves, and even [[mind flayer]]s. They were all collectively referred to by the dracons as \"the deformed\", and were all considered to be a single race. Dracons usually confusedly described other humanoids as possessing mixed traits that belonged to multiple races. They regarded [[lizardfolk]] as their disabled kin, and frequently adopted lizardfolk into their herds. Centaurs were regarded as allies, [[beholder]]s as comical beings, and [[dragon]]s were seen with awe. Dracons hated the neogi.\n\n===Religion===\nThe dracon religion embraced dracon counterparts to [[human]], [[elf|elven]], and [[dwarf|dwarven]] deities. The dracon pantheon, known as the [[Herd of the Ub-Kalla]], was pictured as a great herd that always moved together. It was led by [[Ub-Kalla]], the Full Leader, a deity of wisdom and leadership who always knew the right course of action. The term also referred to mortals whose decisions were in perfect accordance with dracon ideals. It was a great honor for an individual to be called Ub-Kalla.\n\nThe pantheon included a spider-like Dark God, an evil tempting deity who snatched children who strayed too far from their herds. Its physical description led some sages to believe that it represented the [[neogi]].",
        "Description": "A dracon had a heavy, gray body that resembled the body of a [[brontosaurus]] with a long tail and flat feet akin to those of an [[elephant]], the upper body of a [[human]], and the head of a [[dragon]]. They could run considerably faster than [[humanoid]]s. Their hands had six fingers each, ending in claws.\n\nDracons spoke [[Draconic language|Draconic]] and their [[Dracon language|own language]]. Although capable of speaking [[Common]], they lacked fluency and did so with a thick accent.",
        "Personality": "Dracons were sometimes described as stuffy, and more ready to retreat than to join a fight.",
        "Combat": "As a highly civilized race, dracons abode by a strict and stylized dueling code when solving disputes among themselves. Despite not expecting other races to be bound to their terms, dracons were honor-bound to accept them if properly challenged by an outsider, except in special cases.\n\nThe challenge code proceeded according to the following steps:\n\n# One dracon challenged another;\n# The challenged dracon had the choice of weapons;\n# The challenger named the terms of the challenge (to the death, first blood, ''etc.'');\n# The challenged named the location and time for the duel to happen (within reason).\n\nTheir weapons of choice were thin [[longsword]]s, but dracons were also proficient in wrestling and with their claws. They were also fond of [[dart]]s and [[halberd]]s, which were most commonly used as ceremonial weapons. They wore armor that was also ritualistically donned before battles.",

        "History": "Dracons had never been seen in the known [[crystal sphere]]s until the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn [[1362 DR]], two young dracons, named [[Chirp]] and [[Trivit]] were guests of the elves at [[Evermeet]], having come with the elven wizard [[Vallus Leafbower]] and the human from [[Krynn]], [[Teldin Moore]]. They were seeking answers about the [[Cloak of the First Pilot]] and the legendary ship [[Spelljammer (spelljammer)|''Spelljammer'']]. While not granted an audience with [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Queen Amlaruil]], the two dracons were permitted to explore the palace gardens, something that they were more than delighted to do.",
