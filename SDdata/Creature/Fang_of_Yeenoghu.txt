A '''Fang of Yeenoghu''' was a [[gnoll]] that had been been possessed by a [[demon]]ic spirit, a gift bestowed upon them by the [[demon lord]] [[Yeenoghu]]. They were considered the Lord of Savagery's most favored servants.

==Abilities==
Whenever a Fang of Yeenoghu slew another creature, the victim's corpse could in a sense birth new gnolls. Any [[hyena]] that feasted upon the remains of a Fang's prey would initiate a horrific transformation. The hyena's body would burst open, and a fully-grown mature gnoll would emerge from its viscera. This frightful metamorphosis reflected the moment when the first gnolls were spawned by Yeenoghu himself.

==Combat==
Fangs of Yeenoghu often wielded 'cudgels of bloody teeth', massive [[greatclub]]s studded with teeth that seeped blood.

==Society==
Yeenoghu's chosen garnered further favor from the demon lord by capturing mortals as slaves and dragging them down to [[Death Dells|his domain]] in the [[Abyss]]. They often served as [[shaman]]s that presided over rituals dedicated to the Prince of Gnolls.

==Notable Fangs of Yeenoghu==
* [[Cyhzka]], the Fang that spawned the gnolls of the [[Cackling Chasm]].
* [[Krurg Mucusface]], one of Yeenoghu's servants who was captured on the infernal battlefield of [[Avernus]] and taken prisoner.{{Cite adventurers league/Consequences of Choice|10, 15}}
