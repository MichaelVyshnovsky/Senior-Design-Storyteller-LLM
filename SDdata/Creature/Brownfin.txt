Brownfin was a species of freshwater fish found in streams and rivers of Cormyr, the Kings Forest, and in the cold waters of Dathyl.
Brownfins were carnivorous creatures like the majority of fish. Brownfins were bigger than minnows, which they consumed, while river eels were bigger than brownfins and consumed them in turn.
In 1348 DR, delicious roasted brownfin fish were a part of Florin Falconhands and Narantha Crownsilvers morningfeast along with roasted rabbit and fresh cavanter buds.
