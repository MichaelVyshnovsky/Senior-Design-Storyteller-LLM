'''Greatwyrms''' were [[dragons]] that had achieved [[deity|godlike]] abilities, approaching the powers of the aspects of [[Tiamat]] and [[Bahamut]].

==Abilities==
Greatwyrms were massive, exceeding the size of any other kind of dragon and rivalling the largest creatures in existence. Although their exact powers varied with each type of greatwyrm, in general all greatwyrms had abilities that allowed them to return to near-full strength just before death. They also all possessed extraordinarily heightened ''[[dragonsight]]'', which allowed them to be aware of events and activities across many [[planet|worlds]] of the [[Material Plane]]. Many of their other abilities were more powerful versions of those of the normal [[Chromatic dragon|chromatic]], [[Metallic dragon|metallic]], or [[Gem dragon|gem]] dragon from which the greatwyrm had ascended:

* '''[[Chromatic greatwyrm]]s''' were cloaked in the power of their [[dragon breath]], and were able to make spears out of arcane power. 
* '''[[Metallic greatwyrm]]s''' could summon maelstroms of elemental power, and their breath was able to drain the energy of their foes. 
* '''[[Gem greatwyrm]]s''' appeared to be made of [[diamond]], and possessed incredibly powerful [[psionics]], especially ''[[telekinesis]]''.

==Society==
According to [[Fizban]] the Fabulous (one of Bahamut's aspects), greatwyrms were normally created when [[dragon aging|ancient]] dragons, usually at least twelve centuries old, ate or ritually merged with their "echoes" from other worlds, or consumed their energies in other ways. A powerful dragon could be helped along this path by one of the dragon gods. 

Becoming a greatwyrm was akin to achieving apotheosis,

==Notable Greatwyrms==
* The [[Thanes of Sardior]], a group of five greatwyrms (one of each of the five types of gem dragons) who intended to absorb every one of their echoes with the ultimate goal of coming together and reforming [[Sardior]].
* [[Aasterinian]], a [[Brass dragon|brass]] greatwyrm who served as a messenger for the dragon gods, and was often considered a goddess of invention.
* [[Ashardalon]], a [[Red dragon|red]] greatwyrm who devoured his echoes with the aid of a [[balor]].
* [[Astilabor]], a [[Topaz dragon|topaz]] greatwyrm who was considered a goddess of greed.
* [[Chronepsis]], a [[Black dragon|black]] greatwyrm who was considered a god of fate.
* [[Laerahkralan]], who covertly interfered in affairs of state throughout the [[Shining South]]
* [[Lendys]], a [[Silver dragon|silver]] greatwyrm renowned for enforcing justice among dragonkind, and thus often considered a god of justice.
* [[Tamara]], a silver greatwyrm sometimes considered a goddess of life and mercy.
* [[Velsaertirden]], a [[steel dragon]] greatwyrm sage{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-28 - Velsaertirden}}
