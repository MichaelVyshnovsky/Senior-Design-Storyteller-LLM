        "mainbody": "A '''wilora''' was a [[magical beast]] that could steal memories and appearances with its gaze.",
        "Description": "Wiloras had stork-like bodies with prismatic-hued feathers on their body, head, and wings, with blue legs. Their beaks were straight, sharp, and [[raven]]-like. It looked like a rainbow-colored bird of paradise with a bright colorful crest and long tail feathers.",
        "Abilities": "During the day, they were stuck in their true forms, but at night they could [[polymorph]] into any large or smaller avian or birdlike creature, including [[giant eagle]]s, [[giant owl]]s, [[griffin]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, or even [[owlbear]]s. They could also transform into the last creature they had a telepathic link with.\n\nIn their natural form, they had a hypnotic song that hypnotized creatures within {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} of it with its captivating sound.\n\nAfter hypnotizing a creature with its song, it would use its memory-snatching gaze to look a creature in the eye and create a telepathic link. Once linked, looking away would not free a victim from the link. Each round a victim spent with this link, the wilora could telepathically ask one question, which the victim must answer to the best of its ability, instantly transferring the full answer directly into the wilora's mind. The wilora could only use this ability on one creature at a time and must concentrate as with a spell. A creature that had freed itself from the wilora's telepathic link was safe from the ability for 24 hours.\n\nThe wilora was resistant to all [[enchantment]] spells and effects.",
        "Personality": "They were cunning and deceptive creatures, normally pretending to be only local birds. They enjoyed choosing targets from whom they could take amusing, humiliating, or hedonistic memories. Sought out for their talents, they were often befriended by thieves' guilds to get information from prisoners and city officials, gain alibis, and blackmail wealthy or powerful targets. If the relationship got rocky, wiloras were known to expose and destroy the guild by giving away their criminal activities.",
        "Combat": "At night, wiloras took advantage of their alternate forms to defend themselves or to make an escape, but often trusted their assumed forms to adequately defend themselves. If caught during the day, they would rely heavily on their hypnotic song to escape.",
        "Society": "They were mostly solitary creatures.",
        "History": "It was believed they were creations of [[Beshaba]], formed by soaking the eggs of some tropical bird in the blood of a [[doppelganger]]. This was strongly assumed to be truth as wiloras had some many similarities to doppelgangers. Wiloras were introduced into [[Waterdeep]] by the [[Unseen]]."
