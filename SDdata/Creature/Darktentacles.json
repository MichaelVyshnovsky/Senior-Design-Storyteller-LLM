        "mainbody": "'''Darktentacles''' were evil, multi-tentacled [[aberration]]s.",
        "Description": "Darktentacles were amphibious predators that resembled a writhing mass of black, leathery tentacles. A fully grown darktentacles was typically the size of a [[cow]], but its amorphous body allowed it to flatten itself to cover a large area. Darktentacles could grow up to fifty tentacles, though usually only a maximum of thirty-six were fully developed. They were typically between 7 to 15 feet (2.1 to 4.6 meters) in length, though individual specimens were reported to be as long as 20 feet (6.1 meters).\n\nTheir tentacles were covered in shielded eyes and tiny sensory nodes, making them highly perceptive. Darktentacles had infravision up to 140 feet (43 meters), including 70 feet (21 meters) underwater. They were able to sense vibrations, detect substances in water, and discern light and color differences. Each darktentacles had three beak-like mouths, and could mentally communicate with other creatures.\n\nThe flesh, eyes, and ichor of darktentacles were excellent material components for the [[spell]] ''[[wall of force]]''.",
        "Personality": "They were intelligent, carnivorous predators who preferred to drown or otherwise kill their prey before ingesting. They primarily subsisted on [[fish]] and [[bird]]s, as well as other creatures they could reach from their aquatic habitats.\n\nDarktentacles seemed to have no need of sleep, and had an uncanny ability to remember individuals who escaped them in the past.",
        "Combat": "Darktentacles fought primarily by using their tentacles to grasp victims and attempting to drown them. Each tentacle could launch a separate attack, allowing a single darktentacles to fight several foes simultaneously. If they managed to immobilize a victim using at least four tentacles, darktentacles had the innate ability to charm using their tentacle-eyes, similar in function to a ''[[charm monster]]'' spell. Charmed creatures were typically used as slaves, aiding in combat and with luring food to their master. Using the same procedure, darktentacles could also magically immobilize creatures, similar to a ''[[hold monster]]'' spell.\n\nThey were capable of creating a ''[[sphere of force]]'' roughly once every week, generating an impassable sphere up to 60 feet (18 meters) in radius. Darktentacles used this ability to trap prey, or isolate stronger foes to allow themselves to escape or postpone a confrontation. They could create a ''sphere'' as far as 90 feet (27 meters) away.\n\nDarktentacles could wield most items, including weapons taken from foes during combat, but struggled to operate delicate mechanisms.",
        "History": "Darktentacles were originally found in jungles, where they were occasionally worshiped by primitive beings. Owing to their rarity, virtually no literature on darktentacles was available outside of the [[Guild of Naturalists]] as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR.\n\nShortly after the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], agents of the [[Harpers]] reported increased sightings of darktentacles in the [[North]]. Three individuals were spotted in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] alone, with other sightings in the marshes of [[Calimshan]] and [[Cormyr]].\n\nDarktentacles were also prevalent in the [[Spider Swamp]] of [[Calimshan]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Although they preferred areas with warm, still water, darktentacles could also survive in colder climates and more tumultuous waters.",
            "Relationships": "Darktentacles often acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deity]] [[Shar]]."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "The Guild of Naturalists speculated that darktentacles were a cross-breed of [[roper]]s and [[trapper]]s.\n\nDarktentacles were believed to have grown in power, at least temporarily, following the Time of Troubles. This was due to post-Godswar sightings conflicting with reports on darktentacles from the Guild of Naturalists. The Guild reports described a significantly weaker creature; the only darktentacles found to conform to that description was found in a [[dead-magic zone]]."
