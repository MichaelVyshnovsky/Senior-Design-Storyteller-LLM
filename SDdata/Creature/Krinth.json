        "Description": {
            "Physiology": "Krinth children matured more quickly than did humans, but they reached adulthood around 20 years of age and lived to be between 100 and 125 years old.",
            "Personality": "A krinth was typically grumpy and humorless, with a short temper. They worked hard at everything they did, whether a job or play, setting their minds to complete any given task. Despite being dedicated in duty, they otherwise were very chaotic in their mindsets. Because of their demonic heritage, they were often evil-hearted, especially among those krinth still living among the Shadovar.",
            "Abilities": "Krinth had no inherent magical qualities or powers, but their familiarity with the Plane of Shadow made them resistant to spells and effects that involved shadows. They were rumored to be nearly without fear, except for feelings of agoraphobia from large open spaces."
        },
        "Combat": "A typical krinth [[warrior]] of the [[Shadovar]] was clad in a blackened breastplate and carried a finely crafted [[ranseur]] with a [[short sword]] at his side.\n\n[[File:Krinth.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''A krinth attacking.'']]\nKrinth preferred to set up ambushes and strike by cover of darkness. Once the battle was underway, they tended to rely on the orders of their masters. If no one was available to give commands, they usually simply focused on the most obvious opponent and engaged in melee. Regardless of who they were fighting or how well they were faring, they fought without fear.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "All krinth could speak [[Common]]. Many who lived with the Shadovar also spoke [[Netherese language|Netherese]]. Even though they often knew the demons who brought them into being, they rarely learned to speak [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]]. Krinth generally knew how to read and write.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note\" />",
            "Magic and Religion": "The only way a krinth would become a mage would be if he or she found a secret teacher.\n\nThe divine powers most often revered by the krinth included some of the [[demon lord]]s or the gods [[Bane]] (among the Zhentarim), [[Laduguer]] or [[Lolth]] (among the drow), or [[Shar]]. A krinth would only very rarely worship the demon who sired him or her."
        },
        "History": "During the time that the [[City of Shade]] resided in the Plane of Shadow, its arcanists often fraternized with shadow demons. Sometimes, these demons were curious about the matter of sexual pleasure, and from the unions of [[Netherese]] and [[demon]], the first krinth were born. These original demonborn krinth were considered special, a curious sign of the new relationship between the beings of the Shadow and Material Planes. However, over time, demons would also rape slaves, producing further demonspawn krinth, and thus krinth ceased being a novelty and were reduced in status. The only reason the krinth were treated better than other humanoid slaves was that the Shadovar feared the demons wrath if they mistreated their offspring. In truth, the demons had no love for the krinth at all. \n\nBecause of [[Shar]]'s secret manipulations, sometime in the latter half of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], the demonspawn krinth became fertile, giving rise to the first generation of trueborn krinth. Shar hoped that the krinth would give her an advantage over her sister [[Selûne]], and since the return of the City of Shade to [[Faerûn]], she has been tying to get more and more of them to escape so that they might spread across the world as her servants.\n\nFor their part, the krinth denied this tale of their origins. They believed that they were a race natural to the Plane of Shadow and that they were sold as slaves to the Netherese in return for treasure and knowledge from the [[Prime Material Plane]].\n\nWhatever the truth, the krinth began a sharp decline after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]]. As their numbers dwindled while those of the newly \"born\" [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] increased, some scholars among the Netherese speculated that those events where related, and that somehow the shadar-kai were evolved forms of the failed krinth.{{Cite dragon/391/A Legacy in Shadow|14}}"
