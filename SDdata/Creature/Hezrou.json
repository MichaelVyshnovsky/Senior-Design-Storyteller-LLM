        "mainbody": "Hezrous ( ), or type II demons,\nHezrous were large demonic monstrosities that stood  tall and weighed . They bore a superficial resemblance to a toad in humanoid form, with arms and hands instead of forelegs. Within their wide maws were rows of blunt teeth that had a powerful crushing force, and a series of long spikes ran down their backs. Hezrous could walk on either two feet or on hands and feet, but always fought standing upright.\nHezrous were obedient and simple, yet dangerously powerful beings, and as such were among the dominant monsters within the Abyss. A hezrous main motivating factor was food, followed by a desire for wanton destruction. They gladly served under more powerful demons or even summoners who supported their behavior. Their love of combat surpassed that of vrocks and the two possessed similar eating habits.\nDespite their love for fighting, hezrous were not opposed to diplomacy, even with mortals, and might engage in trade when carrying cargo such as slaves. Hezrous were not particularly intelligent, intuitive, or otherwise mentally capable, a fact that was seen as a virtue by their masters as scheming was not their job, Unfortunately for those under their thumb, hezrous were still demons through and through, beating up on even loyal subordinates for fun and just being generally foul-tempered.\nA hezrous amphibian skin exuded a toxic substance that produced a cloud of noxious gas when they were agitated while their own olfactory senses were quite sharp. They were somewhat ineffective against non-demonic beings, as many of their abilities didnt work against evil outsiders. They had access to many spell-like abilities, including blasphemy, unholy blight, and chaos hammer.\nthumb|right|250px|A hezrou fighting off adventurers.\nHezrous were cunning on the battlefield and could fulfill roles as both powerful warriors and capable sergeants. \nWhen against non-evil entities, hezrous opened combat by casting blasphemy, and then favored chaos hammer or unholy blight from time to time as suited their foes. Against enemy armies, they attempted to punch holes in the opposing line with unholy blight or chaos hammer, gladly forcing their way into and behind enemy ranks. There, a hezrous foul stench could overwhelm as many (and as early) as possible, and they would be free to rip into their opponents with tooth and claw, although they might accidentally take out an allied, low-ranking fiend in their wild rampage.\nthumb|left|250px|A hezrou slaver whipping various fiends into line.\nHezrous were integral to both the Blood War and the day-to-day proceedings of the Abyss in general. At their core, hezrous functioned as enforcers, either as sturdy foot soldiers or solid sergeants.\nGiven that they were seen as somewhat expendable and normally werent smart enough themselves to realize when they were being duped into sacrificing themselves, hezrous often sought to make themselves useful to their masters so as to ensure they were not sent into unwinnable front-line situations. They were often spared from this duty of certain death.\nDespite not being particularly good at scheming, hezrous still made use of temptation, making simple but cruel deals to those in states of despair. Every now and then in a century, hezrous went on what were called Dark Walks, plane-shifting to the mortal realm to make pacts with desperate souls. They would willingly enter their service and complete a major task like the destruction of a hated location or retrieval of a powerful artifact at the cost of trapping the mortal or a loved one in the Abyss and having them serve as a mane for eternity. Otherwise, when on the Material Plane they recruited dull-witted followers in trolls, hill giants, ogres, and other creatures known for their power.\nIt was possible for a marilith to be demoted to a hezrou as a punishment, bringing a change in sex from female to male.\nThe Faceless Lord Juiblex was served primarily by hezrous who paid him significant fealty in victims. In fact, his primary servant, Darkness Given Hunger, was actually a hezrou demon whose possession of the largest known black pudding had been made permanent through magic, fusing the two together.\nDemogorgon also employed many hezrous as lieutenants, although his were twice the size of any others within the Abyss.\nHezrous had a kind of half-organic armor plating under their flesh, an ancient alteration made by the sibriexes.\nThe hezrou Zaxis was actually a fallen marilith named Bethsiva, whose child was the balor Baalbisan with a rank even higher than hers."
