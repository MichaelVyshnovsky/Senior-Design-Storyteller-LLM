Scum creepers were a strange, uncommon species of slug-like creatures.
On average a scum creeper grew to be  in diameter and  in length. They had fat, slimy bodies similar to slugs that were largely grey in color, with sickly white underbellies and pale yellow heads. However, they had a myriad of tiny hooked legs and suctioning segments on their underbelly that allowed them to freely crawl along walls and ceilings. Much like a leech, on the lower portion of their head was a small sucker-like mouth full of sharp, shearing plates of hornlike substance.
Much like leeches, these creatures used their mouths to fasten themselves to their prey and eat away at them until either they or their prey was dead.
In 1357 DR, scum creepers could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep.
The eyes on these creatures were only vestigial. They had sensory organs located in a cluster of cilia at their head. Finally, in a similar manner to both slugs and leeches, the soft flesh of a scum creeper was highly vulnerable to rock salt.
Scum creepers were an omnivorous species, willing to eat just about anything. They were primarily known to feed upon plant growth, but would also eat rotting cloth, wood, and flesh.
Scum creepers were typically found underground and in dismal swamps where the suns rays barely broke through.
Beyond Toril, these creatures were commonly found on Illithid homeworlds.
