Additionally, they could inflict baneful doses of necrotic energy upon living creatures they touched. And if destroyed, their bodies would violently explode, sending out shards of stone and a burst of necrotic energy. \nMuch like a standard stone golem, these constructs relied heavily upon their fists to harm the opposition.\nOn average, building a tombstone golem required the spell slay living and around approximately 70,000 gold pieces.\nAround , a group of adventurers traveled through a portal beneath the city of Myth Drannor, taking them into Shazryls tower in the Shadowfell. There they encountered a great number of creatures under the alhoons command, including a trio of forsaken shells that guarded a room alongside a tombstone golem."
