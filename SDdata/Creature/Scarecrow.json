        "Description": "Typical scarecrows were constructed from a stuffed sackcloth roughly shaped like a [[humanoid]], then animated through binding with an evil spirit. Any creature could provide its spirit to animate a scarecrow, but different creators had different preferences. [[Hag]]s and [[witch]]es, for example, tended to prefer the spirits of [[demon]]s.",
        "Personality": "Scarecrows were stalwart defenders of their creators. They had an unwavering allegiance to them, following their commands even long after their masters' deaths. Some scarecrows were loyal to the point of even seeking revenge for a slain master.\n\nThe spirit bound to a scarecrow could retain some traces of its former personality, but it did not carry any of its memories.",
        "Combat": "The unnerving sight of a scarecrow alone could terrify its victim to the point of paralysis. They were expert fighters with their [[razor]]-sharp claws, which were particularly effective against paralyzed targets.\n\nDue to their construction, scarecrows were resistant against most ordinary weapons, but were particularly vulnerable to [[fire]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], scarecrows terrorized a few outlying farms in the [[Undercliff]] ward of [[Waterdeep]]."
