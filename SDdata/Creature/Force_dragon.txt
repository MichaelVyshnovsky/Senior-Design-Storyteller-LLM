Force dragons were extremely powerful, arrogant, and aloof dragons.
Newly hatched force dragons had translucent scales that resembled shimmering diamonds. As they aged, their innate manipulation of force made them harder and harder to see, until, at the peak of their power, they became completely invisible.
Force dragons were completely odorless.
In general, force dragons did not have any interest in talking to other races, judging all of them inferior to their own. The only other races respected by force dragons were prismatic dragons and some deities.
It was rare for force dragons to provoke a combat, but they defended their territories with relentless fury until every trespasser was killed or driven away. Their natural ability to manipulate force made it easy for them to deflect incoming attacks, so they were extremely hard to hit, with their natural scales nearly impenetrable.
Their breath weapon consisted of a devastating cone of force.
Force dragons could be found in the Dragon Eyrie.
The horns of a force dragon of at least adult age could be used to provide the magical energy for a staff of power.
