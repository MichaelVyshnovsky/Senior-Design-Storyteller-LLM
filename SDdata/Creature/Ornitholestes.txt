Ornitholestes () was a species of dinosaur.
Ornitholestes were lightweight dinosaurs about the size of a tall humanoid.
Ornitholestes moved very rapidly, making it quite difficult to hit.
Ornitholestes were most often encountered in plains. 
Ornitholestes were carnivorous and lived, and hunted, in packs. Their diet consisted mainly of eggs and insects, although they have been known to hunt larger prey if hungry enough.
