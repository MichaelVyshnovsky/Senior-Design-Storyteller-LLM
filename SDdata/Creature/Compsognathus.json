They attacked as an ambush and preferred to attack prey while it was sleeping.\nCompsognathus were carnivores and lived in packs. Their typical diet consisted of lizards and insects.\nCompsognathus lived along the River Soshenstar, and although they didnt pose a threat, their harassment of the citizens of Port Nyanzaru led to the development of a barbed metal wire known as compy wire.\nCompsognathus were valued as familiars for their highly developed sight, and they could be summoned using a find familiar spell."
