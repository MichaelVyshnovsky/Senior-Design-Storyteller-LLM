        "mainbody": "'''Elemental vermin''' were small natives of the [[elemental planes]] but could also be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.\n\nThey were simple pests on their native elemental planes, but carried the potential for wreaking havoc in Zakhara.",
        "Description": "There were four varieties of elemental vermin, one for each of the four primary elements:\n\n* [[Duster]]s ([[Air]])\n* [[Crawler]]s ([[Earth (element)|Earth]])\n* [[Flameling]]s ([[Fire]])\n* [[Spitter]]s ([[Water]])",
        "Habitat": "These creatures entered Zakhara through magical [[gate]]s. They were always found in areas that presented high concentrations of their native element or areas where [[genie]]s and [[elemental]]s were more common.\n\nThey could often be found lurking around the dock areas and warehouses of [[Huzuz]].",
        "Ecology": "Elemental vermin were scavengers on their home planes. However, within Zakhara they consumed things that were prized by civilized society including [[perfume]], [[gem]]s, [[silk]], and [[wine]]."
