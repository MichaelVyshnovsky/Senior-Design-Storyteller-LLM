        "mainbody": "The tamhi were two Malatran offshoots of the spirit folk of Kara-Tur. They were distinguished as being either jungle tamhi or river tamhi, similar in nature to the bamboo and river spirit folk respectively.\nAll tamhi had thin and supple bodies, with narrow eyes and extremely thin eyebrows. On average they stood  tall and weighed around .\nThe jungle tamhi had bronzed skin with black eyes, while the river tamhi had pale skin with almond colored eyes, but the skin of both had a tint of gold to it. Both genders of each type were incapable of growing facial hair. Both types of tamhi had hair colors ranging from light brown, black, and blond, with blond being the most rare and considered by them to be sacred.\nSimple dress was preferred by the tamhi and only the necessities to survive away from ones clan were carried around.\nThe two types of tamhi were quite intelligent and fierce defenders of their respective habitat. They also shared a deep fear of fire, typically fleeing when presented with it.\nMuch like other spirit folk the tamhi were highly attuned to nature and their surroundings, capable of drawing upon their nature spirit ancestry. Both types had infravision out to  and were more susceptible to fire-based spells and abilities.\nJungle tamhi were skilled at hiding in the shadows of the jungle and had some resistance to earth and wood-based spells and abilities. Once per day they could speak with animals and speak with plants. They could travel throughout the jungle without leaving a trace.\nRiver tamhi were adept at swimming and could breathe underwater. Once per day they could immerse themselves in a fresh water river or stream and be healed in a manner similar to cure serious wounds.\nTamhi of both types were typically warriors, though one could also find rogues and wizards among them, the latter of whom had to travel to other tribes to find a teacher in magic.\nAll tamhi had a strong sense of family. They lived in clans that were composed of a collection of families related through several marriages.\nThe tamhi were an omnivorous people, though they typically preferred to be vegetarians. They had no taste for fermented berries or other strong drinks, often falling ill from their consumption.\nThroughout their existence on the Malatra Plateau, the jungle and river tamhi held excellent relations with one another, having never once went to war. They sometimes forged alliances with the Nubari, who viewed them as attractive and mystical, to protect their habitat.\nIt was incredibly rare to find tamhi living within non-tamhi tribes, The Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba lacked tamhi members, though they often visited it.\nThe jungle tamhi and black leopard variety of katanga held a mutual hatred for one another and were sometimes being mistaken for the other.\nThe origins of the tamhi were shrouded in mystery.\nTamhi would be witnesses to the destruction of the once verdant Yaku Plains\nWhen a member of the ancients began experimenting with old forbidden magic, the same magic that had created the Yaku Plains, plantmen and hundreds of tamhi confronted the ancients ruling council. Demanding they put a stop to that individual ancients use of forbidden magic."
