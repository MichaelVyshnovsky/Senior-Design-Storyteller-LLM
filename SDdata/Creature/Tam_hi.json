        "mainbody": "The '''tam'hi''' were two [[Malatran Plateau|Malatran]] offshoots of the [[spirit folk]] of [[Kara-Tur]]. They were distinguished as being either '''jungle tam'hi''' or '''river tam'hi''', similar in nature to the [[bamboo spirit folk|bamboo]] and [[river spirit folk|river]] spirit folk respectively.",
        "Description": "All tam'hi had thin and supple bodies, with narrow eyes and extremely thin eyebrows. On average they stood {{SIrange|4.2|4.6|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SIrange|70|90|lb|k|long=yes}}.\n\nThe jungle tam'hi had bronzed skin with black eyes, while the river tam'hi had pale skin with almond colored eyes, but the skin of both had a tint of gold to it. Both genders of each type were incapable of growing facial hair. Both types of tam'hi had hair colors ranging from light brown, black, and blond, with blond being the most rare and considered by them to be sacred.\n\nSimple dress was preferred by the tam'hi and only the necessities to survive away from one's clan were carried around.",
        "Personality": "The two types of tam'hi were quite intelligent and fierce defenders of their respective habitat. They also shared a deep fear of fire, typically fleeing when presented with it.",
        "Abilities": "Much like other spirit folk the tam'hi were highly attuned to nature and their surroundings, capable of drawing upon their [[spirit|nature spirit]] ancestry. Both types had [[infravision]] out to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} and were more susceptible to [[fire]]-based [[spell]]s and abilities.\n\nJungle tam'hi were skilled at hiding in the shadows of the jungle and had some resistance to [[Earth (element)|earth]] and [[wood]]-based spells and abilities. Once per day they could ''[[speak with animals]]'' and ''[[speak with plants]]''. They could travel throughout the jungle [[pass without trace|without leaving a trace]].\n\nRiver tam'hi were adept at swimming and could breathe underwater. Once per day they could immerse themselves in a fresh water river or stream and be healed in a manner similar to ''[[cure serious wounds]]''.",
        "Combat": "Tam'hi of both types were typically [[warrior]]s, though one could also find [[rogue]]s and [[wizard]]s among them, the latter of whom had to travel to other tribes to find a teacher in [[magic]].",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "The tam'hi were an omnivorous people, though they typically preferred to be vegetarians. They had no taste for fermented berries or other strong drinks, often falling ill from their consumption.",
            "Relationships": "Throughout their existence on the Malatra Plateau, the jungle and river tam'hi held excellent relations with one another, having never once went to war. They sometimes forged alliances with the [[Nubari]], who viewed them as attractive and mystical, to protect their habitat.\n\nIt was incredibly rare to find tam'hi living within non-tam'hi tribes,{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|11}} The [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]] lacked tam'hi members, though they often visited it.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|9}}\n\nThe jungle tam'hi and black leopard variety of [[katanga]] held a mutual hatred for one another and were sometimes being mistaken for the other."
        },
        "History": "The origins of the tam'hi were shrouded in mystery.{{Cite web/RPGA Living Jungle/Jungle Tales 11}}\n\nTam'hi would be witnesses to the destruction of the once verdant [[Yaku Plains]]{{Cite polyhedron/102/The Living Jungle|7}}\n\nWhen a member of the ancients began experimenting with old forbidden magic, the same magic that had created the Yaku Plains, plantmen and hundreds of tam'hi confronted the ancients' ruling council. Demanding they put a stop to that individual ancient's use of forbidden magic."
