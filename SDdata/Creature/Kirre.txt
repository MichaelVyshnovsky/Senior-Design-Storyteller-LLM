'''Kirre''' were large vicious [[psionics|psionically-gifted]] carnivorous beasts from the world of [[Athas]].

==Description==
An average kirre was {{SI|8'|'"|long=yes}} long great cat. Their coat resembled that of a [[tiger]], colored in brown and gray stripes, leaving face covered just in dark gray fur. The dark coat accentuated their bright yellow eyes, creating a spine-chilling look. However, kirre's most notable features were their eight legs, horns on both sides of the head, and a barbed tail. Like other cats, they had sharp claws and maws filled with razor teeth to rip their prey apart. Some kirre had more [[lion]]ine features 

==Abilities==
Kirre's natural upperhand against many other creatures were their psionic abilities. They were able to ''[[project force]]'', use ''[[psionic blast]]s'', and ''[[psychic crush|psychically crush]]'' their opponents. Kirre posessed the ability to ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[life detection|detect living creatures]]'', and establish a telepathic ''[[contact]]'' with other beings. Additionally, kirre's defensive psionics were always active, granting them protections of the ''[[tower of iron will]]'', ''[[thought shield]]'', and ''[[intellect fortress]]''.

==Behavior==

Kirre were known for their cunning and patience, and both flew out the window when the beast was starving. They were smart enough to assess danger and their prey's weapons and armor. They were known to use different tactics to deal with different marks. Sometimes kirre used their fearsome roars to scare the prey ahead of an attack, while other times, the cats kept hidden until an opportunity arose to deal the most damage with the first pounce.

==Combat==
Kierre were born predators and were swift and deadly when faced in combat. They could move with great speed, greatly surpassing the speed of other creatures of their size. Due to their speed, kierre could rend their opponents with claws, teeth, and tail barb as much as seven times per six seconds. They usually attacked first with their front paws, followed by a bite, and a horn stab, then they continued ripping their targets apart with middle and hind paws, and finally, stabbed with the tail barb. Instead of physical attacks, they could also utilize their impressive psionic powers.

==Ecology==

Kirre were solitary hunters who gathered in packs during the mating season. A male and female then coupled up to produce and raize their young. Each litter was from three to five kittens. Mammalian creatures, female kirre lactated, feed the kittens five months after their birth. After five months, kirre young began feeding on meat, usually small forest animals. During the five months that followed procreation, both parents aggressively defended their lair, slaying anything that came too close.

Kirre were game beasts, targets for ambitious hunters. The great cats were killed for their great-quality meat, their horns that could be made into deadly [[spear]]s or intricately carved [[dagger]]s (each horn was valued at 25 [[gold]] pieces), tail baarbs could be fashioned into [[arrowhead]]s or [[dart]]s, while their hides could be made into masterwork [[Hide armor|armor]].<ref>{{Cite book| author = Richard Baker, Robert J.

==History==
On their homeworld, kirre were believed to have evolved from Athasian great cats of the planet's distant past. By the late-14{{th}} [[DR]], kirre were believed to have been brought to [[Toril]] from the world of Athas and inhabited the [[Cloven Mountains]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].
