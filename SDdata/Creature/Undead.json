        "mainbody": "There were six basic ways a living creature could become undead:\n;Purposeful personal reanimation:\n: A living creature could willingly undergo the transformation to undeath. In most cases, the creature possessed a disposition towards [[evil]], but this was not always the case. More common reasons included fear of dying of old age, fear of dying from a grievous wound, and a thirst for power.\n;Minions:\n: An intelligent creature might create undead servants as a means to their own ends. These mindless minions were created by malevolent [[spellcaster]]s to serve as guards or otherwise carry out their bidding.\n;Atrocity calls to unlife:\n: Sometimes, a living creature committed an evil and heinous act that transformed them into an undead creature. The intensity and specificity of the required act was somewhat random and not entirely uncommon.\n;Unfinished business:\n: An intelligent creature died or was killed with an important deed left incomplete. In a similar manner to atrocities, the specifications surrounding undeath achieved in this manner were often left up to chance.\n;Dark forces:\n: Malign forces created undead beings seemingly at random. This had the potential to befall any creature, at any location and seemingly at any time. In [[Cormyr]], it was thought that wandering evil spirits would take over corpses and use them to slay and scare the living.\n;Death by wounds caused by another undead:\n: Many forms of undead creatures inflicted their undeath upon others when striking them with a mortal wound. Perhaps most famously, this occurred in the case of [[vampire]]s and their bite.<ref>",
