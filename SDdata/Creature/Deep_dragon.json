        "mainbody": "'''Deep dragons''', also called '''purple dragons''', '''drakes of the depths''', were a type of [[chromatic dragon]] that lived in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "Despite their large size, deep dragons were slender and agile, and their snakelike bodies, narrow wings, and thin limbs allowed them to crawl through the tunnels of the Underdark. and in the light, an adult dragon's scales were the color of amethyst, while in the dark, they appeared nearly black. In general, older specimens had much darker scales, while younger ones had more purple or maroon coloration.\n\nA dragon egg could be identified as that of a deep dragon by the purple tinge seen when held in front of an intense white light, though it shared this trait with [[shadow dragon]] and [[amethyst dragon]] eggs.<ref>",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|Uncover every last stone!|Deep dragon saying\n}}\n\n\nDeep dragons were patient and cunning. They preferred to manipulate and negotiate rather than to risk combat, and were crafty dealmakers. They were quick to disregard any creature that wasn't useful to them. \n\nDeep dragons collected trivia, insights, tricks, and knowledge from far flung places, and delighted in acquiring new information.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Phazeuroth.jpg|thumb|left|''A deep dragon lurks among the stalactites.'']]In order to better allow them to navigate the narrow underground tunnels which they called home, deep dragons developed potent innate magical powers, including the ability to [[transmute rock to mud]], and to cast spells like ''[[passwall]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', and ''[[stone shape]]''.\n\nPerhaps their most distinctive ability was their unique [[Shapechange|shapechanging]] power which developed as they aged. The first form they learned to adopt was that of a [[winged snake]], which did not reduce their overall size but allowed them to slither and fly unimpeded by extra limbs. The second form they learned to adopt was that of a normal [[humanoid]], and they could alter this form's appearance as with a ''[[polymorph self]]'' spell.\n\nDeep dragons were incapable of becoming intoxicated.",
        "Combat": "The claws of a deep dragon were intended to dig through solid rock, and as such, were devastating in combat even against heavily [[armor]]ed enemies. They preferred to pick off their enemies strategically, stalking them in the dark before pouncing or triggering a rockfall to bury them.\n\nA deep dragon's breath weapon attacked creatures' minds, and caused the target to be dazed or [[dominate person|dominated]], depending on the strength of the wyrm. These effects were attributed to fungal spores that the dragon exhaled. They were also known to be able to breath a cone of gas that was caustic to flesh.\n\nDeep dragons were harmed by direct [[sunlight]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Deep dragons preferred \"seafood\" including [[clam]]s, [[fish]], [[kuo-toa]], and even [[aboleth]]s. That said, they were known to eat nearly anything, and it was not uncommon for Underdark societies to trade with a deep dragon by offering them food in the form of [[humanoid]] prisoners.",
            "Uses": "The claw of a deep dragon could be used as a special component in the casting of the ''[[dragon blight]]'' spell. Their scales were also highly-prized by drow wizards, used in the formation of their [[everdark ink]]."
        },
        "Society": "Deep dragons valued and hoarded knowledge, and preferred to collect unique treasures with interesting backstories. They would meticulously organize their hoards, even framing or displaying their favorite pieces, and they delighted in giving long tours to guests, particularly other deep dragons. \n\nWhile some actively avoided revealing themselves to other types of [[dragon]]s, most enjoyed their company. Deep dragons tended to look down on \"inferior\" creatures, but could be encountered near drow cities working as guardians for the drow, expecting to be paid for their services with a steady supply of food in the form of captives and criminals.\n\nThey were not above working with non-dragons, but treated them either as servants or subordinates. They were enemies to [[mind flayer]]s and [[cloaker]]s,",
