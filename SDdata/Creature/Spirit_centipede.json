        "mainbody": "'''Spirit centipedes''' were a race of poisonous shapeshifters native to [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "A giant centipede with a segmented body, the distinguishing feature of the spirit centipede was its head. It had a [[human]] face, bald head, large mustache, and nine eyes distributed around the head. A spirit centipede's shell was multi-colored, with alternating segments of green, scarlet, and silver.",
        "Combat": "The spirit centipede's shell protected it from attacks. It defended itself by biting or stinging an opponent. Its sting was poisonous. As its primary weapon, it coughed up a thick, black cloud of fog that could reach 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. This fog cloud blocked all sight including [[darkvision]].",
        "Abilities": "All spirit centipedes were shapeshifters. A greater spirit centipede could shapeshift into five forms, a lesser spirit centipede into three forms, and the least spirit centipede into two forms. The forms they could shapeshift into were:\n* Centipede\n* Scorpion\n* Snake\n* Spider\n* Toad",
        "Society": "Spirit centipedes were used by the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] to administer punishment to heretics.",
        "Ecology": "A spirit centipede's diet included most inorganic objects, but they favored minerals. If they willingly gave an individual one of its scales, it could be used as a charm of ''[[protection against disease]]''. A dead least spirit centipede's body turned into brass, and was often used as a charm of ''[[protection against spirits]]'' in buildings across Kara-Tur."
