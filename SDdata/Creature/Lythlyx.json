        "mainbody": "Lythlyx (), also known as spirals, were bizarre psionic eel-like monsters that resembled corkscrews. Whether in the air or in water, they were constantly spinning.\nThe rubbery and oily creatures were mottled black and green, with numerous mouths along their length. They spun constantly in midair, sometimes as fast as fifty revolutions per minute.\nThough intelligent, they remained uncommunicative and extremely unpredictable, sometimes passing up easy prey for larger groups or larger and more dangerous creatures. One thing remained constant whether in the water or in air they did not touch the ground by choice, and thrashed violently if made to touch it. They did not use their psionic powers unless another originator of such powers acted near them, or they became dangerously wounded.\nLythlyx usually danced in place for years at a time, being found in remote areas. They seemed to favor cairns atop hills, rocky islets, and secluded pools in forested areas. Those that were found alone were always the strongest specimens, but otherwise they were found in groups of up to eighteen.\nSo long as they remained spinning, lythlyx were not just mobile, but extremely agile, being able to turn pretty much at will. If they were ever stopped from spinning, they dropped to the ground their great air resistance minimized damage from the fall, however.\nThe creatures seemed unaffected by pressure extremes, whether in deep trenches or in the stratosphere. Lacking eyes, they saw out of several similar structures along their bodies.\nThey possessed extensive psionic abilities, being known to use the psychokinetic science of create object, and the devotions of animate object, control flame, control sound, create sound, and molecular agitation. They were known to sport the psychometabolism devotions of body equilibrium and suspend animation. Though uncommunicative, they had a wide suite of telepathic powers, including the psychic crush science, and the devotions of id insinuation, mind thrust, psionic blast, and telepathic projection. Finally, and of more note, their psychoportation abilities included the sciences of summon planar creature and teleport, alongside the teleport trigger devotion those could carry them from danger if severely wounded.\nthumb|left|250px|A warrior brandishing his weapon against a lythlyx.\nThose the creature attacked, apparently at random, were seized by mouth-like structures along its length that drained blood. The creature was extremely voracious and could process that blood to heal itself within two minutes, at which point it was hungry again. Its avidity for blood was such that they often exploded from the sheer volume of blood they had absorbed if struck down during feeding. It could also use its body as a whip or to constrict. It was also possessed of some psychic power, displaying immunities to spells such as charm monster, hold monster, sleep, command, and fear.\nThey fled more powerful foes, but fought to the death when cornered.\nLythlyx absorbed sunlight and moisture through their bodies, doing without blood for long stretches. They appeared to be hermaphroditic,\"Bisexual\" in the text this is an older usage of the term. giving live birth to young that swarmed with the parent until fully grown. They were believed to live for centuries some sages hypothesized they were part of the life cycle of the couatl or certain dragons, while others believed them to be a stage in the life cycle of other tentacled monsters such as tentamorts, gibbering mouthers, or ropers. Their oily flesh was eaten only as a last resort by their predators.\nTheir body oil was used in the manufacture of several magical inks and oils.\nBy the , lythlyx were known to wander Myth Drannor. One may have been at Sixstar, ready to meet the heroes seeking the Arm of Valor.\nMysteriously, some of those creatures served Labelas Enoreth."
