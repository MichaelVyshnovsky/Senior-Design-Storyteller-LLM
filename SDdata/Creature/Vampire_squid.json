        "mainbody": "Vampire squid were a species of large aquatic predators.\nVampire squids were large squid, growing up to  in length. Instead of a beak, they had a large mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth. The end of its body was covered in a hard shell.\nVampire squids had excellent vision, capable of seeing a target up to  away through pitch-black water. They were proficient swimmers, and had the ability to swim rapidly in short bursts.\nSince its tentacles were not strong enough to constrict its prey, a vampire squid used them to wrap a target and drag it in reach of its mouth. Vampire squids were ambush predators. To defend itself, a vampire squid inverted its mouth, exposing its sharp teeth. Its mouth was large enough to envelope most of its body, giving it a natural armor covered in its teeth.\nVampire squids were not natural, instead they were created by mind flayers. Their purpose was to serve, extending the influence of their masters to the underwater domains of the Underdark.\nVampire squid were voracious carnivores, eating several hundred pounds of fish, insects and shellfish per day. They were solitary creatures for this reason, as two or more vampire squid inhabiting the same body of water would consume all the prey in a matter of weeks. The only time they gathered was to either mate or were summoned by a mind flayer."
