        "mainbody": "A wraith was an undead creature born of evil and darkness, despising light and all living things.\nWraiths were powerless in natural sunlight, appearing as a sinister, spectral figure robed in darkness. They had no visual features or appendages, except for their glowing red eyes.\nThey could drain the life from living creatures, turning them into new wraiths upon death.\nWraiths became far weaker when under the exposure of full sunlight.\nLike many undead, wraiths possessed a chilling touch. However, these beings were most similar in nature to the undead known as wights. Both could drain creatures of their life energy and could only be harmed by either silver or enchanted weaponry.\nIn 1479 DR, wraiths, moon wraiths, and wisp wraiths  could be found in the company of Shadovar.\nMoon Wraiths\nA crescent-shaped wraith that arose from lycanthropes who had died while in the midst of transforming. They used hit-and-run tactics, flying through their enemies in a crescent arc as often as they could.\nWisp Wraiths\nA type of wraith that resulted from humanoids killed by a wraith failing to form correctly into a true wraith. These were weaker than other types of wraith. They typically crowded around their opponents, using their necrotic powers to slow them down.\nThough they could be found on the Prime Material plane, wraiths were far more prominent in the Negative Energy plane. They were typically encountered in places that were dark and gloomy, away from the debilitating rays of the sun.\nBeing a type of undead connected to Negative Energy plane, wraiths acted as servants of the deities Jergal, Kiaransalee, and the Chultan demigod Eshowdow.\nSome were known to use the dust left behind by destroyed wraiths as a material component for the spell wraithform. This wraith residue was a shadowy ichor, sometimes used in creation of magic items, and sold for over 370 gold coins per a single pouch.\n* Brysis"
