        "mainbody": "A keening spirit was a type of ghost, created specifically from the spirit of an evil female elf. Known for its constant weeping and groaning, the creature was sometimes referred to as a \"groaning spirit\". A drow keening spirit was known as a \"kiaranshee\", after the drow goddess of the undead, Kiaransalee.\nAlthough a keening spirit shared many of the qualities of a ghost, its most dreaded weapon was its wail or keen. This ability functioned like the wail of the banshee spell.\nIt was typically shrouded in white light and emanated a chilling presence. Living beings often felt sick and weak in its proximity.\n* Cabrath Nelinderra A powerful kiaranshee, Cabrath was an undead priestess of Kiaransalee in ghostly form that served as the head priestess in the Acropolis of Thanatos."
