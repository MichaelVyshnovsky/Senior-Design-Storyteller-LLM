These amorphous oozes resembled a slithering mass of seething and boiling blood. Occasionally they manifested faces that were twisted in torment, which were personifications of its demonic essence and often resembled the faces of those whose blood was sacrificed to create them.
Bloodfire oozes radiated tremendous heat from their bodies and reeked of the smell of sulfur. Whenever they quickly absorbed any faces that manifested upon them, clouds of poisonous sulfuric gas would be disgorged.
These oozes were virtually mindless creatures, only dimly aware of their surroundings. Though they were motivated by evil acts and the moment they came into existence a bloodfire oozed pursued nourishment.

This sacrificial blood had to be sourced from at least a hundred good or neutrally-aligned humanoids &mdash even more depending upon the desired size of the ooze. The mixture had to be done in an enormous cauldron, inscribed with special runes, and worth at least 3,000 gold pieces. Finally, the ritual had to be done within the area of an unhallow spell and it took a total of twenty four hours to complete.

Bloodfire oozes fed upon the blood of other creatures and were especially nourished by the blood of good-aligned creatures.
