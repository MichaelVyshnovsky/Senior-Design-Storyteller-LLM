        "mainbody": "'''Lakshu''' were tall, warlike humanoids that served the [[reigar]] as warriors and crew aboard their [[esthetic]]s.",
        "Description": "Lakshu were all nearly identical to each other, as the reigar had long ago changed their servants' appearance as part of the reigar ideal of art. Thus, all lakshu appeared as beautiful, green-haired, well-muscled females about {{SIrange|5'6\"|6'0\"|ft-in|long=yes}} in height. Only their fondness for tattoos, body paint, and elaborate clothing (at least when not in uniform) allowed others to easily tell them apart.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|171|[[Lakshu]]}}",
        "Personality": "Lakshu were militaristic and warlike harridans but restrained themselves to only laying waste to things when ordered to do so by their reigar masters.",
        "Abilities": "Lakshu were highly intelligent and deadly warriors in melee combat. Additionally, they possessed a talent for ''shakti'' use and repair.",
        "Combat": "In combat, lakshu relied on their weapons and their ''shakti'', and were known to enter berserk rages while fighting. They could also call upon and command up to three [[helot]]s in combat.",
        "Society": "Lakshu as a race served the reigar as bodyguards, shocktroops, ''shakti'' repair experts, and crew aboard esthetics. They were always found in this capacity and relied upon the esthetics for food and housing.\n\nLakshu society was militaristic: whenever two or more lakshu were gathered in one place, one was superior to the others, maintaining a strict hierarchy. Each lakshu knew her place and did not seek to elevate herself.\n\nLakshu were diurnal by preference and omnivorous. They reproduced via parthenogenesis, giving birth at specific times to a single child, who was then raised in a creche alongside other young lakshu.\n\nWhen a lakshu grew big enough to be of the proper weight for fighting, she pledged herself to her master and received a copy of that master's ''shakti'' and was named after it.\n\nLakshu were known to live in [[Realmspace]], [[Krynnspace]], [[Pirtelspace]], and the [[Astromundi Cluster]].<ref><ref>{{Cite dungeon/45/An Artist's Errand|10-11}}<ref>",
        "History": "No one knew how the lakshu and reigar came to be associated with each other, but they had been so allied for as long as anyone could remember. It was generally accepted that a lakshu raiding party had landed on the reigar homeworld, but, after seeing the ''shakti'', realized that an alliance would be better. Since the lakshu also had an affinity for repairing ''shakti'', (a task which the reigar disdained as mundane and repetitious,) an alliance suited the reigar as well, and they set about appropriating the lakshu as a work of art. In keeping with the reigar ideal of a single work of art, this meant making a uniform appearance for the lakshu race.",
