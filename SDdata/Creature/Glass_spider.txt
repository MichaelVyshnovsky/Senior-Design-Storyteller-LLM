'''Glass spiders''' were a large breed of spiders that had entirely translucent bodies.

==Description==
The translucent bodies of these spiders were white in coloration. Though translucent, only the internal organs of their abdomen were visible from the outside.

==Abilities==
Like many spider species, the glass spider carried a [[poison]]ous bite. They were uniquely able to temporarily make themselves [[invisibility|invisible]].

==Ecology==
Glass spiders typically laid eggs in clutches of four. These eggs contained a sort of [[arsenic]], which would spray out and poison anyone that broke them open.
===Habitats===
These creatures could be found in the [[Demonweb Pits]]<ref> and on the planet of [[Eberron]].
