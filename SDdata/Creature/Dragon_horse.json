        "mainbody": "'''Dragon horses''' were a species related to [[ki-rin]]s that were only seldom ever encountered on the [[Prime Material plane]].",
        "Description": "On average a dragon horse grew to be {{SI|6|ft}} tall at the shoulder. They largely resembled a ki-rin, but lacked any horns. Their coats varied from shades of pale azure to silvery blue, while their flowing tails and manes were either pure white or silver. Their hooves ranged in color from deep sky blue to indigo.",
        "Personality": "Dragon horses ranged in intelligence from average levels to quite exceptional. They did not enjoy being land bound for any period of time and they lacked any interest in material possessions or treasures. The presence of evil-aligned creatures typically made them want to leave an area.",
        "Biology": "Dragon horses had incredibly keen senses that made them nearly impossible to be surprised. Their eyes could see in both the [[infravision]] and [[ultravision]] spectrums. They reached maturity at the age of twenty.",
        "Abilities": "Dragon horses possessed a form of aura sense, allowing them to sense the [[alignment]] of whatever creatures. They also had a rudimentary form of [[empathy]]. Together these magical senses made it incredibly rare for them to be misled by evil creatures.\n\nIn addition, these creatures were capable of exhaling at will effects similar to the [[spell]]s ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[fog cloud]]'', and ''[[gust of wind]]''.",
        "Combat": "Besides their magical breath, these creatures fought with their hooves.",
        "Society": {
            "Habitats": "Dragon horses primarily inhabited the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], though they could travel to the [[Astral plane]] and [[Ethereal plane]] and thus were occasionally encountered in those [[plane]]s. They were also known to inhabit the [[Seven Heavens]]. On the [[Prime Material plane]], they could be encountered in the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].",
            "Languages": "These creatures a spoke rudimentary form of the [[Ki-rin language|Ki-rin Tongue]]. Much of their communication with others was accomplished through mutual empathic reception.",
            "Relationships": "Dragon horses were highly desired as a [[mount]] by many creatures, though it was extremely rare for anyone to achieve such a feat. Those who did were typically companions or associates of the dragon horse."

        "Trivia": "* The ''[[Tome of Twelve Seals]]'' was capable of conjuring a dragon horse."
