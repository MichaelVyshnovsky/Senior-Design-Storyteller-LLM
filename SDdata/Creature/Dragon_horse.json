        "mainbody": "Dragon horses were a species related to ki-rins that were only seldom ever encountered on the Prime Material plane.\nOn average a dragon horse grew to be  tall at the shoulder. They largely resembled a ki-rin, but lacked any horns. Their coats varied from shades of pale azure to silvery blue, while their flowing tails and manes were either pure white or silver. Their hooves ranged in color from deep sky blue to indigo.\nDragon horses ranged in intelligence from average levels to quite exceptional. They did not enjoy being land bound for any period of time and they lacked any interest in material possessions or treasures. The presence of evil-aligned creatures typically made them want to leave an area.\nDragon horses had incredibly keen senses that made them nearly impossible to be surprised. Their eyes could see in both the infravision and ultravision spectrums. They reached maturity at the age of twenty.\nDragon horses possessed a form of aura sense, allowing them to sense the alignment of whatever creatures. They also had a rudimentary form of empathy. Together these magical senses made it incredibly rare for them to be misled by evil creatures.\nIn addition, these creatures were capable of exhaling at will effects similar to the spells cone of cold, fog cloud, and gust of wind.\nBesides their magical breath, these creatures fought with their hooves.\nDragon horses primarily inhabited the Elemental Plane of Air, though they could travel to the Astral plane and Ethereal plane and thus were occasionally encountered in those planes. They were also known to inhabit the Seven Heavens. On the Prime Material plane, they could be encountered in the continent of Kara-Tur.\nThese creatures a spoke rudimentary form of the Ki-rin Tongue. Much of their communication with others was accomplished through mutual empathic reception.\nDragon horses were highly desired as a mount by many creatures, though it was extremely rare for anyone to achieve such a feat. Those who did were typically companions or associates of the dragon horse.\n* The Tome of Twelve Seals was capable of conjuring a dragon horse."
