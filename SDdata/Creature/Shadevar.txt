The '''shadevari''' were horrifying creatures from the ancient history of [[Abeir-Toril]]. Little was known of them save for what was said to be written in the ''[[Mal'eb'dala|Book of Shadows]]''.

==History==
The shadevari first appeared some time after the creation of [[Realmspace]] by [[Ao]], when there was naught but the primordial essence, in a state of chaos, shadow, and timeless nothingness. It is unknown to all whether the shadevari came from someplace else or were spawned by the shadow itself. Nevertheless, they moved in this void before even the [[goddess]]es [[Shar]] and [[Sel√ªne]] coalesced.

Later, after the creation of the worlds and the war between the goddesses, the shadevari gave aid to Shar, helping her regain her might. Desiring the dark over the blinding light, the shadevari stalked the nascent Realms and sought to meld dark and light into the shadowy chaos it had once been.

In time, the god [[Azuth]], the High One, god of mages and consort to [[Mystra]], realized a means of trapping the shadevari. He created an [[illusion]] of a realm of shadows over a pocket-sized [[crystal sphere]] outside [[Toril]], and the shadevari inevitably came inside to investigate. Azuth then imprisoned the unwitting shadevari inside with the [[Shadowstar]], a key of shadows forged by [[Gond]], which he then hurled into the depths of the cosmos. This let life flourish on the worlds, and thwarted Shar's scheme to reshape them to her own desires.

In the [[1364 DR|Year of the Wave, 1364 DR]], [[Caledan Caldorien]], a [[Harper]], was corrupted by the evil power of the [[Shadowstar]] and began to transform into the [[Shadowking]]. Caledan released three shadevari servants. His former adventuring companions destroyed the creatures, saved Caledan, and prevent the Shadowking's return.
