        "mainbody": "A '''beholder mage''' was a [[beholder]] which was blind in its central eye&mdash;thus lacking its innate [[antimagic]] powers&mdash;and had taken advantage of this circumstance to train as a [[wizard]].{{Cite book| author = [[Allen Varney]]| title = [[Spelljammer: Wildspace]]| year = 1990| publisher = [[TSR, Inc]]| ISBN = 0-88038-819-6| pages = 62}} They were one of two kinds of beholders which could cast [[arcane spell]]s, the other being [[elder orb]]s.",
        "Description": "The distinguishing feature of a beholder mage was its blind, destroyed, or missing central eye. While some made an effort to hide this deformity, others proudly displayed their ruined eye or the wound or [[disease]] which had rendered it useless.\n\nMost beholder mages were a bit smaller than the average beholder.",
        "Abilities": "A beholder mage used its dead central eye as a [[Spell focus|spellcasting focus]], and was able to cast spells by [[Somatic component|wiggling and writhing]] its eyestalks and singing a spellcasting song. A beholder mage was able to sing songs of such complexity that they could juggle the [[verbal component]]s of several spells simultaneously.\n\nBeholder mages advanced their spellcasting by converting their eyestalks to \"spellstalks\". A beholder mage who had sacrificed all ten eyes could gain the ability to consume magic with its dead central eye: spells directed at the creature could be captured by the eye, which would glow red with the contained magical energy until the beholder mage made an effort to absorb and feed on that energy.\n\nBeholder mages prepared [[spell]]s in the same manner as a wizard and kept track of their spells with a [[spellbook]], although their physical limitations meant that they needed either to have some form of ''[[telekinesis]]'' to manipulate this book&mdash;and some developed the ability to freely use ''[[mage hand]]'' for such tasks\n\nIn some ways, beholder mages' spellcasting skills were more limited than a normal wizard. For instance, they were unable to learn spells that increased their capacity to memorize more spells&mdash;such as ''[[Rary's mnemonic enhancer]]''&mdash;and some were unable to learn spells from more than one [[school of magic]]. They also tended to struggle with spells that took more than one minute to cast.\n\nAbout one in ten beholder mages also had [[psionic]] abilities.",
        "Personality": "Beholder mages tended to be antisocial. Nevertheless, they were more willing to engage in diplomacy than the average beholder, although almost always with the intent to betray or undermine.",
        "Combat": "Depending on how many eyestalks had been dedicated to spellcasting, a beholder mage fought with a combination of wizard spells and their own innate powers. They took full advantage of their unique ability to cast multiple spells simultaneously.\n\nIf one of a beholder mage's spellcasting eyestalks was severed, the mage lost the ability to cast spells with it until the stalk could be regenerated.",
        "Society": "The ancient and unique spellcasting techniques and traditions of the beholder mage were largely developed to overcome the innate physical difficulties of spellcasting without hands. In many cases, beholder mages developed their own spells to better suit their limitations, and many spells that looked familiar to normal wizards were in fact the product of efforts to duplicate those spells. such as the ''[[Crown of Eyes]]''.{{Cite dragon/406/Eye on the Realms: Xraunrarr Will Triumph|4-6}}\n\nThe main prerequisite to becomeing a beholder mage was the loss of sight in a beholder's central eye. Most beholder mages had either been born blind, lost their central eye during battle, or were so ambitious that they intentionally put it out in order to study [[magic]]. Normal beholders tended to shun beholder mages, although others saw them as disabled and worthy of pity rather than ostracization. The necessity of sacrificing the powers of their eyestalks to cast spells was generally abhorrent to beholders, so very few were eager to take up the path of a beholder mage.\n\nMajor populations of beholder mages in [[Faerûn]] were found in the [[Underdark]] beholder cities of [[Ooltul]], where the [[phaerimm]] [[Triumvirate]] had forcibly converted two hundred beholders into mages, and [[Zokir]], where wizardry among beholders was discouraged but not forbidden.\n[[File:Orichalxos.PNG|thumb|center|500px|''A beholder mage in its sanctum.'']]",
        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "The spellcasting eyestalk of a beholder mage could be substituted for a normal beholder eyestalk in any [[potion]] that called for that ingredient, but it would frequently result in unpredictable if not bizarre side effects."
        },
        "History": "The origins of the beholder mage spellcasters was unclear. Some scholars believed that the first beholder mages had likely been born blind,\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-350}}, the phaerimm seized control of the beholder city of Ootul, precipiating the conversion of hundreds of beholders into beholder mages at their behest. They still controlled the city as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By that time, both the phaerimm and the beholder mages of the city had independently developed a way to create mutant, miniature [[beholderkin]].\n\nBeginning sometime ''circa'' the 4{{th}} or 5{{th}} centuries DR, the [[hive mother]] [[Xraunrarr]] took up residence in the Underdark beneath eastern [[Cormyr]] and compelled many of her brood to become beholder mages. At some point, she warred with [[Hullack]], a [[druid]] who would become the namesake of the [[Hullack Forest]] (which was then still part of the greater [[Cormanthor]] forest), but she was slain by one of her own: the beholder mage [[Uldeeth]].{{Cite dragon/406/Eye on the Realms: Xraunrarr Will Triumph|2-3}} The remaining beholder mages created an organization known as the [[Xraunrans]], and as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, they were secretly manipulating [[Cormyrean]] society and had been doing so for centuries. Their aim appeared to be to ensure the ''status quo'' while secretly funneling riches and captives to themselves.",
