        "mainbody": "Nighthaunts were the weakest and smallest type of nightshade.\nNighthaunts were said to somewhat resemble a gargoyle made of night and shadow, including curling horns and a tail. The eyes were the only part that were a different color they were pale and lifeless orbs inset into the flat, triangular face.\nNighthaunts were thoroughly malicious creatures that took pleasure in the destruction of the good and the innocent.\nLike the other nightshades, nighthaunts radiated a desecrating aura of great power, but were averse to sunlight. Additionally, nighthaunts could drain the energy of living creatures by pressing their blank face against their victims.\nNighthaunts possessed a number of spell-like abilities, being able to mimic deeper darkness, detect magic, see invisibility, and unholy blight at will contagion, greater dispel magic, haste, and invisibility thrice each day and hold monster, finger of death, ice storm, and plane shift once each day.\nOne time each day, a nighthaunt could summon either 3-6 shadows, 2-4 wraiths, or 1 greater shadow to aid it.\nNighthaunts preferred to harass well-organized or stronger opponents from a distance with the spell-like abilities, often using deeper darkness and invisibility to cause confusion and division. They typically went for spellcasters first when they entered melee.\nNighthaunts were native to the Plane of Shadow, but they were drawn to places of defiled goodness and evil power, such as desecrated temples and emptied graveyards.\nIn 1375 DR, a nighthaunt named Ysval led an army of undead with the goal of conquering Thay."
