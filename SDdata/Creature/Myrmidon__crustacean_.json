        "mainbody": "Myrmidons were an unusual species of crustacean endemic to the Sea of Moving Ice.\nThey were typically found within estuaries, shallows, and shoals. They were valued by the Reghedmen tribes.\nTheir bodies contained a potent acid that could be harvested by gutting them.\nWhen diluted with distilled water, myrmidon acid could be used to remove rust. This mixture was sometimes used in the restoration of old relics in the North.\nIn the 15 century DR an alchemist examining a myrmidon found that the acid contained within its body was in fact the same type of acid that could be found inside of ants. Following this discovery, myrmidons gave rise to a number of theories regarding what the biological relationship between crustaceans and insects truly was."
