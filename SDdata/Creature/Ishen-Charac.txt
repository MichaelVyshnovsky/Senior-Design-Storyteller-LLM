The Ishen-Charac was a bigger type of the heavier breed of horses that were often used as warhorses. They were commonly found throughout Tymanther, where they were prized and cherished by the dragonborn.
The Ishen-Charac were big, powerful wide-backed horses, specifically breed to be able to bear dragonborn riders.
A few dragonborn clans were known for breeding the Ishen-Charac, among them clans Shestandeliath and Clethtinthtiallor.
Dragonborn didnt use their Ishen-Charac for war until the Invasion of Tymanther of 1479 DR, when the Lance Defenders implemented their first cavalry units on horseback.
