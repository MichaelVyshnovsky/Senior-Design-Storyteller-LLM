        "mainbody": "Ravens were black birds similar to crows.\nThese creatures were very literal minded and often distracted by shiny objects. They were intelligent enough to be taught how to speak.\nthumb|Sometimes ravens had white feathers.\nRavens could be found across much of the continent of Faerûn, so much so that it was difficult to find an area devoid of them. Some regions included the High Moor and the fens and moors of the Moonshae Isles. Beyond Faerûn, ravens inhabited the continent of Kara-tur..\nBeyond the surface of Toril, large numbers of ravens could be found living in the asteroid known as the Castle, in the center of the Tears of Selûne. \nOutside of the Prime Material plane, ravens inhabited the Celestial Bureaucracys plane of Qui, the Domains of Dread, the plane of Acheron, and along the most commonly traveled branches of Yggdrasil, the World Ash.\nThese creatures typically harbored animosity towards owls.\nThe Raven Queen commanded numerous flocks of ravens from her divine realm in the Shadowfell. The ravens acted as the Queens scouts and messengers across the multiverse, also alerting and guiding her shadar-kai servants to the location of items and memories that she wished to collect.\nRavens were also allies to wereravens and were usually found together. It was very common for kindnesses of wereravens to hide in plain sight among unkindnesses of ravens.\nIn the city of Ravens Bluff, a business known as the Raven Express used trained ravens to deliver mail.\n* Some Ysgardian dwarves could assume the form of a raven."
