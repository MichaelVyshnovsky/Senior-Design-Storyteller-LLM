Smaller species of crayfish inhabited the waters of [[Lake Sember]] in [[Cormanthyr]] The reservoirs of the meadow called [[Halendos]] in [[Aglarond]] were home to crayfish.\n\nA species of crawfish was known to inhabited bodies of water in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Usages": "The [[Painted Boat Restaurant]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] sold cooked river crayfish for mere five [[silver]] [[coin|pieces]].{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Living City: The Painted Boat Restaurant|17}}",
        "History": "At some point in [[Cormyr]]'s past, people of [[Nesmyth]] brought popper crayfish over from from the [[Wyvernwater]] to the [[Starwater River]]. This changed the river's biome. The most fish in the lower Starwater was consumed by the crayfish and the abundance of these frustrations attracted [[electric eels]] that fed on them."
