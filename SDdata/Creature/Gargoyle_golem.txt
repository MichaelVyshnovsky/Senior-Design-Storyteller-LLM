'''Gargoyle golems''' were a rather rare form of [[golem]] that resembled a [[gargoyle]] and were largely unique to the [[Domains of Dread]].

==Description==
Gargoyle golems resembled their namesake, standing roughly {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighing between {{SIrange|500|550|lb|k|long=yes}}, but were only ever carved from [[granite]]. They were difficult to distinguish from simple statues when inactive, but when moving their bodies produced the sound of rocks grinding.

==Abilities==
Beyond their appearance, the trait that set gargoyle golems apart from other golems was that any creature slashed by their claws would suffer [[petrification]]. They also the possessed the innate [[magic resistance]] typical of golems. The [[spells]] ''[[earthquake]]'' and ''[[dispel magic]]'' were noted as being capable of shattering a gargoyle golem if targeted directly at them.

Despite being carved with wings like their namesake, gargoyle golems were incapable of flying. They also were incapable of communicating in any way and seem to suffer no harm from falling great distances.

==Combat==
Gargoyle golems typically confronted their opponents by pouncing on them from heights as high up as {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}. Once up close, they would pound enemies with their stone fists in order to petrify them and smash their stone bodies into pieces.

==Ecology==
Gargoyle golems were typically constructed to protect a specific structure,

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], several gargoyle golems were noted on [[Toril]] as being inside the [[Hall of Wonders (Ravens Bluff)|Hall of Wonders]] in [[Ravens Bluff]], each of them perched atop one of the stair-posts of the entry hall's two grand staircases.<ref>
