        "mainbody": "ihstu () were a type of elemental creature of air.\nMihstu had a cloud-like appearance, being swirling mists  in diameter that could shape their bodies at will and seep through the smallest of cracks or openings.\nThe bodies of these creatures were impervious to harm from electrical-based attacks, magic missile, or missile weaponry. And they could only be harmed by weapons with a +2 or greater enchantment. Cold-based spells and abilities would temporarily stun them.\nMihstu tyically fought other creatures in two ways. The first was would shaping their body to form four solid tentacles with razor-sharp talons. The second was to envelop their victim in their body and gradually drain away their constitution.\nMihstu were largely solitary creatures that preferred to be alone. To that end, they would often take on a ghostly shape in order to scare away intruders.\nMihstu were almost never encountered anywhere but on the Elemental Plane of Air.  Though some claimed to have occasionally encountered them in the Great Conflagration, most likely in an elemental pocket of air. Whenever they were found on the Prime Material plane, it was in cool, damp places that had little or no sunlight.\nDespite their solitary nature, some mihstu were known to work for magic-users in exchange for powerful magic items."
