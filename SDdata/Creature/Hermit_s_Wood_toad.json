        "mainbody": "The '''Hermit's Wood toad''' was a breed of [[frog]] or [[toad]] found near [[Hermit's Wood]] in [[Cormyr]].<ref group=\"note\">No official name has been given for this creature. \"Hermit's Wood toad\" has been adopted for the sake of clarity in this article. The source labels them both as frogs and as toads; it is uncertain which they should be.\n\nIt was green with reddish striations and had eyes that were unusually large. Incredibly, these animals had the ability to see [[invisibility|invisible]] creatures, even invisible creatures from other [[plane]]s. They tended to make a very loud noise when they spotted an invisible being.\n\nThe Hermit's Wood toad was previously thought to be only a local myth. However, [[Lucas Surin]] discovered it to be true when he went on a hunting party and a thief with a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'' thought to use the magic to scout ahead and stalk a [[deer]]. He strayed too near a group of frogs sitting in the sun by a stream, when they were alerted, only settling when he removed the ring. The hunters chose to study the frogs instead; Lucas wrote of it in [[1367 DR]]."
