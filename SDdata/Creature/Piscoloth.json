        "mainbody": "'''Piscoloths'''({{Pronounce|PIS|ko|lothz|refs=}}), sometimes referred to as '''piscodaemons''', Their cruel command over lesser yugoloths often resulted in betrayal by their supposed underlings, with only the threat of death keeping their brutish minions at bay.",
        "Description": "Piscoloths had an alien assortment of traits from various marine creatures, standing {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall on their razor-sharp talons. Their visages resembled those of carrion crawlers, with short, writhing mouth tentacles and a pair of faceted, walleyes that bulged out from either side of their heads. Piscodaemons also had red, chitinous bodies like those of [[lobster]]s, huge [[crab]]-like pincers at the end of their humanoid arms, and [[fish]]-like tails.",
        "Personality": "Piscoloths were not only sadistic bullies but also slavering sycophants, tyrannically lording over those beneath them with cruel pettiness while obsequiously fawning over more powerful entities. They thoroughly enjoyed being able to command others to do their bidding, a task suited to their tactical minds and leadership roles. Both avaricious and ambitious, they were easy to bribe and eager to betray those they saw as their hated rivals.\n\nChallenging their loose authority was likely to provoke their ire but given their personalities, subservient behavior was also dangerous, making treating them as equals the safest choice. Though they were [[neutral evil]], the commanders had the taint of [[law]] and were the first caste in which a yugoloth began to understand both law and [[chaos]].",
        "Abilities": "Although they might appear frail to some, piscoloths were physically adept, with claws capable of severing limbs if one was not careful. Their tentacles could inject a potentially lethal paralytic venom into their victims, making it dangerous to get near their maws. Their insectoid eyes let them see all around them, preventing conventional attempts at ambushes. Being aquatic in nature, they were resistant to water-based abilities and could easily maneuver underwater.\n\nA wide array of spell-like abilities were at their disposal, including ''[[blink]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[protection from good]]'', ''[[scare]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'' at will, and ''[[meld into stone]]'', ''[[phantasmal killer]], and ''[[stinking cloud]]'' ''three times every day. Due to their role as commanders, they were excellent summoners able to easily summon a small squadron of mezzoloths, [[skeroloth]]s, and, with somewhat more difficulty, other piscoloths. More recent reports stated them to have strange psychic abilities through mental screams and mad visions.",
        "Combat": "As the direct overseers of yugoloth armies, piscoloths normally entered battle themselves after their soldiers had already waded in. They were among the few yugoloths to naturally form groups, often gathering into small bands in order to command companies of mezzoloths. Eventually, they charged in emitting noxious air, attempting to seize foes with their claws and inject them with their venom before dragging them off to eat later.",
        "Society": {
            "Habitat": "Piscoloths were despotic dwellers of the deep, and natives of the [[Fated Depths]], but could be found throughout the Lower Planes."
        },
        "History": "A trap set by the [[sarrukh]] on a door in one of their temples to seal away a tomb would summon a [[piscoloth]].<ref>"
