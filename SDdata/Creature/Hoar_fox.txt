'''Hoar foxes''' were a rare animal found in cold climates.

==Description==
Hoar foxes looked like regular [[foxes]] but instead of red fur, their fur was silver-grey in color.

==Behavior==
Hoar foxes were calm animals, only aggressive if it or their pack was in danger.

==Abilities==
Hoar foxes had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[cone of cold]]'' [[spell]] at will. This was their primary form of defense and could hit a target up to {{SI|30|ft}} away. Hoar foxes were immune to cold-based effects and spells, and were particularly vulnerable to fire-based effects and spells.

==Ecology==
Hoar foxes were found in cold climates living in small packs.

===Habitats===
In [[Faerûn]], hoar foxes were known to live in [[Icewind Dale]],, the [[Ice Mountains]], and the [[Spine of the World]]. Beyond Faerûn, hoar foxes could be found in the cold climate regions of [[Kara-Tur]].

===Relationships===
[[Ranger]]s in cold locations sometimes had a hoar fox as a companion animal.{{Cite dragon/106/More Range for Rangers|35}}

===Usages===
Hoar foxes were hunted for their pelts, which were in high demand due to its color. An intact hoar fox pelt could be sold for up to 100 [[gp]].
