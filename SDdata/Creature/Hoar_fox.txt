Hoar foxes were a rare animal found in cold climates.
Hoar foxes looked like regular foxes but instead of red fur, their fur was silver-grey in color.
Hoar foxes were calm animals, only aggressive if it or their pack was in danger.
Hoar foxes had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the cone of cold spell at will. This was their primary form of defense and could hit a target up to  away. Hoar foxes were immune to cold-based effects and spells, and were particularly vulnerable to fire-based effects and spells.
Hoar foxes were found in cold climates living in small packs.
In Faerûn, hoar foxes were known to live in Icewind Dale,, the Ice Mountains, and the Spine of the World. Beyond Faerûn, hoar foxes could be found in the cold climate regions of Kara-Tur.
Rangers in cold locations sometimes had a hoar fox as a companion animal.
Hoar foxes were hunted for their pelts, which were in high demand due to its color. An intact hoar fox pelt could be sold for up to 100 gp.
