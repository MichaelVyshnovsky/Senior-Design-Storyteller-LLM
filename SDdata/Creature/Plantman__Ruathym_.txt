'''Plantmen''' were four-armed monsters with a large, vertical maw. They emerged on the island of [[Ruathym]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]].{{Cite comic/Divine Rights|8-13, 16}}

==Description==
Plantmen had a muscular, roughly humanoid shape, with four tentacle-like arms, three-taloned feet, and a vertical yellow-rimmed maw that resembled that of a [[wikipedia:venus flytrap|venus flytrap]] instead of a head. Situated beneath their jaws were a pair of glowing yellow eyes.<ref group="note" name="eyecolor" /> Plantmen were green-skinned.

==Behavior==
Plantmen were aggressive, seemingly attacking non-plantmen on sight.

==Combat==
Plantmen attacked primarily by striking and constricting opponents with their tentacles, as well as by biting down on their restrained prey's head.

==History==
Some time after [[Labelas Enoreth]] and [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] fought on [[Ruathym]], plantmen started appearing on the island, attacking inhabitants and the crew of the ''[[Realms Master]]''. Although the crew managed to escape thanks to the intervention of Labelas, many of the island's inhabitants died to the creatures' onslaught.
