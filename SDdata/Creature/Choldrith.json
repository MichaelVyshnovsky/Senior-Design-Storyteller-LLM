        "Description": "Choldriths had eight slender legs (although the front two served as arms) and resembled bloated white [[spider]]s about {{SI|9|feet|long=yes}} in diameter. Their faces resembled those of chitines, with some [[humanoid]] features, faceted eyes, and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Their ears looked like horns.",
        "Combat": "When possible, choldriths used their chitine subordinates as fodder to shield them in battle while they used their clerical [[spell]]s.\n\nThey could spin webs like a spider, and could throw out net-like webs to ensnare foes up to {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} away. Also like a spider, their bite was highly venomous.",
        "Society": "Choldriths were priests and spellcasters. They lived alongside chitines in villages inside caverns filled with maze-like webs. In the center of the cavern was always a temple to [[Lolth]]. Choldriths served as the leaders of each village, as they were seen as blessed by Lolth.\n\nCholdriths were found alongside chitines in the [[Upperdark|upper]] and [[Middledark|middle]]-[[Northdark]].",
        "History": "Choldriths were said to have been created by Lolth herself. It was believed that transformation into a choldrith was a kind of twisted reward bestowed by the Spider Queen on those who passed her tests, not unlike how transformation into a [[drider]] was a punishment for failing her tests.",
        "Notable Choldriths": "* [[Shelwen Darkenweb]], Matron of [[Chortoj]] and a leader of Yathchol.\n* [[Qed Weakeater]], Matron of [[Yiechit]] and a leader of Yathchol.\n* [[Cruanyl Corpsewrapper]], Matron of [[Vlorsk]] and a leader of Yathchol.\n* [[Lurawen Bladelicker]], Matron of [[Lortch]] and a leader of Yathchol.\n* [[Roaswen Webwaiter]], Matron of [[Othmo]] and a leader of Yathchol.\n* [[Nelwen Undercutter]], Matron of [[Athkaratch]] and a leader of Yathchol.\n* [[Quor Silkstriker]], Matron of [[Temmchor]] and a leader of Yathchol."
