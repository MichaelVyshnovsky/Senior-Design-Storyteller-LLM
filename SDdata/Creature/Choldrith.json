Their faces resembled those of chitines, with some humanoid features, faceted eyes, and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Their ears looked like horns.\nWhen possible, choldriths used their chitine subordinates as fodder to shield them in battle while they used their clerical spells.\nThey could spin webs like a spider, and could throw out net-like webs to ensnare foes up to  away. Also like a spider, their bite was highly venomous.\nCholdriths were priests and spellcasters. They lived alongside chitines in villages inside caverns filled with maze-like webs. In the center of the cavern was always a temple to Lolth. Choldriths served as the leaders of each village, as they were seen as blessed by Lolth.\nCholdriths were found alongside chitines in the upper and middle-Northdark.\nCholdriths were said to have been created by Lolth herself. It was believed that transformation into a choldrith was a kind of twisted reward bestowed by the Spider Queen on those who passed her tests, not unlike how transformation into a drider was a punishment for failing her tests.\n* Shelwen Darkenweb, Matron of Chortoj and a leader of Yathchol.\n* Qed Weakeater, Matron of Yiechit and a leader of Yathchol.\n* Cruanyl Corpsewrapper, Matron of Vlorsk and a leader of Yathchol.\n* Lurawen Bladelicker, Matron of Lortch and a leader of Yathchol.\n* Roaswen Webwaiter, Matron of Othmo and a leader of Yathchol.\n* Nelwen Undercutter, Matron of Athkaratch and a leader of Yathchol.\n* Quor Silkstriker, Matron of Temmchor and a leader of Yathchol."
