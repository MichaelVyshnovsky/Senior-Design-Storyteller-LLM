        "mainbody": "'''Island giants''' were malevolent [[giant]]s found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.",
        "Description": "Island giants varied greatly in their appearance, but all were horrific. They were [[humanoid]] in shape, possessing bestial features that could include tails, horns, monstrous appendages, and a single [[cyclops|cyclopian]] eye.\n\nThese behemoths on average stood {{SI|18|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SI|8000|lbs.|k}}. They usually dressed in rags crafted from the sails of ships they had wrecked.",
        "Abilities": "Female island giants had an innate ability to ''[[shapechange]]'' into any [[human]] or humanoid form at will. They typically selected the form of a beautiful giant or human female as their form. They used this ability to find a mate and lure prey to their death. When in giant form, females were just as adept at males in tossing and catching boulders.\n\nWhen young an island giant was capable of breathing underwater. They used this to flee from danger, including the anger of older giants.",
        "Combat": "Like many giants, island giants were adept at tossing boulders. They used this skill to deter anything from following them and to sink ships. They were also skilled at catching any similar objects thrown in their direction. Since they were not skilled craftsmen, they used their fists for close combat.\n\nIsland giants enjoyed luring ships into carefully placed [[trap]]s so that they could feed for an extended period of time as opposed to just sinking a ship outright.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "As omnivores, island giants ate anything they could, including [[seaweed]] and the bodies of beached [[whale]]s. Live food was preferred, prompting them to attack any passing ship. If well fed, an island giant could live for a millennia.",
            "Languages": "Island giants communicated via a broken form of [[Midani]] that was mostly unintelligible by others who spoke Midani, in part because it included random words from other [[giant language]]s."
