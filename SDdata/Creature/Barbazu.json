        "Description": "Barbazu were {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall, often green-skinned humanoids, with roughly {{SIAdj|225|lb|k|long=yes}} muscled bodies. Their signature feature was their disgusting, wiry beards, which were occasionally infested with white maggots, although they could also be recognized by their pointed ears and long tails. Their skin was moist but covered in scales, and despite having clawed hands and feet they almost always carried massive saw-toothed [[glaive]]s.",
        "Personality": "Barbazu were volatile and violent, attacking at the slightest provocation and exploiting any opportunity to go on the offensive. They were extremely cruel, fighting not because of loyalty to the system or fellowship with their kin, but out of a need to injure, kill, and terrify.",
        "Abilities": "The beard of a barbazu contained a dangerous disease known as the 'devil chills', which caused those struck to develop a painfully burning rash. If not lashing out with their claws and beards, a barbazu could attempt to summon [[abishai]], [[lemure]]s, or simply additional barbazu. Barbazu could also whip themselves into a dangerous battle frenzy not unlike that of a [[barbarian]], fearlessly rampaging throughout the battlefield with no regard to personal safety. As a battle raged on, they were more and more likely to enter such a state and would stay enraged unless stopped or removed from the battle.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Blood war-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A barbazu legion holding formation against a  [[dretch]] horde.]]\nBeing the combat-craving creatures that they were, barbazu took every opportunity to engage in battle and often refused to stop until their opponents were slain. Their tactics were fairly direct, although they were trained to use teamwork to defend allies in the heat of battle. Most barbazu were armed with a saw-toothed glaive with a backward-curving, treble hook at its base. While the blade itself serrated their foes and caused them to bleed profusely, the hook could be used to drag back fleeing enemies. Due to their attachment to their own glaives, they normally refused to fight with their claws unless they were unable to use them.",
