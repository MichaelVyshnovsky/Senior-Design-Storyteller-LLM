        "mainbody": "A '''giant constrictor snake''' was a much larger version of the normal [[constrictor snake]].",
        "Description": "The giant constrictor snake was around 45 feet (14 meters) long, with green scales that helped it blend in with its surroundings.",
        "Abilities": "So strong was this great snake that it would take at least four strong humans to even have a chance of uncoiling it from around a victim.",
        "Species": {
            "Snow Serpents": "A subtype of the giant constrictor snake was the snow serpent, a particularly large and dangerous form, highly adapted to the sub-arctic climate. Where most snakes had scales, these had white fur. These 100-foot-long (30 meters) snakes would hide in the snow and wait for their prey to pass by. When they attacked, they would spring up and coil their loops around their victims. Far rarer than their cousins, their pelts fetched a hefty price quite unlike the skins of the ordinary giant constrictor snake."
        },
        "Behavior": "These snakes would usually hunt by dropping from above to grab their prey within their coils, then begin constricting and biting the prey. Once it had crushed and eaten its prey, it would sleep and digest for several days. They were known for being far more aggressive than their smaller cousins, owing to the greater amount of food they had to consume to survive.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "The giant constrictor snake preferred wooded areas or swamps, where the trees and foliage were to its advantage when hunting, but it was adept at swimming and they had been encountered in warm tropical waters miles from land.<ref> \n\nThe [[Cormanthor]] forest in [[north Faer√ªn]] was a known haven for these creatures,<ref> as was the [[Vast Swamp]] near [[Cormyr]].<ref>"
        },
        "Usage": "The skin of a giant constrictor snake was too stiff and bulky to be workable for anything but armor."
