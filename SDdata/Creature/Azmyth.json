        "mainbody": "An azmyth was a species of deep bat found in Faer√ªn and in the Underdark. \nAn azmyth was  long and had a  wingspan. They had crested heads, bearded chins, and white pupil-less eyes. Skin color ranged from leathery gray or mauve to emerald green.\nAzmyths ate flowers, small plants, and insects. \nAzmyths had higher-than-average intelligence. They often formed close friendships with other creatures for mutual benefit. These friendships could last a lifetime.\nAzmyths could strike with both their bite and their needle-sharp tails. They could unleash a shock attack, similar to the spell shocking grasp.\nAzmyths communicated by telepathy. They had the ability to know alignment. They could become invisible and create an area of silence around themselves.\nAzmyths were a favored animal of the Halfling deity Brandobaris and the Seldarine deities Aerdrie Faenya, Sehanine Moonbow, and Solonor Thelandira.\nA notable azmyth would be Xuxa, the animal companion of noted ranger and archeologist Baylee Arnvold."
