A '''kamadan''' ({{Pronounce|KÆM|a|dan|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was a [[leopard]]-like creature from the jungles of [[Chult]].

==Description==
Kamadans were otherwise identical to leopards, except for the additional six [[snake]] bodies protruding from their shoulders.

==Combat==
The typical strategy of a hunting kamadan was to use its [[sleeping gas]] breath weapon to knock its prey unconscious before moving for the kill. The snakes also possessed a powerful [[poison]] with their bites.

==Ecology==
[[File:Kamadan 1e.jpg|thumb|''Failed attempt to tame a kamadan.'']]
Kamadans hunted either alone or in mated pairs.

Some sages claimed that kamadans were related to [[displacer beast]]s, although most recognized that the similarities between them were coincidental and the creatures were unrelated. Kamadans were also known to despise displacer beasts and to attack them on sight.

A close relative of the kamadan was the [[kamatlan]], a similar creature that was native to [[Maztica]].
==Notable kamadans==
[[Shagambi]], one of the [[Primal_spirit#The_Nine_Trickster_Gods_of_Chult|Nine Trickster Gods]] of [[Chult]], was a wise and virtuous kamadan.
