A kamadan () was a leopard-like creature from the jungles of Chult.
Kamadans were otherwise identical to leopards, except for the additional six snake bodies protruding from their shoulders.
The typical strategy of a hunting kamadan was to use its sleeping gas breath weapon to knock its prey unconscious before moving for the kill. The snakes also possessed a powerful poison with their bites.

Kamadans hunted either alone or in mated pairs.
Some sages claimed that kamadans were related to displacer beasts, although most recognized that the similarities between them were coincidental and the creatures were unrelated. Kamadans were also known to despise displacer beasts and to attack them on sight.
A close relative of the kamadan was the kamatlan, a similar creature that was native to Maztica.
Shagambi, one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult, was a wise and virtuous kamadan.
