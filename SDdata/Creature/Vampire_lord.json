        "mainbody": "'''Vampire lords''' were especially powerful [[vampire]]s that often led their own armies of lesser [[undead]].",
        "Abilities": "Vampire lords possessed a number of innate powers, including immunity to [[disease]] and [[poison]], resistance to [[necrotic energy]] and natural [[regenerate|regeneration]]. They were however quite vulnerable to [[radiant energy]].\n\nThese powerful vampires were capable of raising recently-slain beings as servants, known as [[vampire spawn]].",
        "Combat": "Like lesser vampires, vampire lords could heal wounds they suffered by draining the blood of their victims. Their mere gaze could ''[[dominate person|dominate]]'' the minds of weaker foes.\n\nWhen truly threatened, vampire lords could transform into mist for up to one hour, and flee from danger.",
        "Society": "While most vampires remained solitary, they banded together on occasion under the leadership of a powerful vampire lord.\n\nEach vampire lord was bound to a certain resting place―such as a tomb or sepulcher―within it had to rest for a number of hours each day.\n\nInitiate [[Night Mask deathbringer|deathbringers]] of the [[Night Masks]] would take part in a horrific ritual in which they would consume their own blood out of the veins of a vampire lord. This would twist their nature into a more horrific form, allowing them to commit the most heinous acts in the name of their guild.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1444}}, the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] was conquered by a vampire lord. It could only be wrested from the lord's control by divine intervention from the [[solar]] [[Zariel]], who created a [[The Companion|false sun]] to drive its undead minions away.",
        "Notable Vampire Lords": "* [[Artor Morlin]], the undead master of the [[Fireplace Level]] beneath [[Waterdeep]].\n* [[Phultan]], the grotesque Duke of Whispers of the Night Masks.\n* [[Saed]] of [[Old Vaelen]], the [[Beast Lord]] that formed the alliance of monstrous creature factions in the [[Beastlands]].\n* [[Strahd von Zarovich]], ruler of the [[demiplanes of Dread|demiplane]] of [[Barovia]].\n* [[Cazador Szarr]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], the first known vampire to attempt the [[Rite of Profane Ascension]].<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larian_Studios Larian Studios] (October 2020).
