        "mainbody": "A stained glass golem was a type of golem resembling stained glass. They were constructed to blend in with the decor of a temple or palace, in order to hide them from view to all except unwanted visitors.\nThey resembled flat, two-dimensional imitations of people made from glass. They were silent and never communicated the only sound they made was a tinkling sound like delicate crystal wind chimes when they moved. As they moved, they flickered and twinkled as the light passing through them refracted.\nLike many golems, glass golems possessed a general immunity to most magic and spells. and the spell shatter,\nA stained glass golem could be repaired with mending, but healed rapidly on its own.\nThey fought by swinging their arms like broken glass, their edges were very sharp.\nThey were typically encountered alone, in pairs, or in groups of up to five.\nTo create a stained glass golem, a high-level arcane spellcaster skilled in glass-making required some  of glass shards and the spells geas/quest, limited wish, and polymorph any object, and it otherwise cost 10,000 gold pieces.\nDeep within the jungles of Chult, four of these golems were installed by the necromancer Zzarka Tuzarr within the stained glass windows of her sandstone pyramid stronghold.\nWithin the quiet village of Irl, many of the larger and wealthier families had a number of stained glass golems at their command."
