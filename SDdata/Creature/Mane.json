Eventually, you'll peel away the skin of what you thought was virtue and find a writhing pit of darkest sin... Hold that malevolent core in the palm of your mind for a time. Picture it expanding, slowly growing to become the size of your entire heart. Feel it thumping in your chest, stronger and stronger, attuning every fiber of your being to its wicked rhythms of pain and horror.

        "Description": "Manes were approximately {{SI|3|ft}} tall humanoids that were surprisingly light for their build, weighing only {{SI|15|lbs|k}}.",
        "Behavior": "Manes would normally make a decent rank-and-file combat force as their pure hatefulness drove them to attack any non-demonic entities they encountered. Objects carried no value to the manes as they only cared to fight and fought with what they already had.\n\nThey had no sense of self preservation and would continue to attack in a way detrimental to their own survival and those of their respective armies. Although they could not speak, they were able to understand simple concepts as a side effect of their limited tanar'ri telepathy, and could understand more complex commands made in [[Abyssal]]. When not actively being told what to do, they traveled in packs wandering the Abyss or acted simperingly towards higher demons.\n\n{{Fq\n| width  = 450px\n| float  = right\n| source = [[Jessyme Rauch]], tanar’ri specialist extraordinaire\n| text   = You want to understand the tanar'ri?

        "Combat": "Because manes would quickly forget why they were given weapons, it was easier for higher ranking demons to simply let them fight with their natural weaponry. Due to their lack of proper sentience, manes could not be magically mind controlled. They were ineffective combatants akin to sluggish [[dog]]s although their innumerable quantities compensated for their weakness.",
        "Society": {
            "Ecology": "Manes could not be truly killed except under very specific circumstances and normally when slain their bodies would disperse into a noxious vapor before reforming in the Abyss a day later. Unlike most demons, who rose in power based on how many they killed, manes could be transformed by the forces of the Abyss into more powerful tanar'ri at random. These transformations were largely unpredictable ranging from as simple as a [[rutterkin]] to as strong as a [[vrock]]. Manes with memories left were more likely to advance like this and the most despicable of them could transform into [[balor]]s or even [[molydeus|molydei]].\n\nLike dretches and rutterkins, chaotic evil mortals occasionally reincarnated into manes after dying in [[Thanatos (layer)|Thanatos]], one of the layers of the Abyss."
        },
        "History": "Along with other demons, manes roamed the streets of [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1485 DR|1485]]–[[1486 DR]]. \n\n[[Ship of chaos|Ships of chaos]] were tied together with strands of the spirits of manes. Such ships could also be powered by eating manes.\n\nIt was rumored that the mortals who were the most cruel in life before being turned into manes were imprisoned in a place called the Pits of Despair, purported to exist hidden underneath the [[Layers of the Abyss|Mountain of Woe]]. No sage or wizard had truly seen the Pits however, and it's existence was not truly confirmed ."
