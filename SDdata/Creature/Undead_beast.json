        "mainbody": "An undead beast was a very rare type of undead that was from both Toril and Krynn.\nUndead beasts were non-intelligent quadrupedal creatures that killed without a thought. They were about the size of small dragons and had exposed ribcages and torn, rotting flesh. Their heads and backs had several horns protruding from them. Despite usually walking on their hands and legs, they could also rear onto their hind legs.\nUndead beasts attacked with their powerful, fleshy arms and slashed with their beastly claws."
