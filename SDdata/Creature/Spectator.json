        "mainbody": "'''Spectators''' were [[outsider|extraplanar]] [[Beholder#Beholderkin|beholderkin]] native to the Clockwork Nirvana of [[Mechanus]]. The five-eyed entities were philosophical creatures often summoned to serve as watchful guardians.",
        "Description": "Spectators had {{SIrange|3|4|ft}} bodies, which weighed {{SI|250|lb|k}}.{{Cite dragon/139/Ecology of the Spectator|86-88}} Like regular beholders, they had a single main eye in the middle of their floating bodies.",
        "Behavior": "Spectators were vigilant and trustworthy, and could be relied upon to protect items in all but the most dire situations. They possessed two methods of behavior: a free-thinking mode and a contemplative mode. Free-thinking spectators would wander the planes at will, openly, if cautiously, chatting with those they came across. In their contemplative state, they were philosophers who would spend over a century pondering vast philosophical questions. Approached in this state they were still friendly and enjoyed discourse but would soon after request to be left alone so as to continue philosophizing. Years of isolation could result in spectators gaining personality quirks such as referring to themselves in the third person or adopting the voice of its summoner.\n\nSpectators disliked guarding things for lesser lifeforms, which most mortal summoners would qualify as, and would only do so hesitantly. After promising to do so, however, their loyalty to their summoner was absolute, guarding the object in question until their time was up. They prided themselves on their guardianship and refused commands to do anything else until asked to guard something else or they were allowed to leave a summoner's grasp. The greatest pleasure for most spectators was thwarting the forces of chaos and in defending valuable objects. A spectator's strong sense of justice dictated that creatures who did not intrude upon their duties had a right to live, and they would never attack a helpless opponent unless attacked via sly or cruel means. Killing creatures for any reason outside of duty or self-defense would lead most spectators to commit suicide in distress via self-imposed brain overload.\n\nSomewhat mild and even-tempered, they were even known to form friendships with other creatures, a trait that no other beholderkin or true [[beholder]] ever displayed.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Spectator bg3.png|thumb|''A happy spectator.'']]\nTheir main eye could turn spells back at the caster so long as they were in the nearby area and shooting at its face. The four eyestalks of a spectator could cause effects like the [[spells]] ''[[paralyze]]'', ''[[inflict moderate wounds]]'', ''[[fear]]'', and [[confusion]]. They were capable of creating enough food and water to sustain themselves for one day, every day, meaning that they would never go hungry, and could also [[planeshift]] once per day.\n\nWhen trapped within the bounds of a ritual circle created with beholder eyes, a spectator was powerless to use any ability besides levitation.",
        "Combat": "Spectators were peaceful and would never attack unless seriously provoked. When not guarding something, if they were attacked by any opponent powerful enough to harm them, they would typically flee. Spectators only willingly fought against those who disturbed what they were guarding, those who persistently pestered them, and other spectators.  The methods used to repel foes would become more drastic as the battle continued, starting with fear and confusion and escalating into paralysis and enervation.\n\nThough they could planeshift, they would only do so to retreat if injured in all eyes to the point of non-functionality, thus leaving them incapable of guarding their wards. If chased after this point, they would defend themselves by biting at their pursuer. They would return one day after leaving, and in any circumstance, their ward's disappearance would prompt them to return to Nirvana for good.",
        "Society": {
            "Deities": "Some spectators served certain deities, including [[Gaerdal Ironhand]], [[Gorm Gulthyn]], [[Helm]], and [[Savras]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}} They were often employed by the [[Church of Helm]], and watched over their temples as ever-vigilant guardians."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Life Cycle": "Newborn spectators arose from the eyes of their recently deceased 'parent'. Each was born with the ability to levitate, along with the eye ray power of whatever stalk they came from. One spectator had the ability to create food and water and shared it with its siblings. Every 3 months a new eye power would be gained and the spectators would grow larger. After a year passed, each spectator would leave their birth home and create their own lair. Once a spectator became 1,000 years old the cycle would reverse in a sense, with their eyes becoming progressively larger and their body slowly turning smaller at the same points in time that the new spectators would gain eye powers. Nine months after their thousandth birthday, the spectator would grow 4 tiny eye stalks on each of its old eye stalks and 3 months afterwards would die, causing the cycle to begin anew. Neither newborn, nor elderly spectators could be summoned via the ritual."
        },
        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], [[Waterdeep]] was briefly plagued by a small army of spectators who were sent there to \"guard\" powerful and notable enchanted items, such as [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s [[Blackstaff (staff)|Blackstaff]] and [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron Paladinson]]'s [[Halcyon (sword)|Halcyon]]. The spectators caused panic and chaos in the city and guarded the entrance to [[Undermountain]]. Khelben deducted that Ibbalar Thrul, a disgraced wizard and businessman, was likely behind the attack. He sent one of his agents into the [[wizard]]'s lair in Undermountain. Subsequently, the summoning portal was sealed, and Ibbalar's attack was stopped.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "The annals of Helm's church claimed that the God of Guardians, in times long past, created the spectators as the ultimate guardians to assist his fallible human followers, only for various dark gods to corrupt them into beholders and their various kin. Followers of [[Bane]] meanwhile purported that their own tyrannical deity made the eye tyrants as the ultimate rulers, and that spectators were Helm's inferior imitations. Followers of Helm tried to destroy beholders and kin whenever possible, while Bane's returned the favor regarding spectators.",
        "Notable Spectators": "*[[Aloxag]]: the spectator bodyguard in service of the [[Red Wizard]] and an apprentice of [[Halaster Blackcloak]], [[Ibbalar Thrul]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
