A '''bird maiden''' was a creature unique to the [[Zakhara|Land of Fate]], and was related to the [[swanmay]] of [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Like swanmays, bird maidens were induced [[lycanthrope]]s, meaning they could only access their animal forms via a token. If this token was destroyed, the bird maiden would be stuck in her [[humanoid]] or [[bird]] form. However, unlike swanmays, bird maidens could transform into different types of birds, depending on their experience. Like swanmays (which were always proven [[ranger]]s or [[druid]]s), only those of specific training could become a bird maiden (always [[kahin]]a).

There were some other differences between the two shapechangers. Bird maidens were only active during the day and were more solitary than their sisters from Faerûn. Being more solitary, they were united by their faith and beliefs, but didn't form sororities as such. Bird maidens were not necessarily good, and some [[evil]] ones may have been able to shapechange into [[blood hawk]]s and [[vulture]]s.

The most proficient bird maidens could transform into [[giant eagle]]s, whilst newcomers could only transform into small birds, such as [[parakeet]]s.

The [[verbal component]]s of their spells were sung, instead of spoken. Bird maidens were great [[herbalist]]s.

==Personality==
Bird maidens got along with those who protected and respected the land, such as [[desert rider]]s and [[Mystic (Zakhara)|mystics]].

==Combat==
They fought with [[spear]]s, [[dart]]s, and arrays of spells, but didn't wear [[armor]] that was heavier than [[Hide armor|hide]]. They were unable to [[turn undead]].
