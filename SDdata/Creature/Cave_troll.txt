Cave trolls were an instinctual, less intelligent sub-species of trolls that were predominantly found in underground lairs. Like others of their kind, cave trolls had an insatiable appetite and would endlessly hunt. They were brutal hunters, who relied heavily on their instincts, pouncing on their prey, raking and rending them with their claws.
These trolls were larger than their "regular" cousins, standing  tall while hunched over and weighing over .
These trolls were most commonly found in the Galena, Earthspur and Orsraun mountain ranges. The Galena Mountains were north of the Moonsea while the others were located around the Sea of Fallen Stars. They could also be found in the Underdark, typically as servants to more intelligent beings like beholders, duergars, derro, phaerimms, and deep dragons.
