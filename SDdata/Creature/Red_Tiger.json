        "mainbody": "The red tiger, also known as a snow cat was a variety of wild feline commonly found throughout the North. They were particularly hardy, especially when compared to tigers from other lands.\nOver the course of the year, a red tigers coat changed from a tawny hue in the fall months, to a mottled white-red in winter, and again to a deep brown in the summer.\nWhen attacking their prey, a red tiger pounced, got a hold of it with its mouth, then raked it with its claws."
