        "Description": "Over the course of the year, a red tiger's coat changed from a tawny hue in the fall months, to a mottled white-red in winter, and again to a deep brown in the summer.",
        "Combat": "When attacking their prey, a red tiger pounced, got a hold of it with its mouth, then raked it with its claws."
