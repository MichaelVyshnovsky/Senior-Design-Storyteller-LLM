The first earth titans made by Rorn called themselves mordrins.\n\nA few of them founded the nation of [[Fimbrul]] in the continent of [[Laerakond]]. \n\nIt was believed by some scholars that earth titans were the ones who created the [[galeb duhr]] as a slave race, and Fimbran earth titans indeed had galeb duhr servants.",
