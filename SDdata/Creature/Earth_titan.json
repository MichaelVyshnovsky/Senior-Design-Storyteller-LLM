        "mainbody": "Earth titans were the most brutish of giants, who lived in mountains, rocky barrens, canyons, and other such regions.\nEarth titans were creatures whose bodies were made of rock and stone.\nEarth titans were cruel and territorial, and often enslaved weaker creatures. The mordrins were very calm as well, and unshakably loyal to the primordial Rorn the Fury.\nLike many giant races, earth titans fought their opponents from afar by hurling large rocks at them. Once the distance between them and an opponent was cleared, an earth titan would resort to smashing them with their fists. They were rarely ever known to retreat from battle, even when all signs showed that they were losing.\nMost earth titans of Abeir were servants of Rorn the Fury. The first earth titans made by Rorn called themselves mordrins.\nA few of them founded the nation of Fimbrul in the continent of Laerakond. \nIt was believed by some scholars that earth titans were the ones who created the galeb duhr as a slave race, and Fimbran earth titans indeed had galeb duhr servants. \nEarth titans were often known to inhabit deserts, canyons, mountains, and badlands.\nEarth titans were occasionally found fighting alongside ogres and trolls."
