An anchisaurus, also known as ankisaurus), was a species of dinosaur.
Anchisaurs were slightly longer than an average humanoid was tall. They had four legs but could temporarily walk on their two rear legs.
Anchisaurs avoided combat, even climbing a tree to get if it was large enough. Its teeth were sharp enough to deliver a painful bite against an opponent. 
Anchisaurs were obligate herbivores and lived in herds.
