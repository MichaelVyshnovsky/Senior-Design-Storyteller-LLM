        "mainbody": "'''Justice archons''' were zealous [[Celestial archon|archons]] devoted to the upholding of justice above all else and seeking out righteous vengeance against the wicked.",
        "Description": "Glorious and angelic, these beautiful, radiant creatures typically appeared as gold-skinned, gold-eyed, gold-haired, and gold-winged [[human]]s or [[elves]]. Most weighed about 190 pounds (86 kilograms) and stood about six feet (180 centimeters) tall.\n\nJustice archons were usually armored in [[full plate]]. They favored [[greatsword]]s or occasionally [[glaive]]s or [[greataxe]]s.\n\nLike many [[celestial]]s, justice archons did not actually possess a true sex, but they often appeared as males or females. They required no food, drink, or sleep to live.",
        "Personality": "Justice archons prioritized justice above other virtues. Unfortunately, they considered themselves the purest champions of justice, and many were quick to make judgments and leaned heavily toward self-righteousness, so it was not uncommon for justice archons to become fallen archons, seeking out justice in the absence of mercy and being exiled&mdash;either voluntarily or by order of higher powers&mdash;from [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]]. They considered the [[throne archon]]s, the official judges of the Seven Heavens, too distant, not willing to leave their judgment seats to take needed action.\n\nJustice archons particularly despised [[yugoloth]]s and would fight them at any chance. This disdain was because the daemons placed evil above all other philosophies. They further despised the inhabitants of the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]].\n\nThese archons avoided taking any actions that would upset the natural balance of any environment that they visited.\n\nJustice archons enjoyed wearing golden jewelry, such as necklaces, circlets, or torcs, and  also decorating their clothing and armor with such finery.",
        "Abilities": "Like most archons, justice archons could fly well&mdash;even when heavily armored&mdash;and could also [[teleport]] themselves. They could [[darkvision|see in darkness]] and dim light.\n\nJustice archons were always [[Magic circle against evil|protected by a magical barrier against evil]] and were immune to paralyzation and electricity. They were resistant to poisons and magic and could not be affected by mundane weapons or even low-powered magical ones.\n\nJustice archons could [[Detect evil|detect the presence of evil]] at will, call upon [[Aid|divine aid]], and create a source of [[continual flame]] whenever they desired.\n\nA unique power to justice archons was their ability to cause their weapons to deal damage in the same manner as their opponents. For example, if struck by a magical flaming sword, a justice archon could magically enchant its own weapon with that same power.\n\nLike all archons, justice archons could speak and understand any language that they desired.",
        "Combat": "While they technically would not enter combat without being provoked, it was easy to offend a justice archon's sense of justice. Using their power to detect evildoers by sight, they would charge into battle, calling for vengeance against any perceived wrongdoing against the innocent. They would seek to learn the nature of their enemies' attacks and then use their ability to return the same attack on their foes. They would often call on divine aid and favor before a battle, and if things grew overwhelming, they would teleport to safety and plan a counterattack.\n\nWhen engaged in battle, justice archons produced a menacing aura of righteousness that negatively affected their foes' ability to fight back. This fury was especially great in justice archons, and an aroused justice archon might accidentally destroy innocent bystanders while enacting vengeance on a guilty party.",
        "Society": "Justice archons were native to the city of [[Empyrea]] in [[Mertion]], the fifth layer of Mount Celestia.\n\nJustice archons were sent at the head of warparties to hunt down [[fiend]]s, and they were sometimes [[summon monster VII|summoned]] to the [[Prime Material plane|Material Plane]] by mortal [[cleric]]s seeking for retribution against some great crime. If called by a ''[[planar ally]]'' spell, a justice archon would serve for half the usual payment if asked to fight fiends and for free if asked to fight yugoloths. Because justice archons were more prone to righteous anger than other archons, their superiors often sent them on missions to the [[Lower Planes]], where there was no risk of innocents being accidentally punished.\n\nWhile most justice archons acted alone, some became champions among their kind, serving in roles similar to those of mortal [[paladin]]s and leading squads of other justice archons, [[hound archon]]s, or [[sword archon]]s or providing aerial support to hounds. [[Celestial creature|Celestial]] [[giant eagle]]s and celestial [[giant owl]]s often fought side-by-side with justice archons as well.\n\nIt was unknown to scholars what position justice archons held in the hierarchy of the Seven Heavens, but they were generally between hound archons and [[warden archon]]s in innate power."
