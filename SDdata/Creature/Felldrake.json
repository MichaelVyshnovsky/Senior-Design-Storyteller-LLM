Capable of coralling lesser felldrakes.\nthumb|250px|right|A spiked felldrake.\nFelldrakes were created by Bahamut after a group of powerful elven mages helped him defeat a demonic invasion. He then created the felldrakes to guard the elves against future incursions.\nTales from Nerath claimed that felldrakes were actually created by cruel, decadent nobles of an empire of that world, and had simply been bred from common drakes."
