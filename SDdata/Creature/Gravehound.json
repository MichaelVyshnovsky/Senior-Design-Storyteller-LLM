        "mainbody": "'''Gravehounds''' were animated corpses of medium-sized [[dog]]s and hounds, relentless canine [[zombies]]",
        "Description": "Gravehounds looked like dead and decomposing dogs or [[wolves]]. Their fur was falling off in ratty patches, exposing decaying muscles, bones, and sinew. Their teeth were often broken but still very deadly. Red spark of the dark magic that animated them flickered in their dead eyes.",
        "Abilities": "Like other undead, gravehounds were immune to [[disease]]s, [[poison]], resistant to ''necrotic'' damage and magic, and vulnerable to ''radiant'' spells and damage.\n\nGravehounds' rotted flesh was vulnerable to critical strikes, destroying these shambling canine corpses.",
        "Behavior": "Just like regular zombies, gravehounds were undead brutes that served their creators, disregarding their own wellbeing.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Gravehound 4e mm.png|thumb|''Sometimes, dead is better.''|265x265px]]\nGravehounds were far from intelligent and were dangerous due to their lightning speed, relentless assault, and sheer numbers. Their bite was the main weapon of the creatures, dealing ''necrotic'' damage to their targets. The necrosis caused by their putrid bite continued to rot the target's flesh until healed. These undead dogs' bite could easily knock a [[humanoid]] of medium or small size prone. The necromantic drive in these creatures was so strong, that even when destroyed, gravehounds managed to land one last bite to their slayer.",
        "Ecology": "Like other zombies, gravehounds were undead creatures who only existed to serve their masters and kill, then consume the living. In certain places, where the border between the [[Prime Material plane]] and [[Shadowfell]] was thin, the Plane of Shadows' corruption could bring zombies and gravehounds into existence. These \"wild\" zombies did not have masters and attacked anything alive on sight.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]] and its Shadowfell echo, gravehounds could be found on the world of [[Nerath]], deep within its version of [[Underdark]], close to [[myconid]] colonies.",
        "History": "Sometime ''circa'' [[1479 DR]], gravehounds could be found stalking the lands around the [[Spellguard]], accompanied by other zombies and [[wight]]s. [[Kalmo Darano]], a [[halfling]] [[wererat]] had a pack of four gravehounds under his control during the same period of time. Most of these foul beasts were destroyed during the search for the Lady [[Saharel]] by a group of adventurers.\n\nDuring the period of time around the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] of 1479 DR, gravehounds could be found plaguing the lands surrounding the [[Stronghold]] northeast of the [[Neverwinter Wood]] that was taken over by the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge. Gravehounds were also a part of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]'s undead army, and were often raised by [[Szass Tam]]'s [[Red Wizards]].\n\nDuring the disappearance of the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'' ''circa'' 1479 DR, a group of adventurers searching for the artifact came across gravehounds and their Thayan masters in the graveyards of [[Neverdeath]].\n\nIn [[Ches]] [[1480 DR]], [[Geran Hulmaster]], a [[swordmage]] from [[Moonsea]], and his companions [[Miyra]] and [[Sarth Khul Riizar]], encountered numerous gravehounds during their traversal of shadow-[[Hulburg]] in Shadowfell."
