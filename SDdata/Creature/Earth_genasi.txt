An '''earth genasi''' was a type of [[genasi]] that was able to harness the power of the earth.

==Description==
Earth genasi came in many physical shapes and appearances. Many carried obvious traits of the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], such as blocky features or earthlike skin, but others had earthlike features that were less apparent.

Earth genasi were usually born from the union between a [[dao]] and a [[humanoid]], from two earth genasi, or from humanoid parents with a dao somewhere in their ascendancy. They could also result from exposure to elemental energy.

===Abilities===
Earth genasi were able to harness the power of the earth. They had [[darkvision]] and were able to pass over the ground without a trace.

==Personality==
Earth genasi tended to be strong and tough, but were often stubborn and oblivious.

==Society==
Earth genasi could be found anywhere. However, they were more common in the [[Northwest Faerûn|North]] near the [[Spine of the World]], where there were ''[[portal]]s'' to the Plane of Earth. A small population of earthsoul genasi lived in [[Mulhorand]].

===Religion===
Common deities worshiped by earth genasi were [[Chauntea]], [[Geb]], and [[Grumbar]].
