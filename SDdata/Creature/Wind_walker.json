        "mainbody": "Wind walkers, or maswat-rih, were rare creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air where they served the djinn.\nThese creatures appeared like a mass of constantly writhing serpents. They were barely visible unless viewed while within a sandstorm. A distinct whistling or roaring sound preceded the approach of a group of wind walkers.\nWind walkers greatly enjoyed potent aromas and this could be used to lure them into traps.\nWind walkers could use telepathy to hear any thought within 100 yards (91 m). A group of wind walkers working together could use this ability up to .\nThe primary attack of a wind walker was a blast of forceful air. Any gas based attack used against them could be dispersed quickly, causing minimal damage.\nAll sounds of battle with a wind walker were muffled by the sound of roaring wind. Thus, orders from superior officers were nearly useless when facing wind walkers.\nAs partially ethereal creatures, wind walkers could only be attacked by other ethereal creatures such as djinn, invisible stalkers, or ghosts. Magical weapons were needed to physically strike a wind walker.\nWind walkers were immune to all forms of magical attack with the exception of any weather-related spell.\nWind walkers survived on water vapor and tiny specks of dust or other airborne particles.\nOutside of the Elemental Plane of Air, wind walkers could sometimes be found on the Prime Material plane. In the land of Zakhara, wind walkers could be found high in the mountains or in caves located deep underground. In the land of Kara-Tur, one to ten of them was always in the company of the dragon lords of spring, summer, fall, and winter.\nWind walkers possessed their own language, known properly as Wahaauri.\nThe djinn kept these creatures as cloud sculptors. They were also used to herd rain clouds.\nIn Zakhara, Al-Badia were careful not to offend the wind walkers because of their ability to bring, or prevent, rain clouds from coming to an area.\nSometimes wind walkers were forced to serve storm giants, cloud giants, and other powerful creatures found in the mountains.\nThey maintained good relations with the yak folk found on the planes. Wind walkers could also be found in Uroboros, the divine realm of the couatl deity Jazirian. And they acted as servants of the deity Aerdrie Faenya.\nIn 1358 DR, in the month of Alturiak, there were reports that wizards in Zhentil Keep had devised a way to summon and control wind walkers."
