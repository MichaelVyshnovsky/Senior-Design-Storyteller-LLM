        "mainbody": "shadowborn stalker was a humanoid who had undergone a radical transformation into a creature suffused with the power of the Shadowfell.\nThe transformation turned the humanoids skin to a pale gray, their hair to pure black, and their eyes to pupil-less white. The power of the Shadowfell embedded itself into both their body and soul, and created a sinister aura of shadow around them.\nShadowborn stalkers gained darkvision as well as the abilities to turn invisible or to create a  zone of magical darkness for a few seconds whenever they wished.\nBecoming a shadowborn stalker required striking a bargain with the powers of the Shadowfell to access the forbidden lore and dark rituals that enabled the transformation. The most likely individuals to pursue this path included assassins, thieves, and warlocks&mdashespecially among goblins, drow, and shadar-kai&mdashwho favored stealthy approaches to their problems.\n* Wei Chiang, a merchant and drug smuggler active in Westgate in the late 15 century DR."
