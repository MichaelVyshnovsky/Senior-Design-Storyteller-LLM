Niferns were scaly dog-like creatures often kept by scalykind.
Niferns were roughly goat-sized quadrupeds with a muscular body covered in mud-colored scales. Their eyeless heads looked like strange hybrids of those of canines and lizards, featuring elongated muzzles and oversized jaws. Additionally, their plated dog-like tails featured poisonous stingers, and were carried over their backs, much like those of scorpions.
Although blind, niferns heightened sense of smell made them excellent trackers.
The niferns appetite made them bloodthirsty creatures, attacking almost anything they encountered.
Niferns fought by rushing their opponents, attacking with their immobilizing poisonous stingers. Creatures that withstood the paralyzing effect were then attacked with their claws and jaws.
In the wild, niferns were known to form highly territorial packs of upwards of 30 individuals, typically led by the largest and strongest among their number.
Niferns were popular among scalykind. In particular, lizardfolk, troglodytes, and dragonkin frequently kept them as hunting animals, and yuan-ti additionally kept them as guards.
In their native Underdark, niferns were used as trackers by the likes of illithids, drow, and a number of other underground races.
On Flamerule 3, 1479 DR, a pack of niferns stalked Harp, Kitto, Boult, and Verran through the ruined city of Hisari.
