A '''wraith spider''' was a type of [[undead]] [[giant spider]]. 

==Description==
Appearing much like the monstrous spiders that they were in life, wraith spiders differed in a few noticeable ways. A wraith spider's eight eyes were nothing more than hollowed-out sockets and a shadowy aura emanated from the undead [[vermin]], congealing around the fangs as pure blackness.

==Combat==
Wraith spiders attacked and hunted in the same manner as their living counterparts. However, their [[venom]] glands were replaced with strength-sapping and [[energy drain|life-draining]] [[negative energy]].

Although they could not spin webs in undeath, wraith spiders still possessed the heightened sensitivity to vibrations and tremors that most spiders had.

==Ecology==
They were formed from the husks of giant spiders and animated as an undead by malevolent spirits from the domain of [[Kiaransalee]].
===Habitat===
Wraith spiders were known to haunt the swamps of the [[Lizard Marsh]] on the [[Sword Coast]].

==History==
[[File:Wraith spider nwn.jpg|thumb|''A translucent wraith spider.''|250x250px]]
During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], cultists of the [[drow]] [[deity]] [[Kiaransalee]] transformed many of the spiders living in settlements such as [[Maerimydra]] and [[Szith Morcane]] into wraith spiders as twisted mockeries of [[Lolth|Lolth's]] sacred creatures.
