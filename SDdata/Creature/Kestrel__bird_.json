        "mainbody": "A kestrel was a type of bird and one of several distinct species of falcon.\nSome, though not all, species sported a blue-crest.\nKestrels were a predatory bird, often feasting upon various species of rodents, rabbits, and voles.\nThe blue-crested variety of kestrels inhabited the continent of Kara-Tur. \nIn north Faerûn, kestrels could be found year-round in the land of Thar. In west Faerûn, kestrels could be found in and around the High Moor during the warmer months, migrating south during the winter. This included the central Moorlands, the High Moor marshes, the Fire Marshes, in and around the Highstar Lake, around the Misty Forest, the Red Cliffs, and near the Serpent Hills.\nBeyond the Prime Material, kestrels could be found alongside many other predatory birds as part of the hunting parties of Remnis.\n* The Tu Lung city of Hachou sported a blue-crested kestrel on its city banner alongside an owl and hawk.\n* Circa 1358 DR there was an adventuring company named for the birds, known as the Men of the Red Kestrel."
