        "Description": "Whether in elf or wolf form, lythari were uncannily beautiful. As elves, they were often tall and fair, with pale blue or green eyes and silver hair. As wolves, they had light grey or silver fur and blue or brown eyes that betrayed their intelligence.",
        "Ecology": "Lythari were true lycanthropes. They were born as were-creatures to lycanthrope parents. Lythari packs were almost exclusively encountered on the isle of [[Evermeet]], with only a few found in [[Faerûn]].\n\nLythari propagated using a ritual of bonding that would turn another person into a lythari. This ritual only worked if both parties agreed to the transformation. It left a permanent scar on the transformed, which resembled a wolf bite.",
        "Combat": "Physical combat was disliked among the lythari.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Lone lythari were readily accepted within normal wolf packs and treated deferentially but were left out of the pack hierarchy. Evil wolves such as [[worg]]s, [[werewolves]] and [[wolfwere]]s would attempt to drive off a lythari or slay them if at all possible. They could naturally sense a lythari was different.\n\nLythari were a [[favored monster]] of [[Eilistraee]] and [[Rillifane Rallathil]]."
        },
        "History": "The lythari were originally elves who came from [[Faerie]] to [[Faerûn]] around {{Yearlink|-24000}} but they changed considerably over the years. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], most Faerûnian scholars did not consider them to be Tel-quessir.",
        "Notable Lythari": "* [[Thorn]], a [[Moonhunter]] and champion of [[Eilistraee]].\n* [[Lendri]], a [[Vil Adanrath]] and blood-brother of [[Gyaidun]], a [[human]].<ref> He also stood as kin to [[Hweilan Inle Merah]].<ref>\n* [[Merah]], half–Vil Adanrath Lady of [[Highwatch]], and mother of Hweilan.<ref> \n* [[Ganamede]], pivotal companion to [[Arilyn Moonblade]].<ref>"
