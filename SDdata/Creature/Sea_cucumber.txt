'''Sea cucumbers''' were a species of harmless simple mollusk with soft bodies, lacking the common hard shell among other marine creatures from the same group.

==Ecology==
Sea cucumbers could be found in the [[Shining Sea]], and notably the among rich aquatic life around the [[Crystal Reef]], to the west of [[Tharsult]].

The products of seas, oceans, rivers, and lakes were a major food source in the lands to the east of [[Faer√ªn]], such as [[Kara-Tur]]. Sea cucumbers were among the seafood consumed and were considered a delicacy.
