'''Domovoi''' were a type of house spirit

==Description==
Domovoi were generally known to look like very hairy, {{SIAdj|2|ft}} tall [[humanoid]]s with dark, sooty skin. They typically wore rags that had been cast off by the inhabitants of whatever house they resided in.

==Abilities==
Domovoi had an immunity to fire and were capable of manipulating both it and smoke. Due to the ashes and soot that covered their bodies, they were also known to be rather slippery and difficult to grapple.

==Personality==
Domovoi were known to express content through humming, while expressing sadness with their sighs or groans. They generally held no strong inclination towards combat, but when driven away from their homes domovoi were known to become surly and even violent.

They often also placed a tripod of sticks on the roof of the house when people were in, removing those sticks and throwing them at people if it didn't like them.

They were particularly fond of old shoes left in the yard. 

==Combat==
Domovoi typically preferred to fight foes with their powers of fire manipulation, rather than with their bare claws.

==Society==
Domovoi generally did not have homes or villages. Rather, they covertly lived inside the homes of other races in cold regions and helped to maintain them at night. In the case of nomadic hunters, they would take up residence in their winter camps and work to maintain them until they eventually returned.

Domovoi were typically known to inhabit the homes of [[humans]], [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[neanderthal]]s, [[orc]]s, and even [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s.

===Diet===
Domovoi typically subsisted on small quantities of firewood and offerings given to them by their hosts. They were also known to catch [[rat]]s and [[mice]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, in the village of [[Dernovia]], the [[wychlaran]] [[Zofia]] instructed [[Liriel Baenre]] to befriend her house's domovoi with an offering of [[bread]] and [[salt]] wrapped in a cloth.
