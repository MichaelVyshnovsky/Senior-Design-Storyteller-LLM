        "mainbody": "Skunks were black-pelted mustelids with a characteristic white stripe running from their faces down to the tips of their tails. They were known for defensively spraying a foul-smelling musk cloud at attackers.\nCity-dwelling rangers often took skunks as animal companions.\nInventive kobolds were known to capture skunks in order to exploit their musk spray.\nSkunks were favored animals of Cyrrollalee and Rillifane Rallathil."
