'''Dragonnes''', also known as '''liondrakes''',{{Cite dragon/405/Nerathi Legends: The Knights of Rethmil|2}} were fierce [[drake]]s that combined characteristics of giant [[lion]]s and [[brass dragon]]s.

==Description==
Dragonnes largely resembled giant lions, with the [[brass]]y scale covering and a smaller version of the wings of brass dragons. Their faces, which were perched on a long neck and encircled by particularly thick and coarse mane, featured large feathery eyebrows and big, usually brass-colored eyes.{{Cite dragon/228/Greater Familiars of Faerûn|81}}

Dragonnes typically reached a length of about {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} and measured about {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} at the shoulders, and shoulder heights of {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}}.{{Cite dungeon/63/Blood and Fire|42}} A typical dragonne weighed {{SI|700|lbs|k|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Dragonnes were highly territorial and would attack any creatures invading their homes. They were not generally evil or malicious, allowing any intruders the opportunity to flee before they attacked. Those who did not leave a dragonne's lair would find themselves quickly set upon by a savage opponent.

During their month-long mating season, which occurred at the time of year when the days started to become colder, dragonnes were at their most erratic and dangerous. The creatures were much quicker to attack during this period, targeting anything they didn't see as a potential mate. When overtaken by their mating drive, dragonnes adopted different, less direct methods of attack, such as causing avalanches or dropping targets from high altitudes.

==Abilities==
[[File:Dragonne ADDTC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''A close-up of a dragonne.'']]
Unlike their fully draconic relatives, dragonnes only had a limited ability to fly, capable of staying airborne for up to half an hour.

The roar of a dragonne was its greatest weapon. Those who heard this creature's roar found their minds and body weakened, leaving them vulnerable to the attacks of the dragonne.

==Ecology==
Typically, dragonnes preyed on meek herd animals like [[goat]]s, [[antelope]]s, or [[camel]]s. Only in times of famine would they prey on [[humanoid]]s, despite their reputation for hunting helpless travelers. The [[Bedine]] had adopted a tactic to prevent dragonnes from attacking domesticated animals, namely by covering them with used clothing in order to give them the odor of people.

Dragonnes were known to serve [[Nobanion]], and they were counted among the power's [[favored monster]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|13}}

Dragonnes typically died violent deaths before reaching old age.

===Habitats===
Dragonnes were known to live in [[Maztica]]. The natives knew them as '''hakuna''', and unlike their [[Faerûn]]ian relatives, these creatures were jungle-dwelling and their scales were typically black. Some of the tribal [[halfling]]s of Maztica used such a hakuna as a kind of captive totem and fed them with humans and other intruders they managed to capture in their territory. Hakuna were also found in the scrublands of the [[Pasocada Basin]] and the [[Borderlands]], as well as the desert terrain of the lands of the [[Dog People]] and the [[Sands of Itzcala]], 

Other habitats for dragonnes included [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], the [[Dalelands]], [[Halruaa]], the [[Shaar]], the [[Battle of Bones]], [[Nada al-Hazan]], and the [[Furrowed Mountains]]. They could also occasionally be found in the [[Anauroch]], [[Raurin]], and [[Quoya Desert]]s.

A population of dragonnes made up an important part of the ecology of the [[Rathgaunt Hills]], curbing the destructive nature of the local [[manticore]]s and [[peryton]]s. After the [[hoarder dragon]] [[Amilektrevitrioelis]] decimated and chased off the creatures, the local ecology began to collapse, to the dismay of the Hills' [[druid]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/New Draconic Monsters}}

Dragonnes were also found on numerous worlds besides [[Toril]]. On [[Mystara]], dragonnes resembled hybrids between lions and [[gold dragon]]s, rather than brass dragons. While some [[Krynn]]ish dragonnes resembled those familiar to Toril, that world also boasted [[cougar]]- and [[tiger]]-based versions, as well as rare examples bestowed with traits from other [[metallic dragon]]s.

[[File:Axiomatic dragonne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''An axiomatic dragonne from the Infernal Battlefield of Acheron.'']]
Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], [[axiomatic creature|axiomatic]] dragonnes were found in [[Acheron]], and [[fire]] and smoke [[animental]] dragonnes were found on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and the [[Great Conflagration]], respectively.{{Cite dragon/347/Paraelemental Paragons|63-65}}

==History==
A commonly held view was that dragonnes originated in magical experiments conducted by ancient [[wizard]]s, who intended to create powerful mounts and guardians in the name of their lord by modifying lions with the essence of brass dragons.

Sometime around [[1374 DR]], dragonnes were being stabled by the [[Zhentarim]] as mounts within the [[Temple in the Sky]].<ref>

==Uses==
[[File:Jingling Mordo captive monsters.png|thumb|200px|right|''A dragonne, an [[owlbear]], and a [[minotaur]] in captivity at the Jingling Mordo circus.'']]
Amongst those with the capability to keep them, dragonnes were popular [[animal companion]]s with [[moon elf|moon elves]]. Likewise, [[noble djinni|noble djinn]] were known to keep dragonnes as servants and companions. The wizard spell ''[[find minion]]'' could also bring forth a dragonne minion, and would give the spellcaster long, feathery eyebrows reminiscent of those of the creature in this event.

The short-lived [[Dwarven Air Cavalry]] of [[Kallamos Var]] rode on the backs of dragonnes. [[Zhentarim skymage]]s and [[avariel]] [[skywarden]]s also sometimes used dragonnes as [[mount]]s.{{Cite dragon/233/On Wings of Eagles|21}}

Dragonnes were hunted by [[barbarian]]s, and their pelts were worth about 2,000 [[gold piece]]s.

[[Quon's Collectible Creatures]], a monster shop that catered to wizards looking for components for magical experimentation, stocked dragonnes.

==Notable Dragonnes==
[[File:Zu'l Janah.png|thumb|200px|right|''Zu'l Janah, a giant dragonne.'']]
A hakuna known as [[Chalocka]] stalked the jungle around [[Uxma]] the Sorcerer's pyramid. The [[couatl]] allowed the creature to remain so it would act as a deterrent to visitors, though he typically would not let the beast outright slay people trying to approach his lair.

[[Zu'l Janah]], whose name meant "The Winged" in [[Midani]], was a giant dragonne who laired in a sandstone cave in [[Badu al-Kabîr]]. He owed his size to his unusual longevity, having been at least 150 years old by the {{YearlinkName|1367}}{{AQ-time}} due to his ''[[ring of contrariness]]''.{{Cite dungeon/63/Blood and Fire|36}}{{Cite dungeon/63/Blood and Fire|42-43}}

A horn of black [[ivory]] kept in the Star Houses of [[Solon]] could summon an ancient black-scaled dragonne. This creature was looking for its old master, and would attack anyone else it found blowing the horn.

One of the chambers within the [[Halls of the Beast-Tamers]] featured a [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] dragonne enchanted with mild protective magic.
