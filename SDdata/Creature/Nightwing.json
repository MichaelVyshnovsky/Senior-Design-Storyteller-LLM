        "mainbody": "Nightwings were a type of nightshade, horrific undead monsters of evil and darkness.\nNightwings appeared as nothing more that bat-shaped darkness, but they had a  wingspan and weighed .\nLike other nightshades, nightwings possessed a  desecrating aura but were averse to sunlight.\nNightwings in particular could drain the magic from items with but a touch, and they had a number of spell-like abilities as well. They could mimic the spells contagion, deeper darkness, detect magic, haste, see invisibility, and unholy blight at will confusion, greater dispel magic, invisibility, and hold monster thrice per night and cone of cold, finger of death, and planeshift once each night.\nAdditionally, one time each night a nightwing could summon a number of undead either 5–12 shadows, 2–4 greater shadows, or 1 dread wraith.\nNightwings attacked from the sky, and made liberal use of haste in combat.\nNightwings were native to the Plane of Shadow. They spent most of their time hunting on the wing.\nLike other nightshades, they sometimes acted as servants of Shar."
