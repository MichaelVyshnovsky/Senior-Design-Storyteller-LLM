        "mainbody": "Cyclopes (  ) were a race of giant-kin distinguished by having a singular, central eye.\nCyclopes were one of the smallest types of giants, standing only  and weighing , Cyclopes had earthy skin tones that blended with their surroundings. Males and females cyclopes of the Feywild were notably bald and had spiked heads instead of hair.\nThe most peculiar and distinguishing thing about cyclopes was the fact that they only had one large eye in the middle of their foreheads. It tended to be the same as the color of their skin. This eye was rumored to cause fear in any who looked at it. Their single eye gave them poor depth perception, however, and therefore they couldnt use missile weapons very well.\nCyclopes could throw boulders\nCyclopes typically worshiped Grolantor, for they admired his power and might over giant-kin.\nOther sources claimed that cyclopes did not worship any gods, as they saw little benefit from prayer and disliked rituals for they seemed too complicated and foreign. However, a cyclops that gained some kind of benefits of apparently divine origin or else was threatened an unnatural force would pay homage to the supposed deity in order to retain their gift or avoid that threat, at least while it remained.\nCyclopes made many different and powerful magical and non-magical items. Their most proficient blacksmiths could forge rings of great magical power and swords with blades of lightning. Fomorians were known to highly value their skill in forging magical items.\nthumb|right|A pair of cyclopes.\nThey usually served as bodyguards, blacksmiths, soldiers, Some eladrin believed that the roles they played in these societies were so crucial that they would be severely weakened without the cyclopes.\nSome cyclopes lived in such places as Nacmoran.\nWhen not living in cities, many cyclopes lived in caves, ruins, or forests\n* Citadel Umbra\n* Curna Mountains\n* Giants Belt Mountains \n* Kryonars Caverns\n* Mines of Tethyamar\n* Oman\n* Veldorn\n* Snapping Turtle Bay\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, cyclopes could be found in the Feywild, particularly in the Dark fey enclave and Realm of Malabog. They also existed on the plane of Arboreas layer known as Olympus and on the plane of Theros.\nThere existed a wide variety of contradictory legends surrounding the origins of the cyclopes, many of them not having originated from the cyclopes themselves. They generally had little interest in how their people came to be, though many on Toril claimed they descended from the line of Annam All-Father, chief of the Giant pantheon. Most other giants on Toril believed the brutes came from one of Otheas trysts. Other myths suggested they were descendants of Annams son Karontor following his banishment or were descendants of the god Vaprak.\nAccording to some accounts, the cyclopes originated in the Feywild, claimed that some of the cyclopes were originally the children of the primeval deities Gaea and Uranus, the latter of whom locked them up in the plane of Tarterus until they were eventually freed and later aided the Olympians in overthrowing the greater titans.\nthumb|right|Chancil Crystalheart summoning a cyclops to beat Conner.\nIn the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, the mage Chancil Crystalheart of Memnon summoned a cyclops to beat Conner to death but eventually relented and dispelled the summons."
