'''Bhaergalas''' were solitarys creature found in temperate or tropical woodlands and jungles. It was a large predator whose favorite prey was [[humanoid]]s.

==Description==
It resembled a combination of [[wolf]] and [[lion]]. Its fur had a unique smell, similar to freshly baked [[bread]].

==Combat==
The bhaergala favored ambushes. It would pounce upon its target, from downwind, and attack with their claws. It could drop from up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} without harming itself. It would use its teeth to tear chunks of flesh from its targets, and was known to toss them aside for later consumption. The bhaergala had limited magical resistance, and could turn a spell back at its target, but only four times in a 24-hour period. This ability was not innate and required focus from the bhaergala.

A defense against the bhaergala was that it could be lulled to sleep with a song. This defense would fail if the creature felt threatened, was injured, attacked or was interrupted while hunting.

==Ecology==
[[File:Bhaergala and instruments.png|thumb|273px|''A group of young bhaergalas.'']]
Being a solitary creature, it would only seek out other members of its species to mate with. The mating process would only occur in a sandy area. Gestation was 6 months long. The parents of young bhaergala would remain together for up to a year, until the young could kill on their own. 

The bhaergala had a den but preferred to sleep in tall trees. The den was visited rarely and was used as a storage space. The bhaergala would collect musical instruments and occasionally magical artefacts. These would come from the bodies of its prey.
===Habitats===
In the Realms they particularly inhabited the jungle land of [[Chult]] and the forests of [[Cormanthor]], between [[Mistledale]] and [[Shadowdale]].<ref> Beyond [[Toril]], bhaergala could be found on the world of [[Athas]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/173/The Monstrous Side of the Dark Sun World|11}}

===Languages===
Bhaergala could mimic speech and were typically capable of speaking [[Common]].
===Relationships===
Bhaergala acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deities]] [[Rillifane Rallathil]] and [[Solonor Thelandira]].
