        "mainbody": "'''Pan lung''', also known as '''coiled dragons''', were [[dragon]]s that were found in crypts and temples of [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "Pan lungs were physically distinguished by their enormous size, up to 142 feet (43 meters) in length. They resembled [[shen lung]] in appearance but were longer and thinner. Born with grey scales, a pan lung can develop scales in a number of colors. Green, orange and red scales were the most common. Its scales were naturally oily, which made them shimmer in sunlight. They had a polychromatic mane that surrounded its neck, and had dark whiskers.",
        "Personality": "Pan lungs were unconcerned with the affairs of other [[lung dragon]]s and would only work with other dragons if ordered to do so by the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]. They resented and were fiercely jealous of [[t'ien lung]] and would sometimes attack one unprovoked in a jealous rage.",
        "Abilities": "A pan lung had several innate magical abilities. They were able to use ''[[scaly command]]'' to command several creatures, the number of which depended on the dragons age. They also had the ability to surrounded themselves in an aura of ''[[water fire]]''., ''[[bless]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[curse]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'' and ''[[ventriloquism]]''. Once a day they could cast ''[[mirage arcana]]'' and ''[[phantasmal killer]]''.",
        "Ecology": "At birth they can immediately breathe both water and air. Despite not having wings, a pan lung was able to fly. This was achieved with magical blood-red [[pearl]]s embedded in their brains. If found on a dead pan lung or removed from a live one, this pearl was worth 1,000[[gp]] yet did not retain its magical abilities. Their lairs were in the crypt or temple assigned to them by the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], which they guarded jealously. This duty was passed down to the offspring of a pan lung. \n\nUnlike most dragons, pan lungs were herbivores, with a diet mainly of fruits and vegetables. They had intricate and vast gardens which were tended by their minions.",
        "Celestial Bureaucracy": "Within the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], pan lung served as guardians of hidden places. The [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] would often punish [[humans]] who were disloyal to their family by making them minions of a pan lung. Once a minion, they did not age and served a term determined by the Celestial Bureaucracy. A minion obeyed its pan lung master unconditionally, even to the death. As well as minions, some pan lungs had slaves, usually controlled with ''[[scaly command]]''.",
        "Notable Pan Lung": "* [[Za-Jikku]]"
