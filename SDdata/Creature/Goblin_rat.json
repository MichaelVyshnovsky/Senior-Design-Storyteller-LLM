        "Description": "Goblin rats' shapechanging ability allowed them to assume two forms: that of a small [[humanoid]] and that of a giant [[rat]]. In rat form, they resembled a regular rat, with a length of up to {{SI|3|ft|c}}. Their rat form had a mouth that was packed with incredibly sharp fangs. When in humanoid form, they appeared as a diminutive and skinny \"ratman\", whose facial features vaguely resembled those of a rat. They were short, had skinny bodies, and greasy skin. Their eyes tended to dart about.",
        "Personality": "Goblin rats were utterly terrified of all species of [[cat]]s. When approached by any [[feline]], a goblin rat would typically go into a panic.",
        "Abilities": "Goblin rats, especially their animal form, carried communicable diseases such as cholera and plague.",
        "Combat": "While goblin rats were natural cowards and avoided combat whenever they could, a cornered or hungry goblin rat was able to unleash a deadly and vicious assault. In animal form, goblin rats used their razor-sharp teeth and claws as weapons. While in humanoid form, they could use armor and weapons, however, if they shape-changed into a rat, their armor and weapons dropped around them.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Goblin rats were omnivores, eating whatever was available. They did not forage nor hunt, instead they raided the crops and livestock of nearby human farmers.",
            "Homelands": "Goblin rats lived within ruins on the outskirts of human towns and villages. They hoarded treasure within their lairs, depositing it into deep holes within.",
            "Relationships": "Goblin rats were not known to have any predators, primarily due to their flesh being inedible. [[Oni]] occasionally hired packs of them to act as servants.",
            "Usages": "Some locals in Kara-Tur believed that goblin rat whiskers cured baldness and made a tonic by boiling them in water."
