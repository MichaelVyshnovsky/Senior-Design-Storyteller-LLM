        "mainbody": "'''Dreads''' were [[demon]]s from the [[Abyss]]al layer of [[Belistor]] that fed on souls.",
        "Description": "In their home on Belistor, dreads looked like bluish-gray, winged, and slightly malformed [[humanoid]]s with long arms ending in long, gray claws. Their faces were ovoid with round eyes and a thin slit for a mouth. Where lesser dreads were thin and wiry, their form oscillating between physical presence and pure emptiness,\n\nUnlike most other demons, dreads fed directly on souls. They had an intense craving for mortal souls, mostly to satisfy the emptiness inside of them rather than from a need for sustenance. Souls that had been \"corrupted\" in [[undead|undeath]] were considered unpalatable.\n\nDreads communicated using [[telepathy]].",
        "Abilities": "Because their home layer of Belistor was in close proximity to the [[Negative Energy plane]], dreads were suffused with [[negative energy]]. Although this granted dreads many of their powers, it also meant they were highly sensitive to [[positive energy]] and needed to shield themselves when visiting any plane that wasn't either Belistor or the Negative Energy plane. Apart from that, dreads were completely immune to poison and electricity, and highly resistant to any damage from cold, fire, and acid.\n\nThe touch of a greater dread could cause a potent effect similar to the [[spell]] ''[[enervation]]''; those affected would become severely weakened unless the greater dread was slain or if they were immediately moved over {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} away from the demon.\n\nGreater dreads commanded a number of potent [[spell]]-like abilities, such as ''[[blasphemy]]'', ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[desecrate]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect law]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[fire storm]]'', ''[[greater dispelling]]'', ''[[implosion]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[symbol]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[unhallow]]'', ''[[unholy aura]]'', ''[[unholy blight]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''. They also continually [[detect magic|detected magic]] in their vicinity.\n\nAdditionally, a greater dread could instantly transform living creatures into [[ghast]]s. These undead would not be under the dread's complete control, through which they could summon one or two lesser dreads every day.\n\nFinally, greater dreads could evoke a wave of pure negative energy around them, causing any living creature struck to suffer effects similar to a potent ''[[energy drain]]'' spell.\n\nLesser dreads possessed only some of the the powers of greater dreads; they had no spell-like abilities, could not open ''gates'' to Belistor, could not create ghasts, and could not create waves of negative energy.",
        "Personality": "Dreads viewed mortals as nothing more than livestock, and had nothing but contempt for them.",
        "Combat": "In combat, dreads enjoyed terrifying their opponents. Dreads never used weapons, preferring to attack using their claws to cause the ''enervation'' effect in their victims before feasting on their souls.",
        "Society": "All dreads resided in Belistor, which was the domain of the [[demon lord]] Yrsillar.",
        "History": "The first dread known to have been summoned to [[Toril]] was Yrsillar himself, when he was summoned by the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Avarix]] to kill members of a rival household. The greater dread was in extreme pain from exposure to the Prime Material plane, but ultimately completed the task and won his freedom from Avarix.\n\nOver six hundred years later, in [[Hammer]] of {{Yearlink|1371}}, Yrsillar was summoned to the city of [[Selgaunt]] in [[Sembia]] by [[Krollir Venasten]], a [[cleric|priest]] of [[Mask]] and the leader of the [[thieves' guild]] known as the [[Night Knives]].{{Cite dragon/277/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Shadow's Witness|103}} Venasten hoped to use the demon to crush the [[Zhentarim]] leadership in the city, allowing his own guild to rise in prominence. Unfortunately, the summoning ritual was disrupted by one of Venasten's lieutenants, [[Drasek Riven]], who was a double agent for the Zhents. Suddenly freed, Yrsillar turned on Venasten and took possession of his body as Riven fled.\n\nYrsillar was surprised to find that he felt no pain while inhabiting the body of Venasten, The dreads terrorized Selgaunt for a short while, but were ultimately defeated by [[Erevis Cale]], a butler who had become the champion of Mask, and [[Jak Fleet]], a [[Harper]] thief. Yrsillar was banished back to Belistor.",
        "Notable Dreads": "* [[Yrsillar]], a greater dread and the demon lord of Belistor.\n* [[Araniskeel]] and [[Greeve]], lesser dreads in the service of Yrsillar."
