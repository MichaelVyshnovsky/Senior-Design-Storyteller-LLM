        "Description": "Erinyes originally appeared as imposing yet beautiful figures, so attractive that they could be easily mistaken for [[celestial]]s. An erinyes generally stood around {{SI|6|ft}} tall, weighed approximately 150 pounds (68 kg). \n\nTheir natural forms normally possessed glowing red eyes, as well as large, feathered wings that stayed regardless of the form that they took.\n\nWith [[Asmodeus]]' ascension to [[deity|godhood]], the erinyes lost their wings, and received hooves and fangs in return, which made them look beastly as of the late 1470s DR.",
        "Personality": "{{quote\n|It is in the choice of enemies that a devil ﬁnds itself.\n|Zagrish, an erinyes philosopher.\n}}\n\nErinyes were not only physically stunning, but dangerously capable, highly disciplined and unfailingly loyal to their lords.

        "Abilities": "Erinyes had powerful charming abilities causing those they looked upon to obey their every whim. Their domination was so complete that the victims were willing to protect their enchantress even at the cost of their own lives and obeyed their orders without regard for the lives of others. The charm could last indefinitely, only fading upon the victim's death or if dispelled by the erinyes, although they could only use it against one individual at a time. Conversely, an erinyes could strike terror into anyone that looked upon them, causing them flee in panic.\n\nTheir magic helped them disguise their own presence while their [[truesight]] allowed them to see through the magical disguises of others. When gating other devils for assistance they could call upon weaker ones such as a small group of [[lemure]]s [[spinagon]]s, or [[barbazu]]s, or another erinyes.",
        "Combat": "[[File:BackfromtheWar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The erinyes warrior Castalla returns, bruised but unbowed, from another engagement in the eternal [[Blood War]].'']]\nErinyes, while not the greatest warriors of Hell, possessed legendary combat prowess. They were often armed with incredible swords and bows, but could expertly wield practically any weapon. Their conventional weaponry included powerful [[rope of entanglement|''ropes of entanglement'']] used to entrap powerful opponents and hapless victims alike. The normal battle strategy employed with the ropes was to bind their enemies before lifting them a great distance up and letting them fall. They were also known to use weapons coated in caustic venom.\n\nThrough the brutality they inflicted on the battlefield, erinyes renewed the vigor of their allies, often engaging multiple enemies at once with unbridled rage. Despite their fearsome wrath, Erinyes were also tactically adept, coordinating with others of their kind to surround groups of enemies as opposed to merely flanking them. Although erinyes had no qualms about engaging enemies on the ground, they preferred to fight from afar. They normally used their magical abilities first, sowing confusion into those below them before firing their bows.",

        "Ecology": "Erinyes were the only types of devils to have possibly been born rather than made from mortal souls. Unlike most devils that were capable only of siring children, erinyes were capable of carrying them. It was unknown if erinyes gained the ability before or after their descent but the ability to become pregnant was another reason they often refused promotion. They were protective and cautious parents that hid colonies of their young away from the eyes of those that would interfere with their development. \n\nWhile some reports claimed that devils could not be promoted into erinyes, others purported that the rank could serve as a reward for sluggish devils that overcame their earlier blunders despite numerous trials, such as [[abishai]]. Abishai that were promoted into erinyes were said to have their features rearranged by numerous [[kocrachon]] in order to make them more appealing to mortals and somehow had syllables added to their true names to make summoning them more complicated. It was rumored that only 500 erinyes were allowed to exist at one time, with lesser baatezu being promoted to fill their positions when current erinyes were promoted into higher forms.",
        "History": "Legend in the [[Nine Hells]] told that the first erinyes were [[angel]]s who fell from the heavens after being corrupted by temptation or committing some misdeed.\n\nWith the Ascension of Asmodeus, the erinyes received mastery over the [[succubus|succubi]], but received a terrifying transformation.",
