'''Dusters''' were small [[elemental vermin]] native to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] that could also be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

They were weaker relatives of [[dust devil]]s.

==Description==
These creatures resembled a small armadillo that walked upright and had human-shaped hands. They sported a long proboscis that they used during feeding.

==Ecology==
Dusters fed on flowers, or other scented items like [[perfume]]. If confronted, they used their power of [[invisibility]] and flew away. They were capable of creating a tiny whirlwind with their beak that temporarily blinded opponents.
