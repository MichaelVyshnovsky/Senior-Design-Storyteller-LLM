Dusters were small elemental vermin native to the Elemental Plane of Air that could also be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
They were weaker relatives of dust devils.
These creatures resembled a small armadillo that walked upright and had human-shaped hands. They sported a long proboscis that they used during feeding.
Dusters fed on flowers, or other scented items like perfume. If confronted, they used their power of invisibility and flew away. They were capable of creating a tiny whirlwind with their beak that temporarily blinded opponents.
