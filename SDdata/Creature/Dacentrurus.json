Instead of large bony plates running along its back, dacentrurus had long, sharp spikes. Its tail ended in a cluster of spikes.\nDacentrurus were known for being aggressive.\nWhen attacked, dacentrurus always positioned its body so their spikes were facing their opponent. It was capable of delivering significant damage with its spiked tail.\nDacentrurus were herbivores and lived in herds."
