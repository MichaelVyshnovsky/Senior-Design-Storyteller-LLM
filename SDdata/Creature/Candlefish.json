        "Description": "These tiny sensuous fishes had reddish-brown scales.",
        "Ecology": "Candlefish got their names from the fact that they were extremely [[oil]]y. So much so when they were dried, candlefishes could be lit to burn like [[candle]]s. They were edible and were a part of a winter's hero's feasts served during the annual [[Simril]] celebration in [[Twilight Tor]]. The feast also consisted of cooked [[brown bream]], [[blackjaw]], and [[durgrace]]."
