'''Lizards''' were scaly reptilian animals that came in a variety of sizes, colors, and patterns.Lizards are mundane animals brought from the real world into the world of Faerûn, and as such, they are generally not described in any detail in sourcebooks&mdash;readers must rely on their real-world knowledge. However, dangerous, challenging, and/or fantastical lizards will likely have their own page on the wiki.

==Description==
Lizards had a moderately elongated body, a tail that tapered down from their body width, and two pairs of legs held outward from the body.<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lizard The dictionary definition of a lizard] They were non-venomous usually palm-sized{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|48}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 40: Delzemaeran Delicacies, Part 2}} to two feet (sixty centimeters) in length, depending on species.

==Ecology==
Lizards were most abundant in warm climates with forested or jungle terrain, but lizards could be found most anywhere on land or underground except where very cold.
