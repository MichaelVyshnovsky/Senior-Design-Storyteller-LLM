Enchodus were a variety of fish found in the Sea of Moving Ice, most often around Icecrag Island, for which little was known about.
These fish sported large saber-tooths.
The enchodus were apex predators in the waters that they inhabited, with wounds matching their teeth even being found in the hides of much larger gurry sharks.
