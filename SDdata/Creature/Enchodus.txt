'''Enchodus''' were a variety of [[fish]] found in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], most often around [[Icecrag Island]], for which little was known about.

==Description==
These fish sported large saber-tooths.

==Ecology==
The enchodus were apex predators in the waters that they inhabited, with wounds matching their teeth even being found in the hides of much larger [[gurry shark]]s.
