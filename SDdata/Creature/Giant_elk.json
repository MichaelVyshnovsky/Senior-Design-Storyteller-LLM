        "mainbody": "Giant elks, otherwise known as giant stags, were a rare species of larger than usual deer.\nOn average these creatures stood  tall at the shoulder and weighed around .\nGiant elks fought other creatures with either their antlers or their sharp forehooves.\nLike any species of deer, giant elks were typically found in forests with a temperate climate.\nIn the Border Kingdoms they could be found in the forest of Hawkgarth. In the region of Kara-tur, they could be found in the forests of Akari island.\nMany cultures considered it taboo to hunt these creatures.\nThese creatures were so rare that sightings were interpreted as foreshadowing some important event, like the birth of a future king. Some legends even spoke of deities manifesting on the Prime Material plane in the form of giant elks."
