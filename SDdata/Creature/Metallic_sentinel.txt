A metallic sentinel was a type of construct built by metallic dragons.
They were made from the type of metal associated with their metallic dragon creator, and powered by a type of energy associated with its breath weapon.
Metallic peacekeepers were sentinels created in humanoid form. They were often dispatched by dragons to watch over settlements and communities with which their draconic masters forged a bond.
The dragonborn artificers of the Inquest maintained a number of metallic peacekeepers within the Supreme Forge in the city of Xorvintroth.
