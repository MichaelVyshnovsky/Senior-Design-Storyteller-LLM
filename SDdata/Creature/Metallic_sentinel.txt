A '''metallic sentinel''' was a type of [[construct]] built by [[metallic dragon]]s.

==Description==
They were made from the type of metal associated with their metallic dragon creator, and powered by a type of energy associated with its breath weapon.

==Subtypes==
[[Metallic peacekeeper]]s were sentinels created in [[humanoid]] form. They were often dispatched by dragons to watch over settlements and communities with which their draconic masters forged a bond.

==History==
The [[dragonborn]] [[artificer]]s of the [[Inquest]] maintained a number of metallic peacekeepers within the [[Supreme Forge]] in the city of [[Xorvintroth]].{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|18}}
