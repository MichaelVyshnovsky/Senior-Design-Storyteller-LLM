        "mainbody": "'''Glacier snakes''' were a rare species of [[snake]] covered in fur.",
        "Description": "Unlike most snakes, glacier snakes were covered in a thick pelt instead of scales. They had sharp fangs arranged as a ring within their mouths. Glacier snakes had a sharp stinger made from bone at the end of their tails.",
        "Combat": "Glacier snakes attacked their prey with their stinger and fangs.",
        "Abilities": "Glacier snakes were capable of healing quickly from wounds.",
        "Habitat": "Glacier snakes were found in the cold mountains of [[north Faerûn]]. Their natural range was along the [[Spine of the World]], as far south as the [[Cold Vale]] and [[High Ice]], and as far north as the southern [[Great Glacier]]. Monks of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] reported sightings of glacier snakes living on the [[Glacier of the White Worm]].\n\nIn the land of [[Samarach]], glacier snakes were a valuable commodity, sough after by wealthy beast collectors and seekers of exotic pets. Caged baby glacier snakes were sold at the [[illithid]] black market, hidden in the mountains east of [[Samargol]].",
        "Ecology": "An unknown internal process provided glacier snakes with enough heat to keep them alive in their frigid environments. When cut, a glacier snake's blood left its body as steam instead of a liquid.",
        "Uses": "The pelt of a glacier snake was very soft. Its softness and rarity made them a sought after material by merchants."
