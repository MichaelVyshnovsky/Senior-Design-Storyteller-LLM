'''Merrow''', also known as '''sea ogres''' or '''aquatic ogres''', were a breed of [[ogre]] adapted to aquatic environments.

==Description==
Merrow living in freshwater environs were more violent and quicker than land ogres. They had green, scaled skin, green eyes, and seaweed-green, slimy hair. They had black teeth and nails; webbed hands and feet; long, thick necks; underbites; and sloping shoulders. One in ten merrow had ivory horns, especially the most powerful males.

Merrow enjoyed tattooing their bodies. Females, especially, were often found covered in depictions of death and destruction all over their bodies.

==Personality==
Merrow were ignorant and superstitious brutes; their only skills were plundering and murder.

Merrow enjoyed [[gold]] and jewels and often overlooked dull magical items in favor of glittering prizes.

==Biology==
Merrow could breathe air and survive out of water for about two hours, thus they often came to the surface in search of food.

==Combat==
Merrow would sometimes attack coastal settlements or "intruding" ships. Using their green coloration, they could hide easily, becoming effectively invisible in oceanic terrain. They attacked from cover, using [[longspear]]s, and followed up their assault with talons and teeth.

==History==
The [[illithid]] [[Vestress]], queen of [[Ascarle]] in [[1361 DR]], had a standing army with a core of 100 merrow under her command.

==Society==
Merrow territories usually encompassed an area with a radius between {{SIrange|10|15|miles|long=yes}}. A chieftain ruled the tribe, and his power-hungry orders dictated the life of the members.
===Diet===
Merrow were a carnivorous species with voracious appetites, preying on all who entered their territory.
===Homelands===
Merrow lived in shallow freshwater caves about {{SIrange|50|250|ft}} below the surface. In [[Cormanthor]], they could be found in the [[River Ashaba]].<ref>

===Religions===
Some merrow worshiped [[Panzuriel]] and served him as [[shaman]]s.
===Relationships===
Merrow sometimes kept company with [[scrag]]s.

==Notable Merrows==
* [[Tarag]]
