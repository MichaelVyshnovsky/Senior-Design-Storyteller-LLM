Monitor lizards were a species of large carnivorous reptiles.
These lizards could be aggressive, using their jaws to attack enemies or tear at prey. 
Many monitor lizards were quite capable swimmers and silent stalkers.
These creatures could be found in northwest Faerûn, in the swamp known as the Mere of Dead Men, as well as the Eastern Shaar of southeast Faerûn.
Monitor lizards were sometimes tamed by troglodytes for use as guard animals of their warrens.
During the mid–14 century DR, the  Ginger Palace on the Dragon Coast boasted an outdoor reptile park that was home to several monitor lizards.
