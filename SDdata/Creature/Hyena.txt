A hyena was a type of pack animal known for its shrewdness and hunting skills and for its disturbing laugh-like call.
Hyenas came in different varieties but commonly had stripes on their fur, weighing about 120 pounds (55 kilograms) and measuring a about a yard (meter) in length. Their fur coloration gave them an advantage when hiding within areas of tall grass.
Hyenas fought in packs and were intelligent enough to send some of the members to circle and flank their prey. They were capable of tripping with their sharp jaws.

Gnolls, unsurprisingly, had a strong affinity for hyenas, keeping many as pets or guards. The Mulhorandi god Set also favored hyenas, using them as omens for his followers.
In the Shining South hyenas were known to be found in and around the Channath Vale, Dambrath, Durpar, Estagund, the Gnollwatch Mountains, the Great Rift, and the Shaar. North of this region, they could be found wandering the Raurin desert.
Hyena ears were valued among alchemists and a single year was valued at 5 gold pieces. Hyena ears were burned into ashes and hyena earwax made the ashes into unpleasant sticky goo. This ash good could be mixed with a special type of alchemical salt to create a potion of speed.
