A '''hyena''' was a type of pack [[animal]] known for its shrewdness and hunting skills and for its disturbing laugh-like call.

==Description==
Hyenas came in different varieties but commonly had stripes on their fur, weighing about 120 pounds (55 kilograms) and measuring a about a yard (meter) in length. Their fur coloration gave them an advantage when hiding within areas of tall grass.

==Combat==
Hyenas fought in packs and were intelligent enough to send some of the members to circle and flank their prey. They were capable of tripping with their sharp jaws.

==Reputation==

[[Gnoll]]s, unsurprisingly, had a strong affinity for hyenas, keeping many as pets or guards. The [[Mulhorand]]i god [[Set]] also favored hyenas, using them as omens for his followers.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|14}}

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
In the [[Shining South]] hyenas were known to be found in and around the [[Channath Vale]], [[Dambrath]], [[Durpar]], [[Estagund]], the [[Gnollwatch Mountains]], the [[Great Rift]], and [[the Shaar]]. North of this region, they could be found wandering the [[Raurin]] desert.

===Usages===
Hyena ears were valued among [[alchemist]]s and a single year was valued at 5 [[gold]] pieces. Hyena ears were burned into ashes and hyena earwax made the ashes into unpleasant sticky goo. This ash good could be mixed with a special type of alchemical [[salt]] to create a ''[[potion of speed]]''.
