        "mainbody": "Needle blights were medium-sized blights spawned from a Gulthias tree.\nNeedle blights looked enough like a hunched humanoid to be mistaken for one in the shadows of a forest, but a closer look made their plant-like nature obvious. Conifer-like needles grew in clumps across their bodies, and their gait was best described as shuffling.\nNeedle blights, like the rest of their foul kin, were evil-hearted, malevolent creatures.\nNeedle blights possessed blindsight only, and could understand Common but did not speak- as plants, they lacked eyes and a mouth. They were, however, capable of flinging the needles from their bodies as short-ranged projectiles.\nWhen a needle blight detected a potential threat, it released a particular pollen into the air. This pollen carried to and was detected by other needle blights who, alerted to the location of the threat, would swarm in from all sides.\nNeedle blights attacked with their clawed hands and the needles that grew on them.\nLike most other blights, needle blights were found in forests.\nNeedle blights were known to inhabit the Quivering Forest as of the 15 century DR."
