        "mainbody": "Crag cats, sometimes called \"Hunters-of-Men\", were predators that were well adapted to almost all terrains.\nCrag cats were grey during most of the year, but they turned white during the winter to better hide in the snow.\nThe cry of a crag cat resembled a scream of terror in order to attract humans.\nCrag cats had extraordinary resistance to magic and were capable of reflecting spells back to their casters.\nCrag cats were well adapted to any terrain, except for dense forests. They were often solitary, but could also be found in packs and family groups with their cubs. These packs were particularly dangerous during harsh winters.\n*Circa 1372 DR, Agar, a powerful half-orc fighter at the underground Gauntlet in Neverwinter, often went into battle accompanied by his pet crag cat."
