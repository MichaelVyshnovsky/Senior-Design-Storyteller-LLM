The yenth were a species of fish that could be found in the Sword Coast.
These fish had bronze scales, were about the size of a human palm, and resembled a smallmouth bass.
Yenth were considered to be quite tasty. They were commonly found for sale in the fish markets of Waterdeep during the winter season.
