'''Dinosaurs''', also known as '''thunderers''', '''behemoths''' ({{Pronounce|bee|HEM|uth|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}|audio=Behemoth1.ogg}} {{Pronounce|bee|HEE|muth|refs=|alt=yes|audio=Behemoth2.ogg}}), or '''garuda''',<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/121/The Living Jungle Just Got Livelier|3}} were a group of ancient reptilian creatures found on [[Toril]]. They were considered agents and children of the [[Chult]]an deity [[Ubtao]], though some of them had turned rogue to serve his enemy [[Eshowdow]].<ref>

==Description==
Dinosaurs came in many shapes and sizes, though, as the name "behemoth" implied, the best known were typically very large. They could be either herbivorous or carnivorous, depending on the species. Unlike dragons, dinosaurs were incapable of speech and were non-intelligent by nature.

Dinosaurs came in many varieties, from small to large, but most shared a number of physical features. They were, for instance, all covered in a layer of pebble-like skin. Most also demonstrated a well-developed sense of smell, which predatory behemoths used to hunt.  Many were also herbivorous.

==Behavior==
[[File:Dino chult.png|thumb|''Dinosaurs were one of Chult's dangers.'']]
Like dragons, predatory dinosaurs had a powerful lust to hunt, their razor-sharp teeth suitable for rending prey apart and were also highly territorial. Herbivorous dinosaurs were usually less aggressive, although, when defending their young or wounded or after being startled or irritated, they could be vicious enemies.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Dinosaurs often lived in areas very much isolated from humanoid habitation. They usually were found in remote mountain valleys, isolated rocky plateaus, dense tropical island forests, or secluded in the deepest and darkest of the jungles.

===Location===
Dinosaurs were known to exist on Toril in [[Chult]] and [[Malatra]].{{Cite living jungle/Living Jungle Campaign: Player Information Guide|2}} They could also be found on the island of [[Lurath]], by way of time portals into Toril's distant past.<ref>

==History==

It was widely believed by scholars from [[Candlekeep]] that dinosaurs existed in Toril since before the time period known as the [[Days of Thunder]]. In those ancients times, various species of dinosaur thrived until a cataclysm changed the world so drastically that most of them went extinct.

Sages from Candlekeep didn't have a unified theory about the nature of the catastrophe. The most commonly accepted theory proclaimed this catastrophe was the [[Tearfall]], while detractors of this theory believed that the [[The sun|sun]] temperatures diminished to a degree that produced a global climatic change so harsh that only the smallest dinosaurs were able to survive. A lunatic sage even proclaimed the cataclysm was actually a [[Dawn War|war]] between the gods and their enemies.

Whatever the truth, only a handful of dinosaurs, among them the [[proto-dragon]]s, were able to survive and evolve into the members of the species that existed in the [[Era of Upheaval|present age]].

There were multiple species of dinosaur, some of which are listed below, alongside other similar reptilian beasts.

; [[Allosaurus]]
:A large, strong, fast predator. It used its claws to pin down its prey.
;[[Altispinax]]
:A strong carnivorous creature that could be confused with stegosaurus due to their bone spines. They were an elusive species but could be found in Chultan swamps.
;[[Anatotitan]]
:A species of herbivorous dinosaur with a duck-like mouth, they were timid and easily frightened.
;[[Ankylosaurus]]
:Also known as '''macetail behemoths'''. Armored herbivores that had either knobbed or spiked tail tips that they used to defend from predators. Extremely territorial dinosaurs.
;[[Brachiosaurus]]
:Massive herbivores that resemble brontosaurus, but are much larger and with a bump on their heads.
;[[Brontosaurus]]
:Massive herbivores that used their tails as whips to defend from predators.
;[[Ceratosaur]]us
:A large, carnivorous variety of dinosaur marked by a horn-like ridge along its snout.
;[[Deinonychus]]
:Small, predatory dinosaurs roughly the size of [[human]]s that were highly social.
;[[Dimetrodon]]
:Medium-sized predators with sailed backs.
;[[Elasmosaurus]]
:An aquatic reptile roughly fifty feet in length, much of which was from its extremely long neck and serpentine tail.
;[[Hadrosaurus]]
:Herbivores with bony head crests that could walk as quadrupeds or as bipeds. They could be raised to work as mounts.
;[[Iguanodon]]
:Herbivores who have spikes on their thumbs, they could walk either as quadrupeds or bipeds.
;[[Megaraptor]]
:Superficially similar to deinonychus, though much larger, megaraptors were notable for their large hand claws.
;[[Monoclonius]]
:Herbivores who resemble triceratops, however with only one horn.
;[[Plesiosaurus]]
:Marine carnivorous reptiles with compact bodies and long necks.
;[[Pteranodon]]
:An enormous flying reptile that fed primarily on fish.
;[[Quetzalcoatlus]]
:Giant flying reptiles, related to the pteranodon.
;[[Stegosaurus]]
:Also known as '''bloodspike behemoths'''. Herbivorous dinosaurs marked by large plates resting along their spine and a notoriously bad temper.
;[[Styracosaurus]]
:Herbivores who resemble triceratops, however with only one horn and a spiked frill.
;[[Triceratops]]
:Short-tempered and aggressive even for a herbivore, triceratops were recognizable by their three horns and armored head.
;[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus Rex]]
: Among the largest predatory dinosaurs, tyrannosaurus was both a predator and a scavenger.
;[[Velociraptor]]
:Small feathered predators that hunted in packs for larger prey.
