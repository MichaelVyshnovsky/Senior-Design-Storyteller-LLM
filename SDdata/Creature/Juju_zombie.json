        "Description": "A typical juju zombie resembled an ordinary zombie, with its flesh gray, leathery and hard. The monster's eyes communicated its desire to destroy all things living. Created by potent magics, they were stronger, faster, and more cunning than the basic shambling corpse.",
        "Behavior": "Unlike a normal zombie, juju zombies retained their consciousness and the awareness of their [[undead]] state made them horribly vicious and cruel.",
        "Combat": "A juju zombie could use tools, use throwing weapons, as well as bows and crossbows. Jujus partially existed on the [[Negative Material Plane]] making them only vulnerable to magical weapons. These zombies were also immune to mind-affecting spells, illusion, poison, electricity, ''[[magic missile|magic missiles]]'', death, and cold spells. They also had resistance to fire.\nJujus could understand language and take commands, they preferred simple tactics and strategies in combat. They were dexterous enough to easily scale and climb walls with ease.{{Cite book/Monstrous Compendium Volume One\n|144}}",

            "Creation": "One of the ways to create a juju zombie required a ''[[create undead]]'' spell cast by a powerful spellcaster or the touch of the [[blightspawn|blightspawned]].",

            "Relationships": "Due to their cruel and vicious nature juju zombies were popular among [[Red Wizards]] and could be found in greater numbers in [[Thay]]."
