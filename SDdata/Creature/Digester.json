        "Description": "These creatures stood on average {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in height upon two powerful hind legs and weighed around {{SI|350|lb|k|long=yes}}. Their bodies sported a long tail, had a grey pebbly hide with [[dagger]]-like markings that helped them to camouflaged, and overall measured {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} in length. Their heads were narrow with sucking mouths and sported a tube-like orifice on their forehead.",
        "Behavior": "Digesters had a ravenous appetite, rarely feeling full, but when they were the beasts laid low and tried to avoid other creatures.",
        "Abilities": "Digesters were capable of seeing in both areas of [[low-light vision|low-light]] and [[darkvision|total darkness]]. They were also impervious to harm from [[acid]].\n\nThese creatures were capable of shooting acid from the tube-like they sported on their foreheads, either spraying it out in a cone of roughly {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} or as a concentrated stream out to {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}. Once a digester used this function they had to wait some time before they could spray again.",
        "Combat": "When a digester spotted a likely target they would charge at them and spray their acid. If they found that was not sufficient to kill their prey, a digester would then attack with their hind legs until they were able to use their acid spray once more.",
        "History": "Around [[1372 DR]], a digester roamed the valley of [[High Thorog]] after having been freed from [[Telkoun's Tower]].\n\nA year later, it was found that [[Quon's shop]] in [[Zhentil Keep]] held a digester in its kennels.<ref>",
