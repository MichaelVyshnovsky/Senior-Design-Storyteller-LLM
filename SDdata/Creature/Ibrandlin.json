        "text": "The presence of \"feral\" ibrandlin in Thar has evidently come to the attention of the priests of Ibrandul. I learned of the interest in the ibrandlin from a fellow caravan guard who claimed to be a worshiper of Ibrandul. His tales of the creatures' presence in Thar made their way to several high priests who served the god in a secret temple complex located in the Underdark. According to my fellow guardsman, these priests began making plans for an expedition to the region, intending to study and, if possible, re-domesticate the ibrandlin of Thar.",
        "mainbody": "Ibrandlin were first created by priests of Ibrandul using secrets passed to them by their [[god]], including special breeding techniques and spells. They spent centuries struggling to create creatures that could propogate themselves, but did not succeed until the death of their deity at the hands of [[Shar]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. As Shar had absorbed Ibrandul's [[portfolio|divine portfolio]], it was ultimately her influence that allowed for the perfection of these beasts. By the 1370s DR, their numbers were growing rapidly.\n\nIt was unknown as to how the ibrandlin came to be so numerous in the aboveground realm of Thar. Ogre-made stelae within the region depicted humanoid priests (presumably faithful of Ibrandul) summoning the massive beasts to kill helpless ogres, and their legends spoke of the human hero [[Beldoran]] who slew the last [[Tharkul]].",
        "Description": "The ibrandlin were massive creatures that resembled wingless, gray-scaled [[red dragon]]s with red and black bellies. While the surface-dwelling ibrandlin of Thar maintained an aversion to sunlight and kept themselves in whatever dark caves they could find, they adapted to the harsh life of living in such barren terrain. Having previously been domesticated in the [[Underdark]], they had become a more bestial, even feral species when living in the wild.",
        "Behavior": "Ibrandlin were trained from birth to respect and protect anyone wearing the dark purple vestments of Ibrandul or carrying his symbol (four interlocked silver circles),",
        "Combat": "Due to their size, ibrandlin were inherently dangerous, and surprisingly speedy creatures. They were known to rear up on their immensely strong tails and come crashing down on their foes, pinning them to the ground and raking them with all four of their massive claws while simultaneously biting with their forceful jaws.\n\nIbrandlin possessed the ability to breathe fire.\n\nIbrandlin would obey simple commands given to them by priests of Ibrandul.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Ibrandlin preferred to feed on livestock and herd animals, such as [[goat]]s, [[deer]], [[antelope]], and [[cow]]s. In th wild, it was not unheard of them to attack orcs and [[human]]s, as well as any accompanying [[horse]]s or pack animals they kept. They were physically incapable of getting [[disease|sick]] or [[poison]]ed from something they ate, and were thus captive ibrandlin were often fed meat that was otherwise not safe for consumption.",
            "Language": "While ibrandlin were not particularly intelligent, they could speak in broken [[Draconic language|Draconic]].",
            "Life Cycle": "Originally, ibrandlin were created directly by priests of Ibrandul, who would create them from [[fire lizard]]s using special breeding techniques and the ''[[create ibrandlin]]'' spell. While these artifical ibrandlin could mate, their offspring were normal fire lizards. Only in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] did they successfully manage to breed ibrandlin which could produce ibrandlin offspring.\n\nA mating pair of ibrandlin would breed once a year, with a female laying a clutch of about a dozen eggs within their nest. After the eggs hatched in spring, Hatchlings were a light gray color, and their scales darkened as they aged. Captive ibrandlin hatchlings were removed from their parents to be trained, while wild ones sought out their own lairs with plentiful hunting grounds once they grew from juveniles into adults.",
            "Uses": "The [[church of Ibrandul]] jealously guarded their control over the ibrandlin as their guardians and protectors, and would hunt down anyone who acquired one of their eggs or hatchlings. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, eggs sold for around 5,500 [[gold pieces]] while hatchlings went for [[8,000]] gold pieces."
