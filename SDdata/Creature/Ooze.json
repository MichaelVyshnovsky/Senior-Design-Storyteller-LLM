        "mainbody": "An ooze was a category of creatures that generally resembled amorphous blobs and mostly dwelt underground. This category of creatures included slimes, jellies and puddings and amorphous creatures.\nBeing a diverse array of creatures, oozes exhibited varying degrees of \"sentience\". some like the mustard jelly had intellects comparable to humans.\nThey were essentially blind, but more than made up for that with an ability called blindsight, allowing them to discern nearby objects and creatures without needing to see them. Most oozes secreted an acid from their skin that dissolved flesh and other materials rapidly. They had a unique tendency to resist close-range and melee attacks by dissolving the wielders weapon slowly.\nThere were many types of oozes, the names often interchangeable with jellies and slimes.\nThe Demonomicon of Iggwilv was one of the sources that claimed that oozes originated as fragments of the offspring of Juiblex, who was the only known being capable of controlling oozes and of granting them a glimmer of intelligence and tactics.\nSometime in the late 1480s DR numerous oozes of various types were drawn to Blingdenstone under the auspices of the Pudding King."
