        "mainbody": "'''Topaz dragons''' were a breed of [[gem dragon]] known to be selfish and unsociable and for their similarity to [[topaz]].",
        "Description": "When a [[wyrmling]], a topaz dragon had scales that were dull yellow with orange highlights. while they brightened in color, with individual scales becoming indiscernible. and sparkled under the sun and from far off they appeared as if carved from pure topaz. Conversely, their pupils faded with age, so a [[great wyrm]]'s eyes were naught but fiery glowing orbs.\n\nA hatchling had a {{SIAdj|2|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} body and {{SIAdj|2|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} tail, while an adult had a body length of {{SIrange|44|53|ft|long=yes}} and a tail length of {{SIrange|23|29|ft|long=yes}}. The biggest great wyrms grew to {{SI|92|ft|long=yes}} long in the body, with tails {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} long.",
        "Personality": "While not really malevolent, they were selfish and unfriendly, with no interest in meeting others or in having others meet them. They often behaved erratically and this made them unpleasant and even dangerous to deal with.",
        "Abilities": "Topaz dragons breathed a cone of dehydration, ironically resembling a blast of water. or {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} long and up to {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} wide. Living creatures caught in the blast would be severely dehydrated,\n\nTopaz dragons were naturally immune to [[:category:cold spells|cold spells]] and could breathe water as well as they could air.\n\nLike any dragon, and in addition to the common powers of gem dragons, topaz dragons gained an array of magical powers as they aged, though accounts of these varied. Alternatively, adults could create a ''[[fog cloud]]'' thrice a day, old dragons could ''[[control winds]]'' thrice a day, and ancient dragons could ''[[control weather]]'' once a day. If psionic, juveniles could ''[[featherfall]]'', old dragons could ''[[control air]]'' rather than ''control winds'', and great wyrms could ''[[shape change]]''.\n\nSimilarly, topaz dragons could acquire and cast new [[spell]]s of their own, whether arcane or divine, but they were most noted for their talent in [[psionics]]. Those who were so gifted learned the psionic attacks ''[[mind thruster]]'' and ''[[id insinuation]]'' or ''[[ego whip]]'' and the psionic defenses ''[[mind blank (psionic)|mind blank]]'' or ''[[thought shield]]'' and ''[[mental barrier]]''.\n\nThey were skilled in swimming, hiding, and survival.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Occupying the same or similar environments, topaz dragons and [[bronze dragon]]s regularly quarreled. Their battles were invariably violent and lethal.",
            "Lairs": "Topaz dragons made their lairs by the sea, in bleak and rocky coastal areas such as secluded beaches, caves above or below the waterline, or structures they built themselves.\n\nIn spite of this, topaz dragons did not actually enjoy the water as their bronze dragon neighbors did. In fact, they had little liking of it and swam only as necessary for hunting and battle. They kept their lairs scrupulously dry,",
            "Lands": "Topaz dragons were most often found in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]., and they only made short visits to the [[Prime Material Plane]].\n\nIn the [[Unapproachable East]], topaz dragons could be found around the coastal regions of [[Aglarond]].<ref>\n\nTopazes were among the different kinds of dragon known to lair near the [[Smokeholes]] for their warmth, at least temporarily while travelling over the [[High Ice]].{{ Cite book/Elminster's Ecologies/Anauroch|20}}"
        },
        "Tactics": "While they did not like visitors or trespassers to their lairs, topaz dragons also did not like fighting. In fact, while they avoided conversing at the best of times, they would do so to prevent a fight and to conceal their magical and psionic preparations. When trespassers proved hostile, or just uninteresting or annoying, the topaz dragon would strike first if it could. If outside, it would use its powers to control wind and weather, before entering melee. If inside, it often began with its dehydrating breath instead.\n\nIf outmatched, a topaz dragon might propose or pretend to surrender to buy itself time, and if overwhelmed it would retreat. However, some retreats were feigned, and the topaz dragon would return to surprise its attacker.",
        "Usage": "A talon of a topaz dragon was reported to be one of many draconic [[material component]]s in [[Ossavitor's Way]], a magical means by which a [[dragon]] could attain immortality.{{Cite dragon/237/Wyrms of the North: Eldenser}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Eldenser, \"The Worm Who Hides in Blades\"}}\n\nThe brain and/or cranial fluids of a topaz dragon was one proposed ingredient in the long-sought-after [[universal material component]].<ref>",
