        "mainbody": "Podokesaurus () was a species of dinosaur.\nPodokesaurs were small and looked like their cousins compsognathus.\nPodokesaurs were agile predators, striking first and fast. They hunted in packs and a pack of pdokesaurs were able to bring down larger prey.\nPodokesaurs were most often encountered in forests and plains. \nPodokesaurs were carnivores and lived, and hunted, in packs. If food was scarce, it was not uncommon for podokesaurs to resort to cannibalism, eating weaker members of their pack."
