        "mainbody": "'''Merchurions''' were rarely encountered, hulking [[humanoid]]-shaped [[living construct]]s of liquified metal.",
        "Description": "These constructs had well muscled, silvery forms that flowed and shifted like liquid and had a metallic sheen. On average they stood {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|12|tons|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "Merchurions were disdainful of all other creatures, but especially [[true giant]]s, and thus tended to have a [[chaotic evil]] alignment. They were virtually impossible to negotiate with, granting no quarter in combat. They harbored a deep sense of shame of the failure and subsequent punishment that led to their creation.",
        "Abilities": "Merchurions possessed all the traits common of living constructs, though their eyes could see [[darkvision]] and [[low-light vision]].\n\nMerchurions had the ability to spontaneously generate weapons from their bodies. These weapons were always [[silver]]ed and had a ''+3 enhancement''. Whatever weapon they generated, a merchurion would be proficient in its use. If the weapon ever left their hands, it would melt away into a pool of silver liquid.\n\nWhen struck by a [[magic item|magical weapon]] a merchurion would absorb all of its properties for a period of one hour. The weapon would lose these properties and in turn the merchurion could manifest them in its generated weapons, though the property had to be suitable to the weapon. They were also capable of giving up absorbed properties in order to allow themselves to absorb new ones.\n\nWhen slain a merchurion's body collapsed and melted away into a pool of silvery liquid, much like their weapons. Some of their magical essence was retained by the liquid, thus any weapon dipped into it would be permanently imbued with some fraction of magic in addition to becoming silvered. After a period of twenty four hours this liquid would evaporate harmlessly.",
        "Combat": "Confident in their abilities, merchurions always charged head first into combat and was liable to even bull rush through opponents. Whenever possible they tried to target opponents wielding magical weapons. They typically generated two-handed weapons to keep their close-quarter combatants at a distance and smaller weapons to fight in confined spaces.",
        "History": "One legend surrounding the [[deity]] [[Surtur]] tells of him tasking a group of [[fire giant]]s, masters at metalsmithing, to create a weapon that could surpass even the [[adamantine]] [[axe]]s of [[dwarves]]. After laboring for decades they produced only a strange [[slag]] of [[quicksilver]] and an enraged Surtur threw them into the magma rift that held their creation. Instead of dying, those fire giants were said to have emerged as living constructs of that same metal.\n\nSome time in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[adventurer]]s delving beneath the volcanic areas of [[Chult]] claimed to have encountered these same creatures. They further claimed that this group of creatures coveted metal and magic.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Despite being living constructs and therefore not requiring nourishment, merchurions mysteriously had a craving to devour metal. With their most preferred type being silver.",
            "Homelands": "Merchurions preferred warm climates and typically inhabited either the interiors of volcanic mountains or deep underground. Where they wandered or settled down for a time was largely driven by their craving for metal.",
            "Relationships": "Merchurions viewed all races but fire giants as inferior to themselves, with the latter being seen enviously as the chosen of Surtur. Though because of the deep sense of shame they harbored, encounters with them generally turned to bloodshed."
