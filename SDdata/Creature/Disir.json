        "mainbody": "'''Disir''' were unsightly slime-covered creatures found in the subterranean depths of [[Underdark]]'s overpopulated areas, led by a disir queen.",
        "Description": "An average disir stood between {{SI|6'|'\"|long=yes}} and {{SI|7'|'\"|long=yes}}, weighting around {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}}. The creature spent most of their lives hunched over, appearing shorter than their true height. Disir bodies were partially protected by natural chitinous armor while leaving parts of the rubbery green-white skin exposed. Disir constantly secreted green slime from the pores, coating their bodies in a gel-like substance. The slime collected dirt, dead flesh, and other rubbish in the wild, bringing forth a strong stench of decay.\n\nThe disir species did not have sexual dimorphism, making males and females appear virtually identical.",
        "Abilities": "The slime that coated disir's body and claws was [[poison]]ous but not deadly and when introduced into an open wound, caused immense pain. The infection of burning pain spread from the wound, and its intensity paralyzed affected muscles. The same thick poisonous coating protected the creatures from fire.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Disir ADnDTCG.png|thumb|''A slimy disir.'']]\nDisir's bite and claws were its main weapon; however, some were known to use weapons. These creatures preferred to rent their opponents with claws and only use bites to finish off enemies or to kill defenseless prey. Disir claws were powerful enough to crush stone, and their terrifying protruding jagged fangs, as well as razor-sharp tongues that had the texture of a rasp, were perfectly suitable to separate living flesh from bone.",
        "Society": "Disir colonies were rarely seen by inhabitants of [[Toril]]. Their communities had a tribal structure. Each tribe consisted of fifty or more closely associated disir, and more than one tribe could inhabit the same area. It was believed that disir tribes never came into conflict. However, they saw all other creatures and humanoids as food sources. Despite their high intelligence, disir never allied or negotiated with other species.\n\nDisir were egg-laying species that changed their sex as they moved through life. Disir had a matriarchal society. Those disir who were in their female phase were the dominant individuals within the tribe. All duties were shared between the tribe's adults, including maternal tasks of nurturing and guarding tribe incubators where the disir eggs were laid, as well as disir larval young. Raids and hunts were done by all adults as well, and the food and other loot recovered from such raids were equally distributed among the tribe members. However, those adults who were unable to perform all of the tasks were killed.\n\nTribes were led by a disir queen and some had elite warriors, [[rogue]]s, and [[shaman]]s. Disir spoke their own [[Disir language|language]] and could speak [[Common]]. Some also were known to speak [[Dwarvish]], [[Goblin language|Goblin]], or [[Ogre language|Ogrish]].",

            "Usages": "Disir slime consul not be bottled to be used for its poisonous properties as it lost potency swiftly after being secreted and exposed to air."
