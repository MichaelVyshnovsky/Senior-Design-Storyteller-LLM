        "Description": "Like beholders, gougers were spherical, but some {{SI|10|ft}} in diameter; they had ten eyestalks as well as four short legs. Most horribly, they had {{SIAdj|15|ft|adj=long}} spiked tongues. They twitched and shrieked constantly.",
        "Personality": "Created as weapons, gougers were mad, ruthless, and lacking in self-preservation instincts. They hated and feared their masters, but refused to cooperate with anyone else.",
        "Abilities": "The eyestalks of gougers lacked any magical abilities, though the central eye retained the infamous antimagic cone power of beholders. Like beholders, gougers naturally flew, although their legs meant that they could walk, albeit slowly and clumsily.",
        "Combat": "Gougers fought with their tongues, and were skilled at taking out the eyes of other beholders and beholderkin in such a manner.",
        "Ecology": "Gougers were carnivorous and dwelled underground, primarily in the [[Underdark]].",
        "History": "Gougers were originally created as slaves by the phaerimm trapped below the [[Anauroch]], but were less than useful until a trio of free phaerimm, the [[Triumvirate]], conquered Ooltul and fought against the beholders and beholder mages there. They retrieved the process and made more gougers, turning them against the beholders, but did not bother to keep tight rein on their slaves."
