'''Elemental vermin''' were small natives of the [[elemental planes]] but could also be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

They were simple pests on their native elemental planes, but carried the potential for wreaking havoc in Zakhara.

==Description==
There were four varieties of elemental vermin, one for each of the four primary elements:

* [[Duster]]s ([[Air]])
* [[Crawler]]s ([[Earth (element)|Earth]])
* [[Flameling]]s ([[Fire]])
* [[Spitter]]s ([[Water]])

==Habitat==
These creatures entered Zakhara through magical [[gate]]s. They were always found in areas that presented high concentrations of their native element or areas where [[genie]]s and [[elemental]]s were more common.

They could often be found lurking around the dock areas and warehouses of [[Huzuz]].

==Ecology==
Elemental vermin were scavengers on their home planes. However, within Zakhara they consumed things that were prized by civilized society including [[perfume]], [[gem]]s, [[silk]], and [[wine]].
