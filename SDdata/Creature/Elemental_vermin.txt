Elemental vermin were small natives of the elemental planes but could also be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
They were simple pests on their native elemental planes, but carried the potential for wreaking havoc in Zakhara.
There were four varieties of elemental vermin, one for each of the four primary elements
* Dusters (Air)
* Crawlers (Earth)
* Flamelings (Fire)
* Spitters (Water)
These creatures entered Zakhara through magical gates. They were always found in areas that presented high concentrations of their native element or areas where genies and elementals were more common.
They could often be found lurking around the dock areas and warehouses of Huzuz.
Elemental vermin were scavengers on their home planes. However, within Zakhara they consumed things that were prized by civilized society including perfume, gems, silk, and wine.
