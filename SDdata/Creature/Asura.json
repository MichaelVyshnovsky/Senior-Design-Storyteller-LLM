They preferred to attack their opponents from the air, causing terrible wounds by claws and hand-held weapons. Being one of the wisest creatures in the [[outer planes]], they were immune to many forms of [[enchantment]] and were completely protected from [[illusion]]s. Thanks to their marvelous vision, an asura could easily recognize lies and punish the guilty. Asuras could also transform into a [[human]] or [[demihuman]] to go unnoticed. In this case, their abilities were retained.",
