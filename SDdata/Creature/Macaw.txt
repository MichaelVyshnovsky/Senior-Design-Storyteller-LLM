'''Macaw''' was a species of a loud and brightly-colored [[parrot]] found in the jungles and hot humid forests in [[South Faerûn]] and on the continent of [[Maztica]].

==Description==
Macaws were renowned for their loud colors and the ability to memorize and imitate [[humanoid]] speech. Like other parrots, they had strong claws and beaks used for climbing and their toes allowed the birds to handle small objects.{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|16}}

==Ecology==
The macaw diet consisted of fruits, nuts, and a small quantity of meat.

In Maztica, locals often trained a number of exotic beasts. Parrots and macaws were among the most common. Their brightly colored feathers were used in the region's unique ''[[pluma]]'' magic. The more colorful the feather was, the more valuable it was to a pluma-user. Macaw plumage was gathered from birds caught by masterfully-crafted snares after the hunters quickly wrung their necks. These feathers were used by crafters to weave bright and brilliant macaw cloaks for Maztican nobles.

''Pluma'' spells of ''[[bird charm II]]'' could be used to tame and command Maztican birds, including macaws.

===Habitats===
In the [[Shining South]], macaws and other parrots swarmed the [[Forest of Amtar]] in [[Dambrath]].

Domesticated macaws could be found in the ancient city of [[Cursrah]] in the [[Calim Caliphates]].

Beyond [[Prime Material plane]], macaws inhabited the jungle [[Domains of Dread|Domais of Dread]] – [[Sri Raji]].<ref>{{Cite book| author = William W.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, a Maztican deity [[Qotal]] used talking macaws to guide his chosen [[cleric]] [[Erixitl]] during the period of war between the conquistadors of [[Amn]] and the men of the [[True World]], corrupted by [[Lolth]]'s shadowy manipulations and the cruel god of war [[Zaltec]].
