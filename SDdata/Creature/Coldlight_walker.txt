'''Coldlight walkers''' were a type of [[undead]] found in cold regions.

==Description==
Since a coldlight walker was an undead [[humanoid]]'s corpse, the appearance of this creature varied. It was usually encountered still wearing the clothes it was wearing at the time of its death. Its main distinguishing feature was the incredibly bright light emitted from within its body.

==Behavior==
Coldlight walkers had a powerful loathing of all living things.

==Abilities==
Coldlight walkers had a natural immunity to the cold. They had some natural immunity to magic, being immune to charm, paralyzation, petrification, and [[poison]]-based effects and spells, as well as spells that blinded or exhausted a target. 

The light emitted by a coldlight walker was so bright it could temporarily blind a creature, and brightened an area of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} around the undead creature. Coldlight walkers had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[cold ray]]'' spell.

==Combat==
If a creature was killed by a coldlight walker, its corpse became frozen solid for over a week. This frozen corpse could not be thawed by heat nor raised.

==Ecology==
Coldlight walkers were the reanimated corpses of humanoids who died from exposure to the cold. Certain gods sometimes created coldlight walkers to remind the living of the power and wrath of winter. When a coldlight walker was killed, its remains could not be reanimated once again.
