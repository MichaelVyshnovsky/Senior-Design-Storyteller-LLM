        "mainbody": "Devil dogs were a rare species of arctic canine.\nThese canines had stark-white fur, blue eyes, and on average grew to be  tall at the shoulder. When not within  of them, their white fur made it difficult to perceive a devil dog in areas covered by frost or snow.\nDevil dogs had an average level of intelligence.\nDevil dogs were capable of running at very fast speeds and could emit intense barks that triggered an effect similar to fear in their enemies.\nThese canines regularly resorted to lunging for the throats of their enemies.\nIn the month of Uktar, 1358 DR, the cities of Silverymoon and Sundabar had to fend off attacks from huge packs of devil dogs in addition to packs of winter wolves and bands of frost giants.\nDevil dogs traveled in packs.\nDevils dogs were a carnivorous species. They were especially known to attack groups of humans.\nThese creatures were only known to inhabit regions with cold climates."
