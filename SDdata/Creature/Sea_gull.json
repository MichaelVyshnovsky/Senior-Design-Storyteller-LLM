        "Description": "These birds measured around {{SIrange|1.5|2|ft|long=yes}} in length, from beak to tail, and had wingspans of {{SIrange|4|5.5|ft|long=yes}}. Their feathers were typically white, though some had a black coloration.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:The Silent Blade - Clyde Caldwell.jpg|thumb|273px|''A gull squawks in Luskan'']]\nGulls were skilled at flying long distances over water, but were not that agile. They were capable of swimming, but only on the surface level of water.",
        "History": "In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[Cormyrean Freesails|Cormyrean freesailor]] by the name of [[Dalvar Corzon]] worked to domesticate many of the sea gulls that inhabited the coast of [[Cormyr]] and carefully train them to carry messages, much like the [[carrier pigeon]]s that were used in [[Waterdeep]]. He only had limited success in this endeavor, though some of his sea gulls managed to deliver messages that proved critical to Cormyr's success during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] and the [[Horde War]] of [[1360 DR]].",
        "Sub-Species": {
            "Calathra": "A species of seagull that was indigenous to the [[Arnaden region]]. but much like the typical gull they were born with gray and white feathers. However, over time their feathers took on a green tinge due to their time spent in the [[Lake of Steam]].",
            "Gullion": "A species of seagull that had adapted to life in [[Wildspace]]."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Sea gulls ate a wide variety of food including carrion, [[fish]], [[snail]]s, [[worm]]s, and even some vegetables like [[turnip]]s, though their most preferred food was fish.",
            "Habitats": "[[File:Neverwinter seagull.jpg|thumb|''A greedy seagull in the harbors of [[Neverwinter]].'']]\nThese birds were typically found inhabiting areas within {{SI|50|miles|long=yes}} of any coastline and near any inland body of water. And in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], particularly large sea gulls could be found around the isle of [[Sumbar]].{{Cite dungeon/48/The Oracle at Sumbar|23-24}}\n\nIn [[north Faerûn]], these birds could be found around the coastal cities of [[Tantras]] and [[Ravens Bluff]], as well as [[Harrowdale]]'s small set of islands calld [[the Shoulder]]. However, they were largely absent from Ravens Bluff's [[Ravens Bluff/Mortonbrace|Mortonbrace]] neighborhood, owing to the area's very territorial [[raven]]s.\n\nIn [[West Faerûn|west]] and [[north Faerûn]], sea gulls could typically be found at any port along the normally temperate [[Sword Coast]], such as [[Waterdeep]]{{Cite web/theedverse/2018-11-17 - Wildlife of Waterdeep}} and [[Neverwinter]]. They could also be found around the coast of Cormyr. Further north, they could be encountered around the [[Great Glacier]].\n\nIn [[Kara-Tur]], these birds could be found in the region of [[Wa]], such as around the [[Paikai]] islands.\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], sea gulls could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]], particularly in [[Draga Salt-Biter]]'s domain of Saragoss. They could also be found in the [[plane]] of [[Acheron]].",
            "Relationships": "Sea gulls were [[favored animal]]s of the [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric deity]] [[Ramman]], as well as the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian powers]] [[Shaundakul]] and [[Valkur]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|14-15}} Shaundakul was known to send gulls to guide or aid his faithful. And Valkur [[specialty priest]]s, [[stormharbor]]s, often had a sea gull design embroidered on their outfits with gold thread in the belief that it would bring them good luck.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Paikai islands believed these birds to be representatives of the souls of the dead. They held an annual ceremony, called the [[Festival of Seagulls]], in which they would leave out plates of raw meat for them.\n\nIn the Shutters, one of the neighborhoods of Ravens Bluff's [[Ravens Bluff/Crow's End|Crow's End District]], impoverished children would often try to kill any sea gulls that swooped down by throwing sticks and stones at them. They would then bring the bird back to their homes to be made into food.\n\nIn the Great Glacier region, they were one of the many staple birds in the diet of [[Iulutiun]]s. And the inhabitants of [[Cragmyr]] would also supplement the [[chicken]]s they raised by [[sling]]ing down gulls.<ref name=\"drag200-p144>{{Cite dragon/200/Elminster's Notebook: Lord Kuldak Maurancz|144}}\n\nSome aquatic [[ranger]]s were known to have gulls as [[animal companion]]s. [[Mage]]s that practiced [[Sea (province)|sea magic]] often had them as [[familiar]]s{{Cite dragon/235/Mage on Deck!|32}} and used them as targets for the [[spell]] ''[[animal messenger]]''.{{Cite dragon/220/Arcane Lore: Sea Magic|72}} Those [[summon]]ed by the spell ''[[find familiar]]'' typically had black feathers and were in the larger range of size.{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|14}}",
            "Usages": "The feather of a seagull was used as a [[material component]] in the spell ''[[gullship]]''."

        "Trivia": "* Seagulls were one of many common species of bird that made warriors in [[Hlondeth]] uneasy.\n* Any [[humanoid]] that sat on the [[magic]]al [[granite]] throne inside [[Dangwaru]] could [[polymorph|transform]] themselves into a sea gull for a period of eight hours.\n* The ''[[staff of birdcalls]]'' allowed its wielder to mimic the call of a seagull."
