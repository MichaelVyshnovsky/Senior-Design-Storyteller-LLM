Herdsman genies were special tasked genies in Zakhara who tended animals.
Herdsmen were descendants of the jann.
These sociable genies were short and wiry with heavy brows. Years of sun exposure left their skin dark and tanned. Herdsman genies often smelled like their animals but with a slight rancid odor because of all of the milk products that they consumed.
These genies only entered combat for self defense or in defense of their herds. They were proficient with a variety of weaponry including short bows, spears, short swords, and lassos. They could use the following spell-like abilities phantom steed, dust devil, remove fear, and flame brand.
Herdsman genies were adept at firing bows from the back of a horse or camel while riding at full speed.
In desperate situations a herdsman genie would attempt to create a stampede and charge an enemy.
These genies were solitary unless a larger herd required assistance to manage. They would only disobey their masters if the safety of their herds was at stake.
Most of their diet consisted of blood carefully taken from their charges. Animal milk was used to make a wide variety of food as well.
Herdsman genies moved often if grazing was not suitable for their animals. They did not care for artificial boundaries created by humanoids, which often led them into conflicts.
