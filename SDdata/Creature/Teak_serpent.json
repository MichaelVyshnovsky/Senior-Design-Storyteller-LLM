        "Description": "Teak serpents could reach lengths exceeding {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. Their hardened scales resembled those of the hardwood trees they inhabited, providing them with protection and natural camouflage.",
        "Combat": "Teak serpents preferred to surprise their prey by dropping on it from above with a combined attack involving a bite and constriction. Given their size and strength a teak serpent was capable of constricting up to three [[human]]-sized creatures at the same time.",
        "Habitat/Society": "Teak serpents were feared predators in their natural habitats. Their preferred prey item was a baby [[elephant]], but they would consume anything they could overpower. They would typically sleep for a week after feeding.",
        "Ecology": "These serpents ate live prey appropriate for a snake of their size. Their scales were harvested to add protective bonuses to the ''[[barkskin]]'' spell. Teak serpents were also captured by [[kahin]]s and bound into [[Staff of the Teak Serpent|magical staves]]."
