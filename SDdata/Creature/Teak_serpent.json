        "mainbody": "Teak serpents, or teak snakes, were a type of huge constrictor snake found only in the vast jungles of the Cities of the Ancients region of east Zakhara, specifically in parts of the jungle with teak or ironwood trees.\nTeak serpents could reach lengths exceeding . Their hardened scales resembled those of the hardwood trees they inhabited, providing them with protection and natural camouflage.\nTeak serpents preferred to surprise their prey by dropping on it from above with a combined attack involving a bite and constriction. Given their size and strength a teak serpent was capable of constricting up to three human-sized creatures at the same time.\nTeak serpents were feared predators in their natural habitats. Their preferred prey item was a baby elephant, but they would consume anything they could overpower. They would typically sleep for a week after feeding.\nThese serpents ate live prey appropriate for a snake of their size. Their scales were harvested to add protective bonuses to the barkskin spell. Teak serpents were also captured by kahins and bound into magical staves."
