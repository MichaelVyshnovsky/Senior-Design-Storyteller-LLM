Devourers were fiends who acted in the service of Orcus. They were used to create armies of undead by consuming the bodies and souls of humanoids. Lesser demons could be promoted to devourers by proving themselves to Orcus.
Devourers were tall, gaunt skeletal figures with a smaller figure trapped within their rib cage.
Due to their fiendish nature, devourers did not require air, drink, sleep, or any sort of food beyond souls.
Devourers were able to create new undead by bringing a humanoid creature to the brink of death, then trapping it inside its rib cage. While there, the devourer tortured its victims soul with telepathic noise until death, after which it underwent a transformation into an undead servitor.
They could conjure some form of green energy from the souls of those they consumed and release it in concentrated blasts against their foes.
Devourers were never known to travel in groups.
Devourers were generally found in the Abyss, on the Astral plane, or the Ethereal plane pursuing the interests and schemes of Orcus. Those seen on the Material Plane were typically sent by Orcus to create and lead an army of undead.
Undead were naturally attracted to areas in which devourers existed. The types of undead typically known to be attracted to such areas included skeletons, zombies, ghouls, ghasts, and shadows.
