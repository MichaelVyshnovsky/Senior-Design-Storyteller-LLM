A '''d'hin'ni''' was a type of [[planetouched]] that was the combination of a [[genie]] ancestor and [[halfling]] (or [[hin]] as they were also called) blood.

==Personality==
Commonly descended from slave [[Lightfoot halfling|lightfoot hin]] and their [[djinn]] masters, they mixed the halfling's disinterest in the battles of morals and ethics, but the unpredictability of djinn caused the majority of them to take the [[chaotic neutral]] alignment.

==Description==
The outsider nature of planetouched caused a lot of variations of appearance, but the males were almost always bald while the women had long black hair. They were taller than their hin relatives, but not as tall as [[dwarves]]. They favored clothing of silk and cotton.

==History==
D'hin could trace their bloodlines back to [[Calim Empire]], which was ruled by djinn. When the genies were overthrown by what was to be the people of [[Coramshan]], the d'hin fled northward to avoid being persecuted by those who hated their genie blood. They moved to the [[Calishar Emirates]] with the great halfling migration. By the 14th century [[DR]], d'hin were common on the [[Sword Coast]] in halfling communities in [[Calimshan]], the [[Purple Hills]] of [[Tethyr]], the eastern shores of [[Lake Esmel]], the [[Sunset Vale]], and near [[Secomber]].

==Society==
They filled many roles in their communities, but had a strong bent to the [[arcane]] arts and many became [[sorcerer]]s. They tended to worship the same gods as their hin kin, but they especially loved [[Brandobaris]] and also surprisingly venerated the [[human]] god [[Shaundakul]]. They loved fine [[scimitar]]s, curved [[dagger]]s, clothing, and jewelry (especially earrings).
