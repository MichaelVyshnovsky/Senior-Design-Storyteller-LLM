        "mainbody": "'''Shifters''', also sometimes called the '''weretouched''', were a race of [[humanoid]]s descended from interbreeding between [[lycanthrope]]s and [[human]]s. Fierce and wild-spirited, shifters were feared by many as much as their shapeshifting brethren.",
        "Description": "Shifters resembled humans, their close brethren, but with distinctively bestial features such as sharp teeth, claws, pointed ears, or fur.\n\nHowever, to a human's eye, the resemblance was less obvious than the differences. Unlike humans, shifters had flat, animal-like noses, larger than usual eyes that allowed them to see better in low light, heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, skin that was often of a brownish shade, and much more hair, also commonly brown, than was typical for the common human.",
        "Lifespan": "Shifters lived about as long humans did on average.",
        "Personality": "Shifters were commonly self-reliant and free-spirited.",
        "Culture": {
            "Religion": "Shifters favored gods of nature, the moon, and primal strength."
        },
        "Homelands": "Just like lycanthropes, shifters could be found scattered throughout [[Faer√ªn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], but a few gathered in larger communities. The [[Werewoods]] near [[Baldur's Gate]] and the [[Glimmerwood]] in [[Luruar]] were two such locations where lycanthropes were found in larger numbers and hence, as a result, so were shifters. However, most shifters, even in these regions, stayed away from the dark influence of their ancestors. Other large shifter communities were found in the [[Great Dale]] and the [[Forest of Lethyr]], as well as [[Dambrath]], where the local culture was xenophobic and had a hatred for [[drow]].",
        "Subraces/Shifting Abilities": ";[[Longtooth shifter]]s\n:Longtooth shifters were athletic and durable, while remaining wise to the world around them.\n;[[Razorclaw shifter]]s\n:Razorclaw shifters were agile and subtle, with a high degree of perception to aid them in their hunts.\n;[[Cliffwalk shifter]]s\n:Cliffwalk shifters became agile and gained a much-improved climbing ability.\n;[[Beasthide shifter]]s\n:Beasthide shifters were tough and resilient, making them hard to bring down. While they shifted, they became tougher still.\n;[[Longstride shifter|Swiftstride shifter]]s\n:Swiftstride shifters became fleeter of foot and were able to increase their speed for a time while shifting.\n;[[Wildhunt shifter]]s\n:Wildhunt shifters gained the extraordinary ability to smell as well as a predatory animal, allowing them to track by scent, as well as increased resilience. Wildhunt shifters made for exceptional trackers thanks to their enhanced sense of smell.\n;[[Dreamsight shifter]]s\n:Dreamsight shifters were the rarest of all. While shifting, they gained a bonus to their Wisdom as well as the ability to speak with animals in a supernatural manner, increasing their ability to manage animals.\n;[[Gorebrute shifter]]s\n:Gorebrute shifters gained a pair of horns that could be used in a natural charge attack, as well as enhanced strength.\n\nA shifter could have all of these abilities and more, as they increased their shapeshifting powers.{{Fact}}"
