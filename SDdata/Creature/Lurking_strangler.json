        "Description": "Lurking stranglers were two disembodied eyeballs, connected by a {{SI|3'|'\"|long=yes}} long flexing and compressing strand of muscle fiber. An entire creature weighed around {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "Lurking stranglers could not speak but understood [[Beholder language|Beholder]] and [[Common]] languages. However, they did communicate via body movements. For example, a wide-open posture meant the creature complied or understood a command, while when a lurking strangler coiled in a spiral, it meant fear, stress, or dissent.",
        "Abilities": "Due to their biology, lurking stranglers were extremely perceptive creatures visually. They also flew thanks to their naturally buoyant bodies and were unable to fall out of the sky, slowly descending down instead, as if under the effects of the ''[[feather fall]]'' spell.",
        "Combat": "In battle, lurking stranglers primarily used eye rays. Despite being able to make lashing attacks with their sinus bodies, stranglers preferred to stay a safe distance away from the opponent. One of the eye rays fired from a distance put their foes to ''[[sleep]]'', after which lurking stranglers slithered to the slumbering victims and strangled them in sleep. The ''sleep'' ray had a great range of {{SI|130'|'\"|long=yes}}. The second eye's ray ''[[cause fear|caused fear]]'' with the range of {{SI|30'|'\"|long=yes}}.",
        "Ecology": "Lurking stranglers were pet creatures of sorts for [[gauth]]s and beholders. Lurking stranglers acred as companions and sometimes as spies for them. As such, any beholder enclaves usually included a number of lurking stranglers. The largest population of these aberrant creatures could be found in the Underdark city of [[Ooltul]] by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "It was believed that the first lurking stranglers appeared on [[Toril]] as magical spell experiments created by [[beholder mage]]s. and the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]]."
