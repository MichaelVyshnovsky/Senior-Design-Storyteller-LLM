        "mainbody": "half-troll was a sort of hybrid humanoid, classified as a giant, that was born through the union of a troll and another unrelated creature.\nDepending on their parentage, the appearance of a half-troll could vary. Typical features reflective of their troll heritage included a greenish skin tone, an elongated nose, knobby dermal growths, clawed hands, and limbs that were longer than their non-troll heritage. This last feature was most evident in half-trolls born from unions with some sort of giant, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid.\nAll half-trolls could see in areas of darkness out to , had a good sense of smell, and possessed a greater degree of strength and resilience than their non-troll parentage. However, they were also on average slightly less intelligent than the average individual of their non-troll parentage.\nHalf-trolls did not inherit the notable troll ability to regrow or reattach lost body parts, but their parentage did give them a faster healing factor.\nAs trolls normally bred with their own kind, half-trolls were a rare occurrence. Circumstances that could lead to their conception included a captive troll being forced to breed with other creatures out of a desire by their captor to create powerful minions they could easily control, a troll mating with a polymorphed creature, or from a mateless troll being in heat. When in heat, a mateless troll would wander outside their territories in a blind lust, entering a state where they were willing to attempt mating with whatever creatures they might encounter.\nDue to their troll heritage, half-trolls often had an insatiable craving for raw flesh.\n* Roreldra, a half-elf/half-troll chef and priestess of Loviatar."
