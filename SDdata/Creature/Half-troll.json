        "mainbody": "A '''half-troll''' was a sort of hybrid [[humanoid]], classified as a [[giant]], that was born through the union of a [[troll]] and another unrelated creature.",
        "Description": "Depending on their parentage, the appearance of a half-troll could vary. Typical features reflective of their troll heritage included a greenish skin tone, an elongated nose, knobby dermal growths, clawed hands, and limbs that were longer than their non-troll heritage. This last feature was most evident in half-trolls born from unions with some sort of giant, humanoid, or [[monstrous humanoid]].",
        "Abilities": "All half-trolls could see in areas of [[darkvision|darkness]] out to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, had a good sense of smell, and possessed a greater degree of strength and resilience than their non-troll parentage. However, they were also on average slightly less intelligent than the average individual of their non-troll parentage.\n\nHalf-trolls did not inherit the notable troll ability to regrow or reattach lost body parts, but their parentage did give them a faster healing factor.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Due to their troll heritage, half-trolls often had an insatiable craving for raw flesh."
