        "Description": "A chaos beast had no fixed, original, or true form whatsoever. Instead, it was entirely mutable and always changing, melting, and reshaping itself into new and nightmarish forms. There was no way to predict it and it might try a dozen before adopting one for a time. Some recorded appearances were: [[File:Chaos beast 1.jpg|thumb|right|''A chaos beast could look like this...'']]\n* A towering thing of pulpy flesh and exposed veins, covered in fangs and hooks. It had three legs upon which it walked with unsteady and lurching steps. Its face was fractured, with bent eyes and nose hooked three times. Agonized by this shape, it roared with pain and rage.\n* A filmy mass of rope-like tentacles with vermilion tips that slithered along. It had a bulbous body ringed by gnashing mouths and topped by a viscous sac holding ten bobbing eyes. It had dozens of vestigial wings that flapped too feebly to give it flight. [[File:Chaos beast 2.jpg|thumb|right|''...and then look like this...'']]\n* A powerful and muscular beast, armed with claws and [[crocodile|alligator]] jaws. It charged and attacked furiously.\n* A graceful six-legged creature with delicate arms and shining skin. It had a maned head with three flashing eyes. It walked with a smooth gait and noble bearing.\n* A man-sized creature with stumpy feet it could only shuffle on and hands like crab's claws. Its body was like dough falling from broken bones. Its head was balding and pitted with empty eye sockets. It whimpered pathetically.\n* A slender raptor-like creature with large talons underneath its body and broad wings, all covered with dark fur. It had two hateful coldly gleaming eyes and moved quickly and quietly except to shrill when it attacked. [[File:Chaos beast 3.jpg|thumb|right|''...and then like this.'']]\n* A sac of intestines, warm and wet and steaming and both deaf and blind. To move, it rolled and flopped like limp sausages falling down stairs, becoming looped and draped around all obstacles and lying as a tangled sprawl.\n* A hollowed-out carcass, swelling with gases into a balloon-like husk, bobbing along with the ends of its body trailing about it and tangling others.\n* A plump moth with brilliantly colored wings like the stained glass of temples and compound eyes that sparkled like a myriad of jewels.\n* The person one least suspected.\n\nA chaos beast could be any or all of these, or something else entirely. While its height, length, and breadth might change, a chaos beast generally had a mass of around {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} and a height of between {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} and {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}}. Even then however, they could grow much larger, and more powerful. Though they might have many mouths, they did not say anything.",
        "Behavior": "Changing incessantly, a chaos beast's breeding habits and behaviors seemed pointless to even guess at. Those of Limbo consumed the \"[[chaos-stuff]]\" of that plane, while one was known to consume the bones of its prey. They wandered randomly and did not defend any territory, though they avoided the stabilized, ordered parts of Limbo, tending to be found in the more chaotic parts. Chaos beasts were always encountered alone, mercifully.",
        "Abilities": "Whatever its body part, the touch of a chaos beast against the bare flesh of a living creature inflicted a hideous transformation. Those who could not resist through physical fortitude suffered a corporeal instability, turning their body soft and spongy and gradually losing all sense of form, and melting, flowing, writhing, and bubbling until reduced to an amorphous mass. This was incredibly debilitating: feet and legs became misshapen and weak, slowing their speed; their hands could no longer grip onto things; all worn items became useless and even restrictive as the body bulged, hindering agility. The twisted nerves caused agonizing pain, preventing the victim acting sensibly: unable to recognize allies and enemies, they attacked blindly and clumsily, and they were incapable of using magic. Furthermore, the shock and trauma deteriorated their sanity, increasingly and permanently, until they managed to regain control over their body.\n\nWith effort and confidence, as if their own body was a part of Limbo that they must control, a victim could halt and control the transformation and reassume their original form, and keep trying until they did, but only for a minute. It took constant effort and maintenance to keep their own treacherous body from becoming unstable again; another person could apply the force of will needed to give the victim some time to rest. This corporeal instability was neither a curse nor a disease, but something else, and hence it was difficult to get rid of. Their form could be fixed by ''[[compulsive order]]'', ''[[shapechange]]'', and ''[[stoneskin]]'' spells, with no other effects, but only for their duration. Spells like ''[[heal]]'', ''[[restoration]]'', ''[[greater restoration]]'', ''[[stabilize]]'', or even ''[[limited wish]]'' were needed to lift the instability and restore the body, but not necessarily their sanity.\n\nA victim who could not regain control was left a mindless and bodiless monstrosity, even a shapeless goo. Moreover, it was widely believed that those who did but remained afflicted went on until their madness and body horror became all consuming and they ultimately became chaos beasts themselves. This was, unfortunately, true.\n\nForever changing its form, no [[magic]] made by mortals could trap a chaos beast in a single form or force it into another. A [[polymorph]] spell or even [[flesh to stone|petrification]] effects forced a chaos beast into a new shape, but several seconds later, it could turn back or take another at ease. It was resistant to [[spell]]s in general, and its inconsistent anatomy made it hard to seriously injure.",
