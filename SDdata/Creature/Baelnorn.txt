Baelnorns, sometimes called baelnorn liches, were elves who chose a path of Prime-bound duty beyond death which closely resembled lichdom. They often did so to serve or safeguard their families, communities, or important places,
Most baelnorn were spellcasters, and  maintained their mental and magical abilities in their undead state, with some exceptions.
A baelnorn could be of any non-evil nature, mainly lawful good, retaining whatever alignment it had in life. Compared to other types of liches, baelnorn were far less greedy and power-hungry.
A baelnorn retained all memories, personality traits, and abilities from life, but had a virtual eternity to hone and develop its skills further. Thanks to the near limitless time they could devote to studying magic, baelnorns inevitably became extraordinarily powerful spellcasters.
Baelnorns had the unique power to send a wraith-like projection of themselves out to meet with or converse with others, or to scout an area. These projections could not be dispelled or turned, and could range out to .
While as mighty and terrifying as a lich&mdashsuch that lesser undead and animals would not dare to attack them&mdashbaelnorn lacked a lichs chilling aura of horror that could send weak-willed foes fleeing. Like other powerful forms of undead (such as a vampire or mummy), a baelnorn had unnatural powers owing to its state. For example, it could put mortals in a paralyzed state of hibernation with a touch, making them seem dead to others, and could, through their typically powerful magical spells, summon other lesser undead as well as turn undead. A baelnorn was capable of sustaining tremendous physical damage and was immune to disease, poison, fatigue, and other effects that affected only the living. However, despite all its undead "gifts", a baelnorn considered its greatest resources to be its vast and deep intellect, its supreme mastery of wizardry, and its limitless time to scheme, research, and plan.
It was not possible to turn a baelnorn within the locations where it served or guarded.
A stoic baelnorn.
Baelnorns&mdashwith few exceptions&mdashhad willingly entered into undeath, and although they were considered the elf equivalent of liches, elven society did not perceive them as being as disturbing or unnatural as true liches The choice to become a baelnorn in ancient elvish society was seen as a great sacrifice in which an individual gave up their ability to determine their futures or to pursue social happiness. It was done not only for the sake of ones clan, but for the sake of all elves. Such a request was usually granted only on rare occasions when a clan or settlement had an exceptional need for lorekeepers or guardians. If an elf wished to become a baelnorn, it had to be for their clans benefit, and the Coronal, the High Mages, and the elders of the clan had to agree. As such, these transformations occurred rarely, generally no more than a few times over the millennia and only at the will of the Seldarine.
Baelnorns occasionally received titles based on their occupations
*"Watchnorns" were observers and guardians of public places or family lands, such as Castle Cormanthor)
*"Lorenorns" acted as tutors, librarians, or students of magic or art and
*"Guardnorns" or "Wardnorns" were powerful guardians of crypts and other secret places, or served as the protector of powerful items.
Baelnorn were capable of the same activities as a living elf, although their personal motivations as well as social unease surrounding their public appearances limited them to their dedicated services. Most baelnorn stayed within the crypts, towers, ruins, or other structures which they guarded or worked in, and were rarely seen outside of them. When they did venture out, or when they appeared in public to tutor or protect a family member, they wore hoods to conceal their nature.
The method of becoming a baelnorn was a High Magic or divine ritual The process did not generally require the use or creation of a phylactery, meaning that baelnorns wishing to evade destruction relied on the clone spell. Some less fortunate baelnorns did need to store their souls in a phylactery like a normal lich, in which case they kept it near to the places that they protected or worked.
In ancient elven realms&mdashsuch as Myth Drannor or Sharrven&mdashbaelnorns served as councilors, guardians, and advisors. While many of these stayed out of the public eye, others took active roles in training their families young wizards or protecting travelers. After the citys fall, many remained in the ruins to watch over family vaults or powerful heirlooms. Elminster once consulted with a number of these baelnorns beneath the ruins of Myth Drannor.
The relatively large number of baelnorn in Myth Drannor were credited as being the only reason many elves were able to escape during its fall. Those baelnorn who remained in the ruins were largely involved in protecting the treasures and spellbooks of their clans.
The means for creating a baelnorn were truly ancient, even by elven standards. The secrets were believed to have disappeared after the fall of Myth Drannor as no new baelnorns were known to have been created since then (as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR). However, it was possible that some records may have persisted in Evermeet or Evereska. By this time, few elves considered the decision to become a baelnorn as a worthy one.
As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the church of Kelemvor did not see baelnorn as requiring destruction, and generally preferred to leave them be. However, by the late 15 century DR their stance had hardened, and they called for the eradication of baelnorns as they did all undead even as it brought them into conflict with some elven communities.
Baelnorns continued to stand vigil in the crypts of Myth Drannor after the citys refounding in the late 14 century DR. Some participated in the final battle with the shadovar forces of Thultanthar in the .

Almost all of the green elf Audark clan were wiped out fighting Venominhandar in . After Venoms mate was killed 33 years later, the twelve remaining Audarks, in their grief, appealed to the high mages of Cormanthor to become baelnorns. There was a lively debate among them since no green elf had ever been made into a baelnorn before. Eventually, the mages acceded and transformed all twelve of them.
Their transformation was not typical. Their skin turned into petrified wood, their hair to moss and their eyes to amber. They lost all ability to speak but instead of gaining the arcane powers of a typical baelnorn, they instead became prodigious warriors. As the self-appointed guardians of the Vale of Lost Voices, these new creatures found that they could not leave the Vales boundary, but they could travel instantaneously within it and were telepathically aware of all visitors to their territory. No other green elves subsequently became baelnorns, so it was unknown whether all green elves would undergo a similar transformation or if this was a unique occurrence.
