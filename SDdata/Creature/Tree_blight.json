        "mainbody": "Tree blights were the largest variety of blight.\nTree blights resembled dead trees or treants some  tall. The branches were thorny, the wood unhealthily spongy, and the roots distinctly rubbery. They had blood for sap, and it saturated their bodies thoroughly enough to make them hard to burn.\nTree blights were dim-witted but malevolent plants that delighted in causing carnage.\nTree blights had no real magical abilities beyond their blindsight, the only way they had to sense the world around them. They were recorded as understanding both the Common and Druidic languages, but were not known to speak.\nBy remaining still, a tree blight looked like nothing more than a dead tree. They were large enough to be a significant threat to objects and structures.\nTree blights fought by bludgeoning creatures with their branches or grasping and constricting creatures with their roots. They had mouths, with which they would bite creatures held by their roots.\nTree blights were carnivorous. They were known to fight alongside smaller blights, but each tree blight had an intense hatred of all other tree blights."
