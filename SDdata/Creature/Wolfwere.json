        "mainbody": "wolfwere was an antherion whose natural form was a wolf and could transform into a humanoid or wolf-humanoid hybrid.\nWolfweres were completely different to werewolves, which they were often confused with, as they could both assume lupine, humanoid, and hybrid forms. However, werewolves were lycanthropes, and in some cases, could pass on their condition via an infectious bite. Wolfweres, however, like other antherions, could only pass on their condition genetically.\nThese exceptionally smart creatures were hateful, being the bane of humans and humanoids. They relished brutally slaying them, most often by surprise. Wolfweres could shapechange into very charismatic humanoids (and particularly chose the opposite sex of their victims), so that they could lure others into ambushes. These antherions much preferred their native form, that of a large wolf, which was essentially a dire wolf.\nAs antherions, they hated lycanthropes, as much as lycanthropes hated them.\nMany of these creatures would carry string instruments, such as lutes, often seducing creatures and causing lethargy. Here the wolfweres targets would become slowed and unable to stop the effect.\nWhen wolfweres struck, they reverted to their hybrid forms, in which they could utilize the powers of both humanoids and wolves. In this form, they would attack their prey with both a vicious bite and with weapons. Wolfweres often used axes or swords. If forced to fight in human form, wolfweres might try to escape to shapechange into their hybrid form.\nThese antherions could only be struck by cold iron or magical weapons. They were sickened by belladonna, and chose to avoid it whenever possible.\nWolfweres were almost always lone hunters, and it was very rare to find them in groups of more than three. However, during mating times, multiple wolfweres could attack at once.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, wolfweres could be found in the Domains of Dread.\nDespite not often being found with other wolfweres, they often took the company of evil wolf creatures, such as worgs. The wolfweres would influence these creatures, as well as ordinary wolves, to take an evil path.\nThe werefox goddess Eshebala was known to favor wolfweres because of their hatred of werewolves, though whether or not the wolfweres worshiped her in return was unknown.\n* Harkon Lukas"
