        "mainbody": "A stone defender was a type of clockwork construct developed by gnomish tinkerers to serve as protectors and bodyguards.\nAs its name suggested, the stone defender had massive stone slabs affixed to its form to serve as shields. Beyond defense, these slabs aided to a form of camouflage. When the defender stood against a stone or rocky surface, it became imperceptible from its surroundings.\nOnly magical weapons or those forged from adamantine could damage a stone defender. Similarly, magical spells were often less effective when cast against the clockwork construct.\nLike other constructs, a stone defender did not have to breathe air, eat food, or sleep for rest.\nThe stone defenders large stone shields were useful both offensively and defensively in combat. It could slam them into foes, or use them to protect nearby allies from attacks.\nThe high priests of the Tenebrous Creed deployed at a pair of stone defenders to watch over their operations in the Thunder Peaks in the late 15 century DR. Their defenders had shields constructed from a green, glass-like stone."
