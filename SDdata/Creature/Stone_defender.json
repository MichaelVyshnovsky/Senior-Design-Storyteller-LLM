        "mainbody": "A '''stone defender''' was a type of [[clockwork]] [[construct]] developed by [[gnomish]] tinkerers to serve as protectors and bodyguards.",
        "Description": "As its name suggested, the stone defender had massive stone slabs affixed to its form to serve as shields. Beyond defense, these slabs aided to a form of camouflage. When the defender stood against a stone or rocky surface, it became imperceptible from its surroundings.",
        "Abilities": "Only [[item enchantment|magical weapons]] or those forged from [[adamantine]] could damage a stone defender. Similarly, [[magic]]al spells were often less effective when cast against the clockwork construct.\n\nLike other constructs, a stone defender did not have to breathe air, eat food, or sleep for rest.",
        "Combat": "The stone defender's large stone shields were useful both offensively and defensively in combat. It could slam them into foes, or use them to protect nearby allies from attacks.",
        "History": "The high priests of the [[Tenebrous Creed]] deployed at a pair of stone defenders to watch over their operations in the [[Thunder Peaks]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their defenders had shields constructed from a green, glass-like stone.{{Cite adventurers league/To Walk the Cold Dark|11}}"
