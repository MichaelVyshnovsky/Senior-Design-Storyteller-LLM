'''Muskrats''' were a small species of rodent.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
In [[northwest Faerûn]], muskrats could be found in the wilderness of [[Icewind Dale]].

Beyond [[Faerûn]], muskrats could be found in the arctic plains of the [[Endless Wastes]] and on the [[Malatran Plateau]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Masks of the Dohi-ri|4}}
===Relationships===
Muskrats were known to act as [[favored animal|servants]] of the [[deity]] [[Thoth]].

[[Ranger]]s that were specialized in traversing swamps sometimes had muskrats as [[animal companion]]s.

===Usages===
Some creatures were known to kill muskrats for their pelts. These generally sold for around five [[silver piece]]s.

In [[Mirabar]], the [[Sign of the Forgehammer]] inn sometimes served its patrons muskrat meat as a side.

==Notable Muskrats==
* [[Muskie]], a muskrat in Icewind Dale who in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] was ''[[awaken]]ed'' by a [[goliath]] [[druid]].{{Cite adventurers league/Ice Road Trackers|2-3}}
