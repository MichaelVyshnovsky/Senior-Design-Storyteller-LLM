Muskrats were a small species of rodent.
In northwest Faerûn, muskrats could be found in the wilderness of Icewind Dale.
Beyond Faerûn, muskrats could be found in the arctic plains of the Endless Wastes and on the Malatran Plateau.
Muskrats were known to act as servants of the deity Thoth.
Rangers that were specialized in traversing swamps sometimes had muskrats as animal companions.
Some creatures were known to kill muskrats for their pelts. These generally sold for around five silver pieces.
In Mirabar, the Sign of the Forgehammer inn sometimes served its patrons muskrat meat as a side.
