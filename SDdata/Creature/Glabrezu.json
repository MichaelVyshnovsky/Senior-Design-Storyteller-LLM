        "Abilities": "Glabrezu had access to a wide variety of [[spell]]s, including the power to spontaneously generate ''[[darkness]]'' and ''[[dispel magic]]''. They had [[truesight]] that extended as far as their telepathic communication that they could use in concert during their dealings so as to avoid being seen and to prevent acts of deception. Both their arms were fully functional, but they made more use of their claws in combat in order to grapple their enemies. Although they could travel between the planes freely, they usually only came to the mortal plane when summoned.\n\nGlabrezu could cast ''[[wish]]'' for a mortal once per month.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Glabrezu and Drizzt.jpg|thumb|left|''A glabrezu in combat with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].'']]\nGlabrezu preferred deception to combat, particularly if it served no actual purpose. They would rather have their minions do the work if they did not need to do it themselves, and through their corrupting ways could turn allies into enemies and brainwash companions into fighting one another. However, they had no qualms about direct confrontation and did not hesitate to wade into battle, in fact embracing any chance to burst into violence.{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Codex I, Part 2: The Lost Annals/Additional Layers}}\n\nUnlike normal magic users, glabrezu did not stand behind their minions casting spells, but ran straight into combat using chaos-inducing powers to send the battlefield into disarray. A glabrezu's normal strategy in combat was to use their ''[[confusion]]'' spell-like ability before using ''[[chaos hammer]]'' or ''[[unholy blight]]'' to finish off wounded foes. They might also use ''[[reverse gravity]]'' to launch enemies into the air before letting them drop back down, or combine it with ''[[Power word, stun|power word stun]]'' (which was usually saved for the strongest opponent) to send them careening helplessly into the air.<ref name= \"WTAG\" /> They casually used ''[[dispel magic]]'' while dealing with other problems using their various physical and magical abilities.\n\nThroughout a fight, a glabrezu might summon demons great in size or number. They were powerful enough to have little compunction about doing this if the battle was difficult, as unlike lesser demons they were not concerned with needing to compensate the help for their services.<ref name= \"WTAG\" /> Little prevented them from [[teleport at will|teleporting at will]] across the battlefield, and they were willing to simply leave the fight to harass their foes another day.",

            "Mortals": "[[File:Glabrezu drow.png|thumb|right|400px|''A glabrezu being summoned by a [[drow]] [[priestess]].'']]\nGlabrezu were most commonly summoned directly by a mortal, such as ambitious [[human]] [[wizard]]s or [[drow]] [[priest]]esses who hoped to make a bargain. They hated it when they were forced to follow the orders of mortals, and avenged themselves by crushing the spirits of those around them once back in the Abyss.\n\nSometimes glabrezu found potential victims on their own, presenting their \"gift\" whether or not the recipient wanted it. If their victims refused their offers, glabrezu thought nothing of slaughtering them instead, as being willing to summon a demon was likely indicative of their fate regardless.<ref name= \"WTAG\" />\n\nGlabrezu promised much to mortals, but their capacity to grant wish spells to their \"clients\" was one of their most dangerous offers. Glabrezu required the wish being granted to be for an evil cause that would cause incalculable devastation or suffering. Failing this, they demanded an act of great wickedness be committed as payment, or for the one petitioning them to make an incredible sacrifice. Even worse than asking a glabrezu to grant one's wish was accepting an offer made by the demon itself.<ref name= \"WTAG\" />"
        },
        "Ecology": "Among the most fearsome aspects of the glabrezu was their mere presence on the [[Material plane]], as lingering too long caused their corruption to spread. Arrogant mortal summoners often believed they could control glabrezu with ease but the very act of their summoning planted seeds of evil. Their corruption sickened people, animals, and plants alike, even causing the sky itself to grow darker as they leeched off the power of the plane.\n\nIn an unholy, rarely successful ritual, a half-drow, half-glabrezu monstrosity known as a [[draegloth]] could be born from a drow priestess. Unlike glabrezu, they were impatient and destructive, only improving their magic that could be used for destructive purposes. They served drow houses as opposed to the masters of the Abyss, but were believed to be a sign of support from [[Lolth]].",
        "History": {
            "Recent Events": "Around [[1385 DR]], [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] was killed (for the second time) by magical backlash from a glabrezu.\n\nIn [[1485 DR|1485]]–[[1486 DR]], glabrezu were among the demons that wandered the streets of [[Menzoberranzan]] and participated in the failed defense of [[Q'Xorlarrin]] against the [[dwarves]]. In that conflict, a glabrezu slew former king [[Connerad Brawnanvil]].\n\nThe demon [[Marilith (individual)|Marilith]] often traveled with two glabrezu guards.\n\nSome glabrezu traveled to the [[Endless Labyrinth]], the 600{{th}} layer, in order to capture [[goristro]]s for use by other demon lords, raids that [[Baphomet]] begrudgingly tolerated as a method of raising his own legendary status."
