'''Opossums''', also known as '''possums''', were small [[marsupial]]s that lived in forests.

==Description==
The fur of an opossum was coarse and oily.

==Abilities==
Opossums had keen senses of smell and hearing.

==History==
In the ancient [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Eileanar]], magically altered opossums known as [[sniffer]]s acted as the noses of [[spider golem]]s.

==Ecology==
Opossums were arboreal creatures. They hunted poisonous [[snakes]].

===Habitats===
Opossums could be found in [[Cormanthor]], [[Thar]], the [[Tannath Gap]], [[Semberholme]], and the [[Mere of Dead Men]].{{Cite dungeon/71/Dreadful Vestiges|49}} Intelligent opossums capable of speech were found on the [[Steaming Isles]], where they acted as chamberlains and household servants to the animal [[pasha]]s. Due to the influence of [[Citadel Umbra]], opossums of the [[Winterglen]] operated as spies for [[Unseelie Court|Unseelie]] creatures in the forest.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|7}}
===Relationships===
Opossums were sometimes taken as [[familiar]]s by [[wizard]]s,{{Cite dragon/84/A cast of strange familiars|16}} and [[rangers]] that dwelt in urban environments took them as [[animal companion]]s.

Some were known to act as [[favored animal|servants]] of the [[deity]] [[Thoth]].

===Subspecies===
====Copper Opossum====
The copper opossum was a native to [[Cormyr]], living on its hills. Its diet mainly consisted of weeds and sprouts. The shy creature rolled itself into a ball at the least provocation; if attacked past that point, it could lash with the venomous spikes just above its feet.

Though some long-lived locals related it causing paralysis, the poison was known to actually induce an effect all but indistinguishable from ''[[temporal stasis]]'', except that ''[[neutralize poison]]'' could break it as well. A competent metalworker could also extract up to five pounds of metal from the pelt of a copper opossum, which incidentally, contained actual [[copper]].

====Giant Opossum====
Giant opossums were known to live west of [[Urmlaspyr]], where the largest game reserve for the species in [[Toril]] was.

==Notable Opossums==
* [[Pocket]], the pet of the young mage's apprentice [[Sil]].

==Trivia==
* In the [[church of Baervan Wildwanderer|church of]] [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], "Opossum" was one of the titles for confirmed [[priest]]s, ranking directly above "[[Squirrel]]" and below "[[Hedgehog]]".
