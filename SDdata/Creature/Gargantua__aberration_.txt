A '''gargantua''' was an [[aberration]] born from [[giant]]s that grew to greater than normal size.

==Description==
Gargantuas had a large and muscular body, hairless purplish skin, horns, and bony protrusions around their body. They were much taller than even other giants, reaching heights of at least {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}.

==Biology==
A gargantua was born as a normal child of giant parents, looking like its corresponding type of giant, but once it reached adulthood it mutated. It gained a purplish complexion, grew horns and bony protrusions around its body, and quickly grew significantly bigger.

==Personality==
The majority of gargantuas did not feel at home in giant communities and started looking for homes that were large enough to fit their extremely large frames. Some of them only wanted peace and solitude, but others turned aggressive against those they thought feared them.

==Abilities==
Gargantuas had an aura that could cause others within 30 feet (9 meters) of them to see the gargantua as a manifestation of their greatest fears, inflicting psychic damage and frightening them. They could also incapacitate creatures they could see within {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} of them with a curse. Furthermore, they could teleport and mimic spells just by observation.

Their bodies were resistant to force and psychic damage and they had superb senses, being able to see in the dark and having great perception in general.

They could not be frightened.

==Combat==
Gargantuas usually fought off attackers by throwing rocks or crushing them with their body. But they also utilized their various strange abilities, like their aura, curse, or spell mimicry.

==History==
It was not known for certain what caused normal giants to mutate into gargantuas; rather, there were only stories. Some said that their origin was linked to a pact between an ancient enclave and an entity of the [[Far Realm]]. Others claimed that the giant god [[Karontor]], a banished son of [[Annam]], created gargantuas as revenge for his imprisonment. Still other stories laid the blame for gargantuas with Annam and claimed that he was disgusted by his descendants and wanted to destroy them somehow.
