'''Kaortic hulks''' were a mutated species of warped beasts from the [[Far Realm]] that served the [[kaorti]], albeit reluctantly.

==Description==
Kaortic hulks barely resembled the terrestrial beasts they were assumed to have mutated from, possessing bronze resinous armor, sharp claws, and no eyes or ears. Nonetheless, they had a keen sense for their prey, and their sightless nature did not deter them from hunting ruthlessly.

==Personality==
Kaortic hulks were little more than cunning hunters, but their hunger was truly insatiable. A single kaortic hulk was said to be able to decimate entire populations by itself.

==Abilities==
Kaortic hulks innately possessed a few magical abilities: twice each day, they could replicate the [[spell]]s ''[[silence]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[gaseous form]]'', and ''[[spider climb]]''. However, their innate spellcasting was instinctual rather than based on their intellect.

==Combat==
The kaortic hulk was a bruiser first and foremost, but their large size did not preclude them from being stealthy. Kaortic hulks were known to stalk their prey by utilizing the ''silence'' and ''invisibility'' spells to deadly effect, then lash out with their claws. Additionally, they could cast ''gaseous form'' to enter spaces that their bodies normally could not fit through and ''spider climb'' to crawl above their victims and ambush them.

===Relationships===
Kaortic hulks were conscripted, alongside [[rukanyr]]s and [[skybleeder]]s, to be the ground troops of the kaorti's armies, but they had a temperamental relationship to their so-called masters. If summoned or enthralled by a spell or effect, they had a small, but ever-present, chance to turn on their summoner or master.

==History==
Occasionally, beasts from the [[Prime Material plane|Material Plane]] would traverse into the Far Realm, but they would not remain in their current form for long. Instead, they were swallowed by the Amoebic Sea, stretched by some [[Elder evil|eldritch entity]], and twisted into a horrifying mockery of their former shape. Some legends stated that the first kaortic hulk was a prominent mage's [[familiar]], lost to the Far Realm during an attempt to study its properties.
