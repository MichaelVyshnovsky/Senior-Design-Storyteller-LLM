        "Description": "Gens D'Or were creatures of magnificence, often coated in polished shining armor, giants among other horses. They had hard and deadly metallic hooves and hides of [[silver]], gold or [[bronze]]. Each metallic hair on the Gens D'Or's hide majestically glistened in the sun with the creatures' every move. When adorned in full armor, they resembled giant animated statues.\n\nGens D'Or's beauty was matched by their riders, the [[Blade Captain]]s of the Blade Kingdoms, who were adorned in the similarly magnificent glistening and intimately decorated armor and [[ostrich]]-plumed helmets.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, Gens D'Or were used in annual bloodless \"white wars\" between the region's six city-states, as well as the short but bloody [[Blade Wars]] that started in the fall of 1217 DR, blossomed during the [[11-Day Civil War]], and lasted until the spring {{YearlinkName|1218}}. Some of the Gens D'Or during that time included Prince-Elect of [[Sumbria]] – [[Cappa Mannicci]]'s majestic burnt bronze steed, and silver Gens D'Or ridden by Blade Captains of [[Ugo Svarézi]] of [[Colletro]]."
