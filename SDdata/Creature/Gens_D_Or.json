They had hard and deadly metallic hooves and hides of silver, gold or bronze. Each metallic hair on the Gens DOrs hide majestically glistened in the sun with the creatures every move. When adorned in full armor, they resembled giant animated statues.\nGens DOrs beauty was matched by their riders, the Blade Captains of the Blade Kingdoms, who were adorned in the similarly magnificent glistening and intimately decorated armor and ostrich-plumed helmets.\nAs of the , Gens DOr were used in annual bloodless \"white wars\" between the regions six city-states, as well as the short but bloody Blade Wars that started in the fall of 1217 DR, blossomed during the 11-Day Civil War, and lasted until the spring . Some of the Gens DOr during that time included Prince-Elect of Sumbria – Cappa Manniccis majestic burnt bronze steed, and silver Gens DOr ridden by Blade Captains of Ugo Svarézi of Colletro."
