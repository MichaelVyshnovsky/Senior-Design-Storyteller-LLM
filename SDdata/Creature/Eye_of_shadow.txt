'''Eyes of shadow''' were [[beholder]]s that had been warped by too much time spent in areas connected to the [[Shadowfell]].

==Personality==
These creatures delighted in arousing fear in their victims.

==Abilities==
An eye of shadow possessed four different eye-beam abilities. Their central eye could induce fear in their enemies. The abilities of their other eye beams included a ray of radiant energy that temporarily blinded their foes, a deafening ray of thunderous sound, and a ray of necrotic energy that temporarily immobilized those hit by it. In addition, those hit by this shadowbond ray were unable to see an eye of shadow or other [[shadow creature]]s that were close by.

Due to being tainted by the Shadowfell, these creatures were also very stealthy and could make themselves appear invisible in areas of darkness.

==Combat==
Like all beholders, these creatures fought by means of their eyebeams and toothy maws.

==Trivia==
Whenever the ''[[Dreamheart]]'' opened its eye, an eye of shadow was one of the creatures that would potentially be summoned by it.{{Cite dungeon/182/The Dreamheart|30}}
