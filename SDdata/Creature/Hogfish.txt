'''Hogfish''' was a species of [[fish]] found in [[Akanamere]] of the [[Akanal]].

==Ecology==
===Usages===
Hogfish was a pantry staple in the city of [[Sumbria]] of the [[Blade Kingdoms]] perched on the shores of Akanamere. However hogfish was not often consumed in other city-states of the Kingdoms, such as [[Lomatra]]. Dried hogfish could be found in the kitchen pantries of the [[Palace of Manniccis]] in Sumbria.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, willful Princess of Sumbria, [[Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria]] accidentally summoned a wild shaggy green-furred creature while learning [[the Art]] from ''[[Lady Faveretti's Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners)]]''. The strange magical vermin became a bane on the palace's employees and the Lady of the house, [[Ulia Mannicci]]. The green menace fancied dried hogfish and regularly stole the palace's kitten supplies, sending servants on endless quest of searching the wainscoting for the creature.
