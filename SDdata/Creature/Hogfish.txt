Hogfish was a species of fish found in Akanamere of the Akanal.
Hogfish was a pantry staple in the city of Sumbria of the Blade Kingdoms perched on the shores of Akanamere. However hogfish was not often consumed in other city-states of the Kingdoms, such as Lomatra. Dried hogfish could be found in the kitchen pantries of the Palace of Manniccis in Sumbria.
In the , willful Princess of Sumbria, Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria accidentally summoned a wild shaggy green-furred creature while learning the Art from Lady Faverettis Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners). The strange magical vermin became a bane on the palaces employees and the Lady of the house, Ulia Mannicci. The green menace fancied dried hogfish and regularly stole the palaces kitten supplies, sending servants on endless quest of searching the wainscoting for the creature.
