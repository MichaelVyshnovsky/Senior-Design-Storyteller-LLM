        "mainbody": "'''Axe beaks''' were tall and aggressive flightless birds.",
        "Description": "Axe beaks got their name from their sharp wedge-shaped beaks. They had strong necks and powerful legs, which they used to sprint at high speeds.",
        "Abilities": "Axebeaks were faster runners than most [[horse]]s.In v.3.5 rules, both axebeaks and [[horse]]s have the Run feat, which allows them to move five times their normal movement speed over flat, even terrain, but axebeaks have a speed 5 higher than that of a light horse. This calculates to {{SIspeed|34|mph|k|h}} for the horse and {{SIspeed|37|mph|k|h}} for the axebeak. At least five [[Faerûn]]ian breeds—the [[Calimite]], [[Chionthar (horse)|Chionthar]], [[Dambraii]], [[Lhesperan]], and [[Raurin (horse)|Raurin]]—could run faster than the axebeak, attaining maximum speeds of {{SIspeed|40|mph|k|h}}. <br />For comparison, in the real world, some horses can reach speeds of over {{SIspeed|50|mph|k|h}}, but v.3.5 consistently gives lower maximum speeds for animals, likely because the ''Monster Manuals'' include representatives of average specimens.",
        "Behavior": "Axe beaks were aggressive hunters and usually hunted during daytime. They were always prone to attack any unfamiliar creatures that approached them.",
        "Combat": "The main natural weapon an axe beak used in combat was its heavy and sharp beak.",
        "Ecology": "Axe beaks were most commonly found in hills and grasslands, but they were also common to the jungles of [[Chult]] and the [[Snout of Omgar]].<ref name= TTP5e-p5\">\n\nFlocks of axe beaks were also believed to be protective of their young, rushing to its aid in case of danger.\n\nThe [[tortle]]s of [[Ahoyhoy]] sometimes captured wild axe beaks to sell them to visitors.<ref name= TTP5e-p10\">"
