Their wings were made from a strong, rubber-like substance.\nBecause of the demonic energy infusing it, a chardalyn dragon was a malevolent creature who relished in the suffering of others.\nChardalyn dragons were powerful constructs. These constructs were immune to damage from the cold and poisoning. They had significant natural magical resistance and were immune to fear and to paralyzing and petrifying effects and spells. Any spell that attempted to change a chardalyn dragons form or structure failed. Chardalyn dragons emitted a powerful charm-like aura. Any sentient creature within  of the construct was vulnerable to this charm-like effect.\nthumb|right|300px|Adventurers squaring off against a chardalyn dragon\nIn combat, a chardalyn dragon attacked its target with its sharp claws and teeth.
