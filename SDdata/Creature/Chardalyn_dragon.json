        "Abilities": "Chardalyn dragons were powerful constructs. These constructs were immune to damage from the cold and poisoning. They had significant natural [[Magic resistance|magical resistance]] and were immune to fear and to paralyzing and petrifying effects and spells. Any spell that attempted to change a chardalyn dragon's form or structure failed. Chardalyn dragons emitted a powerful charm-like aura. Any sentient creature within {{SI|30|ft}} of the construct was vulnerable to this charm-like effect.",

It used its powerful tail to smash an opponent, and its wings were strong enough to bludgeon a target.",
        "Ecology": "As constructs, chardalyn dragons did not require drink or food, nor did they require rest or sleep.",
        "History": "Circa the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the [[duergar]] [[Xardorok Sunblight]] finished construction of a chardalyn dragon within his mountainside fortress of [[Sunblight]]. It was let loose from the [[duergar]] fortress to decimate the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], flying first to the small village of [[Dougan's Hole]]."
