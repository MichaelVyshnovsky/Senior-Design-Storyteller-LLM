        "Description": "Aurumachs were tall, beautiful, and strong [[humanoids]] with golden skin. Their eyes glowed so brightly, it was difficult for most creatures to make eye contact.",
        "Abilities": "Aurumachs were extremely powerful, gifted with many innate magical abilities. They were the equals of the most powerful [[aasimar]] and [[fiend]]s.",
        "Personality": "Aurumachs were avaricious, distant, and economical.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Rilmani3e.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''An aurumach (left) and a [[cuprilach]] (right).'']]\nAurumachs avoided direct combat if they could, although they did not hesitate to unleash violence immediately if such an action was required to restore balance. Their armor and weapons were created&mdash;and summoned&mdash;by sheer will. Because of this, an aurumach could not be disarmed or tricked into dropping its weapon. Aurumachs usually wielded powerful [[halberd]]s or [[vorpal]] swords. Their armor was similar to [[field plate]].\n\nAurumachs were capable of attacking a target with a brilliant ray of energy. This ray of energy automatically transformed into a form that exploited the target's natural vulnerabilities. As an a example, if a target was vulnerable to cold or ice, this ray of energy transformed into a chilling cold energy.",
        "Society": "Despite rilmani lacking a system of government, aurumachs were considered the unofficial leaders and organizers of the rilmani. They were the diplomats and primary strategists of rilmani society. There was only about one hundred aurumachs total.",
        "History": "As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a single aurumach and several [[ferrumach|ferrumach rilmani]] composed one of the three groups connected to the final seal in the fifth level of [[Watcher's Keep]]. Unlike other instances, these rilmani could be summoned to [[Toril]] when the ''spirit key'' was used to unlock one third of the keep's seal."
