        "Description": "For the specific case of [[Iliph Thraun]], the lich lord resembled a hovering skull with white pinpoints of light in its eye sockets.",
        "Abilities": "Iliph Thraun was unique in its need for specially modified spells to sustain itself, and its ability to wield ''[[spellfire]]''.",
        "History": "One particular lich lord, Iliph Thraun, had risen ca. [[350 DR]], a thousand years prior to {{yearlink|1357}}. The lich achieved its lichdom through a flawed process, and thus required spells to survive. It joined the search for [[Shandril Shessair]] in that year, after being brought before [[Manshoon]] by [[Zulthondre]], who recommended the lich lord and furnished the means of controlling it. The beholder [[Xarlraun]] also had a bauble to control the lich lord.",
