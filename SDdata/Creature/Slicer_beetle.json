        "mainbody": "Slicer beetles were a rare species of giant beetle, distantly related to death watch beetles.\nOn average a slicer beetle grew to be  in length. They bore a great resemblance to giant stag beetles, though lacked their distinctive horn protrusions. Others described them as looking like a six-legged centipede. They had hardened exo-skeletons that were either black or dark gray in color. Their most notable feature was their razor-sharp mandibles.\nLike many species of beetle, slicers possessed very poor eyesight and sense of hearing. They often liked to horde sliceable items in their lairs, such as gauntlets and boots.\nThese creatures fought primarily with their mandibles. If combat ever seemed to be going against their favor, a slicer beetle would grab whatever limbs it had managed to sever and flee.\nIn 1357 DR, slicer beetles could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep.\nSlicer beetles were largely solitary creatures.\nLike almost any species of beetle, these creatures were carnivorous. Much like the giant stag beetle, slicers would often raid cultivated lands for food, feding upon peasants, livestock, and whatever other creature they came across.\nSlicer beetles were typically found within forests of regions with a temperate climate.\nBeyond Toril, these beetles could be found on the planet of Oerth."
