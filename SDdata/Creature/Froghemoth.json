        "mainbody": "'''Froghemoths''' were massive amphibious predators with four tentacles and three eyes. They were revered by [[bullywug]]s, who treated them as gods.",
        "Description": "Froghemoths were some {{SI|18|ft}} long (or tall, when standing) and {{SI|10|ft}} wide, yellow on the belly and yellowish-green on the undersides of the legs, shading to light green on the sides, and then to mottled green on the {{SIAdj|15|ft|adj=long}} tentacles and back. The nostrils were on short stalks, and the three eyes, which were greenish-tinged amber with vertical, bright green edged with orange pupils, were similarly located on retractable appendage. Fully grown froghemoths weighed {{SI|5|ton|k}}.\n\nImmature froghemoths, called '''tadhemoths''', looked fish-like, with four pectoral fins and two tails (which became tentacles and legs respectively) hatched from eggs about {{SI|1|ft}} in diameter, and grew a foot each month for six months, and then a foot every two months until they reached full size. The tentacles started developing at the six-month mark, and the legs started developing by the tenth month. After twelve months, the creature was fully mature. Tadhemoths were fully aquatic and relied on gills to breathe.",
        "Relations": "If a bullywug tribe came across a froghemoth, they would attempt to lure it to their den, paying tribute in the form of food and protection. They could communicate only at a basic level, so the froghemoth usually killed and ate a number of bullywugs before they could successfully communicate their intentions.",
        "History": "According to [[Omu]]an legends, the froghemoths were a creation of the [[primordial]] [[Ubtao]]. When [[Papazotl]] the [[eblis]] discovered Ubtao had forsaken the Omuans, he sent [[Kubazan]] the [[toad]] to parlay with Ubtao on behalf of the [[human]]s. But this enraged Kubazan, and he decided to wrest with Ubtao instead. Amused, the primordial gave Kubazan tentacles to make it stronger, creating the first froghemoth.",
        "Notable froghemoths": "[[File:Froghemoth - comic.jpg|thumb|right|''A froghemoth swallowing Salabak.'']]\nFroghemoths dwelt in a swamp outside [[Manshaka]] in [[Calimshan]]. In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], lured by the fighting between [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] and [[Salabak]], it burst out of the water and caught Salabak with its long tongue, devouring him before retreating underwater.{{Cite comic/The Last Betrayal|19-21}}\n\nKubazan, one of the [[Primal_spirit#The_Nine_Trickster_Gods_of_Chult|Nine Trickster Gods]] of [[Chult]], was a froghemoth."
