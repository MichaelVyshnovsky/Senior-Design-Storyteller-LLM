        "mainbody": "hamster was a mostly harmless creature that came in several varieties.\nthumb|273px|There were several offshoots of hamsters.\nHamsters were small, that proved no threat to humanoids.\nThough some hamsters were ordinary rodents, there were several different offshoots, most notably giant space hamsters.\nTinker gnomes from wildspace were responsible for bringing giant space hamsters to an unrevealed place in the Realms, and called themselves \"hamster masters\". Hamsters were sometimes kept by adventurers around the multiverse, such as thieves, and demihumans, particularly dwarves and gnomes.\nthumb|Some call them pets, others – a filling grilled dish.\nHamsters were a delicacy served during royal balls and events in Sumbria of the Blade Kingdoms. The creatures were stuffed, sauced, and served by a platter-full.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, the deep levels of Undermountain contained polymorph traps. Such traps were able to capture a single being and transform them into a hamster.\nthumb|273px|right|Minscs hamster companion, Boo.\n* Boo, a hamster whose addled owner, Minsc, believed him to be a miniature giant space hamster.\n* Spanky, Jan Jansens hamster that he apparently had as a child."
