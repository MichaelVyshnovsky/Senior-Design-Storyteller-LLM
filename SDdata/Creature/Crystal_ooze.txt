Crystal oozes were an offshoot species of gray ooze that had adapted to living in water.
These cousins to the gray oozes were very hard to spot when in water. Their translucent bodies were as clear as glass, but sometimes featured swirls of white.
Despite being used to existing in water, crystal oozes were capable of surviving outside it for many hours, where they could hunt for prey.
As with gray oozes, they reproduced by budding (crystal) pods, which took up to ten days to hatch into newly formed gray oozes. If food was scarce, the oozes ate their offspring, but otherwise did not, and might live alongside them.
These oozes had a variety of immunities. Such as being impervious to harm by acid, fire, heat, or cold. Only magical and electrical energy seemed to harm the beings, except for raw damage from metal weapons.
Unlike other oozes, they were proficient at swimming and wading through liquids. These rare oozes had animal-level intelligence.
Crystal oozes were generally more difficult to fight than other oozes. Although they could not corrode metal, they directly poisoned cloth, flesh, and wood. They struck out at their opponents, much like snakes, and then tried to submerge or smother their foes. If the oozes directly touched any part of a typical living being, the being would find itself paralyzed and quickly consumed.
These oozes scavenged almost anything for food, but never anything made of metal.
Due to their eating habits, the lairs of of crystal oozes could contain metal weapons and pieces of armor.
In order to better themselves, crystal oozes usually inhabited dark, murky pools of water instead of clear water.
Many were known to dwell in various places throughout Undermountain. In the Hordelands, they could occasionally be found in the lakes, rivers, and swamps of the Ama Basin during the summer season.
