        "mainbody": "'''Asrai''', also referred to as '''water sprites''' in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and '''Sjöra''' on [[Ysgard]],",
        "Description": "Arai appeared as delicate, humanoid-shaped faeries that stood around {{SIrange|1|4.5|in|c|long=yes}} tall. They had with long golden hair that was constantly growing, often reaching down to their buttocks or calves. Asrai rarely ever wore clothing, preferring instead to use their hair to cover their modesty. Their hair was sort of a living extension of them, twisting and flexing in unconscious reaction to their feelings.",
        "Personality": "Asrai were highly intelligent creatures,",
        "Abilities": "Asrai had only a single magical ability of note: when a group of them swam in a weaving, darting water dance, they created the effects of ''[[hypnotic pattern]]''. Notably, [[charm]]ed [[fish]] would refuse to attack asrai.\n\nTheir bodies had a severe sensitivity to true [[sunlight]], to the point that exposure could kill them. However, artificial sunlight like that of the [[spell]] ''[[sunray]]'' had no effect on them. Some types of deep-dwelling asrai, primarily those that inhabited the [[River Oceanus]], additionally could not survive in air for any length of time and would die if captured.",
        "Combat": "These faeries never attacked out of malice or vengeance, but only to defend themselves. They carried no weapons and instead used their magic and their teeth if needed. Though the asrai that inhabited [[Arborea]] were known to wield small bows made of springy [[willow]] and braided water, with [[arrow]]s smeared in fish guts that could potentially give those hit by them a [[disease]].",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "The asrai were a vegetarian species. They fed on algae and water plants such as [[kelp]], as well as food thrown on the surface of the water (for this behavior, they were sometimes mistaken for minnows). They did not, however, ever eat meat; nor did other animals of the waters prey upon them.",
            "Homelands": "Asrai made their homes deep beneath lakes, rivers, and seas. They were strictly nocturnal, coming up to feed only at night. They could be found in both fresh and salt water bodies, though typically lived in bodies of freshwater and would feel sluggish for a few days following a transition from one type of water to another. In bodies of freshwater they laired in shadowy places such as caves, logs, or under banks.\n\nOn the [[Outer Planes]] asrai could be found in bodies of water in the Beastlands, Ysgard, and Arborea. Those in Arborea acted as protectors of its many warriors. The largest school of them in the Outer Planes could be found in the River Oceanus, though they rarely surfaced, except on nights when the algae bloomed.\n\nAsrai also had loose ties to the [[Seelie Court (divine realm)|Seelie Court]], though rarely showed themselves there.",
            "Languages": "In addition to speaking their own languages, asrai spoke the languages of [[balaena]], [[fish]], [[Merfolk language|mermaids]], [[Nixie language|nixies]], [[Sirine language|sirines]], [[Triton language|tritons]], and [[sea elvish]]. The asrai that inhabited Arborea additionally knew languages of various nature spirits, such as [[dryad]]s and [[oread]]s.",
            "Relationships": "They were known to keep company with [[nymph]]s, [[sirine]]s, [[selkie]]s, and various aquatic animals. They were often welcomed by these creatures and [[sea elves]] within the Seelie Court. The asrai that inhabited Arborea often coordinated with the plane's nature spirits to carry out punishments on anyone that infringed Arborean waters. And the asrai of the River Oceanus sometimes acted as companions, guides, or translators for the balaena.\n\nBecause of their ''hypnotic pattern'' ability's tendency to make sailors fall into water, [[shark]]s, [[giant pike]]s, and various predatory species of [[fish]] sometimes followed asrai schools in hopes of preying upon such unlucky sailors. Though the fish rarely had any bond of friendship with the asrai themselves.\n\nSome [[evil]] fisherfolk were known to set out bait for asrai and capture them inside of [[amphora]] enspelled with ''[[darkness]]'' for the purpose of selling to creatures of the [[Lower Planes]] that considered them to be delicacies, such as the [[hydroloth]]s, [[marraenoloth]]s, and [[slaadi]]. A captured asrai usually sold for around 200 to 300 [[gold piece]]s.\n\nAsrai were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of [[Deep Sashelas]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], and [[Hanali Celanil]].<ref>"
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to ancient legends the asrai once served as guides across all of the River Oceanus, but had long since abandoned their duty. There also existed rumors of asrai possibly inhabiting the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], the aqueducts and [[sewer]]s of [[Sigil]], and even the [[Prime Material plane]]. However, due to their elusiveness these rumors were unconfirmed.\n\nOther rumors spoke of there being an asrai queen in the Seelie Court, hidden within either a bottomless well or a spring of pure, everflowing water."
