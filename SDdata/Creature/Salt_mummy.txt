'''Salt mummies''' were a form of [[undead]] that arose from the bodies of those that died carrying a great sin, the horror of which gradually created a linkage to the [[Negative Energy plane]], and were buried too close to veins of salt.

==Description==
Salt mummies were [[humanoid]] figures, typically {{SI|6|ft}} tall and weighing around {{SI|180|lbs.|k}}. Their bodies were so minerally encrusted and dried out from the [[salt]] they were buried near that it was impossible to determine what race they were in life.

==Abilities==
Salt mummies were supernaturally arid. They uniquely possessed the ability to evaporate moisture from anything they touched, even plants and [[water elemental]]s.

All forms of water harmed salt mummies as though they were [[holy water]].

==Ecology==
Salt mummies were typically found either solitarily, in pairs, or in clusters of five to nine individuals.
===Habitats===
Salt mummies were known to haunt some of the larger salt caverns beneath [[Faer√ªn]]. Most notably they could be found in the [[Buried Realms]] near the ruins of [[Tethyamar]], beneath the [[Raurin desert]], and the [[Darklands]]. In particular, the area of the Darklands near the [[Troglodyte Warrens]] of [[Traaskl Thorog]], beneath [[Chessenta]].
