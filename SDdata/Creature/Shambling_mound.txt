A '''shambling mound''' was a large, [[animate]]d [[Plant creature|plant]] with predatory tendencies. It was also known as a '''shambler'''.

==Description==
They appeared to be moving, vaguely man-shaped mounds of rotting vegetation.

==Species==
===Serpentine===
A serpentine shambling mound was one that had been corrupted by tainted [[blueberry|blueberries]]. Their bodies were stretched so that they resembled serpents with the head and hands on one end and the legs on the other, but otherwise they had nothing in common with serpents. There were only a few of these creatures. They dwelled in the east [[starwood]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]], north of the [[Halfaxe Trail]].

==Ecology==
[[File:Shambling mound DMG14.png|thumb|300px|''A looming shambling mound.'']]
===Habitats===
Shambling mounds were often found in temperate marshlands.

In [[northwest Faerûn]], they could be found in the [[Mere of Dead Men]]{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, "the Black Death"|53}} and the [[Stump Bog]].{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}}

In [[interior Faerûn]], they could be found in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]].

In [[south Faerûn]], they could be found in the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]], occasionally in the [[Thornwood]],, occasionally in [[Chondalwood]], and wandering the jungles of [[Samarach]].

==History==
In [[1357 DR]] and up to [[1368 DR]], shambling mounds could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]].

In [[1374 DR]], the [[Shadowscale]] [[lizardfolk]] lured a shambling mound into the back entrance of their [[Shadowscale Warren|warren]] by bringing it animal carcasses. It served a dual purpose as both guardian and waste disposal. However, when they stopped feeding it (being [[undead]], they no longer needed to eat), it went off and hunted on its own, but used the area as a den. Two [[shocker lizard]]s joined it, forming a mutualist relationship: they gained the shambler's protection and ate its leavings, while their electric shocks bolstered and healed the shambler.
