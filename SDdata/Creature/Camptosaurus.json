        "mainbody": "Camptosaurus () was a species of dinosaurs.\nCamptosaurs looked like iguanodons but were smaller. \nCamptosaurs were known for being particularly dumb.  \nCamptosaurs were an easy target for predators. A herd of camptosaurs would not flee from a predator until one of them was killed. Their main defence was in the form of a stampede.\nArchelons were herbivores and lived in herds."
