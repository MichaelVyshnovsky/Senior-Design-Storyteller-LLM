        "mainbody": "Symbiont was a general term for a variety of disparate small sentient creatures that shared certain traits, chief amongst them being a need to live in a symbiotic (sometimes bordering on parasitic) relationship with another larger creature in order to survive. In exchange for these relationships, symbionts granted their hosts a variety of different benefits, in some cases acting much like a graft.\nSymbionts were always aware of any dangers that their hosts were also aware of.\nSymbionts and their hosts were both capable of casting on the other spells that had their target of effect limited to the caster themselves.\nAdditionally, the two could share their repertoire of spells with each other, even if those spells normally wouldnt affect creatures of the host or symbionts type.\nIf a host creatures alignment and goals were ever in conflict with those of a symbiont, or if a symbionts will and drive for power were exceptionally high, a conflict of personality was likely to occur between the two. Whenever this happened the host and symbiont each attempted to impose their will upon the other, winning complete control over the other for the rest of that day. This period of dominance could be cut short by the two being put in a critical situation, such as something that seriously threatened the lives of both host and symbiont.\nCerebral Symbionts\n Aberrant symbionts that possessed an assortment of psionic powers. They were theorized to have some connection to mind flayers, possibly having been created by them. These included such creatures as the cerebral hood.\nFiendish Symbionts\n Symbionts that originated in the Lower Planes. These tended more towards parasitism, siphoning off some of their hosts vitality and spiritual strength. They were sometimes attached to creatures by the same magical devices as fiendish grafts, by a fiend of corruption,\nUndead Symbionts\n Though commonly grouped together with fiendish symbionts, these creatures were undead spirits rather than outsiders from the Lower Planes.\nWhilst these creatures were generally capable of surviving on their own for some degree of time, they were by and large too physically weak to sustain such a life.\n* Haask, an elder doppelganger, was reduced to a symbiont by the Dead Three and through a ritual was fused to the outer flesh of the undying elder evil he once served, Hargut of the Gray Pestilence."
