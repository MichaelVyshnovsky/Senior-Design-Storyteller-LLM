        "Description": "Ancestral defenders appeared when the Ffolk [[spirit]]s that empowered a dragoon were stirred into action.",
        "Combat": "The spirit could not attack the dragoon's foes except by redirecting their attacks back at them. A defender's primary role in battle was to assist or heal a dragoon and their allies, however it could not act independently: the dragoon had to direct and choose its actions, and even the spirit's ability to exist on the battlefield was tied to the dragoon's own vitality.",
        "Society": "The spirit could be summoned using a [[primal]] rite known as a ''dragoon summons''. A Callidyrr dragoon focused their willpower and howled an ancient, traditional Ffolk battle cry to summon the spirit, which appeared within {{SI|25|feet|long=yes}} of the dragoon and was heralded by a chill wind. An ancestral defender lingered until it was destroyed or until the summoner dismissed it."
