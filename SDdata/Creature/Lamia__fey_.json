They could take on the form of any race or gender, though typically took on the form of either [[eladrins]], [[drow]], or [[human]]s.",
        "Personality": "Though made up of a swarm, lamias were highly intelligent collective consciousnesses that possessed some of the memories and knowledge of their first victim.
