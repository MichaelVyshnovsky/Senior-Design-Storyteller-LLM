        "mainbody": "'''Forgewraiths''' were a type of [[undead]] that arose from one or many [[humanoid]]s, usually [[evil]] in the former case, meeting their demise due to intense heat or flames in an industrial area. Most were an amalgamation of multiple weaker spirits, but those who arose from a single evil humanoid retained a soul and personality, much like a [[ghost]].",
        "Personality": "Forgewraiths delighted in consuming their enemies with fire and pain. Those that were born from a single humanoid had higher goals and could speak the languages they knew in life.",
        "Abilities": "[[Magic]]al fire did minimal damage to forgewraiths, while non-magical fire did no harm to them.",
        "History": "Following [[Mount Hotenow]]'s eruption in [[1451 DR]],  forgewraiths could be found within the [[Shadowfell]]'s reflection of it.",
