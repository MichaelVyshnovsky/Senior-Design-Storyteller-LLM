'''Ruin demons''' were massive swarms of [[demon]]ic insects that acted together to form vaguely [[humanoid]]-shaped clouds.

==Description==
The insects that made up a ruin demon all looked like black flies with an approximation of a [[human]] face.

==Ecology==
These creatures reproduced by laying masses of insectoid eggs within a corpse.
===Homelands===
Ruin demons were generally found in the [[Gaping Maw]], the [[Layers of the Abyss#88|88th layer of the Abyss]]. There they hovered over its blighted shores, stalking the dim borders of the [[Screaming Jungle]] to feast on whatever creatures they came across. The frequent storms on that layer controlled their population size, though occasionally their abyssal winds carried them to other layers.
===Languages===
Theses creatures could only speak [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]].

==History==
Ruin demons first emerged in the Brine Flats of the Gaping Maw and that is where they largely remained native to in the years following their creation.

==Notable Ruin Demons==
A dream version of the [[sorceress]] [[Iggwilv|Natasha]], created by her sister [[Elena (witch)|Elena]], brought two ruin demons out of the [[Plane of Dreams]] to act as her servants within the [[Baba Yaga's dancing hut|dancing hut]] of [[Baba Yaga]]. They were always on her person, disguised as a pair of chitin pauldrons.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/196/Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut|25}}
