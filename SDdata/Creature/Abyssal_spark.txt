Abyssal sparks were elementals of fire from the Abyss.
They looked like bright bursts of Abyssal flame that had come to life.
Abyssal sparks could use their pulsing fire to burn their foes. They were delicate and easy to destroy, but this led them to immolate in a fiery explosion. Any demon caught in this burst found itself briefly shielded from any incoming attacks, and so abyssal sparks made a point of staying nearby their demonic allies in combat.
Sparks had been encountered in swarms and alongside demons. They were known to emerge from portals to the Abyss.
