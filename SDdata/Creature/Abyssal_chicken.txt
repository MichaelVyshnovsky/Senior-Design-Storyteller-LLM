Abyssal chickens were small fiends native to the Abyss.
Abyssal chickens were small creatures. They had leather wings but were not capable of sustained flight. Their wings were folded above them, giving them a tear-shaped appearance. They had a large mouth filled with fangs and a long tongue. Abyssal chickens primary form of locomotion was their two large legs, which ended in feet resembling those of a regular chicken. Each foot had three large claws. 
Abyssal chickens used their claws and fangs to defend themselves or attack prey. They were fast runners and used their wings to increase their speed.

Native to the Abyss, abyssal chickens were also found on Avernus. They were spawned fully-grown in the Spawning Trees. The trees held fleshy sacks on their branches, and when mature they fell to the ground, breaking open.
Abyssal chickens were hunted and used as a food item. Their flesh had a taste identical to that of a fatty chicken. They were sometimes used as familiars.
