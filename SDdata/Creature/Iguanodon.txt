'''Iguanodons''' ({{Pronounce|i|GWAN|a|dan|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) were a species of [[dinosaur]].
==Description==
Iguanodons were large quadrupeds that looked somewhat like a small sauropod. When eating they rose up on their hind legs.
==Combat==
When confronted by a predator, iguanodons used their powerful legs to flee. If pressed, they defended themselves with a thumb-like spike on their hands and their strong tail.
==Biology==
Iguanodons were herbivores and lived together in herds.
