Iguanodons () were a species of dinosaur.
Iguanodons were large quadrupeds that looked somewhat like a small sauropod. When eating they rose up on their hind legs.
When confronted by a predator, iguanodons used their powerful legs to flee. If pressed, they defended themselves with a thumb-like spike on their hands and their strong tail.
Iguanodons were herbivores and lived together in herds.
