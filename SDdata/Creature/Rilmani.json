They serve only the Balance and will preserve our truce. I suggested the spire as a neutral ground where you would feel safe for just that reason.|[[Finder Wyvernspur]] to [[Beshaba]]}}",
        "Description": "Rilmani appeared [[humanoid]]s. Their skin looked metallic and their eyes emitted a pearly light. They were capable of ''polymorphing'' into almost any humanoid.",
        "Personality": "Rilmani were infamous for their aloofness, as well as their cautious and observant nature. Their innate power was such that their mere presence tended to overwhelm some creatures.",
        "Abilities": "Rilmani were extremely powerful, gifted with many innate magical abilities. Every rilmani had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[featherfall]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[sanctuary]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[tongues]]'' [[spell]]s at will. \n\nRilmani were immune to [[psionic]] attacks on the mind but remained vulnerable to telekinetic-based attacks. They were immune to electricity-based effects and spells and partially immune to acid, gas and poison-based effects and spells.",
        "Combat": "Rilmani carefully analyzed all possible consequences, and to determine if aiding or not would help bring things back into [[the Balance]], before engaging in direct combat. Rilmani would use their natural ability to ''polymorph'' to transform themselves into either a lawful or chaotic creature, depending on which action restored the Balance, before inserting themselves into combat.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Most rilmani were encountered in the [[Outlands]], usually near the [[Spire]]. Their homes were inaccessible from the [[Astral Plane]], which was why a rilmani was unable to be summoned via magic. They could be encountered anywhere within the Astral and [[Outer Planes]], but were rarely seen on the [[Prime Material plane]]. In fact their access to the Prime Material plane was restricted—they were only able to travel there if a creature of law or chaos of equal power was already present on the Prime Material plane.\n\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]], many rilmani could be found in the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]].",
            "Languages": "Rilmani spoke their own unique language, as well as [[Common]] and [[Undercommon]]. All rilmani were able to communicate telepathically with other sentient creatures, and empathically with animals.",
            "Religion": "A small number of rilmani worshiped the [[Celtic pantheon|Celtic deity]] of mountains [[Dunatis]], who claimed to be responsible for creating the infinite Spire of the Outlands.",
            "Relationships": "Rilmani sometimes acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity]] [[Thoth]]. They would be sent by him to do his bidding or to make known his approval or disapproval."
        },
        "History": "In the distant past, the rilmani discovered the library of [[Timaresh]], at that time still guarded by the [[kamerel]], who, though also beings of neutrality, were xenophobic and loathed contact with any other peoples. The rilmani thought that the knowledge held in Timaresh would help them maintain the Balance and so fought the kamerel for it, in a series of conflicts that ended when the kamerel vanished completely.<ref>\n\nAs of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], a single [[aurumach]] and several [[ferrumach|ferrumach rilmani]] composed one of the three groups connected to the final seal in the fifth level of [[Watcher's Keep]]. Unlike other instances, these rilmani could be summoned to [[Toril]] when the ''spirit key'' was used to unlock one third of the keep's seal."
