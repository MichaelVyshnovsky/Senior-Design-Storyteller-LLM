Utahraptors were a large species of carnivorous dinosaurs found in Chult.
Similar in appearance to deinonychus but much larger, utahraptors stood upright on two legs with a large tail for balance. They had  claws on their feet, as well as razor-sharp teeth and arms ending in  long claws. They had excellent natural camouflage, with brown skin with green striping.
An attacking utahraptor was vicious and brutal. Their teeth and claws caused horrible damage. The claws on their feet were sharp enough to eviscerate a creature. They were strong and agile. They used their camouflage to attack prey in ambush attacks. Their legs were very powerful, allowing them to leap up to  high, up to  if they had a running start. They had a natural immunity to fear-based spells.
Utahraptors were pack animals. Their packs were matriarchal, with the strongest and largest female as leader. They co-operated with each other and coordinated their attacks. They were territorial and very protective of their young.
Utahraptors lived in dense forests or jungles. Their diet consisted purely of meat.
