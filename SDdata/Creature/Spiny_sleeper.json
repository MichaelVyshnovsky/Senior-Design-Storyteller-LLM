        "mainbody": "Spiny sleepers were a very rare species of fish found in the Great Glacier.\nThis plump fish was covered in tiny silver spines and had a white belly and long whiskers resembling a catfish. Handling the sleeper without proper care, such as not wearing gloves or protective gear, may result in one of the spines piercing the flesh and injecting a potent toxin. If the affected, they experienced effects similar to a temporal stasis spell, and their body would be covered in an ice-like glaze. The effect could be negated by neutralize poison or similar spells, as well as specific herbal treatments known by certain Ulutiun healers.\nSpiny sleepers displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.\nSpiny sleepers were scavengers. They consumed plankton, organic waste and any organic material.\nSpiny sleepers inhabited the rivers and seas of the Great Glacier. Spiny sleepers were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands."
