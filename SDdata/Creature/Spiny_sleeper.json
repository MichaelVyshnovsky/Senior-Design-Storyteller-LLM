        "mainbody": "'''Spiny sleepers''' were a very rare species of [[fish]] found in the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "This plump fish was covered in tiny silver spines and had a white belly and long whiskers resembling a [[catfish]]. Handling the sleeper without proper care, such as not wearing gloves or protective gear, may result in one of the spines piercing the flesh and injecting a potent toxin. If the affected, they experienced effects similar to a ''[[temporal stasis]]'' spell, and their body would be covered in an ice-like glaze. The effect could be negated by ''[[neutralize poison]]'' or similar spells, as well as specific herbal treatments known by certain [[Ulutiun]] healers.",
        "Behavior": "Spiny sleepers displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitat": "Spiny sleepers inhabited the rivers and seas of the [[Great Glacier]]. Spiny sleepers were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands."
