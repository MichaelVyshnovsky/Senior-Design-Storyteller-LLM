Brown bears on average were 9 ft (2.7 m) and weighed 1800 lb (816.5 kg).\nGrizzly bears were reconsidered to be a much larger and much more territorial variant of an ordinary brown bear. They were significantly more dangerous especially if challenged or threatened.\nThese omnivore ursoids were very dangerous and territorial. Brown bears that had very aggressive dispositions were known as grizzly bears.\nThey inhabited and thrived within dark glades of the Norths many forests.\nIn the areas outside of Daggerford, namely in the Western Farmlands, aggressive and dangerous grizzly bears were known to inhabit burrows and caves not far from the Delimbiyr River.\nIn the Unapproachable East, brown bears could be found in the forests and along the coasts of Rashemen.\nSome were known to live within the Dustwall Mountains between Durpar and Raurin.\nAn awakened brown bear lived on the Wyllowwood level of Undermountain.\nMaerovyna, a druid of Chauntea who led the Harvest House in Daggerford in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, was served by two pixies, a grizzly bear, and a leopard who were ready to defend her with their lives.\n* Bluster"
