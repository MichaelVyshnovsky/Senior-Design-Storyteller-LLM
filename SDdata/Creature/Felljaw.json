        "mainbody": "elljaws were a savage species of dragonspawn native to Abeir.\nFelljaws resembled large, slate-grey serpents with dragon-like heads and scales that resembled interlocking stone plates.\nFelljaws were sometimes described as the wolves of the Underdark for their pack behavior, but were only a little more intelligent than such beasts.\nFelljaws possessed darkvision and were capable climbers. Although they did not have a breath weapon like true dragons, they were resistant to fire and could set enemies they bit on fire.\nFelljaws preferred to attack in groups, and would team up to tear enemies apart.\nFelljaws were natives of the Abeiran Underdark.\nLike other Abeiran dragonspawn, felljaws were said to be the descendants of dragons and some other creature, in their case probably black dragons and fire titans."
