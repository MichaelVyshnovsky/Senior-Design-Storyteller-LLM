        "Abilities": "Felljaws possessed [[darkvision]] and were capable climbers. Although they did not have a breath weapon like [[true dragon]]s, they were resistant to fire and could set enemies they bit on fire.",
        "Combat": "Felljaws preferred to attack in groups, and would team up to tear enemies apart.",
        "Ecology": "Felljaws were natives of the [[Abeiran Underdark]].\n\nLike other Abeiran dragonspawn, felljaws were said to be the descendants of dragons and some other creature, in their case probably [[black dragon]]s and [[fire titan]]s."
