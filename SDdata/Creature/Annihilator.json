        "mainbody": "Annihilators were aberrations found in the Lowerdark.\nThe annihilators appearance resembled that of a rust monster, but had an additional set of large flexible antennae and lacked a mouth.\nAnnihilators found gratification in disintegrating both creatures and objects.\nThe antennae of an annihilator disintegrated a target. Physical contact was required and the effect was identical to that of a disintegrate spell. When an annihilator selected a target, it became obsessed with its disintegration and they were known to pursue a target over great distances.\nAnnihilators gained sustenance by absorbing disintegrated material"
