        "mainbody": "onitor lizards were a species of large carnivorous reptiles.\nThese lizards could be aggressive, using their jaws to attack enemies or tear at prey. \nMany monitor lizards were quite capable swimmers and silent stalkers.\nThese creatures could be found in northwest Faerûn, in the swamp known as the Mere of Dead Men, as well as the Eastern Shaar of southeast Faerûn.\nMonitor lizards were sometimes tamed by troglodytes for use as guard animals of their warrens.\nDuring the mid–14 century DR, the  Ginger Palace on the Dragon Coast boasted an outdoor reptile park that was home to several monitor lizards."
