        "mainbody": "'''Vultures''' were a common species of bird.",
        "Description": "Vultures were large birds with filthy feathers. Their main distinguishing feature was their featherless pink head.",
        "Behavior": "Vultures were considered to be cowardly animals. Upon sighting anything on the ground that appeared injured or dead, a vulture would quickly swoop down to investigate.",
        "Biology": "Vultures had an acute, long distance vision.{{Cite dragon/200/Familiar Faces|33}} Their keen eyesight is comparable to that of any [[eagle]], [[falcon]], or [[hawk]]. Being carrion eaters, they developed the ability to consume infected, poisoned or rotting meat safely.\n\nA female vulture could lay up to four eggs at a time. These eggs were incubated over a period of two months until they hatched. A young vulture could fly at four months of age.",
        "Combat": "Vultures were scavengers, attacking prey only once it has died or collapsed from exhaustion. Vultures only attacked moving prey if in a group, and only if the prey was already near collapsing.",
        "Species": {
            "Bone vulture": "A relative of the common desert vulture, this species had feathers that were as white as bones. They were endemic to the [[Western Heartlands]] battlefield, [[Battle of Bones]].",
            "High Ice Condor": "Otherwise known by locals as \"great soarers,\" were a species of vulture native to the arctic region [[High Ice]]. They were largely identical to their temperate cousins, though were covered in white feathers.",
            "White-bearded vulture": "These great vultures were native to [[Anauroch]] desert and were called \"[[N'asr]]'s children\" by the [[Bedine]]."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Diets": "These creatures were carrion eaters. They fed upon creatures that were either injured or already dead. Though they were also liable to attack creatures that were unconscious, restrained, or sleeping.",
            "Habitats": "Vultures typically inhabited high altitudes, such as mountains, within temperate or tropical regions. They were usually encountered in warm areas, floating on updrafts over open spaces.\n\nIn the [[Hordelands]] they could be found in the [[Katakoro Plateau]], the  [[Raurin]] and [[Quoya Desert]]s, and among its many mountain ranges.\n\nIn the [[Zakhara]] region's [[Crowded Sea]], they could be found on the island chain of [[Nada al-Hazan]] and the archipelago of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], vultures could be found in the [[plane]] of [[Acheron]].",
            "Relationships": "Vultures were a symbol and [[favored animal]] of [[Thasmudyan]], the god of undeath in the [[Zakharan pantheon]]. [[Evil]] [[swanmay]]s sometimes shapechanged into the form of a vulture.{{Cite dragon/218/The Ecology of the Bird Maiden|76-80,94}}\n\nBedine believed that vultures served N'asr. They spied on his behalf and ferried spirits to the Camp of the Dead.",
            "Usages": "The bones and feathers of a vulture were used as [[material component]]s in the casting of some [[spell]]s."
