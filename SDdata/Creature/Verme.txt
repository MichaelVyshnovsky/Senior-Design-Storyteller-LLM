Verme were a very rare, exceptionally large species of fish.
Verme largely resembled giant catfish, but were covered in large, thick scales coated in slime. Their heads in particular were heavily scaled, as well as very bony, with mouths full of hundreds of needle-like teeth. Their undersides were a pale shade of yellow, with the flanks shading from dark brown to a mottled green and brown back.
On average, a verme grew to be  in length. Their bodies were flattish along the belly and wider than they were tall.
Verme had a basic, animal-level of intellect. They expressed no surprise when spoken to through the spell speak with animals, only irritation that they were being kept from eating.
Due to the thickness of their scales and coating of slime, it was very difficult to harm a verme with edged weaponry. Because of their tendency to swallow prey whole, their stomachs often contained items of an indigestible nature.
Due to their flattish bodies, verme typically lurked along the bottom of reasonably shallow rivers. When attacking prey they would attempt to swallow it whole, even creatures as large as water buffalos.
Verme were a carnivorous species of fish. They were quite voracious, known to prey upon almost anything, including other fish, reptiles, cattle, and humans.
Verme typically inhabited large rivers of almost any climate, but typically those of warm regions. Some would also venture into bodies of saltwater. They preferred locales with an abundance of prey.
They could be found in many of the tropical, subtropical, and temperate bodies of fresh water in Kara-Tur.
In the Underdark of the Bloodstone Lands, they could be found in a body of water in the Deepearth known as the Darksea.
Due to their gargantuan size, verme often upset boats and ships up to the size of small galleys when searching for food. Because of their voracious hunger, they often caused ecological disasters and the destruction of riverside economies wherever they settled.
Adventurer groups occasionally hunted verme for their dorsal fins, which could be powdered and used as one ingredient in the ink for a shield spell. Beyond that, their scales could supply enough material components for several dozen spells.
