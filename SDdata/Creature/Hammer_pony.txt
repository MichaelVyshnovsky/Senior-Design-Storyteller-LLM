The '''hammer pony''' was a breed of [[horse|war pony]] that originated from the [[gold dwarf]] realm of the [[Great Rift]] in the [[Shining South]]. They were bred for their strength and endurance in battle and were just as comfortable underground, even in the [[Underdark]], or above on [[Toril]]'s surface.

They were not well known beyond the [[Shaar]] and were not often sold beyond the dwarven trading town, [[Hammer and Anvil]]. While they were sold for 400 [[gp]] within the settlement, they could go for as much as 1200 gold pieces in a shop outside the Shaar.

==Description==
Large and muscular in appearance, for a pony that is, they were able to support the full weight of a [[dwarf]] armored in [[plate mail]]. While they ranged in color from a light brown to black, they always had blonde manes and feathering around their ankles.

Although they would eat grass, as all horses would, their favorite food was [[fungus]].
