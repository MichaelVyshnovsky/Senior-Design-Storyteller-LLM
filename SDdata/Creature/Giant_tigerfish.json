        "mainbody": "Giant tigerfish were a species of predatory fish that inhabited inland waterways of Chult in southwest Faer√ªn.\nThe name \"tigerfish\" was not a reference to the fishs appearance, but rather its behavior it was said to have the ferocity of a tiger.\nGiant tigerfish were one of the deadliest predators in the River Soshenstar. They hunted kapenta fish, which were common near the mouth of Chults rivers near Port Nyanzaru. As such, giant tigerfish were known to attack Chultan fishers as they angled for kapenta.\nDuring the Amnian occupation of Port Nyanzaru in the 15 century DR, foreign sport fishers were known to travel to Chult seeking to land a giant tigerfish."
