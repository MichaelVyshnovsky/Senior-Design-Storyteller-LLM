        "mainbody": "'''Giant tigerfish''' were a species of predatory [[fish]] that inhabited inland waterways of [[Chult]] in [[southwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "The name \"tigerfish\" was not a reference to the fish's appearance, but rather its behavior: it was said to have the ferocity of a [[tiger]].",
        "Ecology": "Giant tigerfish were one of the deadliest predators in the [[River Soshenstar]]. They hunted [[kapenta]] fish, which were common near the mouth of Chult's rivers near [[Port Nyanzaru]]. As such, giant tigerfish were known to attack [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] fishers as they angled for kapenta.",
        "History": "During the [[Amn]]ian occupation of Port Nyanzaru in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], foreign sport fishers were known to travel to Chult seeking to land a giant tigerfish."
