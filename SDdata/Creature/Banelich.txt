Baneliches were liches who served as clerics of Bane during their mortal lives.
Baneliches looked and acted the same as others of their kind, but they continued to worship Bane in undeath.
They shared the same immunities as regular liches, and wielded powers such as paralyzing attacks and the aura of fear they put forth.
Baneliches retained most of their clerical powers from life, and continued to garner more power in undeath, achieving new heights every hundred years or so.

Most baneliches were destroyed in the , when followers of Iyachtu Xvim released the Tyrantfog across northern and central Faer√ªn. Those that survived carried on with the plots and plans they had developed.
