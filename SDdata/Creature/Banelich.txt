'''Baneliches''' were [[lich]]es who served as [[cleric]]s of [[Bane]] during their mortal lives.

==Personality==
Baneliches looked and acted the same as others of their kind, but they continued to worship Bane in [[undeath]].

==Abilities==
They shared the same immunities as regular liches, and wielded powers such as ''[[paralytic touch|paralyzing attacks]]'' and the ''[[fear aura|aura of fear]]'' they put forth.

Baneliches retained most of their clerical powers from life, and continued to garner more power in [[undeath]], achieving new heights every hundred years or so.

==History==
[[File:Banelich MCA3.png|thumb|right|250px|A banelich ''circa'' the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].]]
Dismayed by the number of his followers who were slain by agents of [[good]], Bane took direct action beginning in the time not long after his apotheosis. Every half century or so, Bane would reveal to his most powerful [[priest]] the method in which they could serve him for eternity as a banelich.

Over the centuries, about 35 of his priests underwent the process to become a Banelich. Only ten of them were accurately identified by others in the Realms.

Most baneliches were destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, when followers of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] released the [[Tyrantfog]] across [[North Faerûn|northern]] and [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]]. Those that survived carried on with the plots and plans they had developed.

==Notable Baneliches==
* [[Stallac Benadi]]: This fervent priest served Bane as his first [[High Imperceptor of Bane|High Imperceptor]] during the 9{{th}} century [[DR]]
*[[Algashon Nathaire]]  the First Interpreter for  Cult of the Dragon in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}
