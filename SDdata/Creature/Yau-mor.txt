'''Yau-mor''' were lesser spirits found in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Yau-mor appeared as freakish monstrosities. They had the torso of a [[human]] male and the head and legs of a small [[dragon]]. Their heads sported multiple eyes, ranging from a single eye to four. Their skin was a sickly shade of green.

==Personality==
Yau-mor relished combat and destruction, so much so that it often distracted them from their duties. They obeyed orders well enough but were easily manipulated by more intelligent beings.

==Combat==
Yau-mor despised any spellcaster and sought to attack them whenever possible. Due to their low intelligence, a yau-mor was only able to detect a spellcaster once a spell was cast. Once they choose a target, they ignored all other threats until that specific target was eliminated.

==Abilities==
The yau-mor's signature attack was being able to shout a {{SI|30|ft}} stream of fire from its mouth. It caused considerable damage and ignited any combustible material. A yau-mor used this ability sparingly as it caused them great pain.

==Society==
Yau-mor were servants of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], performing tasks for the evil-aligned members of the Bureaucracy. When encountered in Kara-Tur, a yau-mor was usually in the midst of a mission for the Celestial Bureaucracy. They were tasked with missions that were either tiresome and dangerous for a more competent being to undertake.
