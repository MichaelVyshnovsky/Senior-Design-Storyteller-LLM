Topaz dragons were a breed of gem dragon known to be selfish and unsociable and for their similarity to topaz.
When a wyrmling, a topaz dragon had scales that were dull yellow with orange highlights. while they brightened in color, with individual scales becoming indiscernible. and sparkled under the sun and from far off they appeared as if carved from pure topaz. Conversely, their pupils faded with age, so a great wyrms eyes were naught but fiery glowing orbs.
A hatchling had a  body and  tail, while an adult had a body length of  and a tail length of . The biggest great wyrms grew to  long in the body, with tails  long.
While not really malevolent, they were selfish and unfriendly, with no interest in meeting others or in having others meet them. They often behaved erratically and this made them unpleasant and even dangerous to deal with. 
Topaz dragons breathed a cone of dehydration, ironically resembling a blast of water. or  long and up to  wide. Living creatures caught in the blast would be severely dehydrated,
Topaz dragons were naturally immune to cold spells and could breathe water as well as they could air.
Like any dragon, and in addition to the common powers of gem dragons, topaz dragons gained an array of magical powers as they aged, though accounts of these varied. Alternatively, adults could create a fog cloud thrice a day, old dragons could control winds thrice a day, and ancient dragons could control weather once a day. If psionic, juveniles could featherfall, old dragons could control air rather than control winds, and great wyrms could shape change.
Similarly, topaz dragons could acquire and cast new spells of their own, whether arcane or divine, but they were most noted for their talent in psionics. Those who were so gifted learned the psionic attacks mind thruster and id insinuation or ego whip and the psionic defenses mind blank or thought shield and mental barrier.
They were skilled in swimming, hiding, and survival.

Topaz dragons were disinterested in parenting. They would even abandon their own offspring in order to save themselves.
Lairing near the coast as they did, they favored a seafood diet, preying on fish, shark, and particularly giant squid.
Topaz dragons spoke Draconic
Like the rest of the gem dragons, topaz dragons were rarer in the Realms than the common chromatic and metallic dragons.
Occupying the same or similar environments, topaz dragons and bronze dragons regularly quarreled. Their battles were invariably violent and lethal.
Topaz dragons made their lairs by the sea, in bleak and rocky coastal areas such as secluded beaches, caves above or below the waterline, or structures they built themselves.
In spite of this, topaz dragons did not actually enjoy the water as their bronze dragon neighbors did. In fact, they had little liking of it and swam only as necessary for hunting and battle. They kept their lairs scrupulously dry,
Topaz dragons were most often found in the Elemental Plane of Water., and they only made short visits to the Prime Material Plane.
In the Unapproachable East, topaz dragons could be found around the coastal regions of Aglarond.
Topazes were among the different kinds of dragon known to lair near the Smokeholes for their warmth, at least temporarily while travelling over the High Ice.
While they did not like visitors or trespassers to their lairs, topaz dragons also did not like fighting. In fact, while they avoided conversing at the best of times, they would do so to prevent a fight and to conceal their magical and psionic preparations. When trespassers proved hostile, or just uninteresting or annoying, the topaz dragon would strike first if it could. If outside, it would use its powers to control wind and weather, before entering melee. If inside, it often began with its dehydrating breath instead.
If outmatched, a topaz dragon might propose or pretend to surrender to buy itself time, and if overwhelmed it would retreat. However, some retreats were feigned, and the topaz dragon would return to surprise its attacker.
A talon of a topaz dragon was reported to be one of many draconic material components in Ossavitors Way, a magical means by which a dragon could attain immortality.
The brain and/or cranial fluids of a topaz dragon was one proposed ingredient in the long-sought-after universal material component.
