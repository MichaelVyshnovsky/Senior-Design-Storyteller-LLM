        "mainbody": "A '''balhiir''' was a magic-absorbing creature from the [[negative Energy plane]].\n\n{{quote|''Tell ye of the balhiir? Ah, a curious creature, indeed. I hear it was firstâ€”the short version, ye say. Very well, ye are paying. The short version is thus: a curious creature, indeed. Thank ye, goodsir, fair day to ye.''|The sage [[Rasthiavar]] of [[Iriaebor]], ''[[A Wayfarer's Belt-Book of Advice]]'', {{yearlinkName|1282}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|7|117}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|7|114}}}}",
        "Description": "Balhiir appeared to be softly-glowing clouds with sparkles of light within, about {{SI|6|feet|long=yes}}.",
        "Behavior": "Balhiir approached concentrations of magic, and consumed them by simple contact. In their home [[Negative Energy plane]], they could also consume other forms of energy. It was believed that if balhiir had a guiding intelligence, it had to be too alien to comprehend.",
        "Abilities": "On their own, balhiir possessed little power beyond that which they had to absorb energy. When they absorbed too much, they eliminated the excess as heat and light. They could pass through any aperture over {{SI|1|inch|m|long=yes}} in diameter in their search for energy; they supped on magic by simple contact, steadily draining the energy from items.The distance is shown in \"inches\" and assumed to refer to tactical distances as default in AD&D 1e. Given the reference to obstacles such as solid rock, indoors distances are assumed. In such distances, 1\" refers to 10'. away, even through solid rock; it also passively absorbed any magic unleashed within {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} of it.",
        "Combat": "Balhiir were very difficult to engage in combat, as no physical weapon could harm them. The usual method to strike them down involved the use of too many spells of too much power cast quickly enough to overwhelm their ability to absorb and release energy safely. They could also be bound with magic, in which case their behaviours were modified.\n\nIn their home plane, balhiir were capable of absorbing lifeforce as well as magic.",
        "Ecology": "Those that became bound to an object were believed to change behaviour upon release, and that it was only those who released them that could bind them again. A person who released a balhiir somehow could also bind them into themselves, and attempt to absorb their power; upon doing so, if they did not immediately die from absorbing the balhiir's power, they'd temporarily gain the ability to unleash [[spellfire]]. They were at risk of death again once the balhiir's power ran out, however.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|115-117|7}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|117-120|7}}\n\nBalhiir that ran out of power went into hibernation. Some sages suspected they may have been the natural predator of the [[xeg-yi]].",
        "History": "The usual way of destroying a balhiir, per [[Elminster]], required five mages tearing it apart telekinetically; the process likely killed many of them.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|132_133|8}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|137|8}}\n\n[[Erimmator]], a mage of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], bound a balhiir to an enemy mage, [[Garthond Shessair]], on or around {{yearlink|1339}}If Shandril is 17 winters old at the end of ''Spellfire'', she would have been conceived sometime around 1339. for the purpose of draining his foe's magic.{{cite book/Heroes' Lorebook|47}} Years later, [[Elminster]] came to suspect it was an experiment to test whether Garthond's offspring would be born with the ability to unleash spellfire.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|356-357|16}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|365-366|20}}\n\n[[Shandril Shessair]] released a balhiir in {{yearlink|1357}} from a [[balhiir-globe]]{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|121|7}} she smashed into the face of the [[Shadowsil]], an enemy sorceress, while trapped in the lair of the [[dracolich]] [[Rauglothgor]]; the balhiir then disrupted the magic of the sorceress, the dracolich, the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], and of [[Narm Tamaraith]].{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|23}} The balhiir was recognized by [[Florin Falconhand]], who also revealed the superstition only the one who released the balhiir could slay it.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|102-108, 110|6}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|101-106, 112-115|6}} The balhiir also annihilated the dracolich's phylactery,{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/01-21 - The Dracoliches in Spellfire}} and much of the magic in the hoard.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|146|9}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|153|9}} Prompted by [[Elminster]] and with the aid of Narm Tamaraith, who employed the ''[[belch]]'' cantrip upon her to draw the balhiir's attention, she bound it back upon herself,{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|115-117|7}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|117-120|7}} awakening her latent spellfire in the process.\n\nThe Shadowsil escaped and warned [[Aghazstamn]] of the balhiir, when seeking his aid against the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|128|8}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|132|8}} After the battle, Elminster was surprised by the power the balhiir had absorbed,{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|121|}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|125|}} but then judged Shandril released far more power than the creature could have possibly been holding;{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|199|11}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|208|12}} he later confirmed she became able to use spellfire independently of the balhiir.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|233|12}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|244|14}}"
