        "mainbody": "Jabberwock were illusive dragon-like creatures that could be found in the Feywild.\nSince only a small percentage of people who came into contact with jabberwocks survived the experience, and even fewer were unaffected by the creatures confusing burbling, it was difficult to give accurate accounts of them. It was described as a sinewy, dragon-like monster that moved on all four legs as effortlessly as on its hind legs. A jabberwock could reach the length of  with its tail adding additional  to its size.\nOne eyewitness accord managed to capture one of the more reliable descriptions of a jabberwock. It was reported to have a thick draconic torso, powerful hind legs, and sinuous front paws, each ending with four feathery taloned fingers. Some sages believed that these feathery growths were a type of parasitic moss. Each talon was about  long. Their bodies were covered in scales the color of tarnished golds and browns. They had a long anguiform neck, a massive head, a pair of leathery wings, and a freakishly long tail. Their heads had two large menacing yellow eyes and red pupils, covered by semitransparent eyelids. Jabberwocks orbs glowed in the dark â€“ a blood-chilling sight in a dark forest. The eyes were also the most vulnerable part of the monster.\nJabberwock was a fearsome foe. It was immune to to all poisons, fear, charm, and could only be harmed by arms enchanted with vorpal magics. Non vorpal weapons were capable of damaging the creature but could not deal lethal damage. To make them even more dangerous, jabberwock possessed a powerful regenerative ability. However, it could be slowed by successfully slashing into the beasts flesh. The beasts eyes observed the world in truesight that reached  around them. Despite only appearing to be dragons in a loose superficial sense, jabberwock was surrounded by a powerful aura of fear. They also possessed a powerful resistance to most types of magic.\nLike many other predators, they had a powerful, if not supernatural, ability to track prey. If a creature was wounded by a jabberwock, it could track the victim with ease for 24 hours.\nJabberwock was in a state of constant confusing burbling to itself. These insane murmurings affected any creature that was within earshot, usually within  but reach up to . Those who were unfortunate enough to hear a jabberwock were affected by hallucinations, compelled to run in a random direction, stay stunned and dazed, or attack a random creature within sight, be they a friend or foe. The confusion was much more powerful than the effects of the spell of the same name and lasted as long as the creature remained within the jabberwocks territory. Additionally, those affected lost their ability to clearly communicate with each other as if affected by the babble spell.\nDespite its predatory nature, jabberwock was a curious creature that lacked the instinct to hoard treasure, common among true dragons. Another similarity was their ability to fly, but they rarely did so as jabberwock preferred to lay in waiting, hidden by vegetation or among treetops.\nWhen a jabberwock descended on a target, it focused all of its attacks on that individual until the target was either dead (and consumed), the jabberwock was eliminated, or the target managed to flee using teleportation magic or another method. Unlike other dragons and related beings, jabberwock emitted flaming rays of fire from their eyes or rays of paralyzation magic.\nA jabberwock was a lone, erratic predator that prowled wild woodlands and abandoned or ruined sites. The creature was fiercely territorial that did not hesitate to slay anyone brave or stupid enough to tray into jabberwocks territory.Every time a jabberwock was killed, another specimen mysteriously materialized after a period of time between 2 and 24 years within  of the previous jabberwocks body. Their supernatural nature was discerned from the fact that no young jabberwock had ever been witnessed, nor living jabberwock were known to age. Some believed that just like a tarrasque, there existed only one creature, the Jabberwock.\nMost living beings were nothing but food to a jabberwock. Druids were the only exception as the beast left the servants of the forest alone. A certain wise sage proposed a theory that a jabberwock was created by the forests, as its defender, a manifestation of a sort of an anti-body. Only the biggest and most ancient untarnished forests were thought to be able to spawn a jabberwock."
