'''Doll golems''' were a type of [[construct]] made from a singular child's toy, most often a doll or [[stuffed animal]]. They were often created in order to either protect children or infiltrate their homes and attack them,{{Cite organized play/LC/The Call of the Wilde/Round Two|15}}

==Personality==
These constructs were mindless, lacking any high form of intelligence.

==Abilities==
When doll golems bit a victim there was a chance that they would induce an effect akin to the [[spell]] ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', compelling their victim to continually laugh until they either died from an inability to breath or were treated with ''[[dispel magic]]''. Like most golems the were largely impervious to [[magic]]al attacks, though [[fire]]-based spells could partially harm them. The ''[[warp wood]]'' spell imparted an effect similar to ''[[slow]]'' upon them. And ''[[mending]]'' could largely heal any damage that was done to them.

==Variants==
;Zhent Doll Golem: By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] the [[Zhentarim]] were occasionally making doll golems that had the unique ability to identify on sight if someone was a true worshiper of either [[Bane]] or [[Cyric]]. This unique trait allowed Zhents to identify and eliminate double agents and non-worshipers in their midst's. They were also distinct from other doll golems in that they had an average level of intellect and [[alignment|aligned]] towards [[evil]].

==Notable Doll Golems==
* [[Audrey]], a Zhent doll golem that was not evil due to being partially defective.
* [[Cuddle]], a stuffed bear doll golem that belonged to [[Callie]] of [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Raison d'ÃŠtre|4}}
* '''Lady Katharine''', a doll golem that was created by the [[air]] [[elementalist]] [[Mortimer Lightfoot]] to be a life-sized duplicate of Lady [[Katharine Blacktree]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Air's Looking at You|17-18}}

==Ecology==
Doll golems generally took around two months to construct.

==History==
Beyond [[Toril]] these golems could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]. There the first record instances of them were in a domain called [[w:c:ravenloft:Sanguinia|Sanguinia]]. It was seen in the hands of a traveling [[priest]], whose name was long forgotten. According to legends he had created the doll golem to protect his wife and daughter as they traveled through the land.
