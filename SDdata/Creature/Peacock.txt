'''Peacocks''' were a species of bird found in the Realms.

{{quote|...After all, a peacock was merely a [[pigeon]] with the right feathers added to its tail.|[[Ulia Mannicci]], the First Lady of [[Sumbria]]}}

==Description==
The shrieks of these birds sounded vaguely [[human]]-like.

==History==
[[File:CerautEstate.png|thumb|273px|''Some of the Ceraut Estate's peacocks.'']]
Several decades prior to [[1368 DR]], an eccentric nobleman by the name of Lord [[Ceraut]] imported a small flock of peacocks to [[Ceraut Estate|his estate]] in [[Furthinghome]]. As his estate fell into disrepair the peacocks made their way out into the countryside, until by 1368 DR they had grown to a large population that was breeding unrestrained.

In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold individual peacock feathers for one [[gold piece]] each.

In the late-15{{th}} century DR, the [[Baldur's Gate/Outer City|Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] had a burgeoning peacock-breeding
industry. Around that time the [[Helm and Cloak]] served peacock meat.

==Ecology==
===Homelands===
Peacocks were one of the many species of bird kept within the fortress [[Sarahin]]'s [[Garden of Delights]].{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|26}} In [[Maztica]], peacocks could be found in [[Payit]].<ref> In [[Kara-tur]], peacocks could be found throughout tropical forest regions and within the [[Valley of Wings]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/8/The Flowers of Flame|55}}

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], peacocks could be found in [[Siamorphe]]'s [[divine realm]] in the [[House of the Triad]].

===Usages===
Peacocks were one of the many exotic animals transported by caravans across the [[Endless Wastes]].<ref>

In the town of [[Yhep]], the attendants of the [[Open Oyster]] inn were known to fan patrons with peacock feathers.

[[Thomas C. Quirkilious]] of the [[Chromatic Scale]] instrument shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] experimented with using peacock gizzards to make [[lute]] strings. The experiment was a gross failure.

==Rumors & Legends==
In the land of Kara-Tur, peacocks were often associated with foretelling the future. Some primitive tribes in Kara-Tur believed that there existed a mystic link between peacocks and some species of [[fish]] that were also associated with fortune telling.

==Trivia==
* One of the three gates of the city of [[Dihliz]] was known as the Peacock Gate.
* Peacocks were one of the many forms that [[gendruwo]] were capable of [[shapechange|shapeshifting]] into.
* The sultan of [[Sudolphoor]] had a summer home known as the [[Peacock House]], named for the peacocks that he kept within its garden.
* Members of the [[Cities of the Pantheon|Pantheist]]s across the [[Golden Gulf]] frequently referred to the citizens of the [[Pearl Cities]] as "peacocks" for their ostentatious clothes.
* In the land of Zakhara, the [[spirit]]s of some deceased took the form of [[hama|spectral peacocks]].
