        "Description": "A rot troll's flesh peeled off from the skin as soon as it formed, and the troll's body withered constantly.",
        "Abilities": "Unlike a normal troll, a rot troll eventually lost its ability to regenerate, but it still healed properly. The monster was pulsing with necrotic energy, which was emitted from its withering shape.",
        "Combat": "Due to a rot troll's rancid degeneration, standing too close to it exposed other creatures to its deadly emanations. Only [[acid]] or fire could stop this necrotic radiation.",
        "Creation": "During regeneration, a normal troll could become infected with waves of necrotic energy and form a symbiotic connection with that deathly force.",
        "Habitats": "Rot trolls could be found in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]."
