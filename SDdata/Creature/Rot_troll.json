        "mainbody": "ot trolls were a type of troll imbued with necrotic energy.\nA rot trolls flesh peeled off from the skin as soon as it formed, and the trolls body withered constantly.\nUnlike a normal troll, a rot troll eventually lost its ability to regenerate, but it still healed properly. The monster was pulsing with necrotic energy, which was emitted from its withering shape.\nDue to a rot trolls rancid degeneration, standing too close to it exposed other creatures to its deadly emanations. Only acid or fire could stop this necrotic radiation.\nDuring regeneration, a normal troll could become infected with waves of necrotic energy and form a symbiotic connection with that deathly force.\nRot trolls could be found in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North."
