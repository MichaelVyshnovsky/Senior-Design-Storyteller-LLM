The dracosphinx was a desert-dwelling hybrid creature related to red dragons, possibly created from a merging of a red dragon and an androsphinx. They were not truly related to sphinxes, being only named as such due to their body structure being so similar.
Much like true sphinxes, dracosphinxes had winged leonine bodies. The head, front paws, wings, and upper body was covered in red scales reminiscent of red dragons, while colorful feathers surrounded their head.
When not hunting, the dracosphinx could be found sunning itself in the hot desert sun, or in search of obscure information. They were also philosophers, though their ideals tended to favor stronger creatures over weaker ones. They seemed to enjoy nothing more than engaging intelligent beings in riddle contests and sly conversation, setting their opponent up for sudden, cunning attack. Above all, dracosphinxes possessed the same greed for monetary treasure as dragons, and would do anything to possess it.
In combat, a dracosphinx attacked with its large dragon claws and bites. They used their powerful breath to dispose of foes, after using their illusions to give prey a false sense of security.
These creatures were actually egg-laying mammals, who mated once in a lifetime. They were incapable of mating with any true sphinxes.
Dracosphinxes were a sly, predatory species, roaming the desert highlands in search of all sorts of prey.
These creatures preferred to lair in bleak cliff sides, where they had an excellent vantage point of their hunting territory.
Dracosphinx spoke both Common and the same dialect of Draconic as red dragons.
Their main enemy was the stupid and far more numerous hieracosphinx. Though dragons, humans, and sometimes wyverns also served as territorial problems for dracosphinxes.
