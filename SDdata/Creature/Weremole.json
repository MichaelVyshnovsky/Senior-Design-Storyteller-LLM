        "mainbody": "A weremole was a type of lycanthrope that could take the form of a monstrous giant mole. This strain of lycanthropy was thought to only affect gnomes and it was caused by the bloodthirsty gnomish deity Urdlen, the Crawler Below, and weremoles were its savage servants.\nResembling their savage god, a weremole could shift into the form of a monstrous giant mole, some  in length. It was hairless with dead-white skin, and had an enormous pair of claws.Though Demihuman Deities does not use the \"dire\" appellation, only calling it a \"giant mole\", Shining South and Serpent Kingdoms call the members of the Blood Screamers \"dire weremoles\". Therefore, it assumed that the giant mole is a dire mole. Neither giant moles nor dire moles have been presented outside the weremole.\nWhile in giant mole form, a weremole was completely blind, yet made up for it with extraordinary senses. When above ground, they were able to sense any creature in contact with the earth up to  away. Moreover, when below ground, they were able to sense any creature around them as well as they might see in full light, up to a distance of . Regardless, they remained oblivious to flying creatures, and were vulnerable to them.\nThey retained all the traditional abilities and powers of gnomes. In addition, weremoles could converse with any small burrowing creature to as big as an osquip. Furthermore, they had an innate ability to command them, similar to a suggestion spell, once a day. They could also call up a horde of burrowing creatures to obey them, similar to summon swarm, once a day.\nAs lycanthropes, they could only be harmed by silver or magical weapons.\nIn giant mole form, they attacked with their claws and bites.\nThe weremole infection was spread on the claws of Urdlen, the Evil One. Any gnome struck by its avatar risked becoming a weremole there no purpose or preference to this, save that only gnomes could be infected.\nUrdlen had weremoles among its burrowing servants. They terrorized and preyed upon all living creatures they caught in these lands, and had been an ever-present enemy of the gnomes who lived in the Nath and Rathgaunt Hills for decades up to the early 1370s DR.\nWeremoles were first reported in the Realms after the avatar of Urdlen assaulted gnome communities in the countryside during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR."
