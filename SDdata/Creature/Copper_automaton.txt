'''Copper automatons''' were magical statues made ​​of [[copper]] and [[bronze]] that move using concealed levers and clockwork gears. This whole mechanism was controlled by magic that made them move or perform their tasks. Usually, copper automatons were made by skilled magicians. Given weapons, they could outperform many warriors.

==Description==
They could be stocky or tall, thickset or skinny. These sculptures were reminiscent of warriors in armor, but could also look like peasants or nobles. Their movements were very fast and accurate, and were almost as articulate as a [[human]].

==Combat==
Copper automatons could cause terrible wounds with their fists, breaking bones and crushing skulls. But, as a rule, most creators of copper automatons gave their creations weapons, and some powerful magicians armed them with magical weapons. Usually, they used different weapons such as [[mace]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[dagger]]s, ''etc''.

Copper automatons could not be cured by magic, potions or the like. Instead, they needed to be repaired and have their magic replenished.

==Habitat/Society==
To create a copper automaton required a great deal of effort and expense, and [[Zakhara]]n magicians could spent months to create such 
creatures.

Copper automatons were not only great warriors, they could also be used as slave labor in smithies, water works, and construction projects. They built and maintained such wonders as palaces in the desert, farms in the jungle, and garden terraces on mountain slopes. Magicians often used copper automatons as guards. When a [[mage]] went on a journey, they could leave a copper automaton to guard their house against thieves and bandits.

==Ecology==
Copper automatons did not require food, sleep, and or any kind of external energy supply.
