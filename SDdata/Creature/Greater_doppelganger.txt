Greater doppelgangers, also called Shallar, elder doppelgangers, or mirrorkin, were more powerful cousins of the common doppelganger. While a normal doppelganger could adopt the appearance of a person, a greater doppelganger could adopt their entire personality.
Like regular doppelgangers, greater doppelgangers appeared as gangly, hairless, gray-skinned humanoids with pale eyes. However, they were faster and more agile than normal doppelgangers, and had tough, protective skin that could continue to  protect them regardless of the form they assumed.
They could adopt the shape and body of any humanoid between  and  tall.
thumb|320px|A greater doppelganger in all its gloryGreater doppelgangers were highly intelligent and sophisticated, and preferred to pursue complex plots that required them to penetrate political and social structures. They were talented liars and deceivers. Unlike ordinary doppelgangers, they had the intelligence and creativity to create novel appearances for themselves without the need to copy someone.
They referred to humans as "stinking ones," claiming that they smelled far worse than doppelgangers.
Greater doppelgangers preferred assassination over combat. They would use their powers of telepathy and mind reading to learn how to set victims at ease or to adopt the form of people they trusted, and then stab them in the back with their sharp claws. They were known to adjust the shape of their claws to make the wounds appear as conventional stab wounds in order to deflect suspicion.
In their natural form, greater doppelgangers attacked with their powerful fists or claws. While wearing the form of a humanoid whose brain they had consumed, the greater doppelganger had access to their combat abilities and skills, but could not replicate the spells or powers of clerics or paladins. They could be briefly shunted into their natural form if they behaved in a way that was strongly opposed to the alignment of the personality they were embodying.
Owing to their innate mastery of shapechanging magic, greater dopplegangers had the ability to twist and rend the power of similar magic in order to injure other creatures under the effects of any kind of polymorph spell.
They were immune to most mind-affecting magic&mdashsuch as those which would hold them in place, put them to sleep, or charm them&mdashand their alignment could not be detected. Even psionicists struggled to penetrate their mental defenses. Only the power of true seeing could reliably reveal them.
They were rarely seen in their natural state. Most often, greater doppelgangers were encountered working alone, having adopted the form of someone important while in the middle of a complex scheme, and most adventurers would remain blissfully unaware that they had even crossed paths with the creature. They would occasionally also be found leading organizations or groups of lesser doppelgangers. They did not work well with others, especially not as a subordinate.
Greater doppelgangers were capable of bearing children. To do so, the greater doppelganger had to assume a female form and to maintain that form for the duration of a pregnancy, otherwise the unborn offspring would die.
