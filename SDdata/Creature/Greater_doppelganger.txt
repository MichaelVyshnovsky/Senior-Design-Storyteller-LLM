'''Greater doppelgangers''', also called '''Shallar''',{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Quelzard, Patron of Adventurers}} '''elder doppelgangers''',{{Cite web enhancement/Dungeon 127 Map and Handout Supplement|7}} or '''mirrorkin,''' were more powerful cousins of the common [[doppelganger]]. While a normal doppelganger could adopt the appearance of a person, a greater doppelganger could adopt their entire personality.

==Description==
Like regular doppelgangers, greater doppelgangers appeared as gangly, hairless, gray-skinned [[humanoid]]s with pale eyes. However, they were faster and more agile than normal doppelgangers, and had tough, protective skin that could continue to  protect them regardless of the form they assumed.

==Abilities==
They could adopt the shape and body of any humanoid between {{SI|4|feet|Long=yes}} and {{SI|8|feet|Long=yes}} tall.

==Personality==
[[File:Doppelganger CoS 2e.jpg|thumb|320px|''A greater doppelganger in all its glory'']]Greater doppelgangers were highly intelligent and sophisticated, and preferred to pursue complex plots that required them to penetrate political and social structures. They were talented liars and deceivers. Unlike ordinary doppelgangers, they had the intelligence and creativity to create novel appearances for themselves without the need to copy someone.

They referred to [[humans]] as "stinking ones," claiming that they smelled far worse than doppelgangers.

==Combat==
Greater doppelgangers preferred assassination over combat. They would use their powers of ''[[telepathy]]'' and ''[[detect thoughts|mind reading]]'' to learn how to set victims at ease or to adopt the form of people they trusted, and then stab them in the back with their sharp claws. They were known to adjust the shape of their claws to make the wounds appear as conventional stab wounds in order to deflect suspicion.

In their natural form, greater doppelgangers attacked with their powerful fists or claws. While wearing the form of a humanoid whose brain they had consumed, the greater doppelganger had access to their combat abilities and skills, but could not replicate the [[spell]]s or powers of [[cleric]]s or [[paladin]]s. They could be briefly shunted into their natural form if they behaved in a way that was strongly opposed to the [[alignment]] of the personality they were embodying.

Owing to their innate mastery of shapechanging [[magic]], greater dopplegangers had the ability to twist and rend the power of similar magic in order to injure other creatures under the effects of any kind of ''[[polymorph]]'' spell.

They were immune to most mind-affecting magic&mdash;such as those which would hold them in place, put them to sleep, or charm them&mdash;and their alignment could not be detected. Even [[psionicist]]s struggled to penetrate their mental defenses. Only the power of ''[[true seeing]]'' could reliably reveal them.

==Society==
They were rarely seen in their natural state. Most often, greater doppelgangers were encountered working alone, having adopted the form of someone important while in the middle of a complex scheme, and most [[adventurer]]s would remain blissfully unaware that they had even crossed paths with the creature. They would occasionally also be found leading organizations or groups of lesser doppelgangers. They did not work well with others, especially not as a subordinate.

Greater doppelgangers were capable of bearing children. To do so, the greater doppelganger had to assume a female form and to maintain that form for the duration of a pregnancy, otherwise the unborn offspring would die.

==History==
[[File:Telakin Dun127 sup p2 Eva Widerman.png|thumb|250px|''Telakin, a greater doppelganger and member of the Unseen.'']]Greater doppelgangers referred to themselves as "Shallar." The term "mirrorkin" was an ancient way of referring to them, but remained in usage in the [[Sword Coast]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

Beginning in the 1340s DR, an organization called the [[Unseen]], led by nine greater doppelgangers, began operating in [[Skullport]] and [[Waterdeep]].  A greater doppelganger was involved in a plot to get close to the [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]], ''circa'' [[1371 DR]].{{DDTS}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, greater doppelgangers played a key part in the schemes of the [[Iron Throne]] to infiltrate and seize control of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Notable Greater Doppelgangers==
* [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]], once, a bride of [[Piergeiron Paladinsonâ€Ž]] and a member of the Unseen ''circa'' [[1371 DR]].
* [[Hlaavin]], a [[half-illithid]] greater doppelganger who led the Unseen in the mid-to-late 13{{th}} century DR.
* [[Ptola]], a member of the Unseen working to infiltrate as many of Skullport's factions as possible in the 1370s DR.
* [[Rhelgyn]], a member of the Unseen who assumed the identify of Lord [[Huld Belabranta]].{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|8}}
* [[Telakin]], one of the nine leaders of the Unseen who was active in trying to control the Waterdhavian [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] and [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] in the 1370s DR.
* [[Quelzard]], an occasional patron of the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]].
