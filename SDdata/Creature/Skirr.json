        "mainbody": "Skirrs were huge, predatory undead that hunted near necropoli or other places where victims might be found hurt and alone.\nSkirrs were massive, skeletal undead \"clothed\" in funerary wrappings that were typically dirty grey. Their form was mostly humanoid, but with a bull-like head the upper arms were deformed into bizarre wings and the lower legs ended in large, curved claws. When they flew, they produced a faint whirring sound, and they were surrounded by \"the stench of death\". On average, skirrs had a wingspan of  and weighed .\nSkirrs were not intelligent, nor particularly orderly or erratic, but their undead nature made them evil creatures.\nSkirrs hunted by swooping down on lone victims, preferably ones already hurt and harried by other dangers. The skirr would pick said victim up, fly to a height of at least , and then drop them. If pressed into combat, skirrs fought by biting or clawing opponents.\nSkirrs lived either alone or in pairs, typically in cold hills, though other reports placed them at necropoli or the edges of deserts or large swamps. They required flesh to survive, and preferred to eat the bodies of those who died from a sudden stop."
