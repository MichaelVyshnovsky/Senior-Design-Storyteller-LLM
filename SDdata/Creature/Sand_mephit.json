        "mainbody": "A sand mephit was a kind of mephit tied to the Elemental Plane of Earth.\nSand mephits had small, winged humanoid forms, colored in earthy browns. They shed a small amount of sand as they moved.\nThese mephits were generally mischievous and mean-spirited, seeking to cause trouble whatever the situation.\nSand mephits fought by clawing at their enemies, and could unleash a breath of searing heat to burn everything in front of them. Although they werent very strong, they were immune to fire and life-destroying effects.\nSand mephits were short-lived creatures linked to the Elemental Plane of Earth, and were closer related to salt and dust mephits than other kinds. They preferred dry, arid environments, and could be found in the Stonelands of Faer√ªn, as well as in the desert of HarAkir in the Domains of Dread. They could also be sent by the powers of the Lower planes as agents against their enemies."
