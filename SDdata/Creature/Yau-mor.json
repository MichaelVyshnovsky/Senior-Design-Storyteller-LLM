        "mainbody": "Yau-mor were lesser spirits found in Kara-Tur.\nYau-mor appeared as freakish monstrosities. They had the torso of a human male and the head and legs of a small dragon. Their heads sported multiple eyes, ranging from a single eye to four. Their skin was a sickly shade of green.\nYau-mor relished combat and destruction, so much so that it often distracted them from their duties. They obeyed orders well enough but were easily manipulated by more intelligent beings.\nYau-mor despised any spellcaster and sought to attack them whenever possible. Due to their low intelligence, a yau-mor was only able to detect a spellcaster once a spell was cast. Once they choose a target, they ignored all other threats until that specific target was eliminated.\nThe yau-mors signature attack was being able to shout a  stream of fire from its mouth. It caused considerable damage and ignited any combustible material. A yau-mor used this ability sparingly as it caused them great pain.\nYau-mor were servants of the Celestial Bureaucracy, performing tasks for the evil-aligned members of the Bureaucracy. When encountered in Kara-Tur, a yau-mor was usually in the midst of a mission for the Celestial Bureaucracy. They were tasked with missions that were either tiresome and dangerous for a more competent being to undertake."
