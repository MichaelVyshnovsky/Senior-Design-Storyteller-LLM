        "mainbody": "A vortex (\nVortexes were small, white featureless orbs, roughly the size of a childs ball. They spun around rapidly as they moved, generating a miniature whirlwind around them that was liable to ensnare any demihuman-sized creature that got caught in its path. Their movements had no discernible patterns, being erratic and rarely moving in simple straight lines.\nThese creatures showed very little sign of intelligence or even consciousness.\nVortexes were solitary beings that mostly kept to themselves within the Elemental Plane of air. They were never witnessed eating in any matter nor reproducing. They were incapable of being summoned, but could appear as manifestations of the elven deities Aerdrie Faenya and Erevan Ilesere.\nSome believed vortexes were spawned by the Elemental Plane of Air itself and subsequently cast out to make a home for themselves. It was also speculated by some that their rapid whirling could be the key to how vortexes sometimes escaped the Elemental Plane of Air."
