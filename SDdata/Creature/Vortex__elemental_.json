        "Description": "Vortexes were small, white featureless orbs, roughly the size of a child's ball. They spun around rapidly as they moved, generating a miniature whirlwind around them that was liable to ensnare any [[demihuman]]-sized creature that got caught in its path. Their movements had no discernible patterns, being erratic and rarely moving in simple straight lines.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures showed very little sign of intelligence or even consciousness.",
        "Ecology": "Vortexes were solitary beings that mostly kept to themselves within the Elemental Plane of air.<ref> They were never witnessed eating in any matter nor reproducing. They were incapable of being [[summon]]ed, but could appear as [[favored monster|manifestations]] of the [[Seldarine|elven deities]] [[Aerdrie Faenya]] and [[Erevan Ilesere]].<ref>",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some believed vortexes were spawned by the Elemental Plane of Air itself and subsequently cast out to make a home for themselves. It was also speculated by some that their rapid whirling could be the key to how vortexes sometimes escaped the Elemental Plane of Air."
