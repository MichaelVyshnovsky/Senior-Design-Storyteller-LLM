Prismatic dragons were legendary beasts of folktales and myths.
These dragons had tiny shimmering scales that glowed with bright light. Their scales were so small it appeared as if the dragons had skin as smooth as a snakes. Prismatic dragons did not have any odor or scent.
Prismatic dragons were outspoken and dramatic creatures. Unlike force dragons, these dragons enjoyed the company of humanoids.
Like most dragons, prismatic dragons preferred quiet places to make their lairs, such as in a ruin or a forest. While these monsters liked to hunt, they were constantly aware not to use all the resources in any given area. While enjoying meat, there were rumors these beasts could gain sustenance from light sources, such as the sun.
They were found in the Dragon Eyrie.
The scale of any prismatic dragon of any age could be used to power a permanency spell cast upon a prismatic sphere.
