        "mainbody": "Dune hags were monstrous humanoids related to the annis hag, who inhabited deserts and wastelands.\nDune hags appeared to be humanoid female crone, tall and decrepit, looming over most any other humanoid creature. They had greenish-brown skin tone, gray hair, and brown decaying teeth. They wore ragged and soiled robes and burnoose cloaks. These creatures stood at  tall and weighed around .\nAvoiding direct confrontations, dune hag lured their victims to remote locations where a covey of hags, ogres, and other evil giants could ambush and murder the prey, trick the victims into killing themselves, or just lure the prey into a sense of security and devour them in their sleep. The most common trick used by the dune hags was changing their appearance to that of a beautiful woman and luring the prey away for a tryst. Dune hags kill eluded the victims mind, bewitching them, and, if discovered, a disguised dune hag would try to kiss at least one victim before retreating. The kissed and enthralled victims were then lured away and consumed at a later time.\nDune hags spoke Common and Giant languages.\nDune hags often used magical disguises, such as the disguise self spell to enthrall their victims.\nWhen forced into a direct battle, dune hags used their clawed hands to rend the opponents and tried to grapple and drag them close for a kiss.\nTo no surprise, dune hags possessed an army or magical abilities. They could cast disguise self, haboob, and skin of the cactus spells thrice per day each and hallucinatory terrain once per day. All of their spells were cast at the proficiency of a seventh circle of magic.\nHumanoid meat was dune hags favorite meal. They went to great lengths, ignoring great risks in pursuit of that delicacy.\nIn the , a group of Hag Survivors that included Mayrina, Adrielle, and Kled, researched ways to save children consumed by hags as the method of procreation. The diary kept by the group collected biology, anatomy, and various diagrams of many types of hags, including annis, dune, and green hags. The book also held research on the hags bane potion that could be used to \"abort\" the hag pregnancy, forcing them to vomit the child they consumed."
