        "mainbody": "'''Dune hags''' were [[monstrous humanoid]]s related to the [[annis hag]], who inhabited deserts and wastelands.",
        "Description": "Dune hags appeared to be [[humanoid]] female crone, tall and decrepit, looming over most any other humanoid creature. They had greenish-brown skin tone, gray hair, and brown decaying teeth. They wore ragged and soiled [[robe]]s and [[burnoose]] [[cloak]]s. These creatures stood at {{SI|8'|'\"|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SI|350|lb|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "Avoiding direct confrontations, dune hag lured their victims to remote locations where a covey of hags, [[ogre]]s, and other evil [[giant]]s could ambush and murder the prey, trick the victims into killing themselves, or just lure the prey into a sense of security and devour them in their sleep. The most common trick used by the dune hags was changing their appearance to that of a beautiful woman and luring the prey away for a tryst. Dune hag's kill eluded the victim's mind, bewitching them, and, if discovered, a disguised dune hag would try to kiss at least one victim before retreating. The kissed and enthralled victims were then lured away and consumed at a later time.\nDune hags spoke [[Common]] and [[Giant language|Giant]] languages.",
        "Abilities": "Dune hags often used magical disguises, such as the ''[[disguise self]]'' [[spell]] to ''[[enthrall]]'' their victims.",
        "Combat": "When forced into a direct battle, dune hags used their clawed hands to rend the opponents and tried to grapple and drag them close for a kiss.\nTo no surprise, dune hags possessed an army or magical abilities. They could cast ''disguise self'', ''[[haboob]]'', and ''[[skin of the cactus]]'' spells thrice per day each and ''[[hallucinatory terrain]]'' once per day. All of their spells were cast at the proficiency of a seventh circle of magic.",
        "Society": "Humanoid meat was dune hags' favorite meal. They went to great lengths, ignoring great risks in pursuit of that delicacy.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of Hag Survivors that included [[Mayrina]], [[Adrielle]], and [[Kled]], researched ways to save children consumed by hags as the method of procreation. The diary kept by the group collected biology, anatomy, and various diagrams of many types of hags, including annis, dune, and [[green hag]]s. The book also held research on the ''[[hag's bane]]'' [[potion]] that could be used to \"abort\" the hag pregnancy, forcing them to vomit the child they consumed."
