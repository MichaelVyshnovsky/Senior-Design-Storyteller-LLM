Loxos (also pluralized as loxoth
In addition to traditional weaponry, Loxos were known to fight with their trunks and trample smaller opponents. They also were known to go into a berserk state if a clan member was seriously harmed.
Loxos typically stayed with their own kind, but would travel to cities for trade. They ignored the conflicts of the region around them unless it threatened their own people. To them, extremes in life were detrimental, whereas balance contributed to the survival of the herd. Although most Loxos on Toril lived in the Shaar, some could also be found around the region of the Golden Water.
Loxo clans, also referred to as herds, typically consisted of a few family units and unattached males. Defending the clan were a number of fithik (lieutenants), the lox-fithik (herd-lieutenant or chief), and the tannuk (wizard).
Loxos spoke their own language, but also spoke Common and Shaaran to negotiate and trade with others nearby.
They often worshiped their own version of the giant deity Hiatea.	
Loxos could be found on Toril as far back as -23040 DR, when small tribes of them lived in the Eastern Shaar and the Shining Lands, nomadically following the massive herds of cloven-hoofed creatures that roamed the land at the time.
According to loxo historians, loxos settled in the Shaar and the Hordelands somewhere around 1118 DR after coming to Toril on spelljammers.
