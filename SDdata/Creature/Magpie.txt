Magpies were a mundane avian species in the Realms.
The song produced by magpies sounded like "queg queg queg..."
Magpies were highly attracted to small, shiny or brightly-colored objects, such as gems or rings. They would often swoop down and steal such objects without ever touching the ground, taking it back to their nest.
These birds were adverse to fighting, even when threatened.
Magpies typically lived in forests, farm lands, and even the urban areas of regions with a temperate climate.
In the Realms, magpies acted as servants of the deity Gwaeron Windstrom. One of the tasks they would carry out for him would be to obscure clues indicating a trail from a followers foes or to reveal such clues to his favored trackers.

In the Kara-Tur city of Balanzia, there was an inn known as the Yellow Magpie.
