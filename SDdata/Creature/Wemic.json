        "Description": "Wemics were larger and stronger than [[human]]s, and could make great leaps with a running start. Both their humanoid hands and feline feet bore claws, with their fore claws being extremely sharp. They had keen eyesight, including [[darkvision]], and exceptional hearing. The humanoid part of wemics had feline characteristics around their eyes, ears and nose with pointed teeth, and their entire bodies were covered in golden fur, save for their white underbellies and black-tipped tails. Males had thick, black, lion-like manes.",
        "Combat": "The tauric wemics were known as excellent hunters, fighters, and tacticians who preferred to strike from ambush. They could fight with both pairs of claws while at the same time wielding [[weapon]]s, which they made from stone and wood. Any metal or magical armament were typically looted from monsters or creatures they had killed.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Wemics were generally carnivorous, but served meat with stewed roots, [[grass]]es and berries. They particularly enjoyed [[boar|wild pig]], lamb and [[porcupine]].",
            "Language": "In addition to speaking their own, rather lion-like language, wemics commonly spoke a thickly accented [[Common Tongue]] and [[Sylvan]].",
            "Reproduction": "Wemics mated whenever was most desireable or convenient. Pregnancies lasted about 10 months and bore litters of one to three cubs, who were born with few survival instincts and camoflauged coats which faded after a few months. Cubs were fully grown by around three years of age.\n\nSome people were known to pay for wemic cubs with the intent of raising them as servants. The price for a cub in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] was about 500 [[gold pieces]].",
            "Homelands": "Wemics could be found in many lands of [[Faerûn]],{{cite book/Races of Faerûn|149}} such as the [[Stonelands]] and [[Goblin Marches]] north of [[Cormyr]], [[Pelleor's Prairie]] in the [[Backlands]], the [[Shining Plains]] of [[Turmish]], and in great numbers in the grasslands of [[the Shaar]]. \n\nBeyond Faerûn, wemics could be found on the [[Malatran Plateau]] of [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|12}}",
            "Culture": "While wemics were often represented as barbaric, illiterate, and uncivilized creatures, they were quite intelligent and made stone weapons and tools, as well as [[clay]] pottery. They were famous for being highly superstitious. Others would describe wemics as nature-oriented people with a rich tradition of oral history.\n\nThey lived close to the land, in tune with its magical forces{{cite book/Races of Faerûn|149}} and in harmony with the nearby populations.{{cite book/Races of Faerûn|150}} While they held few opinions about other races, they were extremely careful not to over-hunt and would become enraged when [[humanoid]]s hunted an animal of [[Toril]] for a small part of its body, such as a horn or other trophy, then leave the carcass for carrion.{{cite book/Races of Faerûn|151}} Ironically, the claws of wemics were prized as decorations by the [[bullywug]]s of Faerûn, and the hair of wemics were used in the creation of ''[[broom of animated attack|brooms of animated attack]]''.",
            "Prides": "Within wemic prides, the females typically outnumbered the males three-to-one, including the younger cubs, who were tended by the females. When they weren't looking over the young, females spent the days scouting or hunting while the males slept. The males of a pride stood guard over their kin at night, protecting them from nocturnal dangers. All wemics were trained from a young age to fight and defend themselves.\n\nYoung wemics would remain with the rest of the pride until they were five years old, at which point they would go on the first hunt. Once they brought back their first kill, they were considered an adult.{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|5}} or wandered off to the nearest humanoid settlement for a new life, so that they would not slow down their kin.\n\n[[image:Wemics Shaar.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''[[Shaar]]an wemics hunt down a [[displacer beast]]'']]The nomadic wemics of the Shaar would form a series of isolated campsites along their seasonal migratory paths. They hunted the nearby pack herds for a given amount of time before rotating to the next camp, allowing other prides and occasionally the local [[loxo]] herds to use the temporary settlements in their absence.{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|2}}",
            "Religion": "Many wemics of the Shaar worshiped the lion-god [[Nobanion]], and their [[shaman]]s led tribal celebrations such as the [[festival of the Pride]]. However a few of the more savage of their kind venerated [[Malar]], the Beastlord."

        "Subspecies": "*[[Mountain wemic]]: This rumored sub-species of the wemic had its lion portions replaced by those of a large cougar. They were slightly smaller than their cousins and generally solitary in nature.",
        "Notable groups": "*[[Golden Mane]], this nomadic pride of wemics roamed the grasslands of the Shaar during the 1300's [[DR]].\n*[[Legion of Lions]], an order of wemic and [[werelion]] [[paladin]]s that fought in service of Nobanion.\n*[[Tenpaw]], the best known tribe of the [[Shining Plains]]."
