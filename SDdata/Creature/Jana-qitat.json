        "Description": "These creatures looked like house cats that sported a pair of wings from their back. The color of their fur varied greatly, though medium brown with a dark face, paws, wings and tail was the rarest coloration.",
        "Combat": "Similar to their larger cousins, these cats only attacked if threatened, flying through the air attempting to rake their targets. Mothers fiercely defended their young.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Relationships": "Fluttercats controlled the vermin population wherever they lived. They were prized as pets and were quite loving toward a master who cared for them. Lucky [[wizard]]s were known to have a fluttercat as a [[familiar]]."
