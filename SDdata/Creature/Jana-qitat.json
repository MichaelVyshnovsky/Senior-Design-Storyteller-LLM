        "mainbody": "The jana-qitat, also called lesser winged cats or fluttercats, were smaller cousins of the jana-nimr. They were usually found within cities.\nThese creatures looked like house cats that sported a pair of wings from their back. The color of their fur varied greatly, though medium brown with a dark face, paws, wings and tail was the rarest coloration.\nSimilar to their larger cousins, these cats only attacked if threatened, flying through the air attempting to rake their targets. Mothers fiercely defended their young.\nAn enclosed lair above ground was the preferred nest of a jana-qitat. They bore litters of 1&ndash3 cubs who lived with the mother for several months before they learned how to fly. Jana-qitat had a lifespan of 20 years.\nFluttercats controlled the vermin population wherever they lived. They were prized as pets and were quite loving toward a master who cared for them. Lucky wizards were known to have a fluttercat as a familiar."
