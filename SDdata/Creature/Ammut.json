        "Combat": "[[File:Ammut.jpg|thumb|''When an adventurer attracts an ammut's attention.'']]\nUsually ammut used their fangs and claws to hurt prey. They would unexpectedly attack from underground and kill their victims very quickly. The keen eyes of an ammut gave it the power to see creatures within the [[Ethereal Plane]]. Ammut hunt individuals with [[evil]] in their souls. In battle, ammuts issued a hideous roar which could be heard for miles.",
