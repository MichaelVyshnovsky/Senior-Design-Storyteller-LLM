'''Wizard lice''' were a species of [[magic|magical]] [[louse]], tiny parasitic insects found in the land of [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
A wizard louse usually measured {{frac|1|16}}{{th}} of an inch in length, making them very difficult to spot.

==Ecology==
Though generally harmless in small numbers, wizard lice bred rapidly, forming a nest on each host they infested. They fed off of memories and magical energy. They were particularly harmful when attached to [[wizards]] or [[cleric|priests]], capable of erasing one [[spell]] per day from their host's memory.

A host infected with wizard lice needed to bathe with strong [[soap]]s or cleaning agents to effectively kill them. The ''[[cure disease]]'' spell was also a reliable method used to destroy wizard lice.
