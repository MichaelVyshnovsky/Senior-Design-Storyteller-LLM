Ghasts were a more powerful subtype of ghouls.
They resembled very closely their undead cousin, except perhaps being just a bit more slender and ghost-like. The stench of death and rot lingered around their undead forms. This stench could often be smelled from a  radius and was terrible enough to cause nausea, retching, and in rare cases even paralysis.
Like most undead, ghasts were immune to mind-affecting spells such as charm and sleep. Though they were known to be especially vulnerable to weapons made of cold iron.
Ghasts were also far more deadly and cunning than ghouls, with their paralytic touch dangerously affecting their opponents, including elves. 
The bite of a ghast could transmit ghoul fever, a disease which killed its victims and then raised them as a new ghoul or ghast.
Much like ghouls, ghasts were typically encountered around graveyards.
Much like ghouls, ghasts spoke whatever language they did in life.
Ghasts often laired with others of their own kind or acted as the leaders of a group of normal ghouls.
When it came to non-undead creatures, ghasts were often enslaved to demons.
*Onglore and Inglore - dwarven nobility who fell in the Weeping War, their bodies were turned into ghasts after their death, leaving them wandering the Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor in a starved frenzy.
