        "mainbody": "jaod was an unintelligent, parasitic creature that could be molded into the shape of a humanoid face or body part. The creature got its name from a sage from Cimbar known as Rinthrin Jaod.  \nThe creatures could be made to adhere to a face and the wearer could shape the jaod into facial features. Air passed freely through the creature so that the wearer could breathe while wearing the jaod. There were no harmful effects to the wearer. They could also be molded into the shape of other body parts, for example, to enhance ones bust size, replace a lost finger or leg, or reshape a torso.\nJaods absorbed alcohol and poisons in the hosts body and gave off a scent that repelled some insects. They could be removed by applying alcohol directly to the jaods body. Forceful removal from the host resulted in minor injury to the host.\nIn the wild, Jaods resembled a hunk of humanoid flesh.\nCategoryCreatures of neutral alignment\nCategoryCreatures\nsw6bried54xf8s5ea2flpm83rgxxiaj"
