Snowcloaks, also known as snow ghosts, were large aberrant creatures that could be found flying across the freezing skies over the Spine of the World.
Snowcloaks had two eel-like heads, each at the end of a long sinous neck, that were dotted with several rows of silver-colored eyes. Each head had a long, pointed jaw filled with needle-sharp teeth. Their bodies were somewhat flat with blunt wings, not unlike the body of a manta ray. Their bodies terminated in a long, lashing, whip-like tail.
The underside of their bodies were gray, while their topsides were as white as snow. These colorations helped them to blend in with their environment.
Snowcloaks kept no lairs, preferring to continuously soar across the skies searching for meals.
Snowcloaks were immune to any harsh or freezing cold and possessed regenerative properties. They also possessed a number of spell-like abilities. They could release a dense fog that blinded others, emit magic projectiles, and disorient others with hypnotizing patterns.
Skilled and patient hunters, snowcloaks preferred to drop down and harry their prey. Their claws inflicting a paralyzing toxin.
Snowcloaks soared the skies alone, or in small groups of three to eight, called drifts.
These creatures were capable of speaking both Auran and Common.
The toxin released by the claws on their wings were highly prized by alchemists for use in creating poisons.
