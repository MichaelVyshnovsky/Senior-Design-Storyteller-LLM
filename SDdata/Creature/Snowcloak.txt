'''Snowcloaks''', also known as '''snow ghosts''', were large [[aberration|aberrant]] creatures that could be found flying across the freezing skies over the [[Spine of the World]].

==Description==
Snowcloaks had two [[eel]]-like heads, each at the end of a long sinous neck, that were dotted with several rows of silver-colored eyes. Each head had a long, pointed jaw filled with needle-sharp teeth. Their bodies were somewhat flat with blunt wings, not unlike the body of a [[manta ray]]. Their bodies terminated in a long, lashing, [[whip]]-like tail.

The underside of their bodies were gray, while their topsides were as white as snow. These colorations helped them to blend in with their environment.

==Behavior==
Snowcloaks kept no lairs, preferring to continuously soar across the skies searching for meals.

==Abilities==
Snowcloaks were immune to any harsh or freezing cold and possessed regenerative properties. They also possessed a number of [[spell]]-like abilities. They could release a ''[[obscuring mist|dense fog that blinded others]]'', emit ''[[magic missile|magic projectiles]]'', and ''[[hypnotic pattern|disorient others with hypnotizing patterns]]''.

==Combat==
Skilled and patient hunters, snowcloaks preferred to drop down and harry their prey. Their claws inflicting a paralyzing toxin.

==Ecology==
Snowcloaks soared the skies alone, or in small groups of three to eight, called ''drifts''.
===Languages===
These creatures were capable of speaking both [[Auran]] and [[Common]].
===Usage===
The toxin released by the claws on their wings were highly prized by [[alchemist]]s for use in creating [[poison]]s.
