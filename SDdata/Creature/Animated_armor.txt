An animated armor, or just a suit of armor for brevity,
Animated armor could remain motionless for unlimited period of time, being virtually indistinguishable from ordinary sets of armor on display. They were capable of speaking in hollow whispers, reciting warning or stating their purpose, yet unable to negotiate with intruders.
As constructs, animated suits of armor were unaffected by all spells that affected ones mind, such as charm, sleep, etc, as well as necrotic magic and energies left them unscathed. They also immune to all poisons, and could not be blinded, deafend, frightened, paralyzed, or petrified. They could never get tired.
Possessing only the simplest spark of intelligence, the armors could not use any complex strategies, instead, they directly attacked with brute strength, using their weapons, or unarmed slams.
Functioning through magic that animated them, these armors could not function within dead-magic zone or antimagic fields. There was a chance that if faced with the dispel magic spell, they were turned into mundane, non-animated armor sets.
In the late 14 century DR, numerous animated armors were task with defending Lyrans Hold, the stronghold of the undead villain Lyran in the Forest of Wyrms.
In the late 15 century DT, ancient decaying animated sets of armor were guarding the Jade Temple of Dagon in the Moonsea North. Animated armors were also used at the infamous Hillsfar Arena as one of many challenges for the gladiators to overcome. Another use for the armors in the late 15 century DR was stationing them, alongside flying swords and guardian portraits within nobles tombs of Waterdeeps City of the Dead. 
During Elturels Descent into Avernus of the , several suits of animated armor escaped from the High House of Wonders in Baldurs Gate, briefly becoming a threat in the Upper City. During the Absolute crisis of the same year, animated armors were discovered within the ancient Grymforge in the Underdark, still defending it from the cultists and adventurers.
