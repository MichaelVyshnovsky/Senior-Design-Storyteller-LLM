An '''animated armor''', or just a '''suit of armor''' for brevity,

==Behavior==
Animated armor could remain motionless for unlimited period of time, being virtually indistinguishable from ordinary sets of armor on display. They were capable of speaking in hollow whispers, reciting warning or stating their purpose, yet unable to negotiate with intruders.

==Abilities==
As constructs, animated suits of armor were unaffected by all spells that affected one's mind, such as ''[[charm]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', etc, as well as [[necrotic energy|necrotic]] magic and energies left them unscathed. They also immune to all [[poison]]s, and could not be ''[[blind]]ed'', ''[[deaf]]end'', frightened, ''[[paralyze]]d'', or ''[[petrified]]''. They could never get tired.

==Combat==
Possessing only the simplest spark of intelligence, the armors could not use any complex strategies, instead, they directly attacked with brute strength, using their weapons, or unarmed slams.

==Ecology==
Functioning through magic that animated them, these armors could not function within [[dead-magic zone]] or ''[[antimagic field]]s''. There was a chance that if faced with the ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell, they were turned into mundane, non-animated armor sets.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], numerous animated armors were task with defending [[Lyran's Hold]], the stronghold of the [[undead]] villain [[Lyran]] in the [[Forest of Wyrms]].

In the late 15{{th}} century DT, ancient decaying animated sets of armor were guarding the [[Jade Temple]] of [[Dagon]] in the [[Moonsea North]].{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|17}} Animated armors were also used at the infamous [[Hillsfar Arena]] as one of many challenges for the [[gladiator]]s to overcome.{{Cite adventurers league/Blood Above, Blood Below|16}} Another use for the armors in the late 15{{th}} century DR was stationing them, alongside ''[[flying sword]]s'' and ''[[guardian portrait]]s'' within nobles' tombs of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[City of the Dead]].{{Cite adventurers league/Beneath the City of the Dead|7}} 

During [[Elturel]]'s [[Descent into Avernus]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, several suits of animated armor escaped from the [[High House of Wonders]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], briefly becoming a threat in the [[Upper City]]. During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the same year, animated armors were discovered within the ancient [[Grymforge]] in the [[Underdark]], still defending it from the cultists and adventurers.

==Notable Armors==
* [[Hollow armor]], a variant of animated armor created through [[shadow]] possession.
* [[Klank]], one of the bouncers for the [[Elfsong Tavern]], later returned to its creator â€“ [[Lorroakan]].
* [[Strahd's animated armor]], a more powerful variety found exclusively under the control of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] of [[Ravenloft]].
