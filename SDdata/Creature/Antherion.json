        "mainbody": "An antherion was an animalistic shapechanger that could transform from an animal into a humanoid, or an animal-humanoid hybrid.\nAntherions were essentially the opposites of lycanthropes, which they were very often confused with. Antherion parents passed on their condition to their offspring, and could not pass it on by attacking foes. Their names often took the animal name as the prefix and were as the suffix.\nAntherions despised lycanthropes, just as lycanthropes despised antherions, and would attack them on sight.\nAntherions often fought in their hybrid form, where they could make the best use of both humanoid and animal traits. Unlike lycanthropes, such creatures could only be hit by cold iron, instead of silver. Both, however, were affected by magical weapons.\n* Wolfwere\n* Jackalwere\n* Coyotlwere"
