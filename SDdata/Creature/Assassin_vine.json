        "mainbody": "An '''assassin vine''' was a type of carnivorous [[Plant creature|plant]] found in varieties both above and below the surface.",
        "Description": "A single specimen usually consisted of a {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} main branch as thick as a [[human]]'s forearm. Smaller vines up to {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} extended from the main branch and bore clusters of [[grape]]-like berries. The bark was stringy. The leaves of an assassin vine were distinct in their asymmetric five-pointed shapes, which resembled a hand.\n\nThe plants were tougher than usual and were resistant to burning or freezing. Electricity did not harm them at all.\n\nAssassin vines could move along the ground but very slowly.",
        "Variants": "A related plant was also found in the [[Underdark]]. These varieties had thinner stems and gray leaves with brown, silver, or white veins. Since they could not make energy from the sun, they required a source of thermal energy and would usually generate enough offal to also support colonies of subterranean fungi in a symbiotic relationship.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "The [[Ardeep Forest]] east of [[Waterdeep]] contained a population of assassin vines.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|4}} They were also present in large numbers in the [[Flooded Forest]] between [[the Vast]] and the [[Moonsea]]. And they potentially grew in the [[Vast Swamp]]. \n\nIn the [[Shining South]] they could be found in the [[Forest of Amtar]], [[Halruaa]], [[Luiren]], the [[Lluirwood]], the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]], and the [[Toadsquat Mountains]]. They occasionally grew in [[Chondalwood]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], assassin vines could be found in [[Plane of Shadow]] in the Vast Swamp's counterpart, the [[Shadow Swamp]].\n\n[[Myconid]]s in the [[Lowerdark]] city of [[Fluvenilstra]] kept a defense of subterranean assassin vines, in addition to other plant creatures.",
            "Usages": "The fruit of an assassin vine was tough and bitter, but it could be turned into [[assassin vine wine|a strong wine]]."
