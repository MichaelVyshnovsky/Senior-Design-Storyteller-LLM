        "mainbody": "'''Ghasts''' were a more powerful subtype of [[ghouls]].",
        "Description": "They resembled very closely their [[undead]] cousin, except perhaps being just a bit more slender and ghost-like. The stench of death and rot lingered around their undead forms. This stench could often be smelled from a {{SI|10|ft}} radius and was terrible enough to cause nausea, retching, and in rare cases even paralysis.",
        "Abilities": "Like most undead, ghasts were immune to mind-affecting [[spell]]s such as ''[[charm]]'' and ''[[sleep]]''. Though they were known to be especially vulnerable to weapons made of [[cold iron]].",
        "Combat": "Ghasts were also far more deadly and cunning than ghouls, with their paralytic touch dangerously affecting their opponents, including [[elves]]. \n\nThe bite of a ghast could transmit [[ghoul fever]], a [[disease]] which killed its victims and then raised them as a new ghoul or ghast.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Much like ghouls, ghasts were typically encountered around graveyards.",
            "Languages": "Much like ghouls, ghasts spoke whatever language they did in life.",
            "Relationships": "Ghasts often laired with others of their own kind or acted as the leaders of a group of normal ghouls.\n\nWhen it came to non-undead creatures, ghasts were often enslaved to [[demon]]s."
        },
        "Notable Ghasts": "*[[Onglore]] and [[Inglore]] - dwarven nobility who fell in the [[Weeping War]], their bodies were turned into ghasts after their death, leaving them wandering the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] of [[Myth Drannor]] in a starved frenzy."
