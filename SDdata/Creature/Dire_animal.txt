A dire animal was a larger and more powerful version of an ordinary animal.
Dire animals were tougher, bigger and monstrous versions of ordinary animals. They also appeared to be more feral and violent than other animals. Their appearance was somewhat prehistoric and demonic.
Such animals were more resistant to certain magical spells, such as enrage animals. Some spells also allowed dire animals to be summoned to the aid of the caster.
The animal forms of many lycanthropes were of the dire version, such as werebadgers, wererats, and even weremoles.Though Demihuman Deities does not use the "dire" appellation for the weremole, only calling it a "giant mole", Shining South and Serpent Kingdoms call the members of the Blood Screamers "dire weremoles", suggesting that the giant mole is a dire mole. Neither giant moles nor dire moles have been presented outside the weremole, however.
