        "mainbody": "'''Disenchanters''' were [[dromedary]]-like creatures that fed on the dweomer of [[magic item]]s.",
        "Description": "Disenchanters looked roughly like spindly, pale electric blue dromedaries. Their small heads possessed a flexible, [[elephant]]-like trunk which could reach out {{SI|5|ft}}. The creatures were somewhat translucent, and would occasionally shimmer.In the 3rd edition ''[[Fiend Folio 3rd edition|Fiend Folio]]'', while retaining many of their traits from prior writeups, disenchanters are presented differently in key ways that can't be reconciled with their <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">[[Forgotten Realms]]</span>-specific description in ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'', which is in line with that of the 1st edition ''[[Fiend Folio 1st edition|Fiend Folio]]''. This article therefore ignores the physical description from this source per the [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Canon#Hierarchy|Canon Hierarchy]], despite the fact that it is more recent.",
        "Abilities": "The disenchanter's namesake ability allowed them to leech the ''dweomer'' of any magic item touched by its snout, rendering the tapped object fully intact but magically inert. This ability could also be used to absorb tangible spell effects.\n\nIn order to support their diet, disenchanters could ''[[detect magic]]'' around them in a {{SI|120|ft}} radius.",
        "Behavior": "Typically docile creatures, disenchanters tended to become aggressive only towards those carrying magical items. Despite the fact that they were more difficult to drain, the creatures had a preference for objects with stronger enchantments, although they avoided extremely potent items, such as [[artifact]]s.\n\nDisenchanters could speak, but typically only in their own language. A scant few were known to speak [[Common]] or [[Elven language|Elven]].",
        "Combat": "Disenchanters could only be struck by magical weapons, which did not lose their capabilities from coming into contact with any part of the body besides the snout.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Disenchanters usually lived in the lands east of [[Anauroch]], with most of the creatures taking up residence around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]."
        },
        "Uses": "A disenchanter's cranial fluids were used in the concoction of a disorienting and corrosive [[poison]] known as [[calad]].\n\n{{SI|12|oz}} of disenchanter hair was typically used in the creation of a bottle of ''[[oil of disenchantment]]''.{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|40}}\n\nA technique to improve one's chances with a ''[[great elixir]]'' was to drink any other beneficial [[elixir]] immediately followed up by an entire goblet of disenchanter blood. Doing so got rid of the positive effects of the \"lesser\" elixir, but in return almost eliminated the danger of death from drinking the ''great elixir''.\n\nThe essence of a disenchanter was reportedly effective when used in [[ink]] for writing scrolls. It was also possibly used in creating ''[[rod of cancellation|rods of cancellation]]''.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, disenchanter brains were among the items considered to be a possible ''[[universal material component]]''.",
        "History": "Some sages speculated that disenchanters were originally created by the [[phaerimm]] as a weapon against [[Netheril]] or the [[sharn]].\n\nEvery 150 years or so, disenchanters converged upon the historic site of [[Sarbreen]], which since the 13{{th}} century housed the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]. The last of these [[Plague of Disenchanters|Plagues of Disenchanters]] before the settlement of the Living City, around the {{YearlinkName|1220}}, was witnessed by the [[evoker]] [[Tym]], whose writings about the creatures in ''[[A Miscellany of Magical Monsters]]'' led to more widespread knowledge about disenchanters.\n\nSometime in the 1360s DR, the [[Emerald Enclave]] member [[Selsian Earthenhands]] started off his ill-fated project to construct a garden near the [[Elven Court]] in [[Cormanthor]], commissioned by his organization to welcome migrating [[Evermeet]]ian [[elf|elves]] in return for favors from Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]], by releasing a pack of disenchanters to clear out undesired ambient magic from the site.{{Cite web/Emerald Enclave Portals: Cormanthor}}\n\nThe first Plague of Disenchanters experienced by Ravens Bluff circa the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, drew mixed reactions. The [[Church of Chauntea|Chauntean]] [[House of Bountiful Harvest]] saw the creatures as a blessing from their goddess, and decreed no harm should come to them. Conversely, the [[Wizards Guild]] put up a bounty of 100 [[gp]] per disenchanter tail, which caused a rapid decrease in the creatures' numbers in the area. The Guild retracted this bounty not too long after they deemed the danger was quelled.",
        "Notable Disenchanters": "In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, the [[Tsurlagol]]i slaver [[Temmi Dharimm]] employed a number of trained monsters, including a pair of disenchanters."
