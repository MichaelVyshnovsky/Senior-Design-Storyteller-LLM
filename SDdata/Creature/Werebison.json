        "mainbody": "A werebison was a lycanthrope that could turn into a bison-like humanoid.\nThese werebeasts were large and herbivorous, unlike most other lycanthropes. In their human form, they were of average size, but they could transform into their \nalternative form that looked much like a minotaur, but with a bisons head.\nThey were powerfully built, with a bony skull. Werebisons were very hairy and stocky. Despite their raw power and robustness, they were of low intelligence, but quick for their shear size.\nWerebisons rarely bit opponents (as they were herbivorous), so only inflicted the curse of lycanthropy when they felt necessary. They didnt collect treasure, and were often found near the creatures they could shapechange into, which they also protected.\nIn combat, werebisons charged into their opponents, and stomped with their large feet. Being amongst the largest of werebeasts, they were far more resistant and inflicted more damage.\nSome tribal peoples living close to werebisons believed them to be holy, and chose not to hunt them. These weretypes formed the largest groups amongst lycanthropes, with up to twelve in a pack, and never roamed on their own or in a pair."
