        "mainbody": "'''Foo lions''' were a variety of [[foo creature]]. They were seen as symbols of strength and courage in [[Kara-Tur]] and by good beings across the [[Cosmology|planes]].",
        "Description": "Like all foo creatures, foo lions were four-legged beasts with large, flat heads and big eyes, with leonine bodies about seven feet long. Foo lions had a shaggy mane about their necks. Their tails were longer and their mouths larger than those of [[foo dog]]s. Their thick fur was usually gold, black, or orange.\n\nFoo lions sometimes decorated their manes with [[wikipedia:Peony|peonies]].",
        "Abilities": "Foo lions had all the supernatural abilities of other foo creatures. When they roared consistently for over a minute, the sound would occasionally summon one or two additional foo lions to their aid.\n\nFoo lions were exceptionally intelligent.",
        "Personality": "Foo lions had similar personalities to other foos, but they were especially known for their patience.\n\nFoo lions and foo dogs did not usually associate with each other, though they had no animosity towards each other.",
        "Combat": "Foo lions attacked with tooth and claw, which caused more harm to evil creatures than non-evil ones. Foo lions who were outmatched were likely to retreat to regroup. They favored sneak attacks and siege tactics more than foo dogs tended to.",
        "Society": "In their extraplanar homes, foo lions lived either alone or in groups known as prides. They spoke their own language and the language of foo dogs. They could also speak the languages of those [[humanoid]]s with whom they frequently interacted.",
        "Ecology": "Foo lions ate all manner of inorganic material, including gems and precious metals, especially enjoying [[silver]] and [[platinum]].",
        "History": "Traditionally, statues of foo lions guarded the homes of many official buildings in Kara-Tur. Some of these statues were enchanted by [[wu jen]] as a means of communicating with lions in their home planes and requesting aid. The lions did not always answer, however.\n\nKara-Turran nobles and military officials often embroidered emblems of foo lions into their robes. The same was done by military officials in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and [[Mount Celestia]].\n\nFoo lions were once servants of the goddess [[Tyche]]."
