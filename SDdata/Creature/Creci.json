        "mainbody": "'''Creci''', more commonly known as the legendary '''great white saru''', were a species of reclusive and intelligent white apes that shared ancestry with the monstrous [[kretch]] warriors of the extra-planar evil known as [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Village|7}}",
        "Description": "An adult male Creci reached the height of {{SI|8'|'\"|long=yes}} at the shoulder. They resembled a massive and powerful ape in appearance, similar to a [[saru]] race found on the [[Malatran Plateau]], but much bigger. Another difference between Creci and saru were their skulls. Creci showed a bigger skull dome that housed a bigger and more intelligent brain. Despite the first appearance, great white sarus were not afflicted with [[albinism]]. Their skin was white, and their body was covered in white hair. However, their eyes were not red, but brown.",
        "Abilities": "Spells such as ''[[polymorph]]'' did not affect Creci.",
        "Personality": "Creci were ingressive and methodical-thinking species; however, they were also strong and intimidating.",
        "Combat": "When forced into combat, Creci were powerful and cunning opponents. They strategized and devised optimal plans to tackle each situation. They utilized immense strength, punches, claws, and bites, but before it came to that, Creci wielded [[longspear]]s.",
        "Society": {
            "Culture": "Creci could create technology complicated by the Malatran standards, setting them apart from the less intelligent and industrious saru of the tribes. Creci carried complex fire-starters of their own making. One of the item's uses was performing the traditional funeral right. The dead were placed atop a large funeral pyre and incinerated. This was considered to be \"sending the dead son to the sky.\" The funeral was accompanied by the singing of a dirge. The song talked of the freedom the dead found in the skies and in the tall trees of the jungle.\n\nSome Creci knew [[the Art]] and [[Sorcerer|sorcerous]] ways. One of the [[enchanted]] items created by them contained magics similar to the ''[[lesser geas]]'' spell.{{Cite living jungle/The Jungle Book of Malatra|52}}",
            "Legends": "The great white sarus carried a legend among their people that talked about [[the Return]] – the even that hailed the return of [[Vizurathu]], the Lion Spirit of the jungles. The legend prophesied that the spirit would be weakened and needed the spirit of [[Amaranthus]] to join the Lion's essence in order to fight the dreaded Tiger – the Tamara."

        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "The only known reclusive community of great white saru lived in the jungles around the Lake of Time, or [[Lake Kovo]] for non-Creci."
        },
        "History": "In the Year of Great Change of Malatran Calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle encountered one of the legendary great white sarus – [[Haniyya]], inhabiting deep forests around the Lake of Time. A year prior, Haniyya's wife was killed by [[giant spider]]s, and the Year of Great Change brought forth a violent death to his only son – [[Hanan]]. The young Creci encountered a group of evil kretch who tore the youth apart. The grieving father briefly suspected the strange group of [[humanoid]]s but, with the help of shatha leaves, was able to communicate with the heroes of Malatra. Together, they performed the traditional funeral ceremony of the great white saru and soon after tracked down and slew the evil servants of the Tamara.\n\nWhen the vengeance was served, Haniyya shared some of the histories of his species with the heroes and guided them to the Lake of Time. Hitting the waters of the lake with his palms, the great Creci summoned the lake's guardian spirit, a noble [[water elemental]] that transported the group to the [[Dreamlands]], to commune with Amaranthus, one of the spirits of the Living Jungle.",
        "Notable Creci": "*[[Haniyya]], the name translated as \"the happy one\", or \"Smiley\", from the Creci language. Both he and his son [[Hanan]] lived on the Malatran Plateau in the late 14{{th}} century DR."
