'''Muskoxen''' ({{Variant|musk ox}} {{Variant|musk-ox|alt=yes}}) were a species of bovine and a type of herd animal.

==Description==
Their bodies were very similar to that of an [[ox]] and they had short, curved horns.Despite their name, muskox are actually more related to [[goat]]s and [[sheep]] than they are oxen.

==Behavior==
Being herd animals, musk-oxen were generally non-aggressive. They would sometimes stampede away from those they considered threats to their safety.

==Combat==
Musk-oxen typically fought other creatures with their hooves and horns.{{Cite dragon/137/Into the Age of Mammals|47}}

==History==
The existence of musk-oxen on [[Toril]] dated back to the days of [[Netheril]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
These creatures were typically found in the forests and tundras of cold climate regions.{{Cite dragon/137/What's For Lunch?|14}} They were known to inhabit the [[Great Glacier]], particularly in the [[Ibelgrak Valley]] and [[Novularond]], as well as the [[World Pillar Mountains]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

===Usage===
Other creatures were known to use their hides to construct blankets and [[robe]]s. Their hides generally fetched 5 [[gp]], while blankets made from them could go for up to 50 gp.{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|17}}

In the Great Glacier, the [[Iulutiun]]s were known to both hunt and raise musk-oxen for their meat as well as their thick, creamy [[milk]]. Outside their largest settlement, [[Lilinuk]], there were large herds of musk-oxen enclosed in pens with ice-block walls. [[Frost folk]] were also known to herd musk-oxen.

Some arctic [[ranger]]s were known to have musk-oxen as [[animal companion]]s.
