Muskoxen ( ) were a species of bovine and a type of herd animal.
Their bodies were very similar to that of an ox and they had short, curved horns.Despite their name, muskox are actually more related to goats and sheep than they are oxen.
Being herd animals, musk-oxen were generally non-aggressive. They would sometimes stampede away from those they considered threats to their safety.
Musk-oxen typically fought other creatures with their hooves and horns.
The existence of musk-oxen on Toril dated back to the days of Netheril.
These creatures were typically found in the forests and tundras of cold climate regions. They were known to inhabit the Great Glacier, particularly in the Ibelgrak Valley and Novularond, as well as the World Pillar Mountains.
Other creatures were known to use their hides to construct blankets and robes. Their hides generally fetched 5 gp, while blankets made from them could go for up to 50 gp.
In the Great Glacier, the Iulutiuns were known to both hunt and raise musk-oxen for their meat as well as their thick, creamy milk. Outside their largest settlement, Lilinuk, there were large herds of musk-oxen enclosed in pens with ice-block walls. Frost folk were also known to herd musk-oxen.
Some arctic rangers were known to have musk-oxen as animal companions.
