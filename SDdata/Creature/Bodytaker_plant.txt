A '''bodytaker plant''' was a malicious [[plant creature]] that sought to dominate its surroundings by replacing all nearby life forms with its own podlings.

==Description==
The rough shape of a bodytaker plant was that of a large, central pod surrounded by a multitude of vines.

Completely destroying a bodytaker plant was a difficult task, as it could regrow from a single stray fiber within a matter of months. Usually, poisoning or salting the soil was necessary to prevent a bodytaker from reappearing.

As fairly intelligent beings, bodytaker plants could communicate in [[Deep Speech]] as well as through [[telepathy]].

==Abilities==
By depositing a creature into its central pod, a bodytaker plant could render it comatose and dissolve it within a few hours, creating a nigh-perfect replica known as a '''podling''' in its stead. These copies retained the memories of the original creature but were under the complete control of the bodytaker. Podlings were used to infiltrate and overthrow nearby power structures, and supplied the bodytaker plant with new victims that would also be turned into podlings. Often, podlings exhibited certain strange behaviors that indicated to others familiar with the original creature that something was amiss. A podling required no sleep and would dissolve into goo when it or its bodytaker plant master was killed.

==Personality==
Bodytaker plants were confident in their own status as superior organisms, viewing areas under their dominion as healthier and more efficient. As such, they sought to gain complete control of any area in which they sprouted, even on a societal scale. Anyone who objected to the superiority of bodytaker plants had no value beyond serving as fertilizer.

==Combat==
In combat, a bodytaker plant would use its vines to either pummel an opponent or grab them to deposit them within its digestion pod.

==History==
Scholars felt certain bodytaker plants originated either from the stars or from the dark depths of some world or other. Regardless of their origin, bodytaker plants were known to exist on the [[Demiplane of Dread]],{{Cite adventurers league/The Deadliest Game|15}} and [[I'Cath]].{{Cite adventurers league/The City of Dreams|12}}

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[dragonborn]] sage [[Thava Norixus]] managed to get himself trapped inside a bodytaker plant within the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]].{{Cite adventurers league/When the Lights Went Out in Candlekeep|28}}
