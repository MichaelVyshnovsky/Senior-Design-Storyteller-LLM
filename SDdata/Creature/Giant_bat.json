        "Description": "Dire bats averaged {{SI|200|pounds|k|long=yes}} and had leathery wings that stretched {{SI|15|feet|long=yes}} from end to end. Their bodies were covered in shaggy fur.",
        "Behavior": "Dire bats hunted at night and rested during the day. They were stealthy and used echolocation to locate prey.\n\nThese bats were easy to startle and tended to kill or drive away any other encountered creatures with their bite.",
        "History": "In the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]], giant bats were commonly known for being the steeds of the [[Lance Defenders]], the army of the [[dragonborn]] nation of [[Tymanther]].\n\nAround [[1374 DR]], one could find them stabled by the [[Zhentarim]] as mounts within the [[Temple in the Sky]].<ref>",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Dire bats flourished in the deepest regions of the [[Underdark]] and [[Undermountain]].\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], giant bats could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]. With some claiming that they and other bat species were more numerous there than in any other [[plane]] of existence.",
            "Relationships": "Dire bats were a [[favored animal]] of the [[orc]] god [[Shargaas]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|14}}\n\nThey were used as mounts by members of the [[Shadovar]] military and [[Zhentarim skymage]]s. [[Shield dwarf|Shield dwarves]] of [[Oghrann]] in the [[Upperdark]] also kept large populations of dire bats to use as mounts as well.\n[[File:Morgan Longbow giant bat.jpg|thumb|''[[Morgan Longbow]] being attacked by dire bats.'']]\nThe [[drow]] kept dire bats both as objects of gambling and steeds. As the former, dire bats were used like chickens or dogs to fight each other, and the drow bet on the outcome. These fights happened either in the air or on the ground, in the latter case, the animals were specifically crippled. The latter use as steeds was dangerous for the rider and was done only in some drow cities. In that case commoners, which might well include children, were used, so that the damage to a community was negligible, if the rider died.{{Cite web/Drow Pets and Animal Companions}}"
