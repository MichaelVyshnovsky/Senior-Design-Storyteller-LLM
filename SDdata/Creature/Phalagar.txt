'''Phalagars''' were rare, [[magical beast|magical]] burrowing predators that emerged in the [[Underdark]] following the [[Spellplague]]. They had a widespread reputation for the violent attacks they perpetrated.

==Description==
These monstrous creatures had [[squid]]-like bodies,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silver Lining|1}} capable of crawling through cracks and narrow tunnels. They had many long tentacles that were covered with small, [[acid]] dripping mouths.

==Combat==
Phalagar typically tried to slay a single prey and then drag it away to prey upon the corpse, though sometimes they would fight a group of combatants to the death. Their tentacles were capable of rending flesh from bone and used the acid they dripped to melt prey as they grasped them.

==Ecology==
These beasts lived solitary lives, lurking within large cracks, channels or wells that have dried up, or beneath the ground.
===Relationships===
Other creatures sometimes lurked near the hunting grounds of phalagars, seeking to steal away their prey or pick off wounded survivors. [[Choker]]s were one of the creatures most likely to do this.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]],<ref group="note">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki. a mining operation conducted by the [[Festering Wound tribe]] within the [[Tannath Mountains]] attracted the attention of a pair of phalagars.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silver Lining|18}} fought the pair. Instead of killing them, he chose to bound the pair to the area by means of a glowing symbol on the ground. Forcing them to guard the [[orc]] tribe and protect the area from further intruders until they finished mining out the area's [[menhir]] stones. Eventually, a group of [[adventurer]]s came and fought off both the orcs and phalagars on behalf of the [[Cloudrippers]] tribe of [[goblin]]s.
