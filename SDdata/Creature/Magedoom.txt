'''Magedooms''' were horrors created by [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]]s to eradicate non-Zhentarim wizards.

==Description==
The distinct smell of ozone permeated the air around a magedoom. The scent was said to resemble a fresh lightning strike combined with potent citrus fruit. A magedoom appeared to be a conical mound of beige muck shining with moisture. The mound was crowned with a desiccated eyeless [[human]] head. A pair of stout appendages hung where "arms" might be expected to be found. These appendages terminated with large, bloodshot eyes.

==Personality==
Magedooms were always found alone. In fact, it was rumored that if two magedooms came within {{SI|10|ft}} of each other, an explosion would result creating a [[dead-magic zone]] with a {{SI|40|ft}} radius that lasted for a month.

==Combat==
[[File:Magedoom 2e.png|thumb|''A magedoom and its victim.'']]
A magedoom would always attack a spellcaster first if confronted with multiple enemies. Their heavy appendages caused significant harm when striking a target.

When a wizard cast a spell within {{SI|180|ft}} of a magedoom it was able to target the source of the spell and track them. When the target wizard was within striking distance the magedoom would lash out with a slimy tentacle and touch the wizard on the forehead. This attack was similar to an ''[[energy drain]]'' but it only drained the wizard's ability to cast powerful spells. The spells beyond the wizard's ability fled their mind, requiring them to relearn the spell. This effect faded over a few hours.

Since magedooms were blind, and tracked their target by sensing magic, any spells or attacks against sight had no effect upon them.

These creatures radiated an ''[[anti-magic shell]]'' in a {{SI|3|ft}} radius around them. This ''anti-magic shell'' effectively negated any magical enchantment for equipment within this area.

If slain during combat a magedoom would explode in a destructive ''[[wild surge]]'' that affected anything within {{SI|15|ft}}. This ''wild surge'' lasted for five minutes after the magedoom's death.

==Society==
A magedoom's sole purpose for existing was the destruction of non-Zhentish spellcasters. [[Mystra]], [[Azuth]] and their priesthoods loathed these vile creations. The destruction of a magedoom was often a required task given by a high priest in the form of a ''[[geas]]'' for followers of Mystra or Azuth who acted against their gods and wished to return to their favor. Azuth was rumored to grant experienced followers a unique [[spell]] designed to destroy magedooms.

==History==
A living wizard was used to create a magedoom. The wizard's body and spirit were transformed using a forbidden spell. The resulting magedoom was partially controlled by the [[archmage]] who created it, providing the magedoom with a task and allowing the magedoom a wide variety of freedom to complete the task however it wished.
