        "mainbody": "'''Dakons''' were an uncommon species of ape, with a level of intelligence comparable to most [[humanoid]]s.",
        "Description": "These creatures largely resembled [[gorilla]]s, but had light brown fur and black hands with sharp claws. Their eyes were of a green hue.\n\nMales were known to wear [[anklet]]s, arm bands, [[bracer]]s, and head pieces. Females preferred to wear earrings, necklaces, and noserings.",
        "Personality": "Dakon were very proud and protective of their culture. They had a strong love for [[gold]] and would spare no expense to adorn themselves in jewelry made from the metal.",
        "Abilities": "Like many primates, the dakon were skilled climbers. Capable of climbing trees and rough surfaces in even the most tense, combative situations. They uniquely possessed an innate ability similar to the [[spell]] ''[[animal friendship]]'', which any nonhuman primate was subject to.",
        "Combat": "Dakons generally never attack unless it was in self-defense. And they only used their sharp claws when unarmed. Typical weapons used by them when either hunting or engaging in warfare included [[blowgun]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[javelin]]s, [[spear]]s, and a type of [[club]] known as a [[kerrie|knobkerrie]]. Their weapons were made of either bone, [[ivory]], stone, or wood. Their knobkerrie were sometimes elaborately carved and shaped. And while [[warrior]]s could be seen carrying all types of weapons, their [[priest]]s only wielded blowguns and knobkerries.\n\nThey refrained from using armor besides [[helmet]]s, considering it cowardly. They commonly wielded wooden shields covered with colorfully painted leather and helmets made from the skulls of their enemies. They sometimes rode [[elephant]]s into battle, with a trained rider wielding a club and a warrior wielding one or more ranged weaponry.",
        "Society": {
            "Societal Roles": {
                "Local leaders": "Each dakon community was led by a male with the title of ''ghana,'' meaning \"war chief,\" the highest rank of warrior. Ghanas ran their community's mines, got first pick of any communal property, led its mature males in its defense, carried out the policies of their regional leader, and acted as both judge and jury. Every five years a male-only competition would be held for the title of ghana &mdash; sometimes sooner if a ghana was ousted due to death, cowardice, or failure to carry out their duties. These competitions involved a ritual show of ferocity and toughness by means of visual display &mdash; teeth baring, pounding of chests, war cries, and inordinate amounts of arm-flailing were always present. Whenever a competition ended in a tie communities would split up, with the younger ghana leading his followers to settle a new one.",
                "Regional leaders": "The collection of communities in a region were led by a male with the title of ''kaya maghan'', meaning \"king of gold,\" so named because they had ownership of all gold mines in their region. They kept whatever amount they wished, then would distribute the rest as gifts to their most loyal retainers, ghanas, and warriors. Failure to obey them was considered a criminal offense. The most powerful ghanas would compete to fill this position whenever it became vacant. Sometimes when such a competition resulted in a tie, there would be a brief period of civil war.",
                "Religious leaders": "In addition to those aforementioned leadership roles, each community typically had a [[shaman]] known as a ''sakir'', who received powers from their ancestral spirits that they used to perform community service. They also would act as both judge and jury of criminals. Initiates had to survive a year as a hermit, without any shelter but trees, and commune with the spirit world. Those that survived this initiation gained the knowledge of penning [[spell]]s on [[parchment]]-like tree bark with [[ink]] made from berries.",
                "Merchantile": "Some dakon took up the role as a merchant and frequently traveled, often on elephants, in large armed caravans. The merchandise of these caravans would be carried either on the elephants or the head of caravan members. The trade goods that dakons exported included the aforementioned mine goods, ivory, and slaves. They traded these in exchange for fabrics, jewelry, rugs, metallic mining tools, and any other richly colorful items that dakons considered to be exotic.",
                "Outcast Magic-Users": "Sometimes a sakir initiate became tempted by offers of power and arcane knowledge from [[fiend]]s. Such dakons remained hermits and became a [[witch doctor]], known to the dakon as a ''zara''. They typically retained their alignment, but eventually their quest for power would bring them to become [[chaotic evil]]. In some extreme cases, they even became possessed."
            },
            "Homelands": "Dakons were typically found in the jungles of tropical regions and seldom seen anywhere else.{{Cite dungeon/34/On Wings of Darkness|58}}",
            "Religions": "The belief system of dakon was based on the existence of a [[Spirit World]], that was inhabited by [[fiend]]s and the spirits of their ancestors'. These spirits were considered to have a [[lawful neutral]] disposition and, comparable to a [[demigod]], capable of influencing the material world through possession or [[magic]].",
            "Languages": "Dakons had their own language and had a reasonable grasp of [[Common]], but very few were fluent in speaking it. Their own language was largely based upon body posture, finger and hand gestures, hoots, and grunts. They also were capable of imitating animal noises, howling to communicate at long distances. Most could communicate with apes to a limited degree.",
            "Relationships": "Dakons were on best terms with other intelligent apes, such as [[grommam]]s. They tolerated the presence of primate-like or monkey-like beings, such as [[hadozee]] and [[banderlog]]s, the latter of whom they often fought alongside against their common foes.{{Cite dragon/187/Ecology of the Dakon|27}} In addition, through their innate ''animal friendship'' ability they kept a variety of primates as pets and guard animals, such as gorillas, [[monkey]]s, and even [[carnivorous ape]]s.{{Cite dragon/187/Ecology of the Dakon|26}} The latter of whom would often be used to track down, flush out, and retrieve wild game. Dakons also domesticated elephants as [[mount]]s, which would be used while hunting or in trade caravans.\n\nThey had neutral relationships with most [[demihuman]]s, [[human]]s, and [[needlemen]]. While most [[humanoid]]s and [[giant]]s were treated with antipathy. The creatures that they vehemently hated and would attack on sight were the [[qullan]], [[tasloi]], and [[yuan-ti]]. Banderlogs, humans, and tasloi in addition to [[elves]], [[gnoll]]s, [[kobold]]s, and [[orc]]s were the races that dakons most often took slaves from."
