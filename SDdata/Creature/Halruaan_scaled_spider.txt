Halruaan scaled spiders were extremely aggressive magical creations of an unwitting wizard from Halruaa who was exiled after his spiders escaped into the wild. These magical beasts collected treasures, small enough to be dragged into their lairs. The spiders diligently guarded their diminutive treasure hordes. Very few individuals were brave or stupid enough to try to rob Halruaan scaled spiders as their venom was extremely potent and deadly. Unique to Halruaa, the spiders lived in its tropical warm and humid climate, oven nesting within hollows in the massive Halruaan bilboa trees.
