Tangler beetles were a species of giant beetle notable for their adhesive saliva.
The chitinous bodies of these beetles had a black coloration.
The most notable trait of these beetles was their sticky saliva, which was so adhesive it could hold fast a giant. However, a few minutes after exposure to air this saliva began to dry and lose its stickiness.
In the late 15 century DR, the Chang Emporium shipped tangler beetles alongside bombardier and fire beetles on the caravel Dragonfly to the city of New Velar, intending to have them sold by Lin-Woh as guardian animals. However, once there an offloading accident occured, leading cages to crash to the ground and unleash many of the beetles trapped within them.
