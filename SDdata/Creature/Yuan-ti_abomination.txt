'''Yuan-ti abominations''' were monstrous serpent-like creatures possessed of both great intelligence and powerful magic. They formed the highest major caste of [[yuan-ti]] society.

==Description==
Yuan-ti abominations resembled massive snakes, some {{SIrange|8|12|ft|long=yes}} long and weighing approximately {{SIrange|200|300|lb|k|long=yes}}, with scale-covered humanoid arms. Their scale patterns were variable according to tribe, but they had the wedge-shaped heads distinctive of venomous snakes.

==Combat==
Abominations often used [[scimitar]]s in melee combat. They also attacked using their fangs, delivering a powerful poison. Abominations did not wear armor, for their scales were more than enough to protect them.

==Abilities==
Abominations possessed various innate psionic abilities that made them deadly warriors: they could induce a severe aversion to snakes in any creature within {{SI|30|ft}} of them, forcing that creature to stay at least {{SI|20|ft}} from any snake they saw; they could produce acid to coat their scales, or change the color of their scales to match their surroundings; they could detect poison at will; and they could shapechange into the form of a viper of variable size.

Yuan-ti abominations could use the spell-like abilities ''[[animal trance]]'' and ''[[entangle]]'' at will; ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', and ''[[suggestion]]'' thrice each day; and ''[[fear]]'' and ''[[baleful polymorph]]'' (into a snake only) once each day. Some sources added that they could use ''[[snake charm]]'' and ''[[sticks to snakes]]'' once each day as well, or ''[[animal friendship]]'' on snakes at will.

Yuan-ti abominations in their own form were dangerously venomous and capable of both swimming and climbing easily.

==Society==
Unless one of the much rarer and more powerful [[yuan-ti anathema]]s was present, yuan-ti abominations were the leaders and masterminds of the yuan-ti, as well as the highest-ranking priests in each tribe's temple.

Abominations considered humans repugnant and barely tolerated [[yuan-ti pureblood]]. Like all yuan-ti, abominations found the body odor of humans repulsive.

==Ecology==
Abominations were obligate carnivores and preferred eating warm-blooded creatures. Their favorite meal were birds and [[human]]s.
