They had large bony shells &mdash the upper half known as a carapace and the lower half known as a plaston &mdash from which their limbs and head extended out from. While some species could hide themselves within these shells, others were incapable of doing so and thus could only plaster their limbs to the sides of their shells for protection.\nThese creatures were largely non-aggressive. They usually tended to hide within their shells when confronted with danger rather than, rather than fleeing or fighting. Though if seriously harmed, persistently abused, or persistently annoyed they would fight fiercely.\nGiant turtles had very long lifespans, ranging from thirty to up to a hundred and fifty years.\nThese creatures fought by using their giant jaws.\nArchelon ischyras An ancient, prehistoric species of giant turtle that in some places persisted well beyond the Days of Thunder.\nGiant snapping turtle A monstrous variety of snapping turtle. They were commonly found in large lakes or rivers.\nZaratan A gargantuan species of giant turtle that were often mistaken for islands.

With those that dwelled in tropical regions being the most delicious.\nSome were known to transform the harvested carapaces of giant turtles into small huts, strong roofs, or even boats. Those that dwelled in tropical regions were said to have the most attractive of shells.\nSome claimed that there existed a species of giant turtle similar to the giant snapping turtle, but adapted to arid desert regions.\n* The Bone Throne within the Dungeon Level of Undermountain was partially made from the plaston (under carapace) of a giant turtle.\n* Those who specialized in sea-based magic could summon a giant sea turtle with the spell monster summoning VIII."
