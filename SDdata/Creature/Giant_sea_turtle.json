        "mainbody": "'''Giant sea turtles''', otherwise known simply as '''giant turtles''', were a monstrous variety of the mundane reptiles of the [[turtle|same name]].",
        "Description": "These creatures resembled the mundane sea turtle in all ways but size, including being very slow-moving. They had large bony shells &mdash; the upper half known as a carapace and the lower half known as a plaston &mdash; from which their limbs and head extended out from. While some species could hide themselves within these shells, others were incapable of doing so and thus could only plaster their limbs to the sides of their shells for protection.",
        "Behavior": "These creatures were largely non-aggressive. They usually tended to hide within their shells when confronted with danger rather than, rather than fleeing or fighting. Though if seriously harmed, persistently abused, or persistently annoyed they would fight fiercely.",
        "Biology": "Giant turtles had very long lifespans, ranging from thirty to up to a hundred and fifty years.",
        "Combat": "These creatures fought by using their giant jaws.",
        "Species": {
            "Archelon ischyras": "An ancient, prehistoric species of giant turtle that in some places persisted well beyond the [[Days of Thunder]].",
            "Giant snapping turtle": "A monstrous variety of [[snapping turtle]]. They were commonly found in large lakes or rivers.",
            "Zaratan": "A gargantuan species of giant turtle that were often mistaken for islands. They primarily inhabited the seas around Zakhara."
        },
        "Reputation": "Small boats were often capsized due to giant turtles surfacing from underneath them.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Giant turtles were an omnivorous species and would eat whatever they could find in their habitat. This included [[fish]], small mammals, insects like [[worm]]s, and fresh green vegetation. They had a distaste for carrion and rotting vegetation, but would resort to consuming them if starving.",
            "Habitats": "Giant turtles could be found in a variety of oceans and seas. [[Halruaa]], the [[Sarradra river]] in [[Neth Stand]],{{Cite polyhedron/136/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|9}} as well as the rivers and coasts of [[Phlan]].\n\nBeyond [[Faer√ªn]], giant sea turtles could be found around the island chain of [[Nada al-Hazan]] in the [[Crowded Sea]].\n\nBeyond Toril, these creatures could be found on the planet of [[Oerth]].",
            "Usage": "The meat of these creatures was considered a delicacy by many cultures, being very palatable and highly nourishing. With those that dwelled in tropical regions being the most delicious.\n\nSome were known to transform the harvested carapaces of giant turtles into small huts, strong roofs, or even boats. Those that dwelled in tropical regions were said to have the most attractive of shells."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that there existed a species of giant turtle similar to the giant snapping turtle, but adapted to arid desert regions.",
        "Trivia": "* The Bone Throne within the [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]] was partially made from the plaston (under carapace) of a giant turtle.\n* Those who specialized in sea-based [[magic]] could [[summon]] a giant sea turtle with the [[spell]] ''[[monster summoning VIII]]''.{{Cite dragon/220/Arcane Lore: Sea Magic|72}}"
