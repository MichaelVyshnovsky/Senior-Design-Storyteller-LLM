Examples included elongated arms, large noses, and other twisted features. Most had tattered insect wings. Unseelie could alter their size between  and .\nAll unseelie could become invisible whenever they wished. They enjoyed ambushing and terrorizing their victims.

Those unlucky enough to fall victim to this poison found themselves bound and tortured upon waking.\nUnseelie could cast a single spell once per day. They usually preferred casting spells that caused harm to others.\nthumb|273px\nSadistic by nature, unseelie took great pleasure from harming or even killing any who wandered into their territory. Even victims able to escape often did so with polymorphed appendages. Unseelie preferred to dwell in dark places like swamps, bogs, and twisted forests.\nThese creatures did not have a structured society. Anarchy reigned supreme among the unseelie with each individual behaving as they wished. The unseelie palaces were located on an invisible demiplane.\nThe unseelie were locked in a seemingly endless war with their cousins, the seelie. Conflicts between the two occurred in the Yuirwood of Aglarond. \nThough unseelie acquired their sustenance from their home demiplane, they tormented local animal populations purely for the joy of it.

Stories of the dark fey folk were common among the inhabitants of the region."
