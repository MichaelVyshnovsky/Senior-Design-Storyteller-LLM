A '''dragonscale slough''', also known as a '''dracolich slough''', was a type of [[undead]] [[animate]]

==Description==
These undead were slithering masses of dragon flesh and molted scales, infused with [[negative energy]]. They were capable of climbing up walls and ceilings.

==Behavior==
Dragonscale sloughs were inherently hostile undead. They were unintelligent, but exhibited many of the same attitudes and instincts as the dragon they were molted from. And they were found to gravitate towards sources of heat.

==Abilities==
These animates were vulnerable to [[fire]]-based [[spell]]s and effects, [[sunlight]], and the spell ''[[remove disease]]''.

==Combat==
These undead often scaled walls to drop down onto prey, who they would then proceed to try and constrict in their scales and suck out their life energy.
