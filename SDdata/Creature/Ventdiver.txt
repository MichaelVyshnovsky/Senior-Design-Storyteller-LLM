Ventdivers were a variety of fish found in the Sea of Moving Ice, named for their uncanny ability to survive in both normal waters and the noxious waters near thermal vents.
These creatures had high concentrations of rock oil within their swim bladders. Some speculated that it was somehow related to their uncanny ability to survive around thermal vents.
Ventdivers were a predatory, carnivorous species.
Around the Sea of Moving Ice, ventdivers were found in deep waters, in its trenches, around its thermal vents, and around Icecrag island.
