        "mainbody": "Barrowes were a kind of undead hill giant. By the , they were seen among the peaks of the Giants Run Mountains in increasing numbers, supposedly due to the Dodkongs campaign to expand Cairnheims influence.\nBarrowes were noted to look more repulsive than their living kin, with a thick covering of matted, dirty hair. As was typical of undead, their small eyes glittered.\nUpon becoming undead, barrowes became stronger, but less dexterous. They could also only be harmed by enchanted weapons.\nBarrowes did not value the companionship of each other, and even bore antipathy towards their living kin. They were known to destroy hill giant families, tribes, and raiding bands, simply for the pleasure of breaking up their bonds.\nBarrowes could drain energy by attacking with their fists, turning smaller opponents into weaker, miniature barrowes upon being slain. When hill giants were killed in this manner, they were raised as true barrowes.\nBarrowe lairs were like those of hill giants, although much less densely populated, typically sporting solitary or only very small groups. Due to the barrowes ties to the Negative Energy plane, the impact of these lairs on the local ecology was devastating, driving out any animals and withering the vegetation away in a quarter-mile (400 meters) radius.\nIt was rumored that, by substituting a regular hill giant with a barrowe in the process of making a potion of hill giant strength, the resulting brew would grant the undeads energy-draining attack on top of the normal increase in strength."
