        "mainbody": "'''Simurghs''', or the “'''King of Birds'''”, were avian creatures of [[Zakhara]] known to protect good-hearted lawful beings.",
        "Description": "Simurghs had the body of a [[giant eagle]], with the face of a [[human]]. Their feathers were metallic orange in color. These creatures had two pair of golden wings that could propel it quickly through the air. A simurgh’s long tail feathers could make a [[peacock]] jealous.",
        "Abilities": "Simurghs had an innate ability to cast the the following [[spell]]s: ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[infravision (spell)|infravision]]''. They could also cast the spells ''[[shape change]]'' and ''[[speak with animals]]'', but their effects were limited to birds and [[human]]s.\n\nA simurgh could also spread its wings, causing any creatures that viewed them to be hypnotized.",
        "Combat": "Simurghs were pacifists and would rarely enter into combat, even to save others.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Most avian creatures obeyed simurghs and many freely followed them like admirers. These strange flocks were only encountered far from human settlements.",
            "Usages": "The beautiful creatures were frequently hunted for their splendid plumage. If freely given, a simurgh’s tail feather had wondrous magical properties. These feathers radiated ''[[continual light]]'' and could ''[[hypnotize]]'' any creature within 50 ft. These feathers were used to make a ''[[robe of scintillating colors]]'' and also ingredients for making a ''[[potion of rainbow hues]]''. When used as a quill, they could be used to inscribe scrolls for ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', ''[[rainbow pattern]]'', ''[[prismatic spray]]'', ''[[prismatic wall]]'', and ''[[prismatic sphere]]''."
