Stone mephits were mephits composed of stone.
Stone mephits had the ability to breathe a violent stream of pebbles. Similar to gargoyles, they had the ability to appear as inanimate statues.
In the late 15 century DR, a number of stone mephits remained in the tower belonging to the Wizard of the Crag after it had long since sunk into the Marsh of Chelimber.
