'''Perytons''' were twisted and depraved [[Magical beast|magical creatures]] that appeared to be a cross between a [[giant eagle]] and a demonic-looking, fang-toothed stag. They were known and feared for tearing the beating hearts from their victims' chests.

==Description==
A peryton's feathered and winged body was about 7 feet (2 meters) long Its head, however, was covered in blue-black On the top of its head was a set of extremely sharp and strong antlers,

Whatever fell magic created perytons granted them a deceptively strong hide that was nearly impervious to anything but magical weapons.

Perytons reportedly smelled like humans, although others said the smell was indescribable and immediately triggered a sense of dread.

Perhaps the strangest feature of a peryton was its shadow. The shadow did not usually resemble the shape of the beast; instead, it was said to appear as the outline of whatever creature whose heart the peryton last ate, There was some controversy as to when and what shadow would be cast by a peryton. Some argued that the only time a peryton cast its own shadow was immediately after killing a victim but before consuming it. 

==Personality and Behavior==
Unlike the eagles they resembled, perytons did not glide at high altitudes. They preferred darting close to the ground. There were conflicting tales about their maneuverability on the wing. Some claimed that they were poor fliers, while others reported that they were so maneuverable as to be able to turn at a right angle at full speed over a distance of only two hundred yards.

Perytons were as intelligent as [[human]]s. but could be intelligent, patient, and cunning. Perytons would make detailed plans for a hunt, then carry them out meticulously. They would wait any length of time to achieve their aims, and though they might appear relaxed, they were ready for their prey.

[[File:Perytonattack.jpg|thumb|250px|''A [[monstrous peryton]] attacking a group of adventurers.'']]
They could understand at least [[Common]] and sometimes other languages, but they could not speak, at least not in words recognizable to most.  which was described as a series of pained or enraged screeches and roars, even human-like screams. By the 14th century, none had bothered, nor taken the risk, to decipher it.

They were perpetually unhappy creatures and despised their own existence, yet they were driven by a desire to kill others and someday ascend to a higher form of existence by the eating of a "perfect heart". The perytons believed that the perfect heart must always be eaten fresh, which was why they tried to tear it from living prey with their sharp talons. So strong was this desire that more intelligent perytons even kept and bred other creatures to harvest their hearts. or keep them as food.

[[Malar]] the Beastlord would sometimes send perytons to aid his followers or attack their enemies.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|13}}

==Combat==
[[File:Peryton.png|thumb|right|The silhouette of a peryton swooping down.]]
Perytons attacked by slashing with their horns, snapping with their ferocious jaws, or clawing with their deadly talons. They were adept at attacking with all three at once. They were especially dangerous when making swooping attacks.

Ruthless, they tended to focus on attacking weakest foes first, making surprise flyby attacks from behind cover, and then darting off again. If drawn into melee combat, they hopped about on the ground, using their wings to stay about 5 feet (1.5 meters) off the ground. Stronger perytons would sometimes carry smaller prey and drop them from great heights. Whichever target was chosen, a peryton rarely changed to a new one until either the target or peryton were killed.

Whenever an opponent was helpless or unconscious&mdash;whether from crippling, paralysis, ''etc.''&mdash;a peryton would attempt to rip the heart from the victim with its claws. It would immediately consume the organ.

==Society==
Perytons sometimes hunted in groups, but their chaotic natures made it difficult for them to cooperate. They often fought over prey, since they feared that someone else might have the chance to eat the perfect heart.

They usually nested in small groups of between two to eight perytons Nests were usually made several miles from their nearest neighbor.

==Ecology==
[[File:Peryton2e.gif|thumb|left|240px|A peryton in flight.]]Peryton females laid eggs with shells as hard as metal. It was said that acid was required to melt through the shells. Some scholars believed that the reason perytons consumed hearts was because of the high iron content of that organ, which was thought to be used in both the perytons' antlers and eggs and perhaps their skin and feathers. This heart had to come from a humanoidâ€”[[human]] for preference, but [[dwarf]], [[elf]], [[ogre]], and [[orc]] hearts would do, though some thought it specifically had to be human. She would only remain fertile for an extremely short time&mdash;between three and eighteen hours, during which time her shadow matched her form. She would then lay between one and four eggs at a time.

A peryton egg had an incubation period of up to a month. A hatchling had to be fed for the first month of life, then grew to maturity in only three months. The parent perytons often carried live prey to their nests, and watched as the infants killed and consumed them themselves. The young stayed with their parents for as long as a year, after which they left to establish their own nests.

Perytons were omnivorous and, apart from their need to eat hearts to reproduce, they could sustain themselves on vegetation. but they much preferred humanoid flesh, particularly that of a human, for the sake of eating their hearts. If they were successful in tearing out and devouring a victim's heart, the flesh of the corpse served as a meal.

Perytons faced few natural predators, but one notable exception was [[griffon]]s, which were powerful enough to hunt them.{{Cite dragon/161/The Ecology of the Griffon|93}}

===Habitats===
Perytons preferred living in temperate climates, in forests, mountains, and hills, the [[Nether Mountains]]; the [[Giant's Run Mountains]], where they roosted in old [[giant]]-sized palaces; the [[Starspire Mountains]], the [[Walls of Halruaa]]; the [[Lonely Moor]], a part of the [[High Moor]]; in the [[Goblin Marches]] and the [[Stonelands]]; the northern [[Thunder Peaks]]; and the mountains of [[Turmish]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/96/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Mysterious Turmish|5}}

In the Stonelands and southern Goblin Marches, perytons were an incessant threat to [[goblin]]s, [[orc]]s, and the other tribes that dwelled there. Very few goblinkin and orcs possessed magical weapons that could pierce their tough hides, giving them little defense against peryton attacks. From there, they often swooped upon caravans passing through [[Tilver's Gap]]; sometimes, a single large caravan would be harassed several times by perytons of different nests. Travelling east of [[Arabel]] got to be so hazardous in the 1360s [[DR]] that groups in [[Cormyr]] pushed for an mounted aerial division of the [[Purple Dragons]] to combat them. The careful perytons themselves nested over [[Tilver's Gap]] to avoid competition with [[griffon]]s elsewhere in the [[Storm Horns]] and to avoid the defenses at [[Castle Crag]].

==History==
Clearly magical beasts, perytons were widely viewed as having had a magical or otherwise unnatural creation. No one knew for sure how they'd come to be, but there many theories had been put forward.

An alternative and perhaps more sinister tale was put to paper by Brother [[Delf]] of [[Verdusk]], apparently relating an ancient legend. He told that perytons had once been the [[Khala]] of [[Imaskar]], a human race of evil [[Bane]]-worshipers. As punishment for their crimes, they were cursed by five gods of law. [[Lathander]], god of the dawn, said "You have been swift as an eagle in your flight from justice, so I curse you each of you with the body of the eagle." [[Mystra]], goddess of magic, said "Fierce as a wolf have you been in your persecution of the innocent, so I curse you with the teeth of the wolf." [[Torm]], god of duty, said "Foolish as a stag in rut have you been as you shunned what is true and good, so I curse you all to bear the head and horns of the stag." [[Ilmater]], god of suffering, said "You have tormented and torn heart and soul from your victims, so I curse you with unnatural appetites, so that you may only live and prosper after devouring the hearts of your prey." Finally, [[Mielikki]], goddess of the forest, said "While you acted as beasts, your heart contained evil which only humans can know. I curse you to always cast the shadow of the humans you once were, to always remind you of your terrible deeds and of the souls that you have lost." Thus, they became the perytons. This tale was unsupported by fact, but it did explain all their unusual human traits. However, some, like [[Talyssa Strongbow]], considered it ironic that their curses, particularly that of Ilmaterâ€”who aimed to shield folk from sufferingâ€”only drove the peryton to further murder and savagery. This cast doubt on the tale, or on the wisdom of the gods.

In the {{YearlinkName|1267}}, perytons, along with [[Harpy|harpies]] and [[manticore]]s, destroyed the city of [[Lis]] in the [[Moonsea]] region in what was known as the [[Flying Plague]].<ref>

Sometime around [[1372 DR]], King [[Obould Many-Arrows]] made an arrangement with the perytons living in the [[Spine of the World]] to defend his eastern border. In exchange, he granted them prisoners for heart-harvesting. This allowed him to focus his attentions on the [[Silver Marches]].

Around [[1374 DR]], they were being stabled by the [[Zhentarim]] as mounts within the [[Temple in the Sky]].<ref>

Sometime following the [[Spellplague]], while exploring the [[Savage Frontier]] for his new tome [[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to Monsters'']] the famed [[Volothamp Geddarm]] was attacked by a peryton on a crag overlooking [[Phandalin]] and lost his left eyebrow in the process.{{Cite dragon+/8/Volo's Guide to Befriending Giants}}

==Rumors & Legends==
A disturbing rumor circulating in [[Tilverton]] in the midâ€“14th century told that a lowland nest of perytons in the Stonelands kept captive humans, elves, orcs, and [[ogre]]s. As the story went, they tended to and even cared for them, as a farmer would their cattle, because they slaughtered these poor folk for their hearts and for food for the whole nest. Some they kept alive for breeding, to replenish their stock.

==Trivia==
The year [[1128 DR]] was named the Year of the Peryton.
