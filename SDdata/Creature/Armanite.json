        "mainbody": "'''Armanites''' were a form of [[centaur]]ic [[tanar'ri]] that served as the heavy cavalry of demonic armies, furiously charging into battle with savage bloodlust. When not racing across the blasted plains of the [[Abyss]] in disorganized mercenary companies, armanites surged out from its infinite depths to make war with all that was [[law]]ful and [[good]].",
        "Description": "Armanites looked like [[undead]] centaurs with [[ram]] or [[bull]] horns sticking out from their brows, standing {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall at their haunches and {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall overall. Their hauntingly pale complexions were made more eerie by their sagging stomach flesh, with older armanites looking practically gutted. Their seemingly sickly upper halves were covered with festering sores, while their lower halves were more muscular, contributing to their astonishing weight of {{SI|2600|lb|k|long=yes}}. Their tails were long, serrated, and covered in the same stiff bristles and spines that constituted their manes, which protruded out from the gaps in their armor. Curved claws and spiked hooves made them all the more terrifying.\n\nAll wore full-plate [[barding|armor]] that was constructed of demonic chitin and heavier than it might first appear. The black, fluted barding they wore seemed to be more ornamental than utilitarian in purpose.\n\nSome armanite breeds had [[kangaroo]]-like lower halves with hands as opposed to front legs, capable of manipulating small items, and weaponry.",
        "Personality": "Armanites fully understood their role on the battlefield and savored it, Despite their excellent service they were also arrogant and fickle beings that were not shy about leaving a battle even at its climax. If not rewarded the plunder they expected for their services, or if given orders they didn't like, they would desert or even rebel against their employers.\n\nArmanites were clannish and territorial demons that forbade any trespassers within their lands.",
        "Abilities": "Armanites were practically living weapons with their sharp hooves, talons, and tails allowing them to rip their foes to pieces with ease. Outside of their natural weaponry, more powerful armanites could let loose lances of lightning against their enemies.\n\nArmanites could also fly by galloping into the air for a maximum of one hour a day. They began flying slowly into the air, seemingly running up an invisible hill, and could not stop or quickly change directions while they did so. If the need arose, armanites could summon a small crowd of [[dretch]]es or another armanite to their aid.",
        "Combat": "In addition to their natural weapons, many armanites were walking armories, wielding many different weapons kept immaculately clean and covered in Abyssal runes, ranging from [[crossbow]]s, [[composite bow]]s, [[shortbow]]s, [[lance]]s, [[halberd]]s, [[sabre]]s, [[flail]]s, [[longspear]]s, flanged [[mace]]s, and flamberge [[sword]]s.\n\nAlthough tactically efficient and able to cooperate, armanites depended on the speed of their stampedes rather than timing or planning. They were efficient as mobile shock troops, striking with stunning speed before retreating and striking again. Their aerial charges especially were effective against foot soldiers, and designed to wreak maximum mayhem and carnage.\n\nAfter wading into combat they normally switched from their spears or lances to other melee weapons like flails, wildly kicking and rending their opponents throughout the battle in whirlwinds of destruction.",
        "Society": {
            "Relations": "Armanites loathed and often abused least tanar'ri, including manes, dretches, and [[rutterkin]], although rutterkin were infrequently taken into armanite herds to serve as servants, smithies, grooms, and auxiliary riders. A [[hezrou]] might work with a troop, but they also refused to cooperate with [[bulezau]] demons. \n\nArmanites hated their goodly counterparts the [[bariaur]] and immediately attacked them."
        },
        "Biology": {
            "Diet": "Both the body and spirit was consumed by armanites, a substance legends purported they enjoyed above all others. This process could leave someone incapable of being resurrected. Their favorite foods consisted of Abyssal bats, baatezu, and [[yugoloth]]s, in that order."
        },
        "History": "The first armanites were from six clans of [[Feywild]] centaurs that had been enslaved and twisted by [[fomorian]]s before escaping and stumbling upon a portal to [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 1: Plain of Infinite Portals|Pazunia]]. After time spent in the realm of demons some turned into demons themselves, abandoning their proud heritage in favor of becoming abyssal mercenaries.\n\nDuring one of the hotter points of the [[Blood War]], many armanites worked with the similarly blood-crazed bulezaus of [[Baphomet]], and their combined assaults were core to the defeat of [[Nine Hells|Hell's legions]]. When the equally violent demons attempted to claim the spoils of war, conflict broke out on who would take what. The grudges from these battles are still seen in the inability of both demons to cooperate. many switched to serve under demons like [[Demogorgon]] or [[Kostchtchie]], with bands who worked with the Horned King being rare and usually doing so briefly.\n\nDuring the [[Fiend Wars]] of the {{YearlinkName|729}}, a troop of armanites fought in the [[Scaled Horde]] under the [[half-fiend]] [[Berdrinnar]].",
        "Known Armanites": "The demon lord Graz'zt was known to employ a group of eight armanites—four white and four black—to draw his carriage.\n\nThe Amber Stallion was an armanite whose [[true name]] was unknown, even to those closest to him, for fear of magical manipulation. He led some of the most prosperous and numerous armanite herds."
