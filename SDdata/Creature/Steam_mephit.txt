'''Steam mephits''' were [[mephit]]s composed of [[water]] and [[fire]]. They left trails of hot water when they moved, and considered themselves the lords of all mephits.

==History==
In the ancient city of [[Cursrah]], steam mephits used their special talents to help clear clogged drains in the city's sewer system.
