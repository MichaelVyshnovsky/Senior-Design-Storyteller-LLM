Choldriths were the priest race of the chitines in the Underdark.
Choldriths had eight slender legs (although the front two served as arms) and resembled bloated white spiders about  in diameter. Their faces resembled those of chitines, with some humanoid features, faceted eyes, and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Their ears looked like horns.
When possible, choldriths used their chitine subordinates as fodder to shield them in battle while they used their clerical spells.
They could spin webs like a spider, and could throw out net-like webs to ensnare foes up to  away. Also like a spider, their bite was highly venomous.
Choldriths were priests and spellcasters. They lived alongside chitines in villages inside caverns filled with maze-like webs. In the center of the cavern was always a temple to Lolth. Choldriths served as the leaders of each village, as they were seen as blessed by Lolth.
Choldriths were found alongside chitines in the upper and middle-Northdark.
Choldriths were said to have been created by Lolth herself. It was believed that transformation into a choldrith was a kind of twisted reward bestowed by the Spider Queen on those who passed her tests, not unlike how transformation into a drider was a punishment for failing her tests.
