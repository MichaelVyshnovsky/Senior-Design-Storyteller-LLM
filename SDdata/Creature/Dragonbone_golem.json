        "mainbody": "A '''dragonbone golem''' was a [[construct]] created by utilizing the bones—or even entire skeletons—of [[dragon]]s and other non-organic material to bind them together.",
        "Description": "These constructs were formed utilizing the inherent magic that existed within all dragons. Individuals bones were etched with arcane [[rune]]s or glyphs that allowed the magic to freely flow throughout its form, then linked together by [[adamantine]] bindings, or other similar means.",
        "Abilities": "Like the living dragons from which they were made, dragonbone golems still emanated an aura of doom that instilled terror in nearby creatures.\n\nLike other [[golem]]s, these creatures did not need to sleep, drink, or eat for sustenance, they could not succumb to exhaustion, nor did they require breathable air. They could not be [[poison]]ed, [[charm]]ed, paralyzed, or [[petrification|petrified]]. Like their draconic namesakes, they possessed an inherent resistance damage inflicted by adamantine weapons,{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|26}}",
        "Behavior": "Dragonbone golems possessed an animal-level intelligence and were to be extremely obedient to their masters.",
        "Combat": "When engaged in battle, dragonbone golems slashed with their claws, attempted to pin smaller foes down to the ground, and incapacitated them with their [[petrification|petrifying]] breath weapon.",
        "Creation": {
            "Notable Creators": "The [[Inquest]] of [[Xorvintroth]] on [[Abeir]] created dragonbone golems utilizing clockwork machinery. These golems featured vicious spikes that lined their form and were uniquely studded with green crystals.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|19}}"
