        "Description": "Reef giants had white hair and coppery skin. They normally stood {{SI|16|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|4000|lb|k|long=yes}}. They were more barrel-chested than other giants from swimming through the ocean water. When on land they wore clothes made of either hide or braided hair, but when underwater they wore only a belt to carry their weapons and [[pouch]]es.",
        "Abilities": "Reef giants were able to make a whirlpool with a radius of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} around them once a day. This ability was able to suck in other creatures and drown them, but was not powerful enough to affect ships. Additionally, the giants were immune to water- and ice-based magic.",
        "Combat": "All reef giants preferred fighting underwater. Their favored weapon was a giant [[trident]], but they would use their fists if necessary. They also threw boulders when attempting to sink ships, although they did not bother to do so when fighting individual enemies.{{Cite dragon/254/...The Harder They Fall}}",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]], many told of a large mass of reef giants emerging from the seas of Zakhara and marching northward, bearing a monstrous [[turtle]] on their backs. Some believed this was in fact the [[zaratan]] that the [[Temple of Endless Waves and Wind]] rested upon in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].<ref>",

            "Religion": "Some reef giants were known to worship [[Istishia]], going so far as to become [[waterwalker]]s."

        "Notable Reef Giants": "* [[Coral (reef giant)|Coral]], a female reef giant who lived on her own island in the Dragon Reach south of [[Ravens Bluff]].\n* [[Coralton]], a male reef giant who lived in the Sea of Fallen Stars in the 14{{th}} century DR. He had turned to the ways of [[necromancy]] in order to plot and act against his fellow reef giants."
