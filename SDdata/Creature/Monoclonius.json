        "mainbody": "Monoclonius (), also known as centrosaurus, or onehorn in the jungles of Malatra, was a species of dinosaur living in Faer√ªn.\nMonoclonius resembled a triceratops, but instead of three horns it only had one, above its snout. Their body was protected from the front with a thick, bony head crest. It had very thick skin. Its head was very flexible, allowing it to turn it rapidly.\nTheir horn was strong and sharp, giving them an effective natural weapon against predators. Their skin was thick enough to protect them from all but the sharpest claws. For small predators, a herd of monoclonius tended to merely stampede over them.\nAt some point in the 14 century DR, Chultan dwarves trained a pair of monoclonius to act as beasts of burden, carrying rock and debris away from the Wyrmheart Mine as well as its emeralds to settlements along the coast for trade.\nMonoclonius lived in herds.\nMonoclonius were a herbivorous species of dinosaur.\nMonoclonius were one of the many species of dinosaur that inhabited Chult."
