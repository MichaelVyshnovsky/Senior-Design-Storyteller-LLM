The '''Steppe horse''' or '''steppe pony''' was a rather homely but deceptively powerful breed of [[horse]] that was native to the steppelands of the [[Plain of Horses]] in northwestern [[Kara-Tur]] and was found in [[northeast Faerûn]] and the [[Hordelands]].

==Description==
Looking unlike any other horse breed in Kara-Tur,

==Abilities==
While they were not graceful or imposing, Steppe horses possessed heroic stamina, strength, and resilience, and could run at a swift pace for great distances, despite their short legs, even with a rider. Their thick bones gave them their strength and a robustness against blows that enabled them to resist attacks. A ''huluk''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> ribcage was almost a solid wall of bone, giving them the greatest protection. Their thick, shaggy hide also provided protection.

Although small, a Steppe horse's strength enabled it to carry the loads of a larger steed.

==Behavior==
A fearless and aggressive horse, they had a steady temperament and were quite reliable on the battlefield. In fact, Steppe ponies did not need to be trained for warfare and they did not shy away from clashing weaponry, loud noises, or fire and rarely panicked

In particular, ''huluk'' had an instinct to fight and were even considered violent. Even ''huluk'' colts were known to kill [[wolves]]. On the battlefield, a ''huluk'' would keep charging and attacking after their riders were slain. For this reason, Plainsmen used ''huluk'' to lead charges.

==Tactics==
A Steppe pony fought by kicking with its front legs and by biting and trampling.

==Homelands==
These horses roamed wild on the steppelands of the northern Plain of Horses.

A herd of wild ''huluk'' was found in the [[plane]] of [[Qui]], grazing in lush valley meadows during its Season of the Unicorn. They would attack visitors and fight to the death.

==Ecology==
Wild Steppe horses usually form herds of around 50 to 100, but could be as few as 20 and as many as a 1,000. Normally, 60% would be classes as medium warhorses, 20% as light warhorses, and 20% as heavy warhorses, and only 10% as the exceptional ''huluk''.

Due to the rather sparse vegetation of their native lands, Steppe horses could sustain themselves by grazing alone and did not require grain or other feed to survive.<ref> While lesser horses would grow weak on the sparse steppeland grasses, Steppe horses flourished. Moreover, it did not matter what kind of vegetation; when needed, a Steppe horse would grind the hardest, driest feed in their strong jaws or use their hooves to smash through ice to get at frozen moss. They also only needed to be given water once a day. They could survive in both hot and cold weather.

Steppe horses were the most prized resource of the nomadic Plainsmen tribes. The [[Kashghun]] tribe at the city of [[Chegoyui]] in the [[Quoya Desert]] traded them to [[Shou Lung]] and they were a regular source of prosperity for the tribe. The horse-trader [[Marash Rashi]] was the most successful there. The [[Tsu-tsu]] tribe were able breeders, while the [[Igidujin]] launched raids to steal them. For taxation purposes, one horse was counted as equal to one [[cow]] or seven [[sheep]] or half a [[camel]].<ref>

Outside the Plain of Horses, Steppe horses were commonly employed by the various other nomadic tribes of the Hordelands. Steppe horses were commonly ridden by Tuigan warriors and their ''khans'', and even by General [[Hubadai]] and his nightguards.<ref> They were considered one of the key weapons of the Tuigan, accounting for their rapid movements in war. 

However, in [[Faerûn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these horses were not highly valued or sought after. They were only familiar to the peoples of the [[Endless Wastes]] and [[Rashemen]], where the [[Tuigan]] tribes and [[Rashemaar]] regularly rode Steppe horses. They were also known in [[Thesk]], but did not go for high prices, typically only 70 [[gp]]. Elsewhere in Faerûn, they were not known at all and were nigh impossible to obtain. Nevertheless, they offered a specific appeal to certain breeders looking to enhance their own stock with greater strength or stamina and they might pay extra. The Steppe horse was among the breeds bred into the [[Sosser]] employed in [[Sossal]] and elsewhere in [[north Faerûn]].<ref>

By around [[1479 DR]], however, the [[Vaegould]] tribe of the [[the Ride]] in [[north Faerûn]] also rode steppe ponies.As the Ride is also steppeland, it is possible the Vaegould's steppe ponies are a local breed, but they are included here for convenience.

[[File:Tuigan Courser.png|thumb|right|250px|''An adventurer riding a Tuigan courser near Neverwinter.'']]
''Circa'' [[1479 DR]], Tuigan coursers were among the valuable warhorses that could be summoned from ''[[crystal charger]]s'', which were sold in [[Neverwinter]] during the [[Simril]] winter festival.

==Significance==
On the Plain of Horses, Plainsmen soldiers formed close bonds with their Steppe horses. Before any mission or battle, they would explain the plan in detail to the horse; they thought it was good omen if the horse listened attentively, and a bad omen if the horse snorted and bucked. These horses were so valued that, if food supplies were limited, they would feed their horses before their own families. This was due to their remarkable kindness to animals. Horse-racing was also a popular pastime.<ref> Horse-wrestling was also practiced by the [[Fankiang]] tribe.

==History==
Around {{YearlinkConvert|2600|SY}}, [[Razak Irdi]] of the city of [[Chegoyui]] in the [[Quoya Desert]] stole one of the most valuable ''huluk'' belonging to the ''qaghan''. He fled north and remained apart ever since. He preferred the company of wild horses and always traveled with a herd, numbering 20–50.

For thwarting the plots of the disgraced [[pan lung]] [[Za-Jikku]] ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|1776|WY}}, Daimyo [[Osari Daizan]] of [[Tifuido]], [[Wa]], presented a band of [[adventurer]]s with many gifts and rewards, including a ''huluk'' imported from the Plain of Horses.

''Circa'' [[1350 DR]], a [[halfling]] [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] of [[Verdusk]] named Brother [[Twick]] journeyed to the [[Farsea Marshes]] in order to minister to the [[Marsh Drovers]] and for the expedition, he took a sturdy steppe pony. Their combined weight caused an earth collapse, dropping them into a mud pit, where they were stranded until rescued by the Marsh Drovers, after which they continued to their village.<ref> Next, Twick rode his pony to the [[Tun Marshes]].<ref><ref group="note">It is unknown if Twick's steppe pony originates from the Hordelands or is from a closer steppeland, but this is included here for convenience.

==Notable Steppe Horses==
* [[Dohju]], prized ''huluk'' formerly of the qaghan of Chegoyui, later a companion of Razak Irdi.
