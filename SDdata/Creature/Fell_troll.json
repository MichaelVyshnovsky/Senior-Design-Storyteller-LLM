        "mainbody": "Fell trolls, otherwise known as giant two-headed trolls, were one of the largest types of trolls in the Realms. Some believed that they were a cross-breed between trolls and ettins.\nFell trolls stood taller than most hill giants, standing at  tall, and had two heads atop its body that were filled with large, sharp fangs. The hair that protruded from these heads was long, straight, and fleshy. It often writhed of its own accord.\nThe skin of fell trolls was thick and rubbery, with knotty protrusions, and ranged in tones from mottled moss-green to gray. These knotty protrusions were especially prevalent on their shoulders and back. They moved around with an ungainly, hunched-over posture. They tended to dress in a similar fashion to ettins, wearing the slowly rotting skins of animals.\nDue to them possessing two heads, it was difficult to use mind-affecting spells on a fell troll, such as charm and confusion, or otherwise deceive them by means of magic. Beyond that, they possessed the regenerative ability that was common to all trolls. However, giant two-headed trolls were earlier reported to not be capable of re-attaching their limbs.\nA fell troll viciously attacked its prey up close, latching onto their bodies with its claws and rending the flesh. It would alternatively try to bite at its prey with its massive maws. On very rare occasions, they would fight with some form of weapon.\nthumb|A giant two-headed troll, obviously.\nGlacier troll\nA type of two-headed troll that was endemic to the land of Ra-Khati. Unlike the standard fell troll, these creatures had icy, alabaster skin and were impervious to harm from fire.\nIn 1358 DR, giant two-headed trolls were often seen among bands of trolls that were locked in battle in the Trollmoors with the Riders of Nesm√© and elsewhere in the Savage Frontier with Waterdhavian troops.\nThese creatures were voracious carnivores and would attempt to feast on almost anything, though their preferred meal was humans. \nFell trolls were known to inhabit almost any type of region with a cold climate. They were known to prefer dark environments and thus tended to dwell in damp underground areas, leading groups of smaller trolls.\nFell trolls were primarily found in the Unapproachable East, being an uncommon sight in other areas of the Realms. and occasionally in the North. In the Trollbark Forest and Troll Hills, they were often leaders of bands of trolls.\nBesides Toril, two-headed trolls were known to be found on the planet Oerth.\nLike any type of troll, these creatures were known to speak the Giant language. \n* Dar-Guran, a possibly fictional fell troll from Rashemi folklore.\n* Dorig\n* Glarauuth, a self-proclaimed king who took up residence in the Dungeon of Death in the late 14 century DR.\n* Proffit, a two-headed troll who acted as a leader over a united force of trolls in the Trollmoors in the late 14 century DR."
