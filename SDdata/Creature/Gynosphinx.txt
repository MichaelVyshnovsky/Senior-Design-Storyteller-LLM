A gynosphinx () was a female sphinx
Gynosphinxes were known to be very knowledgeable and wise creatures. They preferred to pursue intellectual ideals. 
Gynosphinxes loved to collect knowledge and ancient lore, though they were also known to value gems and similar forms of wealth. They delighted in solving riddles, puzzles, and mental challenges. 
While not as physically powerful as an androsphinx, the gynosphinx was still a capable combatant and possessed a number of magical powers. Gynosphinxes were often known to be capable of casting the spells banishment, clairaudience/clairvoyance,  comprehend languages, darkness, detect invisibility, detect magic, dispel magic, identify, greater invisibility, legend lore, locate object, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, read languages, read magic, remove curse, shield, suggestion, tongues. They were also known to be skilled in the use of arcane symbols.
Gynosphinxes greatly detested criosphinxes, who often lusted after them.
They were generally known to demand payment from humans in return for their aid. Such payment could take the standard form of wealth, but also in the form of knowledge, poetry, prose, riddles, or even the location of an androsphinx. Failure to pay them often led to the offending humans being eaten.
Gynosphinxes were favored monsters of the dwarven deities Dugmaren Brightmantle and Vergadain and the Mulhorandi goddess Isis, often acting as their divine servitors and being sent as messengers to their faithful.
