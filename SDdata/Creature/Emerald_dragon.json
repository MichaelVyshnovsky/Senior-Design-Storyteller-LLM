        "mainbody": "'''Emerald dragons''' were a breed of [[gem dragon]] known to be inquisitive, often more knowledgeable than most sages, and for their striking [[emerald]] color.",
        "Description": "When a [[wyrmling]], an emerald dragon had translucent sea-green scales. As it grew older, its scales hardened Conversely, their pupils faded with age, so a [[great wyrm]]'s eyes were naught but blank green glowing orbs. On the whole, however, they were quite beautiful. \n\nA hatchling had a {{SIAdj|3|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} body and {{SIAdj|2|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} tail, while an adult had a body length of {{SIrange|45|54|ft|long=yes}} and a tail length of {{SIrange|35|42|ft|long=yes}}. The biggest great wyrms grew to {{SI|108|ft|long=yes}} long in the body, with tails {{SI|84|ft|long=yes}} long.",
        "Personality": "Emerald dragons were deeply inquisitive, with a keen interest in local customs and history.\n\nHowever, they also tended to be paranoid and distrustful of visitors, and their lairs often had many [[trap]]s. They were reclusive did not like anyone going anywhere near their hoards. Hence, it was very hard to make even a casual acquaintance with an emerald dragon, let alone learn what they knew.",
        "Abilities": "In place of [[dragon breath]], emerald dragons could instead make a loud keening wail. Its sonic vibrations In one version, this sonic assault could affect all in hearing range, which was {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} from its mouth for an adult and its effects could last up to an hour, but only made twice a day. In another, it was a more limited cone of sonic energy extending to {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} with effects lasting only up to a minute for an adult, but made much more frequently.\n\nHence, emerald dragons were naturally immune to [[:Category:Sonic_spells|sonic spells]].\n\nThe ever-shifting green shades of its scales could be quite distracting to those who saw it, and emerald dragons knew it. By undulating its body and rippling its scales in certain ways, it could hypnotize creatures watching it. After three minutes of dealing peaceably, an emerald dragon could take one by surprise with a sudden attack or flight, if it chose.\n\nThey might also generate a cloud of fog to blind opponents.\n\nLike any dragon, and in addition to the common powers of gem dragons, emerald dragons gained an array of magical powers as they aged, though accounts of these varied. Alternatively, young dragons could cast ''[[improved invisibility]]'' thrice a day, juveniles could produce a ''[[fog cloud]]'' thrice a day, adults could cast ''[[legend lore]]'' whenever they liked, old dragons could use ''[[clairaudience/clairvoyance]]'' and ''[[nondetection]]'' both thrice a day, and ancient dragons could ''[[sculpt sound]]'' thrice a day. Finally, great wyrms could use ''[[shield of prudence]]'' thrice a day, extending their senses into the future a few moments, granting them greater ability to defend themselves against surprise attacks. Psionic emerald dragons could use ''[[object reading]]'' rather than ''legend lore'', ''[[control sound]]'' instead of ''sculpt sound'', and ''[[augmented invisibility]]'' instead of ''improved invisibility''.\n\nSimilarly, emerald dragons could acquire and cast new [[spell]]s of their own, whether arcane or divine, but they were most noted for their talent in [[psionics]]. Those who were so gifted learned the psionic attacks ''[[psionic blast]]'', ''[[id insinuation]]'', or ''[[psychic crush]]'' and the psionic defenses ''[[mind blank (psionic)|mind blank]]'', ''[[tower of iron will]]'', or ''[[thought shield]]''. Common clairsentience powers for crystal dragons were ''[[aura sight]]'', ''object reading'', and ''[[precognition]]'' and common telepathy powers were ''[[contact]]'', ''[[mindlink]]'', ''[[ejection]]'', ''[[ESP (psionic)|ESP]]'', ''[[life detection]]'', ''[[probe]]'', ''[[sight link]]'', and ''[[sound link]]''.\n\nThey were skilled in acquiring information, hiding, and swimming.",
        "Society": {
            "Relations": "Emerald dragons were afraid of [[red dragon]]s for their rapacious greed and were openly aggressive to [[fire giant]]s.\n\nThey would occasionally have [[sapphire dragon]]s as their neighbors.\n\nEmerald dragons acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[deities]] [[Thard Harr]]<ref> and [[Amaunator]].<ref><ref>",
            "Lairs": "Emerald dragons preferred to live underground. they did prefer to dwell in areas close to some sort of civilization and people of any race, though not where they were likely to make their presence known. Even when on the [[Inner Planes]], they kept an eye on their favorite places back in the [[Material Plane]]."
        },
        "Tactics": "Distrusting all visitors, emerald dragons surrounded their lairs with alarms and concealed traps, both physical and magical, to give them timely warning. If intruders were not discouraged, the emerald dragon hid itself or turned invisible and used its powers to spy on them and rarely opened conversation. It would reveal itself only if the trespassers discovered the dragon, its hoard, or its hatchlings.{{Cite dragon/218/Dragon Intrigues|18}} Alternatively, they obscured their vision with a ''fog cloud'' before charging in or snatching foes while on the wing. Emerald dragons were very reluctant to get into melee with their foes, and would much rather weakened them as much as they could from a distance first.\n\nIf encountered at sea for some reason, an emerald dragon brewed up a storm somehow or smashed ships with its tail, starting with the masts before targeting the hulls. If feeling almost merciful, it would cause them to be becalmed or lost in fog or it would break a few masters, forcing the ship to limp back to port. If not, it would force a ship to a place it chose, interrogate the crew and examine the cargo, then take all it desired or ransom the ship, cargo, and, presumably, crew.\n\nFinally, if outnumbered or outmatched, an emerald dragon retreated and began plotting its revenge, and this could take years to play out.",
