'''Dimensional warpers''' were a species of extra-planar beings.
==Description==
Dimensional warpers had an unusual appearance. They resembled bipedal snakes, with a leathery skin and long, thin arms and legs. Instead of hands, they had claws that looked like hooks. Connecting their arms and legs was a wing-like membrane. They had large eyes with pupils similar to a cat, and a long, powerful tail similar to that of a lizards. Master dimensional warpers had a tattoo of various symbols which encircled their head and down their back.
==Personality==
Dimensional warpers were naturally curious and possessed an urge to acquire knowledge.
==Abilities==
Dimensional warpers had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of ''[[enlarge]]'', ''[[haste]]'' spells three times per day, and ''[[dimension door]]'' once per day. Highly trained dimensional warpers could duplicate the effects of ''[[time stop]]'' once per week.
==Combat==
Dimensional waprers did not engage in combat. Occasionally, a dimensional warper on a observation mission would attack a group of adventurers, to learn all it can about humanoid battle tactics and their emotional state in battle. In addition to their innate magical abilities, a dimensional warper's claws and strong tail were effective in melee combat.
==Society==
Little was known about dimensional warper society, even where they originated was a mystery. They observed, and rarely communicated with, [[humanoids]] of the [[Prime Material plane]]. The only dimensional warpers encountered on the Prime Material plane were masters. Master dimensional warpers were the eldest and most wise members of dimensional warper society.

What was known of dimensional warper society was that it was centered on the acquisition of knowledge. Nearly all dimensional warpers dedicated their lives to this purpose and as a result, most adult dimensional warpers were scholars. Dimensional warpers had their own language, and they easily learned the languages of whatever humanoids they were observing.
