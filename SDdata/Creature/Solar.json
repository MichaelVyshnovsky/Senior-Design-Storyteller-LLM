        "mainbody": "'''Solars''' ({{Pronounce|SO|lar|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) were the most powerful of all the [[angel]]s and indeed of most [[celestial]]s. Described by some as truly godlike, only a [[celestial paragon]] could be more powerful. Solars never took their own worshipers. Instead, they often served as the direct hand of the divine being to whom they owed their allegiance. Even the [[demon lord]]s feared these holy celestial beings.\n\nDeities known to employ solars as stewards included [[Corellon]], [[Horus-Re]], [[Ilmater]], and [[Milil]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}",
        "Description": "A solar had a deep, commanding voice. or coppery-gold, and its eyes were as radiant topaz. Solars stood about {{SI|9|feet|c|long=yes}} or {{SI|10|feet|c|long=yes}} tall and weighed about {{SI|500|pounds|k|long=yes}}.\n\nNot all solars appeared like this, however. For example, the solars in Corellon's court appeared rather as androgynous elves in shining white robes.",
        "Abilities": "Solars were powerful and influential entities, and only the most fearsome [[fiend]]s could rival them for power. Like [[planetar]]s, solars could pray for and cast [[divine magic]]al spells like the most powerful of [[cleric]]s.\n\nIn addition to the magical powers common to all angels, solars had innate access to a wide range of powerful magics, for which they did not need to pray. These were too many to list entirely here, but they included such wondrous magics as the ability to grant [[wish]]es, [[Greater restoration|to restore]] victims from ailments, and to [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrect]] the dead. They could create a [[Blade barrier|barrier of magical blades]]; trigger a massive [[earthquake]]; send [[waves of exhaustion]] over their enemies; [[Mass charm monster|charm large groups of monsters at the same time]]; make the effects of certain spells [[Permanency|permanent]]; [[Power word, blind|blind]], [[Power word, stun|stun]], or [[Power word, kill|kill]] with only a single word; and damage enemies with a [[prismatic spray]]. Solars could make themselves [[Invisibility|invisible]], [[commune]] directly with their deity, and control the weather. By touching a mortal, a solar could grant the ability for that creature to survive in any environment for up to 100 years.\n[[File:Solar1e.png|thumb|left|250px|''A solar bearing his traditional weapons.'']]\nA solar could emit a searing burst of holy, magical energy to burn away its enemies, and its gaze could strike blindness in its foes.\n\nSolars sometimes [[Summon monster|summoned]] the aid of other celestial beings. Those of [[lawful good]] philosophies tended to favor summoning [[ki-rin]]. [[Neutral good]] solars favored [[phoenix]]es, while [[chaotic good]] solars chose [[titan]]s. They were also known to [[gate]] in planetars or [[deva]]s.\n\nThey bore all of the same immunities and resistances of other angels and were surrounded by the same protective aura of good. Furthermore, they could only be permanently harmed by magically evil attacks from the most epic of foes; they could [[regenerate]] from any other injuries.\n\nLike planetars, solars could [[Darkvision|see in the dark]] and in [[Low-light vision|low-light]], They could always sense when someone was lying.\n\nOlder scholars even attributed certain [[Psionics|psionic]] abilities to the solars.\n\nSolars could take to the wing at immense speeds with good maneuverability, and were swift of foot as well. Beyond these physical means of movement, they could [[teleport]] short distances.\n\nSolars, like all other angels, could use [[Tongues|magic to speak any language]], They could also communicate telepathically within {{SI|120|feet|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "As with other angels, solars were always good in outlook, but some leaned more toward [[law]] and others more toward [[chaos|freedom]], though perhaps more commonly the former case was true. They were unmovable in their loyalty toward both their divine masters and their alignment. They truly were the epitome of such virtues as devotion, honor, and purity.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Solar2e.png|thumb|right|250px|''A solar about to nock a ''[[Arrow of slaying|slaying arrow]]''.'']]\nSolars had immense fighting prowess complemented by their magical angelic [[greatsword]]s as well as by [[composite longbow]]s that allowed the solar to enchant any arrow as a ''[[Arrow of slaying|slaying arrow]]'' when nocked. Their magical greatswords could hover in the air and fight by will of the solar's mind alone, falling only if the solar were destroyed.",
        "Society": {
            "Promotion": "Solars were created from the ascendancy of planetars as a reward of the gods that they served. Ascension was voluntary, but such an offer of promotion to so high an order as a solar was exceptionally rare.\n\nSimilarly, solars who failed to serve the cause of good could lose their powers and be reduced to a lesser form of angel. In the most extreme of cases, they are considered \"fallen\" and were exiled from the Upper Planes, stripped of their innate powers."
        },
        "Physiology": {
            "Lifecycle": "Solars were truly immortal beings and did not die of old age. In fact, as with other [[aasimon]], solars could not be permanently slain unless on their home [[Cosmology|plane]]. If their bodies were destroyed anywhere else, their life forces would return to their home plane, where their bodies would reform over a period of 70 years. On occasion, rather than returning to the form of a solar, the spirit would be changed into a [[Light (angel)|light aasimon]].",
            "Reproduction": "On rare occasions where a solar would take a mortal lover, his or her [[aasimar]] descendants would often have silvery or golden skin, bright topaz-colored eyes, or the traces of white feathers at the shoulder, as evidence of the celestial heritage."
        },
        "History": "In the [[Dawn Age]]s, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-30000}}, the solar [[Malkizid]] was cast down to the [[Nine Hells]].",
        "Notable Solars": "[[File:Zariel Descent.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''An artist's depiction of the solar Zariel before her fall to evil.'']]\n* [[Felarathael]] and [[Lashrael]], in service to Corellon\n* [[Gabriel]], in service to [[Bahamut]]\n*[[Malkizid]] (fallen)\n* [[Viryn]], in service to [[Tyr]]\n* [[Zariel]] (fallen)"
