        "mainbody": "A doomsept was a wraith-like undead creature created using the foul rituals found in the Codex of Araunt. They were bound to serve their creators, the Eminence of Araunt.\nDoomsepts resembled humanoid warriors. They wielded wraith-like weapons.\nDoomsepts were created by fusing seven different spirits into one being. Each spirit provided a unique characteristic or ability to a given doomsept.\nAccording to some legends, if the name of one of the spirits that composed a doomsept was said loud, the doomsept stopped all activity and the called spirit was compelled to answer the caller, as if under the effect of a speak with dead spell. After all answers were given, the doomsept resumed its attack, this time more viciously.\nDoomsepts were mostly found protecting tombs and mausoleums across Laerakond, or in the deathways."
