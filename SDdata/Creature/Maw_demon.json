        "Description": "A maw demon resembled an enormous toothy mouth surrounded by a small plethora of stubby appendages.{{Cite adventurers league/Fire, Ash, and Ruin|8-10}} Their ugly hides were a shade of dull brown.",
        "Behavior": "Maw demons were dim and simple, only understanding two concepts; hunger and food. They were not driven by anger or bloodlust, but by gluttony, preferring to consume as opposed to fight. Unfortunately, they favored meat as fresh as possible, desiring living flesh rather than something already dead, but if a fight would be too difficult, they would subsist on the next best meal. Prey that was already bloodied was even more likely to send them into a ravenous frenzy.",
        "Abilities/Combat": "The rending teeth of maw demons could do devastating damage to their victims, especially those that fell underneath them. Their appetite was so strong they could consume [[horse]]-sized creatures in under a minute. Lacking ranged attacks, their strategy rarely went beyond attacking the nearest foe with a preference for those that were already lying prone.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "Though maw demons could normally understand [[Abyssal]] (and perhaps [[Common]]), their lack of intelligence and overwhelming number of teeth made it practically impossible for them to actually speak, normally resulting in unclear noises."

        "Ecology": {
            "Subraces": "Although greater maw demons existed, these stronger, bulkier variants had nothing in the way of more developed brains."
        },
        "History": "A small group of maw demons served under a [[hezrou]] in the [[Land of Ash and Smoke]] within an abyssal void called the pit of [[Krahharu]]. They constantly stripped pieces of meat from the sacrifices made by the [[firenewt]]s above them and brought the pieces to their master, albeit after stealing small pieces for themselves."
