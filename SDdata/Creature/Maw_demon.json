        "mainbody": "Maw demons, also known as abyssal maws, In the Demonomicon of Iggwilv, they were counted as a form of unintelligent, demonic wildlife.\nA maw demon resembled an enormous toothy mouth surrounded by a small plethora of stubby appendages. Their ugly hides were a shade of dull brown.\nMaw demons were dim and simple, only understanding two concepts hunger and food. They were not driven by anger or bloodlust, but by gluttony, preferring to consume as opposed to fight. Unfortunately, they favored meat as fresh as possible, desiring living flesh rather than something already dead, but if a fight would be too difficult, they would subsist on the next best meal. Prey that was already bloodied was even more likely to send them into a ravenous frenzy. \nThe rending teeth of maw demons could do devastating damage to their victims, especially those that fell underneath them. Their appetite was so strong they could consume horse-sized creatures in under a minute. Lacking ranged attacks, their strategy rarely went beyond attacking the nearest foe with a preference for those that were already lying prone.\nEvil armies often used maw demons as shock troops, having them rush into the thick of combat straight away.  They were incapable of forming true alliances with other beings due to their dull brains, only serving other demons and spellcasters when forced.\nAbyssal maws were usually summoned by gnoll war bands through freshly made flesh sacrifices to partake in the destruction they brought. Maw demons present in a gnoll war band attacked anything the gnolls came across, but did not respond to commands or orders.\nThough maw demons could normally understand Abyssal (and perhaps Common), their lack of intelligence and overwhelming number of teeth made it practically impossible for them to actually speak, normally resulting in unclear noises.\nThe hunger of maw demons was infamously bottomless, for the living mouths were literally maws of the Abyss. After they rested for about eight hours, anything that a maw demon had devoured would be transported directly to the Abyss for further \"digestion\". In some cases, their meals were sent directly to Yeenoghus gullet.\nAlthough greater maw demons existed, these stronger, bulkier variants had nothing in the way of more developed brains. \nA small group of maw demons served under a hezrou in the Land of Ash and Smoke within an abyssal void called the pit of Krahharu. They constantly stripped pieces of meat from the sacrifices made by the firenewts above them and brought the pieces to their master, albeit after stealing small pieces for themselves."
