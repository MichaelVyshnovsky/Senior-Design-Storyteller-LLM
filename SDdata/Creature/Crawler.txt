Crawlers were small elemental vermin native to the Elemental Plane of Earth that could also be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Crawlers had a crested dog-like head with feelers located near the snout. Their sharp claws were used to dig through soil. Most crawlers were brown in color.
A crawler used its feelers to navigate in total darkness and to locate food. Crawlers survived by consuming vegetable and mineral matter. They were small but aggressive, leaping at attacking anything that disturbed them.
