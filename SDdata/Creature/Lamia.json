        "Description": "A typical lamia stood over {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall, measured {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} long, and weighed about {{SIrange|650|700|lb|k|long=yes}}. Most lamias appeared to be beautiful women from the waist up but had the bodies of powerful [[lion]]s from the waist down. However, these were the weakest forms of lamia. [[Lamia noble]]s had the lower bodies of serpents, which often led to them being confused with [[naga]], [[yuan-ti abomination]]s, or [[medusa]]s.\n\nThe lower body of a lamia could also resemble other animals such as [[goat]]s and [[deer]]. The upper body of a lamia was that of a [[human]] torso that did not have animalistic features such as scales, horns, or fur.",
        "Characteristics and Habits": "Lamias were sinister creatures who lived in desert ruins. They sustained themselves by eating human flesh. They use a variety of abilities, including seduction, disguise, ventriloquism, illusions, mirages, mirror images and other such things, to lure, entice and confuse those who wandered into their midst into dangerous situations. When they secured their victim, they carved a feast out of them with curved daggers. Lamias did not wear any form of clothing or other adornment. They seemed devoted to chaos and destruction in their native habitats. They never ventured more than ten miles (16km) from their lairs. Lamias also had the ability to drain wisdom with their touch.\n\nLamia society was matriarchal, believing males were good for nothing more than breeding and slave labor.\n\nLamias sought to live in excess, surrounding themselves with beauty and slaves. They were highly sexual creatures and mated often with captured males to produce offspring.",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "The lamia of the desert of [[Anauroch]] worshiped a wide variety of gods, including some [[human]] ones, but they were seeking for a \"true faith\" of their own."
        },
        "History": "The ''[[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]]'' claimed that the ancient [[obyrith]] [[Pale Night]] was the mother of the lamia race."
