'''Fey panthers''' were large, supernatural [[cat]]s touched by the energies of the [[Feywild]].

==Abilities==
Owing to having been touched by the [[magic]] of the Feywild, fey panthers could move between the [[Material Plane]] and Feywild during dawn and dusk. They could additionally step through the Feywild for brief moments even outside of these times, appearing to teleport short distances.

==Behavior==
Fey panthers were known to hunt much larger prey than did the [[panther|common panther]], even including [[humanoid]]s. Their temperament made them suitable as hunting animals and battle companions.

==Combat==
These beasts were stealthy, and were excellent climbers. They would hide in wait for the approach of prey, and then charge forward to pounce on their target and knock it off its feet. In battle, a fey panther's preferred strategy was repeated, ferocious pouncing.

==History==
Fey panthers were introduced to [[Faer√ªn]] following the return of the [[Feywild]] as a result of the [[Spellplague]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], they were present in [[Neverwinter Wood]], and would sometimes accompany parties of [[eladrin]] out of [[New Sharandar]].
