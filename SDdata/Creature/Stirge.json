        "mainbody": "'''Stirges''', also called '''Subawa Te''' – \"soul drum water eater\" in the [[Kukalatu language]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]], were a type of a tiny [[magical beast]] that fed upon the blood of other creatures.",
        "Description": "[[File:Stirge-MCVII.png|thumb|289x289px|''A stirge with feathered wings.]]\nThe bodies of stirges could be summed as resembling a monstrous cross between a large [[bat]] and an oversized mosquito,{{Cite dragon/239/Ecology of the Stirge|43}} On average their bodies grew to be {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length, with a wingspan of {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}}. Males and females were outwardly identical in appearance.\n\nTheir bodies were short and furry,{{Cite dragon/239/Ecology of the Stirge|44}} Their wings were membranous and bat-like, interlaced with thin-walled blood vessels. They had four legs that were eight-jointed and ended in sharp pincers, which were sometimes said to have a similar hue to their eyes. Their most prominent feature was their long, sharp needle-like proboscis, which was pink at the tip and faded to grey at the base.\n\nNewborn stirges were only capable of gliding, not flying, and thus spent the first four months of their lives being carried on their mother's back. Stirge mothers were capable of carrying up to two of their young on their backs.",
        "Behavior": "Stirges had an average animal-level of intelligence. Stirges were cannibalistic creatures and drained blood out of their recently dead kin.\n\nPerhaps the most curious behavior of stirges was singing. When the creatures were feeding, they \"hummed\" macabre tunes.",
        "Abilities": "The eyes of a stirge were capable of seeing in areas of [[darkvision|total darkness]], in areas with [[Low-light vision|low-light conditions]], and even heat sources within {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}} of them. They also had an acute sense of smell.\n\nWhile alive, their bodies produced a clear liquid that acted as an anti-coagulant and was stored within the tip of their proboscis. They drew small quantities of the blood they ingested into lesser cavities just beneath their backbone. Within these cavities blood sugar was converted into body energy and ingested blood into plasma balanced for its own bodily use. This allowed a stirge to replace its own blood when needed, hastening its recovery.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Stirgesfeeding.png|thumb|289x289px|''Stirges feeding on an unfortunate adventurer.'']]\nDuring battles, a stirge typically would indiscriminately attack any creature that was wounded. In small numbers they were quite manageable for most [[adventurer]]s, only becoming formidable threats when in large groups.\n\nThey used their pincer legs to latch on to their prey and then looked for a vulnerable spot of flesh to plunge their probosci into. Their legs themselves were not strong enough to be effective weapons. And due to their diet, their probosci were liable to transmit some [[disease]], typically those related to blood.\n\nOnce attached to its prey, a stirge would feed until it was sated. Once sated, it would attempt to fly away to digest its meal. It was difficult to remove a feeding stirge, with some saying the only way  was to kill it. They were so persistent, that a swarm of ravenous stirges would chase their prey for miles if need be.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Most stirges were content with feeding upon large mammals such as [[cattle]], [[deer]], and [[moose]], though some species preferred to dine particularly on the blood of [[human]]s.{{Cite dragon/83/Ecology of the Stirge|22}}",
            "Habitats": "Stirges were typically found in forests, underground, in caves, in ruins, or in marshes in areas with a warm climate.\n\nIn [[the Dalelands]], stirges inhabited [[Velarswood]] near the center of [[Harrowdale]], [[Mistledale]], [[Shadowdale]], and around the [[Pool of Yeven]].\n\nIn [[northwest Faerûn]] they could be found in the [[Ardeep Forest]] and [[Gaustar's Creek]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|9}}{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}} And in [[south Faerûn]] they could be found in the [[Duskwood]] of the [[Lake of Steam region]].\n\nIn the [[Unapproachable East]], stirges inhabited the [[Umber Marshes]] of [[Aglarond]].\n\nIn the [[Underdark]], stirges frequented the [[Bonewatch Pass]].",
            "Languages": "Stirges communicated with each other by wagging their probosci,{{Cite dragon/83/Ecology of the Stirge|21}}",
            "Relationships": "Stirges were capable of being bred in captivity.\n\nBoth [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s were known to sometimes capture stirges and use them in [[trap]]s.\n\nSome stirge colonies were known to live in symbiotic relationships with evil [[dragon]]s They also tended to lair near [[bloodthorn]]s in hopes of preying upon their ensnared victims.",
            "Usages": "If properly treated their proboscis could be used as a stabbing instrument. Goblins were often known to utilize them in this way.{{Cite dragon/83/Ecology of the Stirge|20}}\n\nThe muscle at the base of a stirge's wings could be safely eaten, although it had to be carved and cleaned very carefully and had to be prepared within a day of the creature's death. The flavor was similar to [[pork]] or [[sausage]], and it was sometimes served [[Baked stirge on toast|baked with toast]]. The [[Librarium]] on the first level of [[Undermountain]] contained a recipe book that described dishes that could be made with freshly killed stirges."

        "History": "A [[smoking pipe]] design, carved in a peculiar manner to resemble a stirge's skull popular in the 1200s DR and onwards.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-1-6 - Andred Kuroone, Lurandural Veltree, Jhalanavress Tanthavur, and Orstrar Galannavruk}}\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], stirges were known to be occasionally encountered in the sewers of [[Waterdeep]]\n\n''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], [[Lord Hund's Tomb]] had [[skeletal stirge]]s as part of its defenses. These undead creatures were immune to being ''[[Turn undead|turned]]'' as long as they remained in the tomb.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], the [[Shadowscale]] [[lizardfolk]] placed captured stirges inside sealed [[clay]] pots, which they would then hurl as grenades at their foes. The angry stirge would then attack the nearest living being, ignoring the undead Shadowscales.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The origins of stirges were a mystery. Sages who specialized in the [[zoology]] of fantastical creatures speculated that they were created by vampiric [[wizard]]s to throw hunters of the [[undead]] off their track. Others believed that they were created by a group of evil wizards, who gathered them in the millions and then sicked the beasts on enemy armies that were arrayed against them.",
        "Trivia": "* In the city of [[Arabel]], there was an inn known as the [[Red Stirge Inn|Red Stirge]].\n* Experienced [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s were usually capable of recognizing the traces of a stirge colony."
