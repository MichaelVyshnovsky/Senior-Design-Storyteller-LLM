The physical conditioning maintained by champions made them vigorous athletes who demonstrated exceptional endurance.

Due to their physical prowess and regular combat drilling, champions learned to master more fighting styles than other combatants. They became exceptionally adept at dealing fatal blows in battle.

The most battle-hardened champions could shrug off wounds that would down lesser combatants, appearing to heal their wounds in the middle of a fight.

==Notable Champions==
