        "Description": "Brain moles were only {{SI|3|in}} long and resembled ordinary moles.",
        "Behavior": "Brain moles were only dangerous in that they needed to eat psionic energy once a week or die; they did not attack except to defend themselves. In fact, brain moles were easily tamed and friendly as far as wild animals went.",
        "Abilities": "Brain moles had some minor psionic abilities in the form of ''mindlink'', ''mindwipe'', ''contact'', ''mind thrust'', ''psychic drain'', and ''psionic sense''.\n\nHowever, if they fed upon psionic energy from a creature that was not naturally psionic, but instead using psionic energy by way of spells or items, there was a chance that the brain mole's feeding could cause insanity.",

            "Relationships": "Brain moles were known to [[favored monster|serve]] the [[duergar]] deities [[Laduguer]] and [[Deep Duerra]]."
