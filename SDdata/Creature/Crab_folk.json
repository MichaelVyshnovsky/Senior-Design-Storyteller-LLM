        "Society": {
            "Origin": "Crab folk were created from the ogre minions of a powerful green hag who wished to create an army of enforcers for the coastal terrain she had claimed. She also infused them with a magical compulsion for obedience.",
            "Homelands": "Crab folk made their home near coastal settlements, especially around their place of origin.",
            "Relationships": "Crab folk preferred to stay isolated from their neighbors, though certain triggers could lead them into brutal raids against nearby settlements of other races.",
            "Silver": "Especially important in crab folk society was the metal [[silver]]. The green hag that created them had an obsession with the metal. As such, she infused the crab folk with an insatiable love for silver. Crab folk would do anything to seize any source of silver they came across, even resorting to violence."
