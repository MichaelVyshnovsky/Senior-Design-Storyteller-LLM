        "mainbody": "Gorgons were large magical beasts that resembled a bull covered in dusky metallic scales.\nGorgons had an animal level of intelligence. Once a potential threat was petrified a gorgon would instinctively ignore the body.\nThe petrifying green vapor that gorgons exuded from their mouths somehow existed simultaneously on the material, astral, and ethereal planes.\nThis vapor was produced and stored in an internal organ that opened into the roof of their mouth. This organ would continue to function hours after a gorgon was killed. By the 14th century DR, scholars still had yet to uncover how it functioned. However, it was known that these vapors had no effect underwater and that they could easily be dissipated by an air elemental or similar force of moving air, such as by the gust of wind spell.\nThe irregularly shaped scales that covered a gorgon were composed of impure iron and coated in a waxy substance that helped to prevent them from rusting. This substance was perpetually exuded from cartilaginous seams between the scales. If a scale somehow succumbed to intense rusting it would fall off the body - this left the gorgon vulnerable, since they were incapable of growing new ones.\nthumb|A rare frozen gorgon specimen.\nAberrant Gorgons Gorgons that had been twisted by the Far Realm powers of Gyrion Farseeker in the late 15 century DR. As opposed to a dusky metallic sheen, these gorgons had a bluish hue to their bodies. A number of adventurers in the Sword Coast North were found to be riding them as mounts.\nCormanthor Gorgons This regional breed of gorgons had a special ability, which some said was granted by the deities of the Hexad. If they slipped into the river, they turned to stone and were saved from drowning because they no longer needed oxygen or food. Sometimes, these petrified gorgons might be washed onto the shore by a strong current and the sun would warm them, causing them to be restored to their normal form. It was not unknown for fishermen to pull the petrified gorgons out of the river, thinking them to be statues.\nFrozen Gorgons A species of gorgon created by a mad mage who experimented on replacing gorgons metallic plates with magical ice.\nGorgons were omnivorous creatures that required a lot of iron in their diet to maintain the durability of their scales. This was often obtained from blood and green vegetation.\nGorgons loved to eat fish. The Cormanthor gorgons flocked to the banks of River Ashaba and Elvenflow each spring when they flooded, so that they could collect the fish that were stranded there. Once the supply was depleted, a few of the gorgons were tempted to venture into the river to get more. Some of them fell in as a result, but their special ability could save them (see Species, Cormanthor below).\nThey were also known to have a fondness for deer and elk.\nThese creatures were typically found to live underground or in plains in regions with a temperate or tropical climate. Many preferred to live in wilderness that was relatively secure and free of danger.\nThe blood of a gorgon was a magical component used in masonry to prevent magical travel through walls. When one drop of blood was mixed with a pint of water during the mixture of stucco or mortar and applied with no unaffected areas larger than a mans head, it would prevent astral and ethereal travel through walls. When mixed with natural rubber, their blood could further be used as a sealant that prevented detection of magic, alignment, and temperature, such as in the construction of dead boxes.\nDrow in Old Shanatar used gorgon blood as an ingredient in forging gorgon plate mail, an armor said to be capable of protecting them against the suns harmful affects.\nTheir metallic scales could be used to make ink for scrolls of protection from petrification or fashioned into a set of scale mail that protected against petrification effects.\nGorgon milk was one of the ingredients in creating the hag treat known as \"Eye Scream\", along with newt eyes, blueberries, and swamp water. The recipe was detailed in the Witchs Brew Cookbook.\n* The Gorgotaur, a tauric gorgon who led the Cult of the Labyrinth dedicated to the demon lord Baphomet."
