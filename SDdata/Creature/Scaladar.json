        "mainbody": "A '''scaladar''' was a type of metallic [[construct]] created by the [[archmage]] [[Trobriand]] that dwelled within his domain in [[Undermountain]], known as [[Trobriand's Graveyard]].",
        "Description": "Scaladar were automatons made from [[iron]] that resembled mechanical [[scorpion]]s in both form and behavior. They possessed two large pincer-like foreclaws and a segmented tail that arced with electricity.\n\nAlthough the typical scaladar measured {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}}, models ranging from the sizes of [[war dog]]s to adult [[dragon]]s were constructed over the years.\n\nScaladar were controlled by a series of [[magic]]al [[ring]]s known as ''[[Trobriand's ring]]s''. Anyone wearing one of these items was protected from their ire and could command any of the constructs located within a {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} radius. Scaladar could understand their commands regardless of their known language. If a scaladar received contradictory commands from two individuals wearing these rings, it would immediately shut down for an hour. Naturally, Trobriand's personal ring superseded the commands given by any of the other ring-bearers.",
        "Abilities": "Like other constructs, scaladar were immune to [[poison]], could not be [[charm]]ed, and did not require food, drink, air, or sleep in order to live. They were resistant to many forms of damage and even absorbed electrical currents and lightning, channeling it through the \"stinger\" attached to the ends of their tails.\n\nAlthough primarily used in combat, scaladars could also use their tail stingers to join metal together in a manner similar to an [[arc welder]].\n\nThey were innately aware of any other scaladar located within a radius of {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Subtypes": {
                "Shadowclaw scaladar": ": Models with a composite body constructed and molded from black iron that was infused with [[shadowstuff]] that caused its claws to take on a dark color with a flickering effect. This hideous modified scaladar was a thing of nightmares. Instead of a lightning-based attack, these scaladars had a venomous sting that weakened the life force of those who encountered it.",
                "Winged scaladar": ": Models equipped with two giant insect wings made of sheet metal and colored glass shards, giving it a more fearsome appearance. Their tails were more flexible than those of baseline scaladars, and could curl downward when in flight and strike foes underneath it."
            }
        },
        "History": "By the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, Trobriand started sending scaladars directly to [[Waterdeep]]'s surface in order to dispose of his enemies in dark alleyways.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "It was supposed by some sages that automatons similar to Trobriand's modern scaladar were used in [[Myth Drannor]], [[Netheril]], and other ancient magic-boasting realms, and that some of these constructs still survived into the 14{{th}} century DR. Other sages, knowledgeable about [[spelljamming]], suggested that the Metal Mage's scaladars were derived from the smaller but frightening [[clockwork horror]]s, a theory supported by the fact that Trobriand kept a duplicate [[copper horror]] in his laboratory.",
        "Notable Scaladar": "* [[Squch]], an \"enhanced\" scaladar that possessed increased intelligence and took upon a leadership role within the Graveyard during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]"
