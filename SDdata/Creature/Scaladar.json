        "mainbody": "A scaladar was a type of metallic construct created by the archmage Trobriand that dwelled within his domain in Undermountain, known as Trobriands Graveyard.\nScaladar were automatons made from iron that resembled mechanical scorpions in both form and behavior. They possessed two large pincer-like foreclaws and a segmented tail that arced with electricity.\nAlthough the typical scaladar measured , models ranging from the sizes of war dogs to adult dragons were constructed over the years.\nScaladar were controlled by a series of magical rings known as Trobriands rings. Anyone wearing one of these items was protected from their ire and could command any of the constructs located within a  radius. Scaladar could understand their commands regardless of their known language. If a scaladar received contradictory commands from two individuals wearing these rings, it would immediately shut down for an hour. Naturally, Trobriands personal ring superseded the commands given by any of the other ring-bearers.\nLike other constructs, scaladar were immune to poison, could not be charmed, and did not require food, drink, air, or sleep in order to live. They were resistant to many forms of damage and even absorbed electrical currents and lightning, channeling it through the \"stinger\" attached to the ends of their tails.\nAlthough primarily used in combat, scaladars could also use their tail stingers to join metal together in a manner similar to an arc welder.\nThey were innately aware of any other scaladar located within a radius of .\nTrobriand would sometimes sell his scaladar to other mages, dwellers of the Underdark, and buyers encountered in Skullport, most commonly rich satraps from Calimshan and curiosity seekers from Lantan.\nthumb|right|Winged and shadowclaw scaladars.\nIn the years following the Spellplague, new variants of scaladars started emerging. It was unknown whether these were constructed by Trobriand himself, copycats, or apprentices, but they all carried the Metal Mages influence.\nShadowclaw scaladar\n Models with a composite body constructed and molded from black iron that was infused with shadowstuff that caused its claws to take on a dark color with a flickering effect. This hideous modified scaladar was a thing of nightmares. Instead of a lightning-based attack, these scaladars had a venomous sting that weakened the life force of those who encountered it.\nWinged scaladar\n Models equipped with two giant insect wings made of sheet metal and colored glass shards, giving it a more fearsome appearance. Their tails were more flexible than those of baseline scaladars, and could curl downward when in flight and strike foes underneath it.\nBy the , Trobriand started sending scaladars directly to Waterdeeps surface in order to dispose of his enemies in dark alleyways.\nIt was supposed by some sages that automatons similar to Trobriands modern scaladar were used in Myth Drannor, Netheril, and other ancient magic-boasting realms, and that some of these constructs still survived into the 14 century DR. Other sages, knowledgeable about spelljamming, suggested that the Metal Mages scaladars were derived from the smaller but frightening clockwork horrors, a theory supported by the fact that Trobriand kept a duplicate copper horror in his laboratory.\n* Squch, an \"enhanced\" scaladar that possessed increased intelligence and took upon a leadership role within the Graveyard during the 14 century DR"
