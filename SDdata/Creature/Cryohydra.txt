The cryohydra ( ) was a relative of the standard hydra that was able to breathe frost from its heads.
Cryohydras were known to inhabit the Umber Marshes in Aglarond and the arctic plains of the Hordelands.
A mated pair of cryohydras preyed on the people of Pilvers Creek, on the coast of the Moonsea, sometime in the mid-14 century DR.
