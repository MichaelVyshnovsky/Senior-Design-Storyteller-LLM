The '''cryohydra''' ({{Plural|cryohydrae|refs=}} {{Plural|cryohydras|alt=yes|refs=}}) was a relative of the standard [[hydra]] that was able to breathe frost from its heads.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Cryohydras were known to inhabit the [[Umber Marshes]] in [[Aglarond]] and the arctic plains of the [[Hordelands]].

A mated pair of cryohydras preyed on the people of [[Pilver's Creek]], on the coast of the [[Moonsea]], sometime in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite dragon/343/Rivals}}
