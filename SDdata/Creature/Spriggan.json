        "mainbody": "'''Spriggans''', also known as '''bog sprites''' in [[the Vast]], were creatures descended from [[gnome]]s warped by [[Netherese]] magic.",
        "Description": "Spriggans were said to resemble ugly gnomes in their normal form, when they were only {{SI|3|ft}} tall; when they took on their larger form they grew to {{SI|12|ft}} tall. They were thick-bodied and humanoid in form, and were variously said to have brown, black, or reddish-brown hair; some few had red hair, which they believed to be lucky. Spriggans had dull yellow skin and red eyes. They were generally unclean, with greasy hair and foul body odor. Moreover, they tended to grow out their hair to ridiculous lengths, often sporting bushy mustaches, sideburns, and ponytails.",
        "Personality": "These creatures had very dour demeanors.",
        "Abilities": "Spriggans had the unique ability to triple their size, becoming what would be considered giant for a gnome.\n\nIn addition, spriggans had an innate ability to cast the [[spell]]s ''[[affect normal fires]]'', ''[[scare]]'', and ''[[shatter]]''. Though they could not utilize other forms of magic while in their giant state.",
        "Combat": "Spriggans were often very skilled [[thieves]].",
        "History": "Some believed that spriggans originated from enslaved gnomes that had been twisted by [[fomorian]] magic, The first spriggans would not appear until much later, in the [[forest gnome]] community of the [[Forgotten Forest]] and the [[rock gnome]] community of the [[Trielta Hills]]. In later centuries, it would be said that these gnomes who became spriggans had succumbed to the [[evil]] taint of [[Urdlen]].\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1487}}, the bloodthirsty [[Clan Bigger|Bigger]] clan of Spriggans made itself known to [[Damara]], when, posing as [[dwarves]], they petitioned King [[Yarin Frostmantle]] for Damaran citizenship in exchange for [[Bloodstone]] that they had mined from their home of [[Smeltergard]] beneath the [[Galena Mountains]]. Although this petition was accepted at first, it turned out to be a ruse - the first step in a conspiracy between Clan Bigger, the [[Menzoberranzan|Menzoberranyr]] [[udadrow]] of [[House Hunzrin]], and the archfiend [[Malcanthet]] to cause chaos by having [[demon]]s possess the rulers of surface realms.<ref>",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Spriggans were typically found near isolated communities or in uninhabited areas, lairing within either nearby burrows or ruins.",
            "Relationships": "Spriggans generally only associated with their own kind. They harbored a hatred towards [[human]]s, but hated gnomes more than any other creature.",
            "Religions": "The patron deity of spriggans was Urdlen, the evil god of the [[Gnome pantheon]], and most spriggans in the Realms counted themselves as members of his cult. They both venerated and feared him, seeking to cause mayhem in his name.",
            "Usage": "The heart of a spriggan could be used as an alternative ingredient for crafting a ''[[potion of growth]]''.<ref>{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|40}}"
