'''Dragonnels''' were a species of lesser [[dragon]] that were sometimes trained as mounts.

==Description==
Dragonnels were graceful, long-legged creatures some {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall at the shoulder and {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} long from nose to tail. They had scales that ranged in color from red-brown to bright gold, and a {{SIAdj|30|ft|long=yes}} wingspan.

==Behavior==
Dragonnels were relatively simple-minded as far as dragons went, but they were loyal by nature. They were willful and playful creatures by nature, although in wild ones this meant they had a tendency to toy with their prey before killing it. In captivity, they were sometimes observed to be almost over-protective of their riders.

==Abilities==
Like other dragonkind, dragonnels possessed both [[darkvision]] and [[low-light vision]], as well as a keen sense of smell. Additionally, they could not be paralyzed or put to [[sleep]] by [[magic]]. Their sole magical ability was that, once per day, they could unleash a magic-imbued roar that could unnerve any enemies within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of them.

Dragonnels were strong fliers, easily capable of carrying up to {{SI|400|lb|k|long=yes}} while flying. On the ground, they could carry as much as {{SI|800|lb|k|long=yes}}, or even {{SI|1200|lb|k|long=yes}} with great effort. Dragonnels were variously said to be able to understand [[Draconic language|Draconic]] and/or [[Common]], but they themselves could not speak.

==Combat==
Dragonnels both wild and captive were naturally inclined to use flyby tactics. They would start off in a fight by using their roar, before fearlessly ripping and tearing with both claws and teeth.

==Ecology==
[[File:Dragonnel 5e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A dragonnel with a rider.'']]
In the wild, dragonnels lived in temperate hill regions, lairing in hidden caves. Up to four different family groups might live in a given area, sharing hunting territory and protection duties amongst the adults. Dragonnels were mature adults at only 3 years of age.

However, dragonnels were highly valuable as mounts; dragonnel eggs went for 5,000 [[gp]] on an open market, and young dragonnels were for 7,500 gp. Training even a friendly dragonnel was difficult, and fighting while riding one required a skilled rider. Dragonnels could be motivated by both food and entertainment, and captive-hatched dragonnels were observed to be both loyal and protective of their riders. However, wild-born dragonnels were significantly harder to train, and were recorded to feign compliance only long enough to throw would-be riders from great heights.

Rarely, [[paladin]]s were known to call a dragonnel as their mount instead of a horse.
