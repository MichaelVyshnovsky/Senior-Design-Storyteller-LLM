A '''beaver''' was a small common mammal.

==Description==
Beavers constructed homes from wood that they gnawed from trees. Their homes were often close to, or in, ponds.

==Combat==
They were of no threat to adventurers, as they dealt minimal damage and were not well naturally armored. Such small creatures were not particularly fast on either land or water.

==Ecology==
Beavers appeared in packs from as little as ten, to up to forty.

[[Human]]s, [[dwarves]], and others of the goodly races throughout [[Faer√ªn]], would often kill and skin beavers for their pelts. Such pelts were valued at 2 [[gp]] each.

[[Giant beaver]]s, huge and dangerous beavers, were known to exist in the [[Moonshae Isles]].
