'''Tyrantfog zombies''' were the [[zombie|risen corpses]] of priests of [[Cyric]] who died in the final phase of the [[Tyrantfog]] sent by the god [[Iyachtu Xvim]] in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.

==Description==
These shambling, rotting corpses had a dark fog leaking from their nostils and mouths. Their eyes, nails, and any exposed bone glowed with a dim, emerald-green light, a tell-tale sign of Xvim's power. 

==Behavior==
Smarter than the average zombie, Tyrantfog zombies were capable of basic and rudimentary cunning, although they were nevertheless aggressive and relentless.

==Combat==
Tyrantfog zombies showed no inclination toward self-preservation in combat, even as they employed primitive tactics. They attacked with their sharp fingernails, and an injury from them could spread the crippling disease that killed the individual during the nine days of the Tyrantfog. Inhaling the fog that seeped out of their lungs could likewise sap the endurance from anyone too close.

As [[undead]] creatures, they were immune to any [[poison]]s or [[diseases]] and were not affected by mind-affecting, paralyzing, or life-draining [[spell]]s.

==Ecology==
As undead risen by the divine power of Iyachtu Xvim, his [[Church of Iyachtu Xvim|Xvimlar]] [[cleric]]s could more easily [[turn undead|turn]], command, or rebuke these zombies. However, they did not otherwise show any respect or deference to the faithful of Xvim. 

They could be found anywhere that the Tyrantfog had struck, which included all across the [[Heartlands]], the western [[Inner Sea]] as far east as [[Tsurlagol]], the [[Moonsea]], and the [[Moonsea North]] as far as the [[Sunrise Mountains (North Faerûn)|Sunrise Mountains]], as well in [[southwest Faerûn]] between [[Mintar]] and [[Saradush]].

==History==
Between [[Mirtul 3]] and [[Mirtul 11]] of 1370 DR, a ritual enacted at [[Zhentil Keep]] by [[Fzoul Chembryl]] cased two great clouds of fog&mdash;known as the Tyrantfog&mdash;to spread across the Heartlands, casuing a debilitating disease in any [[Cyricist]] caught inside. Those who succumed to this disease subsequently rose as Tyrantfog zombies. Those who survived were incinerated on the final day of the ritual when the fog ingnited in bright green Tyrantfire.

In the years following the Tyrantfog, these risen corpses still haunted the regions where they had died.
