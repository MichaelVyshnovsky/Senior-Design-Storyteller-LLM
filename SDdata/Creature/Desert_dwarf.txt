The desert dwarves, also known as the Hairy Men of the Desert by Mazticans, were dwarves who lived in the deserts south of Kultaka and Nexal on the continent of Maztica.
Desert dwarves appeared much like other dwarves, except for darker skin.
Desert dwarves inhabited the House of Tezca desert in southern Maztica.
Desert dwarves lived in small clans of a few hundred members each. They excavated caves in the sides of canyons in order to build their villages. Unlike other dwarves, the lack of iron ore meant that they used stone tools and weapons.
During the Rockfire Cataclysm of 987 DR, Underdark passages between Maztica and Faer√ªn were destroyed, stranding a group of dwarves. After a long journey west, they emerged in the deserts of Maztica.
