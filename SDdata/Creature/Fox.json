        "Abilities": "Foxes were known for their excellent senses of hearing, smell and vision. They were very agile and were able to evade predators with ease.\n\nAs a [[familiar]] to a [[sorcerer]] or [[wizard]], foxes gained the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''[[dimension door]]'' spell three times per day. This ability functioned similar to a [[dryad]], where the fox was only able to ''dimension door'' into a bush or a tree.",

And beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], foxes could be found on the [[Brux]] layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]]."

        "History": "[[File:Reidoth-the-druid.webp|thumb|''A [[druid]] and a fox animal companion.'']]\nOne source claimed that foxes were never native to Toril, and were actually brought from [[Earth]], most likely [[Wikipedia:France|France]], by an adventurous [[halfling]] trader named [[Altho Minstrelwish]] around {{Yearlink|12}}. He had plans to sell their fur (particularly their tails, termed \"brushes\") for fashionable attire, but found few halflings were interested because of their distinct smell. Fox meat, whether roasted or stewed, was even less popular. In the end, he let the foxes run wild, and in time they displaced the native Faerûnian [[lynx]]. The [[Halfling language|hin word]] for \"fox\" was ''rennard'', after the French word for a fox, ''renard''.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2016)/Altho Minstrelwish}} However, it was known that foxes existed on Toril far before the 1{{st}} century [[DR]], even in the times of ancient [[Netheril]].<ref group=\"note\">Foxes have appeared in earlier-set sources, such as in the time of Netheril in the novel ''[[Sword Play]]'', suggesting Altho was responsible for a different breed of fox or the reintroduction of foxes.",

            "Usages": "Foxes were hunted for their pelts, which were worth between three and five [[gp]] at the market."
