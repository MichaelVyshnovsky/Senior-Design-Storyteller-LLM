==Description==
They had many curved claws running down the sides of their bodies.

==Personality==
While they did not regularly possess knowledge of known languages,{{Cite adventurers league/Into Darkness|14}} at least one skittering horror was capable of intelligent speech. It had the tendency to offer valuable information to others for its own benefit.

==Combat==
Skittering horrors could crawl along the sides of surfaces or along ceilings with ease. They attacked others with their numerous claws or giant mandibles.

These aberrations were so horrifying that their mere presence could cause onlookers to become paralyzed with fear.

==Notable Skittering Horrors==
* [[Shadow in the Ice]], one horror that served as the herald of [[Father Llymic]]. It was summoned into [[Xorvintroth]] from the Far Realm{{Cite adventurers league/Frozen Whispers|2}} and became encased in ice after the city was transported to the frozen wastes in the [[Spine of the World]].
