Similar to ghouls in all other respects, they were distinguished by their natural ability to swim as well as they could walk.",
        "Abilities": "Lacedons were surprisingly adept at climbing.\n\nLike ordinary ghouls, the bite of a lacedon could transmit [[ghoul fever]],",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Lacedons often lurked near reefs and rocky shores, places where ships and living creatures were likely to pass by. When not on land they were in water, usually prowling near unseen reefs and other dangerous locations where boats and ships were at risk of sinking.\n\nIn the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] they were rarely found in [[Serôs]], but were more prevalent in the shallows of the [[Whamite Isles]] and the [[Haunted Plains]]. In the [[Moonshae Isles]] they could occasionally be found in the land's rivers or lakes.\n\nOutside of the [[Prime Material plane]], lacedons could be found in [[Draga Salt-Biter]]'s domain of [[Saragoss]] in the [[Domains of Dread]].",
            "Relationships": "Some evil aquatic creatures were known to deliberately create lacedons through rituals. These included [[aboleth]]s, [[bog hag]]s, [[kuo-toa]]s, and [[sahuagin]]s.",
            "Variations": "A stronger type known as the \"deep lacedon\", analogous to an aquatic [[ghast]], could be found in the vicinity of the ''[[Breaker of Waves]]'' shipwreck off the shores of [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. When encountered underwater, these undead creatures were enveloped in clouds of poisonous [[algae]], and attacked with their claw rakes and vicious bites."
        },
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], an evil wizard, [[Flattery Wyvernspur]], sent some of the lacedons under his control to assassinate [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] before he could see old Selunite adventurer  [[Lleddew]]. The aging cleric was a [[werebear]] and aided the young nobleman in slaying the vicious undead within the waters holy to [[Selûne]].\n\nDuring the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] in [[1369 DR]], lacedon were among the many creatures in [[Iakhovas]]'s army.\n\nIn [[1375 DR]], during an [[undead]] army's assault upon [[Thay]], lacedons were seen traveling along the rivers of the [[Sunrise Mountains]].\n\n[[Arklem Greeth]], a [[lich]] who long ruled in the [[Host Tower of the Arcane|Host Tower]] of [[Luskan]], commanded a group of lacedon to ambush a fleet of supply ships from [[Waterdeep]] ''en route'' to the war-torn city of Luskan. Greeth used the lacedon to intercept the supply ship caravan in order to keep the people of Luskan hungry and desperate in retaliation for Captain [[Deudermont]] driving him from the city.<ref>"
