Massospondylus, also known as massopondylus (), was a species of dinosaur.
Massospondylus had long teeth that were very sharp. They also had long, sharp claws on their five-fingered hands, with a large spike at the end of their thumb.
Massospondylus were known for not being very intelligent. 
Massospondylus used their sharp teeth as a defensive weapon, biting quickly before making their escape. They were among the favored prey of several carnosaurs such as allosaurus, deinonychus and tyrannosaurus.
Massospondylus were herbivores and lived in herds. Similar to some avian species, they consumed stones which aided their digestion of vegetation.
