A '''jubbrawuk''' was a type of [[dragon]] of fantastical appearance and a long neck. The name "jubbrawuk" was used by some [[sage]]s.

Statues of jubbrawuks were among the statues of [[gargoyle]]s, [[gremlin]]s, [[satyr]]s, and [[wyvern]]s that adorned [[Oldstone Hall]] and its walls, in [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note">The name "jubbrawuk" likely comes from the poem [[Wikipedia:Jabberwocky|"Jabberwocky"]]. As it appears among actual [[Wikipedia:Gargoyle|gargoyles]] and derives from a nonsense poem, it is possible that the jubbrawuk is a fictional monster within the Forgotten Realms.
