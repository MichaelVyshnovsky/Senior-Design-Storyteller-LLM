Durzagons were the half-fiend offspring of devils and duergar.
Slightly taller and leaner than average duergar, durzagon stood about  tall. They were usually bald with a wiry, gray, red-streaked beard and rust-colored skin that radiated noticeable levels of heat. They had razor-sharp claws and teeth strong enough to pierce skin.
Not every durzagon was aware of their infernal heritage since devils normally kept their true identity secret from their duergar mates. Durzagons made aware of their origin typically kept such knowledge secret from enemies and allies alike.
Durzagons possessed both the natural abilities of duergar and magical powers granted from their fiendish heritage. They could create darkness three times per day, enlarge themselves, and turn invisible. A durzagons beard held quills that contained a sulfuric poison that physically weakened foes. Despite their duergar traits, durzagons truly were outsiders and could not be resurrected.
While they typically cast spells from behind their duergar bodyguards, durzagons thoroughly enjoyed melee combat and when physically engaged with an opponent they would fearlessly fight to the death.
Durzagon tended to be revered by their peers as powerful leaders and their birth was celebrated in the Nine Hells. They were almost always found ruling their respective societies and larger duergar cities could have several durzagons within it. 
Despite being fiends, most durzagons still worshiped Laduguer. 
Durzagon were among the forces of the duergar city of Gracklstugh during the duergar attack on Menzoberranzan in 1372 DR.
