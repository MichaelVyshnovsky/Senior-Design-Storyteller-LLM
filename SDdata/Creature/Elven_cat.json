        "mainbody": "An elven cat or elfin cat was a feline from a race bred by elves, infused with magic through generations of close contact with their sorcery.\nMost elven cats had dark-striped fur of gray brown. They were sometimes mistaken for lynxes or wild cats.\nElven cats were very intelligent, with many of them conversant in rudimentary elven language alongside their own. Some had instead attached themselves to families of halflings or gnomes and spoke these languages instead, or even the tongue of brownies or other sylvan languages.\nThey also enjoyed swimming, unlike many other small cats.\nAn elven cat could leap up to , and it always acted as if under pass without trace. They possessed a number of spells, including a limited form of detect thoughts, and enlarge or trip once daily. They could also cast reduce or tree shape twice daily. These cats were far more stealthy than normal cats.\nElven cats employed their spells in combat, and were far more effective about their claws and teeth than regular cats.\nElven cats wandered the encircling wood of Myth Drannor, between Shadowdale and Mistledale. They were companions to some elves, and formed part of the composition of some small armies.\nWhiskers from elven cats were used as the material component of the cats grace spell, then uncommon, in . They could be summoned by the spell summon cats and by find minion.\nSuch cats descended from wild cats, changed by close contact with elven magic over generations. It was suspected some of that magic was intentional\nElven cats served some members of the Seldarine pantheon, including Corellon Larethian, Erevan Ilesere, Hanali Celanil, Rilifane Ratathil, and Solonor Thelondira. Sharess could show her pleasure through manifestations of elven cats. The Cat Lord was followed by some cats in the Beastlands.\nGeneral Briandon Lamachia Obespieri of Ravens Bluff owned an elven cat."
