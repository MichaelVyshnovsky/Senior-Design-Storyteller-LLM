        "mainbody": "An '''elven cat''' or '''elfin cat''' was a feline from a race bred by [[elves]], infused with magic through generations of close contact with their sorcery.",
        "Description": "Most elven cats had dark-striped fur of gray brown. They were sometimes mistaken for [[lynx]]es or wild cats.",
        "Behavior": "Elven cats were very intelligent, with many of them conversant in rudimentary [[elven language]] alongside their own. Some had instead attached themselves to families of [[halfling]]s or [[gnome]]s and spoke these languages instead, or even the tongue of [[brownie]]s or other sylvan languages.\n\nThey also enjoyed swimming, unlike many other small cats.",
        "Abilities": "An elven cat could leap up to {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}}, and it always acted as if under ''[[pass without trace]]''. They possessed a number of [[spell]]s, including a limited form of ''[[detect thoughts]]'', and ''[[enlarge]]'' or ''[[trip]]'' once daily. They could also cast ''[[reduce]]'' or ''[[tree shape]]'' twice daily. These cats were far more stealthy than normal cats.",
        "Combat": "Elven cats employed their spells in combat, and were far more effective about their claws and teeth than regular cats.",
        "Ecology": "Elven cats wandered the encircling wood of [[Myth Drannor]], between [[Shadowdale]] and [[Mistledale]]. They were companions to some elves, and formed part of the composition of some small armies.{{cite dragon/115/Elven Armies and Dwarves-at-Arms|58}}\n\nWhiskers from elven cats were used as the [[material component]] of the ''[[cat's grace]]'' spell, then uncommon, in {{yearlink|1367}}.{{cite book/Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume One|124}} They could be summoned by the spell ''[[summon cats]]''{{cite book/Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four|891}} and by ''[[find minion]]''.{{Cite dragon/228/Greater Familiars of Faer√ªn|81}}",
        "History": "Such cats descended from wild cats, changed by close contact with elven magic over generations. It was suspected some of that magic was intentional;{{cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 5}}\n\nElven cats served some members of the [[Seldarine pantheon]], including [[Corellon Larethian]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|101}} [[Erevan Ilesere]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|109}} [[Hanali Celanil]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|115}} [[Rilifane Ratathil]],{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|122}} and [[Solonor Thelondira]].{{cite book/Demihuman Deities|133}} [[Sharess]] could show her pleasure through manifestations of elven cats. The [[Cat Lord]] was followed by some cats in the [[Beastlands]].{{cite book/Planes of Conflict/Liber Benevolentiae|24}}",
