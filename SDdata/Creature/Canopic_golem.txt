Canopic golems were large crystalline constructs created in part from the organs of living individuals. Several canopic golems were created by the mummy lord Valin Sarnaster, famed oracle of Savras from the House of the All-Seeing Orb in Tashluta.
Canopic golems were tall imposing figures that stared out with eyes the color of amber.
The only recorded means of creating canopic golems were outlined in the tome entitled The Canopic Being. It involved the removal of a vital organ from a persons body, keeping it within a canopic jar,
Like other constructs, canopic golems did not need food or water for sustenance, required no sleep nor air to breathe, and never succumbed to exhaustion. They could not be poisoned, paralyzed, or turned to stone, and were immune to both fear and charm effects, whether mundane or magical in nature.
While canopic golems had no means of independent verbal communication, they could be used as vessels by their creators. Their masters could see through their eyes and speak through their mouths as they pleased.
Canopic golems attacked by using their massive fists or crystalline darts imbued with force energy.
They could resist the effects of all but the most-powerful spells and could even redirect spells cast upon them towards other targets.
In the late 15 century DR, Valin Sarnaster received visions of a number of individuals from across the Realms and manipulated them into seeking out her guidance in Tashluta. Once they presented themselves, Valin performed the dark rituals detailed within The Canopic Being and transformed them into canopic golems. They remained trapped in eternal service to the seer of Savras, being stationed as guardians within her tomb in Tashluta.
