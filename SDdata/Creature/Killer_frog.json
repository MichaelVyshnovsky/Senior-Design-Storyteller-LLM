        "mainbody": "'''Killer frogs''' were a very rare species of [[giant frog]], that long ago were specially bred to be cannibals.",
        "Description": "These creatures were smaller than many other species of giant frog, growing to be {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} in length. They also uniquely had talons on their front feet and mouths lined with sharp teeth.",
        "Behavior": "Killer frogs were known to be quite vicious.",
        "Combat": "Unlike other species of giant frog, these creatures did not attempt to swallow their prey whole.",
        "History": "Some time in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[goblin]] tribe [[Teerac-on-Water]] trained killer frogs to act as guardians around the perimeter of their island lair.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Killer frogs were predatory carnivores who preferred the taste of [[human]] flesh above all else.",
            "Habitats": "Killer frogs could be found a wide variety of habitats, so long as they had fresh water. Like most species of frog they typically lived in marshes, swamps, lakes, river banks, large ponds, or lakes.\n\nIn [[Cormanthor]] they could potentially be found in [[Elvenflow]], [[Lake Sember]], the [[River Ashaba]], and other bodies of water. They could also be found in the tropical waters of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], killer frogs could be found in the [[Outlands]] in the marsh that surrounded the [[gate-town]] of [[Torch (gate-town)|Torch]]."
