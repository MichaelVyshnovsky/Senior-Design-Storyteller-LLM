        "Description": "Wood woads appeared to be humanoid in shape, of heavy and muscular build, but were covered in thick bark with a crown of stubby branches on the head and small, deep-set black eyes. Their \"hands\" were gnarled branches and their \"feet\" were masses of black roots.",
        "Behavior": "Wood woads were usually interested only in carrying out their assigned duty, but some became fierce guardians of their resident forests and sought vengeance for each tree slain by axes.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Ritual Creation": "The ritual that created a wood woad consisted of removing the heart of a living person, planting a seed into it and placing it inside a cavity in a tree. The sacrificed creature's body was buried in the vicinity, and the tree was then bathed with the sacrifice's blood. After three days, a wood woad would sprout from the ground nearby, ready to receive its orders, which it would then follow forever or until otherwise relieved. If such ritual-created wood woads were released from their duties, they would find a new place or persons to protect."
