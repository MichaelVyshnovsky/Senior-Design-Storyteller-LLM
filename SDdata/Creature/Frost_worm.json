        "mainbody": "'''Frost worms''' were massive, worm-like creatures that terrorized wintery environments.",
        "Description": "The average frost worm was about {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} long and {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} in diameter, and weighed about {{SI|8000|pounds|k|long=yes}}, however some specimens could grow to truly gargantuan proportions. Their skin was a very pale blue, and their heads were marked by huge mandibles and a nodule from which they emitted a trilling noise.",
        "Abilities": "A frost worm's signature trill was used to stun its prey. This acted as a sonically-induced compulsion to stand still for as long as the trilling noise was audible, thus making an affected creature into an easy target. The trill was effective at up to {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}}, and even being attacked by the worm or violently shaken to their senses only sometimes allowed a victim to snap out of their trance.\n\nMerely touching a frost worm could be injurious as their bodies generated an intense chill, which meant that any attack from a frost worm was especially dangerous. They could also weaponize their natural cold by expelling it as a breath attack that could reach targets up to {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} away. Furthermore, a slain frost worm's body instantly froze into ice before shattering in a mighty explosion that threatened to freeze and shred everything within a {{SIAdj|100|foot|long=yes}} radius.",
        "Behavior": "A frost worm waited for prey while hidden in snow banks. When a target got close, the worm would stun it with a trill and then attack the immobile target with its breath attack or with a powerful bite of its mandibled jaws.\n\nThey hated [[fire]], and were afraid of it.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Frost worms could be found in cold regions and mountains, including the [[Galena Mountains]] in the [[Cold Lands]] They could even be found outside the [[Material Plane]] in the [[Frostfell (plane)|Elemental Plane of Cold]], the [[Iron Wastes]] of the [[Abyss]], and an [[air elemental]] variant of the frost worm could be found in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].",
            "Uses": "It was possible to capture and train young frost worms. Some arctic tribal communities trained them as protectors or mounts, although riding a frost worm required a [[magical]]ly cold-resistant [[saddle]].\n\nTanned frost worm hide could be made into a dazzling white-colored [[leather]]."
        },
        "Notable": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, a frost worm had claimed the western side of the ruined city of [[Skelem]] as its feeding grounds."
