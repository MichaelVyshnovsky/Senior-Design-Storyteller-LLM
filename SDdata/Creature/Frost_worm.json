        "mainbody": "Frost worms were massive, worm-like creatures that terrorized wintery environments.\nThe average frost worm was about  long and  in diameter, and weighed about , however some specimens could grow to truly gargantuan proportions. Their skin was a very pale blue, and their heads were marked by huge mandibles and a nodule from which they emitted a trilling noise.\nA frost worms signature trill was used to stun its prey. This acted as a sonically-induced compulsion to stand still for as long as the trilling noise was audible, thus making an affected creature into an easy target. The trill was effective at up to , and even being attacked by the worm or violently shaken to their senses only sometimes allowed a victim to snap out of their trance.\nMerely touching a frost worm could be injurious as their bodies generated an intense chill, which meant that any attack from a frost worm was especially dangerous. They could also weaponize their natural cold by expelling it as a breath attack that could reach targets up to  away. Furthermore, a slain frost worms body instantly froze into ice before shattering in a mighty explosion that threatened to freeze and shred everything within a  radius.\nA frost worm waited for prey while hidden in snow banks. When a target got close, the worm would stun it with a trill and then attack the immobile target with its breath attack or with a powerful bite of its mandibled jaws.\nThey hated fire, and were afraid of it.\nFrost worms were well-adapted to their native arctic environs as they were both impervious to the cold and excellent at camouflaging with snow.\nIn general, a frost worm only came to the surface to hunt or attack their prey. They hunted mammoths, moose, polar bears, seals, walruses, yaks, and the occasional humanoid or giant. They preferred to attack smaller groups, usually of no more than six individuals.\nFrost worm eggs were easy to mistake for chunks of oval-shaped ice. They lived and hunted alone from the moment they hatched, and grew to maturity in three to five years.\nSome sages argued that frost worms were related to purple worms and/or to remorhazes. Regardless of the truth, frost worms were known to attack remorhazes on sight, even though a remorhaz was usually the victor in such battles. These fights could turn into titanic clashes that devastated the surrounding area.\nFrost worms could be found in cold regions and mountains, including the Galena Mountains in the Cold Lands They could even be found outside the Material Plane in the Elemental Plane of Cold, the Iron Wastes of the Abyss, and an air elemental variant of the frost worm could be found in the Elemental Plane of Air.\nIt was possible to capture and train young frost worms. Some arctic tribal communities trained them as protectors or mounts, although riding a frost worm required a magically cold-resistant saddle.\nTanned frost worm hide could be made into a dazzling white-colored leather.\nAs of the , a frost worm had claimed the western side of the ruined city of Skelem as its feeding grounds."
