        "mainbody": "'''Desert centaurs''' were nomads inhabiting the vast deserts of [[Zakhara]].\n\nThey often executed raids on bandit camps, using their speed and savage skills to their advantage. Desert centaurs were known to zealously protect their lands.",
        "Description": "These creatures were smaller than [[Centaur|their cousins]] found elsewhere on [[Toril]] but they also had longer, thinner legs of an [[antelope]].\n\nMales grew long beards and females wore veils and beautiful clothes. While traveling they carried their belongings in small bags.",
        "Abilities": "Desert centaurs had excellent vision that allowed them to orientate themselves perfectly in the dark. On a moonlit night they could easily see as far away as {{SI|200|yards|long=yes}}.",
        "Combat": "Desert centaurs preferred to use [[spear]]s, [[bow]]s and [[scimitar]]s. In close combat, they could also attack with their hooves. Ranged weapons were their favorite since they avoided close combat if possible. They often used tactics typical of desert nomads, luring the enemy into an ambush and striking, then dissolving into the desert. If the opponent withstood the initial attack, the ambush was repeated.",
        "Society": {
            "Relationships": "Along their travels desert centaurs often encountered native human tribes. When required they could attack or conclude a peace treaty with them. Desert centaurs also held a great disdain for [[genie]]s."
