        "mainbody": "A dimetrodon (), also known as sailback by the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau, was a species of ancient carnivorous reptile which lived alongside various dinosaurs.\nThese creatures bore some resemblance to alligators and were even said to produce a snarl similar to that of an alligator. The most distinctive feature on a dimetrodons body was the [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_spine_sail neural spine sail] that spanned the length of their back.\nDimetrodons typically hunted in shallow waters or shores, much like crocodiles, and spent much of their time sunning atop rocks near these waters. They were generally considered to be highly territorial.\nThese creatures were very unlikely to ever attack with clears, instead utilizing their powerful jaws against prey.\n* Mountain Thunder, a racing dimetrodon from Port Nyanzaru.\n* The dwarf Kyer Wyrmheart was known to keep pet dimetrodons.\nDimetrodons were common to areas where other dinosaurs lived,"
