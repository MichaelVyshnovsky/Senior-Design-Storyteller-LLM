Water constrictors were a species of constrictor snake that could be found in the waters of Icewind Dale.
These serpents were monstrously long.
A water constrictor attacked by, as its name would suggest, constricting its opponent with a force strong enough to bring down even a verbeeg.
In the aftermath of Drizzt DoUrden and Wulfgars attack on Biggrins secret base in Kelvins Cairn in 1356 DR, a fleeing verbeeg was led into a mountain pool by Guenhwyvar, where the giant was attacked and drowned by a water constrictor lying in wait.
