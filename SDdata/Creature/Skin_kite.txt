A '''skin kite''' is an animated slice of skin that is constantly in danger of rotting away.

==Description==
No two skin kites look identical, as their bodies are made of the skin type and color of their recent prey. It is not uncommon for skin kites to have random clumps of hair, furthering their gruesome appearance. Normally, skin kite weigh {{SI|5|lb|long=yes}} and have a wingspan of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}.

==Combat==
Like dead leaves, they fall from the sky on their victims, where they "meld" with their prey's skin, tearing off a section and absorbing it. In this way they replenish their rotting bodies long enough to find more victims.
