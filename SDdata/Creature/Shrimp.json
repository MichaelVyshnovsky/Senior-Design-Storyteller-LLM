In [[1367 DR]], a sage in [[Thunderstone]] received from an explorer a deceased giant golden carp from [[Scalewater]], a pond south of the [[Thunder Peaks]], identified the gill rot disease, and feared that a [[red dragon]] who guarded the pond would retaliate against nearby villages unless it was treated with the popper-shrimp antidote."
