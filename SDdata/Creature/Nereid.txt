'''Nereids''' were a race of [[aquatic]] [[fey]] related to the [[triton]]s. Like the [[nymph]]s who lived in the coves and streams, the [[dryad]]s who lived in the trees, and the [[oread]]s who dwelt in the mountains, nereids were fey who were bound to the seas and oceans. They physically resembled tritons except that their bodies displaced light, making them nearly transparent and hard to see, especially when they were in the water.

==History==
In [[1361 DR]], a nereid ensnared [[Fyodor]] on [[Ruathym]] and almost drowned him. However, [[Liriel Baenre]] rescued him by snatching the nereid's shawl and enslaving her.

==Society==
===Homelands===
Evil nereids roamed the streets of the underwater city of [[Ascale]]. They also lived in and defended [[Lake Ashane]] in [[Rashemen]].

Nereids were also rumored to live within the forest of [[Shilmista]], within a pool formed from the headwaters of the [[River Valashar]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], nereids could be found in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] and in [[Oceanus]].<ref>

===Relationships===
Nereids that lived in the region of [[Zakhara]] were known to domesticate and keep [[sea wyrm]]s as pets. In other regions, nereids often kept [[giant otter]]s as pets.

Some acted as servants of the [[marid]] [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] in her [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].

==Notable nereids==
*[[Ghaliyah]], a nereid in [[Hawa]] who was enslaved by a cult of [[Istishia]] worshipers in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}
*[[Shoal]]
