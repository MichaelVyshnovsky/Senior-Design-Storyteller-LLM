A '''kolyarut''' was one of the [[inevitable]]s whose purpose was to enforce the inevitability of punishment for breaking an oath or contract.

==Description==
A kolyarut resembled a mechanical humanoid, wearing elaborate golden-hued banded-mail armor and a flowing red robe, and wielding a shining sword.This is based on the original description from ''Manual of the Planes'', matching the artwork. The 3.5-edition ''Monster Manual'' instead says it has a golden robe and red skin, despite not having skin at all. Its voice was flat and like the sound of a clockwork mechanism.

==Activities==
These inevitables hunted down those who had broken their vows or agreements. They cared little for people who broke their word inadvertently or unwillingly, and typically overlooked minor deals and hastily made vows. Rather, they were dispatched to avenge significant betrayals, but afterward, while still on the [[Material Plane]], they would pursue anyone who caught their attention willingly reneging on an oath, such as deserting soldiers and dishonest merchants.

On starting a mission, a kolyarut did its research, learning all it could about the contract or vow and those making it. If a written contract or oath was involved, it often took a copy with it for reference when hunting its target. They would study their target, getting a good understanding of their capabilities before engaging in battle. They would even go undercover with the aid of their ''disguise self'' spell if need be. They worked alone.

==Personality==
Kolyaruts were more garrulous than other inevitables, even making appropriate greetings and displaying good manners in a convincing way before getting straight to business.

==Society==
A great inevitable known only as the Kolyarut stood in the Hall of Concordance in [[Sigil]], the City of Doors, and oversaw contracts made there, taking payment in [[gold]]. It was describe as a machine of absolute jurisprudence. While it refused any contract that was ambiguous, conflicting, or unenforceable, it otherwise didn't care if the parties involved truly understood it. Accepted contracts were inscribed in sheets of gold and locked within the chest a [[marut]] inevitable bound to enforce its terms and punish violators.

==Possessions==
They were armed with ''+2 [[longsword]]s''.

==Abilities==
In addition to the common powers of inevitables, they had the power to drain the life force of their targets and heal themselves as with a ''[[vampiric touch]]'' spell and could shoot a black ray that sapped it altogether as with ''[[enervation]]''. They could also have magic similar to the spells ''[[discern lies]]'', ''[[disguise self]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[locate creature]]'', and ''[[suggestion]]'' as often as it wished; ''[[hold monster]]'' and ''[[mark of justice]]'' once a day each; and even a ''[[geas/quest]]'' once a week. They were also skilled in information gathering, sensing deceit, and adopting disguises.

==Tactics==
A kolyarut preferred to use its ''disguise self'' or ''invisibility'' to get close to a target and make a surprise attack using its ''vampiric touch''. It would not hesitate to use this on any allies to empower itself if necessary to achieve its goal. While it tried to finish a fight quickly and limit injury and chaos, it was less worried about the safety of innocent beings.

==History==
The inevitables were created by [[Mystra]], as she was guardian of the laws of [[magic]] and they were tasked with enforcing the fundamental laws of the universe. However, others reported [[Primus]], ruler of Mechanus and the [[modron]]s, was responsible for the inevitables.

==Locations==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], kolyaruts and other inevitables could normally be found on their home plane of the [[Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus]], as well as the similarly lawful planes of the [[Nine Hells]] and [[Mount Celestia]].<ref> However, they could appear anywhere when in pursuit of their quarry.

In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the inevitables were found in [[Dweomerheart]], the realm of Mystra.

A great priest or mage could specifically summon a kolyarut via a ''[[call kolyarut]]'' spell, but only for a task in line with its duty.<ref>
