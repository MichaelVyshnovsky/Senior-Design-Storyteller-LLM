Often mistaken for half-celestials, these creatures were not nearly so powerful and did not share a bloodline with any of the true celestials. \nMany celestial creatures were to celestials as animals were to humans of the Material Plane.\nCelestial creatures appeared much like their counterparts on the Prime, except that they often had visible signs of the holy realms where they dwelt, often in the form of gold, silver, or platinum coloration. while stags in the divine realm of Labelas Enoreth wore coats of white. They were generally more attractive and noble of appearance than their non-celestial cousins.\nOutside their majestic appearances, celestial creatures were in most ways similar to the prime creatures that they resembled, but there were a few significant differences. All celestial creatures were sentient with at least minimal intelligence. A celestial mouse would be more intelligent than any mouse native to Toril.\nAll celestial creatures had the ability to see in the dark and were resistant to harm from acid, cold, electricity, spells, and often to attacks from mundane weapons.\nAn attack from a celestial creature had the supernatural power to cause more harm to creatures that were evil.\nAll celestial creatures were good like the planes on which they dwelt.\nThere were a plethora of creatures living on all of the Upper Planes that were similar to ones from Toril yet had adapted to those good worlds.

This was especially true in the House of Nature, where that planes humanoid petitioners slowly took on animalistic traits until they at last fully morphed into celestial animals. Some sages claimed that the same was true for the celestial animals living in the Beastlands.\nOver the centuries, both divine and arcane spellcasters had learned the power to summon many varieties of celestial creatures from their home planes for temporary aid. Common among these were celestial badgers, bears, bison, dogs, dolphins, eagles and giant eagles, elephants, giant bees, giant beetles, griffons and hippogriffs, lions, monkeys, owls and giant owls, rocs, sea cats, triceratops, and whales. In the case of divine magic, these creatures were most often servants of the deific power worshiped by the summoning cleric.\nThe spell vipergout summoned celestial vipers. The elven high magic spell celestial army could be used to summon a single celestial lammasu. The pegasus helm of Kloeth Ironstar was a magical helmet that could summon a celestial pegasus.\nThe Keepers were a group of celestial halflings in service to Arvoreen.\nCelestial chargers were celestial unicorns who inhabited Mielikkis Grove of the Unicorns."
