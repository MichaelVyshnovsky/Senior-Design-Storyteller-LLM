        "mainbody": "Stone wolves were a type of stone construct.\nThese constructs varied in appearance along a general wolf theme, though they always had white-hot fire opals for eyes.\nThese constructs had a degree of intellect comparable to that of an animal.\nStone wolves were immune to charm, hold, and sleep spells as well as those based around cold or paralysis. Spells based around fire or electricity had the potential to harm them, but it was low. Due to being made of stone, blunt weaponry was more harmful to them than edged weaponry.\nThe spell stone to flesh made them vulnerable to all sorts of weaponry, while the spells disintegrate and transmute rock to mud had the potential to outright kill them. Move earth could be used to transform them into inanimate statues. Alternatively, a stone wolf could be destroyed by smashing both of its fire opal eyes.\nIf necessary, a stone wolf was capable of tracking creatures through hearing and sight. They could not track by smell.\nThese constructs fought in a similar manner to their namesake. They typically stood still until an enemy approached them.\nStone wolves were constructed by mages, typically in batches of four. They began with lumps of purified clay with two fire opals and the skull of a wolf embedded in them. The mage would cast a specially modified version of the spell stone shape on the clay, followed by a specially modified version of animate dead the next day. During the period between those two castings, the mage could not cast any other spells.\nStones wolves acted as servants of the duergar deities Deep Duerra and Laduguer, as well as the halfling deity of earth Urogalan."
