            "Construction": "Stone wolves were constructed by [[mage]]s, typically in batches of four. They began with lumps of purified clay with two fire opals and the skull of a wolf embedded in them. The mage would cast a specially modified version of the spell ''[[stone shape]]'' on the clay, followed by a specially modified version of ''[[animate dead]]'' the next day. During the period between those two castings, the mage could not cast any other spells.",
            "Relationships": "Stones wolves acted as [[favored monster|servants]] of the [[duergar]] [[deities]] [[Deep Duerra]] and [[Laduguer]], as well as the [[halfling]] deity of [[earth (element)|earth]] [[Urogalan]]."
