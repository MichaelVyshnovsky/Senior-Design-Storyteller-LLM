        "mainbody": "'''T'ien lung''', also known as '''celestial dragons''', were [[dragon]]s that were found in the mountains of [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "T'ien lungs were physically distinguished by their long, serpentine body and enormous size, up to 155 feet (47 meters) in length. They were born with dull gold scales but as they grew older the scales changed to a bright radiant yellow. Their scales gave off a sweet aroma, similar to cherry blossoms. Some t'ien lung had light green or orange scales. They had polychromatic beards, manes and whiskers. Their whiskers were long and rose over their heads like horns.",
        "Personality": "T'ien lungs tended to be smug and arrogant. Despite this they were noble and honorable. [[Pan lung]] resented and were fiercely jealous of t'ien lung and would sometimes attack one unprovoked in a jealous rage.",
        "Abilities": "A t'ien lung had innate magical abilities, each gained as they grew older. They could use ''[[control weather]]'' several times a day, the frequency of which increased as they aged. Three times per day a mature t'ien lung could use ''[[pyrotechnics]]'' and ''[[suggestion]]''. Once per day a mature t'ien lung could use ''[[fire storm]]''{{T'ienlungNote}}, ''[[meteor swarm]]'', and ''[[sunburst]]''.",
        "Ecology": "A t'ien lung lacked wings, but was able to fly due to a magical yellow [[pearl]] embedded in their brains, this pearl was similar to that on a [[shen lung]]. If found on a dead t'ien lung or removed from a live one, this pearl was worth 1,000[[gp]] yet did not retain its magical abilities. At birth they could immediately breathe both water and air. T'ien lung made their home in palaces found in clouds and on the peaks of mountains. A t'ien lungs diet consisted of [[opal]] and [[pearl]]. T'ien lungs lived a solitary life, mates never lived with each other and a mother t'ien lung would banish her offspring as soon as they were old enough to fend for themselves. Older t'ien lung usually had several [[air elemental]] who acted as their servants or bodyguards. These elementals were fiercely loyal to the dragon and obeyed their commands unconditionally.",
        "Celestial Bureaucracy": "Within the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], t'ien lung were in charge of controlling the weather except rain. They had a reputation of being the most favorite of all the officials in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], a reputation they did little to discourage."
