        "mainbody": "Pentaceratops () was a species of dinosaur living in Faer√ªn.\nPentaceratops looked like their cousins monoclonius and triceratops. They had three horns and a large bony head crest. They were called pentaceratops, or \"five-horned face\" due to the erroneous impression they had five horns. The two \"horns\" on either side of its head were in fact large cheek bones.\nPentaceratops were known for being aggressive.\nThe pentaceratops was well defended against large predators. Its horns made effective weapons and its head crest protected most of its body from a forward attack. It was large enough to simply crush smaller predators with its body.\nPentaceratops were herbivores and lived in herds."
