'''Gilded imps''' were a variety of [[imp]]s from the [[Nine Hells]] specially blessed by the [[archdevil]] [[Mammon]].

==Description==
Gilded imps resembled the regular variety, but had a second skin of gold.

==Behavior==
Mammon's golden blessing enhanced the charisma of gilded imps.

==Abilities==
The golden plating of gilded imps made them much tougher and difficult to hurt than normal imps. Their stingers could also inflict a condition known as "Mammon's Hold," which temporarily turned their victims into golden statues.
