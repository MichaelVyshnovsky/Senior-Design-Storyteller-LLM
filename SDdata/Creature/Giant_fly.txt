'''Giant flies''' were monstrous varieties of the mundane order of insects known as flies.

==Behavior==
All species of giant fly were highly fearful of [[fire]] and instinctively avoided it at all cost, as it could easily destroy their wings.

==Combat==
Giant flies would land upon their prey and bite at their bodies. When engaging an aggressively defensive foe, giant flies tended to jump {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} backwards to escape combat.

==Species==
;Bluebottle
:A monstrous variety of the mundane [[bluebottle fly]]. They rarely attacked living creatures, unless they had open wounds or were covered in blood. This is because they preferred eating things such as carrion and offal. They were also known to be attracted to sweet odors. Those bitten by giant bluebottle flies had a low chance of contracting some form of [[disease]].
;Horsefly
:A monstrous variety of the mundane horsefly, these were the largest species of giant fly. Highly aggressive, they were willing to attack nearly any creature. They had a tuberous mouth from which they drew blood from others.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Giant flies were primarily known to inhabit the jungles of [[Chult]].

Giant horseflies were known to inhabit the [[Cormanthor#Rimwood|rimwood forest]] of [[Cormanthyr]], as well as the plains of [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], and [[Sembia]]. In [[Thay]], they could be found in [[Delhumide (tharch)|Delhumide]] and [[Priador]].<ref> And beyond [[Toril]], they could be found on the planet [[Karpri]].

In [[Interior Faer√ªn]], both giant horseflies and bluebottle flies could be found in the jungle within the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]].

==Trivia==
* The ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]'' known as the "ebon fly" was carved in the likeness of a horsefly. When activated it transformed into a giant fly that could be ridden as a [[mount]].
* [[Myshik Morueme]] was skilled in riding giant flies as mounts.
