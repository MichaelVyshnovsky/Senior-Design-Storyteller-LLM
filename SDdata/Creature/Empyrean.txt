Empyreans were the children of deities from the Upper Planes.
Empyreans were the universal manifestation of beauty. They had a statuesque appearance and never aged.
Creatures of strong emotions, empyreans were capable of altering their surroundings according to their moods. The environment around an empyrean physically manifested the empyreans emotions. Wilting flowers, salt-water rains, even dying animals and trees might reflect an empyreans negative emotions, while radiant sunlight, bird song, and playful small animals would manifest around a happy empyrean.
As children of the Upper Planes, most empyreans were usually benevolent creatures. However, if an empyrean became corrupted by the Lower Planes or suffered a curse from an evil deity and turned to evil, it could no longer live in its home plane and had to retreat to the Prime Material plane.
As un-aging creatures of immense powers, empyreans did not contemplate their own mortality and recklessly charged into battle even if at the brink of being slain. They could do devastating earth-shaking damage with their weapons and bolts of pure energy, and could considerably bolster their allies, amplifying their abilities and resistance to magic effects. Empyreans could also innately cast a number of spells, such as commune, dispel evil and good, earthquake, fire storm, greater restoration, pass without trace, plane shift, water breathing, and water walk.
An empyrean who was slain in battle was typically resurrected by one of its parents in its home plane. The only exception was when the empyreans parents had a reason not to revive their child.
Nalkara was the empyrean daughter of Auril and Thrym. She owed a favor to Halaster Blackcloak in the late 15 century DR.
Uldrak was a servant of the god Surtur who quested to the Nine Hells to slay Tiamat for his deity. Instead of killing the goddess however, he was instead transformed into a Spinagon.
