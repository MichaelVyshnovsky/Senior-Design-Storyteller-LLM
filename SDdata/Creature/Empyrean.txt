'''Empyreans''' were the children of [[Deity|deities]] from the [[Upper Planes]].

==Description==
Empyreans were the universal manifestation of beauty. They had a statuesque appearance and never aged.

==Personality==
Creatures of strong emotions, empyreans were capable of altering their surroundings according to their moods. The environment around an empyrean physically manifested the empyrean's emotions. Wilting flowers, salt-water rains, even dying animals and trees might reflect an empyrean's negative emotions, while radiant sunlight, bird song, and playful small animals would manifest around a happy empyrean.

As children of the Upper Planes, most empyreans were usually benevolent creatures. However, if an empyrean became corrupted by the [[Lower Planes]] or suffered a curse from an [[evil]] deity and turned to evil, it could no longer live in its home plane and had to retreat to the [[Prime Material plane]].

==Combat==
As un-aging creatures of immense powers, empyreans did not contemplate their own mortality and recklessly charged into battle even if at the brink of being slain. They could do devastating earth-shaking damage with their weapons and bolts of pure energy, and could considerably bolster their allies, amplifying their abilities and resistance to magic effects. Empyreans could also innately cast a number of [[spells]], such as ''[[commune]]'', ''[[dispel evil and good]]'', ''[[earthquake]]'', ''[[fire storm]]'', ''[[greater restoration]]'', ''[[pass without trace]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', and ''[[water walk]]''.

==Society==
An empyrean who was slain in battle was typically resurrected by one of its parents in its home plane. The only exception was when the empyrean's parents had a reason not to revive their child.

==Notable Empyreans==
[[Nalkara]] was the empyrean daughter of [[Auril]] and [[Thrym]]. She owed a favor to [[Halaster Blackcloak]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

[[Uldrak]] was a servant of the god [[Surtur]] who quested to the [[Nine Hells]] to slay [[Tiamat]] for his deity. Instead of killing the goddess however, he was instead transformed into a [[Spinagon]].
