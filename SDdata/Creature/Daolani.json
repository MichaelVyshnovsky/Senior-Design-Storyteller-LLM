They were never shy about telling their masters what they wanted. These selfish creatures lacked sympathy for anyone in trouble.\nUnlike their cousins, the mighty dao, these gen did not covet gems save for the occasional snack.\n*Lil Mountain, a daolani familiar of the planeswalking dwarvish shair named Kursh Do Ran in the late 14 century DR."
