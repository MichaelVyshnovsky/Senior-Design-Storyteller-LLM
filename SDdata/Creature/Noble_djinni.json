        "mainbody": "Noble djinn ruled the genies living on the Elemental Plane of Air.\nNoble djinn were taller and more fair than regular djinn, who had darker complexions. They were as strong as common efreet.\nNoble djinn had an extensive array of magical abilities. Like all djinn, these creatures could use a special whirlwind power to either attack or transport other beings. They could create food, beverages, and other items out of thin air, as well as form powerful illusions.\nLike other djinn, noble djinn could turn invisible at will or take gaseous form. Like all true genies, they could plane shift.\nThe true power of noble djinn, which made them distinct from lesser djinn, was their ability to grant wishes.\nAll air-based attacks were utterly useless against noble djinn.\nOnly one percent of djinn were noble. Most noble djinn were local rulers of landholders who commanded djinn. Another group of noble djinn spent their time at the court of the Great Caliph of the Djinn on the Elemental Plane of Air.\nServed by regular djinn, noble djinn did not require much from other creatures. Rivalries with other genies prompted them to acquire wealth in many forms.\nThe noble djinn would cooperate with any creature seeking to harm the efreet. Noble djinn worked with other inhabitants of the Elemental Plane of Air as opposed to enslaving them.\n* Calim\n* Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim\n* Nafas"
