In [[Toril]],  they were common in [[Zakhara]]. When merchants from that land began to trade with [[Chult]], they brought with them the almirajes to the [[Chultan Peninsula]].",
        "Description": "Almiraj resembled a large rabbit or [[hare]] with yellowish fur which is soft, and a {{SIAdj|1|ft|c|adj=long}} spiraled horn, usually black in color, in their foreheads, like [[unicorn]]s.",
        "Behavior": "Almiraj were usually timid creatures, considered stupid and unpredictable by some. However, almiraj were also fearless. They were easy to pet and tame, and incredibly faithful to their masters, and [[spellcaster]]s often sought them to make them their [[familiar]]s.",
        "Combat": "When forced to fight, they could be quite dangerous, ramming against their enemies, stabbing them with their horns. They avoided conflict when they could, however if necessary they could inflict serious damage. Almiraj were intelligent enough to fight using simple tactics, such as burrowing to move unnoticed and attack an enemy by surprise.",
        "Notable Almirajes": "[[I'jin]], one of the [[Primal_spirit#The_Nine_Trickster_Gods_of_Chult|Nine Trickster Gods]] of Chult, took the form of an almiraj."
