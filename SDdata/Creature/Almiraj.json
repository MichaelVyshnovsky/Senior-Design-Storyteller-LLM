        "mainbody": "n almiraj (|audio=almiraj.ogg    ) was a variety of fey rabbit-like creature with a spiral horn emerging from its forehead.\nAlmiraj were quite common in the Feywild, considered a garden-variety animal. In Toril,  they were common in Zakhara. When merchants from that land began to trade with Chult, they brought with them the almirajes to the Chultan Peninsula.\nAlmiraj resembled a large rabbit or hare with yellowish fur which is soft, and a  spiraled horn, usually black in color, in their foreheads, like unicorns.\nAlmiraj were usually timid creatures, considered stupid and unpredictable by some. However, almiraj were also fearless. They were easy to pet and tame, and incredibly faithful to their masters, and spellcasters often sought them to make them their familiars.\nWhen forced to fight, they could be quite dangerous, ramming against their enemies, stabbing them with their horns. They avoided conflict when they could, however if necessary they could inflict serious damage. Almiraj were intelligent enough to fight using simple tactics, such as burrowing to move unnoticed and attack an enemy by surprise.\nIjin, one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult, took the form of an almiraj."
