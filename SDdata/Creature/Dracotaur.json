        "mainbody": "Drakkoths, also called dracotaurs because of their passing similarity to centaurs, were a predatory, nomadic species related to dragons.\nA dracotaur had a similar body structure to a centaur, with the upper body of a humanoid and the lower body of a wingless dragon. They had a  tail ending in large spikes, which was mainly used for balance, but could also be used as a weapon. Male dracotaurs possessed crests on their heads, throats, and chests, which ranged in color from bright red to dark purple.\nDracotaurs were sly and aggressive predators. They were typically merciless in battle. They had an affinity for the study of sorcery.\nDracotaurs were able to produce small gouts of flame by spitting a globule of sticky saliva that burst into flames upon contact with air, similar to alchemists fire. Once they do so, they cannot spit flames again for one minute.\nIn addition, dracotaurs produced a bodily oil that softened their scales, along with any leather armor, keeping them supple.\nIn combat, dracotaurs typically employed ambush tactics before releasing a gout of flames and rushing into combat with spears.\nDracotaur societies took the form of small nomadic tribes. While different tribes had a habit of fighting among themselves, they were quick to form alliances to defend against outside threats. In addition, alliances with other reptilian species such as lizardfolk and nagas were not uncommon.\nDracotaurs saw true dragons as the embodiments of their ancient gods and were willing to serve such dragons.\nDue to their nomadic culture, dracotaurs rarely constructed permanent buildings, preferring to utilize ruins.\nThey had a deep hatred of centaurs, whom they would attack on sight and whenever the two races existed in the same region a brutal war of extermination would erupt. Upon killing a centaur, dracotaurs would feast on their flesh."
