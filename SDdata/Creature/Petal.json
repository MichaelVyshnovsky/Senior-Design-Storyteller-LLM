        "mainbody": "Petals were small, well-meaning fey whose habits often endangered those they tried to \"help\".\nPetals were small fey, only about  tall and weighing only . Their skin color was always some flowery shade, anything from a pale pastel to vibrant red or yellow. In place of hair, they had a flower-like blossom, typically of a different shade than their skin. They were known to be patterned, with speckles or stripes, or paler tips or centers. The wings were of a like color and pattern to the skin.\nWhile they were often viewed by other fey as mischievous pests, petals were, though whimsical, only doing what they saw as right and good.\nPetals had only their magical singing with which to fight and defend themselves, but it was potent enough for their preferred purposes. Their singing had two forms the first was a lullaby that any petal could sing, and which lulled any creature within a  radius around the petal as if by the lullaby spell. The second form required two or more petals, but it affected any creature within  of either petal as if by the sleep spell. Any further petals who joined the sleep song only strengthened it. However, a creature that managed to resist the effects of a song was unaffected by that song for the next 24 hours.\nPetals lived in temperate forests, where they typically served more powerful fey, such as sprites or dryads, as messengers, attendants, and servants. In other cases, they would cluster near a powerful plant creature such as a treant for protection.\nIn the philosophy of petals, all travelers and adventurers needed a restful sleep, and all deserved to wake up refreshed and surrounded by beauty. In order to carry out this philosophy, however, they would sing travelers to sleep, divest them of their gear and garb them instead in clothing made of flowers, and leave their victim to awake in an idyllic environment. They piled the removed items nearby, never stealing anything, for that would be wrong.\nIn practice, however, nearby predators and unscrupulous persons were happy to take advantage of the opportunities that petals inadvertently provided them.\nCampfire stories were told about both petals and thorns to children in the Dalelands to keep them from journeying too far into the forests there."
