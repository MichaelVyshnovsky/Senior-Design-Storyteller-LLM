            "Legacy": "The transformed batrachi lived on in Limbo, but were often confused with the similarly amphibious [[slaad]]i who also dwelt there.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Cosmologies, Limbo, and the Prime}} Some thought the [[Pandemonium Stone]] in the [[Elemental Chaos]] was a batrachi artifact and furthermore that examining it would reveal the truth of whether the slaadi had descended from the batrachi. Bazim-Gorag was Lord of the Pandemonium Stone and an ascended batrachi invoked by gamblers and those desperate for luck.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-350}}, [[Haask, Voice of Hargut|Haask]], priest-king of [[Grong-Haap]], reigning from [[Ironfang Keep]], was revealed to be not a [[greathorn minotaur]] but a batrachi-doppelganger hybrid, when attacked and mortally wounded.<ref>{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep}}\n\nThe debased descendants of the remaining batrachi lived on in the deepest, darkest swamps of [[Faerûn]], but were presumed long extinct by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nHowever, the batrachi created or were the ancestors of a number of the amphibious, piscine, and shapeshifting races of the Realms, including the bullywugs, doppelgangers, and kuo-toa.\n\nAn intricate runic design theorized to have originated among the batrachi was used by the [[Imaskari]] in the construction of their [[Bukhara Spires]], during their Early Dynastic Period ({{Yearlink|-7975}} to {{Yearlink|-6422}}). Employing transdimensional magic, these were permanent two-way ''[[portal]]s'' that allowed the Imaskari to cross the continent in moments.\n\nA memory of a conversation between Bazim-Gorag the Firebringer and a [[human]] member of the [[Order of the Black Flame]], in which he spoke of the batrachi, found its way into the [[God-Brain]] of [[Oryndoll]] when that member was captured and mind-read by the [[illithid]]s in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]."
