They were found in wildspace, around the same areas where beholder nations laid.\nOn Toril, argos could be found in the Moonlit Tower and the lowest levels of Undermountain.\nAn adventuring party carrying the Stone that Speaks was slain by an argos on the site of Tempuss Tears.\nAn argos was brought to Spindleskulls Tomb by the Zhentarim wizard Baergil. The creature was kept there for the purpose of killing any fellow Zhent wizards transported to the tomb by its captor, using a specialized variant of a teleport spell."
