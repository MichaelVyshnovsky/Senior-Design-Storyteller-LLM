        "Overview": "The Iron Phoenix had the ability to use a limited number of ''[[flame strike]]s'' and of sonic screams every day. If it was sufficiently damaged, it would collapse into the flaming pits within the room to regenerate within the day, much like a regular phoenix. It also had the ability to attack by pecking or clawing.\n\nIn {{yearlink|1356}}, the phoenix may have slain a number of [[guilder]]s who attempted to enter its protected area.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|116}} It was instructed to frighten, but never attack, anyone going through the middle of the room, however.",
        "Trivia": "A message from Martek around the entrance suggested that the iron phoenix was a monument to Phoenix.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|116}}"
