        "mainbody": "'''Jann''' ({{Singular|janni|refs=<ref group=\"note\">When [[Gary Gygax]] first introduced the Jann in [[Dragon magazine 66|''Dragon #66'']], he used the term \"jann\" for the singular and \"jannee\" for the plural. This was changed in 2e and 3e. As the majority of [[Forgotten Realms]] sources use the 2e/3e terms, this wiki follows the same pattern, which is also consistent with the singular and plural terms for [[djinn]] and [[efreet]].}}) were the weakest of all [[genie]]s. Unlike other genies, jann were not intimately bonded to one particular element or native of a singular [[elemental plane]], instead they were natives of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. The jann of [[Toril]] resided in great numbers within [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.",
        "Description": "[[File:Janni2.PNG|thumb|left|200px|''A female janni.'']]\nJann resembled powerfully built [[human]]s or [[half-elves]]. Members of both sexes were usually quite attractive. The average janni stood between six and seven feet (180 to 210 centimeters) tall. Their skin was the color of golden sand or earth, allowing them to mingle unnoticed among the dark-skinned [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]], and they were often mistaken for the humans they resembled. Their eye color varied greatly, but always held a supernatural intensity. Compared to humans, jann were intellectual geniuses.\n\nJann were composed of all four of the elements, [[air]], [[Earth (element)|earth]], [[fire]], and [[water]].\n\nA janni could live to be 300 years old.",
        "Personality": "Jann were usually friendly toward strangers within their desert territories. For the most part, they did not show preference or malcontent toward any race over the other, preferring to judge people based upon their actions and whether or not they were [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]]. However, they did not usually like [[demihuman]]s, and they hated other kinds of [[humanoids]]. The jann's trust in others waned as they reached or exceeded the boundary of their territory where they felt more uncomfortable. \n\nAs a race, jann strove to maintain a strong relationship with the [[djinn]]. They often called upon the djinn to aid them under dire circumstances. [[Efreet]] and [[dao]] were merely tolerated. The [[marid]], however, were treated as royalty.",
        "Abilities": "Very tough of skin, all jann were immune to the effects of the desert heat and injury or irritation caused by windborne [[sand]]. They were especially resistant to fire.\n\nBoth sexes of jann possessed great strength, with the men being slightly stronger on average than the women. However, the weakest female janni was still stronger than the majority of hulking human men. They had [[darkvision]].\n\nJann possessed spell-like abilities that they used to their advantage. They could increase or decrease their height to a maximum of 24 feet (seven meters) and a minimum of two inches (five centimeters). Jann could also use this ability to shrink or enlarge anyone they touched, willing or unwilling. Jann could turn themselves [[invisibility|invisible]], [[create food and water]], and become [[Etherealness|ethereal]]. They could also fly and breathe underwater at will.\n\nJann were capable of traveling instantly to the [[Astral plane|Astral]] and [[Ethereal plane]]s, as well as all of the elemental planes. Jann were not immune to any negative effects from the elemental planes, prompting them to stay for no longer than 48 hours at a time before they needed to return home or risking slowly damaging themselves. After returning to their home, jann needed to wait for another 48 hours before traveling back to an elemental plane. They could also bring up to six or eight travelers with them to these planes, provided they all linked hands. All travelers enjoyed a janni's protection while visiting an elemental plane.",
        "Society": {
            "Language": "[[Midani]] was the adopted form of communication for jann in Zakhara, though they could also speak [[Common]]. Additionally, they spoke [[Jannti]], the common genie tongue, and could communicate with animals at will. Interestingly, any animal with whom a janni spoke would never attack that janni. They also had the telepathic capabilities of other genies."
        },
        "Combat": "Most jann wore [[chainmail]] or [[lamellar]] armor in battle but suffered no ill consequences from heat exhaustion when fighting under the intense heat of the day. Great [[scimitar]]s and [[composite longbow]]s were used so the jann could take full advantage of their great strength. A janni's large fists were also quite effective when used during combat.\n\nAmirs sometimes led large forces of jann and humans. Jann were quite fearsome when fought within their desert homeland. While rare, a janni encountered outside of the desert was awkward and uncomfortable. Jann enjoyed a degree of resistance to anything magical while within the boundary of the desert or up to one mile beyond the edge of the desert.\n\nIf a band of jann were losing a battle, they would turn invisible and fly away to regroup, maneuvering to take a better tactical position.",
        "History": "One rumor insinuated that the jann were created initially by powerful [[Elemental creature|elementals]] so that they could grant [[wish]]es to other genies. However, jann were not able to perform this feat.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-7800}}, a large army of djinn supported by a large company of jann foot soldiers appeared near what was to become [[Calimport]] and began occupying the southern portion of [[west Faer√ªn]] and cleansing it of the native populations of elves, giants, and dragons (the dwarves tried to remain neutral). From this campaign, they built the [[Calim Empire|Calim Caliphate]].\n\nOver a millennium later, the [[efreet]] arrived, led by the Great Pasha [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]], to challenge the djinn. After hundreds of years of skirmishes, plotting, intrigue, and side wars with the remnants of the locals, the forces of Calim and Memnon finally met head on in a conflagration that lasted a hundred years ({{Yearlink|-6200}} to {{Yearlink|-6100}}). The great armies essentially destroyed each other, and the colossal forces used against their enemies seared the land and created the [[Calim Desert]], leaving only a few jann and no djinn nobles to rule the empire. By the year {{Yearlink|-6060}}, the last of the djinn were vanquished by an alliance of their former slaves (mostly humans) and the dwarves, who supplied them with weapons. In the peace that followed, the nation of [[Coramshan]] was born in the land south of the [[Marching Mountains]]. The fate of the jann remains unknown.",
