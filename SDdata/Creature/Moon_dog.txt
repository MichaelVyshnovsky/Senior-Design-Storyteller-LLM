at the shoulder
Moon dogs were celestials native to the Blessed Fields of Elysium.
Moon dogs resembled large dogs, about  tall at the shoulder, with silvery fur and obsidian-black eyes. Moon dogs had opposable digits on their front paws, allowing them to use those paws as hands. Additionally, the face had some slight human characteristics.
Moon dogs were relentless hunters of evil. Because of this, they rarely associated with anyone for long. They were generally friendly to other good creatures.
Moon dogs spoke the languages of celestials and devils, as well as Common. They could also use telepathy to communicate with creatures within 50 feet of them.
Moon dogs possessed a wide variety of abilities, including a number of magical powers. Among them, they could always detect evil, magic, traps, and invisibility. By licking a wound, they could slow poison, remove disease, or even completely heal a minor one.
Moon dogs could dispel illusions by whining. By barking, a moon dog could dispel evil. When one bayed, it instilled fear in all evil creatures within 80 feet of it. And when a moon dog howled, all evil creatures within  of it were damaged and possibly dismissed. The more moon dogs that were howling, the harder it was to resist the dismissal effect.
