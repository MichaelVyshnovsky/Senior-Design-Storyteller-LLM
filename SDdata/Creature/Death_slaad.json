        "Description": "Death slaads were visually indistinguishable from gray slaads.",
        "Personality": "Despite still having all memories of their former [[green slaad|green]] and gray slaad selves, the behavior of the death slaadi starkly contrasted their previous attitudes, specifically in regards to their interests. No longer concerned with increasing their magical powers, death slaadi were sadists focused on bringing death and pain to those around them, the most powerful of which undergoing [[rogue]] training in order to later become full-fledged [[assassin]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Death slaadi, by some mysterious means, obtained many of their powers by controlling the [[Spawning Stone]] in [[Limbo]]. They were creatures of destruction and decay, stunning and rotting those they struck with their natural weapons and draining the life energy from those they pierced with their fangs. They possessed the same potential powers as their former selves in addition to more death related spell-like abilities such as [[cloudkill]], [[astral projection]], [[phantasmal killer]], [[finger of death]] and [[circle of death]].\n\nLike in their previous forms, they could [[polymorph]] into their original humanoid hosts, reportedly while retaining their incredible strength. They could also summon [[red slaad|red]], [[blue slaad|blue]], green and gray slaads, although not other death slaads.",
        "Combat": "Though they seldom wore armor and were lethally proficient with their claws and fangs, death slaads preferred to wield magical weaponry, often blades such as [[sword of sharpness|swords of sharpness]].",
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "As beings dedicated to death, some death slaads became cultists known as pale raiders, [[cleric]]s that inhabited the [[Negative Energy Plane]] and were revitalized in their desire of magical power, not for its own sake but to honor death in all its forms."
        },
        "Ecology": {
            "Spawning Stone": "During the death slaadi breeding season, they filled a few hundred yards around the Spawning Stone with poisonous and acidic fogs, making it uninhabitable for the red slaads that arrived there first. However, despite their power, they would inevitably be forced away by the mobs of red slaadi, possibly because their egg-pellets could infect even them."
        },
        "Notable Death Slaadi": "* [[Loru]], the death slaad who drove the miller from [[Daggerford]] insane and sought to infect the grains with a slaadi plague to create an army out of local farmers in [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Sorel]], the death slaad lieutenant of Ygorl being trained to become the Slaad Lord of Anarchy and a powerful weapon of chaos.\n* [[Thuruppl]] the Kicker, an ancient death slaad that led his own private army of battle-hardeneded blue slaads known as the Quick Tongue."
