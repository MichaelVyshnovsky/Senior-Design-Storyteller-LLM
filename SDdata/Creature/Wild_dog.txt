'''Wild dogs''' were a kind of [[dog]] that roamed throughout [[Faer√ªn]].

==Behavior==
Wild dogs did not usually approach [[humanoid]]s unless they were starving or they had been provoked. If left to their own devices, they would avoid contact. It was possible to tame them, but they had to be separated from their pack first.

The Cormanthor wild dog was native to the forest of [[Cormanthor]] and behaved unlike other wild dogs. It was extremely aggressive and vengeful and would track its prey for as long as is necessary to make its kill. It was not averse to attacking medium-sized humanoids, and although omnivorous, preferred to eat mammal flesh.

==Ecology==
Wild dogs generally shared the same habitats as [[wolves]], widely encountered in plains, scrublands, broken ground, hills, and mountainous terrain.

Besides Cormanthor, as well as in the hills of [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], and [[Sembia]]. 

In the land of [[Kara-tur]], they could be found in that region's tropical and subtropical deserts. In [[east Zakhara]], wild dogs could be found in the [[Grey Jungle]], the [[Furrowed Mountains]], and in the [[Genies' Garden]].

==Trivia==
* The spell ''[[conjure animals]]'' could summon a wild dog to the aid of its caster.
