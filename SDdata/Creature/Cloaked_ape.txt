Cloaked apes were man-sized diurnal foragers found in the jungles covering the Sanrach Mountains of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula.
A large flap of skin stretching from the apes wrist to their ankle gave these creatures their name. This skin allowed them to glide over short distances when jumping between treetops. When not in use, these flaps resembled folded cloaks.
These creatures were highly territorial, but seldom attacked intruders unless severely outnumbering them. They preferred instead to remain safe in the treetops and hoot and holler at any intruders, occasionally hurling fruit or branches.
Cloaked apes would claw and bite if attacked. Though they could not regenerate lost limbs, cloaked apes were capable of healing rapidly.
These creatures inhabited the treetops where they could forage for nuts and fruits, gliding between the trees with ease.
