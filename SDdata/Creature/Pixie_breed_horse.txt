'''Pixie breed horses''' were a cross-breed of [[fey]] and equine from the [[Blade Kingdoms]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
Pixie horses were a quick and nervous breed, easily distinguished from other [[horse]]s by their two feathery antennae that grew up from their brows.

==History==
Along with the huge metallic [[Gens D'Or]], pixie horses were breeds only seen in the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, these creatures were used by heralds of the city-state of [[Sumbria]]. One such herald was sent to negotiate peace following the disastrous battle in the [[Valley of Umbricci]] in the early fall. The herald was murdered by the conniving [[Colletran]]s under the rule of their new Prince-elect [[Ugo Svar√©zi]].
