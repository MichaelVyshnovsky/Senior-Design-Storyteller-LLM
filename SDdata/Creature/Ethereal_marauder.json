        "mainbody": "An ethereal marauder was a predatory monster from the Ethereal Plane.\nMarauders resemble blue or purple two-legged lizards with long, flexible tails. Having no neck to speak of, their massive mouth with its three mandibles was attached directly to the creatures body. The mouth was lined with black teeth. Between each pair of mandibles were one of its three tiny eyes.\nMarauders on average grew to stand  tall and , though some specimens could reaches sizes double that. They typically weighed around .\nThe native behavior of ethereal marauders on their home plane was not well-known. Their forays into the Prime Material Plane occurred when they were hunting prey. They had no society or culture but behaved more similarly to natural wild animals.\nSurvivors of their attacks claimed that they made an \"eerie whine,\" which varied in pitch depending on the monsters speed and condition\nMarauders had the magical ability to shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane and back again, much like the spell ethereal jaunt. They would use this innate ability to ambush prey, snapping into existence, biting with their razor teeth, and retreating into etherealness.\nIn 1372 DR, the famous ranger Drizzt DoUrden and his companions were attacked by a rare cluster of overgrown ethereal marauders, while investigating the ruins of the dwarven and Orcish town of Baffenburg. Whatever catastrophe destroyed the town was thought to have weakened the planar barriers between the Material and Ethereal Planes, which was why the marauders were roaming there.\nSome time in the 14 century DR, a ethereal marauder took up residence in the abandoned Moon Tower of Elembar.\nThese creatures usually hunted alone.\nNilshai, sorcerers of the same plane, were said to keep ethereal marauders as guardians."
