'''Yahcha''' ({{Pronounce|YAH|chah|refs=

==Description==
Yahcha beetles were meaty and fairly large [[insect]]s&mdash;about the size of a [[human]] hand.

==Behavior==
They were harmless creatures that moved very slowly.

==Ecology==
Yahcha beetles were generally solitary. They ate [[worm]]s and [[maggot]]s, and were in turn quite easy to catch. Eating the meaty flesh of a yahcha beetle (whether raw or cooked) was a known treatment for [[blue mist fever]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], yahcha beetles could be purchased in [[Port Nyanzaru]] for 1 [[gold piece]] per specimen.
