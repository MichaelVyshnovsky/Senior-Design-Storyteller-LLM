'''Felldrakes''' were a group of [[drake]]s created by [[Bahamut]].

==Description==
The felldrakes were all relatively small, wingless dragons.

==Personality==
All felldrakes were fierce, loyal, and good at heart, thanks to the blood of Bahamut that ran within them.

==Abilities==
Like all dragons, felldrakes had [[darkvision]] and [[low-light vision]], and were immune to magic that induced sleep or paralysis.

==Society==
Felldrakes lived alongside [[elves]] as guards and protectors.

==Species==

There were a variety of known species of felldrakes.

*[[Crested felldrake]] - a cunning felldrake that lived in packs.
*[[Hissing felldrake]] - slightly larger than crested felldrakes, with coppery scales, hissing felldrakes were fast creatures with soporific venom in their saliva.
*[[Horned felldrake]] - distinctive for their forward-facing horns.
*[[Leaping felldrake]] - green-scaled and natural camoflauged in forests, they were smaller but venomous.
*[[Spitting felldrake]] - slender and capable of spitting acid.
*[[Spiked felldrake]] - the largest species.
*[[Tri-horned felldrake]] - tough, territorial, and agressive; this species would claim an area as its lair and refuse to leave until instructed otherwise. Capable of coralling lesser felldrakes.

==History==
[[File:Spikedfelldrake3e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A spiked felldrake.'']]
Felldrakes were created by Bahamut after a group of powerful [[elven]] mages helped him defeat a [[demon]]ic invasion. He then created the felldrakes to guard the elves against future incursions.

Tales from [[Nerath]] claimed that felldrakes were actually created by cruel, decadent nobles of an empire of that world, and had simply been bred from common drakes.
