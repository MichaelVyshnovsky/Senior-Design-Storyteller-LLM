Felldrakes were a group of drakes created by Bahamut.
The felldrakes were all relatively small, wingless dragons.
All felldrakes were fierce, loyal, and good at heart, thanks to the blood of Bahamut that ran within them.
Like all dragons, felldrakes had darkvision and low-light vision, and were immune to magic that induced sleep or paralysis.
Felldrakes lived alongside elves as guards and protectors.

There were a variety of known species of felldrakes.
*Crested felldrake - a cunning felldrake that lived in packs.
*Hissing felldrake - slightly larger than crested felldrakes, with coppery scales, hissing felldrakes were fast creatures with soporific venom in their saliva.
*Horned felldrake - distinctive for their forward-facing horns.
*Leaping felldrake - green-scaled and natural camoflauged in forests, they were smaller but venomous.
*Spitting felldrake - slender and capable of spitting acid.
*Spiked felldrake - the largest species.
*Tri-horned felldrake - tough, territorial, and agressive this species would claim an area as its lair and refuse to leave until instructed otherwise. Capable of coralling lesser felldrakes.

Felldrakes were created by Bahamut after a group of powerful elven mages helped him defeat a demonic invasion. He then created the felldrakes to guard the elves against future incursions.
Tales from Nerath claimed that felldrakes were actually created by cruel, decadent nobles of an empire of that world, and had simply been bred from common drakes.
