        "Description": "A helmed horror was an empty suit of [[Plate mail|plate]] armor, standing as much as {{SI|7|feet}} tall, with purple magical light flickering between the joints.\n\nThey often carried a [[greatsword]] and a heavy [[crossbow]].",
        "Abilities": "Helmed horrors could move through the air, as with the spell ''[[air walk]]'' supplemented by the ability to ''[[feather fall]]''. They could see unseen creatures and objects, as the spell ''[[see invisibility]]''.",

They went after soft foes first with ranged attacks and used their [[magic]] to outmaneuver foes.\n\nThey were highly resistant to [[magic]] and immune to poisons, diseases, and mind-altering effects. They possessed an innate ability to imbue their weapons with potent offensive [[Item enchantment|enchantments]], such as causing it to [[flaming|ignite]].\n\nWhen a helmed horror was defeated, its armor would crumble into slag.",

            "Creation": "The process of creating helmed horrors was something of a closely kept secret for many years. While unknown to the magical community at large, a great number of [[cleric]]s of [[Bane]], [[lich]]es, and evil [[wizards]] knew well how to create these constructs. In later times, it was uncommon knowledge. A powerful spellcaster, with knowledge of both construct creation and arms and armor creation was needed, and a special workroom, along with the spells needed for the ritual.\n\nThe spell of ''[[mailed might]]'' could be used to animate mundane sets of metal armor into versions of helmed horrors. When horror created via this spell died, they exploded in a burst of shrapnel, yet simply returned to unanimated state once the spell expired.{{Cite dragon/344/A Dark and Stormy Knight|60-61}}"
