        "mainbody": "helmed horror was an animated construct formed from a suit of armor and often found as a guardian.\nThe most powerful type of helmed horror was the battle horror,\nA helmed horror was an empty suit of plate armor, standing as much as  tall, with purple magical light flickering between the joints.\nThey often carried a greatsword and a heavy crossbow.\nHelmed horrors could move through the air, as with the spell air walk supplemented by the ability to feather fall. They could see unseen creatures and objects, as the spell see invisibility.\nthumb|left|A helmed horror imbuing its weapon with fire.Helmed horrors fought intelligently. They went after soft foes first with ranged attacks and used their magic to outmaneuver foes.\nThey were highly resistant to magic and immune to poisons, diseases, and mind-altering effects. They possessed an innate ability to imbue their weapons with potent offensive enchantments, such as causing it to ignite.\nWhen a helmed horror was defeated, its armor would crumble into slag.\nThey were often created to protect specific locations, but occasionally they were given special tasks requiring them to travel. As tireless constructs, they often outlived their creators, and pursued their final directives for eternity.\nThe process of creating helmed horrors was something of a closely kept secret for many years. While unknown to the magical community at large, a great number of clerics of Bane, liches, and evil wizards knew well how to create these constructs. In later times, it was uncommon knowledge. A powerful spellcaster, with knowledge of both construct creation and arms and armor creation was needed, and a special workroom, along with the spells needed for the ritual.\nThe spell of mailed might could be used to animate mundane sets of metal armor into versions of helmed horrors. When horror created via this spell died, they exploded in a burst of shrapnel, yet simply returned to unanimated state once the spell expired.\nHelmed horrors were first created over 5,000 years ago. Both Netheril and Imaskar were known to have used them.\nthumb|right|250px|A helmed horror with a flail attached to its arm.\nThe wizard Olonther of The Riders of the Sword mercenary company built dozens of battle horrors to defend their stronghold,The Hold of the Sword.\nThe Seat of Might in Myrinjar was guarded by several helmed horrors.\nBattle horror shadowguards were employed to defend the \"silent vaults\" of Hlintar in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIn addition, the deities Deep Duerra, Flandal Steelskin, Gaerdal Ironhand, Gorm Gulthyn, Helm, and Laduguer made use of these constructs."
