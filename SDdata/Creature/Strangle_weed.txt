Strangle weeds were an intelligent species of kelp.
This species of plant was indistinguishable from normal seaweed. It typically grew in  oval patches. Their friends grew to be  in length.
This species of plant had a basic animal level of intelligence.
These plants would detect vibrations in the water and reach out towards their source.
Creatures that were unconscious or calmly floating in the water had a greater chance of escaping the grasp of strangle weeds than those who frantically thrashed about.
An evil mage in eastern Scardale once raised a group of skeletons to work as farmhands at the gardens of his estate, harvesting crops that partially consisted of bizarre strains of mantraps and strangle weeds. Long after the mage passed away, his skeletons continued harvesting these crops well into the 14 century DR.
Strangle weeds were a carnivorous species of plant.
Strangle weeds were typically found in sea waters with a tropical or subtropical climate.
They were known to grow in the waters around Ravens Bluff, the temperate and tropical areas of the Sea of Fallen Stars, as well as in parts of Cormyr, Sembia, and the Dalelands. In Cormanthyr they could be found in the eastern edges of the Old Elven Court. In south Faer√ªn, they grew in the Thornwood.
Beyond Faerun, strangle weeds grew in the jungles and tropical forests of Maztica. In Zakhara, strangle weeds could be found on the surface level of salt water bodies and in the depths of fresh water bodies.
Beyond Toril, these plants grew on the planet of Oerth. Outside of the Prime Material plane, strangle weed was quite common in the savannahs of Yeenoghus realm in the Abyss.
Strangle weeds were a favored plant of the deity Thard Harr.
