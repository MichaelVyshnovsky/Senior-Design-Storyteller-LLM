Gohei poh, also known as paper ghosts, were evil spirits created by wu jen in Kara-Tur.
Gohei poh looked like a blank sheet of parchment about the size of a book page. It had no writing on its surface, and if anyone tried to write on it, the ink vanished.
Gohei poh were most often used to guard an item or a room. Gohei poh obeyed any command from the wu jen that created it, including killing a target or fighting to the death. Gohei poh could fold themselves into several forms. During the folding process, the gohei poh floated in midair and was unable to do anything else until the process was completed. 
* Box The most lethal form, the gohei poh folded itself into a small box. If a target came within  of the box, they were sucked into it and deposited to a random location on the Ethereal Plane. The target was then trapped in this new location unless they had a means to return to the Prime Material Plane or elsewhere. A gohei poh also used this ability on itself to escape, by turning the box inside out, basically "swallowing" itself. It was trapped on the Ethereal Plane for a day before it was able to transport itself back to the Prime Material Plane.
* Dove This form resembled a small origami of a dove. While in this form, the gohei poh was able to flutter about a room, attacking a target by slashing at them with its sharp wingtips.
* Pinwheel The gohei poh folded itself into a pinwheel shape, which floated in the air. It was able to attack a target with a strong gust of wind from up to  away.
Gohei poh were able to detect any living creature or spirit within , even if invisible. 
Gohei poh were created by evil wu jen. The wu jen selected a book containing evil knowledge and subjected several pages within to a ceremony that corrupted them. Over six months, the writing on the pages faded until blank, at which point a gohei poh was created. A wu jen was able to create up to four gohei poh at a time. Gohei poh had no sensory organs and did not require food or water.
