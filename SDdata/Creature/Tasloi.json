        "Description": "Tasloi were {{SI|3|ft}} tall with gold, [[cat]]-like eyes; their green skin was thinly covered in coarse, black hair. They had a stooped, crouching posture and their knuckles dragged on the ground when they walked.",
        "Abilities": "Tasloi were known to be very quick and nimble as they moved between the trees, however, their eyes were easily dazzled in bright sunlight. Despite this, tasloi did possess [[low-light vision]].",
        "Combat": "Tasloi normally attacked from above, dropping from the treetops onto unwary opponents. If they managed to gain surprise, they used nets to ensnare adversaries, otherwise attacking with their [[short sword]]s and [[javelin]]s. They always used hit-and-run tactics in order to wear down tough foes, thus avoiding any stand-up fights. Tasloi always tried to abscond with slain bodies, thus saving food for the group.",
