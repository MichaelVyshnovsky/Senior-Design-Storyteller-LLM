'''Purebloods''' were the most human-seeming of all true [[yuan-ti]] and one of three main breeds&mdash;the other two being the [[Yuan-ti halfblood|halfbloods]] and the [[Yuan-ti abomination|abominations]].<ref name=RoF-p151/>

==Description==
Purebloods were described as human-like but with minor reptilian features, such as snake-like eyes, a forked tongue, and patches of scales on their skin.<ref name=RoF-p151/>

Purebloods had weights and heights in the same range as [[human]]s.<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/>

===Abilities===
While not as powerful as other yuan-ti forms, purebloods still had psionic powers. Like all yuan-ti, they could morph their bodies into the form of any viper by force of will alone and could sense the presence of any poison nearby. They were also innately resistant to magic. They were not as intelligent as halfbloods, yet they still took pride in being more intelligent on average than humans.<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/>

The psionic powers of purebloods included the ability to [[Charm person|charm]] other humanoids, to [[Animal trance|entrance animals]], to [[cause fear]], to [[Darkness|create darkness]], and to command plants to [[entangle]] opponents.<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/>

Purebloods were very adept at impersonating humans, and often entered human settlements in disguise as spies.<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/><ref name=RoF-p151/>

===Life Cycle===
Pure bloods could mate with halfbloods or abominations but usually did not. Like other yuan-ti, they hatched from eggs and reached adulthood by twelve years of age. An average lifespan for any yuan-ti was 80 years, but attaining an age as great as 120 years was possible.<ref name=RoF-p151/>

==Personality==
Despite being thoroughly wicked, the majority of purebloods had magnetic personalities.<ref name=RoF-p152/> Like all yuan-ti, they tended to be arrogant and self-centered.<ref name=RoF-p151/>

Purebloods were the least likely of the true yuan-ti breeds to remain attached to their tribe. Since they could more easily disguise themselves, they had the freedom to pursue their own interests wherever such things took them. Purebloods were the most likely yuan-ti to use [[Yuan-ti graft|grafts]] to modify their bodies, provided the new serpentine body parts could still be easily hidden with magic or underneath clothing until "needed".<ref name=SK-p10>

===Combat===
Yuan-ti were perfectionists, and only used high-quality weapons.<ref name=RoF-p153> They would rather weaken a foe from a distance than engage in melee combat. If a fight came to that, however, the purebloods would be sent in first as the more powerful and "valuable" yuan-ti waited.<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/>

Purebloods were often equipped with [[studded leather]] armor<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/> and bore [[scimitar]]s and [[heavy shield]]s or [[longbow]]s<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/><ref name=RoF-p153/> They often poisoned their blades and arrows.<ref name=RoF-p153/>

Purebloods who were trained in combat favored the skills of [[ranger]]s.<ref name=MM3.5e-p263/> They were naturally dextrous.<ref name=RoF-p152/>

==Society==

Purebloods served a special role in yuan-ti society by being the liaisons, agents, spies, or assassins, as they could usually readily hide their serpentine features. They also oversaw the "lesser" yuan-ti servitor subraces, the [[broodguard]]s and [[tainted one]]s.<ref name=RoF-p151/>   

===Language===
Purebloods spoke the [[Yuan-ti language]], [[Common]], and any regional languages. They often could speak [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]] or [[Draconic language|Draconic]] as well.<ref name=RoF-p152/>

===Religion===
Purebloods, like the majority of yuan-ti, worshiped the god [[Sseth]].<ref name=RoF-p152/><ref name=RoF-p153/> Free-wandering purebloods sometimes worshiped the god [[Varae]] instead.<ref name=SK-p18> Some sects were known to worship [[demon]]s.

==History==
The [[sarrukh]], one of the [[creator race]]s, created the yuan-ti, including purebloods, millennia ago in controlled magical breeding experiments combining humans, serpents, and sarrukh themselves.<ref name=SK-p9>
