'''Pyreens''', also known as '''peace-bringers''', were an ancient and mysterious [[humanoid]] race of powerful [[druid]]s and [[psionicist]]s native to the desert world of [[Athas]], whose existence was known by very few.

==Description==
Pyreen exhibited physical characteristics of all the major humanoid and [[demihuman]] races of Athas. This including having broad bodies like [[Athasian dwarf|Athasian dwarves]], pointed ears reminiscent of [[Athasian elf|Athasian elves]], eyes like that of a [[human]] or [[w:c:darksun:Giant, Athasian|Athasian giant]], and facial features reminiscent of [[Athasian halfling]]s. A pyreen were rarely ever seen in this natural form, as they preferred to travel around [[shapechange]]d into the form of an animal or one of the many humanoid or demihuman races of Athas.

==Personality==
The pyreens were an incredibly intelligent race with vast knowledge of how Athas was before it became a desert world, but they would not reveal this knowledge to the unworthy, even if it cost them their lives. They had a distaste for combat, but would engage in it when necessary. They were likely to aid druids defending the land, those fighting [[w:c:darksun:defiler|defilers]] or who had fought defilers in the past, but would otherwise callously not intervene in those fighting dangerous creatures. This callousness was due to their long lifespans and dedication to nature, viewing the comparatively shorter lived races as generally not worth them risking their own lives and by extension their mission.

Whenever a pyreen helped or intervened on behalf of others they did so either from afar or in a shapechanged form. They were quite careful about not revealing how powerful they were to others, moderating their psionics or druidic [[magic]] in order to give off the illusion that they were less powerful.

==Abilities==
Pyreens possessed an incredible array of psionic powers under the [[discipline]]s of [[clairsentience]], [[metapsionic]], [[psychometabolism]], and [[telepathy]]. These powers included ''[[absorb disease]]'', ''[[aura sight]]'', ''[[chameleon power]]'', ''[[chemical simulation]]'', ''[[complete healing]]'', ''[[conceal thoughts]]'', ''[[contact]]'', ''[[danger sense]]'', ''[[ego whip]]'', ''[[ejection]]'', ''[[empathy]]'', ''[[energy containment]]'', ''[[enhancement]]'', ''[[gird]]'', ''[[identity penetration]]'', ''[[intellect fortress]]'', ''[[mental barrier]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[mind over body]]'', ''[[mindlink]]'', ''[[psionic blast]]'', ''[[psionic sense]]'', ''[[psychic messenger]]'', ''[[psychic surgery]]'', ''[[spirit sense]]'', ''[[thought shield]]'', ''[[tower of iron will]]'', and ''[[truthear]]''.

==Society==
Members of this race lived solitary, nomadic lives dedicated to preserving and restoring nature on Athas against those who would defile it. They rarely settled in one place permanently, at most taking up residence somewhere for 50 to 100 years, but each pyreen had places they considered it was their duty to guard.

They often carried a variety of [[magical item]]s and at least one concealable magic weapon made of metal, such as a ''+3 [[dagger]]''. Magic items often favored by pyreen included ''[[cloak of protection|cloaks of protection]]'', ''[[bracers of defense]]'', and [[ring]]s.

The extent of the pyreen lifespan was unknown – they lived live for thousands of years, but there existed no records of pyreens dying of old age. It was also unknown whether these incredible lifespans were a racial trait or a result of their incredible druidic powers.
===Diet===
While an omnivorous race that enjoyed fine food and [[wine]]s, like the most powerful of druids the pyreens were capable of sustaining themselves without any nourishment.
===Languages===
All of the humanoid and demihuman racial languages of Athas were known to pyreen, as well as [[supernal]]. They also occasionally knew some of the other languages that existed on Athas.
===Relationships===
Pyreens were sworn enemies of the [[w:c:darksun:Sorcerer-King|Sorcerer-Kings]] and defilers, as they dedicated their lives to undoing the damage both wrought upon the world of Athas. They also had a deep onnection to the spirits of the land, many of them sharing ancestry with [[primal spirit]]s.

==History==
In The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[portal|gate]]'' to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|9}} Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|13}}

After two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large [[erdlu]] [[egg]]s (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two ''[[potion fruit|apples of healing]]''. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination—the [[Ringing Forest]]—the way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|14}}

At some point on their journey to the Ringing Forest, the Malatran heroes ran out of water and were confronted by a female pyreen. She question the heroes, then offered them advice and guidance on reaching their destination, but was unable to stay and help them.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|3}}
