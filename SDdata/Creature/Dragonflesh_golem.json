        "Description": "These [[construct]]s were created from various body parts of dragons, rotting but crudely stitched together to fashion a whole dragon with a patchwork hide.",
        "Behavior": "Drolems had the ability to remember more complex commands than typical golems, but still weren't able to think for themselves and would obey their commands to the letter. In some cases, a drolem even killed its creator because of a too-complex or ambiguous command that allowed such an action.\n\nTrue dragons would destroy these constructs on sight and afterward the dragon would go after its creator to take revenge for this crime against dragonkind.",
        "Ability": "A drolem did in fact have a pair of wings and with them the ability to fly through the air, but only poorly. They also could not run.\n\nLike other golems, drolems were immune to [[magic]] and were even healed by electricity [[spell]]s like ''[[lightning bolt]]''. A drolem didn't have the magical ability or breath weapon of a true dragon, but they still bore the true dragon's frightful presence. They also had [[blindsight]], enabling them to detect any objects and/or creatures within {{SI|150|feet|long=yes}} through their other senses.",
        "Combat": "They attacked with their tails, claws, and wings.",
        "Creation": "The creator of a dragonflesh golem needed to be able to cast high-level [[arcane]] spells and needed to be in possession of a whole dragon corpse or parts from multiple dragons from which they could fashion a whole dragon.\n\nAssembling the drolem required great skill in natural sciences and medicine. To complete the ritual to animate it, the creator needed to cast ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', and ''[[polymorph any object]]'' spells. The whole process cost 200,000 [[gp]] and was draining on the creator.",
        "Notable Dragonflesh Golems": "A Drolem guarded the entrance to [[Synod]], it was created from various pieces from dragons and borne the mark of [[Cult of the Dragon]] on it's chest, altough this mark was a ruse because this drolem was created by the [[Phaerimm]] and the cult would find a drolem to be an abomination <ref>[[Greg A.
