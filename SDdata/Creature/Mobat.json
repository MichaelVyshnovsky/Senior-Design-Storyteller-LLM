        "mainbody": "Mobats (), or huge bats, were rare and extremely large bats, with wingspans of up to  across.\nThese huge omnivores, apart from their large size, were known for their ability to move quickly and silently. They hunted during the night, always on the look out for warm-blooded creatures.\nMobats were known to hibernate during the winter.\nThey were also favored by the patron deity of urds, Kuraulyek, who would send them out to aid the clerics of his chosen race. Mobats were also occasionally used by drow wizards as familiars.\nMobats would, during the night, try to grab leftovers or small animals that were kept by adventurers. Far more intelligent than normal bats, mobats would accumulate treasure, especially shiny objects and silver.\nDue to their almost completely silent and speedy flight, mobats surprised their foes very often. After initiating combat, these bats used their sizeable fangs to bite and tear at their opponents. Piercing screams also formed parts of their attack routines. These screams caused a great deal of pain, such that their foes were forced to cover their ears in response.\nThousand-year Bat These were a type of mobat found in Kara-Tur on the island of Akari. Some acted as servants of the evil sorcerer Opawang.\nThese bats formed flocks of up to eight individuals and dwelt in warm caves. \nThey were found in many places across Faer√ªn, particularly in Daggerdale, and the Stalactite Forest of Skullports central level.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, mobats could be found in the Domains of Dread. With some claiming that they and other bat species were more numerous there than in any other plane of existence.\n* Ragarran priests were capable of summoning two mobats to their aid.\n* The demigod Raxivorts avatar could take the form of a mobat."
