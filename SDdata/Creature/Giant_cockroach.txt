'''Giant cockroaches''' were giant insects found in the [[Underdark]]

==Description==
Giant cockroaches looked identical to their [[cockroach|smaller cousins]], just much larger. Their carapace was usually black, brown or grey in color and was covered in oily secretions.

==Behavior==
Giant cockroaches were extremely combative and hostile.

==Abilities==
Giant cockroaches were capable of detecting the presence of any creature in direct contact with the earth within {{SI|60|ft}}. They had a limited flight ability over a distance of up to {{SI|60|ft}}. The oily secretions that covered their carapace were so potent that any creature within {{SI|30|ft}} was overcome with nausea. Giant cockroaches were immune to all mind-affecting effects and spells.

==Combat==
Giant cockroaches attacked nearly any creature it encountered. 

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Giant cockroaches lived and reproduced in warm areas near water, surrounded by rotting organic material.

Beyond the Underdark, giant cockroaches could be found in the land of [[Zakhara]].
