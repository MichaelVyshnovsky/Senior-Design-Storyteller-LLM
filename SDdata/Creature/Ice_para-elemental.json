        "mainbody": "'''Ice para-elementals''', sometimes referred to as '''cold''' or '''frost para-elementals''',",
        "Description": "These elementals had hulking, humanoid forms composed entirely out of ice, having a translucent white quality and being covered in patches of frost, sometimes covered in sharpened icicles. The glint of light off their roughly hewn forms sometimes gave off the impression of eyes. On average these forms stood around {{SIrange|8|16|ft|long=yes}} tall, though one could also find individuals that were smaller or larger, with the true scope of potential height ranges being {{SIrange|4|40|ft|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Personality": "Like most of their para-elemental kin, their intellects ranged from low to high and they typically had a [[neutral]] disposition.<ref name=\"MotP3e-p181,185 />",
        "Abilities": "Ice para-elementals were impervious to harm from cold-based [[spell]]s and [[magic]]s, but vulnerable to those based around heat. They could only be struck by weapons with a ''+1'' or greater [[enchantment]].\n\nThese elementals exuded an aura of intense cold around them. Their touch was so frigid that it could freeze a body of water, or any other liquid that was primarily composed of water, up to a distance of {{SI|100|sq. ft|long=yes}} and a depth of {{SI|6|in|long=yes}}. And they could freeze metal around them, in a manner similar to the spell ''[[chill metal]]''. If they ever found themselves injured in any way, they could heal themselves if in contact with natural cold material such as ice, snow, or sleet.",
        "Combat": "Ice para-elementals were typically patient combatants, waiting for their enemies to approach them first, with the more larger among them pretending to be rather slow or delayed in movement so they could better lure their opponents closer.",
        "Society": {
            "Diet": "Ice-paralementals gained sustenance consuming their elemental opposition, warmth, converting it into energy. This warmth could be extracted from any source of heat. They by no means needed to obtain warmth in order to survive.",
            "Homelands": "These elementals were indigenous to the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]], ruled over by numerous minor ice para-elemental lords and nobles, referred to by some as \"ice-lords\".\n\nIn the [[Outer Planes]], ice para-elementals could be found in the [[Iron Wastes]], the domain of [[Kostchtchie]] in the [[Abyss]]. In the [[World Tree cosmology]], they could be found in the [[divine realm]] of [[Winter's Hall]].<ref>\n\nOn the [[Prime Material plane]], they were often encountered on the [[River Ith]] in [[Tethyr]], living alongside many other water-based monsters.",
            "Languages": "Those that were intelligent enough spoke their own para-elemental language,",
            "Relationships": "Whilst a good deal of ice para-elementals served in the grand army of [[Cryonax]], most of them ignored his [[evil]] biddings and preferred to remain [[neutral]] and devoted purely to coldness.{{Cite dragon/347/Princes of Elemental Evil|32}} Beyond Cryonax, these para-elementals were known to act as [[favored monster|servants]] of the frost goddess [[Auril]].<ref>",
            "Summoning": "High ranking [[Icepriestess]]es, [[specialty priest]]s in the [[Church of Auril]], were capable of conjuring ice para-elementals once per [[tenday]], in a manner similar to the spell ''[[conjure fire elemental]]''. The more powerful among them were capable of summoning them more than once.<ref><ref> A magical tome of their faith, the ''[[Codicil of White]]'', also featured a ritual for summoning them.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/15/The Glass House|38}}",
            "Usages": "Enchanted projectiles known as ''[[ice bullet]]s'' could be carved from their bodies."

        "Notable": "* [[Permafrost]].\n* [[Zzutam]], an ice para-elemental who was somewhat influential in [[north Faer√ªn]] in [[1369 DR]], their actions contributing to the [[Fall of Zhentil Keep]]."
