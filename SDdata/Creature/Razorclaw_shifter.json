        "mainbody": "Razorclaw shifters were a cat-like variety of shifter, descended from the union of a human or demihuman and the lycanthropes known as weretigers.It is unaddressed as to whether or not razorclaw shifters could possibly be conceived from a union with any of the many other feline lycanthropes that inhabit the Realms, such as werecats.\nRazorclaw shifters resembled humans, but with distinctively cat-like features such as sharp teeth, claws, pointed ears, or fur.\nHowever, in the eyes of a non-shifter, the resemblance was less obvious than the differences. Unlike humans, razorclaws had flat, animal-like noses, larger-than-usual eyes that allowed them to see better in low light, heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, skin that was often of a brownish shade, and much more hair, also commonly brown, than was typical for the common human.\nThough razorclaws were commonly self-reliant, free-spirited, and great at adapting like other shifters, these traits were especially present in them. They also typically strove to carry their own weight in whatever group they were in and trusted in their allies to care for themselves.\nHowever, like other shifters, razorclaws were restrained in their actions by a fear that they might become lost in the savagery that dwelled in their blood. This fear of losing control made many confrontational and reclusive. Some overcame this self-doubt, however, becoming true friends to those they fought beside. However, this feral predatory nature could be to a razorclaws advantage, and they made excellent druids, rangers, rogues, or avengers.\nLike all shifters, razorclaws were capable of minor shapeshifting and could manifest animal-like traits when under stress, such as a tail, fangs, and claws. They sometimes shifted minor parts of their body to look more human, allowing them to avoid anyone confusing them for a true lycanthrope.\nRazorclaws were very mobile fighters, preferring to utilize hit-and-run tactics.\n* Kip, a razorclaw from the island of Gwynneth."
