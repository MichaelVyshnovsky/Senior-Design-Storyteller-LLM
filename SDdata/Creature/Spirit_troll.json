        "mainbody": "A '''spirit troll''' was a very intelligent and rare creature brought about by the magical interbreeding of [[troll]]s and [[invisible stalker]]s.\n\nThey were also spawned when a troll regenerated from being blasted with [[psionic|psychic]] energy, causing them to take a nonphysical form. Spirit trolls were sometimes unaware of this transition as they were still able to employ their teeth and claws, instead attacking their victim's mind.",
        "Description": "These invisible half-breeds looked similar to trolls, but had diffused features. They had an acute sense of smell and superior [[infravision]].\n\nSpirit trolls were said to be odious mutations of [[spectral troll]]s. These creatures were very dexterous and were immune to becoming exhausted, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, and falling prone and unconscious. They could move through other objects and even creatures.",
        "Combat": "Spirit trolls could only be damaged by magical [[weapon]]s or [[fire]]. They regenerated and attacked with their sharp claws, as did other trolls. They also attacked with vicious bites with their fangs, and could even stun foes. They were resistant to [[acid]], cold, fire, lightning, and thunder.",
        "History": "The secret of their creation was believed to have been lost, and only thirty or so were known to exist."
