}}The '''Sargauth Level''' made up the third level of [[Undermountain]]. It connected to [[Skullport]] by way of a tunnel and the [[River Sargauth]]. It once held the ancient town of [[Stromkuhldur]], which fell into ruins before the late 15{{th}} century. [[Drow]] and [[goblinoid]] parties sought to gain control of these ruins, previously inhabited by the [[Netherese]] and the [[Clan Melairkyn|Melairkyn]] [[dwarves]].

==Geography==
The Sargauth Level was named after the River Sargauth that wound its way through this level of Undermountain.

Broadly, the Sargauth Level could be divided in two big areas. First, ruins that were once a Netherese enclave,

===Entrances===
During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of ways to enter the Sargauth Level existed, although none were immediately apparent:
*The Sargauth Level housed a [[carnelian]] mine that was abandoned by 1371 DR. It also housed the connection to the [[Arcane Chambers]] in the form of a two-way ''[[portal|gate]]'' called the [[Doomgate]] that led to the [[Chamber of the Fallen]].
*The Shimmering Gate was the one operated and controlled by [[Kirukeskai]]. The [[beholder]] could open it to link its [[Eye's Lair|lair]] with any other place within Waterdeep and south of the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] and the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]].

===Notable Locations===
;[[Cavern of the Throne]]:
:The Cavern of the Throne was the destination for people who used one of ''[[Halaster's teleport ring]]s''. It led to a cavern with a magical throne that was once dedicated to [[Tempus]] inhabited by [[Aragauthos]], an imprisoned [[blue dragon]] who killed everybody who entered the cavern because she was promised freedom from the cave when she killed enough people, the Mad Mage had no intention of keeping the promise, in 1371 DR. The entire situation was more dangerous for entering people than it sounded. The reason was that ''Halaster's teleport ring'' was one of Halaster's joke items. On using it, the user lost every possession, including the ring, and arrived into the cavern with no clothes or other equipment.
;[[Hall of Many Pillars]]:
:The Hall of Many Pillars, set in the north-west of the Sargauth Level, was a room with thirty pillars, creating five by six rows. By [[1371 DR]], it was the lair of the vampire [[Thearyn Shalahd]]. The pillars in this room could fell into either of two categories: magical ones and those that had secret doors, the outermost ones. The former caused living creatures that touched such a pillar to suffer an effect like ''[[imprisonment]]'' getting out from which was difficult. It required either the mental command of Thearyn, a ''[[freedom]]'' spell, a ''[[limited wish]]'' or ''[[wish]]'', or forcing the pillar to absorb magic, be it from [[magic item]]s or [[spell]]s. When the pillars were exposed to magic, they harmlessly absorbed it and each time they did so, showed an increasing number of glowing letters that formed a word in [[Thorass]]. Speaking the word out caused the imprisoned one's release. Technically, there was a fifth method to free the imprisoned by means of physical destruction of a pillar, but this way also caused the death of the person alongside his or her freedom. The second category of pillars had physical secret doors.
;[[Island Temple]]:
:The Island Temple was a temple that was run by [[kuo-toa]] and dedicated to a giant frog-like entity. By 1371 DR, it was abandoned by the kuo-toa and inhabited by a group of [[will-o'-wisp]].

===Exit===
The following ways could be used to exit the Sargauth Level:
* In the north part of this level, there was a staircase that went up to level 2, the [[Arcane Chambers]].
* In the west part of this level, a tunnel led to Skullport. A similar tunnel was in the south-west part of this level.
* In the west part of the level, a dimensional gate leading to [[Utter East]] was located in a chamber, marked by a pyramid with a pair of [[mammoth]] tusks rising out of it.
* In the north-east part of this level, there was an [[abyssal circle]] that led to the [[Abyss]].
* In a cave in the southern part of this level, an archgate led to level 5, the [[Wyllowwood Forest]].
* In the ruins of an old house in the north-west part of this level, an archgate led to level 6, the [[Lost Level]].
* The so-called ''Thundergate'' was found in the Lost Cavern, a cavern in the north-east of the Sargauth Level. It was a one-way-''gate'' to the [[Rat Hills]] that was keyed to female [[human]]s, [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[halfling]]s for its activation, except humans members of any sex could activate it. On activation, it remained so for nine minutes but had a peculiarity: it stopped working on the spot for three to eighteen minutes when someone who did not fulfill the activation criteria was the first one to use it. In fact, the name was given by an angry [[dwarf]] who got into his emotional state due to discovering the peculiarity.

==History==
The first people to settle the inside of [[Mount Waterdeep]] was a clan of dwarves called Melairkyn. They did so in [[-1288 DR|&ndash;1288 DR]]. They called the mountain Melairbode and their domain the Underhalls. Among other places, they lived in what was later called the Sargauth Level.

A group of Netherese spellcasters came in [[-750 DR|&ndash;750 DR]] to Melairbode and founded one of their enclaves inside the mountain. While it was not clear how the initial name of this enclave was, later historians referred to it as the Sargauth Enclave, future Skullport. The casters chose a place that was not yet excavated

In [[-339 DR|&ndash;339 DR]], Sargauth enclave suffered the effects of [[Karsus's Folly]] in the form of partial destruction. Its surviving [[arcanist]]s became the entities who were later referred to as the [[Skulls of Skullport]].

In [[1148 DR]], a [[necromancer]] called [[Shradin Mulophor]] did two things. First, he founded a trading post on the ruins of the Sargauth Enclave. Second, he connected the place both by mundane means like creating canals that connected the River Sargauth with other bodies of water and by [[magic]]al means like ''[[portal]]s'', thus creating links to various seas.

==Inhabitants==
;Drow
: An expedition from [[House Auvryndar]] had captured a section of [[Stromkuhldur]]—a former temple dedicated to [[Dumathoin]]—

;Azrok's Army
: [[Azrok]], a [[hobgoblin]] warlord, led a legion on this level. He eventually led his forces to Stromkuhldur, ridding the place of [[troglodytes]] and [[grimlocks]]. He was eventually forced to give up part of his domain when drow attacked him, making many of his subjects turn to the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]].

;Sea Hags
: Several [[sea hag]]s dwelt in the River Sargauth.
