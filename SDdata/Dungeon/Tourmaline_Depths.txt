The '''Tourmaline Depths''' were a subterranean expanse occupied by the ruins of an unknown origin beneath [[Baldur's Gate]] leading to the [[Underdark]].

===The upper levels===
The [[rapier]] ''[[Pelorsun Blade]]'' which had "sliced [[Kas the Bloody-Handed]]'s throat" and its last possessor were buried here and remained intact until 1492 DR.

The upper levels of the Tourmaline Depths were used as [[Cazador Szarr]]'s prison where he held [[vampire spawn]] and slaves.

The Grand Chamber was used for rituals.

==History==
[[Amanita Szarr]] retold the known facts she had read in the writings of [[Vampire|master vampire]] [[Donnella Szarr|Donnella the Architect]]. According to Amanita's book, ''[[The Tourmaline Depths (book)|The Tourmaline Depths]]'', during the period between 1138 and 1204, Donella reopened the sprawling blue-green halls beneath Baldur's Gate, placing them under the [[Szarr|Szarr family]]'s control. Donella suggested that [[dwarven]] exiles from the city of [[Bhaerynden]] were the original builders of the Tourmaline Depths, which seemed to serve as an outpost or a mining facility rather than a city. Still, by 1492 DR, it remained a mystery what resources the dwarves were extracting. It was also puzzling how these long-abandoned depths had stayed hidden beneath a major city like Baldur's Gate for so long.

After killing [[vampire lord]] [[Vellioth the Martinet]], [[Cazador Szarr]] succeeded him as master vampire of Baldur's Gate in {{YearlinkName|1276}}. Cazador made one of the upper rooms his personal bedroom and placed Vellioth's skull on a pillow on a pedestal there.

In {{YearlinkName|1376}}, [[Mordoc SeLanmere]], the Pale Knight, used the [[Onyx Heart]] to transform the citizens of Baldur's Gate into zombies under his control, while his vampires transformed other citizens into vampires. The city was temporarily renamed to Mordoc's Gate. By 1492 DR nothing was known of the relations between Mordoc and Cazador Szarr during the conquest of Baldur's Gate, but it was possible that Cazador assisted Mordoc, as he had a bust of Mordoc SeLanmere in [[Szarr Palace]]. the Tourmaline Depths could have been somehow used by Mordoc.

In {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Cazador Szarr performed the [[Black Mass Ritual]], but was stopped by the [[Absolute Adversaries]].
