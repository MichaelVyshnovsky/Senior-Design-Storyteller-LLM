'''Arcturiadoom''' was the 14{{th}} level of the massive dungeon known as [[Undermountain]]. It served as the personal retreat and [[Lich#Dooms|doom]] of [[Arcturia]], a unique [[lich]] who was infamous for being one of the most powerful of [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster Blackcloak's]] [[seven]] apprentices.

==Description==
Several of the hallways and alcoves were decorated with statues of Arcturia and Halaster himself. While Arcturia thoroughly made the domain her own, many chambers and rooms featured crypts and foundries, holdovers of the old [[Clan Melairkyn|Melairkyn]] [[dwarves]]. Among these was a large [[iron]] tankard that weighed over 1,500 lbs (680.4 kg) and several dwarf-sized statues that had escaped arcane transformation.

As Arcturia herself was a master [[transmuter]], her domain contained a great number of traps that were designed to transmogrify and alter the form of any [[humanoid]] creature that happened to set them off. They typically came in the form of magical ''glyphs'', inscribed into the domain's floors. While they could be easily ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'', they had the potential to possibly alter the form of any interlopers to anything from [[otyugh]]s to [[gelatinous cube]]s and even [[wyvern]]s. 

==Geography==
===Entrances===
* The great [[bore worm]] dug a large tunnel that led down from [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] to a cave that opened up into large set of double doors that featured carvings of skulls that had been eaten away by worms. Behind these doors was they foyer of Arcturiadoom, decorated with [[dwarven]] statues that had been grotesquely altered by Arcturia's magic. 

===Notable Locations===
;Central hall:
: In the center of Arcturiadoom, down a hallway north of the entrance, was grand main hall. Its arched ceiling stood 150' (45.7 m) tall and was buttressed by broad stone pillars. It was illuminated by a number of sconces that were enchanted with ''[[continual flame]]s''. 

;Classroom:
: Like her master Halaster, Arcturia occasionally took on a number of apprentices and dedicated a portion of her domain to their education. However, their quarters were often empty and the classrooms were strewn with evidence of the displeasure she had in her pupils. In addition to words like ''"YOU ALL FAIL"'' being scrawled across the blackboard, the remains of several arcane apprentices could be found throughout this area of Arcturiadoom.

;Disintegration room:
:

;Foundry:
: In the northwest section of Arcturiadoom was a large smithing room with an arched ceiling that reached 30'(9.1 m) high.Based on the damage from 5e SRD 

;Laboratory:
: Arcturia kept a small, but often-used experimentation room in the eastern part of her domain. It featured a large stone operating table, atop which she kept the subjects of her transformative "innovations". Another room just off to the side of the lab had several chains linked to iron rings, which had been bolted to the floor. It gave the [[archmage]] a space to secure some of her particularly hideous creations.

;Prison:
: North of the main entrance, down a pair of halls, was a half dozen holding cells where Arcturia kept her subjects before she could experiment upon them.

;Timekeeping room:
: Within the halls of her realm, Arcturia kept an entire room dedicated to the marking of time, allowing her to keep track of the day and night cycle of [[Toril]]. An 20' (6.1 m) wide iron ring was suspended in the air, attached to the four pillars that extended into the room's partially-concave ceiling. Within this ring was a slightly smaller disc that was inscribed with a symbol of [[the sun]] on one side, and the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]] on the reverse. 

: Two alcoves within the room contained life-size statues of [[human]] [[wizard]]s, 

;Transmutorium:
: A single room in the northern part of Arcturiadoom held some of Arcturia's most horrifying creations. On the western wall hung a tapestry made of flesh, that was in fact the [[beholder]] [[Xebekal]]. After invading her lair, the eye tyrant was stripped of all its powers and transformed by means of a ''[[wish]]'' [[spell]].

: Hidden behind a crystal door within the transmutorium was a small alcove that held a magical device comprising a [[brass]] panel and a number of buttons. Within this chamber any being could be made larger or smaller, as if they were affected by the spell ''[[enlarge or reduce person]]''.

===Exits===

==Inhabitants==
The halls of Arcturiadoom, along the caves outside, were inhabited by several types of creatures and [[humanoid]]s native to the [[Underdark]]. Just outside the front entrance of the archmage's domain, a group of [[carrion crawler]]s dwelled within a small garden of luminescent fungi. [[Giant fire beetle]]s could be found scurrying around the stone floors, and were often thrown together in a large cage to create naturally-powered lanterns.

;Assistants:
: For quite some time, Arcturia had an [[illithid]] assistant who lived within her domain. She even went so far as to create a tentacle-themed private room for them near her own lab. However, after beheading her assist to study the psychic energy found within, she was forced to lure [[Ellix Gaspar]] from the arcane academy [[Dweomercore]]. As of the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Ellix could be found wandering around Arcturiadoom in a state of befuddlement and stupor, after having displeased Arcturia.

;[[Fire giant]]s:
: The half-dozen or so fire giants that called this level home spent most of their time in the foundry. Several of them focused their efforts on the creation of the giant metal construct referred to as ''[[Mecha-Hallaster]]''.

;Experiments:
: Arcturia's domain was full of unique "creations", horrific creatures she had experimented upon in one manner or another. Among these abominations were a, [[ogre]] with the head of a [[carrion crawler]], a two-headed rodent the size of a [[human|man]], a number animated rusty [[sword]]s that were animated into a humanoid form along with an [[umber hulk]] that had been ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into a [[giant scorpion]] and forced to live within an enormous shoe.

*[[Guffaw Gravelstock|Guffaw the Stone Eater]]: One of Arcturia's experiments was a [[deep gnome]] named Guffaw, who had been altered by Arcturia to possess a voracious appetite for worked and carved stone. He felt wholly compelled to eat any such stone he encountered and had to limit to how much he could devour.

;[[Death's Head Phalanx]]:
: This band of [[hobgoblin]]s established a barracks and base camp within the south-eastern halls of Arcturiadoom sometime during the 15{{th}} century DR.

==History==
Before Arcturia claimed this domain as her own it existed as part of the subterranean realm of the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Melairkyn]].

Sometime prior to 1492 DR,{{Waterdeep-time}} [[Emberosa]] and her [[fire giant]] kin came to Arcturiadoom on a mission to aid their efforts in dethroning the [[storm giant]]s of [[Faerûn]] within the [[giant]]s' [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]]. They originally sought an ancient ''[[rune]] of power'' created some 40,000 years before the [[Second Sundering]], which they believed was stolen by dwarves and taken to their domain beneath [[Mount Waterdeep]]. 

During their excursion into Undermountain, the fire giants were accompanied by the [[Death's Head Phalanx]] band of hobgoblins, led by the Warlord known as Doomcrown. 

Within the central hall of Arcturiadoom, the fire giants gathered scrap metal from Trobriand's Graveyard and began construction on an enormous magical-iron automaton called Mecha-Hallaster. This 100' (30.5 m) tall machination was the near-exact duplicate of Halaster himself, though by 1492 DR, it was still incomplete. The Mad Mage intended to use this colossus to combat the [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep|Walking Statues]] of Waterdeep when the time arrived to conquer the surface city.
