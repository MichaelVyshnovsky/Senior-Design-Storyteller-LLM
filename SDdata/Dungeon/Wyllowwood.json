        "Description": {
            "Forest": "The beaches of the River of the Depths were quite narrow and comprised small stones and pebbles. The trees nearest its waters were among the largest in Wyllowwood, with their tangled branches forming a thick canopy that extended beyond the water's edge. \n\nThe forest of Wyllowwood was a lush and inviting locale, seemingly completely out of place within the surrounding tunnels and caves of Undermountain. It had at least two canopies, the larger of which stood over 80 feet tall (24.4 meters). The second, somewhat smaller canopy was more dense however, comprising a mix of both deciduous and coniferous species of temperate trees. Fruiting bushes, shrubs, and flowering plants could be commonly found. [[Rose]]s were notably exempted from this selection as their presence displeased Wyllow. \n\nThe forest floor was sporadically littered with rusted weapons, damaged armor, empty bottles, and other items that had been left by adventurers that had journeyed through, and occasionally died within, Wyllowwood. For every humanoid that was killed by Wyllow's hands, she crafted a small, totemic doll and hung it from the branches of one of her trees.",
            "Caverns": "Beyond the forest was a series of natural caverns, Large portions of these caves were considered [[dead-magic zone]]s, where [[spell]]s and spell-like abilities ceased to function."
        },
        "Geography": {
            "Entrances": "During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of ways to enter Wyllowwood existed, although none were immediately apparent:\n* There was a magical gate hidden behind a wooden door in the basement of [[Twice as Nice]], a shop off the [[Street of Lances]] in the [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. The gate inflicted a poisonous disease on anyone who passed through it.\n* In the basement of [[Builders' Hall]], the guildhall of the [[Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters &amp; Tile-makers]],, in the [[South Ward of Waterdeep|South Ward]] of Waterdeep, two statues of dancing figures acted as a gate to [[Trobiand's Graveyard]]. A person needed skip between the statues and focus on Undermountain in order to be transported.\n* A large stone urn in the northeast corner of [[Heroes' Garden]] in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep linked to a pool near the edge of the underground forest in Wyllowwood. The urn needed to be more than half full of water to function, and anyone being transported ran the risk of being affected by one of a number of magical conditions at random.\n* There existed an area of dead trees about three miles (4.8 kilometers) to the east of Waterdeep's [[East Torch Tower]]. The largest tree had a hollow trunk, and if a person stood on their left leg inside the hollow trunk, they would be transported to Wyllowwood,\n* There was a pair of stone arches near [[Seaeye's March]] near the [[Gulf Leap]], 100 yards (90 meters) south of the [[Field of Triumph]] in Waterdeep. Anyone who walked between the arches when the full [[Selûne (moon)|moon]] was shining on them was transported to Wyllowwood, but all their potions were stripped from their possession and ''[[faerie fire]]'' was cast upon them. If, however, the moon disappeared behind a cloud ''during'' the transportation, the person ended up being transported to a random position within Undermountain.\n* There was a circle of standing stones north of Waterdeep. If an individual walked inside the circle while clouds cast a shadow over them, they were transported to a random location within Wyllowwood's underground forest.\n* There was an old [[elven]] tune etched near the ceiling between two pale blue columns in the [[House of Song]], the guildhall of the [[Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, and Choristers]], in the [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep|Trade Ward]] of Waterdeep. If this song was played, a gate opened between the columns and transported those who stepped through it into the river in Wyllowwood.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]], a number of other entrances to Wyllowwood opened up:\n* The River of the Depths could be traversed from the Twisted Caverns.",
            "Notable Locations": {
                "Caverns of Doom": ": This cave complex in the northern tunnels of Wyllowwood served as the home of [[Rafiqa]], a [[marid]] [[mage]] who took a liking to this level of Undermountain. It was naturally brightened by luminous [[lichen]] that grew on the cavern's walls. The entrance to Rafiqa's lair was protected by a number of subterranean [[giant lizard]]s.",
                "Dragon's platform": ": A giant stone platform, covered in moss and ivy, was built atop a massive mound of earth and rock that overlooked the subterranean River of the Depths. It was 70 feet long (21.3 meters), 50 feet wide (15.2 meters), stood 10 feet tall (3 meters), and extended east into a stone bridge that spanned the river, 30 feet (9.1 meters) above its waters. From the west of the platform, 20-feet-tall (6.1 meters) marble columns held up a stone walkway that continued northwest to a number of guardhouses and eventually, [[Wyllow's Tower]]. By the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], many of these columns had crumbled away.{{Waterdeep-time}}\n\n: A crumbling stone building stood 15 feet (4.6 meters) tall atop the platform, looking over the River of the Depths. After they were banished from this level of Undermountain, the building was claimed by the young [[green dragon]] [[Valdemar]] as its lair. While it previously held a small cache of wealth kept by the priests, it was subsequently used to store the vast treasure accumulated by the dragon throughout the years.",

        "Inhabitants": {
            "Creatures": "Several natural and magical creatures lived within the forest of Wyllowwood; many of them, along with a great number of trees, had been ''awakened'' by [[magic]] and granted sentient intelligence. porcupines, [[warthog]]s, skunks, [[black bear|black]] and [[brown bear]]s, and [[elk]]s as well as [[giant wasp]]s and [[giant bat]]s. \n\nHowever, it also served as home to colonies of goblin werebats, groups of cohabiting [[ettercap]]s and [[giant spider]]s, [[basilisk]]s, [[will-o'-wisp]]s, and [[cloaker]]s. A group of minotaurs formed their lair within one of Wyllowwood's caverns that was considered a dead-magic area.\n\nA number of [[:Category:Fungi|fungi]] and [[undead]] creatures dwelled within the caverns of Wyllowwood beyond the forest proper. [[Stone pudding]]s, [[death mold]]s, [[brown mold]]s, and [[heucuva]] made their home in the more barren areas of this level of Undermountain.",
            "Aquatic Life": "The portion of the River of the Depths that passed through Wyllowwood was rich with sea life, including a number of [[lemon fish]]es,\n\nA group of [[scrag|freshwater scrag]]s also made their home beneath the River of the Depths and stored their cache of [[quartz]], [[sardonyx]], and other valuable [[:category:gem stones|gemstones]] in the waters beneath the Platform of Doom. A coven of [[sea hag]]s ventured into Undermountain in the 14{{th}} century and lived upon the subterranean river bed and managed to survive encounters with several of Halaster's apprentices, though they lost their magical gaze at the hands of Arcturia.",
            "Followers of Malar": "Wyllowwood attracted many worshipers of the deity [[Malar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], as the subterranean forest was quite private. They conducted their [[High Hunt]]s within its woods and the winner was determined by whomever collected the most shields and skulls within a single month.",
            "Dragon": "This ally was Valdemar, a young green dragon that originally encountered Wyllow under antagonistic circumstances. Upon discovering Valdemar within her domain, the elven druid contacted a band of adventurers to combat the beast and turn it away. During the battle, Valdemar received a nearly-lethal injury by means of an [[Intelligent item|intelligent]] [[sword]] that greatly changed their perspective and caused a shift in their general [[alignment]]. Following this event, Wyllow reconsidered the relationship she could have had with Valdemar and found a place for it within Wyllowwood's ecosystem, and thereafter the two enjoyed a peaceful and mutually beneficial coexistence."
        },
        "History": "Before it was known as Wyllowwood, the caverns of this domain were partly inhabited by a group of Talosian priests, who established their temple on a small island. When Halaster's apprentices came to this level they leveled the followers of the Destroyer and the temple was abandoned. All that remained was the undead horde the zealous [[cleric]]s had raised in an effort to increase their power.\n\nSometime during the 13{{th}} century, Halaster's apprentice [[Yinark]] met the [[moon elf]] Wyllow while he was away from Undermountain. The two fell in love and they joyously returned together to Yinark's home, deep beneath the city of Waterdeep. However, Wyllow was crestfallen when she saw that the dungeon that her beloved called home was so vastly different from the woods she called home. Determined to keep Yinark and his new love content, and prevent them from leaving Undermountain, Halaster used multiple castings of the spell ''[[wish]]'' to create Wyllowwood—a subterranean domain of nature, named after and crafted for a single individual.\n\nAt some point, a group of adventurers ventured into Wyllowwood and were ambushed by Yinark. One of these travelers was a [[fighter|warrior]] who carried with them the [[emerald]] [[blade]] called ''[[Tearulai]]''. Halaster's apprentice managed to slay all bar two of the interlopers but the act of violence set him upon a path of increasingly [[evil]] disposition. The story of this battle and the subsequent hiding of the sword by Halaster himself was ''[[stone shape|inscribed]]'' into a large stone that sat in a clearing northwest of Wyllow's Tower.\n\nHowever grand as Wyllowwood was, its serene environment was not enough to ease Yinark's obsession and Wyllow's growing lethargy. Eventually Wyllow became quite close with her friend Crissann, a human [[wizard]]ess who lived as a mercenary, and the two seemed to form a budding romance. Before they could explore a life as lovers, however, Halaster interceded and turned Crissann against Wyllow in an effort to assuage Yinark's jealousy. Wyllow slew her former friend with the aid of the creatures of her forest and swore to never let another living being sway her heart.\n\nEventually, Yinark outright forbade Wyllow from returning to her home on the surface and she was completely overwhelmed with despair. Their relationship had become so acrimonious, this final act led to a violent outburst and the two fought each other in a vicious spell-battle. Wyllow slew her former husband. As she was left completely despondent and wracked with guilt, with no love left in her life, Wyllow remained within her domain as per Yinark's final wishes.\n\nDuring the early 14{{th}} century, the elf Sirane went to drink some water in Heroes' Garden when she was accidentally transported to Undermountain. She was confronted by Arcturia and turned to stone. Her petrified form was taken to Wyllowwood, where it remained for at least 40 years."
