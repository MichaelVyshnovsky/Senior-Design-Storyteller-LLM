'''Slitherswamp''' was the 8{{th}} level of [[Undermountain]], previously one of the sub-levels of area that came to be known as the [[Twisted Caverns]]. It was a series of fetid caverns that were infested with a variety of [[serpentfolk]] and other semi-aquatic races, including [[yuan-ti]], [[naga]]s and [[bullywug]]s.

==Description==
The muck-filled caverns of Slitherswamp were wholly unpleasant. Many caves and passageways were covered in thick mud, if they were not nearly flooded. The heat and humidity of the swamp caused the cavern walls to drip with moisture.

==Geography==
===Entrances===
* A tunnel in the north-west part of the swamp came down from [[Maddgoth's Castle]]. It opened up into a cavern, about 20' (6.1 m) above its floor.

===Notable Locations===

===Exits===
The following ways could be used to leave Slitherswamp:
* A tunnel in the south-west part of this down to level 9, Dweomercore.
* An archgate in a three-fork 5-meter-high cave and a mirror gate to [[Murial's Gauntlet]].
* A standing gate to level 11, the [[Troglodyte Warrens]].

==Inhabitants==
Due to Slitherswamp's unique formation, along with much larger amphibians such as [[giant frog]]s. 

All sorts of vegetation were alive within the caves of Slitherswamp. Some notable flora included the luminescent ferns that grew out from the muddy ground, and even aggressive [[shambling mound]]s.

;[[Ssethian Scourges]]:
: These were three spirit nagas who once fought the [[yuan-ti]] on this level, eventually emerging victorious. The nagas maintained a stable of thralls, controlling them with a ''[[rod of rulership]].''

;[[The Blacktongues]]:
: Sent in by Halaster Blackcloak, this bullywug tribe acted quickly, enslaving four [[carrion crawler]]s and a [[hydra]]. The death slaad king's control gem was kept on level 9, [[Dweomercore]], and Halaster Blackcloak forced the slaad to rule over the bullywugs.

;Karstis of Dweomercore:
: The [[wizard|mages]] on level 9, Dweomercore, had sent a spy of their own, a [[mage]] named [[Karstis.]]

==History==
Originally a sub-level located beneath the [[Farm Level]], its water-filled caves  were not physically connected to any other part of Undermountain. Rather, it was connected by ''[[portal]]s'' to the [[Serpent Hills]] and [[High Forest]]. Flora, fauna, fresh air, heat in the summer and cold in the winter, all came from [[Faer√ªn]] through these portals into the domain. Over time though, the water and organic materials that entered the sub-level turned the environment into a swamp. 

Sometime around the [[1295 DR|Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]] brought hundreds of snakes and serpentine monsters into the swamp to experiment on. Save for those creatures he took for his experiments, Halaster left the swamp and it's inhabitants alone sealed away from the rest of Undermountain. 

In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], a concerted effort by the swamp's increasingly numerous inhabitants broke through the defenses of the High Forest ''portal'' and half of Slitherswamp's population escaped. Around 30 nagas and approximately a dozen ssvaklors ruthlessly kept the population of serpentfolk relatively small and ruled over them. In the following years, physical routes to the surrounding levels were cut, appeared, or formed, and the serpentfolk apparently built a collection of temples dedicated to [[evil]] yuan-ti [[gods]]. 

In the [[1491 DR|Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the yuan-ti who worshiped at the temples were wiped out by a trio of [[spirit naga]]s. In light of this event, Halaster brought in a bullywug tribe, known as the Blacktongues to take control of the Slitherswamp, and installed a cruel [[death slaad]] [[Kuketh]], whom he controlled, to govern them.
