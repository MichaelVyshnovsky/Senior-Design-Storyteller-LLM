        "The Leopard Men": "{{Canon|adap}}\n: ''By [[David Howery]], illustrated by [[Lucy Synk]], Cartography by [[Diesel]].'' '''p. 13-27'''\nThe wicked Leopard Men might have loads of treasure - but no one has ever met one and lived to talk about it. A 14-page AD&D adventure for a party of 5-7 characters totaling 54 levels. In a land of untamed jungles the PCs are hired by the wealthiest merchant of a trading outpost fort to put an end to a local cult that is preventing him from establishing a trade route with a local tribe.\n\nOriginally derived from a home-campaign set on [[Oerth]], this setting neutral adventure can be adapted to the ''Forgotten Realms'' setting, with the adventure location replaced with [[Chult]]. Notably, this adventure frequently references the ''[[Wilderness Survival Guide]]'' and utilizes monster statistics from [[Dragon magazine 122|''Dragon'' #122]]'s articles \"Gaming the Dark Continent\" and \"Out of Africa\".  {{Dusup|22/The Leopard Men}}\n322iruddd6otte0rhs71iwwxpcsv7sh"
