        "mainbody": "he Causeway was a narrow land bridge that connected the main gate of Stardeep to the Yuirwood, across a planar boundary.{{cite book/Stardeep|144|12}} Cynosure could open or close the causeway, causing it to dissolve into mist and closing the portal.{{cite book/Stardeep|104-106|9}} Without Cynosure, only both keepers could open or close the Causeway.{{cite book/Stardeep|187|17}} On the Yuirwood, the Causeway was flanked by two obelisks. When open, the causeway extended all the way to the gates.{{cite book/Stardeep|138-139|11}}\n\nA message was engraved around the gates, translated to multiple languages. Behind the gates on the Causeway lay the Grand Vestibule.{{cite book/Stardeep|104-105|9}} Behind the gate there was also a guardhouse with an iron door, and a lever that withdrew the floor of the corridor connecting the Inner and Outer Bastions just outside the guardhouse, dropping intruders into the Underdungeon.{{cite book/Stardeep|160-161|14}}\n\n====Parade Hall====\nThe Parade Hall was used for combat drills and practice for the Empyrean Knights. It was just outside the barracks; to the west it held the many doors of the stables, while a high archway to the south marked the passage into the corridors of the Outer Bastion. A ramp providing access to the [[Underdungeon]] lay east.",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "Stardeep was created by the [[star elves]] as a prison for the [[Carnis|Traitor]] and to guard against the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] and the city of [[Xxiphu]], sometime in the 4{{th}} century DR.{{cite book/Stardeep|12|1}}{{cite book/Stardeep|213|19}}{{cite book/Stardeep|301|28}} Early in its history, it was staffed by such [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] as [[Tardoun]].",
            "Nangulis Incident": "Sometime around {{yearlink|1363}}, the Traitor made one of his most successful bids for escape. The local Keepers, [[Nangulis]] of the Inner Bastion and [[Kiril Duskmourn]] of the Outer Bastion, resorted to a desperate plan: Nangulis sacrificed his soul to create a powerful blade, [[Angul]], which Kiril wielded against the Traitor, forcing him back into imprisonment and weakening him considerably.\n\nIn the aftermath, Nangulis' Cerulean Sign was left to Captain Brathtar,{{cite book/Stardeep|174|16}} while the sword ''Angul'' remained in the keeping of the steward of the Outer Bastion, Kiril. however, the intelligent sword proved too dominating for Kiril to handle. After Angul twisted her into slaying several children who had wandered too close to Stardeep during a routine patrol, she fled her post.{{cite book/Stardeep|64-72|6}} After her escape, the post at the Inner Bastion was filled by [[Delphe]], while the Empyrean Knight [[Telarian]] was promoted to Keeper of the Inner Bastion. The unused remainder of [[Nangulis]]' soul was preserved by Cynosure in the Armory of Stardeep.",
            "Singing Chicken Incident": "During [[Delphe]]'s guardianship as the Keeper of the Inner Bastion, she received a report from Cynosure that a singing chicken had breached the Causeway and was headed straight for the gate. The chicken sang the [[King of Stars]] ballad. The incident turned out to be the construct's attempt at a joke, but it somewhat undermined the Keeper's trust for the defense system.{{cite book/Stardeep|4-5|1}}",
            "Telarian Incident": "The Traitor's next bid for freedom involved slowly corrupting the dreams of Keeper Telarian, an avid user of divination spells. Telarian, while under the high priest's influence, conceived of a plan where he would free the Traitor in order to prevent the future emergence of Xxiphu. This plan involved creating a sword, ''[[Nis]]'', such that it could be merged with ''Angul'' to create a weapon capable of destroying the Traitor's wards.{{cite book/Stardeep|176-177|16}}\n\nAfter Kiril returned to Stardeep, Telarian tricked her, combined the weapons, and then used the combined blades to shatter the wards keeping the Traitor imprisoned. The sword was so powerful he easily destroyed one of the main bodies of [[Cynosure (construct)]], and nearly struck down his fellow keeper, Delphe.{{cite book/Stardeep|287-289|28}} Though he came very close, Gage turned on him at the last minute, and struck him down; Kiril's influence convinced the artifact to separate back into its component swords, and ''Nis'' lost its enchantment soon after. Telarian fell from the Throat into the Well, his attempt thwarted.{{cite book/Stardeep|298-303|28}} The monk [[Raidon Kane]] helped rebuild the wards afterwards, and Kiril reclaimed her weapon, ''Angul''.{{cite book/Stardeep|308_311|29}}",
            "Spellplague Incident": "The death of [[Mystra]] in {{yearlink|1385}} caused [[Spellplague|extreme ripples]] in the [[Weave]], inducing massive failures throughout the systems in Stardeep.{{cite book/Plague of Spells||}} The Traitor was able to escape the prison; fortunately, he did not make it too far, as a powerful tree spirit, a [[Forest Monarch]], captured him. By sacrificing itself, the tree spirit petrified itself alongside the Traitor, killing him in the process.{{cite book/Key of Stars||11}} Stardeep itself collapsed into the [[Feywild]] alongside [[SildÃ«yuir]], becoming a pocket realm within.{{cite book/Key of Stars||12}}"
