        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the wide variety of fungi, a number of species of creatures native to the depths [[Underdark]] could be found within the Twisted Caverns. A tribe of [[Kuo-toa]] formed their nesting caves within a small, subterranean lake that was fed by the River of the Depths.<ref name =\"WDMM-p59\"> Other creatures of the caverns included bats, [[ettin]]s, [[troglodyte]]s, [[piercer]]s, [[giant spider]]s, [[hook horror]]s,<ref name =\"WDMM-p68\"> [[darkmantle]]s,<ref name =\"WDMM-p65\"/> driders and even a single, particularly cruel [[quasit]].\n\nAn [[aboleth]] referred to as [[Illuun]] made its lair in the flooded cavern that was previously inhabited by kuo-toa. Its mere presence tainted the water and killed the schools of fish that sustained the fish-like [[humanoid]]s. The [[aberrant]] monstrosity was accompanied by its pet [[chuul]]s and enslaved [[troglodytes]].",
        "History": "Sometime during the 15{{th}} century, the [[mage]] [[Darribeth Meltimer]] went mad  after she encountered a demonic force within the Underdark. After her descent into madness, she took refuge within a cave in the Twisted Caverns. She was tormented by the quasit she referred to as \"Teeha\", who often transformed itself into a toad that offered Darribeth false means of escape.\n\nAfter they descended down from [[Stromkuhldur]], [[drow]] from [[House Auvryndar]] established an outpost within the Twisted Caverns. They were led by the [[priest]]ess of [[Lolth]] [[Melith Auvryndar]] and her consort [[Thirza Helviiryn]].\n\nSome time around the [[1492 DR|Year of the Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], a [[green slaad]] was let loose within the caverns after its ''[[control gem]]'' was stolen by the [[Halaster Blackcloak|\"Mad Mage\"]]. While in the caverns, the aberrant shape-changer took the form of a [[human]] and referred to himself as [[The Alchemist]]. He spent his time bargaining for [[material component]]s in order to brew his [[potion]]s, all while searching for his lost ''control gem''.\n\nThe kuo-toa tribe that previously lived around the lake within the Grotto of Madness were driven out by the aboleth Illuun by the [[1493 DR|Year of the Purple Dragons, 1493 DR]]."
