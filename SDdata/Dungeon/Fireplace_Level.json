        "Structure": {
            "Entrances & Exits": "There were three physical passages through the ''walls of force'', each {{SI|5|ft}} wide and about {{SI|12|ft}} high, warded on the Ethereal plane against ghosts. On the Ethereal plane, the gaps were {{SI|10|ft}} wide. The northernmost passage was a long stone staircase without handrails that led up to the basement of the Gost villa. It was guarded by the floating ''[[permanent image]]'' of a stern human male face about {{SI|6|ft}} tall that bellowed a warning to anyone that approached it. The face was recognizable as that of [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]], although he had no part in its creation. It was placed here by the patriarch of the Gost family in the {{YearlinkName|1308}}, to frighten off possible intruders to their villa when they sealed up and abandoned the place. All records of this staircase were expunged and it was eventually forgotten by surface-dwellers. Artor Morlin made certain it stayed forgotten while he was in residence.\n{{Fq|text=Turn back, whoever you are! Trespass in this area is prohibited!|source=Warning shouted by the visage of the Blackstaff.|width=290px}}\n\nPassing through the floating visage tripped one of two traps unless the transgressor was bearing the badge of House Gost. The first was a ''[[forcecage]]'' that surrounded the victim and then ''[[summon monster|summoned]]'' a [[hamatula]] into the ''forcecage'' with them. The second trap attempted to place ''[[feeblemind]]'' on the victim and then cast them into a ''[[maze]]''.\n\nAbout {{SI|50|ft}} to the west (as the [[xorn]] flies) was another staircase that connected an old storeroom to the [[Grinning Lion#Stairs of the Lion|Stairs of the Lion]] beneath the Grinning Lion tavern. The stairs were concealed behind a secret door in the west wall of the storeroom, then turned north and ascended at least {{SI|70|ft}} of vertical distance. At some point the stairs turned east and emerged under the bottom three steps of the Stairs of the Lion, which served as a trapdoor. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Unger Farshal]], the proprietor of the Grinning Lion, used this passage to get to the Dungeon of the Crypt and then down to [[Skullport]] where he procured drugs such as [[mordayn]] powder to sell in Waterdeep.\n\nThe third entrance to the complex was in the southeast corner where a {{SI|40|ft}} east-west corridor led to a ''[[portal]]'' the Gosts used for smuggling various beasts into Waterdeep from the [[Wormwrithings]] northeast of [[Blingdenstone]]. This corridor ended in what appeared to be a stone-filled archway but was in fact not a bricked-up arch but the ''portal''.\n\nThe walls and ceiling of the passage bulged outwards and the stone masonry was cracked and crushed where a [[purple worm]] came through the ''portal'' and was caught in the ''[[temporal stasis]]'' trap triggered by the large symbol of House Gost engraved in the floor. The Company of Crazed Venturers discovered the frozen beast in the {{YearlinkName|1341}}, while pursuing Artor Morlin up the flue of a fireplace in the Dungeon of the Crypt. The sudden appearance of a gargantuan creature in a space too small to accommodate it had opened up a fissure (big enough for a medium-sized creature to squeeze through) that connected the hall of shattered stone to the flue. After exploring this new discovery, they managed to remove the suspended purple worm and then Khelben cast ''[[gate seal]]'' on the portal \"for the security of the city\" before the Company returned to the surface. Despite the ''seal'', any magic used or cast in the hallway partially activated the ''portal'', as evidenced by a silvery shimmer in the archway. This alerted a pair of giant [[portal drake]]s that laired on the other side and could ''portal jump'' into the corridor while the ''portal'' was active.\n\nSomewhere in this complex was the original ''portal'' to the southern [[Forlorn Hills]] that the Gosts used to quickly transport goods to the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], or perhaps it was part of a network that included the Wormwrithings ''portal''.",
            "Unger Farshal's Storeroom": "This {{SIAdj|30|ft|adj=square}} room connected to the stair under the Stairs of the Lion via a secret door in the west wall. In the north wall was a small door to another storeroom and in the center of the south wall was a steel-reinforced oak door that bore the Gost insignia.The source describes this as the head of a fallen [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep|Walking Statue of Waterdeep]], but as of 1372 DR no known statue had fallen and the scale of the artifact is too small, considering that the entire shop and residence of [[Thort's Findings]] fit inside the head of [[The Swordmaiden]] (see ''[[Waterdeep: Dragon Heist]]'', p. 184). Against the west wall, next to the secret entrance, Unger had an old wooden table and chair where he sometimes parceled out the mordayn powder into packets for individual sale.\n\nThrough the south door was a {{SIAdj|50|ft}} passage that ended in another door. Through this door was a {{SIAdj|35|ft}} by {{SIAdj|30|ft}} storage room with exits to the south and east. At the halfway point of the passage was a {{SIAdj|10|ft}} alcove to the east and another door.",
            "Chamber of the Beast Cages": "The alcove door opened into a long, {{SIAdj|90|ft}} by {{SIAdj|30|ft}} hall with a rounded ceiling. Down the center of the room were five cages, each {{SIAdj|10|ft|adj=square}} and {{SI|5|ft}} apart, with walls that reached from floor to ceiling and a {{SIAdj|5|ft}} door facing south. In the far northeast corner was large pile of coal more than {{SI|20|ft}} high that emitted a soft glow of burning embers.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|85}} Exits to the room included double doors in the north and south walls.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|81}}\n[[File:Dungeon128-Gundwynd Ghosts-du Lac-Udon-Sinclair-Ferriere.png|thumb|center|600px|''The Gundwynd ghosts attempting to negotiate their way out of the Fireplace level.'']]\n\nThe other four cages were the home of the [[Gundwynd]] ghosts. When they were not roaming about, they could be seen moaning or rattling the bars in the cage where they died, still dressed in noble-born finery. They wanted nothing but revenge on the descendants of Lord [[Geldirth Gost II]] and attempted to barter with any living person that was not immediately hostile. They knew the location of Artor's coffin on the Ethereal plane and offered to temporarily possess the visitor and take them there. However, they did not negotiate in good faith. The only way the ghosts could escape from the Fireplace Level was by possessing a living creature that could pass through one of the ghostbane traps, and they would stop at nothing to get out and finally find peace in retribution on the Gosts. (Alternatively, if a living member of House Gost were brought before them, a ghost could win their eternal rest by slaying them.) If negotiations failed, they attacked in desperation, knowing that even if they were banished they would return in less than a [[tenday]].{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|90}}\n\nThe pile of coal was fodder for Bloodfire, the [[Nightmare_(creature)#Subraces|cauchemar nightmare]] steed that served Artor Morlin. The coals burned very slowly on the Ethereal plane. Bloodfire roamed the Fireplace Level when not eating here or carrying Artor someplace.\n\nThe south door of this grand hall opened into a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} passageway that connected to the central hallway.",
            "Central Hallway": "This east-west corridor was {{SI|80|ft}} long with doors at both ends and a door on the south wall at the midpoint. Diagonally across from the south door was the passage to the Chamber of the Beast Cages. The western door connected to the storeroom that was south of Unger Farshal's Storeroom. The southern door opened onto a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} passage to another door and the [[Fireplace Level#Chamber of the Chalice|Chamber of the Chalice]] (see below). The east door led to a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} by {{SIAdj|35|ft}} storage room that (in 1372 DR) was a prison for a [[blood fiend]].",
            "Blood Fiend Prison": "The blood fiend trapped in this room was another of Artor Morlin's menagerie of vampiric creatures. It was contained in this room by a ''hedged prison'' version of a ''binding'' spell. Thrown in with it was a [[dretch]] that the blood fiend played with (that is, viciously tortured) for fun and blood. The room was barren and the floor was covered in a thick layer of dust. Dark stains could be seen in places.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|78}} In the southwest corner of the room was a door to a small {{SIAdj|20|ft}} by {{SIAdj|15|ft}} storage room. The south wall was interrupted by a {{SIAdj|45|ft}} corridor that led to another storage room that connected to the Wormwrithings hall and fireplace flue.",

Above the pedestal floated a gem-encrusted chalice to entice would-be thieves. This trap was placed here by the Gost family and Artor Morlin let it stand for his amusement. The pedestal, chalice, and ceiling were all part of a ''[[permanent image]]'' that triggered the trap if any of them were touched. Above the illusory ceiling was a ''wall of force'' that held huge [[gold]] ingots that were formed by a ''[[major creation]]'' spell and replenished when they dissolved. Touching the illusion temporarily made the ''wall of force'' vanish and the massive gold bricks then fell on everyone in the room with devastating effect. When the gold vanished, the trap reset.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|79}}\n\nThe double door in the north wall of this room accessed a short passage to the central hallway. There were single doors in the center of the other three walls. To the east was a passage that turned south and connected to the same storage room as the corridor south of the blood fiend prison. The west door opened into a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} corridor and a door to the Hall of Gibbering Madness. To the south was another {{SIAdj|30|ft}} by {{SIAdj|25|ft}} storage room.",
            "Hall of Gibbering Madness": "This {{SIAdj|40|ft}} by {{SIAdj|35|ft}} room was accessible through a door in the northeast corner that led to the Chamber of the Chalice, or by a door in the center of the north wall that opened on a {{SIAdj|25|ft}} corridor that connected to the storage room south of Unger Farshal's storeroom. In 1372 DR, the floor of this old storage room was a sand pit with the consistency of [[quicksand]]. On the south wall was a door to another small storage room.\n\nThis room was the home of a large vampiric [[gibbering mouther]] that Artor captured during [[Halaster's Higharvestide]]. Artor somehow ascertained that the creature had been turned into a vampire by the will of [[Ghaunadaur]] while it dwelled in the [[Caverns of Ooze]], so he added it to his collection of creatures to study and named it the [[Blood of Ghaunadaur]]. The creature gibbered at the first sign of life it detected, causing ''[[confusion]]'', and attacked. It could transform itself into an [[ooze]], summon other oozes to its aid, spit [[acid]]ic saliva, turn the ground to quicksand, and swallow beings whole. The sandpit in this room was the Blood of Ghaunadaur's coffin.",
            "Chamber of the Pool": "[[File:Dungeon128-Arrick Kaarvol-du Lac-Udon-Sinclair-Ferriere.png|thumb|right|270px|''Arrick Kaarvol wielding a trident.'']]\nThis {{SIAdj|70|ft|adj=square}} chamber was behind the big double doors in the north wall of the [[Fireplace Level#Chamber of the Beast Cages|Chamber of the Beast Cages]]. In 1372 DR, it was filled with dirty water that was nearly opaque. Rainwater drained here through various pipes and an overflow drain to the [[Underdark]] kept the level constant. The south door opened onto a {{SIAdj|15|ft|adj=wide}} landing above the waterline. On the opposite wall was another such landing, {{SI|10|ft}} wide, that bisected a stone staircase that led down into the water and up to the Gost villa (warded by the image of Khelben Arunsun). The ceiling was nearly {{SI|40|ft}} high and the water was deep enough to hide seven [[giant clam]] shells from all but the very perceptive.\n\nThis cavernous room was the home of another of Artor's spawn, [[Arrick Kaarvol]], a formidable merman and priest of [[Umberlee]], and his six [[merfolk]] vampire spawn. The giant clam shells served as coffins for this pod of bloodthirsty undead. Arrick kept the room warded with ''[[unhallow]]'' specifically tuned to ''[[Protection from energy|protection from electricity]]''. Arrick was charged with keeping trespassers from finding and entering either of the two ''portals'' in this room.\n\nThe first ''portal'' was a silvery shimmering curtain below the waterline about {{SI|10|ft}} from the east wall, facing west. The curtain was of sufficient size to allow a large creature to pass, but deactivated for eighteen seconds each time a single creature went through. The curtain was a two-way ''portal'' to the Ethereal plane and the primary way Artor Morlin traveled to and from his coffin. The other ''portal'' was an innocuous stone archway that was filled in with bricks located in the southwest corner of the room. The key to this one-way portal was Artor's double-bladed sword ''[[Shoonfangs]]'' and it took the bearer to the catacombs beneath [[Morlin Castle]] (ruins upon which [[Castle Daggerford]] was later built)—Artor's escape route of last resort.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|83}}",
            "Lair of the Blood Baron": "[[File:Dungeon128-Phase Spider-du Lac-Udon-Sinclair-Ferriere.png|thumb|right|270px|''A phase spider atop Artor Morlin's coffin on the Ethereal plane.'']]\nArtor Morlin's coffin was located on the Ethereal plane roughly in the southwest corner of the Hall of Gibbering Madness.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|88}}\n\nSuspended in the web with the coffin was one of three huge [[phase spider]]s that took turns guarding it—the other two lurked nearby.

        "History": "{{Main|Gost#History}}\nThe Fireplace Level was built in the {{YearlinkName|1219}}, by Lord [[Geldirth Gost]] to facilitate his scheme for moving goods via ''portal'' and outmaneuvering competitors, as well as smuggling and dealing in prohibited cargo. The ''portal'' network was expanded in the {{YearlinkName|1233}}, by Lord [[Harthar Gost]] to allow exotic beasts to be brought in for discerning clients. Problems with keeping the ''portal'' network secure led Lord Harthar to negotiate an arrangement with the Gundwynd clan to deliver goods via [[hippogriff]] when necessary. Harthar's son, Lord [[Geldirth Gost II|Geldirth II]], fell in with the [[Shadow Thieves]] and then betrayed the Gundwynds in the {{YearlinkName|1262}}, hiring assassins to kill or capture the entire family that resided in Waterdeep. He left the survivors of the raid to starve in the [[Fireplace Level#Chamber of the Beast Cages|Chamber of the Beast Cages]] but their ghosts came back for revenge. Desperate for protection, he traded his stake in the Shadow Thieves for the services of [[Marune|Marune the Masked]], a powerful [[necromancer]], who constructed the Ghost Cage.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1308}}, a purple worm bumbled through the Wormwrithings ''portal'' and was trapped in ''temporal stasis''—its bulk crushed and cracked the stone around the hallway, opening a fissure that connected to the flue of a fireplace down in the Dungeon of the Crypt. The Gosts abandoned their smuggling den, sealed up the entrance in the cellar of their villa, and expunged all evidence of its existence from the family records. At the time, Artor Morlin was the primary occupant of the Dungeon of the Crypt and used the flue as a way to reach the surface. He discovered the Fireplace Level and moved his coffin into it. In the {{YearlinkName|1341}}, the Company of Crazed Venturers attacked Morlin in the Dungeon of the Crypt and followed him up the flue to what they dubbed the Fireplace Level. Morlin escaped detection but the Company got help from [[Blackstaff Tower]] to turn the purple worm into solid [[silver]] and then transported it away (it appeared for a time as a two-story tall silver statue in the courtyard of the Company's tower on the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]]). Khelben himself sealed the ''portal'' that allowed the beast into the hallway.\n\nArtor Morlin unsealed the entrance to the Gost villa and took on the guise of Delinth Oberlin, the Gost family's seneschal. Over decades he earned the full trust of the Gosts and was able to keep a backup coffin in the cellar and prevent any discovery of it or the secret entrance to the Fireplace Level.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|86}} In addition, Morlin enthralled Lord [[Djarrus Gost]], patriarch of the family in the 1370s DR, and pushed him to become an anti-vampire crusader, feeding him information about rival vampires while safely hiding in plain sight.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|91}}"
