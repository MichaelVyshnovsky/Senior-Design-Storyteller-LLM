==Notes==
Man Forever borrows a lot from DC Comics Batman franchise. Agmoth is an anagram of Gotham; Samulbrar, Danik and Falder are Batman, Robin and Alfred respectively (Falder being an anagram of Alfred) and Samulbrar's heraldric emblem is a bat. When editing the article for continuity, [[George Krashos]] and [[Eric L. Boyd]] didn't notice these facts and merely changed some of the names to sound more Realmsian, but the fact was pointed out at a later date.
