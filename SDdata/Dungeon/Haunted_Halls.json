        "mainbody": "The Haunted Halls were a legendary dungeon located in Starwater Gorge, north of the town of Eveningstar in Cormyr. The entrance to the Halls was located on the western side of the gorge.\nThe Haunted Halls were built by dwarves for the human bandit lord Rivior sometime in the mid-1200s DR. Rivior was then slain by the Warrior-Queen Enchara of Esparin and the Halls were deserted for a time. Soon, the Halls became home to monsters and evil mages, followed quickly by adventurers.  The number of violent deaths in the former bandit hold led to a large number of undead and gave the place its name.\nThe Knights of Myth Drannor were famous for exploring the Halls in their forays in the mid-1300s DR."
