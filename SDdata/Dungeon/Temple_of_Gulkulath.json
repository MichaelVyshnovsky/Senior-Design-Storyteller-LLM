This corridor ended in a dead-end and people, whether dead or alive, who came within 30 feet (9 meters) of said dead-end were transported. At the wall of said dead-end were glowing letters, which were impossible to read from a distance further than 30 feet (9 meters) away. When ''[[detect magic]]'' was applied, the actual teleportation device did not register, whereas the letters did. It was also impossible to ''[[dispel magic|dispel]]'' or otherwise prevent the teleportation from occurring; this included the otherwise all-pervasive ban on teleportation in Undermountain. People saw blue light on teleporting and the light faded on arriving. This teleportation caused all lights to darken for two to five minutes on arrival.",

        "Structure": "The temple had two rooms and an alcove, which were connected via a winding corridor. The larger one in the north was submerged in [[water]] that was 2 feet (61 centimeters) deep. It sported a statue of Galkulath, which was actually one of a [[sahuagin]]. This statue's eyes, or holes that should represent eyes, could be made to glow by lighting a candle inside the removable head.\n\nThe alcove had a view slot to the north that allowed peeping for people who came through the corridor.\n\nThe corridor had three ends: one led to the exit and the one in the south ended in a dead-end. The western wall of this dead-end was cracked and out of these cracks clean water came out. This water ran through more cracks on the ground. The other end joined the second room where there was big heap of sand. In this sand, a priest once hid a [[scroll]] tube made of a tusk. The scrolls were for emergencies facing the cult to Gulkulath and were of the [[spell]]s ''[[command]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[speak with dead]]'', and ''[[cure serious wounds]]''.\n\nThe exit of the complex was in the south, east of the dead-end in the south. This exit did not always work as one. There was a falling wall that magically fell when a person did not pass within two minutes of the first person to exit the complex. The wall rose again when someone else teleported into the complex. This wall was not just immune to but actually reflected magic. It was also immune to any amount of physical damage it suffered from falling. However, it was possible to dig one's way out, not through, above, or below the wall, but around it. Naturally, tools were a requirement.",
        "Defenses": "The room with the statue was protected by two means. First, there was a [[giant gar]], simply put a giant fish that swallowed creatures in its vicinity. Second, there were three [[baneguard]]s who attacked any non-believers.",
        "History": "At some point before [[1371 DR]], a group of [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] nobles found the teleportation device and came up with a religious scam. They made up a deity called Gulkulath, Lord of the Northern Deeps. The goal was to create a cult of dockhands and sailors who would do whatever the nobles, who posed as cult leaders, wanted. It was not very clear how active, if at all, this cult was by 1371 DR. However, it was known that some leaders were part of a banished thieves' guild who wanted to re-integrate the criminal organization and that the cult suffered infighting that was detrimental to its success. As a result, the temple in Undermountain was practically abandoned.",
        "Inhabitants": "While not a real inhabitant, a cannibalistic [[orc]] bandit called [[Saurogh]] hid in the temple's alcove to kill and rob people to prove his courage and to gain money to even out debts."
