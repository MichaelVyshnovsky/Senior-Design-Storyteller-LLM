'''Maddgoth's Castle''' was the seventh level of [[Undermountain]]. It was named after a miniature, 1:12-scale fortress in one of its caverns. The castle served as a base of operations for a serial killer called [[Maddgoth]], who specialized in bringing home [[wizards]] and killing them. He was known to be very old, although it was unclear if he was an [[archmage]] who had prolonged his life with ''[[potions of longevity]]'' or a [[lich]]. Anyone who entered the castle shrank to one-twelfth their normal size.

==Inhabitants==
;Stone Giants: ''Circa'' [[1483 DR]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]] lured a family of [[stone giant]]s, and cursed them to remember nothing of their past lives and even anything that had happened over eight hours previously. They were unaware of the castle.

;[[Otto (dragon)|Otto]] the [[Faerie dragon|Faerie Dragon]]: A violet faerie dragon named Otto was drawn here by Halaster Blackcloak's [[magic]]. Upon its discovery of the tiny castle, it moved in, and never shrank, although it was still fairly comfortable inside.
