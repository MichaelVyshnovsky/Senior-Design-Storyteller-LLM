The castle served as a base of operations for a serial killer called [[Maddgoth]], who specialized in bringing home [[wizards]] and killing them. He was known to be very old, although it was unclear if he was an [[archmage]] who had prolonged his life with ''[[potions of longevity]]'' or a [[lich]].
