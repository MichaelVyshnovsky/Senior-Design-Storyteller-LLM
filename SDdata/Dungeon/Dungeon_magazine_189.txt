'''''Dungeon'' issue 189''' was released in April of 2011 in online format only. It contained the following articles related to the [[Forgotten Realms]]:

==[[Eye on the Realms]]: A Deadly Civic Honor==
: ''By [[Ed Greenwood]], illustrated by [[Wayne England]].'' '''p. 5-8'''
Disquiet has recently spread throughout [[Waterdeep]], however, as word has gotten out that some awards, decorations, and honors are haunted by unknown entities that compel the wearers to undertake dangerous, often illegal tasks—the sorts of daring deeds performed by adventurers. {{Dusup|190/Eye on the Realms: The Wild Lords}}
