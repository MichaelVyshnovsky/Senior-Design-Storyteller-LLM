The '''Troglodyte Warrens''' was a series of tunnels and cavernous chambers that made up the 11{{th}} level of the vast dungeon-complex known as [[Undermountain]].

==Geography==
===Entrances===
The following paths led to the Troglodyte Warrens:
* A cavernous pathway that extended down from [[Muiral's Gauntlet]] (''c.'' [[1492 DR]]).

===Notable Locations===
;Forest of Stone:
: This large, 20-feet-tall (6.1 meters) cavern was filled with stalactites and stalagmites that caused the chamber to resemble a forest made of stone trees. Above the stalagmites were glowing [[rune]]s imbued with [[transmutation]] magic that were harmless to [[humanoid]]s but caused perverse mutations among [[troll]]s.

Two particularly long stalagmites had their points chiseled away and were crowned with a lintel stone. Chiseled into this stone were the words "DON THE CRYSTAL CROWN" in [[Dwarvish]]. These [[elder rune]]s could be activated by the crystal crown of [[Melair|King Melair I]].

===Exits===
* A tunnel leading down to the Maze Level (''c.'' 1492 DR).
* The temporary, two-way ''[[portal]]'' that opened up to the [[Slitherswamp]].

==Inhabitants==
As the name suggested, troglodytes were the predominant species living within the Warrens.

While the primary denizens were the tribes of namesake troglodytes that skulked its caverns, the Warrens were home to a number of other deep-dwelling creatures such as [[stirge]]s, [[piercer]]s, and clans of trolls. One such clan wandered too close to the Forest of Stone; this left them horribly mutated, disfigured, and, in the case of [[Xlorp|one troll]], [[magic]]ally transformed into a [[svirfneblin]].

One stretch of the Warrens contained the lair of a monstrous [[behir]] that had been inscribed with [[arcane]] markings by the [[Halaster Blackcloak|Mad Mage]] himself.

==History==
During the 15{{th}} century, the Warrens were a battleground between the [[drow]] of [[House Auvryndar]], and those from [[House Freth]] who lived within [[Spiderwatch Keep]] in the Maze Level just below. During these years they shackled and enslaved many of the troglodytes, using them as thralls in their ever-growing feud.

Sometime before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], [[Kol'daan]] emerged as a leader among the troglodytes of the Warrens. He bravely guarded his kind from the pervasive threat of drow enslavement.
