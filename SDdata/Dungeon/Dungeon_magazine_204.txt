'''''Dungeon'' issue 204''' was released in July of 2012 in online format only. It contained the following articles related to the [[Forgotten Realms]]:

==Pearl of the Sea Mother==
: ''By [[John Rossomangno]], illustrated by [[Ben Wootten]], Cartography by [[Jason Engle]].'' '''p. 3-23'''
Madness can spread like a plague through [[kuo-toa]] settlements. Only their worship of entities with control over such insanity can hold off epidemics of lunacy. One such entity is [[Blibdoolpoolp]], the Sea Mother, who is frequently the object of the kuo-toas’ fanatical worship. Module for 2-5 PC's of level 15–17. {{Dusup|204/Pearl of the Sea Mother}}

==What’s Up in Downshadow==
: ''By [[Sterling Hershey]], illustrated by [[William O'Connor]], Cartography by [[Mike Schley]].'' '''p. 35-48'''
[[Downshadow]] is a vast cavern located in the top-most level of [[Undermountain]]. The area attracts the unwanted elements of [[Waterdeep]], so it’s a den for thieves and the downtrodden. Residents of [[Downshadow]] vanish sometimes, but a rash of disappearances can cause even the worst people to sit up and take notice. Module for 2-5 PC's of level 2-4.

==Denizens of the Demonweb==
: ''By [[Michael E. Shea]], illustrated by [[Ben Wootten]].'' '''p. 55-59'''
A void crisscrossed by ever-shifting webs, the abyssal layer of the [[Demonweb Pits|Demonweb]] is as twisted and deceptive as the plots spun by the [[Lolth|Queen of Spiders]] who rules there.
