'''''Dungeon'' issue 186''' was released in January of 2011 in online format only. It contained the following articles related to the [[Forgotten Realms]]:

==[[Eye on the Realms]]: Gergul and Mithgryn, Body Snatchers Extraordinaire==
: ''By [[Ed Greenwood]], illustrated by [[Eva Widermann]].'' '''p. 30-32'''
In recent months, necromancers, warlocks, alchemists, and others in the [[Heartlands]] who seek bodies and body parts have shared news of two human men who provide the needed ghastly remnants in return for coin. These men are said to be young, agile, armed, and alert for trouble and trade betrayals. {{Dusup|186/Eye on the Realms: Gergul and Mithgryn, Body Snatchers Extraordinaire}}

==Creature Incarnations: Modrons==
: ''By [[Greg Bilsland]] and [[Bruce Cordell]], illustrated by [[Craig J. Spearing]].'' '''p. 33-36'''
To be a [[modron]] is to be part of a strict hierarchy that is literally built into them. They are eternally vigilant against chaos and eternally at war against entropy. If you travel the planes of existence via portals, eventually you will meet them. {{Dusup|186/Creature Incarnations: Modrons}}
