            "Exits": "There were several known exits from the Caverns of Ooze:\n* A ''[[portal]]'' within the caverns led to [[Seadeeps]].\n* A ''portal'' among a pair of [[menhir]]s led to the [[Terminus Level]].\n* A blood-sipping ''portal'' led to the [[Maze Level]].\n* A tunnel excavated by a [[purple worm]] led to the [[Runestone Caverns]]."

The crew of the derelict ship, which included [[H'Catha]]n [[orog]]s, [[gray slaad]]i, and the [[mind flayer]] captain [[N'ghathrod]], were left to fend for themselves in the cave complex.",
        "Inhabitants": "Around [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the complex was inhabited by the [[marid]] [[Ichthyglug|Ichthyglug the Voluminous]] and the [[dao]] [[Jarûk|Jarûk the Prismatic]]. The two [[genie]]s had been imprisoned by Halaster in the dungeon and competed for freedom by attempting to rid the [[Runestone Caverns]] of the [[lich]] [[Ezzat]], who had set up residence there. According to Halaster's rules, the first to capture the lich's [[phylactery]] would be freed from the dungeon. They were not allowed to inflict bodily harm on each other."
