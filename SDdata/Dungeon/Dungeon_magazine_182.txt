'''''Dungeon'' issue 182''' was released in September of 2010 in online format only. It contained the following articles related to the [[Forgotten Realms]]:

==The Dreamheart==
: ''By [[Bruce R. Cordell]], illustrated by [[Kristina Carroll]].'' '''p. 27-30'''
This oblong chunk of stone appears unimpressive, but when viewed from the right location, it can be seen for what it is—an artifact of dreams, power, and endless possibilities. {{Dusup|182/The Dreamheart}}

==[[Eye on the Realms]]: The Dracohar==
: ''By [[Ed Greenwood]], illustrated by [[Wes Louie]].'' '''p. 66-68'''
"The Dread Hood" is a wily highwayman operating north of the [[Snakewood]], so-called because of the voluminous, black hood which perpetually shields his features. What hides beneath that hood? Perhaps it’s best if you don’t know. {{Dusup|182/Eye on the Realms: The Dracohar}}
