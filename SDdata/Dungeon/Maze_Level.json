The incessant sounds of crickets permeated some chambers of the cave-system, while the rattling of chains and [[illusory]] cries for help echoed throughout others.\n\nMany areas of the cavernous floors were shrouded in a dense fog that crept back even if it was dispersed. sometimes twisting into the ghostly faces of those who had died within Undermountain",

This 7'-tall (2.1 m) metal arachnid served its masters by blocking off sections of the caves with 6\"-thick (15.2 cm) cables that resembled the webs of a spider. While it could climb the walls and ceilings of the caverns, it was not used as a siege weapon, but rather to grant the drow greater control over their territory."

He wholeheartedly believed he was capable of summoning the demon lord Baphoment, attempting such a feat on numerous occasions. \n\nSometime before the [[1493 DR|Year of the Purple Dragons, 1493 DR]], Erelal Freth communed with [[Lolth]] in an effort to gain insight as to how she and her kin could prevent their foes in House Auvryndar from controlling the Troglodyte Warrens. She believed the key to this victory, and the control of Undermountain, lay with submission of the score of minotaurs that lived south of Spiderwatch Keep."
