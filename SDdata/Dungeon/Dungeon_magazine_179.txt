==The Splintered Spring==

A [[foulspawn]] [[monk]] controls a pack of [[phase spider]]s to attack nearby settlements.

==[[Eye on the Realms]]: Ondal's Stand==
: ''By [[Ed Greenwood]], illustrated by [[Sam Burley]].'' '''p. 65-67'''
Wizards beyond counting died in the [[Spellplague]]. What makes [[Ondal]] memorable is not his wizardry. He is remembered for the wine he’d bottled but hadn’t yet sold when the [[Spellplague]] struck. {{Dusup|179/Eye on the Realms: Ondal's Stand}}
