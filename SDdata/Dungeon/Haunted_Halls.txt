{{quote|''I think the Haunted Halls make as fine an old yarn as can be, told over an ale on a fine summer day. Whether ghosts walk the halls or treasure remains buried within? Well! Some soul would have to go there and find out. If you do take (sic) happen to find yourself across the bridge to Starwater Gorge and go in... come back and tell me what you've found. I'll make it worth your while.''|[[Alyn Farrago]]}}

==History==
The Haunted Halls were built by [[dwarves]] for the [[human]] bandit lord [[Rivior]] sometime in the mid-1200s [[DR]]. Rivior was then slain by the Warrior-Queen [[Enchara]] of [[Esparin]] and the Halls were deserted for a time. Soon, the Halls became home to monsters and evil [[mage]]s, followed quickly by adventurers.  The number of violent deaths in the former bandit hold led to a large number of [[undead]] and gave the place its name.<ref>

The [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] were famous for exploring the Halls in their forays in the mid-1300s DR.<ref name=VGtC-p142>
