In this epic adventure, the Winter Witch, a legendary [[Archfey]], has launched a campaign to send eternal winter cascading over large portions of the world. After a summons to [[Winterhaven]], the characters find a land locked in ice, and an old ally in need of aid. A trek to find a artifact known as the Sun's Sliver ensues, the only force potent enough to defeat the Winter Witch and banish her from the mortal world once more. Module for 3-5 PCs of level 22. {{Dusup|162/Winter of the Witch}}
