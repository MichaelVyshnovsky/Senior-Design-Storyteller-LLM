'''Stardeep''' was a small prison fortress sited in a small [[demiplane]] Stardeep was linked to [[Faerûn]] by a [[portal]] called the Causeway, appearing as a stone bridge over the [[Chabala Mere]], a tributary of the [[Chabala River]]. The most important prisoner was [[Carnis|The Traitor]],

==History==
===Early History===
Stardeep was created by the [[star elves]] as a prison for the [[Carnis|Traitor]] and to guard against the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] and the city of [[Xxiphu]], sometime in the 4{{th}} century DR.{{cite book/Stardeep|12|1}}{{cite book/Stardeep|213|19}}{{cite book/Stardeep|301|28}} Early in its history, it was staffed by such [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] as [[Tardoun]].

===Nangulis Incident===
Sometime around {{yearlink|1363}}, the Traitor made one of his most successful bids for escape. The local Keepers, [[Nangulis]] of the Inner Bastion and [[Kiril Duskmourn]] of the Outer Bastion, resorted to a desperate plan: Nangulis sacrificed his soul to create a powerful blade, [[Angul]], which Kiril wielded against the Traitor, forcing him back into imprisonment and weakening him considerably.

In the aftermath, Nangulis' Cerulean Sign was left to Captain Brathtar,{{cite book/Stardeep|174|16}} while the sword ''Angul'' remained in the keeping of the steward of the Outer Bastion, Kiril. however, the intelligent sword proved too dominating for Kiril to handle. After Angul twisted her into slaying several children who had wandered too close to Stardeep during a routine patrol, she fled her post.{{cite book/Stardeep|64-72|6}} After her escape, the post at the Inner Bastion was filled by [[Delphe]], while the Empyrean Knight [[Telarian]] was promoted to Keeper of the Inner Bastion. The unused remainder of [[Nangulis]]' soul was preserved by Cynosure in the Armory of Stardeep.

===Singing Chicken Incident===
During [[Delphe]]'s guardianship as the Keeper of the Inner Bastion, she received a report from Cynosure that a singing chicken had breached the Causeway and was headed straight for the gate. The chicken sang the [[King of Stars]] ballad. The incident turned out to be the construct's attempt at a joke, but it somewhat undermined the Keeper's trust for the defense system.{{cite book/Stardeep|4-5|1}}

===Telarian Incident===
The Traitor's next bid for freedom involved slowly corrupting the dreams of Keeper Telarian, an avid user of divination spells. Telarian, while under the high priest's influence, conceived of a plan where he would free the Traitor in order to prevent the future emergence of Xxiphu. This plan involved creating a sword, ''[[Nis]]'', such that it could be merged with ''Angul'' to create a weapon capable of destroying the Traitor's wards.{{cite book/Stardeep|176-177|16}}

After Kiril returned to Stardeep, Telarian tricked her, combined the weapons, and then used the combined blades to shatter the wards keeping the Traitor imprisoned. The sword was so powerful he easily destroyed one of the main bodies of [[Cynosure (construct)]], and nearly struck down his fellow keeper, Delphe.{{cite book/Stardeep|287-289|28}} Though he came very close, Gage turned on him at the last minute, and struck him down; Kiril's influence convinced the artifact to separate back into its component swords, and ''Nis'' lost its enchantment soon after. Telarian fell from the Throat into the Well, his attempt thwarted.{{cite book/Stardeep|298-303|28}} The monk [[Raidon Kane]] helped rebuild the wards afterwards, and Kiril reclaimed her weapon, ''Angul''.{{cite book/Stardeep|308_311|29}}

===Spellplague Incident===
The death of [[Mystra]] in {{yearlink|1385}} caused [[Spellplague|extreme ripples]] in the [[Weave]], inducing massive failures throughout the systems in Stardeep.{{cite book/Plague of Spells||}} The Traitor was able to escape the prison; fortunately, he did not make it too far, as a powerful tree spirit, a [[Forest Monarch]], captured him. By sacrificing itself, the tree spirit petrified itself alongside the Traitor, killing him in the process.{{cite book/Key of Stars||11}} Stardeep itself collapsed into the [[Feywild]] alongside [[Sildëyuir]], becoming a pocket realm within.{{cite book/Key of Stars||12}}

==Inhabitants==
Stardeep was normally inhabited by two star elven [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] and around two hundred [[Empyrean Knight]]s, as well as the sentient [[construct]] [[Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure]].

==Stardeep Rooms==
[[File:Stardeep cover, no text.png|alt="The Keeper stands on the edge of the Well, while a wicked construct looms behind her. Smoky tendrils crawl up the walls."|thumb|Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure and Delphe in the Chamber of Surveillance, looking down the Well.]]
===Inner Bastion===
====Chamber of Surveillance====
An instance of Cynosure, about {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} tall was positioned on the ceiling so that it was always looking into the Well. Cynosure could speak from a red disc above the statue itself.{{cite book/Stardeep|9-10|1}} The room was many-walled.{{cite book/Stardeep|291|28}}

====The Well====
The well's edges were covered in glyphs signifying normal functioning. At the bottom of the Well, the Traitor's handprints were still engraved since his last escape attempt around the year {{yearlink|1364}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|2-5|1}} The sides of the Well were reflective, and a spiral staircase of glass plates could be made to emerge or retract into the walls.{{cite book/Stardeep|302-303|28}}

====Cynosure Prime Chamber====
The doors to this chamber were carved with a white tree on a cerulean background. A low murmur of clicks, bangs and whistles emerged from the room. The chamber was filled with hulking rectangular objects, each covered with glowing script. Cords hung from the ceiling, connecting those rectangular stone forms. The cords all connected into Cynosure Prime's main body, a 30-foot tall statue of mixed materials. Its chest bore an unblemished Cerulean Sign.{{cite book/Stardeep|185_188|17}}

====Tardoun Hall====
Named after one of the first Keepers in the Fortress, Tardoun Hall was part of the common area of the Bastion. It had a frieze along both sides, depicting elves in a number of pursuits. There were doors leading to a lounge, baths, archives, a repository, Cynosure Prime's chamber, a dining hall, steep stairs leading down to the gate connecting both bastions, and past the stairs, Telarian's chambers.{{cite book/Stardeep|97|8}}{{cite book/Stardeep|185|17}}

====Armory====
The Armory was another hidden room in Stardeep, created by Keepers previous to Telarian and kept secret from all but Cynosure. The room contained a number of amenities, such as a furnace, forge, a magical fire, and high grade tools that could be used to forge magical weapons. Nangulis' leftover half-soul was kept there after he was used to craft ''[[Angul]]''; Telarian used Cynosure's aid to convert the other half of the decanted soul to ''[[Nis]]''.{{cite book/Stardeep|76-78|7}}{{cite book/Stardeep|208-209|19}}

====Other Passages====
From Cynosure Prime's chamber, there was a passage leading past a dining room to a set of marble stairs; at the end of the stairs lay the gate that connected the Inner and Outer Bastion, which had thick iron doors.{{cite book/Stardeep|189-190|17}}

===Outer Bastion===
====Epoch Chamber====
The Epoch Chamber was a spherical divination chamber built by the Keeper Telarian to focus his talents. Keeper Telarian had completed it a few months before Winter of {{yearlink|1375}}, possibly in {{yearlink|1374}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|74-75|7}}  just outside the limits of the Inner Bastion.
The ground wobbled on top of the liquid layer. It could only be accessed through teleportation,{{cite book/Stardeep|184|17}} usually by Cynosure.{{cite book/Stardeep|97-99|9}}

====War Room====
The War Room was used for planning. It contained a large oaken table for maps and figurines, and an unlighted balcony overlooking its floor.{{cite book/Stardeep|92-96|9}}

====Causeway====
{{fq
|text = ''This place is not a place of honor. No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.''<br>
''What is here is dangerous and repulsive. This message is a warning about danger.''<br>
''The danger is present in your time, as it was in ours.''<br>
''The danger is to the world, and it can erase all life, overwriting all with abomination.''<br>
''The danger may be unleashed if this place is disturbed. Shun this place. Turn around.''<br>

The Causeway was a narrow land bridge that connected the main gate of Stardeep to the Yuirwood, across a planar boundary.{{cite book/Stardeep|144|12}} Cynosure could open or close the causeway, causing it to dissolve into mist and closing the portal.{{cite book/Stardeep|104-106|9}} Without Cynosure, only both keepers could open or close the Causeway.{{cite book/Stardeep|187|17}} On the Yuirwood, the Causeway was flanked by two obelisks. When open, the causeway extended all the way to the gates.{{cite book/Stardeep|138-139|11}}

A message was engraved around the gates, translated to multiple languages. Behind the gates on the Causeway lay the Grand Vestibule.{{cite book/Stardeep|104-105|9}} Behind the gate there was also a guardhouse with an iron door, and a lever that withdrew the floor of the corridor connecting the Inner and Outer Bastions just outside the guardhouse, dropping intruders into the Underdungeon.{{cite book/Stardeep|160-161|14}}

====Parade Hall====
The Parade Hall was used for combat drills and practice for the Empyrean Knights. It was just outside the barracks; to the west it held the many doors of the stables, while a high archway to the south marked the passage into the corridors of the Outer Bastion. A ramp providing access to the [[Underdungeon]] lay east.
