        "History": "Seadeeps was originally the site of two of [[Clan Melairkyn]]'s main mining efforts. Its caverns were excavated by following the veins of [[mithral]] that extended westward under the floor of the [[Sea of Swords]].\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an illithid colony was established in Seadeeps, led by a [[ulitharid]] called [[Extremiton]]. The group had fled its main colony after a githyanki attack on the main colony deep in the [[Underdark]], following the instructions of its [[elder brain]]. Despite the relative security provided by the dungeon, the colony was under threat of extermination by the githyanki group living in the [[Crystal Labyrinth]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Extremiton and its mind flayer colony had plans to conquer Waterdeep. However, the city's vast population had made the ulitharid extremely curious. In order to better understand them, it built a series of [[psipod]]s in the level, devices that could imprison sentient creatures in a dream version of Waterdeep called [[Alterdeep]], crafted from information gathered telepathically from Waterdhavians' minds. The ulitharid then manifested itself in the illusion as any character it wished, although it showed a preference to appear as [[Durnan]].\n\nAt the same time, a githyanki strike force, commanded by the [[knight]] [[Yaveklar]], slowly opposed the mind flayers while awaiting reinforcements from the Crystal Labyrinth to conduct a final assault. In order to oppose the githyanki, the mind flayers bred a [[neothelid]], which they planned to unleash upon them on both levels.\n\nAdditionally, a cloister of [[flumph]]s inhabited a tall cavern on the outskirts of the level, feeding off the mind flayers' and githyanki's [[psionic]] energy from a safe distance. The githyanki slaughtered any flumphs they encountered on sight."
