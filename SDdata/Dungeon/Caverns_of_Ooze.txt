The '''Caverns of Ooze''' were the 7{{th}} main level, and 19{{th}} overall, of the [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] dungeon complex of [[Undermountain]]. A maze of naturally occurring tunnels inhabited by [[magic]]ally altered [[ooze]]s, it was the first of the dungeon's three deepest main levels, collectively called the Gauntlet Below.

==Geography==
A large portion of the caverns were covered in a nonliving ooze that flowed from the [[Swamp of Oblivion]] through an orb placed in one of the caverns by [[Halaster Blackcloak]]. The ooze smelled like rotten eggs and had a yellowish-brown coloration. It sometimes spontaneously formed pseudopods that resembled living creatures.

A shrine dedicated to [[Ghaunadaur]] existed in a cavern on the level. It was surrounded by intelligent oozes, originally [[drow]] and [[duergar]] worshipers who had been transformed by Halaster.

===Entrance===
A tunnel descended into the Caverns from [[Vanrakdoom]] and led to the site of the shipwrecked [[cog]] ''[[Blue Opal]]'', which had sunk in [[Deepwater Harbor]] under mysterious circumstances. The crew was rescued by [[marid]]s, but the ship was never found.

===Exits===
There were several known exits from the Caverns of Ooze:
* A ''[[portal]]'' within the caverns led to [[Seadeeps]].
* A ''portal'' among a pair of [[menhir]]s led to the [[Terminus Level]].
* A blood-sipping ''portal'' led to the [[Maze Level]].
* A tunnel excavated by a [[purple worm]] led to the [[Runestone Caverns]].

==History==
[[File:Illithid_space_hamster-5e.jpg|thumb|300px|''Captain N'ghathrod and a [[miniature giant space hamster]] on the bridge of the ''Scavenger''.'']]
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[spelljammer]] ''[[Scavenger (spelljammer)|Scavenger]]'' was captured by Halaster, [[teleport]]ed into the Caverns of Ooze, and stripped of its [[spelljamming helm]]. The crew of the derelict ship, which included [[H'Catha]]n [[orog]]s, [[gray slaad]]i, and the [[mind flayer]] captain [[N'ghathrod]], were left to fend for themselves in the cave complex.

==Inhabitants==
Around [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the complex was inhabited by the [[marid]] [[Ichthyglug|Ichthyglug the Voluminous]] and the [[dao]] [[Jarûk|Jarûk the Prismatic]]. The two [[genie]]s had been imprisoned by Halaster in the dungeon and competed for freedom by attempting to rid the [[Runestone Caverns]] of the [[lich]] [[Ezzat]], who had set up residence there. According to Halaster's rules, the first to capture the lich's [[phylactery]] would be freed from the dungeon. They were not allowed to inflict bodily harm on each other.
