The Caverns of Ooze were the 7 main level, and 19 overall, of the Waterdhavian dungeon complex of Undermountain. A maze of naturally occurring tunnels inhabited by magically altered oozes, it was the first of the dungeons three deepest main levels, collectively called the Gauntlet Below.
A large portion of the caverns were covered in a nonliving ooze that flowed from the Swamp of Oblivion through an orb placed in one of the caverns by Halaster Blackcloak. The ooze smelled like rotten eggs and had a yellowish-brown coloration. It sometimes spontaneously formed pseudopods that resembled living creatures.
A shrine dedicated to Ghaunadaur existed in a cavern on the level. It was surrounded by intelligent oozes, originally drow and duergar worshipers who had been transformed by Halaster.
A tunnel descended into the Caverns from Vanrakdoom and led to the site of the shipwrecked cog Blue Opal, which had sunk in Deepwater Harbor under mysterious circumstances. The crew was rescued by marids, but the ship was never found.
There were several known exits from the Caverns of Ooze
* A portal within the caverns led to Seadeeps.
* A portal among a pair of menhirs led to the Terminus Level.
* A blood-sipping portal led to the Maze Level.
* A tunnel excavated by a purple worm led to the Runestone Caverns.

In the late 15 century DR, the spelljammer Scavenger was captured by Halaster, teleported into the Caverns of Ooze, and stripped of its spelljamming helm. The crew of the derelict ship, which included HCathan orogs, gray slaadi, and the mind flayer captain Nghathrod, were left to fend for themselves in the cave complex.
Around 1492 DR, the complex was inhabited by the marid Ichthyglug the Voluminous and the dao Jar√ªk the Prismatic. The two genies had been imprisoned by Halaster in the dungeon and competed for freedom by attempting to rid the Runestone Caverns of the lich Ezzat, who had set up residence there. According to Halasters rules, the first to capture the lichs phylactery would be freed from the dungeon. They were not allowed to inflict bodily harm on each other.
