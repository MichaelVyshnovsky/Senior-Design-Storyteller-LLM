==Exploring Gauntlgrym==

[[Gauntlgrym]] is an ancient dwarven city sealed away from the world so completely that for generations, even its location was forgotten. Then dwarves returned from the mountains claiming to have found Gauntlgrym and describing its wonders ... until they were murdered. {{Dusup|183/Exploring Gauntlgrym}}

==[[Eye on the Realms]]: Circle of Fangs, Part 2==
: ''By [[Ed Greenwood]], illustrated by [[William O'Connor]].'' '''p. 56-58'''
Mysterious, magic rings have been found in scattered locales. Sages understand what the rings do, but not why. All of them are mystically linked together and, it seems, bound to some other, unidentifiable entity. {{Dusup|183/Eye on the Realms: Circle of Fangs, Part 2}}
