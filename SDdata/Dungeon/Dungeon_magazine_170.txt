'''''Dungeon'' issue 170''' was released in September of 2009 in online format only. It contained the following article related to the [[Forgotten Realms]]:

==City of Aboleths==
: ''By [[Bruce R. Cordell]], illustrated by [[Michael Franchina]]
{{quote|Aboleths are one of the most terrifying and alien threats in existence. Learn about one of their strongholds, complete with sample encounters and several new aboleth varieties, and prepare to turn
your adventurers into thralls devoted to their new aboleth masters.}}
Encounters in the [[aboleth]] city of [[Xxiphu]] from the novel ''[[City of Torment]]''. {{Dusup|170/City of Aboleths}}

==Monument of the Ancients==
: ''By [[Brian R. James]] &amp; [[Matt James]], illustrated by [[Eric Belisle]], Cartography by [[Sean MacDonald]].'' '''p. 47-82'''
{{quote|If myth and legend are to be believed, the antediluvian monument defends a region of [[Faerûn]] where the boundary between the world of [[Toril]] and the [[Elemental Chaos]] is weakest. At the monument's heart lies the [[Anchor of Chaos]], an arcane bulwark sealing a cosmic fissure between the planes. Were the enchantment powering the Anchor to fail, the [[Moonsea]] North would stand defenseless against a full-scale invasion by forces of elemental evil. Unbeknownst to the citizens of [[Phlan]], that day is nearly upon them.}}
This adventure involves a [[barbarian]] attack on the region of Moonsea North, which sent survivors into the city of Phlan. The attackers were ordered by an ancient evil, a "lost god" from Toril's past with connections to the Elemental Chaos.{{Dusup|170/Monument of the Ancients}}
