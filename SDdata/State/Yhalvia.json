            "Legacy": "By the 14th century [[DR]], Yhalvia was believed to possibly lie on another world entirely,The earlier sources suggested that Yhalvia \"may have been located on another world altogether\", but the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide'' made it a part of ancient Narfell. This article assumes this to be the ancient empire of Narfell, rather than the later land of the same name, but the date of Yhalvia remains unknown. However, Narfell is known for its close links with [[demon]]s, so the appearance of a devil with such power is unusual."
