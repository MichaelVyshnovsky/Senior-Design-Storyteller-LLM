It was historically one of the most prosperous countries of [[Faerûn]].{{fact}}\n\nAs of [[1372 DR]], the country was under threat from all sides and struggling to hold onto order. Nobles bickered over land rights, [[Sembia]]n merchants and a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell tried to gain a trading foothold, and there was a [[Zhentarim]] presence. The [[Thultanthar|city of Shade]] and the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] both posed a threat.{{fact}}\n\nAround 1372 DR, the country felt the effects of the [[Goblin War]] and the death of King [[Azoun IV]]. Bandits inhabited the roads and remnants of [[orc]] and [[goblin]] armies inhabited the forests. The town of [[Tilverton]] was destroyed in a battle against the [[Shadovar]], leaving the strategically important northeast of the country open to raiders wishing to invade.{{fact}}\n\nThe ruler as of 1372 DR, Regent [[Alusair Obarskyr]], had her hands full dealing with all of these threats. She had the experienced [[Purple Dragons]] and [[War Wizards]] at her disposal.{{fact}}\n\nAs of 1486 DR, Queen [[Raedra Obarskyr]] ruled the country and focused on rebuilding after the past few years of war.\n\nAdventuring was frowned upon without an official license, but adventurers could likely lend a tremendous amount of aid to the overstretched Cormyrian military. Lady Alusair was known to offer land in exchange for services rendered to her country, so this was a place adventurers wanting to make a name for themselves tended to flock to.{{fact}}\n\n{{quote|''What a land is Cormyr! Certainly, the geography is dramatic - edged by mountains and sea, filled with forests and swamps - but why dwell on these when the great walls of Suzail loom ahead?''|Excerpt from ''[[The Approachable East]]''}}",
        "History": "{{Main|History of Cormyr}}\nCormyr was founded in the {{YearlinkName|26}}. Its first king was [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]], son of [[Ondeth Obarskyr]] and [[Suzara Obarskyr]]. The kingdom was initially formed because the elves and humans in the region needed to get along with each other. Since that time, Cormyr grew by absorbing the realms of [[Esparin]] and [[Orva]] and claiming the [[Stonelands]] as its own.\n\nSome time between [[376 DR]] and [[432 DR]], Cormyr was invaded by many dragons, including [[Thauglor]], the Purple Dragon, so-called because his scales went purple with age, who laid waste to virtually all of the settlements in the country. It was then raided by [[orc]]s from the [[Stonelands]], who occupied the [[King's Forest]] until they were finally driven out in the {{YearlinkName|429}}, by King [[Duar Obarskyr]]. By the {{YearlinkName|432}}, many noble families had left Cormyr for either the [[Dalelands]] or [[Waterdeep]], or split into small factional bands. The city of [[Suzail]] was sold to [[Magrath the Minotaur]] and his pirates by a traitor to the crown around this time, and it was after Magrath's death that the Purple Dragon was adopted as the nation's official symbol.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, [[Gondegal]], also known as \"The Usurper King\" and \"The Lost King\", attempted to establish a separate kingdom centred on the city of [[Arabel]]. He was overthrown, after only eight days in power, by an allied army composed of forces from [[Tilverton]], [[Sembia]], and [[Daggerdale]], along with the [[Purple Dragons]], led by King [[Azoun IV]].\n\nThe [[Goblin War]] begun by the elf-dragon [[Nalavara]] did significant damage to the kingdom, resulting in the deaths of King [[Azoun IV]] and his heir, [[Tanalasta Obarskyr]] in [[1371 DR]].{{Cite digital book/Death of the Dragon|5244|41}}{{Cite digital book/Death of the Dragon|5495|43}} This began the Steel Regency of [[Alusair Obarskyr]], until Tanalasta's newborn son [[Azoun V]] could take the throne.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|17-18}}{{Cite digital book/Death of the Dragon|5888|46}}\n\nThe [[Spellplague]] did not spare Cormyr, but it survived relatively unharmed, save for the loss of a third of its [[War Wizards]]. Tensions between Cormyr and its neighbors [[Netheril]] and [[Sembia]] were constant, further fueled by the assassinations of Cormyrean royalty.{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|17}}\n\nBetween [[1484 DR]] and [[1486 DR]] Cormyr fought a war on two fronts as it mustered troops to defend the Dalelands against Sembia's invasion and its own borders were invaded by Netheril.{{Cite digital book/The Godborn/Kindle|2422}} By the end of the war Cormyr had successfully reclaimed its land from the Sembian and Netherese forces and turned its focus to recovery.",

            "Laws of the Kingdom": "{{main|Laws of Cormyr}}\nBy [[1368 DR]], the following laws had been posted at all major entry points to Cormyr.\n# \"All persons entering Cormyr must register with the officials of a border garrison.\"\n# \"Foreign currency can only be used in certain locations. Please exchange your coins for Cormyrean [[Golden lion (coin)|golden lions]] at your first opportunity.\"\n# \"Adventurers must acquire a charter before undertaking any operation as a group.\"\n# \"All weapons must be peace-bonded. The only persons exempt from this law are members of chartered adventuring groups and members of mercenary groups that can offer proof of employment.\"\n# \"Harming [[cat]]s is forbidden.\"\n# \"Bow your head to royalty and the local nobility.\"\n# \"[[Purple Dragons]] have the right to search you upon request.\"\n# \"Hunting on private land is forbidden.\"\n\nApart from acting as part of Cormyr's military, the [[Purple Dragons]] and local militias, as well as the [[War Wizards]], acted as the kingdom's law enforcement. The purple dragons in particular were seen as enforcers of the \"royal word\".{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|2}}.  \n\nIn the 15th century DR, [[Azoun Obarskyr V|King Azoun V]] put in place the [[Suzail Writ]], which reformed Cormyrian law. Among other provisions, the Writ limited the powers of the nobility and granted inalienable rights to commoners, such as the right to a trial by jury.{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|47}}"

        "Society": {
            "Nobility": "{{Cormyr titles}}\n''For a list of houses, see: [[:Category:Cormyrean houses|Category:Cormyrian houses]]''\n\nThe nobility of Cormyr were composed of the most wealthy and influential households. There was an annual ceremony at the beginning of the summer where each noble house came to [[Suzail]] to meet and see the monarch and discuss their achievements over the previous year, before retiring to their summer residences.. By the 15th Century DR, there were two dozen major noble houses, and an oscillating number of more obscure ones. Nobles were born, not made, but there were exceptions in the form of local lords.  \n\nLocal lords, appointed to govern localities in the name of the crown, were a subclass in relation to the Cormyrean noble houses, referred to as the \"landed nobility\" in order to distinguish the two. While it was true that people appointed as local lords were commonly members of the noble houses, that wasn't necessarily the case. The crown could appoint a notable commoner, who has either distinguished himself or been recommended by the townspeople, or someone who is the default ruler of a particular place by their personal influence alone. However, because local lords must be nobles, the appointment of a commoner serves to ennoble the individual, who is granted a noble title (if they didn't already have one). [[Myrmeen Lhal]] was an exemple of this, after being named king's lord of Arabel.\n\nThe landed nobility generally had positive relations with local lords, but many noble houses treat the crown's appointed servants as mere lackeys, involved with the petty affairs of commoners.\n\nCormyr's laws were explicitly written to reflect that the noble houses enjoyed their lands and titles at the \"favor of the crown\", meaning a family could lose their lands and titles if they were disloyal to the nation, as was case with [[House Bleth]], and for a time, [[House Cormaeril]].\n\nAmong the major noble families, three were particularly distinguished, sharing the label of \"royal houses\" with the [[Obarskyr|Obarskyrs]] themselves. These were [[House Crownsilver]], [[Huntsilver]], and [[Truesilver]], and are considered to be royal due to their historic blood ties to Cormyr's royal line, as they are descended from the silver brothers, whose offspring married into the Obarskyr dynasty. However, by 1368 DR there was a law that only someone with Obarskyr blood could take the throne.\n\nNobles swore allegiance to the crown on the sword [[Symylazarr]]. Nobles owed the king of Cormyr a certain number of troops, in lieu of their military service, under Cormyrian law.\n\nThe nobility of Cormyr were fond of playing board games and were known to keep gaming tables in the parlors of their homes..",
            "Common folk": "In Cormyte society, everyone who wasn't from a noble family or a local lord was considered a commoner. Commoners were divided between farmers, crafters and merchants. Commoners also filled most of the ranks of the [[Purple Dragons]] and the militias.\n\nFarmers were the foundation of the kingdom's conservative society, and farming was Cormyr's largest occupation. They mostly lived simple lives in land quite a distance from towns. Cormyrian farmers tended to have a strong sense of unity amongst themselves, more so then compared to most places. They also tended to be loyal to the Crown and the monarch, having promptly volunteered to join the military in times of crisis, such and when Gondengal threatened to break the realm apart and during the conflicts against Netheril and Sembia in the 15th century DR{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|47-48}}.\n\nThere has never been serfdom in Cormyr. Its farmers were all citizens, who either independently owned the land they cultivated, or were landless crofters (the norm in upland Cormyr) who farmed land owned by someone else while paying rent, through either coin or a yield share. These landless farmers were in no way bound to the land, and could move if they wished.\n\nCormyr's crafters also had a long reputation and tradition, and were respected for being blessed by the gods with the ability to transform materials into goods, either useful or decorative, ideally both. This group encompassed all kinds of artisans and builders, with different towns and cities being a centre for a particular type of craft. Unlike in other regions, crafter guilds were not particularly powerful, and resembled fraternal organizations. The concept of labor unions was mostly unknown in Cormyr. The exceptions to these rules were certain guilds of constructors that had discovered they could exert quite a bit of political influence by the 14th century DR.\n\nFinally, merchants were the most powerful social class outside the nobility. This group had became quite powerful, and their riches surpass even that of some noble families. Merchant influence was usually seen when a merchant house saved a noble family from financial trouble in exchange for behind-the-scenes control of a government post held by such nobles. Despite their power, the merchant class almost always maintained the interests of the nation and of the royalty above their own. This loyalty was due in part to the favorable mercantile conditions maintained by Cormyr's rulers. Their political influence grew steadily by the 15th century DR ."

Older coins existed that were minted in the [[Elder Forest Kingdom]] but these were not minted in the 14th century DR.\n\nBy around [[1479 DR]], Cormyrian coins bore the visage of [[Foril Obarskyr I|King Foril I]]. They aged well and were made of pure metals with good weight. Coins were designated in regards to the [[Royal Mint]] that produced them by their mint mark. The marks were a three-decker, four-masted carrack for the mint in Suzail and two parallel crescent moons for the one in High Horn. \n\nCoins were referred to by the following names:\n* [[Thumb (coin)|Thumbs]]: [[copper]] pieces\n* [[Falcon (coin)|Falcons]]: [[silver]] pieces\n* [[Golden lion (coin)|Lions]]: [[gold]] pieces\n* [[Tricorn (coin)|Tricrowns]]: [[platinum]] pieces",

Due to commercial logging and clearing for farming, however, the once-great forests became restricted to the [[King's Forest]] in the west, the [[Hullack Forest]] in the east, and the relatively small [[Hermit's Wood]] to the south between Wheloon and the [[Dragonmere]]. The Dragonmere, an expanse of water connected to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], bordered Cormyr to the south. The [[Storm Horns]] mountains formed a boundary to the north and west of Cormyr, with the [[Thunder Peaks]] to the east. The [[Vast Swamp]] separated Cormyr from [[Sembia]] in the southeast.

In the 15th century DR, they were divided into companies.{{Cite dragon/407/Character Themes: Heroes of Cormyr|13-14}}\n\nSpecial among the army were the similarly named [[Purple Dragon Knights]], a group so heroic that the reputation of the entire institution was deserved partly due their exploits. These were leaders and high ranking officers among the Purple Dragon, regarded for their leadership,  and skill. A Purple Dragon Knight could command from ten to over a hundred regular Purple Dragons. Being included in their ranks was a great honor, and promotion into knighthood was only granted to an exceptional few.",

The realm's control of these lands was tenuous at best, if it were ever achieved in the first place. This claimed territory included the Stonelands, [[Goblin Marches]], and [[High Moors]], as well as other distant parts of the east and west reaches.\n\nThe [[Dragon Coast]] fell under Cormyr's control following the [[Spellplague]] when the city-states there pleaded for assistance during the [[Wailing Years]]. In this time, [[Elversult]], [[Ilipur]], [[Pros]], [[Proskur]], and [[Teziir]] joined Cormyr by various means.\n\nDuring the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Cormyr struggled militarily and politically with [[Netheril]] and [[Sembia]].
