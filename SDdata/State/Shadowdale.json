        "mainbody": "'''Shadowdale''' was a farming community in the [[Dalelands]], in [[north Faerûn]]. It was the home of the archmage [[Elminster Aumar]] and was the home of two of the [[Seven Sisters]], [[Storm Silverhand]] and [[Syluné]]. Through its history, Shadowdale battled both [[Zhentarim]] and [[drow]] invasions. Due to the number of ruins in Shadowdale, it was a popular place for adventuring companies to settle.",
        "History": "{{main|History of Shadowdale}}\nOriginally Shadowdale (then known as the \"Land Under Shadow\") was controlled by the [[drow]], who constructed the original [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba|Twisted Tower]] to protect their underground routes in the area. The drow maintained a population of [[human]]s and other races on the surface, used as slaves.\n\nThe first human ruler of Shadowdale was the water wizard [[Ashaba]], who took power in [[906 DR]] and the Twisted Tower bore his name thereafter, along with the [[River Ashaba]].\n\n[[Aumry Obarskyr]] became Lord of Shadowdale in [[1300 DR]]. Aumry ruled peacefully over the dale with his wife [[Syluné Silverhand]]. The peace in the dale encouraged attacks and sabotage from the [[Zhentarim]], and led to Aumry's assassination in [[1339 DR]]. The assassins responsible for Aumry's death were captured and killed by [[Jyordhan]].{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|132}}{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|139}} Aumry was interned in [[Aumry's Tomb]] under [[Watcher's Knoll]].\n\nAfter Jyordhan's death in [[1345 DR]], Syluné was unofficially the ruler of Shadowdale, and she was aided in its defence by the adventuring company [[Mane's Band]], although she was not the lord. This led to the period being dubbed \"the Time of No Lords\", with Syluné opting not to occupy the Twisted Tower and assume official leadership. The period lasted until [[1348 DR]].\n\nWhen [[Florin Falconhand]] was invited to take up the lordship by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] in 1348 DR, he declined the honor and deferred it to his fellow [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Knight of Myth Drannor]], [[Doust Sulwood]] instead. Doust ruled until [[1353 DR]], by which time he had grown tired of court life and preferred instead to return to adventuring. He passed on the lordship to [[Mourngrym Amcathra]].\n\nMourngrym led the dale against [[Lyran Nanther]] in [[1357 DR]] and the [[Bane]]-led [[Zhentil Keep]] army in [[1358 DR]].\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], [[Nightal 15]], under the cover of darkness, an army of [[Zhentarim]], lead by [[Scyllua Darkhope]], invaded Shadowdale with assistance from the [[Church of Shar]] and the drow [[House Dhuurniv]].{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|158}}\n\nMourngrym ruled until [[1375 DR]].\n\nIn the late 1490s DR, Shadowdale was flourishing under Lady [[Mareldraea Hawkguard]]'s leadership, with a population of around 16,000. The dale boasted various skilled artisans and craftsmen, including ferriers, blacksmiths, wagon makers, and tilemakers, contributing to its prosperity.<ref name=EGP-ST />",
        "Inhabitants": "In [[1369 DR]] the forests on Shadowdale were inhabited by a [[Broken Bones clan|clan]] of [[goblin]]s, a group of protective [[centaur]]s, at least one [[voadkyn]] and a [[green dragon]] named [[Emerash]]. Other creatures included [[ankheg]]s, [[bear]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[owlbear]]s and [[hairy spider]]s. Among other creatures, the overland included [[wolf|wolves]], [[drake]]s and even a group of marauding [[half-ogre]]s. It was also home to the group of centaurs known as the [[Sylvan Guardians]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Notable locations": "The seat of power in Shadowdale was the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]]. [[Castle Grimstead]], dating from [[834 DR]], lay not far from the site of the Tower, while [[Castle Krag]], originally a [[drow]] outpost, was situated beneath [[Watcher's Knoll]]., [[Shrine to Tempus (Shadowdale)|Tempus]]\n\n* [[Druid's Grove]]\n* [[Elf Leap]]\n* [[Fox Ridge]]\n* [[Freedale]]\n* [[Hangman's Knoll]]\n* [[Harpers' Hill]]\n* [[Krag Pool]]\n* [[Shadow Ridge]]\n* [[Mistledale Mount]]\n* [[Shadowdale (town)]]\n* [[The Old Skull Tor]]\n* [[Toad Knoll]]\n* [[Watcher's Knoll]]\n* [[Shraevyn's Tomb]]\n* [[Elminster's tower]]"
        },
        "Politics": "The ruler of Shadowdale was chosen by its inhabitants. This would be someone whom they held in high regard, and was usually an outsider to the dale and someone they regarded as a hero to the dale having provided a service. This was in contrast to other Dales where hereditary rule was common. The inhabitants of Shadowdale generally kept their own lands and freedoms, swearing fealty to the lord and helping the community only when outside threats became involved.",
        "Defense": "[[Elminster]] was usually responsible for the defense of Shadowdale, but when he was away on trips, he left this task with [[Storm Silverhand]]."
