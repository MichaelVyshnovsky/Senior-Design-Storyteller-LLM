        "mainbody": "Shadowdale was a farming community in the Dalelands, in north Faerûn. It was the home of the archmage Elminster Aumar and was the home of two of the Seven Sisters, Storm Silverhand and Syluné. Through its history, Shadowdale battled both Zhentarim and drow invasions. Due to the number of ruins in Shadowdale, it was a popular place for adventuring companies to settle.\nOriginally Shadowdale (then known as the \"Land Under Shadow\") was controlled by the drow, who constructed the original Twisted Tower to protect their underground routes in the area. The drow maintained a population of humans and other races on the surface, used as slaves.\nThe first human ruler of Shadowdale was the water wizard Ashaba, who took power in 906 DR and the Twisted Tower bore his name thereafter, along with the River Ashaba.\nAumry Obarskyr became Lord of Shadowdale in 1300 DR. Aumry ruled peacefully over the dale with his wife Syluné Silverhand. The peace in the dale encouraged attacks and sabotage from the Zhentarim, and led to Aumrys assassination in 1339 DR. The assassins responsible for Aumrys death were captured and killed by Jyordhan. Aumry was interned in Aumrys Tomb under Watchers Knoll.\nAfter Jyordhans death in 1345 DR, Syluné was unofficially the ruler of Shadowdale, and she was aided in its defence by the adventuring company Manes Band, although she was not the lord. This led to the period being dubbed \"the Time of No Lords\", with Syluné opting not to occupy the Twisted Tower and assume official leadership. The period lasted until 1348 DR.\nWhen Florin Falconhand was invited to take up the lordship by Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun in 1348 DR, he declined the honor and deferred it to his fellow Knight of Myth Drannor, Doust Sulwood instead. Doust ruled until 1353 DR, by which time he had grown tired of court life and preferred instead to return to adventuring. He passed on the lordship to Mourngrym Amcathra.\nMourngrym led the dale against Lyran Nanther in 1357 DR and the Bane-led Zhentil Keep army in 1358 DR.\nIn 1374 DR, Nightal 15, under the cover of darkness, an army of Zhentarim, lead by Scyllua Darkhope, invaded Shadowdale with assistance from the Church of Shar and the drow House Dhuurniv.\nMourngrym ruled until 1375 DR.\nIn the late 1490s DR, Shadowdale was flourishing under Lady Mareldraea Hawkguards leadership, with a population of around 16,000. The dale boasted various skilled artisans and craftsmen, including ferriers, blacksmiths, wagon makers, and tilemakers, contributing to its prosperity.\nIn 1369 DR the forests on Shadowdale were inhabited by a clan of goblins, a group of protective centaurs, at least one voadkyn and a green dragon named Emerash. Other creatures included ankhegs, bears, kobolds, owlbears and hairy spiders. Among other creatures, the overland included wolves, drakes and even a group of marauding half-ogres. It was also home to the group of centaurs known as the Sylvan Guardians.\nShadowdale spanned an area from Shadow Gap to Voonlar and its main town, which was also called Shadowdale, lay on the River Ashaba. The dale was covered with patches of light woods, and had a high number of ruins, making it popular with adventurers.\nThe seat of power in Shadowdale was the Twisted Tower of Ashaba. Castle Grimstead, dating from 834 DR, lay not far from the site of the Tower, while Castle Krag, originally a drow outpost, was situated beneath Watchers Knoll., Tempus\n* Druids Grove\n* Elf Leap\n* Fox Ridge\n* Freedale\n* Hangmans Knoll\n* Harpers Hill\n* Krag Pool\n* Shadow Ridge\n* Mistledale Mount\n* Shadowdale (town)\n* The Old Skull Tor\n* Toad Knoll\n* Watchers Knoll\n* Shraevyns Tomb\n* Elminsters tower\nThe ruler of Shadowdale was chosen by its inhabitants. This would be someone whom they held in high regard, and was usually an outsider to the dale and someone they regarded as a hero to the dale having provided a service. This was in contrast to other Dales where hereditary rule was common. The inhabitants of Shadowdale generally kept their own lands and freedoms, swearing fealty to the lord and helping the community only when outside threats became involved.\nElminster was usually responsible for the defense of Shadowdale, but when he was away on trips, he left this task with Storm Silverhand."
