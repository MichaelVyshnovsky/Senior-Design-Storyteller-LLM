'''Tymanchebar''' was once a province of [[Skelkor]], [[Laerakond]], ruled by rebel [[dragonborn]] in [[Abeir]]. It was destroyed during the [[Spellplague]].

==Culture==
The dragonborn of Tymanchebar were highly militaristic, divided into clans that were equivalent to the noble houses of other nations, though the clans themselves often resembled an army more than anything else.{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Year of the Ageless One}}

The constant raiding of the [[dracolich]] [[Daelfyrthimachian]] helped to shape the customs and culture of the dragonborn of Tymanchebar in regards to their ancestor worship and their funerary rites.

==History==
Circa [[1279 DR]], in the world of Abeir, a coalition of Skelkoran rebellious clans of dragonborn slaves, started a [[Dragonborn rebellion|rebellion]] and managed to seize a province of the empire of Skelkor, and after the [[Battle of the Crippled Mountain]], freeing themselves from the rule of the Empress [[Dragon]] [[Gauwervyndhal]].

Renaming that province Tymanchebar, they fought bravely against flights of dragons to maintain their freedom. The dragonborn created many ''djeradi'' ("clanholds", in [[Draconic language|Draconic]]), settlements for each one of the clans. The most important of those was the one that eventually will be called [[Djerad Thymar]], that became the capital of Tymanchebar.

In the wake of the Spellplague, however, Skelkor, along with the rest of Laerakond, was transported to [[Toril]]. During the process, a portion of Tymanchebar, in whose lands was located Djerad Thymar, was separated from Skelkor and fell in the [[Faer√ªn]]ian land of [[Unther]]. With their capital city lost, the remaining dragonborn in Skelkor lost their fighting spirit and Gauwervyndhal was able to defeat them and reconquer what was left of the province.

==Legacy==
The dragonborn nation of [[Tymanther]] was created by the surviving inhabitants of Djerad Thymar in tribute to their lost brethren, and to the kingdom they inadvertently destroyed, Unther.
