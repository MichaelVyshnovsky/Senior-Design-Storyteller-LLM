        "mainbody": "huur was a merrow kingdom of Serôs under the Sea of Fallen Stars in the 6th and 7th centuries DR. Alongside Nmalk, it was one of the two Axe Kingdoms that represented the last of merrow civilization in Serôs.\nIn the Year of the Deep Wound, 582 DR, Tarag, a chieftain of the sea ogres, used the powers of the sword Ilbratha and his own battle strategies to conquer the western frontiers of the merfolk realm of Hmurrath. There, Tarag founded the two Axe Kingdoms of Khuur and Nmalk.\nThe Axe Kingdoms and Hmurrath fell to fighting in the Year of the Killing Blow, 653 DR, beginning the Ninth Serôs War.\nThe merrow suffered a major defeat in the Battle of the Haunted Plains in the Year of the Coveted Briars, 654 DR. Following their defeat, four-fifths of all merrow in Serôs were forced to flee south to the other side of the Sharksbane Wall. The rest survived on the Hmur Plateau or living amidst the ruins on the Haunted Plains.\nThree years of conflict culminated in the destruction of the Axe Kingdoms and the fall of the merrow to the merfolk of Hmurrath in the Year of the Volanth, 655 DR. This saw the end of merrow \"civilization\" in Serôs. \nThe Axe Kingdoms lay along the Dragon Coast and along the coast of Sembia, in the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nCategoryCountries\nCategoryOgre locations\nCategoryLocations in the Axe Kingdoms\nCategoryLocations on the Hmur Plateau\nCategoryLocations in Serôs\nCategoryLocations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations in the Sea of Fallen Stars\nhcyfj0pfqpwsx5qod5gqpaw6duzqqpg"
