        "History": "After the [[Rotting War]] in [[902 DR]], the [[Chondathian Empire]] became weak and lost its hold on several territories. The cities that would become known as the free cities, gained their independence during this time.",
        "Politics": "Despite no official allegiances, the free cities often supported each other and worked together to prevent [[Arrabar]] from regaining the strength it once held.\n\nThe free cities did have disputes and small conflicts from time to time but military might was rarely employed.",
        "Culture": {
            "Festivals": "The Rotting Dance was a festival celebrated in all the free cities. It commemorated the freedom that the cities gained in the Rotting War. The type of celebration varied from city to city; some had parties and parades while others had more respectful ceremonies considering the vast number of people that lost their lives in the conflict."
