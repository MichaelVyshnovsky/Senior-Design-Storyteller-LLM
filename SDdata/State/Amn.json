        "mainbody": "Amn (), also known as the Merchants Domain, was a tremendously wealthy nation in West Faerûn. Prior to the Spellplague and the continents disappearance, Amn held colonies far away in Maztica. Post-Spellplague it still controlled important trade routes to Calimshan and Baldurs Gate as well as colonial ports in the Moonshaes and Chult. Its population, mostly human with a large minority population of halflings, was historically in the range of 3 million. The countrys natural resources and wealth, combined with its mercantile nature led Amn to become one of the most important and influential trading centers throughout Faerûn. The crowning jewel of this powerful state was the capital city of Athkatla, founded in 100 DR (0 in the rarely-used Amnian calendar) and often known as the \"City of Coin.\"\nGeographically, Amn was a fairly small state, though its size was impressive compared with its neighbor and frequent rival, Baldurs Gate. Historically, Amn held several colonies in Maztica but during the Spellplague these disappeared from Toril along with the rest of the continent. However, Amn remained a colonial power through the 15th century DR, primarily through its fortified ports in both Chult and the Moonshae Isles, as well as the Mhair Archipelago.\nThe weather was pleasant almost all the year round in Amn. At Lake Esmel, the temperature was warmer due to the hot springs. A diverse selection of crops grew very well in Amn, making for a surplus which was traded with other nations. Amns rainy season was from Uktar to early Tarsakh. The winters were mild with minor freezes and a little snow all across the nation with the exception of Esmeltaran on Lake Esmel. Although the rivers froze over during Hammer, they did not harden enough to make crossing the ice safe. Due to blizzards in the Cloud Peaks over the winter, Nashkel could often become isolated from Athkatla.\n* Lake Esmel A lake located along the eastern border of Amn. Unusually deep, Lake Esmel was home to several hot mineral springs and, according to local legend, a powerful dragon.\n* Forest of Shadows Also known as Shilmista, this ancient woodland overlapped with the elven kingdom of Elbereth.\n* Snakewood\n* Cloud Peaks A mountain range at the northern edge of Amn, infested with dangerous monsters but home also to precious gems.\n* Mount Speartop The highest point in Amn, three miles above sea level.\n* Small Teeth A mountain range containing many evil humanoids.\n* Snowflake Mountains A range of mountains in West Faerûn.\n* Troll Mountains A range of low mountains, so named for the rather intelligent trolls that inhabited their peaks. An enormous 4,000-foot slab resembling a dwarf could be found in the mountains, marking the location of a long-abandoned dwarven city. They were also notable for their large deposits of gems.\nSince its unification under Thayze Selemchant Amn was ruled by the Council of Six, who resided in Athkatla. Their main duties were to maintain trade within and outside of Amn, controlling nearly every aspect regarding the economy of the nation. Separate from their economic concerns, the council also coordinated the militaristic defense of the nation, a task in which each individual member had a particular role. These positions were anonymously held.\nAfter the Spellplague, however, things changed. The number of seats on the Council was reduced from six to five. Amn remained an oligarchy but abandoned all pretenses of being anything else and the positions on the Council were openly held by the rulers of five houses Alibakkar, Dannihyr, Nashivaar, Ophal, and Selemchant.\nHowever, despite all appearances to the contrary, many other forces continued to hold a great deal of power in the country, despite the efforts of the Council to contain them.\nNext down in the power scheme of Amn were its mercantile houses, companies formed by the consolidation of two or more lesser merchants or merchant families wealth. Both the Council and the Shadow Thieves supported these consortia, investing small shares in order to keep an eye on the economic interests of the guilds and lesser families. The success of a house might make or break the influence and power of its investors.\nStanding beside the merchant houses in power were the Cowled Wizards, the Emerald Cabal, and the Shadow Thieves, each of whom possessed an enormous degree of unofficial power behind the scenes. The Cowled Wizards were themselves the only legal arcane institution in Amn, all others banned by decree of the Council, and were controlled by the powerful Selemchants, who they served most often as underhanded agents or mercenaries. Opposing the Cowled Wizards were the secretive Emerald Cabal, a league of illegal arcane spellcasters opposed to the entire Amnian system and who were unafraid to use violent means to achieve their ends. Like the Emerald Cabal, the Shadow Thieves power was substantially illegal but in spite of this they held a considerable amount of power comparable to that of the merchant houses of Cowled Wizards, heading a criminal network that flowed between their lair in Crimmor, the rest of Amn, and the nations of the Sword Coast to the north.\nIn the Lands of Intrigue, including Amn and Tethyr, village lords, also known as mayors, and harbormasters, were elective offices in smaller settlements and port townships. Bigger cities had these positions assigned by nobles and wealthy influential locals as reward postings for investors and other distinguished individuals. As for elections, voting rights were granted to stakeholders, businesspeople, property owners, and warehouse or shipyard landlords.\nVotes commenced vocally and in person in front of the local herald, witnessed by local clergy. Each local denomination had its representatives as witnesses. Candidates for the offices could be any local resident. The vote count was performed through pebbles tossed in jars each stone represented a vote and was tossed in as the voter voiced their choice. These voting jars were labeled and safeguarded by the herald and witness priests. Election time could last as long as a tenday but more commonly lasted for two or three days. Majority ruled. If tampering was detected during counting, the new election took place. When the office was vacant in case of multiple re-elections, local clergy stepped in to perform the offices job until the winner was announced.\nSome of the southern settlements in Amn had split loyalties, with some preferring to join Tethyr to the south, because of its recent prosperity as of 1370 DR. At the time, the border between Amn and Tethyr was formed by the Tethir Road, although some disputed this, claiming it to be the Tejarn Hills. To the east, Amns extent was marked by Shilmista, and to the west, by the Sea of Swords.\nIn the north, Amn extended to the northern edge of the Cloud Peaks and Nashkel. However, more recently Amns attentions have turned to Waterdeep, Amns chief rival for international trade.\nGenerally speaking, Amn had few friends, and even Tethyr, ostensibly Amns ally, viewed its neighbors activities with deep concern.\nAmnian battle banners usually flown in battles were cut in the shape of a golden keystone. Pennants hung atop fortresses had a long and thin shape of stretched triangles. Banners and pennants had bright red bodies and golden borders with the image of the “The Pride of Amn” – the badge that decorated the banners of city gates and worn by the civic building guards. “The Pride of Amn” remained unchanged through the century that followed the Spellplague – horizontal row of six equally-sized gold circles atop a steel-gray open fanged maw. The circles that symbolized the “coins of all” as well as the Council of Six. The coins were featureless, indicating the trade nature of Amn accepting coinage from across the Realms and stressing the anonymity of the Council. The maw was called “daerag” and symbolized Amn devouring its trade adversaries.\nMoney flowed in and out of Amn like no other country. It received a lot of goods from Calimshan and Tethyr to the south, on their way to the Heartlands in the north. It was rivals with Waterdeep and Sembia.\nIn the past, stone was imported from Mirabar via Luskan for use in construction, having been magically transported which was an expensive process. Since Luskans demise, however, this particular route was cut off. While trade was definitely profitable in Amn the nations lifeline of commerce was constantly under threat from the savage land of Muranndin directly to the south.\nAround a sixth of the population of Amn lived within its cities and major towns, with the rest living in villages and rural farmlands. Two thirds of the population lived west of Lake Esmel. Around the Year of Wild Magic roughly 84% of inhabitants were human and 15% halfling. The latter number, however, grew substantially in the 15th century DR due in large part to the destruction of Luiren, the ancestral home of the halfling race. The native humans of Amn were primarily descended from Calishites and Tethyrians. A very small proportion of Amns inhabitants were shield dwarves (in the mountainous areas) and wild elves (in Shilmista or Snakewood), and fewer still from these races decided to inhabit the cities. Gnomes were a rare sight in the cities and aroused interest. Except for Purskul, whose labor force was more than 20% half-orc, this race and half-elves were rare. Half-orcs were looked down upon as second-class citizens.\nIn Amnian society, humans treated halflings as equals thanks to their business skills. Although human businesses tended to have a strict hierarchy and leadership, halflings tended to rely more on teamwork, with no one individual having sole responsibility. Few halflings lived west of Esmeltaran, preferring to live in segregation in this city or in Riatavin, because these settlements were near the lost halfling realm of Meiritin\nMoney was the key to status in Amn. A successful person was measured by the amount of wealth they display in material possessions, to the extent that it was possible to buy nobility, at the right price. Lavish parties were common in recognition of events such as a business success, and these were often expensive, but acted to further demonstrate the wealthy status of the host. Status could also be demonstrated by giving expensive gifts or gratuities.\nStatus could be measured in terms of the location of a persons property, although not so much importance was placed on the amount of land owned. Athkatla was the most coveted of places for a residence, and the Gem District was the best area in the city. As a merchant family rose in status, it was expected to acquire more than one property, and estates around Lake Esmel were the finest of these.\nAnother form of demonstrating status was ones attire. Women often wore turbans, with more elaborate and ornate examples showing off higher status, such as gold, silver or platinum threaded embroidery. Metal-embroidered silk garments were popular amongst all classes and both genders. Vests or cloaks of fur from the North were in fashion, despite the temperate climate. Jewellery could be another show of status. Gem-inlaid precious metal rings were common, and pearls (especially black pearls) were in high demand. Dressing in ornate or fancy garments and jewellery was frowned upon amongst the wealthiest Amnian families, who wore simpler clothing, resorting to the other displays of status instead.\nStatus was measured using a scale of precious metals, from \"ore\" at the bottom, to \"mithral\" at the top. Lower ranks were often used as insults, while a higher rank could be used to compliment something or someone. These ranks were as follows\n* Ore—the lowest rank. Used to mean filthy or criminal, and strongly insulting.\n* Bronze—the working class. Could also be used to mean a low-rank imposter.\n* Copper—acceptable working class.\n* Steel—best of the working class, or military.\n* Silver—a rising merchant or one with much potential.\n* Gold—one whose wealth was inherited, or one who was wealthy without business sense.\n* Platinum—the head of a mercantile house.\n* Adamantine—the highest self-made rank.\n* Mithral—perfection. The highest possible rank.\nIn general, the richest inhabitants commanded the less wealthy. A recent show of wealth such as a large purchase or high bid could immediately raise a persons status, even above those who were wealthier overall. More emphasis was put on proper business conduct than racial stereotypes, so as long as a potential customer adhered to these rules, it did not matter who they were or where they were from. Even so, Amnians were wary of potential threats to business, so the more wealthy were often accompanied by at least two guards.\nAlthough most languages were spoken in Amn due to the large number of traders from all across the Realms, Thorass was used for official documents and speeches. This was despite Common being used exclusively for this purpose in other neighbouring lands. A regional language sometimes referred to as Amnian common was spoken by the rural inhabitants of Amn, and this was made up of a dialect of Common with certain words in Thorass. There were a number of phrases in common usage in Amn which are unique to the nation. See Amnian phrases.\nIn Amn, arcane magic was considered illegal. Only those wizards who had the patronage of one of the Council of Five, could practice their art. However, divine magic was not considered a problem in Amn as long as the caster was connected to a recognized religious sect.\nThere was no state religion in Amn. Any religious practice was tolerated provided it did not interfere with the Council of Six (the government). All religions were represented in Amn, and religious freedom was important to its inhabitants. Some deities were more favored than others due to their portfolios in relation to the day-to-day affairs of the people.\n* Waukeen  The premier deity in Amn. Temple services to Waukeen were mostly parties and banquets.\n* Lliira  Because Lliira oversaw Waukeens portfolios during the Time of Troubles, her worship grew in Amn.\n* Sune  Well-suited to Amn due to the importance of status and appearance. The clergy of Sune were often dressed more provocatively here than elsewhere in the Realms.\n* Chauntea  Due to the importance of agriculture in Amn, Chauntea was worshiped widely near the time of harvests. Most worship occurred in small shrines in rural areas.\n* Selûne  Mainly worshiped in Murann because it was a port city.\n* Cyric  Many temples of Bane fell to Cyric after Tellvon Bloodshoulders efforts. The worship of Cyric was spread through the Shadow Thieves.\n* Helm  Prior to the gods death in the , Helm was worshiped in Amn, though not extensively except in Trademeet.\n* Ilmater  Like the fallen Helm, Ilmater was not worshiped extensively except in Trademeet.\nAmn, one of Faerûns youngest nations but also one of its richest, had a brief but crowded history. By the time of the Spellplague, Amn had expanded further than any other Faerûnian power yet, reaching its influence to the shores of the fabled continent of Maztica across the Trackless Sea. There, it remained a local power until, during the cataclysmic events of the Year of Blue Fire the entire continent disappeared, along with all of its inhabitants. Even so, Amns status as a colonial power was hardly broken and in the absence of its old colonies, the ambitious rulers of the Merchants Domain instead opened up colonies in the more local arenas of Chult, the Mhair Archipelago, and the Moonshae Isles.\n* Amnwater A major caravan stop between Crimmor and Keczulla.\n* Athkatla (pop. 122,000) The \"City of Coin\" was the capital and crowning jewel of Amns realm. It was considered a pilgrimage site for followers of Waukeen, and was overlooked by the massive temple of Goldspires.\n* Crimmor (pop. 40,000) A walled trading hub east of Athkatla, just south of the Cloud Peaks along the southern Trade Way. Crimmor was also the open center of Shadow Thief activity.\n* Eshpurta (pop. 24,252, as of 1372 DR) Amns main military city, located in the eastern part of the kingdom, south of the Troll Mountains.\n* Esmeltaran (pop. 35,000) A major city on Lake Esmel, famed for its resorts and luxuries.\n* Imnescar A large town on the Trade Way in the Small Teeth, site of Amns victory in the Ogre Wars.\n* Keczulla (pop. 47,733) A gem-mining town that previously contained many gold and iron mines.\n* Murann A major city and Amns main seaport.\n* Purskul (pop. 27,210) A granary city that was also an important caravan stop.\n* Riatavin The \"Gateway to the East\" seceded from Amn in 1370 DR, joining Tethyr and almost causing a war between the realms.\n* Trademeet A large town of Amn, famed for its fair deals.\n* Bormton A village near Tethyr destroyed by a mob.\n* Coryllvol A village on the Shimmalshyr that sold bottled water.\n* Esford A minor town on the Esmel River that served as a trade post.\n* Gambiton A village at the crossroads of the Imnescourse Trail and South Road, south of Esmeltaran.\n* Minsor Vale\n* Nashkel A remote town that sat on Amns northern frontier past the Cloud Peaks with the Sword Coast.\n* Orlsfall A ghost town north of the Ridge.\n* Shepherdston A rural farming village near the Small Teeth.\n* St. Carwells Vale A tiny remote village in the Hamlar Hills.\n* Trailstone A village on the edge of Amn that seceded to Tethyr alongside Riatavin.\n* Citadel Amnur A large modern fortress north of Lake Weng in the Cloud Peaks.\n* Citadel Rashturl A sibling of Amnur, east of Rashturl in the mountains.\n* Hillfort Ishla The westernmost of the primitive Hillforts, in the eastern Small Teeth mountains.\n* Hillfort Keshla The easternmost Hillfort at the eastern frontier of Amn.\n* Hillfort Torbold The central Hillfort, in the middle of the Tejarn Hills.\n* New Amn The Maztican colony and its capital of Helmsport were founded in 1361 DR by the conquering Golden Legion, who variously enslaved, slew, and integrated the natives.\n* Port Nyanzaru (pop. 12,000) A highly profitable Amnian port in Chult, Port Nyanzaru was well-defended, protected by three gates and a high wall.\n* Snowdown (pop. 20,000) One of the Moonshae Isles, Snowdown was controlled by Amn through the Lady Erliza Daressin.\n* Spellhold This settlement was once an asylum located on the island of Brynnlaw, off the western coast of Amn, under the command of the Cowled Wizards of Athkatla, used to house the deviants they have found in Amn, practicing magic without an official license. However, it was abandoned during the Hundred Years of Chaos and was considered a taboo location for travelers."
