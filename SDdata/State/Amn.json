Prior to the [[Spellplague]] and the continent's disappearance, Amn held colonies far away in [[Maztica]]. Post-Spellplague it still controlled important trade routes to [[Calimshan]] and [[Baldur's Gate]] as well as colonial ports in the [[Moonshae Isles|Moonshaes]] and [[Chult]]. Its population, mostly [[human]] with a large minority population of [[halfling]]s, was historically in the range of 3 million. The country's natural resources and wealth, combined with its mercantile nature led Amn to become one of the most important and influential trading centers throughout [[Faerûn]]. The crowning jewel of this powerful state was the capital city of [[Athkatla]], founded in [[100 DR]] (0 in the rarely-used [[Amnian calendar]]) and often known as the \"City of Coin.\"\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Geography": {
            "Climate": "The weather was pleasant almost all the year round in Amn. At [[Lake Esmel]], the temperature was warmer due to the hot springs. A diverse selection of crops grew very well in Amn, making for a surplus which was traded with other nations. Amn's rainy season was from [[Uktar]] to early [[Tarsakh]]. The winters were mild with minor freezes and a little snow all across the nation with the exception of [[Esmeltaran]] on Lake Esmel. Although the rivers froze over during [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], they did not harden enough to make crossing the ice safe. Due to blizzards in the Cloud Peaks over the winter, Nashkel could often become isolated from Athkatla.",

        "Government": {
            "Village Lords and Harbormasters": "In the [[Lands of Intrigue]], including Amn and Tethyr, village lords, also known as mayors, and harbormasters, were elective offices in smaller settlements and port townships. Bigger cities had these positions assigned by nobles and wealthy influential locals as reward postings for investors and other distinguished individuals. As for elections, voting rights were granted to stakeholders, businesspeople, property owners, and warehouse or shipyard landlords.\n\nVotes commenced vocally and in person in front of the local herald, witnessed by local clergy. Each local denomination had its representatives as witnesses. Candidates for the offices could be any local resident. The vote count was performed through pebbles tossed in jars; each stone represented a vote and was tossed in as the voter voiced their choice. These voting jars were labeled and safeguarded by the herald and witness priests. Election time could last as long as a tenday but more commonly lasted for two or three days. Majority ruled. If tampering was detected during counting, the new election took place. When the office was vacant in case of multiple re-elections, local clergy stepped in to perform the office's job until the winner was announced.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-09 - Village Lords in Amn and Tethyr}}",
            "Foreign Relations": "Some of the southern settlements in Amn had split loyalties, with some preferring to join [[Tethyr]] to the south, because of its recent prosperity as of 1370 DR. At the time, the border between Amn and Tethyr was formed by the [[Tethir Road]], although some disputed this, claiming it to be the [[Tejarn Hills]]. To the east, Amn's extent was marked by Shilmista, and to the west, by the [[Sea of Swords]].\n\nIn the north, Amn extended to the northern edge of the [[Cloud Peaks]] and [[Nashkel]]. However, more recently Amn's attentions have turned to [[Waterdeep]], Amn's chief rival for international trade.\n\nGenerally speaking, Amn had few friends, and even [[Tethyr]], ostensibly Amn's ally, viewed its neighbor's activities with deep concern.",
            "Heraldry": "Amnian battle banners usually flown in battles were cut in the shape of a golden keystone. Pennants hung atop fortresses had a long and thin shape of stretched triangles. Banners and pennants had bright red bodies and golden borders with the image of the “The Pride of Amn” – the badge that decorated the banners of city gates and worn by the civic building guards. “The Pride of Amn” remained unchanged through the century that followed the [[Spellplague]] – horizontal row of six equally-sized gold circles atop a steel-gray open fanged maw. The circles that symbolized the “coins of all” as well as the Council of Six. The coins were featureless, indicating the trade nature of Amn accepting coinage from across the Realms and stressing the anonymity of the Council. The maw was called “[[daerag]]” and symbolized Amn devouring its trade adversaries.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-12-18 - Amnian Flags}}"
        },
        "Trade": "Money flowed in and out of Amn like no other country. It received a lot of goods from [[Calimshan]] and [[Tethyr]] to the south, on their way to the [[Heartlands]] in the north. It was rivals with [[Waterdeep]] and [[Sembia]].\n\nIn the past, stone was imported from [[Mirabar]] via [[Luskan]] for use in construction, having been magically transported which was an expensive process. Since Luskan's demise, however, this particular route was cut off. While trade was definitely profitable in Amn the nation's lifeline of commerce was constantly under threat from the savage land of [[Muranndin]] directly to the south.",
        "Demographics": {
            "Halflings": "In Amnian society, humans treated halflings as equals thanks to their business skills. Although human businesses tended to have a strict hierarchy and leadership, halflings tended to rely more on teamwork, with no one individual having sole responsibility. Few halflings lived west of [[Esmeltaran]], preferring to live in segregation in this city or in [[Riatavin]], because these settlements were near the lost halfling realm of [[Meiritin]]"
        },
        "Society": {
            "Culture": "Money was the key to status in Amn. A successful person was measured by the amount of wealth they display in material possessions, to the extent that it was possible to buy nobility, at the right price. Lavish parties were common in recognition of events such as a business success, and these were often expensive, but acted to further demonstrate the wealthy status of the host. Status could also be demonstrated by giving expensive gifts or gratuities.\n\nStatus could be measured in terms of the location of a person's property, although not so much importance was placed on the amount of land owned. Athkatla was the most coveted of places for a residence, and the [[Gem District (Athkatla)|Gem District]] was the best area in the city. As a merchant family rose in status, it was expected to acquire more than one property, and estates around Lake Esmel were the finest of these.\n\nAnother form of demonstrating status was one's attire. Women often wore turbans, with more elaborate and ornate examples showing off higher status, such as gold, silver or platinum threaded embroidery. Metal-embroidered silk garments were popular amongst all classes and both genders. Vests or cloaks of fur from [[the North]] were in fashion, despite the temperate climate. Jewellery could be another show of status. Gem-inlaid precious metal rings were common, and pearls (especially black pearls) were in high demand. Dressing in ornate or fancy garments and jewellery was frowned upon amongst the wealthiest Amnian families, who wore simpler clothing, resorting to the other displays of status instead.\n\nStatus was measured using a scale of precious metals, from \"ore\" at the bottom, to \"[[mithral]]\" at the top. Lower ranks were often used as insults, while a higher rank could be used to compliment something or someone. These ranks were as follows:\n* '''Ore'''—the lowest rank. Used to mean filthy or criminal, and strongly insulting.\n* '''Bronze'''—the working class. Could also be used to mean a low-rank imposter.\n* '''Copper'''—acceptable working class.\n* '''Steel'''—best of the working class, or military.\n* '''Silver'''—a rising merchant or one with much potential.\n* '''Gold'''—one whose wealth was inherited, or one who was wealthy without business sense.\n* '''Platinum'''—the head of a mercantile house.\n* '''Adamantine'''—the highest self-made rank.\n* '''Mithral'''—perfection. The highest possible rank.\n\nIn general, the richest inhabitants commanded the less wealthy. A recent show of wealth such as a large purchase or high bid could immediately raise a person's status, even above those who were wealthier overall. More emphasis was put on proper business conduct than racial stereotypes, so as long as a potential customer adhered to these rules, it did not matter who they were or where they were from. Even so, Amnians were wary of potential threats to business, so the more wealthy were often accompanied by at least two guards.",
            "Languages": "Although most languages were spoken in Amn due to the large number of traders from all across the Realms, [[Thorass language|Thorass]] was used for official documents and speeches. This was despite [[Common]] being used exclusively for this purpose in other neighbouring lands. A regional language sometimes referred to as [[Amnian common]] was spoken by the rural inhabitants of Amn, and this was made up of a dialect of Common with certain words in Thorass. There were a number of phrases in common usage in Amn which are unique to the nation. See [[Amnian phrases]].",
            "Magic": "In Amn, arcane magic was considered illegal. Only those wizards who had the patronage of one of the Council of Five, could practice their art. However, divine magic was not considered a problem in Amn as long as the caster was connected to a recognized religious sect.",
            "Religion": "There was no state religion in Amn. Any religious practice was tolerated provided it did not interfere with the Council of Six (the government). All religions were represented in Amn, and religious freedom was important to its inhabitants. Some deities were more favored than others due to their portfolios in relation to the day-to-day affairs of the people.\n\n* [[Waukeen]] : The premier deity in Amn. Temple services to Waukeen were mostly parties and banquets.\n* [[Lliira]] : Because Lliira oversaw Waukeen's portfolios during the [[Time of Troubles]], her worship grew in Amn.\n* [[Sune]] : Well-suited to Amn due to the importance of status and appearance. The clergy of Sune were often dressed more provocatively here than elsewhere in the Realms.\n* [[Chauntea]] : Due to the importance of agriculture in Amn, Chauntea was worshiped widely near the time of harvests. Most worship occurred in small shrines in rural areas.\n* [[Selûne]] : Mainly worshiped in [[Murann]] because it was a port city.\n* [[Cyric]] : Many temples of [[Bane]] fell to Cyric after [[Tellvon Bloodshoulder]]'s efforts. The worship of Cyric was spread through the [[Shadow Thieves]].\n* [[Helm]] : Prior to the god's death in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, Helm was worshiped in Amn, though not extensively except in [[Trademeet]].\n* [[Ilmater]] : Like the fallen Helm, Ilmater was not worshiped extensively except in Trademeet."

        "History": "{{Main|History of Amn}}\nAmn, one of Faerûn's youngest nations but also one of its richest, had a brief but crowded history. By the time of the [[Spellplague]], Amn had expanded further than any other Faerûnian power yet, reaching its influence to the shores of the fabled continent of Maztica across the [[Trackless Sea]]. There, it remained a local power until, during the cataclysmic events of the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire]] the entire continent disappeared, along with all of its inhabitants. Even so, Amn's status as a colonial power was hardly broken and in the absence of its old colonies, the ambitious rulers of the Merchant's Domain instead opened up colonies in the more local arenas of Chult, the Mhair Archipelago, and the Moonshae Isles.\n\n{{sectstub}}",
