The Calim Caliphates, more commonly referred to as the Calim Empire, was the great kingdom founded by the noble djinni Calim and his people, the Djen.
At its peak, the empire stretched from the southern Sword Coast to the River Agis and along the Marching Mountains to the Alimir Mountains and south to the Shining Sea.
For all but the last few decades of its existence, the empire was under the sole control of Calim, who ruled as caleph.
Most of the history of the Caliphates were tied with that of Calim.
