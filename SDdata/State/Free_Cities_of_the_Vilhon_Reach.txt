The Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach were a collection of independent city-states that separated themselves from Chondath.
Hlondeth, Lachom, Nimpeth, Reth, and Surkh were considered the five key free cities but the villages of Elupar and Nun were often grouped with them as well.
After the Rotting War in 902 DR, the Chondathian Empire became weak and lost its hold on several territories. The cities that would become known as the free cities, gained their independence during this time.
Despite no official allegiances, the free cities often supported each other and worked together to prevent Arrabar from regaining the strength it once held.
The free cities did have disputes and small conflicts from time to time but military might was rarely employed.
The free cities all shared a strong military culture and dependence on slavery. Nimpeth made use of slaves more than the other free cities.
Military service was also a shared expectation within the city-states. When a boy reached adulthood, he was expected to serve in his local militia. Slaves rarely served in armies unless they were absolutely needed.
The Rotting Dance was a festival celebrated in all the free cities. It commemorated the freedom that the cities gained in the Rotting War. The type of celebration varied from city to city some had parties and parades while others had more respectful ceremonies considering the vast number of people that lost their lives in the conflict.
