The '''Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach''' were a collection of independent city-states that separated themselves from [[Chondath]].

[[Hlondeth]], [[Lachom]], [[Nimpeth]], [[Reth]], and [[Surkh]] were considered the five key free cities but the villages of [[Elupar]] and [[Nun]] were often grouped with them as well.

==History==
After the [[Rotting War]] in [[902 DR]], the [[Chondathian Empire]] became weak and lost its hold on several territories. The cities that would become known as the free cities, gained their independence during this time.

==Politics==
Despite no official allegiances, the free cities often supported each other and worked together to prevent [[Arrabar]] from regaining the strength it once held.

The free cities did have disputes and small conflicts from time to time but military might was rarely employed.

==Culture==
The free cities all shared a strong military culture and dependence on slavery. Nimpeth made use of [[slave]]s more than the other free cities.

Military service was also a shared expectation within the city-states. When a boy reached adulthood, he was expected to serve in his local militia. Slaves rarely served in armies unless they were absolutely needed.

===Festivals===
The Rotting Dance was a festival celebrated in all the free cities. It commemorated the freedom that the cities gained in the Rotting War. The type of celebration varied from city to city; some had parties and parades while others had more respectful ceremonies considering the vast number of people that lost their lives in the conflict.
