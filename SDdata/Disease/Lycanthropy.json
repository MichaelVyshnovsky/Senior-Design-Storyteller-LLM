        "Culture": "Some organizations made it their mission to study the condition of lycanthropy, such as the [[Cabal of the Moon's Blood]]<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Red Dawn|2}} and the [[Silver Stake]]. The latter group would sometimes capture and attempt to cure those afflicted with lycanthropy. And their leader, the [[Mielikkian]] priest [[Karel Mahorne]], worked alongside her fellow Mielikkian clerics to gather lore on curing the condition.<ref>{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Two}}\n\nNo [[deity]] in the Realms had the condition as a part of their [[portfolio|divine portfolio]]. However, priesthoods had conflicting claims on this topic, as some gods were often associated with lycanthropy. For instance, some priests of [[Nobanion]] claimed that he had dominion over the condition, but not lycanthropes themselves.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-02-10 - Portfolios in the Realms - Lycanthropy}}\n\nIn most cities and large towns across [[Faerûn]], it was customary to cremate the remains of those that had been afflicted with lycanthropy.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/07-14 - Disposal of the Dead}} In the nation of [[Dambrath]], many of the nomadic humans who called the land home were [[Malarite]]s or [[Selûnite]]s who viewed lycanthropy as a blessing and sought to contract it.",
        "Acquisition": "As a disease, lycanthropy was generally contracted through open wounds being exposed to the blood, saliva, or other secretions of a true lycanthrope or another infected. Some legends also claimed the disease could potentially be contracted through love making.\n\n[[Animal]]s could also act as carriers of the contagion,{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|2}} such as [[spider]]s,{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-08-21/How many kinds of lycanthropes are there?}}{{Cite dragon/410/Howl at the Moon|7}} thus a spider carrying lycanthropy would inflict the [[werespider]] phenotype. And [[Malar]]'s [[avatar]], the Beast, inflicted a random form of [[evil]] lycanthropy upon those bitten by it.<ref>\n\nThe offspring of a lycanthrope and non-infected had the potential to inherit the condition.<ref> If the condition was not inherited, the offspring and its descendants would instead gain a resistance to lycanthropy. If ever exposed to the contagion they would become what was known as a [[quasilycanthrope]].<ref>{{Cite web/Earthmother's Weapons}}\n\n[[Human]]s and [[demihuman]]s were susceptible to all forms of lycanthropy. Other humanoid races were less uniform in their susceptibility, being less likely or outright immune to contracting certain phenotypes through pathologic means. Some of the humanoid races that were known to be susceptible to lycanthropy included [[bugbear]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[kender]], [[kobold]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s, [[sahuagin]], [[troll]]s, all [[true giant]]s, [[firbolg]]s, [[voadkyn]], and [[cyclopskin]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/266/Dragon's Bestiary: Giant Lycanthropes}} Creatures that were highly innately [[magic]]al were generally immune.\n\nAs a curse, there were a number of ways in which lycanthropy could be acquired or afflicted. This included the [[Dark Powers]], ''[[wish]]'', ''[[curse of lycanthropy]]'',<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Friends in Low Places|21}} some cursed [[scroll]]s in the land of [[Zakhara]],<ref> and could by chance occur from drinking a ''[[great elixir]]''.<ref>",
        "Effects": {
            "Transfiguration": "Those who were afflicted with lycanthropy often didn't have full control over their ability to transform and could be triggered into doing so by a certain circumstance(s). The most common of these in the Realms and elsewhere was a moon, such as [[Toril]]'s [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]], entering its full-moon phase.\n\nNotably, exposure to the Selûnite substance ''[[moonfire]]'' could give a lycanthrope complete control over their transformations for a span of seven moons.<ref> And ''[[incense of lycanthropy]]'' could potentially suppress the forced transformation brought on by a full moon. Conversely, there were some things that could forcefully trigger a transformation, such as ''[[moonbeam]]'' or being in the presence of a [[moon dragon]] in its white-phase.<ref>\n\nIf a [[silverstar]] (a variety of Selunite [[specialty priest]]) was infected by a lycanthrope who was [[chaotic good|morally upstanding, without any care for ethical standing]], or the moral and ethical outlook of that creature was in line with that of the silverstar, then the priest's condition would act in a manner comparable to natural lycanthropy.\n\nThe process of transfiguring between lycanthropic states was a painful experience for all but true lycanthropes. If killed while in its animal or hybrid form, a lycanthrope's body would revert to its natural humanoid form.",
            "Mental Effects": "Once the transformation was complete, an afflicted lycanthrope's personality would be subsumed and overtaken by a ravenous, predatory mindset until they returned to their original form. This altered state of personality slightly varied between strains of lycanthropy, incorporating behavioral aspects of their strain's animal. This personality typically retained all the memories possessed by their humanoid state.\n\nWhen an afflicted lycanthrope finally did return to their base humanoid form, their memories of the time spent in their animal or hybrid forms was either hazy or outright forgotten, as were any memories of the pain they experienced during the process of transfiguring between states and of the transformation process itself. If an afflicted did manage to retain memories of the time spent in their animal or hybrid form they would be indistinct and surreal, as if one were recalling a nightmare.\n\nBy contrast, true lycanthropes and silverstars retained their personality in their animal or hybrid forms and their memories of the time spent in either form remained intact in their humanoid forms.",
            "Vulnerabilities": "Lycanthropy brought with it a tremendous resilience to most forms of damage, that was generally seen and known to be overcome only by [[magic]] and [[silver]]ed weaponry.  However, they could also be injured and poisoned by the gemstone [[variscite]]. And some monster hunters, such as van Richten{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Three}} found that all lycanthropes suffered from at least one or more non-magical vulnerabilities that varied between each phenotype, and in some cases between individuals. This vulnerability was a severe allergy to a specific type of plant and mineral, which they would be sensitive to in their humanoid, hybrid, and animal form. Low doses could incapacitate or weaken them, while greater doses could prove deadly.\n\n;Known Lycanthrope Allergies\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!Phenotype \n!Mineral\n!Plant\n|-\n|[[Werebadger]]\n|[[Silver]]\n|[[Poppy]]\n|-\n|[[Werebat]]\n|[[Silver]]\n|[[Skullcap mushroom]]\n|-\n|[[Werebear]]\n|[[Cold iron]]\n|[[Belladonna]]\n|-\n|[[Wereboar]]\n|[[Silver]]\n|[[Camphor]]\n|-\n|[[Werecrocodile]]\n|[[Flint]]\n|[[Mandrake]]\n|-\n|[[Werefox]]\n|[[:Category:Canines|Canine]] bones\n|[[Juniper]] berry\n|-\n|[[Werejackal]]\n|[[Copper]]\n|[[Fennel]]\n|-\n|[[Werepanther]]\n|[[Amber]]\n|[[Catnip]]\n|-\n|[[Wererat]]\n|[[Silver]]\n|[[Poison ivy]]\n|-\n|[[Wereseal]]\n|[[Whale]] bone or [[ivory]]\n|[[Amaranth]]\n|-\n|[[Wereshark]]\n|Petrified wood\n|[[Mangrove]] leaves\n|-\n|[[Weretiger]]\n|[[Obsidian]]\n|[[Ginseng]]\n|-\n|[[Werewolf]]\n|[[Silver]]\n|[[Wolfsbane]]\n|-\n|}\n\nNotably, through a boon with their goddess [[Selûne]], lycanthrope silverstars lacked the famed vulnerability to silver."

            "Treatment in Ravenloft": "The process of curing an individual afflicted with lycanthropy was a far more arduous and difficult task in the [[Domains of Dread]] then it was on the [[Prime Material plane]]. Unlike on Prime Material worlds, belladonna in Ravenloft lacked the ability to cure lycanthropy.\n\nIn ''Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts'', the eponymous monster hunter observed that throughout his travels of Ravenloft there were usually three distinct phases to the curative process. The first was to hunt down and kill what Van Richten referred to as the \"progenitor\", the true lycanthrope that started the chain of infection or directly infected a victim, having the infected perform some kind of atonement for the evils they committed while transformed,<ref> and finally having a [[priest]] cast ''[[atonement]]'', ''cure disease'', and ''remove curse'' on the victim in quick succession while the victim was transformed.<ref>\n\nWhen the [[werewolf]] [[Rengard Boltsmann]] was chosen by the Dark Powers to be a new darklord, dragging the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] and nearby parts of [[the Vast]] into Ravenloft to become his domain,<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Dogs of War|7,9}} it was this three stage process that was used to cure him.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Dogs of War|26-27}}"

        "Rumors & Legends": "Lycanthropy was mired in misconceptions as there existed several myths, legends, and folktales surrounding the condition.<ref> For example, one often quoted folktale in the Domains of Dread claimed that the condition only lasted for 15 or so years as the \"animal inside\" would allegedly die of old age.<ref>"
