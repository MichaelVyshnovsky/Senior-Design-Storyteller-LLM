        "mainbody": "'''''Astralomitis''''' was a [[disease]] that affected [[astral dragon]]s.{{Cite dragon/134/The Dragon's Bestiary: Dragons of earth, sea, and space|11}}",
        "Acquisition": "Considered rare and unusual, ''astralomitis'' was more common amongst astral dragons who switched between [[planes]] frequently.",
        "Effects": "The disease inhibited an astral dragon's ability to travel the planes via ''[[plane shift]]''. If an astral dragon was on a plane other than the [[Astral Plane]] when struck by ''astralomitis'', it was unable to return, and there was a chance that insanity would ensue. It lost the ability to cast any [[spell]]s in this state and ferociously attacked any creatures nearby, with its madness lending it greater force, while its breath weapon functioned as normal. This state could last for two to five days, and resulted in the death of the dragon, with it collapsing and dying in less than four hours.",
        "Treatment": "If the infected dragon could somehow return to the Astral Plane before its death (such as via a ''[[portal]]'' or another's aid), the sickness and insanity slowly diminished, but it was left unable to switch planes. The disease had no known cure except for a wish spell."
