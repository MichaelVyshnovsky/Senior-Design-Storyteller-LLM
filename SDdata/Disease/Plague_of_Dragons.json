        "mainbody": "The '''Plague of Dragons''', also known as the '''Dragons' Plague''', was a [[disease]] that struck [[Calimshan]] in the 9{{th}} century [[DR]] and the lands around the [[Inner Sea]] in the early 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Symptoms": "It caused the infected individuals' skin to scale and flake painfully, their hair to fall out, and their minds to plunge into madness.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1019}}, the disease struck Calimshan in what came to be known as the Dragons' Plague. It was centered in [[Calimport]] and [[Keltar]], and led to the deaths about 1 in 20 people across Calimshan. It hit Calimport especially hard, where the disease's ruinous effect on folks' appearances caused them to lose social standing, thus putting them at greater risk: as much as 16% of the city died during the outbreak.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1317}}, the disease was part of the [[Great Plague of the Inner Sea]]. It ravaged the population of the [[Vilhon Reach]], while others at the time accused a [[dragon]] known as the [[Wandering Wyrm]] that spread diseases as it journeyed around the Inner Sea, with the disease striking the northern coast of [[Chessenta]], a different disease appearing in [[Aglarond]], and a third in [[Impiltur]], where knights sent to battle the wyrm returning as maggot-infested [[undead]]. Some attributed this to the machinations of the [[Red Wizards]], others to the work of [[Talona]], Mother of All Plagues.\n\nHowever, rather than reacting with fear and shunning, authorities and priests in the Vilhon Reach responded with calm and rational research. [[Cleric]]s of different faiths all banded together to cure the disease and stop its spread, with relatively few deaths. By [[1323 DR]], the Plague of Dragons was virtually eradicated from Vilhon.\n\nOverall, the plague took the lives of many of the inhabitants of Chessenta and [[Unther]], where it raged for one more year, until [[1324 DR]]. The lands of [[Mulhorand]] remained mostly unaffected by the plague and [[Thay]] avoided being infected by leaving the [[Wizards' Reach]]."
