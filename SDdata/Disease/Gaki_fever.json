        "mainbody": "'''Gaki fever''' was a fatal wasting [[disease]] inflicted by [[shikki-gaki]] on their victims.",
        "Acquisition": "Gaki fever was contracted from injuries inflicted by the claws of a shikki-gaki, Symptoms would begin to manifest within two hours after an infection took root, and possibly as soon as twenty minutes.",
        "Effects": "Sufferers of gaki fever experienced delirium, intense fever and chills, exhaustion, and physical wasting. They were unable to think clearly (such as to cast [[spell]]s), unable to engage in any strenuous physical activity (even moving quickly was impossible), and experienced a steady degradation of their well-being over the course of the following hours. The disease disrupted the body's natural rest and recovery processes, and even caused the sufferer to resist the effects of most healing [[magic]]. If they survived, the disease caused sufferers to waste away over the following days as their stamina was depleted.",
        "Treatment": "With great luck, a healthy individual could stave off the fatal final stages of gaki fever, in which case the disease would go away after two to five days of infection. However, in general the disease could only be cured by the use of a ''[[remove disease]]'' spell or similar magic. Only once the disease had been removed in this way could the individual begin to rest or to receive the benefits of other healing spells."
