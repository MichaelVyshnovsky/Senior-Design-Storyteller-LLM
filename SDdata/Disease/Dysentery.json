Those infected with dysentery found themselves physically drained, reducing their strength and fortitude, impacting their abilities in combat, and leaving them unable to travel more than 2 hours at a time without stopping for a 10 minute rest.\nIn the Heartlands, dysentery was alleviated with blueleaf tea, made from the leaves of the bitterhedge plant. blackberry, ipecac, and quince. Some forms of dysentery would go away after four days or fewer.\nClouds of biting insects within the Momoben Forest of Wa were known to infect travelers with a form of dysentery. It was advisable to carry a torch to scare them away."
