        "Effects": "Afflicted individuals' skin turned a gray color and they suffered from seizures, blindness, and bleeding. Those who died from the disease died of the bleeding.",
        "History": "The plague largely struck [[Keltar]], [[Manshaka]], and [[Volothamp]]. As much as 9% of the population in these areas died, although many of them did not succumb to the disease but were slain in a vain attempt to prevent the spread of the plague.\n\nThe city of [[Calimport]] was spared an outbreak of the plague, although it still lost 0.2% of its population because of citizens contracting the illness while travelling."
