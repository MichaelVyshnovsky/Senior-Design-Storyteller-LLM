Those who died from the disease died of the bleeding.\nThe plague largely struck Keltar, Manshaka, and Volothamp. As much as 9% of the population in these areas died, although many of them did not succumb to the disease but were slain in a vain attempt to prevent the spread of the plague.\nThe city of Calimport was spared an outbreak of the plague, although it still lost 0.2% of its population because of citizens contracting the illness while travelling."
