        "mainbody": "'''Influenza''', commonly called the '''flu''' and also known as '''grippe''', was a notable non-[[magic]]al [[disease]] that was present on [[Toril]].",
        "Acquisition": "Influenza was infectious, and an influenza [[plague]] could sweep through a realm, seeming to travel at a rate of {{SI|20|miles|k|long=yes}} per day.{{Cite dragon/40/Believe it or not, Fantasy has reality|54}} Travelers were advised that they could catch the flu when traveling in cold and/or heavily rainy weather.{{Cite dragon/15/Weather in the Wilderness|14-15}}<ref group=\"note\">It is a common misconception that the flu arises from cold weather or a chill. This information is included for faithfulness to the source text and setting. It could also be caught passively while in populated areas, especially by those in poor health. Unlike some diseases, a prior case of influenza did not prevent reinfection.",
        "Effects": "The flu left infected individuals bedridden and could result in death. \n\nAbout 1 in 5 who became infected in a bad influenza outbreak might die, with the survivors being completely incapacitated or weakened for about a [[tenday]] and a half. Influenza plagues could wipe out as much as 10% of a population, with [[human]]s being notably susceptible. Even so, it was said generally to be one of the least dangerous infectious diseases.",
        "Treatment": "It was said that virulent plagues of influenza were resistant to magical cures, such as [[spells]] or [[potion]]s.{{Cite dragon/40/Believe it or not, Fantasy has reality|55}}"
