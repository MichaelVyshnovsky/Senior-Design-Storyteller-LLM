Travelers were advised that they could catch the flu when traveling in cold and/or heavily rainy weather.It is a common misconception that the flu arises from cold weather or a chill. This information is included for faithfulness to the source text and setting. It could also be caught passively while in populated areas, especially by those in poor health. Unlike some diseases, a prior case of influenza did not prevent reinfection.\nThe flu left infected individuals bedridden and could result in death. \nAbout 1 in 5 who became infected in a bad influenza outbreak might die, with the survivors being completely incapacitated or weakened for about a tenday and a half. Influenza plagues could wipe out as much as 10% of a population, with humans being notably susceptible. Even so, it was said generally to be one of the least dangerous infectious diseases.\nIt was said that virulent plagues of influenza were resistant to magical cures, such as spells or potions."
