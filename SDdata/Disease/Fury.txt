The Fury was a plague caused by the demon Scour.
Victims were infected through the bite of an infected creature and developed oozing sores and strange crimson crystalline growths.
Those infected became increasingly aggressive and, if they didnt die in a fight, eventually lost their minds. When victims died, a swarm of mutated vermin often emerged from the victims body.
In 1480 DR the plague reached epidemic stage in Luskan although the paladin Kalen Dren and compatriots destroyed Scour, ending the plague.
