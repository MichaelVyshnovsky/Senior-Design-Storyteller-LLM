        "mainbody": "The '''Panicked Plague''' was a disease of the skin that afflicted the city of [[Mussum]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the 5{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Effects": "The disease affected a victim's skin, turning it light green and covering it with welts and abscesses. Natural and magical treatments could do nothing to stop it. The disease killed quite quickly, perhaps in a day or less.",
        "History": "In early spring of the [[472 DR|Year of Full Cellars, 472 DR]], the city of Mussum was struck by the Panicked Plague. Over the course of a single night, known as the \"Eve of the Panicked Plague\", over three-quarters of the population suddenly perished. The terrified survivors abandoned the city. Mussum remained plague-ridden even into the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], with those venturing into the city still afflicted and slain by the unexplained disease, with their bodies found beside the road."
