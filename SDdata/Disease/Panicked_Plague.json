        "mainbody": "The Panicked Plague was a disease of the skin that afflicted the city of Mussum in the Vilhon Reach in the 5 century DR.\nThe disease affected a victims skin, turning it light green and covering it with welts and abscesses. Natural and magical treatments could do nothing to stop it. The disease killed quite quickly, perhaps in a day or less.\nIn early spring of the Year of Full Cellars, 472 DR, the city of Mussum was struck by the Panicked Plague. Over the course of a single night, known as the \"Eve of the Panicked Plague\", over three-quarters of the population suddenly perished. The terrified survivors abandoned the city. Mussum remained plague-ridden even into the mid-to-late 14 century DR, with those venturing into the city still afflicted and slain by the unexplained disease, with their bodies found beside the road."
