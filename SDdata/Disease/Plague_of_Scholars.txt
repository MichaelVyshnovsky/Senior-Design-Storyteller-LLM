The Plague of Scholars was a disease outbreak that spread across the Lands of Intrigue and other parts of south Faerûn in the .
The disease was contracted from exposure to a poison which had been used to contaminate writing supplies, namely ink and quills. 
The Plague of Scholars first caused lethargy and heavy sleep. As it progressed, it led to coma and ultimately death.
The disease was caused after some unknown faction poisoned vast amounts of the ink and quills used by businesspeople, scholars, and scribes across southern Faerûn as far north as Baldurs Gate. One in five people died of the disease across nearly every city in southern Faerûn.
When the disease struck Calimport in Calimshan, about one in ten people died of the disease.
