The '''Plague of Scholars''' was a [[disease]] outbreak that spread across the [[Lands of Intrigue]] and other parts of [[south Faer没n]] in the {{YearlinkName|-16}}.

==Acquisition==
The disease was contracted from exposure to a [[poison]] which had been used to contaminate writing supplies, namely [[ink]] and [[quill]]s. 

==Effects==
The Plague of Scholars first caused lethargy and heavy sleep. As it progressed, it led to coma and ultimately death.

==History==
The disease was caused after some unknown faction poisoned vast amounts of the ink and quills used by [[:Category:Businesspeople|businesspeople]], [[:Category:Scholars|scholars]], and [[:Category:Scribes|scribes]] across southern Faer没n as far north as [[Baldur's Gate]]. One in five people died of the disease across nearly every city in southern Faer没n.

When the disease struck [[Calimport]] in [[Calimshan]], about one in ten people died of the disease.
