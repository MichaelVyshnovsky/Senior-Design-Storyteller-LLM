'''Whooping cough''' was a mundane infectious [[disease]].

==History==
The disease was found in the [[Shining South]]'s [[hin]] nation of [[Luiren]], and the halflings had learned a special skill of medicinal cooking that involved making curative foods using [[Luiren spring cheese]]. Apprentice cooks knew how to prepare meals that could cure many normal diseases, including whooping cough.
