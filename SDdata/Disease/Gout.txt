'''Gout''' was a [[disease]] that caused pain. An individual suffering from gout could be said to be "'''gouty'''".

==Acquisition==
Gout was thought to be caused by overeating.

==Effects==
Gout caused great discomfort and pain,<ref group="note">While this is true of gout, Benelaius is speaking generally and possibly exaggerating as part of a ruse to get Tobald to remove his clothes. As such, a Faer√ªnian physician's knowledge of gout remains uncertain. It could cause a limp if it affected the toes.

If untreated or improperly treated, gout would progress and worsen over time.

==Treatment==
Sufferers of gout might be recommended to modify their diet, such as by eating less and particularly by consuming less [[ale]] and [[red meat]].

[[Frankincense]] was generally thought to be useful for curing gout. [[Crocus|Autumn crocus]] was used in the [[Western Heartlands]] to make a [[tincture]] to treat the condition,

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Mayor [[Tobald]] of [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], suffered from gout&mdash;notably in his big toe&mdash;despite the efforts of the local doctor, [[Braum]], and the [[wizard]] [[Benelaius]]. Braum advised Tobald to eat less, but the mayor complained this was an absurd thing for a physician to say. Braum also prescribed snake dung salve, of which Tobald was equally scathing.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a [[blacksmith]] named [[Sampson]] from [[Moonhaven]] suffered from gout.
