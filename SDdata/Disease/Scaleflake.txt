'''Scaleflake''' was a [[disease]] found only in the [[Underdark]].

==Acquisition==
Scaleflake was contracted by coming into contact with water tainted with the disease, such as by swimming or wading. Any creature that entered such water could become infected, but the disease was most common among aquatic or reptilian creatures who lived in water.

==Effects==
Scaleflake caused oozing and smelly pustules to swell up all across the sufferer's skin, scales, and/or other bodily surfaces. This disgusting affliction steadily deteriorated their physical appearance, leading them to increasingly socially disadvantaged. Sufficiently advanced scaleflake could render the sufferer catatonic.

With luck, a healthy individual could recover from scaleflake in a matter of days.
