        "mainbody": "ockjaw was a deadly infection and disease that caused slowed reflexes and paralysis.\nThe disease could be contracted after being bitten by a lockjaw-infected creature. Some of these carriers could spread the disease despite being immune to it themselves, such as the werecrocodiles of Chessenta. \nIt could also be contracted by having certain impurities introduced to the bloodstream. A special poison consisting of dung and blood was utilized by ninja to induce lockjaw.\nThe initial stages of the disease were characterized by increasingly slowed reflexes, which would eventually advance to complete immobilization of the infected individual. Ultimately, lockjaw resulted in death.\nWhile it was possible to fight off the infection in its early stages, it required magical intervention once the disease had advanced to immobilization. Remove affliction was a reliable cure, but other treatments that could reverse petrification could also be viable."
