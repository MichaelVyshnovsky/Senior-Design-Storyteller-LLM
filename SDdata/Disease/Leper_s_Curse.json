        "History": "When the plague struck in 354 DR, it hit every city in the Shoon Imperium and caused widespread death and madness.\n\nSeizing on an opportunity presented by the terrible affliction, the Shoon Imperium sent its infected soldiers on suicide missions against [[elf]] encampments in [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]]. Unable to feel pain, these troops were highly effective.\n\nAll told, about 19% of the population died in the plague, including 33% of the population of [[Calimport]]."
