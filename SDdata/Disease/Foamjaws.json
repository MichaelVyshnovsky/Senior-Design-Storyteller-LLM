        "mainbody": "oamjaws, also known as rabies and as darrdartha in Elven, was a type of natural disease that could be found in the Realms.\nThis disease was carried by both humanoids and various animals who could spread it to others by biting them. It was not widespread among either group, as nine in ten creatures were immune to it. However, those immune to foamjaws still acted as carriers and could still spread it with their bites.\nThose who had survived the disease could acquire it again.\nThe disease was fatal unless treated and cured. Symptoms generally manifested within 10 days of exposure, and an infected individual was usually dead within another 10 days. \nThis disease ravaged the minds of those affected. The onset of foamjaws was characterized by a \"red fog\" settling over the mind and affecting the edges of sight. Infected individuals became irritable and quick to anger, with anything from a loud noise to being awoken at night potentially sending them into a blind rage that would not abate unless they were knocked unconscious or killed. Furthermore, the disease rendered them unwilling to eat or drink anything.\nIn addition to magical means of curing disease, such as the cure disease spell, there were a variety of herbs that could be eaten to cure foamjaws. The two most effective were foambane and quarrada. Others included the cave mushroom fire eyes and a drinkable quaff made from boiling amthannas. Because an infected individual refused to eat or drink, any herbal remedy had to be forcibly fed to them.\nDue to nine in ten creatures being immune to foamjaws but still acting as carriers, over time goblins and orcs gained a folkloric reputation among humans for having bites that \"carry poison\".\nIn the 14 century DR, many of the animals that inhabited the Vast Swamp were carriers of rabies. Giant bats were particularly notable carries, including those found within the city of Kuo Meilans subterranean zoo, those living within caverns on the side of Mount Hotenow, and those that dwelt in the mountains of The Vast.\nJarbos were known to become infected with a \"foaming sickness\" akin to rabies, but their bites did not necessarily cause rabies in humanoids."
