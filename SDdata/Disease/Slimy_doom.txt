'''Slimy doom''' was a serious [[disease]] that could cause permanent damage to the body as the internal organs turned to goo or slime.

==Acquisition==
Slimy doom was caused by parasites which were said to have originated in the [[Abyss]]. and was transmissible by contact with the infectious goo that was created as a result of the attack on a host body. and that the disease could contaminate drinking water and plants. Any crops or livestock infected by slimy doom were unfit for consumption.

[[Grisgol]]s could spread the disease via a dust of mold and spores released from their bodies whenever they were struck with a blunt weapon.

Slimy doom was one of several diseases that could be inflicted using the ''[[contagion]]'' spell. It was also known to be bestowed as a punishment by [[night hag]]s as well as evil [[deities]], such as [[Lolth]].

==Effects==
Symptoms began to manifest after just one day of infection predominantly from the eyes, gums, nose, and other soft tissues. 

With luck, a healthy immune system could fight off the disease in a matter of days, although it was not possible to recover from the permanent damage to the organs without the assistance of [[magical]] healing. However, if the disease worsened, the bleeding was joined by dark and splotchy bruises, which would then progress to open wounds all over the body as the parasites reduced the host's organs into slime, effectively turning the host into goo from the inside-out. At this stage, any injury suffered by the host could caused extensive and ongoing damage to the body, and could hasten their ultimate liquification into infectious slime.

Plants contaminated with the disease also would liquify, turning yellow and rapidly wilted as they dissolved and rotted.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], slimy doom was among the diseases that one could potentially contract from trudging through the sewage of the [[Mulmaster/Sewers|sewers of Mulmaster]]. It could also be encountered in the [[Underdark]].

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a coven of night hags known as the [[Sewn Sisters]] would inflict slimy doom upon mortals who broke promises to them.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that slimy doom could be inflicted on an entire region through the use of a terrible [[Epic magic|epic ritual]].
