'''All-consuming wasting''' was a [[magical]] [[disease]] that transformed the afflicted into an [[all-consuming hunger]].

==Acquisition==
The disease was primarily inflicted when an all-consuming hunger swarmed a victim, If the infection took root, symptoms began to manifest in about one day.

==Effects==
All-consuming wasting was said to be similar to [[mummy rot]]. It could take several days for the disease to kill an infected individual, at which point their rotten body parts would animate as a new all-consuming hunger less than half a minute later.

==Treatment==
While a strong immune system&mdash;and a great deal of luck&mdash;could stave off the progression of the disease, only [[magic]]al healing, such as ''[[remove disease]]'', could allow an infected individual to recover from all-consuming wasting.

==History==
Sometime prior to the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Keeper of Thaal]] devised a means to create unique undead abominations that could spread all-consuming wasting. The only known success was achieved using the corpse of a [[bard]] named [[Askilion]].
