'''Glow fever''' was a deadly wasting disease that could be contracted by being bitten by the firefly-like insects that lived in the fortress of [[Glaur]] in [[Gontal]].{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|84}} 

==Effects==
In the initial stages, the bodies of those afflicted glowed with a yellow-green bioluminescence similar to that of the of the swarming insects. Victims who died of this disease had their bodies mutated into a new swarm, which usually abandoned the place of their deaths to seek for its fellows in Glaur.
