'''Filth fever''' was a sickness characterized by fever, slowness of movement, and physical weakness. It was spread by bites from contaminated animals, and could be deadly if left untreated.

==Acquisition==
The disease was most commonly contracted from the bites of creatures like [[rat]]s, [[dire rat]]s, [[otyugh]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[wererat]]s. It could also be acquired if an injury became infected due to exposure to a filthy environment, or a battlefield.

Filth fever was also inflicted by injuries from a ''[[diseased (weapon quality)|diseased]]'' weapon. It was one of several diseases that could be inflicted using the ''[[contagion]]'' spell.

==Effects==
Those suffering from filth fever experienced a raging fever that impacted their whole body, sometimes accompanied alternatingly with freezing chills. The disease caused a steady degradation of both reflexes, mobility, and stamina, and made it difficult for the infected individual to complete tasks that involved physical strength or exertion&mdash;including swinging a weapon&mdash;as well as interfered with the body's natural healing. In extreme cases, sufferers would simply waste away, and could become so weak that they died.

With luck, a healthy immune system could fight off the disease in a matter of days.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], filth fever was among the diseases that one could potentially contract from trudging through the sewage of the sewers beneath [[Mulmaster/Sewers|Mulmaster]] and [[Waterdeep/Sewers|Waterdeep]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[diseased (weapon quality)|magic weapon]]s that could inflict filth fever were favored among [[Talontar]] [[blightlord]]s as well as some of the more cruel [[Red Wizards of Thay]].

During the [[Shadovarâ€“Thay War]], the [[Charnel Fields]] of [[Surcross]] became so choked with corpses and rot that the area became a hotbed for a unique strain of filth fever.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Dead Rats]]&mdash;a gang of wererats active in [[Luskan]] and [[Neverwinter]]&mdash;were known to be carriers of filth fever.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} a magically animated puppet of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] was purportedly researching a cure for filth fever in the [[Arcane Chambers]] of [[Undermountain]], but was in fact just randomly mixing harmless substances.
