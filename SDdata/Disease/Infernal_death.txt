The Infernal Death was a disease outbreak that struck the Shoon Imperium in the 4 century DR.
Afflicted individuals experienced mania and mild fevers. There was also a noticeable heightening of the color in infected individuals eyes, hair, and skin, which gave the false impression that they were healthy. Death could then occur suddenly.
The most terrifying symptom was that once a victim died, their corpse would combust and could start fires.
The plague struck during the summer of the , across Calimshan and Tethyr, notably in Calimport, Keltar, Memnon, Myratma, Shoonach, and Teshburl. As much as 9% of the population in these areas died, although the death toll was only 4% in Calimport.
As the plague-filled summer continued, the accumulation of combusting bodies led to the Plague Fires in Calimport.
