        "mainbody": "Ghoul Gut was a magical gastrointestinal disease.\nGhoul Gut was contracted by consuming parts of ghouls, but more commonly from drinking water which had been contaminated with parts of ghouls.\nThe disease incubated quickly, with symptoms generally appearing during the first nights sleep following exposure. Onset was accelerated by excitement, so stress or exertion could bring on the symptoms prematurely.\nVictims experienced extreme gastrointestinal distress, including heartburn, cramping, and bowel distress. During a bout of Ghoul Gut, a victims intestines produced an audible gurgling that was said to sound like angry ghouls. Initial onset was very painful and magically injurious, and prolonged bouts of Ghoul Gut could be fatal. The discomfort of the disease made any kind of resting nearly impossible, and disrupted all natural healing.\nThe disease could be shaken off on its own. It was also possible for a caregiver to effectively alleviate the symptoms by monitoring and tending to the sufferer constantly over an eight hour period."
