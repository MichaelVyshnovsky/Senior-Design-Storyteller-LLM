'''Sewer plague''' was a colloquial term for common [[disease]]s frequently encountered in [[sewer]]s, swamps, dumps, stagnant waters, and other filthy or fetid places.

==Acquisition==
Because "sewer plague" was a general term, it did not necessarily refer to diseases with a single vector of infection. Some sewer plagues were spread by bites from sewer-dwelling creatures such as [[rat]]s, [[otyugh]]s, or the [[undead]]. In other cases, mere exposure to contaminated offal, open sewage, or other waste for at least one minute was sufficient to risk infection. Individuals who were injured had a much greater risk of contracting sewer plagues while in contaminated environments.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|8}}

An individual exposed to and infected with a sewer plague would begin showing symptoms within four days.

==Effects==
Sufferers of sewer plagues generally experienced cramping and fatigue, which could progress into extreme exhaustion, interference with the body's natural rest and recovery processes, and ultimately even death.

==Treatment==
Healthy individuals could fight off the disease naturally.

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], sewer plagues were notable in the [[sewers of Waterdeep]] and the [[sewers of Mulmaster]].
