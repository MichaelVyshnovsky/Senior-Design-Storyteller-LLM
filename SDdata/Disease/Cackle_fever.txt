'''Cackle fever''', also known as "'''the shrieks'''", was a [[disease]] that caused uncontrollable and debilitating fits of laughter. 

==Acquisition==
The disease spread through the air{{Cite adventurers league/The Breath of Life|18}} It was highly contagious such that merely standing within {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} of an infected individual ran the risk of immediately catching it. Cackle fever only affected and spread between [[humanoid]]s. [[Gnome]]s were immune to the disease for some unknown reason, but could still act as asymptomatic carriers of it. 

It was also possible to contract cackle fever from [[ghost]]s and from noxious gasses in the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]].

Cackle fever was one of several diseases that could be inflicted using the ''[[contagion]]'' spell.

==Effects==
Symptoms manifested within a day, The most severe bouts of laughter could be completely debilitating and even cause psychological harm: these erupted in response to stressful or frightening situations, such as combat, being injured, or having a nightmare.

As the disease progressed, it caused a steady deterioration in willpower, perceptiveness, and common sense, and ultimately it could leave sufferers fully catatonic or cause them to go mad. 

==Treatment==
Usually, healthy individuals could slowly but surely fight off the disease naturally.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Lady in Flames|37}} 

==History==
Cackle fever was one of many diseases inflicted on the soldiers fighting in the [[Rotting War]] at the [[Fields of Nun]] in {{YearlinkName|902}}. Centuries later, some roving [[undead]] still carried the disease.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Trail of Tears:The Scourge of Pestilence}}

During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], cackle fever could be encountered in the [[Underdark]]. During this same period, [[Black Wagon Alley]] in [[Waterdeep]] was haunted by a ghostly [[plague wagon]] that was said to spread cackle fever to those that beheld it.

At some point prior to the late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[lich]] [[Zzarka]] created a disease she called "[[cacklefire]]" by combining cackle fever and [[mindfire]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Strongholds of Undeath Portals}}

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the disease was present on [[Avernus]]. The gnome [[archmage]] [[Pingle]] attended a grand ball hosted by the [[devil]] [[Qirozz]] and unknowingly spread it among the humanoid guests.
