The pactbroken curse was a magical, parasitic disease that affected members of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa who pledged and then broke a Pact of the Iron Ring.
Upon breaking an oath sworn under the Pact of the Iron Ring, a Warlock Knight was labeled "pactbroken" by their peers, and a worm-like parasite would begin invading their body and targeting their brain.It was unclear whether the mere act of breaking the pact was sufficient to spawn the parasite, or if the condemnation by other Warlock Knights was also necessary to begin the curse.
Victims of the parasite began to steadily lose the ability to regain their stamina. The parasite progressed relatively slowly, attacking the brain and disrupting almost every activity that the victim attempted to undertake. Eventually, the victim would succumb to the parasite as it reached maturity deep in their brain. At this point, their body would disintegrate into purple-tinged iron dust.
The parasite could not be overcome or removed by natural means, and the curse was fatal without the intervention of magical healing or curing, most notably through a ritual to remove affliction. Curiously, the oath sworn under the Pact of the Iron Ring itself served as the initial stages of the disease, and its effects could similarly be nullified by a remove affliction spell.
