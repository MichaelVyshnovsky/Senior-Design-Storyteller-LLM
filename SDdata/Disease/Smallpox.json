        "mainbody": "mallpox was a mundane infectious disease. It was regarded as one of the most dangerous non-magical diseases.\nSufferers skin became covered in pockmarks, not unlike the scars left by the spotted plague. The disease was fatal if left untreated.\nIt was possible to treat smallpox by non-magical means, although such care often took as many as 12 days Such services were offered at Mothers Cupboard, an apothecary in Ravens Bluff, who treated diseases of those who wished to avoid temples. The proprietor, \"Mother\" Josselyn Phelia, charged 50 gp per day of care as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe halflings of Luiren had developed a special skill of medicinal cooking that involved making curative foods using Luiren spring cheese, and experienced cooks knew how to prepare meals that could cure many otherwise fatal normal diseases, including smallpox."
