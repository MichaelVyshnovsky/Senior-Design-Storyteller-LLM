'''Consumption''', also known as '''tuberculosis''', was a dangerous and potentially deadly non-[[magic]]al [[disease]] that was present on [[Toril]].

==Effects==
Consumption caused the infected individual to waste away, gradually "consuming" their vitality until they expired. The disease was regarded as one of the most dangerous mundane diseases, more than even [[smallpox]] or [[spotted fever]].

==Treatment==
Attention from a caregiver or [[herbalist]] might slow the progression of consumption.

==History==
[[Gwynneth (person)|Gwynneth]], leader of the first [[human]] settlers of the [[Moonshae Isles]], died of consumption in the {{YearlinkName|141}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, seven followers of [[Talona]] led by Tessurch [[Quorl Vemmil]] unleashed a virulent form of consumption in the city of [[Keczulla]], [[Amn]]. This [[plague]] killed many citizens, and was intended to undermine the authority of [[Meisarch]] [[Thayze Selemchant]], the leader of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]]. However, their plans were intercepted, and while the outbreak was allowed to happen by the Meisarch's spies, the perpetrators were revealed to the public. An angry mob then killed them and destroyed their bodies beyond recognition.

In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, there was an outbreak of [[Dream Fever]] in [[Daggerdale]], a magical illness that caused consumption in its victims.

Following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, exposure to the [[plagueland]]s of [[Halruaa]] could cause a magical variant of the disease known as [[Halruaan consumption]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Among [[death priest]]s who worshiped [[god]]s of [[Talona|pestilence]]&mdash;sometimes called "[[plague priest]]s"&mdash;consumption was said to flow from the very breath of their toxic deities.
