'''Blinding sickness''', also known as '''river blindness''', was a [[disease]] that could cause permanent loss of vision and even death.

==Acquisition==
Blinding sickness was generally contracted by drinking water contaminated with the disease It was further known to be transmissible if tainted water came into contact with a creature's unprotected eyes, nose, or ears. Creatures who dwelt in the waters and [[sewer]]s in which the disease was pervasive tended to be immune to it.

The disease could also be acquired by inhaling the spores of a variety of white [[fungus|toadstool mushrooms]] that could be found in [[Undermountain]].

Blinding sickness was one of several diseases that could be inflicted using the ''[[contagion]]'' spell.

==Effects==
Symptoms usually began to set in after one to three days. The initial effect was a steady deterioration of the infected individual's strength, followed by loss of vision. The progression of the disease could also include a loss of stamina as well as blurry vision&mdash;which made it hard to see more than about {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}}&mdash;before advancement to total blindness. This blindness lasted until the disease was cured, but could even be permanent. Afflicted creatures' eyes turned a milky white and they felt pain in their heads, which interfered with their willpower.

The steady deterioration of the infected individual's strength and stamina was a bigger danger than the blindness as it could ultimately cause weakness to the point of death.

==Treatment==
A healthy immune system could fight off the disease in as little as two days, although any vision loss that occurred would remain. Only restorative [[magic]]s, such as ''[[lesser restoration]]'', could undo this damage.

==History==
The "red tides" of the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] carried blinding sickness.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], stagnant waters contaminated with blinding sickness could be found in places like [[Dead Orc Pass]] in the [[North]], the [[Underdark]], and [[Zakhara]]. and especially in the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers of Waterdeep]].{{Cite dungeon/126/Vampires of Waterdeep: Blood of Malar|70}}
