'''Devil chills''' was a supernatural [[disease]] spread by certain types of [[devil]]s.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Trail of Tears: Plague Bearers}}

==Acquisition==
Many types of devils could be carriers for the disease&mdash;including [[barbazu]], [[erinyes]], and [[pit fiend]]s&mdash;and such carriers did not experience any symptoms despite being contagious. The disease was spread via the bites and septic claws of infected devils, as well as by the filthy beards of the barbazu. The disease could also be contracted upon exposure to a devil's blood, and so some devils were known to smear their infected blood onto their favored weapons before battle.

==Effects==
Sufferers of devil chills experienced a steady wasting away of their physical strength.

While a healthy individual could recover naturally from devil chills, the disease was stubborn and required a longer recovery period than most other illnesses.

==History==
Devil chills was one of many diseases that could be found in the [[Underdark]].

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], three erinyes infected with devil chills&mdash;[[Alecto]], [[Tisiphone]], and [[Magaera]]&mdash;were charged with guarding a ''[[portal]]'' in the [[Fields of Nun]] that lay along the [[Trail of Tears]], a [[pilgrim]]age route for the devout of [[Tempus]]. These guardians&mdash;alongside their likewise infected barbazu minions&mdash;were tasked with imparting the lesson that war is but one way that people die, with disease being a clear and obvious alternative.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Trail of Tears:The Scourge of Pestilence}}

==Rumors & Legends==
The [[archdevil]] [[Bel]] was said to be infected with devil chills.
