Bubonic plague, also known as the black plague, was a dangerous mundane infectious disease.
The disease was highly was infectious, and could devastate a realm as it seemed to travel through at a rate of over  per day. It was possible to become infected with the disease again after recovering from a prior infection.
Symptoms of bubonic plague included buboes&mdashswollen lymph nodes on the neck, armpits, and groin that could grow to the size of apples&mdashand internal bleeding that caused black and red bruising all over the body. The disease led to a steady decline in vitality, physical strength, constitution, and reflexes, with the sufferer getting noticeably worse every six hours or so. There was only a 1 in 3 chance of survival without treatment, and death usually came within 3 to 6 days of the onset of symptoms. Those who survived were typically bedridden for a tenday and a half, and remained frail for ten to sixty days after that.
Humans, dwarves, and elves were all equally susceptible to the plague, while halflings were about 40% less likely to die of an infection.
It was said that the plague was resistant to magical cures, such as spells or potions.
