An unidentified disease affecting the skin, body, and mind broke out in the Vilhon Reach in the late 1350s DR.
The disease affected its victims in multiple ways. First, they felt drowsy and weak, with a slight loss of strength. Second, they had difficulties concentrating and could not memorize anything, including names and messages, and especially spells. But the most noticeable and unappealing symptom was the green-white patches resembling lichen that appeared on the skin.
No natural cure was found, bar a cure disease spell. The effects did fade after 2 to 5 months.
Heretofore unknown, there was an outbreak of the strange disease in the lands around the Vilhon Reach in the late 1350s DR. It spread quickly, but a cure was yet to be found.
Unusually, the alchemist Thoround of Nimpeth reported a use for the bodily fluids, that is, the spittle or blood, of humans affected by the disease. If the fluid was used in the making of ink for writing a forget spell, then the process could be made simpler and cheaper. Moreover, if the fluid was used in the ink for any spell, then the spell would disappear from the page upon casting from a spellbook in the normal mannerâ€”but would spontaneously reappear between 3 and 12 days later, provided the page remained intact.
