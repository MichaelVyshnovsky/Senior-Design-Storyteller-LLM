        "mainbody": "he so-called eating disease was a natural affliction that affected those who were born in the jungles of Chult.\nThe eating disease was quite rare and its main effect was turning skin on the affected areas to form into scale-like calluses that greatly resembled those of a serpent. The disease often affected the forearms, making it fairly noticeable when exposed.\nIn the late 14 century DR, a dark-skinned Chultan human afflicted with the disease was one of the eclectic and multi-ethnic crew of a pirate vessel, the Black Dragon, helmed by the infamous Orim Redbeard."
