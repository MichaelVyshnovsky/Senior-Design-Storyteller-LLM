Cackle fever only affected and spread between humanoids. Gnomes were immune to the disease for some unknown reason, but could still act as asymptomatic carriers of it. \nIt was also possible to contract cackle fever from ghosts and from noxious gasses in the Great Swamp of Rethild.\nCackle fever was one of several diseases that could be inflicted using the contagion spell.\nSymptoms manifested within a day, The most severe bouts of laughter could be completely debilitating and even cause psychological harm these erupted in response to stressful or frightening situations, such as combat, being injured, or having a nightmare.\nAs the disease progressed, it caused a steady deterioration in willpower, perceptiveness, and common sense, and ultimately it could leave sufferers fully catatonic or cause them to go mad. \nUsually, healthy individuals could slowly but surely fight off the disease naturally. \nCackle fever was one of many diseases inflicted on the soldiers fighting in the Rotting War at the Fields of Nun in . Centuries later, some roving undead still carried the disease.\nDuring the mid-to-late 14 century DR, cackle fever could be encountered in the Underdark. During this same period, Black Wagon Alley in Waterdeep was haunted by a ghostly plague wagon that was said to spread cackle fever to those that beheld it.\nAt some point prior to the late 14 century DR, the lich Zzarka created a disease she called \"cacklefire\" by combining cackle fever and mindfire.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the disease was present on Avernus.
