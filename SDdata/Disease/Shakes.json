        "mainbody": "The '''shakes''', also known as '''seizure''', was a [[disease]] that caused involuntary movements and spasms.",
        "Acquisition": "The disease was contagious. It spread via contact with an infected individual, and the incubation period was a mere one day.",
        "Effects": "The shakes caused the diseased person's body to shake with uncontrollable fits, tremors, and twitches, which was accompanied by a loss of agility. The disease made it difficult to execute tasks requiring finesse or reflexes. As the disease progressed, it could lead to reduced mobility and ultimately to paralysis.\n\nA healthy immune system could fight off the disease in as little as two days. Magically inflicted versions of the disease could last for seven days.",
        "History": "Unwary explorers in [[Mulmaster]] ran the risk of contracting the shakes in [[Mulmaster/Sewers|the sewers]]. The disease could also be found in the [[Underdark]].\n\nThe shakes was one of many illnesses that could be afflicted by the ''[[contagion]]'' spell. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[spell]] called ''[[contagious fog]]'' had been developed in the Underdark that caused victims of it to be infected with the shakes without any incubation period."
