        "mainbody": "The shakes, also known as seizure, was a disease that caused involuntary movements and spasms.\nThe disease was contagious. It spread via contact with an infected individual, and the incubation period was a mere one day. \nThe shakes caused the diseased persons body to shake with uncontrollable fits, tremors, and twitches, which was accompanied by a loss of agility. The disease made it difficult to execute tasks requiring finesse or reflexes. As the disease progressed, it could lead to reduced mobility and ultimately to paralysis.\nA healthy immune system could fight off the disease in as little as two days. Magically inflicted versions of the disease could last for seven days.\nUnwary explorers in Mulmaster ran the risk of contracting the shakes in the sewers. The disease could also be found in the Underdark.\nThe shakes was one of many illnesses that could be afflicted by the contagion spell. By the 14 century DR, a spell called contagious fog had been developed in the Underdark that caused victims of it to be infected with the shakes without any incubation period."
