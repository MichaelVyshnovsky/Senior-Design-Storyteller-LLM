'''Dysentery''' was a [[disease]] that was present in [[Faer√ªn]],{{cite web |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] |https://web.archive.org/web/20221127191522/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1033410368100544512|title= Ed's Twitter |date=2018-08-25 |accessdate=2022-11-27}} [[Kara-Tur]], and [[Zakhara]].

==Acquisition==
Dysentery was caused by drinking contaminated water or being bitten by disease-carrying [[insect]]s, such as [[mosquito]]s.

==Effects==
Dysentery was said to be among the more dangerous of non-[[magic]]al diseases. Those infected with dysentery found themselves physically drained, reducing their strength and fortitude, impacting their abilities in combat, and leaving them unable to travel more than 2 hours at a time without stopping for a 10 minute rest.

==Treatment==
In the [[Heartlands]], dysentery was alleviated with [[blueleaf tea]], made from the leaves of the [[bitterhedge]] plant.{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...|23}} [[blackberry]], [[ipecac]], and [[quince]]. Some forms of dysentery would go away after four days or fewer.

==Notable Carriers==
Clouds of biting insects within the [[Momoben Forest]] of [[Wa]] were known to infect travelers with a form of dysentery. It was advisable to carry a [[torch]] to scare them away.
