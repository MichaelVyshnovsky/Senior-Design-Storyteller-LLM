Softpox was a disease found only in the Underdark.
The disease could be contracted through physical contact with an infected individual.
Softpox caused the skin to become soft and swollen, rendering it tender and painful. This weakening of the skin caused sufferers to repeatedly experience severe injury for as long as they were ill. Infected creatures with naturally tough skins or hides found their natural defenses winnowing down to nothing, leaving them likewise suffering injuries from the disease.
It was virtually impossible for a normal person to fight off the disease naturally, but the injuries inflicted by the disease could be healed or recovered from on a day-by-day basis.
