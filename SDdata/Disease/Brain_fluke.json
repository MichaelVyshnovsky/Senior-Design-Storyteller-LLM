        "mainbody": "'''Brain flukes''' were very small, worm-like [[parasite]]s that infected the brains of [[humanoid]]s. They were native to the jungles of [[Chult]].",
        "Acquisition": "The brain fluke [[disease]] began when an adult brain fluke managed to tunnel its way into a host's brain, where it would ultimately conclude its life-cycle and spawn new brain flukes.",
        "Effects": "The initial symptoms began as soon as the brain fluke entered the brain, and included a loss of willpower and increased susceptibility to [[psionics|psychic]] attacks and intrusions. As the infection advanced, the host became easier to influence and to frighten, including a greater susceptibility to ''[[charm]]''- and ''[[fear]]''-type spells. Eventually, the host became effectively subservient to the brain fluke, and was unable to do much more than eat in order to nourish the parasite as it produced its offspring. After about one to two [[tenday]]s, the brain fluke spawn would burst out of the host's brain, killing it.",
        "Treatment": "It was possible to fight off a brain fluke infection naturally and with the help of mundane healing.",
        "History": "Brain fluke infection was one of the most prevalent diseases on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
