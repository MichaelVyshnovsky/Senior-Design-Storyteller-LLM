        "mainbody": "The '''Empire Plague''' was a terrible [[disease]] that ravaged and destabilized [[southeast Faerûn]] in the -4{{th}} century [[DR]]. It spread further and faster than any prior disease in [[Faerûn]]'s history,",
        "Acquisition": "The disease was spread by [[rat]]s, and proliferated quickly around the [[Shining Sea]] owing to such rats infesting [[Calishite]] merchant [[:Category:Ships|ships]].",
        "Effects": "The Empire Plague was highly contagious. Plague victims were recognizable by their red and bleeding eyes and by the weeping purple sores on their bodies.\n\nThe disease was very dangerous. As many as 3 in 10 people living in [[Calimshan]], the [[Lake of Steam]], [[Lapaliiya]], [[Tashalar]], and some [[Chult]]an ports died of the Empire Plague, including a third of the population of the city of [[Calimport]]. The disease claimed 4 in 10 members of Calimshan's ruling class, including the reigning [[Syl-pasha]], [[Khalid el Axash]], and his heirs.",
        "History": "The plague started in the {{YearlinkName|-375}}, along the southern coast of the [[Shining Sea]] before quickly spreading all around it. However, the city failed to burn, and so the Syl-pasha was forced to abandon Calimport. By the [[-374 DR|next year]], Calimport had come to be known as the \"Rogue's City\", and was home mostly to escaped [[slave]]s, [[necromancer]]s, [[rogue]]s, and [[Talontar]] [[cleric]]s intent on pillaging the city to raise a temple to [[Talona]]. By this time, Calimshan had already begun to blame [[Jhaamdath]] for the plague.\n\nTwo years after fleeing plague-stricken Lapaliiya, [[Lapal]] refugees founded [[Lhesper]] in the {{YearlinkName|-373}}.\n\nThe plague ravaged the Shining Sea region for five years. It struck Calimshan's imperial holdings hard, quickly causing their influence in the region to crumble and their control over their colonies in the Lake of Steam to be lost. While local rulers across the empire managed to maintain order throughout the plague, many of them began to assert themselves as independent city-states as they restricted trade to keep out any potential plague carriers. \n\nWhen the disease finally subsided in the {{YearlinkName|-370}}, Syl-pasha Akkab el Evyrtaan declared all residents of the Rogue's City to be either plague-carriers or traitors to Calimshan, initiating a bloody purge of Calimport. By the end of the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], the only survivors of Rogue's City are those who fled into the undercity.\n\nEven as of the {{YearlinkName|-304}}, Lapaliiya remained weakened from the outbreak, thus leaving them vulnerable when the [[yuan-ti]] of [[Serpentes]] decided to declare war on them."
