        "mainbody": "Bluerot was a disease carried by undead that affected various species of humanoids.\nWithin hours after transmission, someone afflicted bluerot rapidly grew blue boils upon their face and back. In short time they developed a fever and began to feel distinct tingling sensations in their hands and feet. In addition to those maladies, victims grew increasingly vulnerable to radiant energy.\nNot all the symptoms of bluerot were detrimental however, as the afflicted individual also gained the ability to breathe underwater.\nNumerous undead followers of Gar Shatterkeel, the leader of the Cult of the Crushing Wave, could inflict bluerot upon others with their attacks."
