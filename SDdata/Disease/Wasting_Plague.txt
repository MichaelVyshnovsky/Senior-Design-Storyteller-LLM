==Effects==
The plague was an affliction caused by [[marrashi]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[-30400 DR]], gnoll [[shaman]]s of [[Yeenoghu]] summoned marrashi from the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]] to inflict the Wasting Plague upon the [[aearee]] of Kookrui-Shara and also to blight their crops. As a result, the Aearee-Quor were decimated, and were forced to turn to the [[demon lord]] [[Pazrael]] for protection.
