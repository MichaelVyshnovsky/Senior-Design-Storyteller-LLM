The Wasting Plague was a disease inflicted on the crops of the Aearee-Quor of Kookrui-Shara by gnolls of Urgnarash at the end of the Days of Thunder.
The plague was an affliction caused by marrashi.
Circa -30400 DR, gnoll shamans of Yeenoghu summoned marrashi from the Barrens of Doom and Despair to inflict the Wasting Plague upon the aearee of Kookrui-Shara and also to blight their crops. As a result, the Aearee-Quor were decimated, and were forced to turn to the demon lord Pazrael for protection.
