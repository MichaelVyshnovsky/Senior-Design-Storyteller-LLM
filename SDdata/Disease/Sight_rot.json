        "mainbody": "Sight rot was an infection that could cause blindness in both humanoids and beasts.\nSight rot was found in swamp water. It was contracted by drinking water tainted with the disease, although simply travelling through a swampland where the disease was endemic could also risk infection. If an individual became infected, symptoms would manifest the next day.\nThe first sign of the disease was blurry vision, which was accompanied by painful bleeding from the eyes in the following days. Naturally, the disease interfered with the sufferers ability to see. This visual disruption got increasingly worse until, after 5 days, the infection resulted in total blindness.\nThe blindness caused by sight rot was permeant unless healed with magic, such as lesser restoration or heal. However, the disease could be treated in its earlier stages with the application of an ointment prepared from eyebright flowers by a skilled healer. Applying this ointment to the eyes for several hours at a time&mdashsuch as while sleeping&mdashhalted the progression of the sight rot, and three days of this treatment could cure the disease."
