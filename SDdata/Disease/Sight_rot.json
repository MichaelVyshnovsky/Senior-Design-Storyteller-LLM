        "mainbody": "'''Sight rot''' was an [[disease|infection]] that could cause blindness in both [[humanoid]]s and [[beast]]s.",
        "Acquisition": "Sight rot was found in swamp water. It was contracted by drinking water tainted with the disease, although simply travelling through a swampland where the disease was endemic could also risk infection. If an individual became infected, symptoms would manifest the next day.",
        "Effects": "The first sign of the disease was blurry vision, which was accompanied by painful bleeding from the eyes in the following days. Naturally, the disease interfered with the sufferer's ability to see. This visual disruption got increasingly worse until, after 5 days, the infection resulted in total blindness.",
        "Treatment": "The blindness caused by sight rot was permeant unless healed with [[magic]], such as ''[[lesser restoration]]'' or ''[[heal]]''. However, the disease could be treated in its earlier stages with the application of an [[medicine|ointment]] prepared from [[eyebright]] flowers by a skilled healer. Applying this ointment to the eyes for several hours at a time&mdash;such as while sleeping&mdash;halted the progression of the sight rot, and three days of this treatment could cure the disease."
