'''Winterchill fever''', also known as '''windchill fever''', '''winter fever''', '''pneumonia''', or simply '''winter chill''', was a well-known [[disease]] in [[Faerûn]], and was one of the so-called [[Five Fevers]].{{Cite dragon/412/Eye on the Realms: The Thing in the Crypt|32,34}}

==Acquisition==
For [[humanoid]]s, the disease was transmissible through the air, and symptoms manifested within 6 days. 

Extended exposure to the cold could also cause the disease, especially if precautions to stay warm were not taken.{{Cite dragon/15/Weather in the Wilderness|14}} In cold climates, ordinary [[horse]]s were prone to catch and die of the disease in a matter of days if pushed to travel. It was advised to ride heartier [[mount]]s, such as [[Rashemaar pony|Rashemaar ponies]], in such climates.

==Effects==
Sufferers of winterchill fever experienced fever but it could alternatively lead to death.

==Treatment==
Non-[[magical]] treatment of pneumonia required thrice daily ingestion of dangerously potent [[herb]]s under the frequent observation of a healer.{{Cite dragon/269/Herbcraft|39}}
