'''Lockjaw''' was a deadly infection{{Cite dragon/30/The New, Improved Ninja|14}} and [[disease]] that caused slowed reflexes and paralysis.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|76}}

==Acquisition==
The disease could be contracted after being bitten by a lockjaw-infected creature. Some of these carriers could spread the disease despite being immune to it themselves, such as the [[werecrocodile]]s of [[Chessenta]]. 

It could also be contracted by having certain impurities introduced to the bloodstream. A special [[poison]] consisting of dung and blood was utilized by [[ninja]] to induce lockjaw.

==Effects==
The initial stages of the disease were characterized by increasingly slowed reflexes, which would eventually advance to complete immobilization of the infected individual. Ultimately, lockjaw resulted in death.

==Curing==
While it was possible to fight off the infection in its early stages, it required [[magic]]al intervention once the disease had advanced to immobilization. ''[[Remove affliction]]'' was a reliable cure, but other treatments that could reverse ''[[petrification]]'' could also be viable.
