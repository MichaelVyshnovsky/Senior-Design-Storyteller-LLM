        "mainbody": "The '''Infernal Death''' was a [[disease]] outbreak that struck the [[Shoon Imperium]] in the 4{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Effects": "Afflicted individuals experienced mania and mild fevers. There was also a noticeable heightening of the color in infected individuals' eyes, hair, and skin, which gave the false impression that they were healthy. Death could then occur suddenly.\n\nThe most terrifying symptom was that once a victim died, their corpse would combust and could start fires.",
        "History": "The plague struck during the summer of the {{YearlinkName|320}}, across [[Calimshan]] and [[Tethyr]], notably in [[Calimport]], [[Keltar]], [[Memnon]], [[Myratma]], [[Shoonach]], and [[Teshburl]]. As much as 9% of the population in these areas died, although the death toll was only 4% in Calimport.\n\nAs the plague-filled summer continued, the accumulation of combusting bodies led to the [[Plague Fires]] in Calimport."
