The '''Moon Plague''' was an outbreak of [[lycanthropy]] that struck [[Calimport]] in the {{YearlinkName|701}}.

==Effects==
People in Calimport transformed into a variety of [[lycanthrope]]s, with [[wereboar]]s, [[weretiger]]s, and [[werewolves]] being most common.

==History==
The plague started after three weretigers and two werewolves entered the city. Through the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it remained unknown what had drawn these lycanthropes to the city.

The Moon Plague lasted through the months of [[Tarsakh]] and [[Mirtul]] of 701 DR. Following the full moon in Mirtul, many of the lycanthropes depart the city for the [[Shaar]] and [[Tashalar]] apparently to continue spreading their affliction. Several lycanthropes remain in [[Calimport Muzad]] beneath the city's streets.
