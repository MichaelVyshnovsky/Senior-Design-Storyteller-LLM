Cemetery rot was a disease that transformed the infected individual into a zombie.
Cemetery rot was contracted via a bite from the corrupted and rotting undead remains of small animals, such as dogs or cats.
An infected individual immediately found themselves immune to magical healing. If they were not able to fight off the disease, it would cause their body to rot and steadily deteriorate. If they died of the disease, they then rose as a mindless zombie that hungered for flesh.
The undead carriers of cemetery rot were most often created as the result of botched raise dead spells (or similar magics) that had been cast to revive a pet.
