        "mainbody": "'''Gangrene''', or '''darkrot''', was the death of body tissues caused by prolonged lack of blood flow, characterized by putrification, foul smell, and blackened color.\n\n{{quote|''Many [[warrior]]s fear gangrene more than the [[sword]]. When \"the rots\" sets in, the only recourse at times lay in drastic measures.''|From the pages of ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.}}",
        "Acquisition": "Gangrene was considered one of the most dangerous natural diseases as it could be contracted via a simple piercing or slashing wound if left untreated. Gangrene could set in a short period of time as 24 hours. [[Frostbite (condition)|Frostbite]] was just as dangerous. Frozen tissue stopped blood flow which eventually led to gangrene.\n\nSome dangerous [[undead]] creatures like [[angel of decay|angels of decay]] and [[plague blight]]s could spread gangrene with a mere touch. Some living creatures, such as [[shadowdrake]]s were known to inflict darkrot.\n\nSome rare and unlucky individuals who wronged the [[Vistani]] folk of [[Barovia]] were sentenced to death by some of the most horrific way. One such death was inflicted upon a criminal via a full-body gangrene.<ref>{{Cite book| author =Â David Wise| title = Van Richten's Monster Hunter's Compendium Vol.III| short_story = | date = | editor = Jonatha Ariadne Caspin| publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = 0-7869-1613-3| pages = 163| chapter = }}\n\nDarkrot was a common danger in the [[Rat Hills]] outside the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Effects": "Once gangrene set in, afflicted flesh sprouted blackened patches within one or two days after infection. Within two to twelve days, the breathing of the afflicted became labored and hissing. As the infection spread, their bodies weakened until they reached the full-system shock as early as seven days after infection. If left untreated, death was inevitable.",

He was rescued by the [[Veiled Ones]] and, eventually, had his grave wounds healed via [[Mystra]] healing blessings.\n* [[Halana Shauluth]], the proprietor of aptly-named [[Halana Shauluth's]] bakery in [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]]. She lost her hand to gangrene, which ended her adventuring career and led her to open the popular and successful bakery business.\n* [[Yousouf]], of [[Yousouf's Grocery]] a retired adventurer whose friend and healer [[Ihre]] was forced to amputate his gangrenous toes following nasty frostbite."
