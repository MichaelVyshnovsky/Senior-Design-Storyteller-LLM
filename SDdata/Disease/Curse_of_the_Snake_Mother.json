        "mainbody": "The Curse of the Snake Mother was a cursed affliction bestowed by the dreaded Snake Mother, the yuan-ti leader on the Malatran Plateau.\nThose affected by the Curse of the Snake Mother had their health permanently weakened. They also became afflicted by terrifying dreams and visions tuned into the future of the Living Jungle. Additionally, those who bore the Curse of the Snake Mother were perceived to appear almost equal by yuan-ti, as far as was possible for \"lesser creatures\" of non-serpentine nature. This was beneficial when dealing with sentient serpentine beings such as nagas but less so when encountering those who hated and feared the Snake People of Malatra. The telltale sign that an individual was cursed with the affliction was a snake-shaped scar that materialized on their forearms, and their hands became covered in scar tissue.\nOne year after the Year of New Peoples, Malatran calendar, in the late 14 century DR, the Curse of the Snake Mother was bestowed upon the heroes of Malatra as they used the powerful divination artifact known as the Stone of Seeing. All who peered inside with the Snake Mother to witness the coming of the monstrous extraplanar evil of the Tamara became permanently afflicted with the condition."
