        "Effects": "Those affected by the ''Curse of the Snake Mother'' had their health permanently weakened. They also became afflicted by terrifying dreams and visions tuned into the future of the [[Living Jungle]]. Additionally, those who bore the ''Curse of the Snake Mother'' were perceived to appear almost equal by yuan-ti, as far as was possible for \"lesser creatures\" of non-serpentine nature. This was beneficial when dealing with sentient serpentine beings such as [[naga]]s but less so when encountering those who hated and feared the Snake People of [[Malatra]]. The telltale sign that an individual was cursed with the affliction was a [[snake]]-shaped scar that materialized on their forearms, and their hands became covered in scar tissue.",
        "History": "One year after the Year of New Peoples, Malatran calendar, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Curse of the Snake Mother'' was bestowed upon the heroes of Malatra as they used the powerful [[divination]] artifact known as the ''[[Stone of Seeing]]''. All who peered inside with the Snake Mother to witness the coming of the monstrous extraplanar evil of the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]] became permanently afflicted with the condition.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Quest for the Snake Mother|11}}"
