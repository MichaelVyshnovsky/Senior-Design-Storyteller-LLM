'''Grey Fever''' was a fatal disease that often struck travelers who dared to explore the dark recesses of the [[Grey Jungle]] in [[east Zakhara]].

Unless a skilled healer or [[cleric]] was on hand, anyone afflicted with this disease usually died quickly before they could escape the boundaries of the jungle and seek medical attention.

The origins and cause of this disease were unknown.
