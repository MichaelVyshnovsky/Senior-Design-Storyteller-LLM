Moon frenzy, also known as werewolf moon frenzy, was a disease spread by the bite of a natural-born werewolf (i.e., a "true" werewolf). This disease did not transmit the werewolfs lycanthropy, Werewolves themselves were immune to moon frenzy.
The main consequence of this disease was an unpredictable and violent rage, causing an infected individual to attack friends and foes alike. The first sign was a fever that disrupted the sufferers willpower. As the disease progressed over the course of a couple of days, the sufferer would lash out in anger whenever they were injured, first against their own allies, then against anything in arms reach, and finally against anything in sight. If they had nobody on which to vent their rage, they wandered aimlessly as they looked for someone to strike.
While it was possible to shake off the moon frenzy in its earlier stages, this became impossible without magical intervention if the rage progressed too far.
During the late 15 century DR, members of the Gray Wolf tribe of the Uthgardt were known to inflict moon frenzy on their foes. This tactic was notable among their "stormcallers", a type of shaman.
