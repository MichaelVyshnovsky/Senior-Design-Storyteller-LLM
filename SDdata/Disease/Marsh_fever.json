        "mainbody": "Marsh fever, also known as sallar or typhus, was one of the Five Fevers of Faerûn.\nIn Cormyr, the disease was most associated with Marsember, and so was sometimes called Marsembian marsh fever or Marsember Pox.Nowhere is it stated explicitly that \"Marsembian marsh fever\" and \"Marsember Pox\" are the same disease, however both are presented as a deadly disease that looms large in the minds of the Cormyrean elite in Volos Guide to Cormyr and Cormyr A Novel respectively. As these are both works by Ed Greenwood and the diseases fulfil the same role, they are presumed to be the same thing.\nMarsh fever was spread from contagious vermin to mammals by injury, usually via a bite or scratch, and symptoms would begin to manifest within three to eighteen days from the point of exposure.\nIt was possible to become infected with the disease again after recovering from a prior infection.\nMarsh fever caused fever and a steady and fairly fast decline in stamina and fortitude. Marsembian citizens who were believed to be infected with marsh fever displayed pale skin, bouts of coughing, and unexplained spitting. While a healthy individual could recover naturally from the disease, marsh fever could be fatal. About 30% of humans and elves who contracted it were expected to perish, while the rest could be incapacitated for as much as a month.\nIt was said that the disease could be resistant to magical cures, such as spells or potions, resulting in plagues.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it was estimated that 1 in every 50 vermin in Faerûn was infected with marsh fever.\nOtyughs were also said to be highly likely to be carriers of the disease and could spread it via their bites, although they showed none of the symptoms themselves and so were believed to be highly resistant to the disease.\nAs of the mid&ndash14 century DR, most Cormyrean nobility refused to travel to Marsember out of a (not entirely accurate) belief that the city was always gripped by an epidemic of marsh fever, and there were rumors that both the Aurubaen and Janthrin families had died out owing to marsh fever. Regardless of the truth, it was generally the case that \"marsh fever\" was an overused and generally inaccurate term for describing the general conditions in Marsember."
