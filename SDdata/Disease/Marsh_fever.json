        "mainbody": "'''Marsh fever''', also known as '''sallar''' or '''typhus''', was one of the [[Five Fevers]] of [[Faerûn]].\n\nIn [[Cormyr]], the [[disease]] was most associated with [[Marsember]], and so was sometimes called '''Marsembian marsh fever''' or '''Marsember Pox'''.<ref group=\"note\">Nowhere is it stated explicitly that \"Marsembian marsh fever\" and \"Marsember Pox\" are the same disease, however both are presented as a deadly disease that looms large in the minds of the Cormyrean elite in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'' and ''[[Cormyr: A Novel]]'' respectively. As these are both works by [[Ed Greenwood]] and the diseases fulfil the same role, they are presumed to be the same thing.",
        "Acquisition": "Marsh fever was spread from contagious vermin to mammals by injury, usually via a bite or scratch, and symptoms would begin to manifest within three to eighteen days from the point of exposure.{{Cite dragon/40/Believe it or not, Fantasy has reality|54-55}}\n\nIt was possible to become infected with the disease again after recovering from a prior infection.",
        "Effects": "Marsh fever caused fever and a steady and fairly fast decline in stamina and fortitude. Marsembian citizens who were believed to be infected with marsh fever displayed pale skin, bouts of coughing, and unexplained spitting. While a healthy individual could recover naturally from the disease, marsh fever could be fatal. About 30% of [[human]]s and [[elves]] who contracted it were expected to perish, while the rest could be incapacitated for as much as a month.",
        "Treatment": "It was said that the disease could be resistant to magical cures, such as [[spells]] or [[potion]]s, resulting in plagues.",
        "Notable Carriers": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was estimated that 1 in every 50 vermin in Faerûn was infected with marsh fever.\n\n[[Otyugh]]s were also said to be highly likely to be carriers of the disease and could spread it via their bites,{{Cite dragon/96/The Ecology of the Gulguthra|22}} although they showed none of the symptoms themselves and so were believed to be highly resistant to the disease.",
        "History": "As of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, most [[Nobility of Cormyr|Cormyrean nobility]] refused to travel to Marsember out of a (not entirely accurate) belief that the city was always gripped by an epidemic of marsh fever, and there were rumors that both the [[Aurubaen]] and [[Janthrin]] families had died out owing to marsh fever. Regardless of the truth, it was generally the case that \"marsh fever\" was an overused and generally inaccurate term for describing the general conditions in Marsember."
