'''Foamjaws''', also known as '''rabies''' and as '''darrdartha''' in [[Elven language|Elven]], was a type of natural [[disease]] that could be found in the Realms.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Foamjaws and its Cures}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Spirit|13}}

==Acquisition==
This disease was carried by both [[humanoid]]s and various [[animal]]s who could spread it to others by biting them. It was not widespread among either group, as nine in ten creatures were immune to it. However, those immune to foamjaws still acted as carriers and could still spread it with their bites.

Those who had survived the disease could acquire it again.

==Symptoms==
The disease was fatal unless treated and cured. Symptoms generally manifested within 10 days of exposure, and an infected individual was usually dead within another 10 days.{{Cite dragon/280/Polymorphology|40}} 

This disease ravaged the minds of those affected. The onset of foamjaws was characterized by a "red fog" settling over the mind and affecting the edges of sight. Infected individuals became irritable and quick to anger, with anything from a loud noise to being awoken at night potentially sending them into a blind rage that would not abate unless they were knocked unconscious or killed. Furthermore, the disease rendered them unwilling to eat or drink anything.

==Treatment==
In addition to [[magic]]al means of curing disease, such as the ''[[cure disease]]'' [[spell]], there were a variety of [[herb]]s that could be eaten to cure foamjaws. The two most effective were [[foambane]] and [[quarrada]]. Others included the cave [[mushroom]] [[fire eyes (fungi)|fire eyes]] and a drinkable quaff made from boiling [[amthannas]]. Because an infected individual refused to eat or drink, any herbal remedy had to be forcibly fed to them.

==History==
Due to nine in ten creatures being immune to foamjaws but still acting as carriers, over time [[goblin]]s and [[orc]]s gained a folkloric reputation among [[human]]s for having bites that "carry [[poison]]".

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], many of the animals that inhabited the [[Vast Swamp]] were carriers of rabies. [[Giant bat]]s were particularly notable carries, including those found within the city of [[Kuo Meilan]]'s subterranean zoo, those living within caverns on the side of [[Mount Hotenow]],<ref>{{Cite dungeon/28/Visitors from Above|67}} and those that dwelt in the mountains of [[The Vast]].

[[Jarbo]]s were known to become infected with a "foaming sickness" akin to rabies, but their bites did not necessarily cause rabies in humanoids.
