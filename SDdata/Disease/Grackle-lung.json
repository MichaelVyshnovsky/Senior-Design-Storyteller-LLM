        "mainbody": "'''Grackle-lung''' was a respiratory [[disease]] unique to the city of [[Gracklstugh]] in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Acquisition": "Grackle-lung arose as a consequence of breathing in the fumes and gasses emitted from the [[forge]]s of the subterranean cavern of Gracklstugh, which was not adequately ventilated to prevent this smog from accumulating in the city. Any air-breathing creature that spent at least a day in Gracklstugh ran the risk of contracting grackle-lung, although the city's longtime residents&mdash;notably its [[duergar]] and [[derro]] inhabitants&mdash;had become accustomed to the smog and were less likely to get sick from it.",
        "Effects": "The chief symptom of grackle-lung was a persistent, wracking cough as the sufferer's airways became clogged with black phlegm, and each passing day in Gracklstugh brought the risk of the condition worsening. The associated difficulty of breathing made it hard to engage in strenuous physical activity, such as running, and caused a steady decline in energy and endurance as the disease took its toll. The coughing could also interrupt spellcasters' attempts to speak the [[verbal component]]s of their [[spell]]s, which became more and more difficult to utter as the disease progressed. In worst cases, grackle-lung could eventually turn fatal in as little as six days if the sufferer's airways became completely clogged.",
        "Treatment": "The condition could usually be recovered from naturally, or it could be immediately cleared with the casting of ''[[cure disease]]'' or similar [[magic]]. The city's persistent smog remained a hazard, however, and those who recovered from the disease risked showing signs again within a [[tenday]].",
        "History": "Grackle-lung posed a notable risk to any visitors to Gracklstugh during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
