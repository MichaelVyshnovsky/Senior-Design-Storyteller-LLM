'''Gangrene''', or '''darkrot''', was the death of body tissues caused by prolonged lack of blood flow, characterized by putrification, foul smell, and blackened color.

{{quote|''Many [[warrior]]s fear gangrene more than the [[sword]]. When "the rots" sets in, the only recourse at times lay in drastic measures.''|From the pages of ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.}}

==Acquisition==
Gangrene was considered one of the most dangerous natural diseases as it could be contracted via a simple piercing or slashing wound if left untreated. Gangrene could set in a short period of time as 24 hours. [[Frostbite (condition)|Frostbite]] was just as dangerous. Frozen tissue stopped blood flow which eventually led to gangrene.

Some dangerous [[undead]] creatures like [[angel of decay|angels of decay]] and [[plague blight]]s could spread gangrene with a mere touch. Some living creatures, such as [[shadowdrake]]s were known to inflict darkrot.

Some rare and unlucky individuals who wronged the [[Vistani]] folk of [[Barovia]] were sentenced to death by some of the most horrific way. One such death was inflicted upon a criminal via a full-body gangrene.<ref>{{Cite book| author = David Wise| title = Van Richten's Monster Hunter's Compendium Vol.III| short_story = | date = | editor = Jonatha Ariadne Caspin| publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = 0-7869-1613-3| pages = 163| chapter = }}

Darkrot was a common danger in the [[Rat Hills]] outside the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]].

==Effects==
Once gangrene set in, afflicted flesh sprouted blackened patches within one or two days after infection. Within two to twelve days, the breathing of the afflicted became labored and hissing. As the infection spread, their bodies weakened until they reached the full-system shock as early as seven days after infection. If left untreated, death was inevitable.

==Treatment==
The spell of ''[[Talona's blessing]]'' could ward off gangrene or stop its spread. The spell required the [[cleric]] to touch the afflicted body part.

[[Comfrey root]] was a healing [[herb]] that possessed some curative properties that could stave the spread of gangrene. Herbal treatments for gangrene required thrice daily ingestion of dangerously potent herbs as well as frequent observation by a healer.{{Cite dragon/269/Herbcraft|39}}

[[File:Amputation saw.png|thumb|''A set of [[amputation saw]]s – a sure cure for the dreaded darkrot.'']]Once the rot set in, the only non-magical cure was amputation, with death being the only alternative. When performed in a controlled environment, amputation was performed using [[amputation saw]]s. Each limb or appendage requited a separate tool, all professionally forged in [[Procampur]] and purchasable from the ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. Separate saws were used to remove fingers, arms, legs, and trunk sections; a special joint cutter was required in some cases, while snips were required to amputate for fleshy sections. The surgery required [[tourniquet]]s and [[gauze]] as it produced a lot of blood. Healers recommended the subjects of the surgeries to be very drunk to dull the pain.

A holy spring of [[Eldath]] – [[Sweetwater]], that flowed among the rocks in the forest not far east of The [[Standing Stone]], was known to wash away and neutralize all known [[poison]]s and diseases, including such afflictions as [[mummy rot]] and darkrot.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190916000019/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_070809-05.htm| accessdate = 26-12-2021| date = 26-12-2021}}

===Notable Individuals Who Survived Darkrot===
* [[Athan]], who was entrusted with the ''[[Gauntlets of Moander]]'' by [[Elminster]] was tortured by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and his wounds turned to rot. He was rescued by the [[Veiled Ones]] and, eventually, had his grave wounds healed via [[Mystra]] healing blessings.
* [[Halana Shauluth]], the proprietor of aptly-named [[Halana Shauluth's]] bakery in [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]]. She lost her hand to gangrene, which ended her adventuring career and led her to open the popular and successful bakery business.
* [[Yousouf]], of [[Yousouf's Grocery]] a retired adventurer whose friend and healer [[Ihre]] was forced to amputate his gangrenous toes following nasty frostbite.
