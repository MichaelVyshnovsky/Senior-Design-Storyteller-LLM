==Acquisition==

Nevertheless, this information is included for faithfulness to the source text and setting. that being chilly led to catching the common cold.{{Cite polyhedron/28/The Great Bugbear Hunt|12}} or to travel during cold or rainy weather.{{Cite dragon/15/Weather in the Wilderness|14-15}}

==Effects==
Sufferers of the common cold experienced fits of coughing and sneezing,{{Cite dungeon/217/Rats in the Undercellar|7}} which could disrupt the casting of [[spell]]s or the conducting of [[ritual]]s.{{Cite dragon/210/Dead or Alive? The economic, legal, and political aspects of resurrection magic|13}} Colds varied from mild to severe, although even severe infections were seen as merely annoying and uncomfortable compared to other, more fatal diseases.{{Cite dragon/167/Curses are Divine|31}}

==Treatment==
The common cold was easy to cure with [[magical]] healing<ref name=CotAB-p12"> however it was generally seen as too trivial to warrant the use of spells, thus some [[priest]]s saw it as beneath the scope of their healing duties. However, the [[Temple of Gond (Tilverton)|Temple of Gond]] in [[Tilverton]] was said to treat the common cold in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=CotAB-p12" />

The common cold could also be treated effectively by mundane means. Remedies for the common cold were offered at [[apothecary]] shops (such as [[Mother's Cupboard]] in [[Raven's Bluff]]), where they sold for 1 [[gp]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dragon/269/Extra Healing|46}} and [[horsetail]], as well as [[mallow]], [[catnip]], [[chives]], [[garlic]], [[ginger]], [[mustard (plant)|mustard]], and [[rose]].

The [[halfling]]s of [[Luiren]] had learned a special skill of medicinal cooking that involved making curative foods using [[Luiren spring cheese]], and apprentice cooks knew how to prepare meals that could cure many normal diseases, including the common cold.

==History==
The small settlement of [[Kin Elbhaz]] in [[Maztica]] was famous as a place of such good fortune that the common cold was the worst disease with which they had to contend.

==Notable Carriers==
* [[Coll]], a young [[thief]] who tried to flee [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, who caught a cold while hanging out around the docks without any shoes.
