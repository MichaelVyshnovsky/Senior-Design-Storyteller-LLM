'''Measles''' was a mundane infectious [[disease]].

==Treatment==
[[Saffron]] was said to be useful in treating measles.

In the [[Shining South]]'s [[hin]] nation of [[Luiren]], the halflings had learned a special skill of medicinal cooking that involved making curative foods using [[Luiren spring cheese]]. Apprentice cooks knew how to prepare meals that could cure many normal diseases, including measles.
