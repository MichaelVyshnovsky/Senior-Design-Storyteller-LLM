        "mainbody": "evil chills was a supernatural disease spread by certain types of devils.\nMany types of devils could be carriers for the disease&mdashincluding barbazu, erinyes, and pit fiends&mdashand such carriers did not experience any symptoms despite being contagious. The disease was spread via the bites and septic claws of infected devils, as well as by the filthy beards of the barbazu. The disease could also be contracted upon exposure to a devils blood, and so some devils were known to smear their infected blood onto their favored weapons before battle.\nSufferers of devil chills experienced a steady wasting away of their physical strength.\nWhile a healthy individual could recover naturally from devil chills, the disease was stubborn and required a longer recovery period than most other illnesses.\nDevil chills was one of many diseases that could be found in the Underdark.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, three erinyes infected with devil chills&mdashAlecto, Tisiphone, and Magaera&mdashwere charged with guarding a portal in the Fields of Nun that lay along the Trail of Tears, a pilgrimage route for the devout of Tempus. These guardians&mdashalongside their likewise infected barbazu minions&mdashwere tasked with imparting the lesson that war is but one way that people die, with disease being a clear and obvious alternative.\nThe archdevil Bel was said to be infected with devil chills."
