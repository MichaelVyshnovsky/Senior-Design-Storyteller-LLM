        "Acquisition": "The disease was highly was infectious, and could devastate a realm as it seemed to travel through at a rate of over {{SI|2|miles|k|long=yes}} per day. It was possible to become infected with the disease again after recovering from a prior infection.{{Cite dragon/40/Believe it or not, Fantasy has reality|54-55}}",
        "Effects": "Symptoms of bubonic plague included buboes&mdash;swollen lymph nodes on the neck, armpits, and groin that could grow to the size of [[apple]]s&mdash;and internal bleeding that caused black and red bruising all over the body.{{Cite dragon/138/The End of the World: Of plagues, player characters, and campaign worlds|44}} The disease led to a steady decline in vitality, physical strength, constitution, and reflexes, with the sufferer getting noticeably worse every six hours or so. There was only a 1 in 3 chance of survival without treatment, and death usually came within 3 to 6 days of the onset of symptoms.{{Cite dragon/138/The End of the World: Of plagues, player characters, and campaign worlds|47}} Those who survived were typically bedridden for a [[tenday]] and a half, and remained frail for ten to sixty days after that.\n\n[[Human]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[elves]] were all equally susceptible to the plague, while [[halfling]]s were about 40% less likely to die of an infection.",
        "Treatment": "It was said that the plague was resistant to [[magic]]al cures, such as [[spell]]s or [[potion]]s.",
        "History": "The bubonic plague was known as the \"black plague\" on the [[Whamite Isles]], where it was a threat to the people who lived there,\n\nThe [[halfling]]s of [[Luiren]] had learned a special skill of medicinal cooking that involved making curative foods using [[Luiren spring cheese]], and experienced cooks knew how to prepare meals that could cure many otherwise fatal normal diseases, including bubonic plague."
