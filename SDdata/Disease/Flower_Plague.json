        "mainbody": "The '''Flower Plague''' was a [[disease]] outbreak that spread across [[Calimshan]] in the {{YearlinkName|-52}}.",
        "Acquisition": "The disease was caused by exposure to the spores that exploded out from the seed pods of a rare scarlet flower.",
        "Effects": "Initial symptoms included rashes and vomiting. As the disease advanced, the sufferer developed a fever. Ultimately, the disease could be fatal.",
        "History": "The outbreak of the Flower Plague was caused by demand for the newly discovered, exotic red flowers that caused the illness. This allowed the disease to spread via trade for the plants, primarily afflicting [[Almraiven]], [[Calimport]], and [[Keltar]].\n\nBy the end of the outbreak, 7% of people in Calimport had died from the disease relative to only 2% across the rest of Calimshan."
