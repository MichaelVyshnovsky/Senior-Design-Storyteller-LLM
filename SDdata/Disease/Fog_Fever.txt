The Fog Fever was a disease outbreak that struck the Shoon Imperium in the .
The plague was contracted through the breathing in of a clinging fog that spread at night.
Afflicted individuals suffered from delusions and a raging, potentially fatal fever. If someone died of this fever, their last breath expelled more of the fog that spread the disease.
The Fog Fever spread to every city in the Shoon Imperium across both Calimshan and Tethyr, and killed as much as 11% of the population. It struck major cities especially hard, notably Calimport (where the death toll reached 31%), Memnon, and Myratma.
