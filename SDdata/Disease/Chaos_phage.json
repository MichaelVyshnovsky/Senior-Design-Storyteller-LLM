        "mainbody": "'''Chaos phage''', (also known as '''slaad fever''',) was a magical disease most commonly inflicted by [[blue slaad]]i, a race of creatures originating from the [[plane]] of [[Limbo]].\n\nThe disease was slow acting but incredibly fatal, and usually killed its host within days, causing them to rapidly wither away. People killed by the disease would be reborn as [[red slaad]]i. Arcane spellcasters capable of casting more than basic [[spell]]s would instead be reborn as [[green slaad]]i.\n\nThe disease could only be cured by magical means, casting the spells [[Remove disease|''remove disease'']] or [[Greater restoration|''greater restoration'']], and the transformation could only be undone by a ''[[wish]]'' spell."
