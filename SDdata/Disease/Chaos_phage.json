        "mainbody": "Chaos phage, (also known as slaad fever,) was a magical disease most commonly inflicted by blue slaadi, a race of creatures originating from the plane of Limbo.\nThe disease was slow acting but incredibly fatal, and usually killed its host within days, causing them to rapidly wither away. People killed by the disease would be reborn as red slaadi. Arcane spellcasters capable of casting more than basic spells would instead be reborn as green slaadi.\nThe disease could only be cured by magical means, casting the spells remove disease or greater restoration, and the transformation could only be undone by a wish spell."
