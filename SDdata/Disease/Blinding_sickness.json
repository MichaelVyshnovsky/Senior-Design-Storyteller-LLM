        "mainbody": "linding sickness, also known as river blindness, was a disease that could cause permanent loss of vision and even death.\nBlinding sickness was generally contracted by drinking water contaminated with the disease It was further known to be transmissible if tainted water came into contact with a creatures unprotected eyes, nose, or ears. Creatures who dwelt in the waters and sewers in which the disease was pervasive tended to be immune to it.\nThe disease could also be acquired by inhaling the spores of a variety of white toadstool mushrooms that could be found in Undermountain.\nBlinding sickness was one of several diseases that could be inflicted using the contagion spell.\nSymptoms usually began to set in after one to three days. The initial effect was a steady deterioration of the infected individuals strength, followed by loss of vision. The progression of the disease could also include a loss of stamina as well as blurry vision&mdashwhich made it hard to see more than about &mdashbefore advancement to total blindness. This blindness lasted until the disease was cured, but could even be permanent. Afflicted creatures eyes turned a milky white and they felt pain in their heads, which interfered with their willpower.\nThe steady deterioration of the infected individuals strength and stamina was a bigger danger than the blindness as it could ultimately cause weakness to the point of death.\nA healthy immune system could fight off the disease in as little as two days, although any vision loss that occurred would remain. Only restorative magics, such as lesser restoration, could undo this damage.\nThe \"red tides\" of the Elemental Plane of Water carried blinding sickness.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, stagnant waters contaminated with blinding sickness could be found in places like Dead Orc Pass in the North, the Underdark, and Zakhara. and especially in the sewers of Waterdeep."
