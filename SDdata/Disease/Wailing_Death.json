        "mainbody": "The '''Wailing Death''' was a [[magical]] [[disease]] that ravaged the city of [[Neverwinter]] in [[Tarsakh]] and [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. Most of the citizens of the city were dead or dying within a [[tenday]] of the first reported case. Neverwinter did not fully recover from the effects of the disease for an entire decade, and it left the city vulnerable to [[Netherese]] infiltration.",
        "History": "The disease started in a region of the city known as the [[Beggar's Nest]], one of the poorer districts. Clerics and healers were dumbfounded at the disease's resilience to both mundane and magical healing and hundreds were dead within days. The city was quickly quarantined to prevent the spread of the disease. Furthermore, a call was put out for brave persons to receive free training at the [[Neverwinter Academy]] in order to create a task force of [[adventurer]]s who could combat the plague any way they could; they expected to be loyal to the city, or at least to gold. At the same time, Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] petitioned [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] to come up with an [[arcane]] cure. Nasher's right hand, Lady [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]], spearheaded these efforts with the aid of her fianc√©e, [[Fenthick Moss]], and [[Desther Indelayne]], the leader of an expedition of [[Helm]]ite priests from [[Helm's Hold]], who were the last people to enter the city before the quarantine.\n\nAs the first and best of the newly trained adventurers gathered for a graduation ceremony, several strange [[mage]]s teleported in with a small army of [[goblin]]s and [[undead]]. Their intention was to steal away the reagents Khelben had sent to the city as the essential parts of the disease's cure. These reagents were the brain of an [[intellect devourer]], the heart of a [[yuan-ti pureblood]], a [[cockatrice]] feather, and a lock of a [[dryad]]'s hair. The plans of the mages were foiled but the reagent creatures all fled into the city at large. The cure was gone and the city's hopes with it. Many among the student body and faculty were slain in the attack. Among the survivors was the adventurer who would be known as the [[Hero of Neverwinter]].\n\nDue to mass riots, the remaining city militia was charged with peacekeeping and the task of finding the reagent creatures fell to that adventurer and allies. They were successful and soon the cure was back in the hands of city leaders, while several clues had turned up about a [[Cult of the Eye]] that might have been behind the attack on the academy.\n\nDuring the ritual to create the cure, however, a further setback occurred. Desther revealed himself and his priests to be agents of the Cult of the Eye and they stole the cure and fled through a portal back to Helm's Hold. The [[Hero of Neverwinter]] and allies followed them and retrieved the cure.\n\nThe plague wasn't completely over, however. Afterward, the Hero of Neverwinter discovered that Commander [[Damas]] of [[Fort Ilkard]] had used blankets contaminated with the Wailing Death to infect the [[Elk tribe]].\n\nEventually, the plague was completely cured, but it had done its damage, weakened Neverwinter to such an extent that [[Luskan]] declared war on the city and invaded. Only with the help of the [[Lords' Alliance]] and the Hero of Neverwinter did the city repel the Luskan army."
