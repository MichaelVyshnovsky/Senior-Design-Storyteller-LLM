        "mainbody": "ll-consuming wasting was a magical disease that transformed the afflicted into an all-consuming hunger.\nThe disease was primarily inflicted when an all-consuming hunger swarmed a victim, If the infection took root, symptoms began to manifest in about one day.\nAll-consuming wasting was said to be similar to mummy rot. It could take several days for the disease to kill an infected individual, at which point their rotten body parts would animate as a new all-consuming hunger less than half a minute later.\nWhile a strong immune system&mdashand a great deal of luck&mdashcould stave off the progression of the disease, only magical healing, such as remove disease, could allow an infected individual to recover from all-consuming wasting.\nSometime prior to the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Keeper of Thaal devised a means to create unique undead abominations that could spread all-consuming wasting. The only known success was achieved using the corpse of a bard named Askilion."
