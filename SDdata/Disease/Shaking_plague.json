        "mainbody": "The Shaking Plague was a disease that was known as one of the Three Plagues of Faerûn. The disease was not well understood but was well known in southern and eastern lands, however as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it was most famous for ravaging the city of Scardale Town in Scardale during the .\nShaking Plague was not the same thing as shaking fever.\nAlthough the definitive cause of the disease was unknown, and many had their suspicions,\nThe disease was spread though physical contact with the infected, who most contagious during the first tenday after their symptoms appeared.\nVictims of the plague exhibited tremors and convulsions, lowered body temperature, sweating, pale skin, pox, and lack of speech in fairly rapid succession. It was often deadly.\nThe earliest observable symptom of the Shaking Plague was to cause the victim to go very pale and to sweat so profusely that they required a great deal of water. After about a day, the sweating subsided that after which the primary symptom was the one for which the plague was named uncontrollable and constant shaking of the limbs.\nOver the course of the first tenday, black, pus-filled boils would appear around the face, underarms, and groin. These would grow in size, turn yellow and eventually burst, releasing a golden discharge that was contagious to the touch. The pain was so intense that it could cause a near-constant whimpering in those afflicted.\nAs the disease progressed, it led to painful twisting and writhing of the body, and these spasms could prove fatal if they became so violent that they caused victims to choke on their own bodily fluids, experience heart seizures, or stop their lungs from functioning. \nImmersing the body in water appeared to alleviate some of the pain of the symptoms. \nThe most reliable known cure for the Shaking Plague was a particularly expensive combination of divine and arcane spells. The simultaneous casting of dispel magic and cure disease upon the victim would instantaneously purge any trace of the disease from their body. Due to the cost of these spells, many could only dream of being cured after infection. \nThe disease had a reputation in southern and eastern lands as a fatal affliction that broke out only rarely.\nIn the , an outbreak of the Shaking Plague in Calimshan killed nearly 1 in 5 people across the realm, striking Calimport, Memnon, and Teshburl. Calimport was hit especially hard, with 31% of the population succumbing to the sickness.\nThe Shaking Plague reduced Scardale Towns population from over 10,000 in 1370 DR to only 4,440 just two years later. This came to be known as the citys \"doom\", and was considered the first known outbreak of the disease in Faerûn proper."
