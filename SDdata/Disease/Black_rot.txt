Black rot was a disease that consumed the infecteds brain but left their bodies completely intact.
The disease was said to have similarities to vampirism. It caused insomnia and fatigue followed by high fever, sweating, delusions, and ultimately death.
In 1372 DR, the necromancer Daxiong who was working on improvements to the process of zombification, followed a case of strange plague to the hamlet of Gillians Hill. There he was experimenting on recently perished farmers. During that period of time, there were also rumors of a black rot outbreak in the farmlands further south.
