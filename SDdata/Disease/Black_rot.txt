'''Black rot''' was a [[disease]] that consumed the infected's brain but left their bodies completely intact.

==Effects==
The disease was said to have similarities to [[vampirism]]. It caused insomnia and fatigue followed by high fever, sweating, delusions, and ultimately death.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the [[necromancer]] [[Daxiong]] who was working on improvements to the process of zombification, followed a case of strange plague to the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]]. There he was experimenting on recently perished farmers. During that period of time, there were also rumors of a black rot outbreak in the farmlands further south.
