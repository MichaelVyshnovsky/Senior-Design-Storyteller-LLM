        "mainbody": "'''Whitewasting''', also known as '''leprosy''' and the '''wasting disease''', was a well-known [[disease]] in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Acquisition": "Whitewasting was transmissible through contact with someone suffering from the disease, although an exposed individual might not begin showing symptoms for 5 years. \n\nThe disease could also be inflicted by a casting of the spell ''[[Scourge (spell)|scourge]]'' or by the touch of a [[spawn of Kyuss]] and certain [[undead]]. Some powerful [[necromancer]]s also gained the \"gift\" of being able to bestow the disease with a mere touch of their scabrous hands. A more aggressive form of whitewasting was bestowed by the ''[[periapt of foul rotting]]''.",
        "Effects": "Whitewasting was a disease that appeared to rot the sufferer's body, and/or skin. It led to a numbing or cessation of the senses, notably the sense of pain.\n\nSufferers of whitewasting experienced a steady and rapid loss of their mobility and reflexes and a slow, month-to-month decline in their strength, stamina, and physical appearance.",
        "Treatment": "With luck, a healthy individual might be able to fight off whitewasting naturally, but the disease was generally considered incurable by the standards of non-[[magical]] illnesses.\n\nProgression of the disease could be slowed by casting ''[[Talona's blessing]]'', and it could be cured by casting ''[[cure disease]]'' or reversed using ''[[cell adjustment]]'', even in its more advanced stages.",
        "History": "Sometime after the {{YearlinkName|309}}, [[Halaster Blackcloak]] faked his own death (for the first time) by creating a [[Clone (spell)|clone]], infecting it with leprosy, and leaving it to die where patrols from [[Waterdeep]] would discover it.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|354}}, a plague resembling a highly virulent or magical form of leprosy struck the [[Shoon Imperium]], and came to be known as the \"[[Leper's Curse]]\".\n\nAs a general rule, almost any rural temple was willing to provide basic food and water to those suffering from whitewasting and other similar misfortunes. During this time, sanctioned leper houses and asylums could be found at the [[Hall of the Arch]] in [[Suldolphor]], [[Churthryn Hall]] near [[Ravens Bluff]],{{Cite polyhedron/147/Pillars of Ravens Bluff|23}} and [[St. Wityn's Hospice]], an abbey of [[Ilmater]] in the [[Alimir Mountains]].\n\nFollowing the razing of [[Zhentil Keep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, whitewasting became a notable issue in the city.\n\nThroughout the 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Inn of the Dripping Dagger]] in Waterdeep became known as a place that welcomed anyone, including those suffering from whitewasting.{{Cite dragon/410/Eye on the Realms: The Talking Door|27}}\n\nOutside of the [[Material Plane]], wealthy individuals in [[Sigil]] were known to place [[curse]]s on their valuables which could inflict leprosy on thieves, and the disease could be encountered in [[Thanatos (layer)|Thanatos]], the realm of [[Orcus]] in the [[Abyss]]."
