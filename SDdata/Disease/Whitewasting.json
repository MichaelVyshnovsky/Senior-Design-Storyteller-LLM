        "mainbody": "Whitewasting, also known as leprosy and the wasting disease, was a well-known disease in Faer√ªn.\nWhitewasting was transmissible through contact with someone suffering from the disease, although an exposed individual might not begin showing symptoms for 5 years. \nThe disease could also be inflicted by a casting of the spell scourge or by the touch of a spawn of Kyuss and certain undead. Some powerful necromancers also gained the \"gift\" of being able to bestow the disease with a mere touch of their scabrous hands. A more aggressive form of whitewasting was bestowed by the periapt of foul rotting.\nWhitewasting was a disease that appeared to rot the sufferers body, and/or skin. It led to a numbing or cessation of the senses, notably the sense of pain.\nSufferers of whitewasting experienced a steady and rapid loss of their mobility and reflexes and a slow, month-to-month decline in their strength, stamina, and physical appearance.\nWith luck, a healthy individual might be able to fight off whitewasting naturally, but the disease was generally considered incurable by the standards of non-magical illnesses.\nProgression of the disease could be slowed by casting Talonas blessing, and it could be cured by casting cure disease or reversed using cell adjustment, even in its more advanced stages.\nSometime after the , Halaster Blackcloak faked his own death (for the first time) by creating a clone, infecting it with leprosy, and leaving it to die where patrols from Waterdeep would discover it.\nIn the , a plague resembling a highly virulent or magical form of leprosy struck the Shoon Imperium, and came to be known as the \"Lepers Curse\".\nAs a general rule, almost any rural temple was willing to provide basic food and water to those suffering from whitewasting and other similar misfortunes. During this time, sanctioned leper houses and asylums could be found at the Hall of the Arch in Suldolphor, Churthryn Hall near Ravens Bluff, and St. Wityns Hospice, an abbey of Ilmater in the Alimir Mountains.\nFollowing the razing of Zhentil Keep in the , whitewasting became a notable issue in the city.\nThroughout the 15 century DR, the Inn of the Dripping Dagger in Waterdeep became known as a place that welcomed anyone, including those suffering from whitewasting.\nOutside of the Material Plane, wealthy individuals in Sigil were known to place curses on their valuables which could inflict leprosy on thieves, and the disease could be encountered in Thanatos, the realm of Orcus in the Abyss."
