        "mainbody": "An '''arcane blight''' was a [[magical]] [[disease]] that transformed the sufferer into a [[nothic]].",
        "Acquisition": "Any [[humanoid]] exposed to an area radiating an arcane blight ran the risk of contracting it within twelve hours. If they did so, the first obvious signs were feelings of isolation and experiencing paranoid delusions that left the victim unable to trust anyone around them. As the disease progressed, the victim would transform into a nothic over the course of three days if they were unable to shake the blight. This entailed symptoms of clammy skin, hair loss, and near-sightedness before the transformation culminated on the final day.",
        "Treatment": "The best way to avoid the disease was to prevent prolonged exposure to it. Once an individual became infected and their three day countdown began, their chances of fighting off the disease actually increased day-by-day until it became too late. During this period, curative magic on the level of ''[[greater restoration]]'' could remove the disease as well as its physical and psychological symptoms, however, once the full transformation into a nothic had occurred, only [[god|divine intervention]] or the ''[[wish]]'' spell could reverse it.\n\nThose who beat the disease naturally found themselves immune to it, although this was not the case for those who were magically cured.",
        "History": "When the floating [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Ythryn]] crashed into the [[Reghed Glacier]] in the {{YearlinkName|-343}}, the ruined city radiated an arcane blight that soon turned the surviving [[mage]]s into nothics. Even centuries later, as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], visitors to the crash site risked succumbing to the blight as well if they lingered for too long."
