'''Scurvy''', otherwise known as '''blackjaws''', '''sea fever''', or '''toothfall''',{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/Scurvy in the Realms}} was a naturally occurring form of [[disease]]. It was what some classified as a deficiency

==Effects==
Those afflicted with this disease would experience a blackening of their gums and teeth falling out.

==Carriers==
Scurvy was common among sailors, though it only occurred rarely with [[Faer√ªn]]ian sailors as most sailing was done not that far from coasts. Scurvy was also known to occur with [[adventurer]]s who tried to subsist on only [[ration]]s.

==Treatment==
The best method for preventing or treating scurvy was to eat certain fruits, in particular citrus fruits,<ref> though [[onion]]s could also help. 

Some sailors were proactive in preventing scurvy by keeping [[lime]]s on their ships, stored within chests of [[sand]], while others carried kegs of (usually fermented) fruit juices. [[Salbread]] was another popular choice among sailors, due to having [[lemon]] and [[orange]] peels baked into the [[bread]].

==Trivia==
The [[cleric]]s of [[Valkur]] uniquely had the [[spell]] ''[[cure scurvy]]'', though they could also reverse the spell's effects to inflict scurvy upon a target.
