        "mainbody": "'''Moon frenzy''', also known as '''werewolf moon frenzy''', was a [[disease]] spread by the bite of a natural-born [[werewolf]] (i.e., a \"[[Lycanthrope#Therianthropes|true]]\" werewolf). This disease did not transmit the werewolf's [[lycanthropy]], Werewolves themselves were immune to moon frenzy.",
        "Effects": "The main consequence of this disease was an unpredictable and violent rage, causing an infected individual to attack friends and foes alike. The first sign was a fever that disrupted the sufferer's willpower. As the disease progressed over the course of a couple of days, the sufferer would lash out in anger whenever they were injured, first against their own allies, then against anything in arm's reach, and finally against anything in sight. If they had nobody on which to vent their rage, they wandered aimlessly as they looked for someone to strike.\n\nWhile it was possible to shake off the moon frenzy in its earlier stages, this became impossible without [[magic]]al intervention if the rage progressed too far.",
        "History": "During the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], members of the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] of the [[Uthgardt]] were known to inflict moon frenzy on their foes. This tactic was notable among their \"[[stormcaller]]s\", a type of [[Uthgardt Beast Cult Shaman|shaman]]."
