        "mainbody": "alonas grimace was a lung disease that slowly drained the health of the infected being.\nOne could only catch this disease from being caught within the Talonite spell, cloud of pestilence, for a prolonged period.\nOnce contracted, the movement of the diseased creature was slightly reduced. Their facial muscles would sometimes tremble and twitch, giving rise to a grimace, hence the name of the condition. From day to day, the infected being would lose health until they died.\nTalonas grimace could be cured by magical or natural means (via herbal medicine)."
