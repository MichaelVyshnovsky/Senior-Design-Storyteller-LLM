        "mainbody": "Scurvy, otherwise known as blackjaws, sea fever, or toothfall, was a naturally occurring form of disease. It was what some classified as a deficiency\nThose afflicted with this disease would experience a blackening of their gums and teeth falling out.\nScurvy was common among sailors, though it only occurred rarely with Faer√ªnian sailors as most sailing was done not that far from coasts. Scurvy was also known to occur with adventurers who tried to subsist on only rations.\nThe best method for preventing or treating scurvy was to eat certain fruits, in particular citrus fruits, though onions could also help. \nSome sailors were proactive in preventing scurvy by keeping limes on their ships, stored within chests of sand, while others carried kegs of (usually fermented) fruit juices. Salbread was another popular choice among sailors, due to having lemon and orange peels baked into the bread.\nThe clerics of Valkur uniquely had the spell cure scurvy, though they could also reverse the spells effects to inflict scurvy upon a target."
