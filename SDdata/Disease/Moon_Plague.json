Through the 14 century DR, it remained unknown what had drawn these lycanthropes to the city.\nThe Moon Plague lasted through the months of Tarsakh and Mirtul of 701 DR. Following the full moon in Mirtul, many of the lycanthropes depart the city for the Shaar and Tashalar apparently to continue spreading their affliction. Several lycanthropes remain in Calimport Muzad beneath the citys streets."
