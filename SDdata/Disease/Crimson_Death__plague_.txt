==Effects==
Individuals afflicted with the Crimson Death bled to death before transforming into a [[crimson death]], which then sought victims of its own to replace the blood it had lost.

==History==
The plague struck the regions around [[Almraiven]], [[Ankhapur]], [[Mintar]], [[Saelmur]], and [[Suldolphor]]. While each of these cities suffered casualties of about 16%, the death toll across the broader area approached 41%.
