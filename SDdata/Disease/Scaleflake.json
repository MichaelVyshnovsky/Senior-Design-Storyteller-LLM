        "mainbody": "caleflake was a disease found only in the Underdark.\nScaleflake was contracted by coming into contact with water tainted with the disease, such as by swimming or wading. Any creature that entered such water could become infected, but the disease was most common among aquatic or reptilian creatures who lived in water.\nScaleflake caused oozing and smelly pustules to swell up all across the sufferers skin, scales, and/or other bodily surfaces. This disgusting affliction steadily deteriorated their physical appearance, leading them to increasingly socially disadvantaged. Sufficiently advanced scaleflake could render the sufferer catatonic.\nWith luck, a healthy individual could recover from scaleflake in a matter of days."
