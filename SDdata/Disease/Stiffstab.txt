'''Stiffstab''', also known as '''jointstabs''' or on other worlds as '''arthritis''', was a naturally occurring [[disease]] that affected the joints.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Sardolphyn Gambit}}{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/These THIEVES Will Have You Rerolling a Rogue}}

==Acquisition==
The disease was observed in all manner of [[humanoid]]s, including [[human]]s,{{Cite dragon/245/Wyrms of the North: Lhammaruntosz|53}} [[elves]], It was suggested that [[green hag]]s might be able to develop it as well.

Arthritis could be inflicted as a [[curse]], such as by a casting of ''[[bestow curse]]''.

==Effects==
Stiffstab caused pain in the joints, which could inhibit certain activities that required dexterous movement such as [[spell]]casting. Sufferers of arthritis found that the [[somatic component]]s of spellcasting could be sufficiently difficulty that they could only be performed correctly in 3 out of every 4 attempts, and in serious cases, the movements for even moderately complex spells became completely impossible.

In serious cases, arthritis could cause the sufferer's hands to shrivel into claw-like positions.
