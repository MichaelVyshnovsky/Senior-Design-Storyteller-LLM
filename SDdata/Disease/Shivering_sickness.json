        "mainbody": "'''Shivering sickness''' was a common disease carried by [[Chult]]an swarming and stinging insects, like [[mosquito]]s, or their giant counterparts, like [[Monstrous centipede|centipedes]], [[giant scorpion|scorpions]], [[giant wasp|wasps]], and others.",
        "Effects": "Shivering sickness had a short incubation period, showing symptoms the following day after infection (usually within two to twelve hours). The affected suffered from confusion, blurred vision, reduced body temperature, chattering teeth, and shakes. The infection also slowed natural healing as well as made it challenging to perform even mundane tasks. The sickness was not deadly, and eventually, it was purged from the affected's bodies.\n\nThe disease was known to affect [[humanoid]]s and [[giant]]s.\n\nShivering sickness could easily be avoided via the use of [[insect repellent|insect-repelling]] [[salve]]s and [[incense]] prepared in Chult. The salve needed to cover the entirety of exposed skin to be effective.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], shivering sickness was commonplace among visitors to Chult. The inhabitants of [[Camp Vengeance]] were some of the affected humanoids. The ruins of [[Omu]] were teeming with vermin carriers of the disease."
