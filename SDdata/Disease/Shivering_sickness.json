        "mainbody": "hivering sickness was a common disease carried by Chultan swarming and stinging insects, like mosquitos, or their giant counterparts, like centipedes, scorpions, wasps, and others.\nShivering sickness had a short incubation period, showing symptoms the following day after infection (usually within two to twelve hours). The affected suffered from confusion, blurred vision, reduced body temperature, chattering teeth, and shakes. The infection also slowed natural healing as well as made it challenging to perform even mundane tasks. The sickness was not deadly, and eventually, it was purged from the affecteds bodies.\nThe disease was known to affect humanoids and giants.\nShivering sickness could easily be avoided via the use of insect-repelling salves and incense prepared in Chult. The salve needed to cover the entirety of exposed skin to be effective.\nIn the late 15 century DR, shivering sickness was commonplace among visitors to Chult. The inhabitants of Camp Vengeance were some of the affected humanoids. The ruins of Omu were teeming with vermin carriers of the disease."
