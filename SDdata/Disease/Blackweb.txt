Blackweb was a fungal disease affecting grapes.
This blight occurred on grape vines grown in a cold, damp environment, resulting in a powdery mildew. The grapes were bitter and stunted as a result.
The grape vines grown in Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR were often afflicted with blackweb, owing to the climate. Despite this, they were used for the local sour wine known as sund.
