'''Mindfire''' was a [[disease]] that affected the brain, leading to a deterioration in intellect and ultimately to stupor. 

The term "mindfire" was also sometimes used colloquially to refer to head pain{{Cite web/Realmslore/Semberholme (Part One)}} or to [[psionics]].{{cite web |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] |https://web.archive.org/web/20221122102907/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1331635343230193665|title= Ed's Twitter |date=2020-11-05 |accessdate=2023-05-27}}

==Acquisition==
Mindfire was contracted via inhaling the disease, after which symptoms began to appear about a day later.

Mindfire was one of several diseases that could be inflicted using the ''[[contagion]]'' spell. There were was also a [[psionic power]] that could [[Mindfire (power)|spread mindfire]] to a victim.

==Effects==
The disease was named for the experience of feeling that one's brain was burning and feverish, which was the principle symptom of the early stages of the disease. Sufferers at this stage became easily confused in hectic situations like combat and were more susceptible to [[psionic|psychic]] assaults. As the disease advanced, it ate away at the sufferers' mental competency. They would enter into a stupor if they were injured, and in the latest stages of the disease, mindfire could render the sufferer catatonic.

==History==
A [[wizard]] at [[Tiru Tel-Quessir]] in [[Cormanthyr]] once accidentally created a [[magic]]ally enhanced strain of mindfire that incubated in one minute and could advance incredibly rapidly. He managed to magically seal the disease inside his lab and alert his brethren before his mind deteriorated, at which point he took his own life.{{Cite web enhancement/Tower of Life and Tomb of Death|5}}

Noxious gasses in the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]] were said to carry mindfire. The disease could also be encountered in the [[Underdark]].

At some point prior to the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[lich]] [[Zzarka]] created a disease she called "[[cacklefire]]" by combining mindfire and [[cackle fever]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Strongholds of Undeath Portals}}
