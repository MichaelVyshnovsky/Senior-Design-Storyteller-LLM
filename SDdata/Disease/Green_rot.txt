'''Green rot''', also known as '''scaly death''' was a magical disease associated with the deity [[Talona]], the Mother of All Plagues.

==Acquisition==
This disease was a gift and spreading it was a divine ability bestowed on the priests of Talona, called malagents, by the Lady of Poison. Their ability to ''[[cause disease]]'' by touch once a day resulted in the target being infected with the ''scaly death''.

==Effects==
The two stages of the disease names were as follows: the debilitating stage was referred to as the 'scaly death' and its fatal stage as the 'green rot'.

The first clue of the disease setting in was an acute loss of intelligence and dulling of mental facilities.

The green rot was named after the greenish rot and decay that spread over the victim's skin. The scaly death caused the diseased's bones to soften and become weak whilst the flesh was peeling and flaking like gruesome scales. These symptoms led to the eventual failure of the diseased's bodily functions and death.
