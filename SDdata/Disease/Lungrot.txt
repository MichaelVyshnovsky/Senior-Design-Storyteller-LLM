'''Lungrot''' was a respiratory [[disease]] found only in the [[Underdark]].

==Acquisition==
The disease affected air-breathing creatures, and was acquired by breathing the air inside ancient Underdark ruins. Most often, it infected creatures who had become trapped or sealed inside such places. Symptoms would set in within one to four hours.

==Effects==
Lungrot caused a steady decline in a sufferer's stamina and, to a slightly lesser extent, their physical strength.

==Treatment==
Only [[magic]]al healing, such as ''[[remove disease]]'', could allow an infected individual to recover from lungrot.
