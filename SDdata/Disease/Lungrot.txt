Lungrot was a respiratory disease found only in the Underdark.
The disease affected air-breathing creatures, and was acquired by breathing the air inside ancient Underdark ruins. Most often, it infected creatures who had become trapped or sealed inside such places. Symptoms would set in within one to four hours.
Lungrot caused a steady decline in a sufferers stamina and, to a slightly lesser extent, their physical strength.
Only magical healing, such as remove disease, could allow an infected individual to recover from lungrot.
