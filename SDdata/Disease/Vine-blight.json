        "History": "An outbreak of vine-blight in the {{YearlinkName|1252}}, led to a dearth of [[wine]] throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. That summer in [[Tethyr]], peasants from the [[Purple Hills]] attempted to recoup their losses by selling what little wine they had produced to the [[North]], but did so at the expense of providing their usual yearly payment of wine to their lord, the Duke of [[Ankramir]]. Having expected his usual tithe, the Duke declared the peasants to be in revolt&mdash;the so-called [[Wine Blight Insurrection]]&mdash;and sent his soldiers to confiscate the wine and round up those responsible."
