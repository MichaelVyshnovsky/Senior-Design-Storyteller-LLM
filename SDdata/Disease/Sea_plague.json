        "mainbody": "'''Sea plague''' was the [[disease]] bestowed upon the crew of the ''[[Lustrous Lass]]'' by the [[Gloom Crone]] of the [[Crone Island]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Effects": "Those afflicted suffered from feeling ill, exhaustion, followed by profuse secretion of thick [[oil]]y sweat, and death within less than a [[tenday]] after infection.",
        "History": "''Sea plague'' surfaced in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when the crew of the ''Lustrous Lass'' sailed to the Crone Island and the captain made a deal with the isle's [[hag]]. Several days later after the deal was made, Captain [[Harfang]] discovered the perils of dealing with hags and succumbed to an illness. She locked herself away in her cabin to contain the disease and hid away from sinister scratching coming from her baggage. The scratching came from a ''[[curse]]d'' [[imp]] who spread the sea plague that ended the lives of the entire ''Lustrous Lass''' crew in a bit over a tenday after the deal was made.\n\nSoon after, the ''Lustrous Lass'' drifted into [[Baldur's Gate]]'s docks with everyone onboard dead. The [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries were dispatched to investigate the ship of the dead and placed the vessel under quarantine. The Fists did not know what ended the crew's lives, a [[poison]] or a disease. They found a basket of strange rotting fruit that they thought could be the cause, while one Fist detected an aura of wickedness around the ''Lustrous Lass'', possibly becoming infected by the sea plague during investigation as the Fist suddenly felt exhausted and left the quarantined vessel for home in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]."
