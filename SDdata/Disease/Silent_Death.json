Even in relatively lightly hit areas, as much as 15&ndash20% of the population died. Imaskari citizens had flocked to temples for aid, but as their priests were unable to provide relief from the magic-resistant illness, this led to bitterness and ultimately violence as the people turned against their gods and killed their priests.
