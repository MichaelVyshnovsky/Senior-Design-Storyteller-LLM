        "Effects": "The [[disease]] had a high mortality rate, and could not be cured by [[divine magic]].",
        "History": "The outbreak of the plague ravaged Lower Imaskar, and coincided with a mysterious blight that destroyed crops and caused famine. Even in relatively lightly hit areas, as much as 15&ndash;20% of the population died. [[Imaskari]] citizens had flocked to temples for aid, but as their [[priest]]s were unable to provide relief from the [[magic]]-resistant illness, this led to bitterness and ultimately violence as the people turned against their [[god]]s and killed their priests. Lower Imaskar was said to have only survived the decade following the Silent Death's appearance thanks to misfortune and mismanagement among their enemies.\n\nWhile the plague did spread north, it did not make it all the way to [[Imaskar#Middle_Kingdoms_Period|Upper Imaskar]], instead stopping in the lands that would later become the [[Endless Wastes]].\n\nThe outbreak of the Silent Death marked the start of [[Shartra]] (\"darkness\"), a period from â€“4370 DR to {{Yearlink|-3920}}, during which Lower Imaskar&mdash;desperate for labor to rebuild and rekindle their realm&mdash;kidnapped and [[slavery|enslaved]] tens of thousands of people from [[Earth|another world]], whose descendants would come to be known as the [[Mulan]]."
