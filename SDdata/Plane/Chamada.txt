Chamada, also known as the Molten, Maanzecorian, and Memnor.
Of all four layers of Gehenna, Chamada was the most violent and inhospitable. Sustained volcanic activity kept the slopes constantly flowing with thick lava, to the point that solid ground was only rarely found. The entire layer glowed bright red from the incandescent rock, brightly enough for the entire mount to be visible from the first layer of Khalas despite the enormous distance between the two. From the point of view of an observer in the first layer, Chamada appeared to be a bright-red burning moon.
Vast rivers of magma flowed and twisted endlessly down the slopes of Chamada, cooling in some locations only to explode in others, creating plumes of lava, secondary volcanoes, and veering in different directions.
Due to this eternally ongoing eruption, the air of Chamada was permanently filled with ash, which could entirely block visibility in some locations.
The layer was orbited by the flying city of Nimicri, which resembled a small moon but was actually a single living organism.
