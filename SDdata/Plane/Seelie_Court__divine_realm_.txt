The '''Seelie Court''' was the [[divine realm]] that was home to the [[Seelie Court|pantheon of the same name]].

==Description==
Wherever it was, the Court manifested as a calm woodland full of glades, either cloaked in eternal twilight or warmed by gentle sunlight.

The Seelie Court mimicked the appearance of nature. Trees formed columns and living ceilings, phosphorescent flowers bloomed where lanterns might be, and semi-precious jewels floated down waterways.{{Cite web/Fey Feature/Seelie and Unseelie Courts}}

==Cosmography==
The Seelie Court wandered through the planes of [[Arborea]], [[Ysgard]], and the [[Beastlands]] according to Titania's whim. Time was known to flow differently within its borders.

==Notable Locations==
[[Verenestra]] was known to have her own bower in the Seelie Court, consisting of a grove of silver [[birch]], larch, and [[willow]] trees all decorated with silver filigree.<ref>

Most of the inhabitants, however, lived in open-air conditions. There were no settlements.

==Inhabitants==
The Seelie Court's most notable inhabitants were the deities who lived there, particularly Queen [[Titania]], the ruler of the pantheon, and King [[Oberon]].

However, a number of other [[fey]] also dwelt in the realm. Beautiful but elitist, these courtiers thrived on politicking and gossip, with the court fey forming endless cliques and factions. They only admitted pure-blooded fey to their ranks, and, when dealing with outsiders, preferred those with fey, [[elf|elven]], or [[celestial]] blood.
