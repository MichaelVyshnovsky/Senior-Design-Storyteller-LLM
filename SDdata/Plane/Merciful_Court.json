        "mainbody": "The Merciful Court was the divine realm of Sharindlar, the dwarven goddess of healing and mercy.\nThe realm was a circle of standing stones located on a foothill. It hosted nightly dances in honor of Sharindlar.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, the Merciful Court was located in Nidavellir, the third layer of Ysgard. While in the World Tree cosmology, it was located in Dwarfhome, a celestial plane shared by the members of the Dwarven pantheon. Due to its location near the bulk of Dwarfhomes main mountain, Sharindlar was able to moderate interactions between Moradin and all other dwarven deities, including even the duergar deities who dwelt in Hammergrim.\nThe realm was inhabited by Ysgardian dwarves, as well as dryads, einheriar, foo dogs, hollyphants, korreds, lillendi, linnorms, sylphs, and sunflies who served the Shining Dancer."
