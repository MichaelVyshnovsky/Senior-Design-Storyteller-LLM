The realm itself consisted of brown hills that were chaotically aligned around the center steading, the actual Steading of Grolantor, which was one story&mdashin giant size&mdashhigh but consisted of several miles of interconnected wooden rooms. Between these hills was grassland and on the hills were forts inhabited by hill giants. There were about a hundred of these forts and the ones in better shape had the deitys favor at the moment.\nThe realm was dotted with mysterious holes that looked like burrows dug up by some unknown creature or looked like theyd appeared naturally. Entering these holes created paranoia in the mind of the person entering, making them react in a fearful manner but robbing any fighting skills they otherwise had.\nOne could buy vaath skin and goods manufactured from it in the divine realm. Otherwise, there was nothing of note in the realm.\nGrolantor ruled the realm. He was served by giants who hunted and fed their god with their spoils. Travelers had an uncertain fate ready for them. They could get eaten by the giants or Grolantor, they could be bribed to serve Grolantor, or they could be left alone.\nGrolantor Sating the realms rulers appetite was one reason why its inhabitants hunted.\nOnazak Throateater The hill giant proxy of Grolantor, she was not only strong but also intelligent."
