        "mainbody": "The '''Steading''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Grolantor]].",
        "Location": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the Steading was located in [[Carceri]] in the layer of [[Cathrys]].\n\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]], this realm was located in the [[plane]] of [[Jotunheim]].\n\nIn the [[World Axis cosmology]], this realm was located in the [[Elemental Chaos]].",
        "Description": "The realm was located in the grassland of Cathrys, except that the grassland abruptly ended at the boundary to the divine realm. The realm itself consisted of brown hills that were chaotically aligned around the center steading, the actual Steading of Grolantor, which was one story&mdash;in giant size&mdash;high but consisted of several miles of interconnected wooden rooms. Between these hills was grassland and on the hills were forts inhabited by [[hill giant]]s. There were about a hundred of these forts and the ones in better shape had the [[deity]]'s favor at the moment.",
        "Features": "The realm was dotted with mysterious holes that looked like burrows dug up by some unknown creature or looked like they'd appeared naturally. Entering these holes created paranoia in the mind of the person entering, making them react in a fearful manner but robbing any fighting skills they otherwise had.",
        "Trade": "One could buy [[vaath]] skin and goods manufactured from it in the divine realm. Otherwise, there was nothing of note in the realm.",
