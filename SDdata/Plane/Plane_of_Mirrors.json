        "Cosmography": "It was possible to access the Plane of Mirrors with the use of a specific [[spell]] and an item such as a large mirror. Once in the Plane of Mirrors, it was possible to exit through another mirror, leading to another plane in the [[multiverse]], whether it be an [[Outer Plane]], [[Inner Plane]], or the same plane one originally came from.\n\nThe \"floor\" of the Plane of Mirrors was in fact a shared border with the [[Ethereal plane]], accessible by the spaces in between each mirror.\n\n[[Radiant energy]] \"leaked\" into the plane from the [[Positive Energy plane]], repairing its mirrors and healing any living beings that were not imbued with [[necrotic energy|necrotic]] or [[Negative energy]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Though largely unknown to many of the Realms, the Plane of Mirrors did hold some inhabitants. Curiously, when one stepped into this transitive plane, a mirror version of oneself would also spawn. The mirror version would have completely the opposite alignment and even be left-handed if the original version was right-handed. The mirror-self could only leave the Plane of Mirrors if it killed its original self.\n\nThere were barely any races native to this plane, though [[mirror mephit]]s were known to lurk here. Such mephits were frequently summoned by [[Zhentarim]]-allied [[demons]], as well as the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].",
        "History": "The ancient [[bronze dragon]] [[Nymmurh]] was the protector of the [[Waterdhavian]] House [[Silmerhelve]], and laired over the [[Moonshae Isles]]. However, during the most recent [[Rage of Dragons]], he miscast a spell through a mirror. In doing so, he was sent to the Plane of Mirrors, and became obsessed with learning about the [[nerra]] race."
