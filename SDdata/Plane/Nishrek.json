        "mainbody": "'''Nishrek''' was a [[fiendish plane]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]] model (and then later, the whole cube) as described by the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model. which tended to wander or be forced out of various previous homes.",
        "Description": {
            "Great Wheel Model": "As a realm in Acheron, Nishrek was a square, flat, barren plain broken only by trenches dug for defense, conical pits and mountains, perhaps a segment of the River [[Styx]], and the occasional iron citadel, which the orcs and other evil races merely occupied until the tide of battle pushed or pulled them elsewhere. The main conflicts were between the orcs and the [[goblin]]s, but there was plenty of inter-tribe squabbling as well.",
            "World Tree Model": "When the World Tree cosmology supplanted the Great Wheel model, Nishrek became its own plane, which the orcs had all to themselves, but without much improvement in the environment, although there was at least a sea and some hills.{{Cite web/Manual of the Planes: Frequently Asked Questions|3}} <ref group=\"note\">The Manual of the Planes FAQ states that Nishrek was \"similar to the first layer of Ysgard, but dangerous and evil.\" The entry on page 91 of the ''[[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition]]'' describes Ysgard as \"rough and wild\" with \"hilly terrain leading down to cold seas.\" It was an immeasurable plane with battlements, entrenchments, and fortresses, contested over nightly by petitioners who healed quickly and even regenerated lost limbs. If they fell in battle, they received a ''[[true resurrection]]'' at the next sunset and joined the battle again. Each tribe vied for the favor of Gruumsh, whom they believed would someday declare a winner and thereby raise the status of their tribe above all others.",
            "World Axis Model": "When the [[Spellplague]] caused Nishrek to be cast adrift upon the [[Astral Sea]], it changed from being a practically limitless plain to a finite [[dominion]] with a more varied landscape&mdash;dense forests, broiling deserts, flinty badlands, murky rivers and foreboding seas&mdash;all bearing the ravages of constant war. Like [[Warrior's Rest]], this plane tallied untold deaths but no losses, as each combatant rose to fight again and again."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The only creatures tenacious enough to call Nishrek home were swarms of [[Hellwasp swarm|hellwasps]], which could ruin the best-laid battle plans very quickly.) petitioners made up the vast majority of the population, organized by tribe and faction. After the Spellplague, [[ogres]] and [[troll]]s saw Nishrek in the [[afterlife]], when [[Vaprak]] became an [[exarch]] of Gruumsh.",
        "Realms": "* [[Bahgtru]] the Leg Breaker made his home in Gruumsh's [[Iron Fortress]]. Prior to this, his home was one of the smaller cubes that floated in orbit around the moon-sized block that held Nishrek in [[Acheron]].\n* [[Gruumsh]] the One-Eyed God was the primary power that shaped Nishrek and built his Iron Fortress large enough to hold armies (when he deigned to allow them in).\n* [[Ilneval]] the Hoard Leader's fate after the Spellplague was unknown. Prior to his disappearance, he shared the Iron Fortress with Gruumsh and Bahgtru. During his time on Acheron, he also had a geometrically shaped satellite.\n* [[Luthic]] the Cave Mother carved her lair out of solid rock and iron with her incredibly long claws deep beneath the Iron Fortress.\n* [[Obould]] was once [[King Obould Many-Arrows]] in Faer√ªn until he became an exarch of Gruumsh and joined the orcish pantheon in the Iron Fortress.\n* [[Shargaas]] the Stalker Below\n* [[Vaprak]], god of ogres and trolls, also made his home in caverns somewhere on this plane after he became an exarch of Gruumsh.\n* [[Yurtrus]] White Hands had a towering hill named [[Fleshslough]] overlooking the battlefields of Nishrek, where the threat of permanent death by unimaginably horrible means was enough to motivate most petitioners to give their best effort in battle."
