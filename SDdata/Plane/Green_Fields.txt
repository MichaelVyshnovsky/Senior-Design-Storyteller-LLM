'''Green Fields''' was the celestial home of the [[halfling pantheon]]. It was also the home of the souls of deceased good [[halflings]].

==Description==
As its name aptly implied, Green Fields consisted of a green field expanding ever outward in every direction.
===Cosmography===
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Green Fields was located in [[Venya]], the third layer of the plane of [[Mount Celestia]]. In the [[World Tree cosmology]] it was its own [[celestial plane]].

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], [[Gromph Baenre]] unintentionally visited the Green Fields during a spell battle with the [[Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]].

==Notable inhabitants==
[[Dietr]] was a halfling from [[Luiren]] who dwelt in Green Fields after his death. When Gromph left the plane, he saw an opportunity to return to [[Faer√ªn]] to help his mother and followed the [[drow]] back to [[Menzoberranzan]], where he was promptly turned into an [[undead]] [[huecuva]]. Gromph had no sympathy for Dietr and forced him to go up against the Lichdrow; Dietr was easily destroyed.
