Even so, the canals were polluted and clogged, spilling effluvium all throughout Maladomini.",
        "Geography": "In terms of geography, Maladomini was very similar to [[Malbolge]], at least during the period it was under the control of [[Moloch]] (and by extension the control of Baalzebul as well). It was hot to the touch,{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|44}} and filled with stinking gasses and smoke, earth tremors and underground explosions, huge caves and caverns, and pits of fire.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|26-27, 29}}\n\nThere were several distinguishing elements however. [[Granite]] was commonly seen across the surface, and from the earth erupted not only the layer's black ichor, but also lava, the volcanic cascades swelling the magma rivers. These rivers contributed to the great sea of lava that seemingly encircled the entire plane; within that sea was a ring of volcanic mountains, and it was within that ring that the layer's civilization sat.\n\nMost notable of the differences however were Maladomini's despoiled qualities. Under a sky the shade of blue-black blood, sentient chunks of polluted matter crawled out from the banks of sludge-ridden streams only to choke on toxic air and quickly expire. Whatever remnants of stunted trees that were still dying as opposed to dead eventually collapsed, succumbed to rot, or spontaneously burst into damp, smoldering flames upon contact with the slag. \"Natural\" sources of light could be found in the dim, sickly radiance emitted by green flames found on the layer, which were either flickering fires fed by the fluids seeping out from the ground along the river banks or drifting, blazing spheres.",
        "Cosmography": {
            "World Axis": "In the [[World Axis cosmology]] model, the Nine Hells were a planet-shaped [[astral dominion]] floating in the [[Astral Sea]], no longer of infinite size nor consisting of layers. In this cosmology, Maladomini was one of the largest of the Nine Hells, a subterranean maze of winding tunnels, Sludge rivers flowed through the centers of the tunnels, some illuminated by green fire and others stewing in foul darkness.\n\nThe branching tunnels of Maladomini linked the lower Hells of Malbolge, Cania, and even [[Nessus]] together. A marble boulevard lined with hideous statues, known as the [[Road of Perdition]], led from Malbolge to Maladomini, and Maladomini's tunnels eventually connected to the cold cavern of Cania. In the World Axis, the [[River Styx]] flowed through Maladomini to conclude in Cania's glaciers."

        "Notable Locations": {
            "Divine Realms": "* [[Xibalba]], a section of the city-palace of Malagard where the [[Maztican pantheon]] came to play the [[Ball Game]]. It was filled with a constantly changing array of buildings in the typical [[Maztica]]n style, the only constant being the great [[Ball Court]] itself."
        },
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Devils": "The greatest danger of Maladomini was not any feature of the environment, but the devils under Baalzebul's command. Other devils that could be found there included [[imp]]s, [[nupperibo]]s\n\nThe hosts of Maladomini consisted primarily of companies of cornugons (company in this case meaning 111 individual devils rather than the usual 333).{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|38}} There were 60 companies under the command of Abigor and 28 under Zepar, who performed various roles ranging from warriors to messengers to laborers. The spinagons attended to the needs and wants of the cornugon laborers, typically under the oversight of an amnizu or more rarely an [[osyluth]].\n\nPit fiends were rare on Maladomini and noticeably absent from Baalzebul's service there. The Lord of the Flies suspected all of being spies or puppets of Asmodeus, and so was reluctant to allow any of them on his plane, having tasked his generals with driving them all away. Even so, among the many infernal fiefs of Maladomini were the strongholds of quarrelsome pit fiends and [[war devil]]s.\n\nMaladomini also hosted various unique types of devils. The bizarre [[ayperobos]], creations of Baalzebul, originated in Maladomini and were rarely encountered beyond it. They prowled the misty reaches or were intentionally placed as traps by other devils for travelers. There were also [[swarm devil]]s, the corrupted [[soul]]s of [[Angel (astral)|angels]] caught lying to their masters which reformed trapped in a mass of flies that buzzed around Baalzebul. The fiends then moved to one of Maladomini's stagnant pools, starving but never dying, eagerly awaiting a mission and chance to feed.",
            "Petitioners and Planars": "Besides lesser devils, [[petitioner]]s and enslaved prisoners in Maladomini were made to dig without tools to look for more stone for the layer's cities. However, many non-devil inhabitants of Maladomini were not under the control of Baalzebul. The abandoned cities of the layer served as shelters for runaways and deserters,  petitioners who fled their tormentors, native Baatorian creatures who lost their territories, beasts from other planes who became especially lost, and [[planewalker]]s trying not to be found. The occasional attempts by Baalzebul to oust them simply caused the malcontents to flee to one of the many other cities his quest for perfection gave them the option of.\n\nAmong the varied inhabitants of Maladomini were [[human]]s, [[demihuman]]s, [[orc]]s, [[half-orc]]s, [[goblinoids]], [[kobold]]s, [[giants]], [[gith]], [[manticore]]s, [[medusae]], [[beholder]]s, [[rakshasa]]s, [[yugoloth]]s, [[hordling]]s, [[maelephant]]s, and rogue [[modron]]s and baatezu. In at least one case (a population of orcs the baatezu were trying to breed into a species of [[lawful evil]] [[troll]]s) their captives did not escape, but were abandoned in an empty city by the baatezu after they didn't shape up to their expectations. In reality the project did succeed, but wasn't given enough generations, and so the enhanced orcs spread throughout the tunnels intent to one day overthrow the masters of Maladomini.",
            "Others": "Swarms of hungry flies plagued all who ventured through Maladomini, and acted as the eyes and ears of the Lord of the Flies. The flowing sludge of the rivers prompted the spontaneous generation of a variety of [[fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[ooze]]s, such as [[black pudding]]s, [[gelatinous cube]]s, and [[Ochre jelly|ochre jellies]]. Other creatures known to inhabit the plane were [[vargouille]]s and [[hook spider]]s.\n\nBeneath the ruins of Maladomini were beings that made even the baatezu uneasy. Petitioners, whether lemures or more intelligent types, avoided these tunnels, These entities were, at least in some cases, the Ancient Baatorians, a race of infernal beings that occupied the Nine Hells long before the rise of the baatezu."

        "History": {
            "Maladomini's Fall": "Eons passed as Baalzebul achieved many victories. But Baalzebul's greatest weakness had never been his lacking competence, but his inability stop when he was ahead, his irrepressible need for total perfection in all his endeavors and the extreme actions it drove him to.\n\nFor millennia Baalzebul longed for a city befitting his greatness. He commanded his subjects to build him city after city, but was never satisfied, declaring each and every one unworthy upon its completion. had become a place of despoiled land and ruined civilization. But its fall was not yet over.\n\nReports somewhat conflicted on what exactly was the inciting incident for Maladomini's downfall. In some versions, he kicked off the [[Reckoning of Hell]], where the archdevils openly warred to take Asmodeus's throne, and it reached its climatic conclusion in Maladomini.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|4}} In a more recent version, Baalzebul conspired to depose Asmodeus in such a way as to truly qualify as a crime: altering records in his ploy to cast his master as incompetent. This plot was foiled when an unexpected surge of the [[Blood War]] demanded his participation, and his initial refusal to send soldiers he was saving for his coup prompted an investigation that revealed his misdeeds. Baalzebul refused to submit to punishment, and the other archdevils attacked Maladomini.",
            "Reign of the Slug": "Whatever the specifics of the situation, Baalzebul's realm was wracked by war and left in a state of utter devastation. And, whether for his move against Asmodeus, the insurmountable treachery of interfering with Hell's records, or for some other ineffable reason, Baalzebul was to suffer a series of punishments for his sins.\n\nBaalzebul was left to preside over the rotting cities of Maladomini,{{Cite dragon/223/The Lords of the Nine|17}} his ability to scheme neutralized by his new limitations and his attention thus shifting to gathering souls from the [[Material Plane]]. But while the ancient cities might have been beacons of glory and triumph long ago, Baalzebul, in his devotion to spreading misery, ultimately beat the capacity to make such structures out of his petitioners.\n\nOblivious to the decay of his old cities, Baalzebul always sought to improve new ones, and his servants had little choice but to continue stripping bare what little of the land was left. But rather than actually demanding renovations, Baalzebul instead spread word through his pit fiend servants that new cities had to be built from scratch, the old to be left standing as reminders of work already done and rejected. In some cases cities were to be built on new sites and the original structures remained intact if barely used, but at some point it became common practice to cannibalize the old cities for raw materials, hastening their destruction. Newer cities would be built upon the backs of the old until they all ended up below the surface, save for one.\n\nThroughout it all, Baalzebul never truly gave up on the incomplete fortress-city of Malagard, even after, upon being turned into a slug, his grand castle at its center collapsed into fecal sludge, and by order of Asmodeus was to be constantly filled with garbage. Perhaps more surprisingly, despite its capital having been reduced to excrement, Malagard was still universally agreed to be Baalzebul's greatest city yet, even by those who had seen its older incarnations.\n\nMalagard was a city of perfectly straight boulevards and countless straightly-extending, black-spired towers connected by many open and covered bridge-spans crisscrossing and slanting in all directions. Even as the rest of Maladomini was blighted, green things grew in its walls, a planar plant collection tended to by nupperibos supervised by osyluths, themselves watched by cornugons. Nearly all the layer's wealth made its way there, from tapestries to furniture to precious stones and metals.\n\nBut just as none doubted Malagard was Baalzebul's greatest city, it was equally undisputed that he would reject it just as he did all others. And so dire became the workers' dread that they slowed down in the final stages of construction, secretly self-sabotaging much of their work to delay the inevitable.",
            "Recent History": "But the denizens of Maladomini could not stall forever, and were eventually forced to present their work to Baalzebul somewhere around the 14{{th}} century DR. And, just as all foresaw, Malagard too was ultimately rejected. The incessant building and rebuilding of the city by the Slug Archduke eventually gave way to despair, and the once majestic city was left to slowly die. Still Baalzebul stayed there, often neglecting his depressing duties maintaining the Palace of Filth with his slime in favor of scheming for dominance, causing entire rooms to collapse and losing many great relics of power in the process.\n\nHowever, Maladomini's ultimate fate might still be changed. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Baalzebul finally reverted to his previous fly-headed form, the abject humiliation forbidding him from extending the transformation with any further lies. Maladomini was still a crumbling realm, but Baalzebul had recently positioned himself as a patron of redemption."
