        "mainbody": "The Great Mountain was a divine realm within the Elemental Plane of Earth belonging to Grumbar, the power of elemental earth.\nThis realm existed within the Great Wheel cosmological model.\nThe body of Grumbar took up a great portion of this divine realm, with him being to physically a part of it. Whenever he had need to speak with a visitor, Grumbar would create an elemental pocket that was suitable for their survival, such as a pocket of air. The visitor would be made to face  high wall, wherein his face would materialize to speak with them. This face was said to look a bit different to each visitor. Some speculated that the face could be that of a mere proxy, rather than Grumbar himself, though there was no way of knowing for certain."
