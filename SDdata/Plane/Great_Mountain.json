The visitor would be made to face {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} high wall, wherein his face would materialize to speak with them. This face was said to look a bit different to each visitor. Some speculated that the face could be that of a mere [[proxy]], rather than Grumbar himself, though there was no way of knowing for certain."
