The '''Bastion of Hate''' was a great fortress that served as the [[divine realm]] of [[Iyachtu Xvim]]. The Bastion was originally located in [[Gehenna]], but was subsequently relocated to the [[Abyss]]. Following Xvim's death, the fortress was claimed by a group of [[githzerai]].

{{Quote|''It's Iyachtu Xvim's realm. It's not supposed to be good.''|[[Jas]]}}

==Description==
The Bastion of Hate was a vast and blocky fortified castle made of [[basalt]]. In Gehenna, it was located on the slopes of the massive volcano [[Chamada]], and towered above the rivers of lava that surrounded it. The other side of the Bastion was protected by a thick, crescent-shaped double wall dotted with six towers. The parapets were adorned with horn-shaped spikes and the walls were armored with riveted [[iron]] plates approximately {{SI|1|inch|c|long=yes}} thick which glowed with the heat of the surrounding lava. Spartan rooms inside these walls served as mess halls, armories, and chambers for new arrivals to await formal invitation into the Bastion. A hole in the Bastion's walls allowed for access to a pool of lava that Xvim personally used to torture his prisoners and victims.

The main courtyard of the Bastion between the cliffs and walls was wide and lit by rows of torches. As one entered the fortress, there was a temple of Xvim to the right and a large tower to the left that rose high above the walls.

===Temple===
The temple was rectangular and made of black [[marble]]. It sat on a low hill and was reached by climbing a large staircase littered with bones to enter into the temple's great hall. This long room was flanked by smaller rooms&mdash;in which the resident [[priest]]s occupied themselves&mdash;as well as by an audience chamber at the rear where visitors met with the temple's high priest seated on a throne upholstered with [[human]] flesh.

===Tower===
The tower’s main door was kept barred with a gargantuan thighbone. This tower served as the seat of Xvim's power, and contained his throne room on the ground-level. that led to a trapdoor at the very top of the tall tower. All windows on the tower were magically barred to prevent intrusion.

===Defenses===
The fortress was imbued with powerful [[arcane magic]] that repelled lava and invaders alike,

Among the many weapons kept in the Bastion's armory was a large store of ''[[smokepowder]]''.

==Cosmography==
The fortress originally sat on the slopes of the great volcano Chamada, the second layer of Gehenna, amid constant lava flows. Subsequently, it was embedded into the side of a mountain in the [[Layers of the Abyss#The Spires of Rajzak|Spires of Rajzak]] located somewhere in the [[Abyss]].

==Inhabitants==
As Xvim's divine realm during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Bastion of Hate was manned by a vast army of [[yugoloth]] mercenaries&mdash;particularly [[hydroloth]]s, [[mezzoloth]]s, and [[piscoloth]]s<ref group="note">While ''[[Tymora's Luck]]'' does not identify [[mezzoloth]]s and [[piscoloth]]s by name, these are consistent with the description of [[yugoloth]]s with the features of "horned crickets" and "red lobsters" respectively.&mdash;who lived in the tunnels behind the fortress. It also hosted a number of [[humanoid]] members of Xvim’s [[church of Iyachtu Xvim|church]] who dwelt in the temple. Members of the clergy included:

* Tyrannar [[Noxxe]], the high priest in charge of the Bastion of Hate in {{Yearlink|1368}}.
* Tyrannar [[Neri (human)|Neri]], the high priest who succeeded Noxxe.
* Hatemaster [[Morr]], a priest who greeted new arrivals and would serve as a guide at the behest of Tyrannar Neri.
* Hatemaster [[Perr]], a priest who died and returned to the Bastion as a [[petitioner]], and was then assigned to the lowly task of gatekeeper.
* Twenty armored priests and priestesses serving as guards.
* Six priests who acted as scribes.
* More than one hundred additional guards and low-ranking priests.

Other notable inhabitants during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR included [[Ratagar]] the [[imp]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Bastion of Hate within the Abyss was home to [[demon]]s and to a small group of powerful yet cautious githzerai.

==History==
The Bastion of Hate was thought by some to have been built in the distant past by an unknown architect. 

Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]] and his bid to claim his father's [[portfolio]], the then-[[demigod]] Iyachtu Xvim had no divine realm, and was known to divide his time between the [[Prime Material plane]] and [[Acheron]]. Following his ascension, he established himself at the Bastion of Hate during the 1360s DR.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}},{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} Xvim sent minions to attack [[Beshaba]], the [[god]]dess of misfortune, who retaliated by personally attacking the Bastion of Hate. However, Xvim was absent, and as she prepared to wait for him, she became imprisoned in his throne room and ultimately fell into a comatose state as he siphoned her power away. Despite this, bad luck seeped from her and infected the fortress for the next two days, resulting in the deaths of the head priest, Tyrannar Noxxe, as well as the captain of the guard and over 100 lesser priests and guards. At that point, Beshaba's [[cleric]]-turned-[[exarch]] [[Walinda]] stormed the fortress alongside an army of [[barlgura]]s, [[hezrou]]s, and [[bulezau]]s. With the help of [[Joel the Rebel Bard]], the Bastion's gatekeeper was persuaded that the demons were in fact part of a simple power struggle between the Xvimlar leaders, and so the army was granted entrance and were able to storm the castle and clash with the yugoloth defenders. Walinda sacrificed herself to awaken Beshaba, at which point the Bastion of Hate had the "bad luck" to be struck by a massive earthquake. While the fortress itself was too strong to be damaged by the quake, Mount Chamada was not: the ledge on which the Bastion was located was dislodged, leaving the fortress to slide violently down the volcanic mountain.

{{Quote|''Xvim sent creatures to attack me in my realm. He must have been trying to force me to use my power. I went to confront him in his realm, but he was nowhere to be found. I sent the Bastion of Hate tumbling down Mount Chamada, and still the little weasel did not appear.''|Beshaba}}


As of the time of Xvim's death in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Bastion of Hate had been relocated to the Abyss where it appeared to be carved into the side of a mountain in the bleak badlands of the Spires of Rajzak.

Following the events of the [[Spellplague]], Xvim’s ownership of the Bastion was forgotten. Throughout the 15{{th}} century DR, the mighty structure proved to be one of the only buildings capable of withstanding the dangers of the Spires of Rajzak, and thus became a popular base for the local demonic hordes. As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a group of githzerai had begun to explore the Bastion with the intention of converting it into a monastery.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some feared that Iyachtu Xvim had the power to extend a ghostly hand into the Material Plane to snatch folk away to the Bastion of Hate.
