The '''Elemental Plane of Earth''' was an [[Inner Plane]] of the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] and the [[World Tree cosmology]] models. After the [[Spellplague]], the Elemental Plane of Earth collapsed into the [[Elemental Chaos]], mixing with all the other Inner Planes. [[Earth (element)|Earth]] is one of the four elements and two energies that make up the known universe and therefore of keen interest to cosmologists. The abundance of large [[gem]]s and huge ore deposits lured many greedy prospectors to brave the significant dangers of this plane.

==Cosmology ==
According to the Great Wheel cosmology model, the Elemental Plane of Earth could be reached via the [[Ethereal Plane]], an adjacent elemental plane, or by an [[elemental vortex]]. If traveling through the [[Deep Ethereal]], a brown [[Ethereal curtain|''curtain of vaporous color'']] indicated the boundary of the Plane of Earth's Border Ethereal region. Once in the Border Ethereal, a traveler could observe the Plane of Earth and be detected by its denizens. Using the [[Great Wheel cosmology#Basic Structure|spherical model]], this plane was adjacent to the para-elemental planes of [[Paraelemental Plane of Ooze|Ooze]] and [[Paraelemental Plane of Magma|Magma]] and the quasi-elemental planes of [[Quasielemental Plane of Mineral|Minerals]] and [[Quasielemental Plane of Dust|Dust]]. Temporary gates could be created by the ''[[plane shift]]''&nbsp; spell or the abilities of high level [[druid]]s.

In the World Tree cosmology model, the [[Astral Plane]] connected all planes with the [[Prime Material Plane]] and the Ethereal Plane was only used for journeying between locations on the Prime. The Elemental Plane of Earth was not connected or coterminous with any other elemental plane. The spell ''[[astral projection]]''&nbsp; could be used to reach the Plane of Earth via a moss [[granite]] ''color pool''. Additionally, the ''[[gate]]''&nbsp; and ''[[plane shift]]''&nbsp; spells could be used to open a temporary portal to this plane, but could be extremely dangerous unless the destination was previously scouted. To reach the Plane of Earth by means of a ''plane shift'' spell required a zinc fork tuned to the note of A.{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|43}}

An unusual ability granted by [[Moradin]] to his ardent followers, the [[Hammer of Moradin|Hammers of Moradin]], allowed them to use the Earth Plane as a [[transitive plane]] much like the ''[[shadow walk]]'' spell allowed spellcasters to skirt the edge of the [[Shadow Plane]] and quickly travel between locations on the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime Plane]].

==Description==
{{quote|It is a place of hidden riches.<br />It is a wall against all foes.<br />It is a grave for the greedy.

}}
The Elemental Plane of Earth was an infinite expanse of solid matter pockmarked by bubbles of other elements and riddled with fissures and tunnels created by burrowing creatures or the occasional small mining operation. Ensconced in a few of these pockets were trading outposts and the rare hidden wizard fortress. Open spaces were gradually filled by the relentless shifting or until their eyes reached an open space where [[darkvision]] could operate or a source of light could be produced. Hearing was actually enhanced while encased in earth, to the point where travelers could detect any movement through the rock within a certain radius of their position.

As described by the Great Wheel model, the solid earth changed in proximity to the para- and quasi-elemental planes. A native guide was necessary to find these border regions and each had their own dangers. Near the Plane of Ooze, more water was present and the rock gradually lost cohesion. Approaching the Plane of Magma the temperature rose until the rock glowed with heat and became viscous. Proximity to the Negative Material plane dessicated the earth and caused it to crumble to dust. Toward the Positive Material plane, veins of ore, crystal, and gems became richer and more prevalent, finally crossing the border to the quasi-elemental plane of Minerals.

Every type of rock, soil, mineral, metal ore, sand, and dirt could be found here in abundance, ranging from [[wikipedia:en:talc|talc]] soft to [[marble]] tough to [[diamond]] hard. Mining operations tended to be small and short-lived because the movement of the substance of the plane and intense gravity caused cave-ins, and the native population defended their territory and/or food supply.

===Notable Locations===
*The [[Great Dismal Delve]]
*The [[Sevenfold Mazework]]
*The [[Hidden Fulcrum]]
*The [[Pale River]]
*The [[Iron Crucible]]
*The Aviary was a gigantic air-filled cavern inhabitated by a colony of [[avariel]]; due to its effective lack of gravity it was a paradise for all who enjoyed flying.

===Divine Realms===
*[[Geb]] of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] had a realm here called [[the Caverns under the Stars]].<ref>
*[[Grumbar]], the Lord of the Earth, Gnarly One, King of the Land Below the Roots, Boss of Earth Elementals,{{Cite web enhancement/Deities|6}}  was thought to be a mountain-sized earth elemental with god-like powers that rarely granted audiences.
* [[Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil]], Great Khan of the Dao, the Fountain of Wealth, the Perfect Compass, Atamen of the Mountain's Roots, and other titles lived in the [[Great Dismal Delve]] in a palace called the Sevenfold Mazework.
*[[Ogremoch]], Prince of Evil Earth Creatures, had a citadel called Stonemire atop a large mesa within a huge pocket of vacuum near the paraplane of Magma.
*[[Sunnis]], Princess of Good Earth Creatures, resided in a fortress called Sandfall.

The matter of the plane itself came to life, with [[earth elemental]]s being the most numerous creatures on the plane, Then there were the alien-looking [[khargra]], [[xorn]], and [[xaren]] with tri-fold symmetric bodies and a taste for metal. All natives and some creatures with an earth-affinity could move through the plane like a fish through water, the rock flowing around them and closing back up again, leaving no tunnel.In 1st and 2nd editions, creatures like [[xorn]] adjusted their molecular structure in order to pass though solid rock. This operation took a combat round and made them vulnerable to a ''[[phase door]]'' spell.

Immigrants and visitors to the Elemental Plane of Earth included [[basilisk]]s (greater), [[chaggrin]], the [[dao]], [[dwarves]], an occasional [[blue dragon|blue]] or [[copper dragon]], [[galeb duhr]], [[jann]]i, [[lava children]], [[mephit]]s of the earth and salt subtypes, [[sandling]]s, [[stone giant]]s, [[thoqqua]], and [[wraith]]s.
