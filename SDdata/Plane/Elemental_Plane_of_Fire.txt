The '''Elemental Plane of Fire''' was an [[Inner Plane]] of the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] and the [[World Tree cosmology]] models. After the [[Spellplague]], the Elemental Plane of Fire collapsed into the [[Elemental Chaos]], mixing with all the other Inner Planes. Fire is one of the four elements and two energies that make up the known universe and more than any other element has fascinated sentient beings since the beginning of time. The flickering of a candle, the spark of a flint and steel, or the dying embers of a campfire, all have the potential to grow and engulf the world in flame&mdash;can a drop of water, a breath of air, or a mote of dust do the same? Elemental fire is pure flame that does not require air or fuel to burn and can take on a solid, liquid, or gaseous state, yet it will ignite and consume anything flammable and unprotected from fire.

==Cosmology==
According to the Great Wheel cosmology model, the Elemental Plane of Fire could be reached via the [[Ethereal Plane]], an adjacent elemental plane, or by an [[elemental vortex]]. and a vortex to the [[Elemental Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] atop [[Jabal Turab]], the Mount of Dust. If traveling through the Deep Ethereal, a red ''curtain of vaporous color'' indicated the boundary of the Plane of Fire's Border Ethereal region. Once in the Border Ethereal, a traveler could observe the Plane of Fire and be detected by its denizens. Using the [[Great Wheel cosmology#Basic Structure|spherical model]], this plane was adjacent to the para-elemental planes of [[Paraelemental Plane of Smoke|Smoke]] and [[Paraelemental Plane of Magma|Magma]] and the quasi-elemental planes of [[Quasielemental Plane of Radiance|Radiance]] and [[Quasielemental Plane of Ash|Ash]]. Temporary gates could be created by the ''[[plane shift]]''&nbsp; spell or the abilities of high-level [[druid]]s.

As described by the World Tree cosmology model, the [[Astral Plane]] connected all planes with the [[Prime Material Plane]] and the Ethereal Plane was only used for journeying between locations on the Prime. The Elemental Plane of Fire was not connected or coterminous with any other elemental plane. The spell ''[[astral projection]]''&nbsp; could be used to reach the Plane of Fire via a [[fire opal]] ''color pool''.<ref group="note">The text of the [[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition|''Manual of the Planes'' (3rd edition)]] in Table 5-1 on page 49 describes the color pool as having the color of "fire emerald", but this is probably a mistake because no such stone exists in the ''Forgotten Realms''. The illustration on the previous page shows the color to be very much like that of a [[fire opal]], which does exist. Additionally, the ''[[gate]]''&nbsp; and ''[[plane shift]]''&nbsp; spells could be used to open a temporary portal to this plane. To reach the Plane of Fire by means of a ''plane shift'' spell required a [[copper]] fork tuned to the note of A.{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|43}}

Arriving on the Plane of Fire was like stepping into the flaming maw of an ancient [[red dragon]]; if one didn't have protection or immunity from temperatures high enough to melt stone then death was swift. The following discussion assumes a visitor and all their clothing and gear had this capability and either did not need to breathe or could compensate for a superheated, often toxic atmosphere that could immolate one from the inside (think ''[[cloudkill]]'' plus ''[[incendiary cloud]]''). In general, the more fluid the elemental fire, the hotter it was and the more damage it did to unprotected material. Permanent physical structures were very rare.

Unlike the other three elemental planes, the Plane of Fire had normal gravity and a landscape, although most of the "ground" was made primarily of loosely packed elemental fire and felt like walking in a swamp of hot coals.

If the Plane of Fire had weather, it was of course hot and deadly. Rains of hot ash moved about like thunderstorms, threatening those on or near the ground with hot embers and blinding ash. Easier to avoid but just as deadly were the rivers of magma and "firefalls". Matter from other planes either evaporated, burned to ash, or melted into magma. Magma mixed with elemental fire formed a rapidly moving, incredibly hot slurry that coursed around the terrain and occasionally cascaded over a cliff edge to create a firefall, often manifesting an elemental vortex in the spectacular display. Cold spots could even be found where it felt like the middle of the [[Raurin]] desert at midday.

The dangers of the plane could not be overstated, but those that survived the trip saw wonders and beauty at nearly every turn. Flame colors spanned the rainbow, from the vermilion of a forge hearth to the yellow-white of heated iron, from the blues and greens of alchemical reactions to the familiar candle-flame yellows and oranges. The conflagration formed fountains, jets, sheets, rivers, waves, walls, rains, cascades, clouds, swirls, and pits of brilliant incandescence on a scale found nowhere else.

===City of Brass===
One famous refuge from the destructive heat was the [[City of Brass]], home of the [[efreet]]. At the will of the grand sultan, the city was protected from the pervasive smoke and flames, and visitors enjoyed unrestricted vision and uncomfortable yet tolerable temperatures, but walls and surfaces were still hot enough to burn unprotected flesh on contact. The city sat in a bowl of golden brass 40 miles (64 kilometers) in diameter that floated about the plane or hovered over a huge disk of [[obsidian]] that was cracked from the heat. Architecture included soaring towers, grand minarets, and everything from tool sheds to palaces made of brass. The treasure vaults of the grand sultan, and his wrath towards any who attempted to acquire even a single piece, were legendary.

===The Elemental Foundation of Fire===
{{main|Onyx Tower}}
An important feature of the plane was the Elemental Foundation of Fire, one of four magical switches (one in each of the four elemental planes) that when activated caused the [[Onyx Tower]] to rise on the Prime Material Plane.

==Inhabitants==
[[File:City_of_brass-5e.jpg|thumb|260px|''Two efreet in the City of Brass.'']]
Surprisingly many creatures and races could tolerate and even thrive in the Elemental Plane of Fire. First and foremost were the [[fire elemental]]s, of course, being constructed directly from the substance of the plane itself. They could assume the form of animals or monsters from the Prime Material Plane, [[fire snake]]s, [[harginn]], [[phantom stalker]]s, and [[salamander]]s were also thought to be natives of this plane, but the origins of [[magman|magmen (or magmin)]] and the [[azer]] were hotly debated.

Visitors and immigrants to the Plane of Fire included [[Brass dragon|brass]] and [[gold dragon]]s; the efreet; [[fire giant]]s; [[hell hound]]s; some [[jann]]i; [[mephit]]s of the fire, magma, and steam varieties; [[pyrohydra]]; [[rast]]; Trading missions and diplomacy brought many peoples to the [[City of Brass]], such as the [[mercane]] and [[devil]]s from the [[Nine Hells]].

The language spoken by the natives was called [[Ignan]] and it resembled the hisses and clicks of green wood being consumed by a burning campfire.

==History==
On the material plane, in the land of [[Thay]] in [[Faer√ªn]] on [[Abeir-Toril]] in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], the [[tharchion]] [[Hargrid Tenslayer]] and the [[zulkir]]s [[Aznar Thrul]] and [[Nevron]] opened a ''gate'' to the Plane of Fire and contacted [[Fyzzar]], a salamander lord, and [[Sultan]] [[Marrake]] of the efreet, bypassing Kossuth, the Lord of Flames. They offered an alliance, begging their help in conquering coastal cities in exchange for a permanent ''gate'' and a foothold in Faer√ªn in the conquered lands. The greedy elementals accepted, and launched an invasion, rapidly capturing or destroying the cities, before demanding their payment. The Thayans promptly betrayed them, expelling the efreet but missing the salamanders, who retaliated by launching the [[Salamander War]]. Aznar Thrul and the clerics of Kossuth persuaded the Firelord to intervene, and he sent his own fire elementals to drive the salamanders out.

==Realms==
* [[Kossuth]], the Lord of Flames, the Firelord, Tyrant among Fire Elementals, the Fire Tyrant, once had a palace made of elemental fire here, called the [[Crimson Pillar]]. After the [[Spellplague]], it was revealed that he was a [[primordial]] and he created a new realm in the Elemental Chaos called the [[Undying Pyre]].
* [[Amaimon]], King of the Azer, had no specific palace but traveled with his court from tower to tower (the azer were marvelous metalworkers and built grand towers scattered about the plane), holding feasts and fetes with dancing.
* [[Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan]], Sultan of the Efreet, the Lord of the Flame, the Potentate Incandescent, the Tempering and Eternal Flame of Truth, the Smoldering Dictator, and other titles, lived in his Charcoal Palace in the City of Brass.
* [[Imix]], the Prince of Evil Fire Creatures, once dwelled in a tremendous active volcano on this plane.

==Connections==
There were several permanent connections to the Plane of Fire on [[Toril]] in the Material Plane.

In his lair beneath [[Zhentil Keep]], the [[banelich]] [[Stallac Benadi]] constructed an open, one-way ''[[gate]]'' to the Elemental Plane of Fire. It was used for disposing of mining rubble and incinerating unused corpses.

In the lair of the [[black dragon]] [[Harondalbar]] in the [[Sunset Mountains]], [[Faren Starlight]] created a furnace that vented magically to the Plane of Fire. This was used for cooking, heating, and magical experimentation.

Across the [[River Agis]] from the city of [[Memnon (city)|Memnon]] laid the ruins of the ancient [[efreeti]] city of [[Memnonnar]]. Deep beneath these ruins was the [[Great Brass Gate]], a vertical ring of solid brass  about 100 ft (30 m) in diameter, that formed a two-way ''portal'' to the Fire Plane. Seepage from this portal filled nearby passages with toxic smoke and heated the surrounding ruins to such a degree that some of the walls glowed.
