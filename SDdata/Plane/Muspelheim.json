        "mainbody": "Muspelheim was the second layer of Ysgard. A jagged land of fire and volcanic rock, it was named after the divine realm of Surtr that existed within its lands.\nMuspelheim was formed by similar earthbergs to those that constituted the first layer, Ysgard, but they were inverted with respect to those. In Muspelheim, the fire-lit side faced up, so most of the terrain in the entire layer was dominated by fire and was quite inhospitable to visitors. In many ways, it was very similar to some regions of the Elemental Plane of Fire, which was connected to the layer via numerous portals.\n* Muspelheim, realm of Surtr. It contained some of the few arable lands of the entire layer, which were used to grow fireweed, verdobba, and a type of edible black wood.\nSince it was such a desolate place, Muspelheim was generally avoided. Only its native fire giants remained to care for the land and were its undisputed rulers."
