        "Geography": {
            "45th layer": "The 45th layer appeared as a windswept steppe with a continual gray sky. All sounds were muted and faded into the background noise, even the most terrible screams. The landscape was remarkably unremarkable—details bled together until it was nearly impossible to tell where one was going or where one had been and travelers rarely remembered anything of the lands and towns they had visited during their journeys, though people, creatures, and objects could be remembered as normal. The 45th layer was also home to the [[Zrintor|Viper Forest of Zrintor]].",
            "46th layer": "The 46th layer shone with its own luminosity, projecting light and shadows upwards into the sky—the sky itself was dark and turned gray at night.",
            "47th layer": "The 47th layer glowed under the light of a blue sun. Heat and cold had an unusual relationship on this plane and often acted opposite to what was expected. Fire burned blue and purple and cold magic instead became hot. The [[tanar'ri]] here were hurt by fire but became immune to cold. The blue light of the sun made it difficult to discern the features of an individual and so it was frequently used by visitors to help disguise themselves."
        },
        "Government": "Grazz't held absolute power in all three layers of Azzagrat. Any fiend who did not bend to his mercurial will was likely to be tortured to death in the bowels of the [[Argent Palace]].",
        "Trade": "Azzagrat was probably the Abyssal layer that was most friendly to merchants. The plane particularly attracted visitors looking for magical secrets and perverse forms of entertainment. Those who intended to do harm to merchants within Azzagrat were reprimanded or eaten.\n\nHowever, upon leaving the Triple Realm, a merchant was expected to offer a large portion of their profits to the guardian of the ''[[portal]]'' they used to exit.",
