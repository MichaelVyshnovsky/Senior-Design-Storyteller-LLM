Jotunheim (meaning Gianthome in the Giant language) was the Neutral Outer Plane of the World Tree cosmology that served as the final resting place of giants and the location of the realms of the giant pantheon.
In the Great Wheel cosmology it was the divine realm only of the gods of the frost and fire giants, Thrym and Surtr, respectively. It was located on Ysgards first layer.
Usually, Jotunheim bordered the realms of Asgard and Vanaheim. The Iving River, the largest river in all of Asgard, served as the border between it and Jotunheim. The realm of Muspelheim was situated behind a barrier of continually active volcanoes.
This plane consisted of a glaciers, volcanoes, snow-capped mountains, and desolate plains. Much of the landscape was dotted with menhirs and forests of towering pine and oak trees. Some described the vegetation on this plain as sickly, such as yellowing mistletoe and scraggly weeds.
* Gudheim, the crystal palace of Annam All-Father before he departed to the Hidden Realm in the Outlands in his exile.
* Fimbulwinter, sometimes known as Jotunheim, was the domain of the giant god Thrym in the World Tree cosmology. Some claimed he maintained no permanent palace in the realm, 
* Florallium, the domain of the giant goddess Iallanis. It was large, peaceful palace full of gardens and crystal springs. It was an unspoken rule that the domain was a neutral territory for Jotunheims deities and petitioners, a place where peaces could be negotiated.
* Meerrauk, an enormous underground city. In the Great Wheel cosmology, Surtur was said to reside within it.
* Okalnir, a beer-hall ran by a frost giant named Brimir. It was typically very active in the summer time, but quite deserted during winter.
* River Iving, a river that connected the planes of Jotunheim with Asgard. A clan of mountain giants ran a ferry that transported travelers along it.
* Shatterstone, the domain of the ogre god Vaprak. It was a pitiful cave at the base of a great cliff.
* The Steading, the domain of the giant god Grolantor. A large wooden house that stood on the foothills of one of Jotunheims many mountains.
* Stormhold, the domain of the giant god Stronmaus. A massive white cloud, atop which stood a palace made of various precious metals and gems, that roamed across Jotunheim bringing rain and light storms.
* Thraotor, the domain of the giant god Memnor. A massive thunderhead cloud, atop which stood a palace of adamantine, that roamed across Jotunheim spreading violent storms in its wake.
* Utgard, a major city and fortress that was guarded by various illusions and camouflage. It was ruled by a giant king named Utgard-Loki.
* Well of Mimir, a legendary magical well that was situated close to one of Yggdrasils roots.
* Woodhaven, the domain of the giant goddess Hiatea. It was a large collection of great longhouses within the heart of a massive oak forest.
The giants who inhabited Jotunheim were noted as being somewhat smarter than their relatives on the Material Plane and they were said to possess giant-sized magical items with the power to affect a deity.
One could also find fensir, Ysgardian dwarves, and gnomes within this realm. Though the latter two were detested by the resident giants. The dwarves often brought wares from their home layer of Nidavellir and charged double what they normally would.
Notable animals within this realm included rocs and winter wolves that were the size of elephants, as well as bulettes that were referred to by the local giants as "land dragons".
