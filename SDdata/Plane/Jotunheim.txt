'''Jotunheim''' (meaning '''Gianthome''' in the [[Giant language]]) was the [[Neutral Planes|Neutral]] [[Outer Planes|Outer Plane]] of the [[World Tree cosmology]] that served as the final resting place of [[giant]]s and the location of the realms of the [[giant pantheon]].

In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] it was the [[divine realm]] only of the gods of the [[Frost giant|frost]] and [[fire giant]]s, [[Thrym]] and [[Surtr]], respectively. It was located on [[Ysgard]]'s [[Ysgard (layer)|first layer]].

==Description==
===Cosmography===
Usually, Jotunheim bordered the realms of [[Asgard]] and [[Vanaheim]]. The Iving River, the largest river in all of Asgard, served as the border between it and Jotunheim.{{Cite dragon/90/Plane Facts on Gladsheim|37}} The realm of [[Muspelheim]] was situated behind a barrier of continually active volcanoes.

===Geography===
This plane consisted of a glaciers, volcanoes, snow-capped mountains, and desolate plains. Much of the landscape was dotted with [[menhir]]s and forests of towering [[pine]] and [[oak]] trees. Some described the vegetation on this plain as sickly, such as yellowing [[mistletoe]] and scraggly weeds.

==Notable Locations==
* '''[[Gudheim]]''', the crystal palace of [[Annam All-Father]] before he departed to the [[Hidden Realm]] in the [[Outlands]] in his exile.
* '''Fimbulwinter''', sometimes known as Jotunheim, was the domain of the giant god [[Thrym]] in the World Tree cosmology. Some claimed he maintained no permanent palace in the realm, 
* '''Florallium''', the domain of the giant goddess [[Iallanis]]. It was large, peaceful palace full of gardens and crystal springs. It was an unspoken rule that the domain was a neutral territory for Jotunheim's deities and [[petitioners]], a place where peaces could be negotiated.
* '''[[Meerrauk]]''', an enormous underground city. In the Great Wheel cosmology, Surtur was said to reside within it.
* '''[[Okalnir]]''', a beer-hall ran by a frost giant named [[Brimir]]. It was typically very active in the summer time, but quite deserted during winter.
* '''River Iving''', a river that connected the planes of Jotunheim with Asgard. A clan of [[mountain giant]]s ran a ferry that transported travelers along it.
* '''[[Shatterstone]]''', the domain of the [[ogre]] god [[Vaprak]]. It was a pitiful cave at the base of a great cliff.
* '''The [[Steading]]''', the domain of the giant god [[Grolantor]]. A large wooden house that stood on the foothills of one of Jotunheim's many mountains.
* '''Stormhold''', the domain of the giant god [[Stronmaus]]. A massive white cloud, atop which stood a palace made of various precious metals and gems, that roamed across Jotunheim bringing rain and light storms.
* '''[[Thraotor]]''', the domain of the giant god [[Memnor]]. A massive thunderhead cloud, atop which stood a palace of [[adamantine]], that roamed across Jotunheim spreading violent storms in its wake.
* '''[[Utgard]]''', a major city and fortress that was guarded by various illusions and camouflage. It was ruled by a giant king named [[Utgard-Loki]].
* '''[[Well of Mimir]]''', a legendary magical well that was situated close to one of [[Yggdrasil]]'s roots.
* '''Woodhaven''', the domain of the giant goddess [[Hiatea]]. It was a large collection of great longhouses within the heart of a massive oak forest.

==Inhabitants==
The giants who inhabited Jotunheim were noted as being somewhat smarter than their relatives on the [[Material Plane]] and they were said to possess giant-sized [[Magical item|magical items]] with the power to affect a [[deity]].

One could also find [[fensir]], [[Ysgardian dwarves]], and [[gnomes]] within this realm. Though the latter two were detested by the resident giants. The dwarves often brought wares from their home layer of [[Nidavellir]] and charged double what they normally would.

Notable animals within this realm included [[roc]]s and [[winter wolves]] that were the size of [[elephant]]s, as well as [[bulette]]s that were referred to by the local giants as "land dragons".<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|17-18}}
