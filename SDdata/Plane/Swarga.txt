Swarga was a loosely defined realm that spanned two of the equally loosely defined layers of Limbo. It was the shared divine realm of the deities Agni, Indra, and Vayu of the Lords of Creation.
The realm was characterized by swirling matter and energy without pattern, strong winds and flames, and raging storms that struck at random.
* Agnis palace was mainly located in the Agni layer. It was a great sphere filled with flames fueled by the raw energy of the plane. Anyone entering the sphere without Agnis express protection was instantly immolated.
* Indras realm was also a great sphere, located primarily in the Indra layer. It was made of marble and decorated with carvings of the deity, and surrounded by constant rain. The interior of the sphere was filled halfway with milk. At the center of this enchanted sea, a turtle-shaped island floated, atop which Indras palace stood.
* Vayus realm was a cloud palace surrounded by winds of random intensity. It could only be accessed with the help of Vayus asuras servants.
All three realms constantly moved and frequently shifted between layers, so that their exact location was impossible to predict.
Swarga was generally avoided by the githzerai anarchs and other creatures who normally shaped Limbo, since shaping the divine realm to a mortals will risked attracting the wrath of the destructive deities.
