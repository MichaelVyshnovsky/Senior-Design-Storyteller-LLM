'''Swarga''' was a loosely defined realm that spanned two of the equally loosely defined layers of [[Limbo]]. It was the shared [[divine realm]] of the [[deities]] [[Agni]], [[Indra (deity)|Indra]], and [[Vayu]] of the [[Lords of Creation]].

==Description==
The realm was characterized by swirling matter and energy without pattern, strong winds and flames, and raging storms that struck at random.

==Notable Locations==
* Agni's palace was mainly located in the [[Agni (layer)|Agni layer]]. It was a great sphere filled with flames fueled by the raw energy of the plane. Anyone entering the sphere without Agni's express protection was instantly immolated.
* Indra's realm was also a great sphere, located primarily in the [[Indra (layer)|Indra layer]]. It was made of [[marble]] and decorated with carvings of the deity, and surrounded by constant rain. The interior of the sphere was filled halfway with [[milk]]. At the center of this enchanted sea, a turtle-shaped island floated, atop which Indra's palace stood.
* Vayu's realm was a cloud palace surrounded by winds of random intensity. It could only be accessed with the help of Vayu's [[asuras]] servants.

All three realms constantly moved and frequently shifted between layers, so that their exact location was impossible to predict.

==Inhabitants==
Swarga was generally avoided by the [[githzerai]] anarchs and other creatures who normally shaped Limbo, since shaping the divine realm to a mortal's will risked attracting the wrath of the destructive deities.
