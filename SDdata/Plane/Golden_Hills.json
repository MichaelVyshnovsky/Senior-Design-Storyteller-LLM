        "Inhabitants": "The only native inhabitants of this plane were the [[deva]]s, [[solar]]s, [[planetar]]s, and other [[angel]]s that served the local gods. Gnome and [[svirfneblin]] petitioners made up the rest of the population.",
        "Realms": "[[File:MithralForge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of Mithral Forge]]\n* [[Baervan Wildwanderer]]'s realm was known as [[Whisperleaf]]. The name was taken from the huge oak tree atop the hill, from which Baervan cut his [[halfspear]] of the same name. It was said that the tree was actually a [[treant]] of the largest size and would attack anyone who approached it other than Baervan.{{Cite dragon/61/Gods of the Gnomes|32}} A quaint and cozy cottage was near the tree, which, despite its small appearance, was large enough to hold all his petitioners.\n* [[Baravar Cloakshadow]]'s realm was known as the [[Hidden Knoll]]. The Sly One set all manner of non-lethal traps, illusions, and misdirections at the entrance to his domain. It was said that anyone who got past them could have their pick of the treasures in his realm. It was also said that he changed the defenses constantly to embarrass the overconfident and ensure only the truly skilled would triumph. Petitioners lived in small [[thorp]]s strewn about the hill and beneath the surface.\n* [[Callarduran Smoothhands]]' realm was known as [[the Deep]] This hill was the smallest of the seven, but the vast majority of this realm was underground. [[Svirfneblin]] petitioners had an affinity for this realm, even those that did not consider Callarduran to be their patron deity.In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Deephome was not one of the seven Golden Hills, but was located nearby. The seventh Hill was the Workshop, realm of the gnomish inventor god [[Nebelun]], who was not active within the Realms.<br/>Also, Callarduran Smoothhands ''was'' considered the partron of the svirfneblin in the Great Wheel cosmology.<br/> It was said that despite the dense depths there were caverns of breathtaking beauty to be seen.\n* [[Flandal Steelskin]]'s realm was known as the [[Mithral Forge]]. Almost entirely underground, a large petitioner's city sat atop a complex of mines, tunnels, and a forge heated by [[Elemental Plane of Earth|elemental fire]]. The hill reverberated with every blow of Flandal's hammer. It was rumored to contain a subterranean river of liquid [[mithral]].\n* [[Gaerdal Ironhand]]'s realm was known as [[Stronghaven]]. Heavily fortified, this hill contained a citadel that was the bulwark of defense for the rest of the plane. Gaerdal took security and protection very seriously and this realm was characterized by a utilitarian design and a distinct lack of the usual tricks, jokes, and shenanigans that were found in abundance on most of the other hills.\n* [[Garl Glittergold]]'s realm was known as [[Glitterhome]]. The largest of the Golden Hills belonged to the patriarch of the pantheon, but he didn't spend much of his time in residence. He preferred to wander about the plane, often in disguise, playing practical jokes, encouraging unity and cooperation, and watching over his people.\n* [[Segojan Earthcaller]]'s realm was known as the [[Gemstone Burrow]]. Another realm that was mostly subterranean, the Earthfriend filled his domain with burrowing animals, and together with his petitioners they riddled this hill with earthen tunnels of all sizes that joined pleasant lairs and comfortable homes."
