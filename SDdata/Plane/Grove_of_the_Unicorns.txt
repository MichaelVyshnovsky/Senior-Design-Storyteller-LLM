The Grove of the Unicorns was the divine realm of the Faerûnian goddess Mielikki.
It appeared to be only a simple grove of trees found within a larger forest, but it was much bigger on the inside than on the outside. If an explorer could be counted as a friend to nature, they might spot a unicorn drinking from a pool in the heart of the grove, whereupon the entirety of the lush realm would appear around them. But one who was unworthy would not see the unicorn and could wander in and out and never know the realm was there.
According to the animal petitioners, there were odd settlements hidden within the Grove, but there were a mystery to outsiders.
In the Great Wheel cosmology, the Grove of the Unicorns could be found in Krigala, the day-lit first layer of the Beastlands.
In the World Tree cosmology, the realm was located in the House of Nature. Shiallias realm, the High Glade, bordered on the Grove.
As the name suggested, the Grove was a wood where many unicorns and celestial chargers could be encountered.
Most importantly, it was home to the goddess Mielikki, the Mistress of the Forest, though she shared it with the Oerth deity [https//greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Ehlonna Ehlonna].
Mielikki established the Grove of the Unicorns with the power she gained from reforming her clergy in the . Before that, she had always dwelt on the Prime Material Plane.
