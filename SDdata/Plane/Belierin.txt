'''Belierin''', sometimes called the '''Forgotten Layer''', was the third and least known layer of [[Elysium]]. An endless land of swamps and marshes covered by an eerily luminous mist, it was also rumored to be the prison of an ancient legendary [[hydra]] and possibly other powerful entities.
{{quote|No, berk, you don't get it [snort]. You do not want to go [snort] and see just what Belierin is really like. It's a bloomin' swamp; end of story. [whicker, snort] Get it?|The equinal Bay to a traveler in Elysium<ref>}}

==Geography==
The River [[Oceanus]] flowed slowly through Belierin in a tangle of channels that braided around sandbars and [[mangrove]] forests. In some places, rocky ridges rose above the bog, making for stable terrain. A few communities and towns were located in those places, usually built around lighthouses that served as navigation beacons to aid travelers.

===Geographical Features===
Despite the generally desolate nature of the layer, the [[good]] influence of Elysium could still be felt in Belierin, in the form of the shiny nature of the fog itself and a luminous vapor that surrounded every light source.

==History==
In ancient times, the [[guardinal]]s encountered a legendary hydra in one of their quests, thought to be the mythical unique individual that spawned all other hydras. Unable to defeat it, the guardinals used a ''[[teleport]]'' spell to move the hydra to Belierin, after which they closed all portals that led out of the layer and sealed it off from [[divination]] magic. This effectively turned the layer into an infinite cage, from which the only exit was the Oceanus itself, whose blessed waters the hydra could not touch.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that other powerful entities shared the prison with the hydra. The number and nature of the other prisoners was not known, but rumors existed of a creature similar to the [[tarrasque]], a legendary [[black dragon]], a captured [[archdevil]], a [[demon lord]], an [[archomental]], or even a wounded [[deity]].

==Notable Locations==
[[File:Nillis-Thur.png|thumb|right|280px|''The ancient [[aasimon]] fortress of [[Nillis-Thur]], in the region known as the [[Quesar's Birthplace]], now guarded by [[guardinal]]s.'']]
* [[Nillis-thur]], hidden [[aasimon]] fortress of old.
* [[Quesar's Birthplace]], where the mysterious [[celestial]]s named [[quesar]]s were originally formed.
* [[Refuge of Night]], realm of [[Nut]], wife of [[Geb]] and mother of [[Osiris]] from the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], after she fled from [[Heliopolis]].
* [[Rubicon]], the last surviving guardinal outpost of the layer, located on an island in the middle of Oceanus near the point where the river flowed into [[Eronia]].
