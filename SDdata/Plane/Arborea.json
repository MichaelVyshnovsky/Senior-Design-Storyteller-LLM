The entrance was hidden in a magic mirror, and the few who could find their own way out were supposedly vain forever.",
        "Arvandor is the only civilized wilderness.\n|[[Elmoriel]] the Enchantress\n}}\nArvandor was less pastoral than Olympus, a realm of deep woods with ancient trees and cathedral-like groves of towering green. Canopies were sometimes divided into multiple layers, with sun-loving trees at the top and shade-loving vines and scrub trees closer to the earth. The upper layers were inhabited by giant [[squirrel]]s and [[bat]]s, [[aarakocra]], and a few elven tribes that avoided the ground, believing it to be unclean or unlucky. \n\nThe undergrowth and rotting trunks of fallen trees could make certain sections almost completely impassible, and completely hide the ground floor, and creatures of darkness, including [[spider]]s, [[ettercap]]s, and [[shadow]]s, lurked within the dense foliage. Contrasting these darker areas were the beams of sunlight in Arvanor's meadows, where babbling brooks were common. Crashing giants opened up clearings that flowered all-year around, sporting bluish snowblossoms in winter that heralded spring. \n\n[[File:Arvandor.png|right|thumb|400px|A map of Arvandor.]]\nThough praised as a land of untouched by civilization, the High Forest was a tame wilderness. There were almost no villages because the residents lived with nature rather than apart from it, living in favored glades, groves and treetowns that were more a part of the land than urban centers. Similarly, some would say Arvandor, with its unearthly beauty and wild passion, exemplified all of Arborea, but the elves had colored their realm more than the plane had colored them. Non-elves that entered Arvandor were at risk of losing themselves to the beauty of the place, compelling them to seek out elves to dance, sing, and indulge with, (though the elves there normally acted this way regardless) requiring others to guide and lead them.\n\nThe elvish pantheon were similar to the Greeks in outlook but even more chaotic and more goodly, showing less organization and regimentation{{Cite dragon/155/The Elfin Gods|20}}\n\nNot taking much interest in the governance of Arvandor, the Seldarine delegated rulership to proxies and emissaries, with the High Kings and Queens of Arborea ruling entire races of elves. They lacked the mighty fortresses of the Olympians, but nonetheless ruled Arvandor with an artistic hand. Their ornate homes could be huge cathedrals grown from living plants, wondrous palaces of gems and stones, or simply small shrines or circles of natural stones in the middle of their domains.\n\n* [[Aerdrie Faenya]]: The Winged Mother, Aerdrie was the Seldarine goddess of air and avians, and shared her domain with the aarakocra goddess [[Syranita]]. The [[Aerie (realm)|Aerie]], as it was known, consisted of clouds and floating islands, and she usually kept it calm despite delighting in changing its weather. The Aerie philosophically bordered Arvandor and [[Alfheim]], and Aerdrie often left to wander the winds of both accompanied by several birds.\n\n* [[Araleth Letheranil]]: Known as the Prince of Stars, Araleth was the Seldarine god of light and stellar bodies, one dedicated to the endless war against the  shadowy powers of the [[Dark Seldarine]]. His dwelling in Arvandor was known as the [[House of Glowing Stars]], and was constantly beset by the drifting luminaries.{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited|13-14}}\n\n* [[Araushnee]]: Formerly known as the Weaver of Destiny, Araushnee was the original name of Lolth when she was the Seldarine goddess of art and fate. [[Lolth's Grove|Her realm]] was once an autumn grove of trees with silver-stems, with a spring at the center that saw great merriment and reflection. After her betrayal and rebellion, it was reduced to a series of dead trees with a sludge pool at the center, haunted by giant spiders and [[banshee]]s.\n\n* [[Corellon Larethian]]: Coronal of Arvandor, Correlon was the Seldarine's leader and primary elf deity. His home was Gwyllachaightaeryll (meaning The Many-Splendored and often called so), a magnificent tower of white marble and golden spires in the heart of Arvandor. The castle rose in and through the trees, smaller towers spinning off in patterns of whimsical confusion, and all rooms but the throne room constantly changed places.\n\n* [[Deep Sashelas]]: Lord of the Undersea, Sashelas was the Seldarine god of knowledge, creation, and the ocean. Depending on his mood, his realm of Elavandor laid either in the Sparkling Sea on Arvandor's edge, or somewhere in Aquallor, with many gates between the two existing in his domain. His coral, gold, and marble palace was surrounded by glowing, crystal blue water, and sat at the floor of a deep sea chasm.\n\n* [[Erevan Ilesere]]: Called The Trickster, Erevan was the Seldarine god of mischief and change. His resting place in Arvandor, built next to the Gnarl, was a sprawling palace made of whatever material suited him and that always changed when one returned to it. Visitors were invited to test their wits and skills there, against every trap that ever amused or confused the Trickster, and even to try and steal the treasures from its shifting halls.\n\n* [[Fenmarel Mestarine]]: Known as the Lone Wolf, Fenmarel was the Seldarine god of solitude and outcasts. Normally he resided in his realm of [[Fennimar]] in Limbo, but despite his voluntary removal, he still had a home in Arvandor when he decided to stay there. Only Sehanine Moonbow's kindness drew him back to Arvandor on rare occassions.\n\n* [[Hanali Celanil]]: Known as the Heart of Gold, Hanali was the Seldarine goddess of love and beauty, and an intense, but friendly, rival of Sune. Her splendorous crystal palace in Arvandor was so well-made that a single candle, if properly placed or slightly readjusted, could brighten or darken the entire structure. One couldn't look inside from the outside, but from within it was like looking through exceptionally clear glass.\n\n* [[Kirith Sotheril]]: Known as The Magess, Kirith was the Seldarine goddess of magic, specifically the subtler schools of enchantment and divination, and she resided in the realm of [[Tethridar]] with her lover [[Tethrin Veraldé]]. It was a small, pleasant domain with an open field, a large copse of trees, and a fruit orchard.{{Cite dragon/155/The Elfin Gods|14,17}}<ref group": "\"note\" name=\"note1\">[[Kirith Sotheril]] and [[Tethrin Veraldé]] are placed into Arvandor by [[Dragon magazine 155]] and it is implied the whole Seldarine lives in Arborea by ''[[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]''.  [[Dragon magazine 236]] places them into [[Elysium]] instead, but is the only source that names their realm. This article assumes that their realm in Arvandor also has this name.",
        "mainbody": "Arborea was a plane of secrets and enigmas, from the unpredictable path of the Evergold, to what entities and secrets once and still resided in the sands of Pelion. The elven domain of Arvandor was the region of Arborea best known to Material Plane visitors, and it too was a mystery, even to the elves themselves. Beyond that domain were even more hidden matters, perhaps realms ruled by deities unknown. It was said that only the gods knew the secrets of the Olympian Glades, and even then the more adventurous deities could still be stumped by its greater mysteries.",
        "Description": {
            "Geography": "Compared to its depraved counterpart in the [[Abyss]], which had, if not literally then effectively, an infinite number of foul layers, Arborea could seem small since it possessed only three. However, while the Abyss was a chaotic cluster of miniature realms, its individual, warring worlds each horrific and harsh in their own unique ways, the comparative cohesiveness of Arborea's layers was not to be mistaken for a lack of diversity.\n\nIn truth, Arborea was a fantastically patchwork plane, a crazy quilt of thriving climates and environments with endless abundance.\n\nHowever, in the hinterlands between settlements, Arborea's wilderness could be almost impassable, increasing in hostility the deeper in one went and not just because of prowling predators. Normally even the Arborean winter was mild, but the weather of the plane was as whimsical and unpredictable as the inhabitants. The plane lacked the serenity of its [[lawful]] counterpart [[Mount Celestia]], its pleasant breezes turning to violent storms in an instant and death on the plane coming mostly from lightning and hail. Still, one normally had to go looking for trouble in Arborea to find it, and even the weather at its most extreme didn't soil the overpowering and bewildering beauty of the plane.\n\nArborea's larger than life aspect was both figurative and literal, the big emotions reflecting the big plane. The sheer extravagant size of everything simply couldn't be understated: every craggy mountain was stupendous, every ravine unbelievably deep, every lush forest filled with monstrously huge trees, every ocean unimaginably deep, every river mighty, and every plain a wild stretch. Never doing small, Arborea's immensity made it difficult to traverse due to steepness and distance. Realms aside from those of common knowledge potentially laid hidden, ruled over by unknown beings.",
            "Layers": "{{/Imagemap}}\nArborea's three layers each had unique landscapes, the first being the most well-known and the others being difficult to get to, with most travelers not bothering to."

        "Cosmography": {
            "Inner Portals": "In contrast to the many ways in and out of Arborea itself, portals ''between'' layers were rarer on the Olympian Glades than they were on other Outer Plane. Such portals took the form of spinning crimson disks, but [[divination]] magic was required to determine where they would deposit a traveler. The gods of Olympus located and identified all permanent portals within a few thousand leagues of their realms in all directions, and such places were guarded by them and [[petitioner]]s and sometimes with stone walls and iron gates.\n\nThis tight control wasn't so much to stop travelers as it was to slow the curious and prevent dangerous and/or stupid creatures from wandering where they didn't belong. Neither the Olympian nor Elvish pantheons particularly cared about extraplanar viewing points in their realms, but particularly irritating ones (such as those that stayed in one place too long as if someone was planning to break in), were [[dispel magic|dispelled]] and the caster brought in and lectured.\n\nPortals to Aquallor in other areas of Arborea often went to the watery domain of [[Deep Sashelas]] of the elven pantheon or the undersea realm of [[Poseidon]]. Undersea gateways were often guarded by elven petitioners while the gateways on islands were watched by Greek petitioners."
        },
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Celestials": "[[Celestials]] were common in Arborea, [[Agathia]], [[deva]]s, [[planetar]]s, [[solar]]s, [[hollyphant]]s, and [[foo creature]]s formed the usual cohort of creatures ubiquitous to the [[Upper planes]], Many [[lillend]]i thrived on the emotions rippling through the plane,\n\nThe most common celestials in Arborea were the [[eladrin]]s, The best known and most commonly encountered breeds were the [[ghaele]]s, that were often found hunting through the wilderness.",
            "Monsters": "[[File:Arborea Pegasus AFR.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Pegasi]] were found in Arborea.]]\nSome of the most common creatures in Arborea were monsters from the legends of its most famous pantheons. [[Chimera]]e, [[gorgon]]s, [[harpies]], [[medusa]]e, [[sphinx]]es, and [[pegasi]] all made nests or lairs in the mountainous terrain, or lived and lurked in the wilderness of the first layer. [[Fey]] spirits lurked everywhere, easily provoked and utterly unpredictable compared even to those who would draw blood at the smallest insult.\n\n[[Titan]]s dwelt and roamed in the hinterlands of the infinite plane, some rebellious and still bitter over past grudges, and some (in a few cases) completely oblivious to the fact that many of their kin had been imprisoned in [[Carceri]]. [[Giant]]s (including giant-kin like [[cyclops]]es) also wandered the plane looking to challenge those seeking adventure, sometimes including various deities. Both the titans and giant gods made use of agents and proxies to torment and spy on their ancient enemies. The wilderness and size of Arborea, for both them and others, presented many hiding places and opportunities for vengeance.\n\nArborea's fauna was just as bountiful and abundant as its flora, and its game was both plentiful and trusting. Massive, wild [[cattle]] roamed free, However, the great size didn't stop at the prey, for Arvandor was also the home of great beasts, including giant [[bear]]s, [[boar]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[lion]]s, [[serpent]]s, and [[wolves]]. Even beneath the trees, great fireflies arranged themselves in ever-shifting constellations at night.\n\nThough fell beasts stalked the plane and hungry predators would make easy prey out of injured travelers, the giant animals of Arborea were no more aggressive than usual varieties, and they typically left groups of mortals or [[petitioner]]s alone. [[Celestial creature|Celestial]] and [[anarchic creature|anarchic]] monsters and animals were present there, the former fighting with relish only if disturbed and the latter being predictably unpredictable. In general, the creatures of Arborea were bigger, tougher, had more powerful bearing and demeanor, and, in the case of humanoid monsters, had a 5% chance of possessing incredible magical powers. However, those qualities were reduced when Arborean native creatures entered other planes.",
            "Petitioners": "The petitioners of Arborea were as diverse as the trees to be found in a forest. Most were the elves of Arvandor or the humans of Olympus, but almost all sylvan races, including [[gnome]]s, [[centaur]]s, [[satyr]]s, [[nixie]]s, and [[harpies]], could be found there. Petitioners of Arborea were hearty folk, quick to react with personal vice and/or virtuous deed. They grinned wide, slapped backs, and sang epics when happy while excessively drinking and wailing like [[banshee]]s when saddened. Though ready to fight without hesitation if angered, conflict in Arborea wasn't so much a matter of battle as it was brawl, since despite the violence, death was seldom the result. Never dull, with constant, swashbuckling bravado, the Arboreans always had hunts, fights, contests of strength, tests of bravery, and long, loud parties.\n\nThese were effectively the plane's commoners, and they tended to the woodlands and meadows of Arborea with the same care and diligence of a peasant anywhere else. Just because Arborea was lush didn't mean they didn't farm, for grain and hay was needed for livestock and the best and biggest bounty was more easily grown than gathered. The inhabitants liked to claim credit for Arborea's bounty; merchants went through the [[Outlands]] gate-town of [[Sylvania]] to bring various foods and stranger ingredients like ram's blood, fermented fish, and wine of oak sap to [[Sigil]]. Many ancient groves still needed care, and arsonists, woodcutters, sport-hunters, and even those who cut a path through untouched wilderness, could often find themselves suffering from lethal attacks by the protectors of the ancient wilds.\n\nNot all of the elven dead incarnated as elves again when they reached Arborea. Some, as happened to most petitioners at the end of their \"lives\" infused the plane itself, while others reformed into celestial or anarchic creatures. Worthy souls were rewarded by [[Corellon]] with elven form, and were known as the \"Chosen of Arvandor\". Within the canopied clearings where they made their settlements, the Chosen engaged in an idyllic elven life. Hunts and challenges, trysts and celebrations, feasts and tales around the fire, and other wondrous pastimes filled the afterlives of such elves.  In a single day there, lifelong friends could laugh over a meal before fighting over a mutual lover, then end the evening celebrating each other's bravery and integrity. There was also service in Corellon's oak-lined halls, duty as scouts, wardens, and servitors in the magic glades and magnificent castles of the Seladrine. \n\nThe souls of elves in Arborea were similar to those elsewhere, differing only in the intensity of their emotions. In Arborea, their passions ran unrestricted, joy, love, and contentment on spectacular display in their myriad extremes as much as rage, lust, and jealousy. They expressed their elation and sadness by pouring it into heart-achingly beautiful music, and their rage with cold, hard vengeance.  In the day, the splendor of the Seladrine illuminated the lives of the elves there, and their elven trances were intoxicating blissful due to their closeness to Corellon. Elves of all kinds could be found in Arborea, including seasonal [[fey eladrin]], [[sea elves]] dwelling in Aquallor, Elves born on Arborea were [[celestial creature]]s, wild at heart and ready to fight evil in an instant, but the plane could be dangerous for mortal elves not born there. Their boisterous and mercurial native kin might wish to fight over the slightest lapse in tradition or ill remark.\n\nUnique to Arborea were the petitioners known as the [[bacchae]], the spirits of gluttons and gourmands, well-intentioned drunks, and those that otherwise relished living. Somewhere between man and animal, the satyr-like creatures were equal parts chaotic and good, for they lived in the moment and strove to make that moment the best. Almost anything could provoke their ire, but they were generally nonviolent, more likely to offer bread and drink to an attacker if not simply flee, and they might suddenly stop a fight out of genuine appreciation of the opposition's skills (or to get a second-wind). If an outsider enjoyed their company and were accepted in turn, whether petitioner or planar traveler, they would be at risk of turning into a bacchae as well.",
            "Powers": "If the petitioners of Arborea were its commoners, then the nature spirits were the rulers. Dryads were ruling protectors of whole oak forests and woods, and sylphs were the masters of the heights. The spirits required sacrifices in the many sacred groves, ancient caverns, and other natural landmarks of prophecy and judgement. Small shrines forewarned of nearby spirits; failing to appease them was to invite bad luck, and to not just ignore, but outright mock them, was sure to bring a price.\n\nThe feuding gods of Arborea were not ashamed to use their followers to settle vendettas, and though some would be flattered by the personal attention, being a pawn in such games could likely result in disappearance or a martyr's death. To avoid the attention of the gods, the Arbroean residents devised many elaborate rituals and tributes to appease and distract them, including libations poured from all cups onto the ground, gifts of gold, perfume, spice and impressive vegetables, and the sacrifice of animals (particularly prized animals) at midsummer and midwinter.\n\nThe hedonistic lack of restraint of the Arboreans was partially due to the fact that even the rituals didn't always keep the powers that were from meddling."

        "Magic": "{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = 300px\n| source = Minorus, keeper of the grove.\n| text   = The gentle slopes of Mount Olympus hide a thousand silent deaths. The sacrifices to the spirits of Arborea have claimed many thousands more.\n}}\n\nUsing magic on Arborea required small sacrifices, ritual offerings to the spirits. Wine, milk, olive oil, oat cakes, gold, well-made idols, untouched animals, or a mage's blood were typical offerings, but each [[school of magic]], and sometimes individual spells, could require specific gifts. Despite the rules on sacrifices, Arborea was relatively benign as far as spell-casting went so long as the nature of the plane was respected, but the backlash of a spell gone wrong could be worse than having not cast one at all.\n\n[[Summon monster]] spells were answered by nature spirits, and trying to summon a creature of the [[lower planes]] would bring down the wrath of the Greek Furies on the transgressors. Summoning spells that called creatures in Arborea typically required a bit of food for the entity summoned, more powerful spells needing carved images, and the greatest requiring one to speak its language. Those that [[conjuration|conjured]] forces rather than creatures could be cast without issue.\n\n''[[Divination]]'' was a respected art across Arborea, but required some external props to perform, such as entrails to read, signs to draw from the stars, or some other form of omen to interpret, and thus took longer than normal depending on the strength of the spell. Divinations often used inanimate offerings like gold, gems, or wine for weaker spells, a living sacrifice (but this could be freeing rather than slaying a creature) for more powerful spells, and required a particularly valuable item from the caster (like a sacred object or magic item) for high-level magic.\n\n[[Enchantment]]s regarding emotions were stronger in Arborea, but could accidentally fill the target with berserker rage that would disperse upon the caster's death or the feeling of pain, after which they typically fled. Enchantment magic required the target's attention to be caught (such as through a joke or riddle, though puns were bad form), for weak spells, the target's name or a group name for middling magic, and an offering of something the subject wanted for higher magic.\n\nBeing a vigorous plane with little patience for disruptions of the natural order, ''[[necromancy]]'' involving death or the [[undead]] typically didn't function, while positive healing spells worked normally. Low-level necromancy needed a few dark gems, more powerful spells a small goblet of life-related liquid like a goblet of blood or sap, and in the highest cases, pure life energy.\n\nExcept in Ossa, that had a strong link to the element of water, elemental magic required a sacrifice to the opposite element proportional to the effect of the spell, for instance a bucket of water for ''[[burning hands]]'' or lighting a small forest fire to balance out a minor flood.",

She dwelt near [[Zeus]]'s domain in a in a palace of mirror-like quartz and gems, all polished so keenly one could see their reflection in the glass, meaning every surface reflected her beauty. The entrance was hidden in a magic mirror, and the few who could find their own way out were supposedly vain forever.\n\n*[[Apollo]]: The Light-Bringer, Apollo was the Greek god of light, prophecy, and poetry, and his temple was also his home, a house of worship with amphitheater in the back. The entire temple was made of beaten gold that always radiated with the sun's mellow glow, while the stage, carved into the southern mountainside, was a semi-circle of white, polished marble, where the finest playwrights were always preparing some drama.\n\n*[[File:Ares.png|thumb|Ares, the Olympian god of war|alt=|127x127px]][[Ares]]: The Jealous and The Unfortunate, Ares was the Greek god of war and killing, ruled by rage and protective of \"his\" sphere (earning him the wrath of [[Maglubiyet]] and [[Gruumsh]]).  His lair was a massive battlement, a dark, gloomy fortress of bloodstained bone near the Portal Defile, the chasm that held the portals to all Prime Material Plane worlds in which the pantheon was worshiped.\n\n* [[Artemis (deity)|Artemis]]: The Huntress, Artemis was the Greek goddess of hunting and beasts and a friend of [[Solonor Thelandira]] of the Seldarine. Hunting only to feed herself or others, Artemis considered all Olympus her home, and had no real personal dwelling. The closest to a realm she had was a small complex of caves to the side of Olympus.\n\n*[[File:Athena.png|thumb|Athena, the Olympian goddess of wisdom|alt=|157x157px]][[Athena]]: The Protectress, Athena was the Greek goddess of war and wisdom, and the antithesis of Ares, a matron of courage rather than carnage venerated for strategy rather than strife. Her realm was on the far, opposite side of the Portal Defile, a bright, shining palace of enduring iron where generals sought wisdom and philosophers the sharp minds of warriors.\n\n*[[Demeter]]: The Fertile Mother, Demeter was the Greek goddess of agriculture, one that had always gotten along with [[Chauntea]] the Earth Mother. Her home was an average cottage surrounded by a vast field of golden grain where her petitioners toiled all day before returning to their own cottages scattered across the lands, working hard yet loving the labor.\n\n* [[File:Dionysus.png|thumb|124x124px|Dionysus, the Olympian god of wine]][[Dionysus]]: The Twice-born, so called for his father Zeus protecting his nascent form when his mother was destroyed, was the Greek god of mirth and madness, a patron of drunkards. His palace of constant, comfortable warmth was in the middle of a vineyard and overrun with vines that, as he decreed, would always be ripe with grape for plucking and juicing. Even if away, bacchae kept the hearth burning and the party going.\n\n* [[Finder Wyvernspur]]: The Nameless Bard, Finder was not an Olympian deity, but a former mortal [[Harper]] that ascended to [[demigod]] status at the end of the [[Godswar]]. A god of changing art forms, he initially chose Olympus as the site for his realm, which he named Fermata, but he later settled in the [[Gates of the Moon]].\n\n* [[File:OlympianHades.png|thumb|128x128px|Hades, the Olympian god of the dead]][[Hades (deity)|Hades]]: Lord of the Dead, Hades was the Greek god of death and wealth and ruler of the [[The Underworld]] in the [[Hades|Gray Wastes]]. He only rarely visited Olympus.\n\n* [[Hecate]]: The Lady of the Night, Hecate maintained a realm in the Gray Wastes and in the [[Nine Hells]]. Though wicked, she was the only Olympian deity of magic, necromancy being her province, and she only allowed such spells to be cast on Olympus (despite not living there) if some fatted black livestock was sacrificed to her and if it was used for evil purposes (despite most denizens and visitors being good).\n\n* [[Hephaestus (deity)|Hephaestus]]: The Lamed, so called for being crippled due to crashing down onto the Material Plane, Hephaetus was the Greek god of smithing and craftsmen, one who the [[gnome|gnomish]] tinkering god [[Nebelun]] occasionally visited to offer help and advice in forging incredible items. His realm of Olympus was in a volcanically active region, he himself working in the very heart of a volcano.\n\n* [[File:Hera.png|thumb|121x121px|Hera, the Olympian goddess of marriage]][[Hera]]: Matron of Heaven, Hera was the Greek goddess of marriage and intrigue, an insanely jealous (but otherwise cordial and friendly) deity. She shared the realm of her husband Zeus, whose constant infidelities frustrated her to no end.\n\n* [[Hermes]]: The Messenger of the Gods, Hermes was the Greek God of travel, trade, and theft, a lovable rogue of the pantheon gentler than most. The entrance to the god of travel's gambling den inside the Mount could lead somewhere unexpected, and the realm was shrouded in darkness to all but his own followers. Though getting pickpocketed was a possibility, no one would dare harm a traveler under Hermes's roof.\n\n* [[File:Nike.png|thumb|120x120px|Nike, the Olympian goddess of victory|alt=]][[Nike]]: Known simply by the title of \"Victory\", Nike was a Greek Goddess that brought her titular phenomenon with her. She had no home of her own in Olympus, maintaining quarters in the palaces of Ares and Athena. Both gods tried to get Nike to ride with them, but she was a fickle goddess that would only accompany either when she so desired.\n\n* [[Pan (Deity)|Pan]]: Called The Satyr, Pan was the Greek god of nature and passion, having fully given over to his desires with complete awareness and intent. He lived on the outer edges of Olympus, making his infrequent visits to the Mount all the more special, and at such times he himself (not an [[avatar]]) played his pipes while wandering the slopes.\n\n* [[Poseidon]]: Known as The Tempest, Poseidon was the Greek god of the waters, and though he maintained a seaside shrine near Olympus, his actual realm, [[Caletto]], was almost entirely under Ossa, and he rarely left. Astoundingly beautiful and usually sunny, the warm waters of his realm could become peaceful or stormy in an instant depending on his mood, for Poseidon was quick to anger but quick to forgive.\n\n* [[Prometheus]]: A rebel titan of supposed omniscience, Prometheus was bound by chains unbreakable until Zeus decided otherwise, tied to a rock within the Olympian realm. Said stone was at the summit of Mount Aetna, a colossal slope filled with howling winds, exotic life, and unearthly majesty, and he was said to share his wisdom with those that fended off the undying vulture who fed on his ever-regenerating liver.\n\n* [[Rhea (Deity)|Rhea]]: Mother of the Gods, Rhea was not actually an Olympian deity but one of the [[greater titan]]s, having created the senior members of the pantheon long ago. Though given a massive palace by the Olympians, she didn't really have her own realm or religion, drawing strength from the entirety of the pantheon.\n\n* [[Tyche]]: Known as Fortune's Smile, Tyche was the [[Netherese pantheon|Netherese]] (formerly Greek) goddess of fortune and fate, begrudgingly forced to flee to Toril to escape her increasing irrelevancy. Her Olympian relam, a former grand villa and gambling hall, had been slowly disappearing, becoming dusty and filled with cobwebs, although that didn't mean her luck still couldn't turn around.\n\n* [[Zeus]]: The Thunderer, Zeus was the leader of the Olympians, his home the most magnificent of all of them. At the summit of Mount Olympus was his grand citadel of polished gold and marble, its halls inlaid with precious gems. Only worshipers of Zeus could see the entrance, and the statues of Zeus and Hera able to animate and dispose of intruders without attracting too much attention (at least compared to the Thunderer).",
            "Arvandor": "{{quote\n|Arvandor is the only civilized wilderness.\n|[[Elmoriel]] the Enchantress\n}}\nArvandor was less pastoral than Olympus, a realm of deep woods with ancient trees and cathedral-like groves of towering green. Canopies were sometimes divided into multiple layers, with sun-loving trees at the top and shade-loving vines and scrub trees closer to the earth. The upper layers were inhabited by giant [[squirrel]]s and [[bat]]s, [[aarakocra]], and a few elven tribes that avoided the ground, believing it to be unclean or unlucky. \n\nThe undergrowth and rotting trunks of fallen trees could make certain sections almost completely impassible, and completely hide the ground floor, and creatures of darkness, including [[spider]]s, [[ettercap]]s, and [[shadow]]s, lurked within the dense foliage. Contrasting these darker areas were the beams of sunlight in Arvanor's meadows, where babbling brooks were common. Crashing giants opened up clearings that flowered all-year around, sporting bluish snowblossoms in winter that heralded spring. \n\n[[File:Arvandor.png|right|thumb|400px|A map of Arvandor.]]\nThough praised as a land of untouched by civilization, the High Forest was a tame wilderness. There were almost no villages because the residents lived with nature rather than apart from it, living in favored glades, groves and treetowns that were more a part of the land than urban centers. Similarly, some would say Arvandor, with its unearthly beauty and wild passion, exemplified all of Arborea, but the elves had colored their realm more than the plane had colored them. Non-elves that entered Arvandor were at risk of losing themselves to the beauty of the place, compelling them to seek out elves to dance, sing, and indulge with, (though the elves there normally acted this way regardless) requiring others to guide and lead them.\n\nThe elvish pantheon were similar to the Greeks in outlook but even more chaotic and more goodly, showing less organization and regimentation{{Cite dragon/155/The Elfin Gods|20}}\n\nNot taking much interest in the governance of Arvandor, the Seldarine delegated rulership to proxies and emissaries, with the High Kings and Queens of Arborea ruling entire races of elves. They lacked the mighty fortresses of the Olympians, but nonetheless ruled Arvandor with an artistic hand. Their ornate homes could be huge cathedrals grown from living plants, wondrous palaces of gems and stones, or simply small shrines or circles of natural stones in the middle of their domains.\n\n* [[Aerdrie Faenya]]: The Winged Mother, Aerdrie was the Seldarine goddess of air and avians, and shared her domain with the aarakocra goddess [[Syranita]]. The [[Aerie (realm)|Aerie]], as it was known, consisted of clouds and floating islands, and she usually kept it calm despite delighting in changing its weather. The Aerie philosophically bordered Arvandor and [[Alfheim]], and Aerdrie often left to wander the winds of both accompanied by several birds.\n\n* [[Araleth Letheranil]]: Known as the Prince of Stars, Araleth was the Seldarine god of light and stellar bodies, one dedicated to the endless war against the  shadowy powers of the [[Dark Seldarine]]. His dwelling in Arvandor was known as the [[House of Glowing Stars]], and was constantly beset by the drifting luminaries.{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited|13-14}}\n\n* [[Araushnee]]: Formerly known as the Weaver of Destiny, Araushnee was the original name of Lolth when she was the Seldarine goddess of art and fate. [[Lolth's Grove|Her realm]] was once an autumn grove of trees with silver-stems, with a spring at the center that saw great merriment and reflection. After her betrayal and rebellion, it was reduced to a series of dead trees with a sludge pool at the center, haunted by giant spiders and [[banshee]]s.\n\n* [[Corellon Larethian]]: Coronal of Arvandor, Correlon was the Seldarine's leader and primary elf deity. His home was Gwyllachaightaeryll (meaning The Many-Splendored and often called so), a magnificent tower of white marble and golden spires in the heart of Arvandor. The castle rose in and through the trees, smaller towers spinning off in patterns of whimsical confusion, and all rooms but the throne room constantly changed places.\n\n* [[Deep Sashelas]]: Lord of the Undersea, Sashelas was the Seldarine god of knowledge, creation, and the ocean. Depending on his mood, his realm of Elavandor laid either in the Sparkling Sea on Arvandor's edge, or somewhere in Aquallor, with many gates between the two existing in his domain. His coral, gold, and marble palace was surrounded by glowing, crystal blue water, and sat at the floor of a deep sea chasm.\n\n* [[Erevan Ilesere]]: Called The Trickster, Erevan was the Seldarine god of mischief and change. His resting place in Arvandor, built next to the Gnarl, was a sprawling palace made of whatever material suited him and that always changed when one returned to it. Visitors were invited to test their wits and skills there, against every trap that ever amused or confused the Trickster, and even to try and steal the treasures from its shifting halls.\n\n* [[Fenmarel Mestarine]]: Known as the Lone Wolf, Fenmarel was the Seldarine god of solitude and outcasts. Normally he resided in his realm of [[Fennimar]] in Limbo, but despite his voluntary removal, he still had a home in Arvandor when he decided to stay there. Only Sehanine Moonbow's kindness drew him back to Arvandor on rare occassions.\n\n* [[Hanali Celanil]]: Known as the Heart of Gold, Hanali was the Seldarine goddess of love and beauty, and an intense, but friendly, rival of Sune. Her splendorous crystal palace in Arvandor was so well-made that a single candle, if properly placed or slightly readjusted, could brighten or darken the entire structure. One couldn't look inside from the outside, but from within it was like looking through exceptionally clear glass.\n\n* [[Kirith Sotheril]]: Known as The Magess, Kirith was the Seldarine goddess of magic, specifically the subtler schools of enchantment and divination, and she resided in the realm of [[Tethridar]] with her lover [[Tethrin Veraldé]]. It was a small, pleasant domain with an open field, a large copse of trees, and a fruit orchard.{{Cite dragon/155/The Elfin Gods|14,17}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\">[[Kirith Sotheril]] and [[Tethrin Veraldé]] are placed into Arvandor by [[Dragon magazine 155]] and it is implied the whole Seldarine lives in Arborea by ''[[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]''.  [[Dragon magazine 236]] places them into [[Elysium]] instead, but is the only source that names their realm. This article assumes that their realm in Arvandor also has this name.\n\n* [[Labelas Enoreth]], Known as The Lifegiver, Labelas was the Seldarine god of longevity and time. Aside from Corellon's, only his whims determined if wizardly necromancy would work in Arvandor. The exact location of his home was a mystery, some saying it was under one of Arvandor's huge hills and others claiming that it was a vanishing tower that appeared as an omen of trouble or new elf leadership.\n\n* [[Melira Taralen]]: Known as The Songstress, Melira was the Seldarine goddess of bards and music, and the daughter of Hanali Celanil, who sent her to Corellon to serve as an apprentice. She was most often in her mother's domain, singing and playing while Hanali relaxed.\n\n* [[Mythrien Sarath]]: The Watcher over [[Mythal]]s, Mythrien was the Seldarine god of the titular elven wards. After losing much of his power, he never left Arvandor, remaining cloistered in his palace of [[Mythralan]]. Invisible but tangible mythal fields swirled around the palace as it levitated off the ground, and only Corellon and [[Sehanine]] could bypass the barriers without his permission.<ref name= \"MotSp30\">{{Cite dragon/251/Magic of the Seldarine|30}}\n\n* [[Naralis Analor]]: The Watcher of Souls, Naralis was the Seldarine god of the afterlife, as well as healing and easing pain. His realm was known as the Healing Glade, and it was where he performed his divine duties.{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited|15}}{{Cite dragon/155/The Elfin Gods|24}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note2\"> Similarly to Kirith and Tetrin, Naralis is stated to dwell in Arborea in Dragon magazine 155 and implied to lives there by Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. Dragon magazine 236 places him into Elysium and is the only source that names his realm.\n\n* [[Rillifane Rallathil]]: Known as the Leaflord, Rillifane was the Seldarine god of the woodlands and the harmony of nature. At once his corporeal form and his realm, he was depicted as a great, ethereal oak tree in the heart of Arvandor similar to the Yggdrasil, so huge that his roots penetrated reality and reached into the Prime Material Plane.\n\n* [[Sarula Iliene]]: Known as the Nixie Queen, Sarula was the Seldarine goddess of fresh water, including lakes, rivers, and rain. Her residence was at the bottom of a huge lake in Arvandor called [[Brythanion]], a palace of glass and marble where she was served by nixies and fresh water creatures.{{Cite dragon/251/Magic of the Seldarine|31-32}}\n\n* [[Sehanine Moonbow]]: The Daughter of the Night Skies, Sehanine was the Seldarine goddess of death and dreams and the mightiest of the female elven deities. She shared Corellon's tower in Arvandor, spinning webs of illusions and omens from behind its marble walls.\n\n* [[Shevarash]]: The Black Archer, Shevarash was the Seldarine god of vengeance and loss. He had no realm of his own, but he often visited Arvandor.\n\n* [[Solonor Thelandira]]: Known as Keen-Eye, Solonor was the Seldarine god of archery and hunting, whose domain in Arvandor was thick with forests and fast-flowing streams. The center of this region was the [[Pale Tree]], a magnificent (possibly mystical) white arbor with silver leaves and muddy gray roots that contrasted the surrounding deep green grove. Solonor usually prowled his domain looking for creatures that had to be slain or relocated.",
            "Brightwater": "Brightwater was no less beautiful than Arvandor for its civilization, being a well-settled realm of quaint cottages and elegant manors bustling with constant movement and activity, all of it fun. Gaudy structures were built besides shacks, for it was a domain of short-term spending. Merchants dressed like princes and workers dressed like paupers (and vice versa) crowded the streets, and some of the greatest and wealthiest beings of the planes could be found there. Any diversion imaginable could be found there, including music, dancing, drinking, gambling, horse races, festhalls, and nearly any earthly pleasure, with each form of entertainment excellent, plentiful, and available at one of the hundreds of taverns and gaming halls.\n\nThe sprawling, urban realm lived by the motto of carpe diem, priding itself on taking stupid chances and living for today. Three times as reckless and daring (and lucky) than three ordinary towns, Brightwater often succeeded at what it did and was respected for trying even if it failed. Though much of its glamour was surface level glitter, the entire plane was permeated with a sense of freewheeling adventure, frolicking joy, exotic delight, and youthful excitement. Joy, fortune, and beauty were its focus, and those elements shined from every structure. Scams and cons were common, but the gods of the realm didn't look kindly on dishonest rogues, and oaths were especially sacred there. Though taking chances and living life to the fullest were phrases sometimes spoken cynically in Faerun, they were at the heart of Brightwater.\n\nBrightwater was a relatively recent realm, founded by the Torilian trio of Lliraa, Sune, and Tymora. Given their respective youth, the three had a greater sense of adventure than other pantheons, uniting them together, and weren't as bound by tradition, their city being the least tame and predictable in all Arborea. Brightwater was far enough away from Olympus that the Greeks, though most considered it an eyesore, left it alone, and others sometimes visited. Hermes and Erevan were even said to visit when they wanted to party without upsetting their pantheons.\n\nSune was the leader of the group, with the others deferring to the eldest and most respected member, although the younger two received more attention. Tymora had brought the drive to create Brightwater and most of the real planning, and Lliraa was just happy to be included. Originally the city was divided into three sectors, but it later expanded to include more districts.\n\n* [[Lliira]]: The Lady of Joy, Lliira was the Faerunian goddess of dancing and merriment. Her realm, the Quarter of Orange Lanterns, was the most notorious district of Brightwater, a place of unceasing celebration with milling crowds, picnics, summer dances, and courtships by day, and a loud carnival of music, dance, drink, and revelry by night. Those rich with coin spent huge sums on luxuries, and Lliira's followers spread the joy.\n\n* [[Sharess]]: The Lustful Mistress, Sharess, Faerunian goddess of hedonism and sensuality, joined the trio of Torilian gods in Brightwater after the [[Time of Troubles]], establishing her own quarter of the city. Between Lliira and Sune's realms, both in terms of location and philosophy, was her quarter of Rapture. It was the city's darkest district, a sector filled with shadowy alleys and somewhat shady establishments.\n\n* [[Sune]]: Known as Lady Firehair, Sune was the Faerunian goddess of love and beauty. Her realm, the Heartfire Quarter, was the smallest sector of Brightwater, and more quiet and private, consisting of hidden courtyards and tiny rooms surrounded by festhalls, inns, and matchmaking shops. It was a place of mystery and bliss, and its inhabitants searched the unexplored paths for the perfection found in passion and the truths of love.\n\n* [[Tymora]]: Known as Lady Luck, Tymora was the Faerunian goddess of good fortune and victory. Her realm, The Quarter of the Great Wheel, was the largest and most popular (if not heard of) district, a grandiose place where adventurers and daredevils gathered to boast of feats past and to come, and wagers of all sorts were made. It was also the judicial district, where criminals had to try their luck and attempt to win themselves a pardon.\n\n* [[Waukeen]]: Known as the Merchant's Friend, Waukeen was the Faerunian goddess of wealth and commerce, and had placed her realm in Brightwater after the Time of Troubles. Her realm, the Marketplace Eternal, laid in Brightwater's center, and its streets were packed with buyers and sellers at all times. Though it was the only district dedicated to business besides pleasure, in the realm of enterprise, trading was its own intoxicating form of fun.",
            "Others": "* [[Chih-Nii]]: Goddess of weavers and love, Chih-Nii was the shy daughter of the [[Celestial Emperor]] of [[Kara-Tur]]. Though she had a realm on Olympus, called the Loom of the Celestial River, she preferred to dwell amongst the [[bariaur]] of Arborea, tending to sheep and silkworms while watching over star-crossed lovers.\n\n* [[Hlal]]: Known as the Jester, Hlal was the [[Draconic pantheon|draconic]] god of humor and messages, and was known to lair in some secret site within Arborea.<ref>\n\n* [[Iallanis]]: [[Giant pantheon|giant goddess]] of love, beauty and mercy, Iallanis's realm of [[Florallium]] was on Arborea's 1{{st}} layer. Consisting of crystal springs and quiet gardens, Florallium was, by the tacit consent of the gods and petitioners, a neutral ground for giantish beings. It was where peace was negotiated in times of conflict, and where fortuitous events could be celebrated in times of peace.\n\n* [[Morwel]]: The Faerie Queen, Morwel was the leader of the [[eladrin]]s, and controlled the seat of their power, the timeless [[demiplane]] known as the [[Court of Stars]]. Not even gods could enter without her consent, and so long as nightfall covered the land, it could go between the layers of Arborea, even in and out of divine realms, at her whim. She reigned from a crystal palace within the autumnal, sylvan forest, under its starry sky.\n\n* [[Nephthys]]: The Lady of Sands, Nephthys was the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] goddess of wealth, guardian of the dead, and sole deity residing in Pelion. Her home, a palace of dun-colored stone, was located in her realm of [[Amunthys]], a vast desert with ever-shifting boundaries. It was unknown if she had caused Pelion's condition or was holding it back, but she nonetheless protected its many crypts, tombs, crematoria, and mausoleums.\n\n* The [[Seelie Court]], the pantheon of [[fey|faerie]] deities including [[Titania]], [[Oberon]], [[Caoimhin]], [[Damh]], [[Eachthighern]], [[Emmantiensien]], [[Fionnghuala]], [[Nathair Sgiathach]], [[Sqeulaiche]] and [[Verenestra]], dwelt in the identically named [[Seelie Court (divine realm)|Seelie Court]], a wandering demiplane that temporarily stayed in Arborea at times. It consisted of calm glades and woods eternally gleaming with moonlight.<ref><ref>\n\nOne of Arborea's most attractive features was an enigmatic fountain that could hardly ever be found. Called Canathas by the Greeks, [[Evergold]] by the elves, and alternatively called the Fountain of Beauty or Fountain of Youth, it was a pool of crystal blue water surrounded by golden sand. Its sheen was so bright that it hurt the eyes to gaze upon it, and by bathing in its waters, one could enhance their appearance for a limited time.\n\nThe reported location of the Evergold was highly variable. Some said it rested in the center of Hanali's crystal palace in Arvandor, where she used it as a kind of crystal ball. Others claimed it could be found in Sune's Heartfire district, Aphrodite's palace in Olympus, or that it could only be accessed through the eladrin Court of Stars. In truth, all of these answers were correct; Evergold was not a stationary site but a phenomenon that shifted throughout Arborea on a pattern that few but gods had deciphered, appearing wherever it was needed.\n\nRegardless of where it was, the various like-minded goddesses of beauty and glamour shared its bountiful waters. The Norse goddess [[Freya]], and many other deities not known in Faerun made use of the fountain. Sharress began frolicking in and around the Evergold with other goddesses after the Time of Troubles. Sune's access to the pool also went to ensure that the raucous youth of Brightwater's deities would stay strong for an eternity."

        "Rumors and Legends": "Arborea was not always home to the Elven and Olympian pantheons, the two divine groups having asserted themselves after banishing two other pantheons from the plane.\n\nFirst were the Seldarine, a comparatively tiny and emaciated group next to the brawny [[giant pantheon]], who, under Corellon, challenged the giants for dominion. Seeking glory, the elven pantheon abandoned their former home of Ysgard and took Arborea in a battle of gigantic proportions, leaving the giants to flee to the lands they had once occupied, and leaving behind many of their treasures. One could still find the stone cities and halls of the giants scattered throughout elven lands, massive stone buildings with {{SI|50|ft}} or higher walls (a scale matching that of the plane) more like hills than products of artifice. Iallanis, who had stayed at the hearthside during the war, was allowed to stay, though the Seldarine didn't respect her much.\n\nThe Olympians arrived later, having gathered together to defeat their forefathers, the greater titans, and cast most of them into Carceri. The leader of the greater titans, [[Cronus]], having heard that his own children would cause his downfall, devoured nearly all of them, only for his wife Rhea to trick him into swallowing a stone before allowing their sixth son, Zeus, to escape. Eventually Zeus returned and poisoned Cronus, causing the titan to vomit back up his siblings, the catalyst that allowed the Olympians to exile them to the Tarterian Depths. After establishing a foothold on many Prime Material worlds, they later made their permanent mark on Arborea, where they either created or took control of the titan-created Mount Olympus.\n\n{{Fq\n| width  = 300px\n| source = A planar sage\n| text   = Pelion's one of those wonderful places with no explanation. The places we haven't figured out are always the most interesting.\n}}\n\nArborea was a plane of secrets and enigmas, from the unpredictable path of the Evergold, to what entities and secrets once and still resided in the sands of Pelion. The elven domain of Arvandor was the region of Arborea best known to Material Plane visitors, and it too was a mystery, even to the elves themselves. Beyond that domain were even more hidden matters, perhaps realms ruled by deities unknown. It was said that only the gods knew the secrets of the Olympian Glades, and even then the more adventurous deities could still be stumped by its greater mysteries."
