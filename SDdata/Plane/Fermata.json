The realm was reachable via a hard-packed dirt road, between the Gilded Hall of the Sensates and Tymoras realm of Brightwater. By foot, the journey from the Gilded Hall to Fermata took about half a day.\nLike the entire plane of Arborea, Fermata was filled with lush green vegetation, mighty oak trees, cedars, fields of wheat, oat, and fragrant windflowers.
