'''Nessus''' was the ninth and deepest layer of the [[Nine Hells|Nine Hells of Baator]].

==Geography==
The layer was a featureless plain with jagged edges that extended {{SI|2500|mi|k|long=yes}} from east to west and {{SI|1100|mi|k|long=yes}} from north to south, floating in an endless red void. The plains were scarred by chasms and ravines several thousand miles deep, and were frequently ravaged by fiery storm winds.

===Geographical Features===
The River [[Styx]] trickled down into Nessus through a little-known, small offshoot. It was heavily guarded by [[devil]]s who slew any unauthorized visitors on sight. The river drained into a shallow pool known as the [[Forgotten Lake]], then continued at the bottom of some of the crevasses before percolating through the earth and continuing its course into [[Gehenna]].

The River [[Lethe]] also flowed across Nessus, occasionally also falling into its trenches and ravines.

==Government==
The layer was ruled directly by [[Asmodeus]], who presented himself as an illusion of a tall, red-skinned, slender man. He was assisted by a court of [[archdevil]]s that included the Chancellor of Hell [[Adramalech]], Inquisitor [[Phongor]], and several commanders. His [[pit fiend]] generals included Executioner [[Alastor]], Asmodeus's majordomo [[List of archdevils#Baalberith|Baalberith]], and Constable [[Martinet]].

==History==
Asmodeus allowed [[Zariel]] to recover in Nessus from the wounds sustained by her fall before assigning her as Duchess of [[Avernus]].

==Rumors & Legends==
{{fq

}}
The [[tiefling]] midwife [[Destiny Agganor]] from [[Nightstone]] had a set of runes burned onto her front door to ward off unwanted visitors. It contained a prayer that included damning any intruders to burn in Nessus for almost a century.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Malsheem]], the largest city in all of the [[Outer Planes]] and home to Asmodeus. Located at the bottom of an enormous trench directly below the portal from [[the Pit]] in [[Cania]], it was inhabited by millions of devils held in reserve for an unknown cataclysmic battle. Asmodeus's citadel of [[Fortress Nessus]] rose far above the plain from the bottom of the rift.
* The [[Serpent's Coil (Nine Hells)|Serpent's Coil]], the deepest rift of the layer, said to have been blasted as a result of Asmodeus's fall into the Hells. It was home to his true form as he healed from the wounds sustained by his fall. The blood shed by Asmodeus's wounds constantly sprouted new devils, perfect specimens of pit fiends and [[cornugon]]s.
* [[Tabjari]], a citadel made of [[copper]] that stood along the walls of [[Reaper's Canyon]]. It contained one of the three copies of the [[Pact Primeval]]―the other two remaining in [[Mechanus]] and [[Mount Celestia]].

==Inhabitants==
Nessus was inhabited by a majority of greater devils, including Asmodeus's legions of [[amnizu]]s, pit fiends, and cornugons, among others.
