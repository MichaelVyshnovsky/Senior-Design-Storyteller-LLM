'''Mungoth''', also known as '''the Burning Ice''',

==Geography==
Mungoth was far less volcanically active than the topmost two layers [[Khalas]] and [[Chamada]], but not completely extinct. There were still cool lava furnaces that provided a dull reddish glow to the layer, as well as volcanic vents that continuously spewed ash into the air. Nevertheless, temperatures across the layer were very low, so that it was under almost constant snowfall. The snow mixed with the volcanic ash turned [[acid]]ic and could rapidly damage unprotected living creatures, burning through most ordinary clothing.

Upon hitting the ground, the snow and ash mixture turned into thick mud that made the slopes extremely slippery. Mudslides and lava flows were common and frequently buried the caves that could serve as temporary shelters from the acidic snow.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Death's Embrace]], realm of [[Velsharoon]].
* [[Ondtland]], realm of [[Loviatar]].
* The [[Valley of the Outcasts]], the hideout of the [[fire giant]] [[wizard]] [[Testuo]], an outcast from fire giant society who was sympathetic towards other outcasts, providing shelter when needed. Testuo maintained arrangements with several [[yugoloths]] to ensure the location's safety.
