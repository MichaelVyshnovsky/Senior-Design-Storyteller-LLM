        "Description": "Lunia was a large mountain-island sparsely covered with citadels of white stone, atop white cliffs, and with the palaces of minor deities. Visitors reported different architectural styles for these citadels. Some of the citadels were located on separate islands, some of which were miles long. Trading towns also dotted Lunia, and [[Aquatic elf|sea elves]] from the [[Prime Material plane|Material plane]] were commonly found engaged in trade there.\n\nSome cosmologists considered Lunia something like a subsection of the greater mountain of Celestia;\n\nIt was always night here, but the dark sky was full of silver stars collectively so bright that a moon was not needed to provide light, and the temperature was like that of a summer's night.\n\nMost of the ''[[portal]]'' connections from other planes came into this layer. During stormy weather, the sound was like that of thunder.\n\nThe Silver Sea contained all manner of sea life, from schools of tiny silver fishes, to sea elves, [[dolphin]]s, and [[Celestial creature|celestial]] [[whale]]s, to giant creatures of the deep. In calm weather, some of these creatures could be heard singing songs of praise toward the [[Celestial archon|archons]]. Those who could not swim were quick to be rescued by the [[zoveri]] and led to shore&mdash;assuming that they were not a kind of creature harmed by holy water!\n\nTo reach Lunia with the ''[[plane shift]]'' spell required a [[gold]] planar fork tuned to the note of D.{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|42-43}}",
        "Government": "[[Image:Barachiel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Barachiel, the ruler of Lunia.]]\nThe ruler of Lunia was [[Barachiel]], one of the [[celestial paragon]]s of the archons. He commanded all of Celestia's forces against attacks on the sacred mountain, though these rarely occurred. He reigned from the [[Citadel of Stars]].\n\nLunia was divided into 196 provinces, each with a [[throne archon]] serving as governor. These 196 thrones reported through the hierarchy up to Barachiel.{{Celestia province governors}} The defense of Lunia was ensured by the host of [[hound archon]]s.",
