'''Venya''', also known as the '''Pearly Heaven''', was the third layer of [[Mount Celestia]].

==Geography==
The layer was softly illuminated by an iridescent white sky whose appearance resembled mother-of-[[pearl]]. Unlike [[Mercuria]], whose mountains were jagged and tall, Venya's mountains were smooth and round, all covered in meadows, arable land, woodlands, or mountain vegetation such as alpine grasses and shrubs. Some had snowy peaks. The rivers that ran through the layer were warming, only partially freezing during winter. The layer's [[petitioner]]s had dammed some of the smaller creeks to form lakes to irrigate their fields and to power mills in the carefully tended fields.

==Notable Locations==
; The [[Glass Tarn]] : A cold mountain lake that contained conduits to the [[Astral Plane]], the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], [[Ysgard]], and the [[Outlands]]. It was rumored to grant prophecies or visions to visitors who provided it with sincere offers.

; [[Green Fields]] : The realm of [[Yondalla]], [[Arvoreen]] and [[Cyrrollalee]], as well as the [[afterlife|final resting place]] of [[halfling]] [[soul]]s.
