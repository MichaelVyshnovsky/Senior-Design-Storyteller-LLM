'''The Blood Tor''' was the 13{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], home of the Maid of Misfortune, [[Beshaba]], and the Bitch Queen, [[Umberlee]]. In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the Blood Tor was considered the part of the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]] in [[Gehenna]].

{{quote|''Beshaba's realm is the thirteenth layer of the Abyss. Long ago, the layer was flooded to prevent the [[baatezu]] from ever invading it again. Umberlee, the evil goddess of the sea, makes her realm in those waters. Towering over the waters is the Blood Tor, a massive rocky peak that some sages say rivals [[Mount Olympus|Mt. Olympus]] in size. Beshaba and her court live in a cavern complex within the mountain, somewhere near the pinnacle.''|[[Selûne]], The Moonmaiden.}}

==Geography==
The Blood Tor was one of the layers of the Abyss survivable by mortals and [[planewalker]]s. The Tor was a large peak of black rock, surrounded by a complex of steep boulder-strewn slopes, tress-like ridges, and treacherous ravines and chasms. The realm of the Blood Tor was illuminated; however, it was unclear what was the source of light.

Black rocks of the Blood Tor hid numerous caverns, often used by Beshaba's devotees and servants. The goddess herself was known to use caves with pools of blood-red water as her ''[[scrying]]'' bowls as she dispensed cruel punishments on those who slighted her.

A single tower of [[granite]] stood on the summit of the Blood Tor—the palace of the goddess of ill luck Beshaba.

The Blood Tor held ''[[portal]]s'' to other layers of the Abyss.

===Flora & Fauna===
Very little vegetation could be found on the Blood Tor. The most common plant life was the red and black [[lichen]] that grew on the black and grey rocks of Beshaba's mountain.

The 13{{th}} layer of the Abyss was home to huge black [[stag]]s, totem servants of Beshaba. These creatures haunted the visitors of the Maid of Misfortune's realm. and deadly [[fetch]].

==History==
The Blood Tor was considered one of the greatest [[tanar'ri]] military successes of the [[Blood War]]. The layer was the site of a major but unsuccessful baatezu blitz.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Beshaba used one of her blood-water ''scrying'' pools to punish [[Doljust]], an aging nobleman who had displeased the goddess of ill-luck. She watched Doljust as he faced off against a [[werebat]]. The creature's cave had two dead toddlers in front of it, which was a grim omen of things to come. The goddess swayed the noble's [[dog|hound]], forcing the beast to pounce at the [[lycanthrope]] as Doljust swung his [[sword]]. As the man mourned his beloved dying dog, Beshaba's vengeance became apparent. Doljust swung his blade once again at a sound that came from behind. A moment later, another, smaller werebat, cleaved by Doljust's sword, shifted back to its humanoid form. The adolescent werebeast was a young child who whispered "grandfather" as he died in his older relative's arms. Satisfied with her work, Beshaba dismissed the ''scrying'' spell and left the cave with the blood-red pool.

Later the same year, a group of adventurers, sent by Beshaba's fellow Torillian deity [[Finder Wyvernspur]], arrived at the Blood Tor. [[Joel]] the Rebel Bard, a winged fighter named [[Jasmine]], and a cheerful [[kender]] called [[Emilo Haversack]] traveled the deadly slopes of the Tor towards Beshaba's tower, thinking that the Lady of Misfortune was behind recent power surges that plagued Beshaba's sister [[Tymora]]. During their travels, [[Iyachtu Xvim]] attempted to lead the group to certain death in the guise of a god from the world of [[Krynn]], [[Sirrion]]. The adventurers faced a deadly fetch, survived, and eventually discovered the Beshaba suffered the same affliction as her sister, sending waves and quakes of her divine power across the Blood Tor and wreaking havoc on Toril.

Following the events of the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the Blood Tor became part of [[Tempus]]'s divine realm of the [[Warrior's Rest]] in [[Limbo]].

==Notable Locations==
*'''Gallowshill''', a cloistered fortress on the Blood Tor that belonged to a [[marilith]] general Taramanda. The fortress was closed to all by the general's most trusted advisers.

==Inhabitants==
The goddess herself resided in the granite tower, served by petitioners, [[alu-fiend]]s, and other abyssal creatures. Beshaba was occasionally visited by her good consort Tempus.

===Notable Individuals===
*[[Airdna]] and [[Okim]], Beshaba's loyal servant alu-fiends ''circa'' 1368 DR.
