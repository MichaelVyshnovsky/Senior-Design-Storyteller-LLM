The '''True Grove''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Eldath]], the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] goddess of groves and watersheds.

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], this realm was located in [[Eronia]], the rugged and mountainous second layer of the [[plane]] known as [[Elysium]]. While in the [[World Tree cosmology]], the True Grove was situated in the [[House of Nature]] alongside the divine realms of other nature deities.

==Description==
The True Grove was said to be a burbling spring that was surrounded by a ring of tall [[oak]] trees, though the exact boundaries of the realm were uncertain.

==History==
After having resided on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] for many years, Eldath established the divine realm of True Grove in the [[Outer Planes]] in [[1369 DR]]. With the size of her faith being what it was, it was unknown where she received the divine burst of power necessary to make such a signifcant move. Among church scholars many deities were speculated as having been involved, but the ones lauded as being most likely to have aided Eldath were [[Chauntea]], [[Mielikki]], and [[Mystra]].

==Inhabitants==
This divine realm was primarily inhabited by Eldath's [[petitioner]]s. Like other divine realms in the House of Nature, [[humanoid]] petitioners would gradually take on animal traits and over the course of centuries transform into [[celestial creature|celestial animals]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Legends claimed that there ''[[portal]]s'' to True Grove were hidden in various woodlands all across Toril. These included, but were not limited to &mdash; at [[Eldath's Water]] in the [[Misty Forest]], in the [[Elven Court]] near either [[Elventree]] or [[Lake Sember]], in the depths of the [[Forest of Tethir]], in [[High Forest]] near the upper reaches of the [[Unicorn Run]], in the heart of [[King's Forest]], atop [[Oak Hill]], and in various areas of [[Turmish]].
