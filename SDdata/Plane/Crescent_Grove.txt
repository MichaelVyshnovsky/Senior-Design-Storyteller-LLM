The '''Crescent Grove''', also called '''''Gwyllachaightaeryll''''' (meaning '''the Many-Splendored''' in the [[Elven language]]) or simply '''Corellon's Tower''', was the great palace of [[Arvandor]] and the [[divine realm]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Sehanine Moonbow]].

==Cosmography==
The Crescent Grove was at the center of the [[Seldarine]]'s joint realm of Arvandor. In the [[World Tree cosmology]], Arvandor was one of the [[Celestial planes]].<ref>

==Description==
The palace was an ever-changing blend of nature and art, combining an architecture of white [[marble]] pillars and walkways with enormous white-barked trees. Many turrets went out from the main spire in a confusing yet beautiful way.  Many petitioners of Arvandor spent their time here, reflecting in quiet contemplation and enjoying some undisturbed solitude. The tower resonated with the presence of its deities.

Inside the tower, the appearance of the rooms was ever-changing. They were decorated with numerous elvish works of art, both beautiful and terrible. Only the throne room at the center remained a constant.

===Notable Areas===

;Overlook
:At the center of the palace stood the rising tower with windows of crystal called the Overlook. It offered a breathtaking view of the entire realm, and even into the [[Prime Material plane|prime]] worlds that were home to elves. It was a favorite destination for visitors.In contrast to the description in the ''[[Player's Guide to Faer√ªn]]'', the depiction of Corellon's Tower in ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' shows Wisdom's Height as the tallest spire at the centre of the palace.

;Wisdom's Height
:The palace's throne room was named Wisdom's Height. As an annual event, visitors could gain an audience with Corellon and Sehaine themselves here.

;The Bough of Magic's Gain
:An area dedicated to the magical arts; according to rumor, meditating here for a whole year brought a leap in the understanding of magic.

;Pureblood
:This part of the palace was designated for the healing of the soul, meant for elves who experienced the taint of evil or the weariness of life.

;Vigil's Rest
:This was the area for the healing of the body, where ailments and illnesses could be remedied.

;Council Hall
:This big tower was the meeting ground of the [[Seldarine]], but also open to visitors.

==History==
The palace was originally a tower built by [[giant]]s, which the Seldarine wrested from the [[Giant pantheon|giant powers]] together with the rest of the Arvandor. It had long since been transformed into a truly elven affair.
