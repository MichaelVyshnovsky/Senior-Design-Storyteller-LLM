        "mainbody": "'''Eronia''' was the second layer of [[Elysium]]. A rugged and mountainous land of strong winds, it contained the [[divine realm]]s of [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]], [[Hiatea]], [[Lathander]], [[Mystra]], and [[Urogalan]], as well as the shared realm of [[Enlil]] and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].",
        "Description": "The layer was marked by a rising landscape, with steep hills and mountains that rose beyond brightly lit clouds from deep valleys of white [[granite]]. At the bottom of the valleys, the River [[Oceanus]] flowed in a winding pattern, cutting canyons and gorges and flowing in rapids and extremely tall cascades. Eronia was the most dangerous section of the Oceanus's course, and could only be successfully negotiated by experienced navigators, who called themselves \"river rats\".\n\nUnlike [[Amoria]], Eronia had a much larger variability in the seasons, with harsher winters and hotter summers than the typical temperate regions of [[Prime Material plane]] worlds. Windy snow and lightning storms were common.\n\nThe wind was so strong throughout the layer that flying creatures had their maneuverability in the air considerably impaired.",
        "Cosmography": "[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash, extended its branches to this layer, as well as all other layers of Elysium, except [[Belierin]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Dweomerheart]], realm of [[Mystra]].\n* The [[Great Mother's Garden]], realm of [[Chauntea]].\n* The [[Great Mountain of the East]], realm of [[Enlil]] and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] of the [[Untheric pantheon]].\n* [[Morninglory]], realm of [[Lathander]] and [[Ushas]].\n* [[Precipice]], a community of [[aarakocra]] and [[giant eagle]]s built high up on the face of a steep [[sandstone]] cliff overlooking a lagoon formed by the Oceanus. It was rumored to be visited occasionally by [[Syranita]] and [[Remnis]].\n* [[Soulearth]], realm of [[Urogalan]].\n* The [[True Grove]], realm of [[Eldath]].\n* [[Woodhaven]], realm of [[Hiatea]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Eronia's inhabitants lived in small towns built atop plateaus or squeezed between the mountains and the Oceanus. The rugged geography and the inclement weather posed a constant challenge to whoever set up residence in the layer.\n\nThe Untheric [[deity]] [[Nanna-Sin]] also dwelt in Eronia, but did not have a fixed realm."
