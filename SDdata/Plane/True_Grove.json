        "mainbody": "he True Grove was the divine realm of Eldath, the Faer√ªnian goddess of groves and watersheds.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, this realm was located in Eronia, the rugged and mountainous second layer of the plane known as Elysium. While in the World Tree cosmology, the True Grove was situated in the House of Nature alongside the divine realms of other nature deities.\nThe True Grove was said to be a burbling spring that was surrounded by a ring of tall oak trees, though the exact boundaries of the realm were uncertain.\nAfter having resided on the Prime Material world of Toril for many years, Eldath established the divine realm of True Grove in the Outer Planes in 1369 DR. With the size of her faith being what it was, it was unknown where she received the divine burst of power necessary to make such a signifcant move. Among church scholars many deities were speculated as having been involved, but the ones lauded as being most likely to have aided Eldath were Chauntea, Mielikki, and Mystra.\nThis divine realm was primarily inhabited by Eldaths petitioners. Like other divine realms in the House of Nature, humanoid petitioners would gradually take on animal traits and over the course of centuries transform into celestial animals.\nLegends claimed that there portals to True Grove were hidden in various woodlands all across Toril. These included, but were not limited to &mdash at Eldaths Water in the Misty Forest, in the Elven Court near either Elventree or Lake Sember, in the depths of the Forest of Tethir, in High Forest near the upper reaches of the Unicorn Run, in the heart of Kings Forest, atop Oak Hill, and in various areas of Turmish."
