        "Description": "Pluton was not as cold as [[Niflheim]] but still a cool place. However, its vegetation was that of a subtropical place, It was believed that these trees had [[petitioner]]s inside them and [[druid]]s could feel the trees' sadness.\n\nThe [[Blood War]] was not waged in Pluton but sometimes [[fiend]]s came to get the soul of a particularly skilled person.",
        "Cosmography": "The base of [[Mount Olympus]] was located in Pluton, close to the entrance to the realm of [[Hades (realm)|Hades]]. Since it avoided the upper layers of [[Oinos]] and Niflheim, it was frequently used by travelers, despite being a dangerous and treacherous route.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Corpus": ": Corpus was a city that was made of people. For example, streets were made of living bodies.",
            "The [[Hill of Bones]]": ": The Hill of Bones was a place where [[nightmare]]s went to die. The place was sacred to them and removing a bone incurred the wrath of all nightmares who learned of the theft."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "One of the legends about the origins of the [[Raven Queen]] stipulated that she was originally a [[sorceress]] who led a rebellion against a [[god]] of [[Death domain|death]] who held domain in Pluton. Other deities recognized her as one of their own, but, in order to prevent her from becoming a tyrant much like the defeated deity, granted her domain over death but not the dead themselves."
