        "Description": "Pandesmos was the most hospitable layer of the plane. The caverns were the largest here, some literally thousands of miles across. Immigrants to Pandemonium tended to live on the surfaces of these massive caverns, which contained both cities and citadels, though these were very rare. Most caverns were abandoned to anything but wind. Despite the size of the caverns, they were as loud and windy as the rest of the greater plane, though the velocity of those winds was slightly less. Entire nations could fill the cavern walls, but the strong winds prevented this from ever happening.\n\nThe [[Styx]] began here, fed by countless cold streams flowing along the walls of the otherwise rocky, subterranean wastes. Some of the streams even floated through the open space in the centers of the caverns.\n\nDead-end tunnels with unusually strong winds (even for Pandemonium) often signaled that one was at a barrier and about to pass to the lower layer of [[Cocytus]]. Flat, square portals found in Pandesmos led to [[Limbo]], the first layer of the [[Abyss]] and the [[Outlands]]. Yellow squares led to Limbo, red squares to the Abyss, and black to the Outlands. The portals were inconsistent, however, and sometimes sent travelers to the wrong planes.\n\nTo reach Pandesmos with the ''[[plane shift]]'' spell required an [[iron]] planar fork tuned to the note of Câ™¯.{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|42-43}}",
