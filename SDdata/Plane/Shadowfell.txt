The '''Shadowfell''', also known as the '''Plane of Shadow''', was one of the [[planes of existence]] in various [[Cosmology|cosmological models]]. Its purpose and characteristics evolved as new cosmologies were formulated. Other names for this plane included '''Shadowland''', the '''Demiplane of Shadow''', the '''Shadow Deep''', and simply '''Shadow'''.

It existed as sort of a counterpart to the [[Feywild]], in the sense that it was a reflection, or "echo", of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Unlike the Feywild, it was a bleak, desolate place full of decay and death.
{{quote|It is the toxic plane of darkness and power.<br />It is the hidden place that hates the light.<br />It is the frontier of worlds unknown.}}

==Cosmologies==
===Shadowfell in the Great Wheel Model===
According to early versions of the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the Plane of Shadow was considered only a [[demiplane]]. Demiplanes formed out of the proto-matter that ebbed and flowed about the [[Ethereal Plane]], creating a finite plane with its own Border Ethereal whenever a critical mass was achieved. The largest of these was called the Demiplane of Shadow, and was made up of both [[positive energy|positive]] and [[negative energy|negative]] energy in equal measure.{{Cite dragon/213/The Demiplane of Shadow|23}} For those traveling through the Ethereal Plane, the [[Ethereal curtain|"curtain of vaporous color"]] for the Demiplane of Shadow was the color silver. Very little was known about the Demiplane of Shadow other than it was a dim and dismal place.

In later and revised versions of the Great Wheel cosmology, such as the one following the [[Second Sundering]], the Shadowfell was considered a [[parallel plane]], or an "echo" of the Material Plane, coexisting with it along with the [[Feywild]].

===Shadowfell in the World Tree Model===
{{Quote|There are many worlds, young elf. The Shadow Deep connects them all. It's the one mirror that shapes their many lights.|Melegaunt Tanthul, [[Nightal 24]] [[1371 DR]].}}
In the [[World Tree cosmology]] model, the Plane of Shadow was seen as an infinite plane that coexisted with the [[Prime Material Plane]]—touching it at all points and having the same basic geography Naturally occurring intermittent portals called vortices appeared between this plane and the Material Plane in seemingly random areas of heavy shade or darkness. The entry and exit point of a vortex were unpredictable as was their duration, lasting a few days at most.—before stepping back into the Prime, but arriving at a particular destination was much less precise than before. Intrepid travelers could still reach other universes by traversing the Shadowfell and locating the border with an alien world such as [[Oerth]] for example.

===Shadowfell in the World Axis Model===
[[File:Shadowfell.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''The desolate landscape of the Shadowfell.'']]
In [[1385 DR]], the Year of Blue Fire, [[Shar]] succeeded in engineering the murder of [[Mystra]] by [[Cyric]], plunging the multiverse into years of upheaval and chaos called the [[Spellplague]]. The [[Elemental Plane|Elemental and Energy Planes]] collapsed into the [[Elemental Chaos]] but not before Shar managed to manipulate some of the necrotic energies from the [[Negative Energy Plane]] and inject it into the Plane of Shadow.

==Description==
[[File:Black Rift.jpg|thumb|right|A swamp cabin beside the [[Black Rift]] in the [[Shadow Swamp]].]]
The most striking and immediate impression a visitor to the Plane of Shadow experienced was the lack of color and light; no sun, moon, or stars adorned the vault of the inky black sky, and all things looked as if the color had leeched out, leaving nothing but black and white, which in the dimness were more like "dark black" and "light black". A light source only illuminated half the distance it normally would, flames and fires put out less heat, and spells that dealt with light or fire were less predictable and prone to failure, whereas shadow spells were enhanced. On the other hand, although it would not illuminate as far, any light source on the plane could be spotted at a distance of up to ten times its normal range of illumination, such was the contrast to the constant gloom, similar to a star in the night sky. Even a light source that only put out shadowy illumination, like a ''[[darkness]]'' spell or a [[lantern]] burning [[shadowlight oil]], could be seen up to five times its range of illumination.

Gravity and time were the same on the Shadowfell as on the Prime, Landmarks were usually recognizable but altered in some bizarre way: buildings might be constructed in a different style, built with different materials, at a different location, and/or in any condition from dilapidated ruins to its normal appearance, for example, or otherwise strange and distorted. Similar sites were sometimes called "shadow-analogues".

Due to the ever-changing landscape, the Plane of Shadow was subject to relatively frequent but very small earthquakes (called shadow quakes) that resembled an ''[[earthquake]]'' spell in an area about two hundred feet (sixty meters) in diameter. For those on the ground, damage was equivalent to a Prime earthquake, but shadow quakes could also disrupt the ''shadow walk'' spell and dump unfortunate travelers onto the Shadowfell in the middle of the disturbance at a place very likely unknown and far from their destination.

[[File:Shadowfell - Julian Kok.webp|thumb|300px|''The Shadowfell was a place of death, dread, and despair.'']]
Some areas on the Plane of Shadow seemed to have an affinity with the [[Negative Energy Plane]] and life-draining [[undead]] such as [[shadow]]s, [[ghost]]s, and [[vampire]]s. These "darklands" had a minor [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|negative-dominant]] trait and unprotected visitors immediately felt the life force being sucked from their bodies&mdash;unless they exited the darkland quickly, all that was left of them was a pile of ash. Someone with protection from negative energy could stop and admire the utter desolation in an otherwise forlorn landscape, and perhaps make the acquaintance of the truly inimical undead. Thankfully, no natural vortices opened into darklands regions, preventing the unwary from stepping through into almost certain death, and keeping the creatures that thrived there from having easy access to other planes. Material Plane locations such as desecrated burial mounds, haunted battlefields, and [[necromantic]] foci frequently had a darkland echo on the Shadowfell.

Other less dangerous but quite unsettling echoes occurred in areas analogous to towns and cities in the Prime Material Plane. They were nothing more than mirages, but familiar faces and places seen through the macabre mirror of the Shadowfell could be very demoralizing. Structures might appear altered, dislocated, destroyed, or replaced entirely by something else. Mirages of the living had visages of distorted nightmares, but were still recognizable enough to give travelers a jolt of fear and revulsion.

Air, water, and food existed on this plane, supporting plants, animals, and some [[humanoid]]s adapted to the shadow environment. Visitors could survive indefinitely if they were willing to endure thick, foul-smelling water, food that oozed dark blood, and a pervasive nip of cold in the air. A visitor could never feel warm, would often hear or sense the presence of things that weren't there, and could never shake the feeling of being watched. It was a constantly unsettling place. 

The morphic nature of the Shadowfell could produce strange effects, mainly in areas like the [[Black Rift]] that were especially morphic, and with events that had a particular affinity with the plane, like death. For example, in the Black Rift alone, a pile of bodies caused more skeletons to appear, until there were thousands. More bizarre were the strange biers upon which dead bodies spontaneously appeared, apparently drawn from wherever they rested, anywhere in existence, only to disappear after a few seconds, presumably to wherever they'd come from. Stalactites in a cave dripped ephemeral shadowstuff, which was reabsorbed into the plane rather than form a puddle. Even common mushrooms bore realistic humanoid faces, capable of twitching or blinking. More significantly, forests of grasping tendrils sprouted from some surfaces and reached for passersby, similar to the ''[[black tentacles]]'' spell.

===Phenomena===
[[File:Shadowfellsummoning.png|thumb|273x273px|A creature of the Shadowfell summoned to the mortal realm.]]
Known as "[[shadowstuff]]", the material of the Shadowfell could be manipulated by [[illusionist]]s to form semi-real monsters and quasi-real [[evocation]]s that were still effective (to a lesser degree) even if the target successfully disbelieved the illusion.

Another tool of illusionists was the ''[[shadow well]]'' spell, which could turn a creature's shadow into a temporary gateway into the Shadowfell. If successful, the victim was sucked into the Shadowfell through his or her shadow and spent a few moments in a pocket realm (a very tiny [[demiplane]] attached to the Shadowfell) being terrorized by dark phantasms. No physical harm resulted from this spell, but mental and emotional trauma resulting in a fear response was possible.

An unsuccessful attempt to build a gate to the Shadowfell could result in what was termed a [[failed Shadow Gate]]. A being that stepped through one was taken only momentarily to the Plane of Shadow, but in that moment a "seed of shadow" was implanted in their flesh. This could cause their flesh to be subsumed by shadow, and they would see it mist away into darkness. Many died, reduced to bare skeletons, but those who survived acquired the powers of a [[dark creature]].

==History==
The earliest known conscious interaction of the peoples of [[Toril]] with the Plane of Shadow was in the time of the [[Imaskari]] empire. In the Late period, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-3500}}, the archwizard [[Madryoch the Ebon Flame]] was focused on researching the secrets of the Shadowfell and plotted to use its dark power to overthrow Lord Artificer [[Omanond]]. His plans were thwarted by a young adept named [[Hilather]]. Knowledge of the existence of the Plane of Shadow was presumably lost with the fall of the Imaskari empire because it was some three thousand years later, in the [[-533 DR|Year of Plentiful Wine, &minus;533 DR]], that the [[Netherese]] rediscovered it and began their study.

In [[1235 DR]], the [[Black Horde]] attacked Faerûn. The Horde defeated [[Eldrith the Betrayer]], who would go on to betray [[Baldur's Gate]]. They killed her and she was reborn out of hatred. In her soul of hatred, the [[Onyx Tower]] was created and tied to her life. The [[Onyx Heart]] was located in the Plane of Shadow and only with its destruction could the Onyx Tower be destroyed.

An [[Drogan Droganson's pupil|adventurer]] and their companions were exploring the ruined [[Netherese]] city of [[Undrentide]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. In an [[Arcanist's Tower]], they slipped through portals into its dark reflection on the Shadowfell, where they encountered [[shade]]s. The adventurer later escaped impending doom by traveling back to the Plane of Shadow using a magic mirror.

Although the souls of the dead did not begin to be drawn to the Shadow Plane until after the [[Spellplague]] and [[Shar]] transformed it into the Shadowfell, it was possible to trap a soul there. Notably, this happened to a king of [[Damara]], [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], in the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], by a cabal of wizards allied to the [[lich]] [[Sammaster]]. King Gareth's soul was rescued in the following year by a phalanx of [[paladin]]s led by the [[smoke drake]] [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]].

In the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], [[Shar]]ran and [[Cyric]]ist cultists based in the [[Shadow Swamp]] on the Plane of Shadow, plotted to tear apart the [[Weave]] from the [[Black Rift]]. Adventurers pursued them through the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] to the Shadow Swamp and disrupted their efforts, and found the [[Black Chronology]] among their detritus. That same year, a rift to the Shadowfell was opened in the skies over [[Sembia]] and the city of [[Ordulin]] was destroyed when a shadowy tract of land fell on it.

In [[1376 DR]], eight brave heroes ventured into the Plane of Shadow and defeated one of its guardians, [[Mordoc SeLanmere]], and destroyed the [[Onyx Heart]].

A major change afflicted the Plane of Shadow in [[1385 DR]] when [[Shar]], having successfully arranged [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]'s death, bound the energies of the [[Negative Energy Plane]] with the plane.

After the [[Second Sundering]], the Shadowfell no longer was a waypoint for the souls of the dead on their way to the Fugue plane, but it remained known as the Shadowfell for most people.

Around 1492 DR, [[Ketheric Thorm]], formerly a Chosen of Shar before he changed allegiances and became the Chosen of Myrkul, imprisoned the [[aasimar]] Dame [[Aylin]] within a soul cage located within the Shadowfell.

==Rumors and Legends==
The special and unique nature of this plane caused not only cosmologists to speculate about its origins, but visitors and planar travelers as well. Some believed the Plane of Shadow had spontaneously formed as a [[demiplane]] out of the [[Ethereal Plane]].

However, most cosmologists and planewalkers with a sense of adventure liked to talk about the legend of the Shining Citadel. Briefly, the legend postulated that the Plane of Shadow was once bright and colorful like the Material Plane, but at some point in the distant past a mysterious group who worshiped the plane's creator took all of the light, color, and most of the life-force from the rest of the plane and concentrated it into a mighty citadel. One would think that a structure containing most of the energy from an entire [[plane of existence]] would be hard to miss, but no one has ever found the Shining Citadel, except perhaps, as the legend states, those who venture into the deepest parts of the Plane of Shadows and never return.

A theory bandied about among sages stated that the [[Underdark]] was bottomless because it eventually became the Plane of Shadow. The only evidence supporting this hypothesis was that permanent ''portals'' to the Shadowfell were increasingly common the deeper one delved.

==Notable Locations==
[[File:ShadowfellExplorers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Exploring the Shadowfell.'']]

; [[Chaulssin]] :Located almost ten miles (sixteen kilometers) below the surface of [[northwest Faerûn]], beneath the northernmost peak of the [[Rauvin Mountains]],{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|1}} this was originally a [[drow]] city that was captured by [[shadow dragon]]s in the [[-221 DR|Year of Shambling Shadows, &minus;221 DR]]. Under the influence of shadow dragons for hundreds of years, the city was slowly absorbed by the Plane of Shadow until their overthrow in the [[634 DR|Year of the Darkspawn, 634 DR]]. Abandoned in the [[734 DR|Year of the Splendid Stag, 734 DR]], the fringe of the Shadowfell continued to ebb and flow through streets and buildings filled with dangerous shadow creatures.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|2}} Chaulssin was reestablished in the [[1136 DR|Year of the Shadowkin Return, 1136 DR]], by [[Jaezred Chaulssin|House Jaezred]] as a base for the shadow dragon&ndash;blooded drow assassins.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}}
; [[Chaul'mur'ssin]] :This city was established on the Plane of Shadow by the inhabitants of Chaulssin after fleeing an advancing army from [[Menzoberranzan]] in 734 DR. The Chaulssinyr hastily traveled through dangerous caverns until they found the abandoned lairs of their shadow dragon progenitors and claimed them, eking out an existence. Eventually the city thrived and became a power that demanded respect.
; [[Evernight]] :The dismal reflection of [[Neverwinter]]. It was believed to be the dark version of least one city in every world in the [[Prime Material plane]].
; [[Gloomwrought]] :A port city.
; [[Mulsantir]] :Travel between the Shadowfell and the Prime Material Plane was possible in certain places in [[Mulsantir]] at certain times of day. Shadow Mulsantir contained a Temple of [[Myrkul]], in the place where a Shrine to [[Kelemvor]] stood on the Prime. Within this temple was found a portal leading to Kelemvor's domain, the [[Fugue Plane]].
; [[Shadow Swamp]] :The [[Vast Swamp]] between [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] had a Shadowfell counterpart, called the [[Shadow Swamp]]. Although the environment was similar in many ways, it was a great black swamp, where the water was dark and still and only moved sluggishly through the channels. Nevertheless, the landscape was different; there seemed to be more water than in the fast-growing Vast Swamp. Sites in the Vast Swamp had echoes here: the [[Lost Refuge]] in the material world had a counterpart in the so-called [[Shadow Citadel]], which followed the same plan but was even more ruined. A ''portal'' called the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] linked the two. On the other hand, a flooded fissure that formed an ordinary lakebed in the Vast Swamp was reflected in an empty canyon in the Shadow Swamp, known as the [[Black Rift]]. Swamp water flowed in on all sides, yet the water at the bottom never rose and never seemed to drain out, an entirely unexplained phenomena of the plane. The Black Rift was especially morphic—although it remained more-or-less the same shape overall, local changes in terrain were extreme and bizarre. The interplay between the magical [[Weave]] and the [[Shadow Weave]] was especially malleable, a trait which attracted the followers of Shar.
; [[Sphur Upra]] :Located nine miles (over fourteen kilometers) below the surface of [[east Faerûn]], between the surface nations of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Murghôm]], this city was established on the Shadowfell in {{Yearlink|-2954}} by five [[gloaming]] families seeking security and community. After almost 3,500 years, they expanded their city by creating ''portals'' to the [[Prime Material Plane|Material Plane]] in the [[534 DR|Year of the Spitting Viper, 534 DR]], and became a major trading post for goods between the two planes.
; [[Thultanthar]] ([[City of Shade]]) :This floating enclave of [[Netherese]] origin entered the Plane of Shadow just before [[Karsus's Folly]] brought down the empire in [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, &minus;339 DR]]. Over the centuries, its population acclimated to the new environment and became known as [[shade]]s. In the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], Thultanthar was brought back to the Material Plane and became known as the City of Shade. The inhabitants then began the rebuilding of the Netherese empire.

===Realms===
Only three [[deities]] were known to have claimed the Plane of Shadow as their home:

*[[Mask]], the Master of all Thieves and Lord of Shadows had a realm on this plane called [[Shadow Keep]]. It was made out of shadowstuff and was extremely difficult to see even when standing right next to it.
*[[Shar]], Mistress of the Night and Lady of Loss, once resided in a high tower called the [[Palace of Loss]]. It had no apparent means of entry or exit, but her followers had no trouble gaining access. She sometimes kept prisoners there so she could enjoy their suffering. After the [[Spellplague]], she moved her abode to the [[Towers of Night]] and left behind a deep dark hole guarded by evil creatures. This [[Foundation of Loss]] exuded palpable grief and was reported to contain a portal to her home in the Towers of Night.
*[[Null]], [[Draconic pantheon|draconic god]] of death, had realms named the [[Mausoleum of Chronepsis]] and the [[Mausoleum of Pain]] in the [[Outlands]] and [[Carceri]], respectively. Parts of these were thought to exist on the Plane of Shadow at the same time.<ref>

===Domains of Dread===
[[File:Gates_of_barovia.jpg|thumb|230px|''The gates of Barovia, one of the Domains of Dread.'']]
{{Main|Domains of Dread}}

In remote corners of the Shadowfell there were [[demiplane]]s created by the [[Dark Powers]] which served as prisons to trap creatures of extreme evil to serve as sustenance.

One such demiplane was the valley of [[Barovia]], ruled by the [[vampire]] [[Strahd von Zarovich]], himself a prisoner of the Dark Powers. Passages to Barovia were rumored to exist somewhere in the [[Misty Forest]], based on reports of [[werewolf]] attacks and [[Vistani]] presence in [[Daggerford]] and surrounding areas.

[[Elminster |Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale]], had shown himself aware of count Strahd and his mist-filled domain, as well as how to journey to-and-from there somewhat freely. He briefly sent [[volo|Volothamp Gaddarm]] to Barovia to explore the valley, although Volo was initially unaware of the dangers.{{Cite dragon+/6/Travel Talk: Volo's Visit to Barovia}}

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Shadowfell-shadar-kai-5e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The [[shadar-kai]], denizens of the Shadowfell.'']]
The Shadowfell was home to a mysterious form of [[undead]] called [[shadow]]s, other "shadow" creatures such as the [[shadow mastiff]] and [[shadow dragon]], and a race of [[humanoid]]s known as [[shade]]s. In addition to those, there were numerous other inhabitants, such as communities of [[shadar-kai]], [[Shadovar]], and [[dark one]]s.{{Cite dungeon/190/New Monster Theme: Shadowborn|1}}

Probably the most dominant race of beings on the Plane of Shadow were the shades&mdash;descendants of ancient [[Netherese]] [[human]]s who resided on the plane in their floating city for centuries and acquired many abilities from immersion in shadow essence. [[Malaugrym]]s may have been superior to shades, having the advantage of being [[shapeshifter]]s and practically immortal unless killed in some fashion; but their small numbers, fierce independence, and difficulty in mastering interplanar travel made them much less organized and effective.<ref group="note">The ''[[Player's Guide to Faerûn]]'' states on page 165 that the malaugryms are actually native to a small [[demiplane]] attached to the Plane of Shadow.

Other creatures that were either native to the plane or attracted to it included [[bodak]]s, [[ephemera]] of all kinds, [[veserab]]s, [[lich]]es, [[shadar-kai]],

[[Shadow demon]]s also inhabited this plane. These [[fiend]]s were responsible for the creation of the race known as [[krinth]], having interbred with [[Netherese]] slaves.

[[Shadow sea serpent]]s were not native to the Plane of Shadow but were bred there by the Shadovar, crossing warm-blooded carnivorous orcas with vile shadow creatures. These serpents hunted in packs both in the sea and on land.

Especially during the period between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]], the Shadowfell became also prominently populated with dead creatures such as [[ghost]]s, [[specter]]s, and other [[undead]] who for whatever reason refused to leave the Shadowfell and continue on to the [[Fugue Plane]].

===Notable Inhabitants ===
*[[Ambergris (person)|Ambergris]], [[dwarf]] [[Shadovar]] [[cleric]] of [[Dumathoin]] and former member of [[Cavus Dun]].
*[[Afafrenfere]], human Shadovar [[monk]], former member of Cavus Dun, former member of [[Brothers of the Gray Mists]], and former member of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].
*[[Dark Powers]], vestiges of ancient dead [[evil]] [[god]]s that either dwell on the plane or were banished there, and feed on evil creatures that become trapped in the Shadowfell.
*[[Drasek Riven]], a godling, had his fortress here, where he hid from [[Rivalen|Rivalen the Nightseer]] and the archdevil [[Mephistopheles]], both of whom shared a piece of the divine essence Drasek himself had.<ref>
*[[Draygo Quick]], a [[Netherese]] lord and powerful [[warlock]].
* [[Effron|Effron the Twisted]], [[tiefling]] Shadovar warlock, and former student of Draygo Quick.
*[[The Ghost King]], a composite being formed from: [[Hephaestus]] a [[dracolich]]; [[Crenshinibon]] and its seven disembodied [[lich]]es; and the sentience of [[Yharaskrik]], an [[illithid]]; which had powers over the undead denizens of the Shadowfell.
*[[Glorfathel]], [[elf]] Shadovar [[wizard]] and member of Cavus Dun.
*[[Herzgo Alegni]], tiefling Shadovar warlord, who wielded [[Charon's Claw (sword)|Charon's Claw]].
*[[Jermander]], a tiefling Shadovar [[warrior]] and member of Cavus Dun.
*[[Parbid]], tiefling Shadovar monk, member of Cavus Dun, and the [[Brothers of the Gray Mists]].
*[[Parise Ulfbinder]], a Netherese lord.
*[[Ratsis|Ratsis the Spider Farmer]], a human male [[shade]] and member of Cavus Dun.
*The [[Raven Queen]] had a divine realm known as the [[Fortress of Memories]] here.
