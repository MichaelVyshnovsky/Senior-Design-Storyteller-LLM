The '''Hoard''' was a [[demiplane]] created in [[116 DR]] when five wizards of [[Cormyr]] trapped [[Nalavarauthatoryl]] in the [[Grodd]] demiplane. Unlike the Grodd demiplane in which Nalavarauthatoryl was imprisoned, the Hoard demiplane was far more "vivid". The Hoard demiplane and the Grodd demiplane were linked via a ''[[gate]]''.
