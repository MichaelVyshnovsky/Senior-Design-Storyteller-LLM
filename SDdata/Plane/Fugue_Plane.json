        "mainbody": "The Fugue Plane was a neutral plane within the Astral Sea where the souls of mortals were drawn when they died. The vast majority of this plane was flat, gray, bland and nondescript, with no notable topographical features. The sky overhead was also gray. The planes only significant feature was the City of Judgment, in the middle of which stood the Crystal Spire where Kelemvor and Jergal resided, and it served as the formers dominion.\nThere were three typical methods of getting to the Fugue Plane as a divine servant collecting a deitys future petitioners, through non-permanent portals from the Nine Hells or the Abyss, or through death. One could also enter the Fugue Plane using a gate in the temple of Myrkul located in shadow Mulsantir. There were reports that this plane also connected with the Shadowfell.\nThe petitioners of the City were the servants of Kelemvor and Jergal. The False and the Faithless also inhabited the realm. The servants of Kelemvor and Jergal enacted punishments on the False and acted as a city militia to protect against tanarri raids and, on rare occasions, attack the Abyss to punish demons for attacking the city.\nSouls could reside in the city for up to a tenday before a divine servant came to collect them, often completely clueless to the fact that they were dead. During that time, baatezu were allowed to inform souls of their state and bargain with them. Souls were offered the chance to become devils themselves, usually starting as a lemure but having the chance to advance through the devilish ranks, possibly even becoming a pit fiend. This was the main way baatezu propagated. The prospect of becoming a devil might seem abhorrent to good-aligned mortals but those who followed evil deities and those who feared what awaited them in the afterlife were much more likely to take up the offer. This agreement did not prevent devils from outright stealing souls."
