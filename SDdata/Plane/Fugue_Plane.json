        "mainbody": "The '''Fugue Plane''' was a [[neutral plane]] within the [[Astral Sea]] where the souls of mortals were drawn when they died. The vast majority of this plane was flat, gray, bland and nondescript, with no notable topographical features. The sky overhead was also gray. The plane's only significant feature was the [[City of Judgment]], in the middle of which stood the [[Crystal Spire]] where [[Kelemvor]] and [[Jergal]] resided, and it served as the former's [[dominion]].\n\nThere were three typical methods of getting to the Fugue Plane: as a divine servant collecting a [[deity]]'s future [[petitioners]], through non-permanent ''[[portal]]s'' from the [[Nine Hells]] or the [[Abyss]], or through death. One could also enter the Fugue Plane using a ''[[gate]]'' in the temple of [[Myrkul]] located in shadow [[Mulsantir]].<ref> There were reports that this plane also connected with the [[Shadowfell]].",
        "Petitioners": "The petitioners of the City were the servants of Kelemvor and Jergal. [[The False]] and [[the Faithless]] also inhabited the realm. The servants of Kelemvor and Jergal enacted punishments on the False and acted as a city militia to protect against [[tanar'ri]] raids and, on rare occasions, attack the [[Abyss]] to punish [[demon]]s for attacking the city.",
        "Kelemvor's Agreement": "Souls could reside in the city for up to a [[tenday]] before a divine servant came to collect them, often completely clueless to the fact that they were dead. During that time, [[baatezu]] were allowed to inform souls of their state and bargain with them. Souls were offered the chance to become devils themselves, usually starting as a [[lemure]] but having the chance to advance through the devilish ranks, possibly even becoming a [[pit fiend]]. This was the main way baatezu propagated. The prospect of becoming a devil might seem abhorrent to good-aligned mortals but those who followed evil deities and those who feared what awaited them in the [[afterlife]] were much more likely to take up the offer. This agreement did not prevent devils from outright stealing souls."
