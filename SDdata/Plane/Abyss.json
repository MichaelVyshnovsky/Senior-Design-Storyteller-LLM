This was ignoring the fact that layers were shaped by the conscious manipulations and subconscious wills of its resident demon lord, and so even the nature of a single layer could become obsolete by the time such information was established.",
        "Cosmology": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model, the Abyss was an [[Outer plane]] on the Great Wheel connected to the [[Astral plane]], [[Pandemonium]], [[Carceri]], and the [[Outlands]]. Some estimated that the Abyss had 666 layers, while the [[Fraternity of Order]] claimed to have catalogued 679 layers. It was possible that the number of layers was infinite, but no one could be certain. The first layer, named Pazunia after the demon lord [[Pazuzu]], was described as a barren, dusty place baking under a red sun, broken only by great [[iron]] fortresses, huge holes in the ground, and the river [[Styx]]. Some branches of the Styx flowed down the holes (which were conduits to the various layers) and some of these holes supplied water to the Styx in reverse waterfalls.\n\nWhen the Great Wheel model was replaced by the [[World Tree cosmology]] model, the river Styx was renamed the [[River of Blood]] and it flowed through all the [[fiendish planes]] (except for the [[Supreme Throne]] and the [[Demonweb Pits]]) originating in the Abyss, passing through the [[Blood Rift]]&mdash;an unusual plane that connected the Abyss with the [[Nine Hells]]&mdash;bringing the demons even closer to their arch-enemies the [[devil]]s, resulting in the [[Blood War]]. Cosmologists found evidence of portals between the Abyss and the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]], [[Clangor]], the [[Demonweb Pits]], and [[Hammergrim]], with intermittent portals to [[Deep Caverns]] and [[Fated Depths]].\n\n[[File:The Abyss.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Asmodeus]] and his armies attacking demons in the [[Blood War]].'']]\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], [[Asmodeus]] consumed the essence of the fallen [[Azuth]] and ended the Blood War by casting the Abyss to the furthest depths of the [[Elemental Chaos]]. The [[World Axis cosmology]] described the ruined Abyss as a domain with ever-changing features and realms, where the demons waged futile wars over meaningless empires. Once again the river Styx flowed through the [[Nine Hells]] and the Abyss, but then emptied its pollution into the [[Astral Sea]]. Other than the Styx or braving the Elemental Chaos, the only known passages to the Abyss were found in the [[Demonweb Pits]], the [[Dismal Caverns]], and [[Nishrek]].",
        "Layers": "[[Image:Abyss Map.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of the Abyss]]\n\n{{main|Layers of the Abyss}}\nThe number of layers in the Abyss was unknown and perhaps unknowable, with at least 679 having been catalogued but this article attempts to list them regardless of which cosmology model was in favor at the time of discovery. Each layer had its own characteristics, which were as varied as the demons themselves. All types of terrain, atmosphere, weather, gravity, and material composition were represented in the myriad layers. Some examples were:\n* [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|Air-dominant]]&mdash;zero gravity, no matter except air\n* Ash&mdash;blowing dunes of ashes\n* Battleground&mdash;[[Blood War]] or other\n* City&mdash;warrens and slums to citadels and palaces, teeming with demons\n* [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|Earth-dominant]]&mdash;solid rock tunneled by the inhabitants\n* [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|Fire-dominant]]&mdash;everburning flames with [[salamander]]s, ''etc''.\n* Delusion&mdash;appears to be Normal but the flowers are poisonous or the trees attack\n* Desert&mdash;endless tracts of black, white, or red sand with no water\n* Glacier&mdash;infinite black, white, or orange ice with few rocky peaks breaking the surface\n* Hellscape&mdash;a burning mix of magma, rock, and belching brimstone\n* Maelstrom&mdash;swirling, bubbling chaos like [[Limbo]]\n* Mountainous&mdash;rocky crags, precipitous cliffs, soaring peaks\n* [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|Negative-dominant]]&mdash;major or minor\n* Normal&mdash;similar to a Prime plane with various flora and fauna\n* Ocean&mdash;a trackless ocean, with a surface\n* Salt&mdash;crystalline badlands or desert\n* Sea&mdash;of acid, blood, garbage, insects, oil, or worms, ''etc''.\n* Swamp&mdash;noisome bog inhabited by predators\n* Undead&mdash;[[specter]]s, spooks, and [[ghost]]s\n* Volcanic&mdash;lava flows, earthquakes, volcanoes, and smoke\n* [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|Water-dominant]]&mdash;nightmarish creatures in the murk\n\nDespite its name and notoriety for being never-ending, it was not known whether the layers of the Abyss were truly infinite in number.The Abyss is often listed as infinite but so are the other Outer Planes, or, as per ''[[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition]]'', \"at least so large that they may as well be infinite.\" Part of the reason for this was that some places might have been so absolutely inhospitable that none, not mortal, nor god, nor demon lords themselves could survive (the deeper layers reportedly having been even worse in the past), and hence were not known about.{{Cite dragon/349/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Dagon: Prince of Darkened Depths|31}}\n\nWhile the hundreds of layers of the Abyss might seem to utterly eclipse all other Outer planes put together, this figure was misleading. Besides the issue of uninhabitability, layers and [[divine realm]]s, the personal territories of [[power]]s, were often one in the same in the Abyss, whereas other planes often had several realms on one layer.\n[[File:Alkilith-5e.png|thumb|right|250px|An [[alkilith]] weakens the fabric of reality, opening a window into the Abyss.]]\nIn the very depths of the Abyss, the heart of the plane was constantly cleaving through the primal foundations of the cosmos, as it had since before the dawn of mortals, spawning new layers. Conversely, the Abyss was also capable of losing layers. The individual layers of the Abyss had primal urges and a constant need for nourishment, shrinking and weakened until nothing was left if not fed. Alternatively, they might be absorbed by other layers, only able to escape this state by acquiring sufficient sustenance. Occassionally the battling of demons over control of a layer could become so cataclysmic that the entire realm was outright obliterated.\n\nLayers could also be intentionally removed, such as when [[Lolth]] expended much of her divine energy seperating the [[Demonweb Pits]], or when a pantheon of offended deities ripped out and condensed a demon lord's entire layer (with him still in it) and cast it into the [[Astral plane]]. Despite this ending in the Abyss, much like a hungry, rudely awakened beast, almost instantly striking down the entire pantheon in that case, the attack itself was successful, leaving nothing but a void and their own decomposing divine corpses.{{Cite dragon/357/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Demogorgon: Prince of Demons|30}}\n{{Fq\n| width  = 300px\n| source = [[Mordenkainen]]\n| text   = Some scholars number and name the parts of the Abyss, declaring that this demon lord or that rules a portion of the place.

        "Inhabitants": "{{main|Demon}}\nThere were myriad types of [[demon]]s, too numerous to catalog here, but including the [[tanar'ri]], [[obyrith]]s, and [[loumara]]s. Non-demonic life could be found in the Abyss as well, with both mortal explorers and captives and the [[petitioner]]s brought there after death. Many wicked [[deities]] also based themselves here.",
        "Afterlife": "{{Main|Afterlife}}\nBeliefs about the journey of souls to the afterlife changed with the shifting [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and the [[crystal sphere]] in which one resided. In some worlds, [[chaotic evil]] souls would travel directly to the Abyss and become [[mane]]s, the lowest form of sub-demon. Manes were treated as slaves, cannon fodder, and food by the demon lords. For mortals of [[Realmspace]], however,  all souls would first go to the [[Fugue Plane]] and await transport to their final resting place. Greedy demon lords would open a portal to the Fugue Plane and conduct raids to steal souls and bring them back to the Abyss to become manes. After the [[Spellplague]], [[Shar]] reshaped the [[Plane of Shadow]] and folded in what death energy did not get absorbed into the [[Elemental Chaos]] and created the [[Shadowfell]]. After that, souls on their way to the afterlife started their journey in the Shadowfell and most made it to the Fugue Plane to await judgment, but a few remained behind or were lost.",
        "Powers": "Relatively few [[Greater deity|greater powers]] carved out a realm in the Abyss because dealing with the ubiquitous hordes of demons and ambitious [[demon lord]]s would require too much of their attention.
