Mertion, also known as the Platinum Heaven, was the fifth layer of Mount Celestia.
With a sky not too different from Solanias, Mertion was home to vast plains and savannas that served as the mustering grounds for paladins and other lawful good servants. Instead of mountains, Mertion had majestic citadels and huge black spherical domes dotting the plains. Access to the next layer up was found at the tops of the domes.
The ruler of Mertion was Raziel, one of the celestial paragons of the archons. He was called the Crusader and was the patron of paladins.
 Empyrea  Also known as the City of Tempered Souls, it was located on the edge of a cold mountain lake. It was known to host many magical fountains with powerful healing properties, as well as many hospitals and expert healers.
