'''Mertion''', also known as the '''Platinum Heaven''', was the fifth layer of [[Mount Celestia]].

==Geography==
With a sky not too different from [[Solania]]'s, Mertion was home to vast plains and savannas that served as the mustering grounds for [[paladin]]s and other [[lawful good]] servants. Instead of mountains, Mertion had majestic citadels and huge black spherical domes dotting the plains. Access to the next layer up was found at the tops of the domes.

==Government==
The ruler of Mertion was [[Raziel]], one of the [[celestial paragon]]s of the archons. He was called the Crusader and was the patron of paladins.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Empyrea]] : Also known as the City of Tempered Souls, it was located on the edge of a cold mountain lake. It was known to host many magical fountains with powerful healing properties, as well as many hospitals and expert healers.

; [[Arvenna]] : Also known as the Chanting Grounds, it was a dusty plain and home to the souls of lawful good warriors.

; [[Rempha]] : Also known as the City of the Sands of Time, it was a town known for its temporal anomalies.

; [[Soqed Hezi]] : Also known as the City of Swords, it was a terraced town filled with paladins and martial organizations. 

; [[Bahamut's Palace]] : After the [[Spellplague]] it was reported that Bahamut's Palace was located atop a summit in Mertion.
