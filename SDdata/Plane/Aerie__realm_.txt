{{otheruses4|the divine realm|other uses|Aerie (disambiguation)}} 
'''The Aerie''' was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Seldarine|elven goddess]] of [[air]], weather and avians, [[Aerdrie Faenya]], which she shared with [[Syranita]], goddess of the [[aarakocra]]. Among the latter the place was known as '''Whistledge'''.<ref><ref group="note">Aerdrie Faenya's realm was not named in 2nd-edition sources. Syranita, said to share the domain of the elven goddess, had a realm called Whistledge. In 3rd edition, Aerdrie's realm was called the Aerie. This article assumes that all three places are the same.

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the Aerie could shift according to their deities' whims between the joint realm of the [[Seldarine]] in [[Arvandor]] and the homestead of more chaotic-minded [[Elf|elven]] [[petitioner]]s, [[Alfheim]]. The former was part of [[Arborea]]'s first layer (also called [[Arvandor (layer)|Arvandor]]); the latter lay in [[Ysgard]]'s first layer (also named [[Ysgard (layer)|Ysgard]]).<ref>

In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the realm was located within the plane of Arvandor.

In either case, it floated above the breathtaking landscapes inhabited by the earth-bound petitioners.

==Description==
The Aerie consisted of cloudy islands covered with double-topped trees and crowned by a bright aerial palace. It could be approached by means of flight, but even that was often difficult due to prevailing strong winds.
