        "mainbody": "The Pridelands were the divine realm of Nobanion, the Faer√ªnian deity of lions and other felines.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, this realm was located in Krigala, the daylit first layer of the plane known as the Beastlands. While in the World Tree cosmology, the Pridelands were situated in the House of Nature alongside the divine realms of other nature deities.\nThe Pridelands were said to be a vast savannah, dotted by groves of trees. Amidst one of these groves of trees was a permanent portal that connected the realm to Gulthmere Forest on Toril.\nThe Pridelands were created in the aftermath of the Godswar, with Nobanion having created the permanent portal that connected the divine realm to his longstanding territory on the Prime Material, Gulthmere Forest.\nThis divine realm was primarily inhabited by members of Nobanions Great Pride, lammasu and wemics, as well as his petitioners. Like other divine realms in the House of Nature, Nobanions humanoid petitioners would gradually take on animal traits, particularly those of felines. And over the course of centuries, they would transform into celestial animals. The sole exception to this were Nobanions wemic petitioners, who maintained their mortal forms indefinitely."
