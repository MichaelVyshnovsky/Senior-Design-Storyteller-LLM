        "mainbody": "The '''World Tree cosmology''' model was outlined in [[1372 DR|the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], and quickly became the most widely accepted model during those [[Era of Upheaval|tumultuous times]], supplanting the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].<ref group=\"note\">The World Tree cosmology model was introduced to the <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Forgotten Realms</span> with third edition D&D and offered little in the way of continuity with the Great Wheel cosmology model used in first and second editions. In the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'', pages 256–7, players learned of the treelike shape of the multiverse and an almost completely new set of [[Outer Planes]] with no reason, explanation, or calamitous event given for the change&mdash;effectively [[Wikipedia:Retroactive continuity|retconning]] the entire cosmology. Nevertheless, many of the planes and godly realms closely resembled those of Great Wheel cosmology, leading some fans to consider the World Tree an alternative representation of the planar arrangement. This is supported by occasional mentions of old Great Wheel planes in 3rd edition sources, such as the connections to [[Cocytus]] of [[Pandemonium]] occurring in [[Throrgar|Thorgrar, the Shrieking Abyss]], on page 179 of [[Underdark (sourcebook)|''Underdark'']]. The name came from the discovery of a sentient being that manifested itself as [[World Tree|a brobdingnagian tree]] that connected various planes of existence, much like the river [[Styx]]. The World Tree cosmological model was invalidated by the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]] and the decade that followed, during which the [[Elemental Planes]] collapsed into the [[Elemental Chaos]], the [[Ethereal Plane]]{{Cite web|url=http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75882/19777426/The_one_and_only_34;Ask_the_Realms_authorsdesigners_thread34;_3&post_num=4203#336694562|title=The one and only \"Ask the Realms authors/designers thread\" 3|accessmonthday=August 20th|accessyear=2012|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=June 2nd, 2008}} and [[World Tree]] were destroyed,<ref> and the Outer Planes that survived became drifting dominions in the [[Astral Sea]] as described by the World Tree model's successor, the [[World Axis cosmology]] model.\n\nBy the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]], some sages began to use again the World Tree cosmology model, despite the fact that other sages preferred to use the Great Wheel or the World Axis models.{{cite web|author=[[Jeremy Crawford]]|title=Jeremy's Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/558443947815489536|accessdate=2018-01-25}}",
        "Basic Structure": "The [[Inner Planes]], also known as the Elemental Planes plus the [[Energy Planes]], made the transition from the Great Wheel model to the World Tree model almost intact, the major difference being that they were connected to the [[Prime Material Plane]] via the [[Astral Plane]] instead of the [[Ethereal Plane]].The ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition'' did not include the planes of [[Blood Rift]], [[Clangor]], [[Deep Caverns]], [[Fated Depths]], or [[Jotunheim]] in the list of planes on page 258. They were added to the World Tree cosmology in the ''[[Player's Guide to Faerûn]]'', first seen on page 140. and severing nearly all interplanar connections except those to the Prime. Thus the connection map could be said to resemble a tree, with the Prime Material Plane being the trunk with roots \"descending\" to the Inner Planes and branches \"ascending\" to the Outer Planes. No longer arranged strictly by [[alignment]], the Outer Planes were grouped into three categories based on being predominantly [[Good]], [[Neutral]], or [[Evil]], regardless of the influences of [[Law]] or [[Chaos]]. The three categories were the [[Celestial Planes]] (good), [[Neutral Planes]] (neutral or unaligned), and the [[Fiendish Planes]] (evil).\n\nTwo more planes were discovered that also connected to all the Outer Planes: [[Cynosure]] and the [[Fugue Plane]]. Only [[Deity|deities]] could pass through the astral ''portals'' from their realms to Cynosure and back to their home plane.\n\nThe [[Plane of Shadow]] was upgraded from a [[demiplane]] to be coexistent with the Prime Material Plane, touching it at all points just like the Ethereal Plane, allowing rapid travel between distant destinations on the Prime. It was believed that the Shadow Plane also connected the Prime to other Material Planes, such as [[Oerth]] for example.\n\nAn adventurer's journey to another plane of existence was typically accomplished by means of an ''[[astral projection]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', or ''[[gate]]'' spell. ''Astral projection'' was considered the safest mode of exploring because one's physical body was left behind in a (hopefully) protected location while their astral self traveled through the mostly barren Astral Plane to a ''[[color pool]]'' that was the door to their destination. Upon arrival, a new physical body was formed out of the materials of the destination plane and this new body was therefore immune to any pervasive environmental hazards. (On the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] a body might be formed out of elemental fire, magma, and brimstone, for example.) In contrast, ''gate'' and ''plane shift'' transported one's body and possessions directly into possible peril.\n\nTravel between one Inner or Outer Plane and another without passing through the Material Plane was either difficult and dangerous or impossible without involving the mercurial gods and their servants. The World Tree did not tolerate intruders unless they had a good and noble reason for using it as a celestial shortcut. All manner of evil creatures swam in the river, lurked on the banks, piloted craft on the surface, or patrolled the skies above the River of Blood looking to catch anyone brave or foolish enough to navigate the deceptively smooth waters. And just like the Styx, any mortal immersed in the river immediately lost all memories.",
        "Coterminous, Coexistent and Transitive Planes": "Coterminous planes were linked at one or more points where travelers could cross over without the aid of magic. Two or more planes were coexistent if they overlapped completely, allowing movement by some (usually magical) means from one to the other at any point. A plane could be both coexistent and transitive.\n\n;[[Astral Plane]]\n:The Astral Plane was a transitive plane that was coterminous with all the known planes in the cosmology except for Cynosure and the Fugue Plane. However, in this cosmology model, the Astral Plane was a ''channeled'' transitive plane, meaning that once a traveler set out for a particular destination plane, only color pools for that destination were visible to and usable by the traveler. In addition, all branches of the tree-shaped Astral Plane only led to or from the Prime Material Plane&mdash;all Astral travel between any two Inner or Outer planes had to pass through the Prime. The plane itself was a silvery, timeless, weightless void with very little solid matter. Color pools were suspended disks of whatever color matched the chosen destination. [[Githyanki]] pirates were known to prey on the unwary.\n;[[Ethereal Plane]]<ref group=\"note\">The ''Player's Guide to Faerûn'' states on page 142 that [[Toril|Toril's]] Ethereal Plane is identical to the description given in the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide v.3.5|Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', so that source is considered applicable for this particular plane.\n:The Ethereal Plane was coexistent with the Prime Material Plane, touching it at every point. Magic spells, such as ''[[etherealness]]'' and ''[[ethereal jaunt]]'' could be used to phase out of the Material Plane and into the Ethereal. Once there, a traveler could still dimly see the Material Plane as if through warped glass but could move through solid objects and \"fly\" in any direction just by choosing to do so. The atmosphere was breathable but misty and full of billowing clouds of multicolored fog. Beings on the Material Plane could not normally see travelers on the Ethereal, but if magical means were found to target ethereal creatures then attacks such as ''[[magic missile]]'' could be used. The reverse was not true&mdash;ethereal travelers could not magically attack beings on the Material Plane. The Ethereal Plane was destroyed during the Spellplague.\n;[[Plane of Shadow]]<ref group=\"note\">The ''Player's Guide to Faerûn'' says on page 163 that \"most regions of the Plane of Shadow correspond exactly to the descriptions in the ''[[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition|Manual of the Planes]]'' and the ''Dungeon Master's Guide v.3.5''. Only the realms of [[Mask]] and [[Shar]] are exceptions.\"\n:The Shadow Plane coexisted with the Material Plane and could be used as a transitive plane for rapidly traveling long distances between points on the Prime. It was also the link between alternate universes such as [[Oerth]]. No connections existed between the Plane of Shadow and the Ethereal Plane, even though they both coexisted with the Prime. Casting the ''[[shadow walk]]'' spell allowed a traveler to enter the Shadow Plane and move about at the same rapid pace regardless of their normal movement rate, mounted, flying, or on foot. Landmarks were almost useless on this plane because not only could the shadow substance be manipulated by use of ''[[shadow conjuration]]'' and ''[[shadow evocation]]'' spells, but the plane itself morphed over time. After the Spellplague, Shar managed to weave some essence of death from the [[Negative Energy plane]] into the Plane of Shadow and created the [[Shadowfell]].",
        "Outer Planes": {
            "Celestial Planes": "The Celestial Planes were the home of deities and beings that were fundamentally Good in nature, word, and deed. Each of the Celestial Planes were connected to the Prime Material Plane by a branch of the Astral Plane. Additionally, each of them was coterminous with at least one \"neighbor\" via the World Tree, which could be used as a \"back staircase\" with the Tree's permission or tolerance. The roots reached into [[Arvandor]] and [[Dwarfhome]] from the trunk, which touched [[Brightwater]], the [[Golden Hills]], and the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]]. Extending from the trunk were branches to [[Dweomerheart]], the [[House of the Triad]], and [[Green Fields]], with the top of the Tree terminating in the [[Gates of the Moon]].\n\n;[[Arvandor]]\n:Formerly known as [[Arvandor (layer)|Olympus]] in the [[Great Wheel]] model, Arvandor was the home of the [[Seldarine]] and their cousin [[drow]] goddess [[Eilistraee]]. Arvandor was filled with natural beauty: a [[druid]]'s paradise. Known portals included passages to Brightwater, [[Dragon Eyrie]], the [[House of Nature]], and the [[Gates of the Moon]].\n;[[Brightwater]]\n:Brightwater was the home plane of [[Lliira]], [[Sharess]], [[Sune]], [[Tymora]] and [[Waukeen]]. Similar in beauty to Arvandor but less wild and more gentrified, Brightwater was a thriving community full of revelry and rollicking fun. Connections were known to exist between this plane and Arvandor, [[Green Fields]], and [[Heliopolis]].\n;[[Dwarfhome]]\n:Dwarfhome was the home of the [[Morndinsamman]], except for the exiled [[Deep Duerra]] and [[Laduguer]]. Dwarfhome consisted of one mountain big enough to swallow worlds and a smaller second peak called [[Mount Clangeddin]], both of which were full of industrious activity, expert craftsmanship, and astounding artistry. No portals were known to exist on this plane.\n;[[Dweomerheart]]\n:A beautiful city with structures only magic could create, Dweomerheart sat on the highest plateau above a warren of caves, caverns, and more plateaus, appearing like a shining university for the study of magic. [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] and [[Azuth]], as well as their subordinates [[Savras]] and [[Velsharoon]], made their home here. No known portals to this plane existed, requiring visitors to travel astrally or successfully placate the World Tree for passage.\n[[Image:GatesOfTheMoon.jpg|thumb|right|The Gates of the Moon]]\n;[[Gates of the Moon]]\n:[[Selûne]] was the primary resident of this plane at the top of the World Tree, along with [[Finder Wyvernspur]] and [[Shaundakul]]. A sea of iridescent water surrounded a stony island mountain topped by Selûne's silver palace, all bathed in perpetual moonlight. One portal to Arvandor was kept here by some [[eladrin]] but no others were known. However, the mysterious [[Infinite Staircase]] would appear during the full moon and was rumored to connect Selûne's realm to every city on every plane.\n;[[Golden Hills]]\n:Seven bucolic hills formed this plane, each one the home of a member of the [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnomish pantheon]]. The only member not present was [[Urdlen]], who was allowed to live in [[Hammergrim]]. Everything on this plane was either a golden hue or tinted, highlighted, adorned, trimmed, or plated with gold. The only known portal in the Golden Hills connected to [[Gond|Gond's]] realm in the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]].\n;[[Green Fields]]\n:Very similar to the Golden Hills except with more natural colors and cultivated fields, this plane belonged to the [[Yondalla's Children|halfling pantheon]] who mostly shared the plane rather than carve out personal realms. The plane of Green Fields was a rural paradise of small, non-permanent settlements where the inhabitants alternated hard work with enjoying the fruits of their labor. Somewhere on this plane was a portal to Tymora's realm in [[Brightwater]].\n;[[House of Knowledge]]\n:[[Oghma]], Gond, [[Milil]], and [[Deneir]] shared this plane, with its ancient oak forests and spring-fed pools occasionally interrupted by buildings which formed the [[Library of All Knowledge]]. In these buildings were the records of every field of academic study: spells and magic items, songs and music, science and alchemy, history and prophecy, writing and language. The only known portal to and from this plane was held by Gond and it connected his workshop to [[Flandal Steelskin]]'s realm in the [[Golden Hills]].\n;[[House of the Triad]]\n:This plane was composed mainly of three large mountains surrounding a central gigantic mountain called Celestia.<ref group=\"note\">The ''Player's Guide to Faerûn'' states on page 159 that Celestia \"exactly mirrors the plane of Celestia described in the 3rd edition ''Manual of the Planes'' and the ''Dungeon Master's Guide v.3.5'', and is the home of the [[celestial archon]]s and the archon paragons detailed in ''[[Book of Exalted Deeds (sourcebook)|Book of Exalted Deeds]]'', so the core D&D material is considered applicable for this particular plane. Mount Celestia had seven layers, each connected by portal from the highest point of one layer to the lowest point of the next higher layer. Only the lowest layer of Celestia was accessible from elsewhere on this plane or the Astral Plane. The gods [[Ilmater]], [[Torm]], and [[Tyr]] each had a realm atop one of the lesser mountains while [[Helm]] and [[Siamorphe]] maintained realms around the bases of the four peaks. No portals to or from the House of the Triad were known to exist but all ''color pools'' and temporary ''gates'' were guarded by Helm's watchtower and a powerful guardian. [[Bahamut]] had a palace made of [[gem]]s and precious [[:Category:Metals|metals]] that wandered about the lower layers of Celestia. After the Spellplague, [[Celestia]] and its surrounding peaks were set adrift in the Astral Sea.",
            "Fiendish Planes": {
                "[[Nine Hells]]<ref group=\"note\">Similar to Celestia, the ''Player's Guide to Faerûn'' on page 161 defers to the ''Dungeon Master's Guide v.3.5'' and the 3rd edition ''Manual of the Planes'' for description of the Nine Hells in the World Tree cosmology model and those sources should be considered applicable for the <span style=\"font-variant": "small-caps;\">Forgotten Realms</span> except where official sources contradict the core references.\n:The home of the [[devil]]s was a layered plane, only the first of which ([[Nine Hells#Avernus|Avernus]]) was accessible via the Astral Plane. Each layer except the bottom was punctured by a huge hole perhaps tens or hundreds of miles/kilometers across that dropped a few miles/kilometers to the next lower layer. The holes were roughly concentric and progressively smaller, forming a nine-tiered pit of gigantic proportions. Avernus was also coterminous with the Blood Rift and portals were known to exist leading to the Barrens of Doom and Despair and Clangor. The River of Blood not only flowed through Avernus but had tributaries and cascades on every layer. No deities made their home here, but each layer was ruled by a powerful [[archdevil]], each of whom answered to [[Asmodeus]], the ruler of the ninth and lowest layer."
            },
            "Neutral Planes": "There was also a group of planes whose inhabitants did not adhere strictly to either good or evil, or tolerated the presence of opposing alignments. The Neutral Planes, sometimes called the Unaligned Planes, were connected to the Astral Plane in the usual fashion but were host to neither a branch of the World Tree nor a channel of the River of Blood.\n\n;[[Dragon Eyrie]]\n:This plane consisted of one colossal mountain, from dark roots to a snowy peak, on, under, and about which the [[draconic pantheon]] maintained realms of appropriate habitat for their petitioners. No settlements except an occasional hermit were known to exist on this plane, as dragonkind guarded their solitude fiercely. A portal to [[Arvandor]] was maintained by [[Hlal]]  but there may have been temporary connections as each deity wished. [[Tiamat]] lurked in a dark cave deep below the mountain and had a portal to another realm in Heliopolis.\n;[[Heliopolis]]\n:Heliopolis was a vast sandy desert baked by an intense sun and cut by a great river of ''holy water'' called the [[River Isis]]. All lands along the river were lush and fertile and provided habitat for [[Mulhorand]]i petitioners. The entire plane was home to most of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] who gravitated around huge pyramids, temples, and stone monuments built in their honor along the riverbank and out into the desert. No portals were known to connect to Heliopolis except for [[Tiamat]]'s closely guarded gate, likely somewhere in the evil [[Set|Set's]] dark domain.\n;[[House of Nature]]\n:This plane was an unspoiled natural wilderness encompassing the climates and habitats of most [[natural creature]]s without any buildings or trappings of civilization. Many nature-oriented deities resided here, including [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]], [[Gwaeron Windstrom]], [[Lathander]], [[Lurue]], [[Mielikki]], [[Nobanion]], [[Shiallia]], and [[Ubtao]] as well as a great number of [[guardinal]] [[Celestial paragon|paragons]] and the deities of sentient creatures such as [[centaur]]s,\n;[[Jotunheim]]\n:Another vast plane of wilderness but on a scale to match the deities in the [[Giant pantheon]], Jotunheim was a land of extremes. Everything was bigger, grander, or harsher than normally found on the Prime Material Plane: trees, plants, animals both natural and magical, buildings, caverns, rivers, mountains, volcanoes, and even climates. This plane was host to both a [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|fire-dominant]] and a [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|cold-dominant]] region (the realms of [[Surtr]] and [[Thrym]] respectively). The only known portal to this plane connected Surtr's domain to the Elemental Plane of Fire.\n;[[Warrior's Rest]]\n:The ironically named Warrior's Rest was another plane where battles constantly raged, similar to Clangor and Nishrek. However, chaos reigned here and the landscape, which was mainly rocky desert, mesas, buttes, and badlands, slowly morphed in a fashion similar to the Great Wheel cosmology plane of Limbo except not as severely or rapidly. Beings with sufficient wisdom could alter the terrain in their immediate vicinity by exerting their will. There was also a large body of seawater for naval battles. No portals were known to exist on this plane. [[Tempus]] was the overlord here, but he allowed other deities of war and strife some autonomy in their realms."
        },
        "Cynosure and the Fugue Plane": "In the World Tree cosmology model there were two planes that, from a mortal's point of view, existed outside the model, disconnected from the Astral tree structure, but still played very important roles in the afterlife and the struggles between the [[Deity|Powers]].\n;[[Cynosure]]\n:A small, finite demiplane, Cynosure was a neutral meeting place for all the deities and [[elemental lord]]s of [[divine rank]] 0 or higher. The entire plane consisted of a large open-air amphitheater or meeting hall adorned with pillars under a starry night sky. Just outside, the structure was ringed with portals, one to each divine realm, that could only be activated by deities. No magic worked other than the portals and no ''color pools'' existed on Cynosure, preventing all Astral travel.\n;[[Fugue Plane]]\n:The Fugue Plane consisted of a flat, featureless plain surrounding the [[City of Judgment]]. All souls eventually traveled to this plane to await judgment or to be taken to the realm of their patron deity. No ''color pools'' appeared on this plane. The only sure way for mortals to get here was to die.",
        "Inner Planes": {
            "Elemental Planes": "In this cosmology model, before the Spellplague, the Elemental Planes were individual infinite planes of almost pure [[Element|elemental substance]].\n;[[Elemental Plane of Air]]\n:An endless blue sky with occasional intrusions of the other elements, the Plane of Air was the most hospitable of the Elemental Planes, but could still be very dangerous to the uninitiated. Travelers had to either be able to fly or master the technique of picking a direction for \"down\" and then falling in that direction until they hit something or picked a new direction. Landing safely on the surface of a floating island was a very tricky maneuver. [[Akadi]] the Lady of the Winds was the supreme power on this plane.\n;[[Elemental Plane of Earth]]\n:This plane was the most hazardous and inhospitable of the four Elemental Planes because it was nearly solid matter with few pockets of breathable air or water. The only well-maintained caverns were those found in the [[Great Dismal Delve]], a slave-labor mining operation run by the [[dao]]. Rich veins of [[:Category:Metals|metals]], and [[:Category:Gems|gems]] lured many prospectors but the environment and inhabitants, (which often looked just like the environment), were extremely dangerous.\n;[[Elemental Plane of Fire]]\n:Air, water, and earth are practically indistinguishable between the Prime Material Plane and their Elemental Planes, but not so with fire. Elemental Fire produces light, heat, and smoke like regular fire but does so without fuel or air and can take a solid, liquid, or gaseous form. Travelers to this plane required immunity to or protection from fire, and a way to breathe. Few places were hospitable to visitors but the most famous was the [[City of Brass]] ruled by the [[efreet]]s. [[Kossuth]] Lord of Flames was the ultimate power on this plane.\n;[[Elemental Plane of Water]]\n:No crushing pressure, but little breathable air, the Plane of Water was like an infinite swimming pool with no bottom or surface. Visitors needed the same abilities and precautions as they would being submerged in any large body of water. Tides, currents and whirlpools could pose significant threats to the unprepared. Aquatic life of myriad varieties lived (and hunted) here. [[Istishia]] the Water Lord held sway over this liquid domain.",
            "Energy Planes": "The Positive and Negative Energy planes were the source and drain, the push and pull, of life and death. Extremely inimical to mortal life, only the minor-dominant areas could be inhabited and they were in constant danger of being overwhelmed by a major-dominant flux. The Negative Plane drained all energy while the Positive Plane was pure energy in such abundance that mortal forms could not contain it. During the Spellplague all the Elemental and Energy Planes merged into the Elemental Chaos, but the goddess Shar folded part of the Negative Energy plane into the Plane of Shadow, forming the Shadowfell.\n;[[Negative Energy Plane]]\n:An eternally dark, barren place with no landmarks that ate light, heat and life. Some minor-dominant areas were favorites of [[necromancer]]s because they could survive and their magic was enhanced.\n;[[Positive Energy Plane]]\n:Continual bursting energy so intense it overwhelmed mortal senses, filling any vessel with life energy until it overflowed and exploded, disintegrating into component elements which then joined the frenetic vibration. Minor-dominant areas were prized for the enhanced healing properties."
