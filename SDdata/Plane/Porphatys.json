        "mainbody": "Porphatys, or more fully Porphatys of the Black Snow, was the fifth layer of Carceri.\nPorphatys looked like a string of planet-sized beads, or orbs, but without a string. The distance between two orbs was several millions of miles.\nThe cold orbs of Porphatys were each covered by a shallow ocean. The water was cold and acidic. People could die from bathing in it.\nAnother feature of Porphatys was the constant black snow, which was also acidic. It was especially dangerous to organic matter and made travel from one orb to another dangerous because giant clouds of it lay in the space between the orbs.\nThe ocean had small islands of the height of sandbars. They had a lot of caves and were desired living space for the inhabitants, who generally wanted to leave the entire layer.\nAs a general rule, buildings did not withstand the planes acidic nature.\nShip of One Hundred The ship, also called the White Caravel, harbored a hundred sarcophagi. Opening one made everyone on the ship disappear by unknown means.\nPetitioners of Porphatys were the souls of shallow and self-absorbed people. They were immune to the acid, but still felt the pain. They pushed each other from the islands into the ocean and ate each other. Occasionally Khamallan Teren, a vicious proxy of the Faer√ªnian power known as Malar, would come hunting through the planes shallows and cause its many petitioners to flee in terror."
