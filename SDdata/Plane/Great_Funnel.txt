The Great Funnel was a divine realm within the Elemental Plane of Air belonging to Akadi, the power of elemental air.
This realm existed within the Great Wheel cosmological model.
This realm was a gigantic whirlwind, said to be so large that it could swallow whole planets in its wake. It was a mobile realm, drifting across the Elemental Plane of Air as Akadi willed, and the winds it generated spiraled outward all across the plane.
