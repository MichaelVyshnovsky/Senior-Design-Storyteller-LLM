        "Location": "Ellaniath was a realm, with―uncharacteristically for a location―a moving history in the physical sense.\n\nIt was originally situated in Colothys, At some point in the 14{{th}} century DR, the planes shifted into the [[World Tree cosmology]] and Ellaniath was moved into the [[Demonweb Pits]] and hang among the strands as one of the baubles.\nAfter the [[Silence of Lolth]], Lolth yanked the Demonweb Pits out and turned them into an independent realm, Ellaniath returned to Colothys.\n\nOver the course of the [[Second Sundering]], both Vhaeraun and Eilistraee returned:{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 19841\n| postid     = 468322\n| whichpage  = 13\n| date       = 2015-04-17\n| accessdate = \n}} though the new location of their realms was not certain, the planes rearranged under the [[Great Wheel]] structure once again.",
        "Features": "Nobody outside of Ellaniath, save the ruling god, had an idea, where the realm was located, apart from the very general knowledge \"somewhere on Colothys\", and how it looked like. [[Vhaeraun]] wiped the memories of those who stumbled on his realm, which was considered a demonstration of his abilities as a thief.\n\nDuring its time in the [[Demonweb Pits]], it hang at one of the strands of the webs there as a bauble like the other drow deities’ realms.\n\nDuring the realm’s time on [[Arvandor]], Ellaniath merged with [[Eilistraee]]'s realm, the it looked like a forest under perpetual night with the half moon being the only source of light. The forest had shining moonstones as decoration, half among them gradually lost their light after Ellaniath's incorporation until they became pitch black.",

            "Power over the Realm": "[[Vhaeraun]], as a [[lesser deity]], could not only alter his realm in some fashion like setting temperatures as he liked or fill it with special sensory information, like light, sound and smell, when it came down to sound, he could also make intelligible speech as background sounds in his realm.\n\nVhaeraun, as a lesser deity, could also control his realm's link to the [[Astral Plane]], effectively controlling how good magical travel worked within his realm.",
            "Effects": "As part of the [[Demonweb Pits]], Ellaniath was divinely morphic, While there, Ellaniath was mildly chaotic and strongly evil aligned,\n\nOnce the realm was in [[Tarterus|Carceri]], Ellaniath was mildly evil aligned and still divinely morphic."
