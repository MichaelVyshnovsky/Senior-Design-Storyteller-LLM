        "mainbody": "'''Quietude''' was one of two [[divine realm]]s in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] belonging to the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic]] and [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity|goddess]] of marriage and [[magic]], [[Isis]].",
        "Cosmography": "This divine realm was located on [[Amoria]], the first layer of the [[plane]] of [[Elysium]]. Another of her pantheon's members, [[Seker]], also kept his mobile realm of [[Ro Stau]] adjacent to Quietude most of the time.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "Throughout the arid plains of Quietude were thick [[grass]]es, tall reeds, sturdy [[palm tree]]s including [[date|date palms]], and [[fig|fig trees]]. Small lanterns hung on many of these trees, full of [[firefly|fireflies]], lighting the shores of the realm and providing an ethereal glow to the smooth surface of the River Serenity.\n\n[[Moon dog]] servitors roamed the plane, unleashing piercing howls to warn of unwanted intruders."
        },
        "Notable Locations": "A single small town stood in the realm alongside the River Serenity, consisting of white stucco buildings, in which lived all of Isis's petitioners. There was also a temple to Isis in the village which, unbeknownst to most, contained a [[portal]] to the plane of [[Heliopolis]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The petitioners of this realm were all either married couples or [[wizard]]s in life. Together they worked collectively towards gaining a better understanding of the [[multiverse]] and the vast secrets it contained. The wizards freely gifted their knowledge and [[spell key]]s to wizards that were [[good]]-aligned, in exchange for a simple task or some other magical knowledge. They would never gift to [[evil]] wizards and any who tried to steal a spell key would find it either didn't work or backfired. [[Neutral]] mages could purchase these things, but had to convince the seller that they wouldn't use them for evil purposes.\n\nWhen the petitioners were not working towards these goals they tilled the fields of their village, weaved reeds into a variety of items, including clothes and mats, or harvested fruit from the trees. Overall their lives hadd most simple needs met, though their only metal equipment was [[bronze]].\n\nThe people of this realm had little contact with the other layers of Elysium. But they were courteous to outsiders, especially to good-aligned mages, and held marriage in high esteem. Because of the latter, they customarily requested unmarried couples to sleep seperately and provided seperate accomodations for mixed-gender [[adventurer|adventuring bands]]. This wasn't strictly enforced by the villagers, but they quietly disapproved of anyone who disobeyed it. Additionally, it was considered customary to ask for permission to use the ''holy water'' of the River Serenity.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* Isis herself was found here whenever she was not attending to her duties in her other divine realm on Heliopolis.\n* [[Sirian Goodwife]], a [[proxy]] of Isis, lived in the village and kept the peace."
