Phlegethon was the third layer of Pandemonium. and Ibrandul, and was one of the locations of the Unseelie Court in some versions of the Great Wheel cosmology.
Unlike the other layers of Pandemonium, Phlegethons gravity was normally oriented. This trait, together with the humidity of the place, created vast and complex limestone stalagmite and stalactite formations that were constantly battered by the incessant winds. The tunnels were dominated by the sound of wind mixed with dripping water.
The darkness that permeated the entire plane was also stronger in Phlegethon, and the layer was considerably colder than the rest of the plane. The rocks in its tunnel walls absorbed light and radiative heat, both natural and magic, so all light sources within the layer only shone at half capacity. Even darkvision was impaired within the layer.
Rumors existed of overgrown dragons making their lairs throughout the layer. They seemed to be reinforced by the large bounties of treasure that adventurers sometimes stumbled upon while visiting the caverns.
* Hidden Betrayal, realm of Diirinka.
* Ibrandyllaran, realm of Ibrandul
* The Unseelie Court, realm of the Queen of Air and Darkness outside of the Feywild.
* Windglum, a town located in one of the largest caverns, and whose inhabitants were wary and suspicious of all travelers. Its largest tavern, the Scaly Dog inn, was a common meeting place for visitors.
The layer was said to be inhabited by large ferocious creatures such as albino cave wolves, giant crayfish, and enormous oozes. The Unseelie fey who inhabited the Court entirely focused their efforts into overthrowing the Seelie Court, also by judging whether captured visitors could prove useful to their cause.
