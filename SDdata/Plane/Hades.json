        "mainbody": "e three layers of Hades were called ''glooms'' for good reason; they were realms devoid of emotion, hope, and peace. Gray land and gray sky throughout, with no sun, moon or seasons to break the monotony. Any color other than shades of gray would be obvious against the background but would fade to gray in a week or two. And like bright colors, beings would begin to fade also. At first they would feel the drain of emotions leaving only sadness, ennui, and defeatism. In a [[tenday]] or two they would be trapped in Hades and their existence would begin to fade until finally they became [[Soul larva|larvae]].\n\nHades was a unique plane, as described by the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model, because it not only joined to adjacent planes in the Great Wheel, it also held the foundation of [[Mount Olympus]] and the roots of [[Yggdrasil]] the World Ash. These two planar artifacts connected Hades to [[Olympus]], in the [[Arvandor (layer)|first layer]] of [[Arborea]], and [[Ysgard]] respectively, allowing travel between Hades, the [[Upper planes]], and Alternate [[Prime Material Plane]]s without going through the [[Astral Plane]], much like the [[World Tree]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]].\n\n===Oinos===\n{{/Imagemap}}\n{{Main|Oinos}}\nThe first layer of Hades was named for the lord of the daemons (the [[Oinodaemon]]), [[Anthraxus]] the Decayed. Oinos was the land of disease with stunted and withered plants amid gray rocky terrain. The river [[Styx]] flowed through this layer and there were portals to [[Tarterus]], [[Gehenna]], and [[Concordant Opposition]] that looked like huge spinning metal coins, visible for miles, often guarded by iron fortresses. Anyone walking this land or floating on the river Styx had a chance of contracting a major disease. Many of the daemons and some of the other creatures from the lower middle planes who were immune to disease made their home here.\n\n===Niflheim===\n{{Main|Niflheim}}\nCompared to Oinos, the terrain in the second layer was rougher, like foothills, with cooler temperatures, healthier vegetation including pine trees, and no disease. Everything was cloaked in dreary fog and mist, limiting vision to about a hundred feet (thirty meters). [[Yggdrasil]]'s roots reached Niflheim, connecting it to [[Gladsheim#Asgard|Asgard]] in [[Gladsheim]].\n\n===Pluton===\n{{Main|Pluton}}\nThe lowest level of Hades contained the base of [[Mount Olympus]], a direct conduit through the [[Astral Plane]] to the plane of [[Arborea]]. The gray motif continued throughout this layer but most of the vegetation was black willow trees and dry, dying poplars.",

        "Inhabitants": "* [[Abbathor]], the dwarven Great Master of Greed had a realm in Hades called the ''[[Glitterhell]]'' because it was lined with gold that sparkled even in the gloom.\n* [[Anthraxus]] the Decayed was the most powerful daemon in the [[Lower Planes]], occupying his mighty fortress the [[Khin-Oin]], or Wasting Tower&mdash;a twenty mile (32 km) high citadel with dungeons that went just as deep underground.\n* [[Cegilune]], the goddess of the [[hag]]s, kept her realm of [[Hagsend]] in Pluton.<ref> \n* [[Cyric]], the Dark Sun, after the [[Time of Troubles]] took over the portfolios of [[Bane]], [[Bhaal]], and [[Myrkul]] and set up a realm in Hades.\n* Hades of the [[Greek pantheon]] had a realm in Pluton where the gates were guarded by the three-headed dog Cerberus.\n* Hel from the [[Norse pantheon]] was the ruler of Niflheim where she guarded the dead.\n* [[Hecate]], the Greek interloper deity of magic and the moon, had her primary realm called [[Aeaea]] in Pluton.<ref>\n* [[Jergal]] formed his realm, [[Bone Castle]], in Oinos when he was the Lord of the Dead.<ref> He remained there as servant of Myrkul and Cyric, and became Seneschal of the Crystal Spire under Kelemvor.<ref>\n* [[Kalzareinad]], [[Draconic pantheon|draconic demigod]] of evil magic, resided in the Gray Waste before his demise during the Time of Troubles.<ref>\n* [[Kelemvor]] took over the realm of his predecessors in Oinos and transformed it into the [[Crystal Spire]].\n* [[Kuraulyek]], god of the [[urd]]s, hid in his realm of [[Urdsrest]] among the hills of Oinos from [[Kurtulmak]].<ref>\n* [[Mask]], the Lord of Shadows once lived here in [[Shadow Keep]], dressed in colorful clothes but also a gray cloak.\n* [[Myrkul]], Lord of Bones lived with his [[skeleton]]s, [[zombie]]s, and minor Deaths in the [[Bone Castle|Castle of Bones]].\n* [[Nergal (deity)|Nergal]] the [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric]] (and Babylonian) god of the dead ruled a large part of Oinos from his circular city of seven concentric domes, [[Nergaltos]].
