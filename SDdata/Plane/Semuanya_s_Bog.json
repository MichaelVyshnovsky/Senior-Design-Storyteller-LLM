        "mainbody": "Semuanyas Bog was the divine realm of the lizardfolk deity known as Semuanya.\nThis realm was a dismal swamp located on the far shores of the lake Tir fo Thuinn in the Outlands. The River Maat flowed out from it.\nAmbran the Seeker, a half-elven paladin of Oghma from Cormyr, was sent on a mission to explore the planes of existence, according to his unpublished journal that dated from during the reign of King Azoun Obarskyr IV. Traveling with Glin, a bariaur guide hired to take him out from Sigil and through the Outlands, the two passed by Semuanyas Bog as they made their way to the gate-town known as Ribcage.\nThis realm was largely inhabited by lizardfolk, as well as some natural animals. Though some independently minded planars and desperate outlaws also had homes in this swamp.\nSome claimed that dinosaurs could be found living inside the swamp."
