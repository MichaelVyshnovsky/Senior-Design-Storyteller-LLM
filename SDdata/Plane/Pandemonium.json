        "mainbody": "ndemonium was made entirely of rock pierced by innumerable tunnels and caverns large and small. All open space was filled with howling winds that carried the sound of every word, shout, or scream uttered in the place. Without adequate protection, beings with hearing were rendered temporarily [[deaf]] in a matter of seconds and permanently deaf in a few minutes. Normal fires could not survive and there was no natural light. Conversation could only be accomplished by shouting at close range.\n\nGravity in Pandemonium always pulled away from the center of any cavern so a traveler could walk on the floor, walls, or ceiling. Streams and rivers would flow along one surface of a cave, or inexplicably down the middle through the air. The larger caverns were hundreds to thousands of miles/kilometers deep, wide, and tall, and the winds there could lift up small [[humanoid]]s and carry them far away before a dangerous landing.\n\nPandemonium had four known layers, each with slightly different conditions:\n\n===Pandesmos===\n{{/Imagemap}}\n{{Main|Pandesmos}}\nThe topmost layer with portals to [[Limbo]], the [[Abyss]], and [[Concordant Opposition]] was called Pandesmos and was the most habitable layer of the four. This layer had the largest caverns and the river [[Styx]] flowed through the rocky wastes. Nearly all great cities and citadels in Pandemonium were found here.\n\n===Cocytus===\n{{Main|Cocytus}}\nThe second layer was called the layer of lamentation because the wind whistling through the tunnels carried the cries of anguish and the sounds of sorrow. The passages on this level were narrower making the noise shrill enough to drive ''insane'' anyone with unprotected hearing. Unlike the natural looking tunnels and caves of Pandesmos, the passages of Cocytus were carved by beings unknown to even the gods.\n\n===Phlegethon===\n{{Main|Phlegethon}}\nThe third layer was the layer of dark and damp. The walls were matte black and absorbed all light with no reflection&mdash;all light sources could only illuminate half as far as normal. Many rivers and streams cut through the black rock and the constant dripping of eons built up stalactites, stalagmites, and other cave formations.\n\n===Agathion===\n{{Main|Agathion (layer)}}\nAgathion ({{Pronounce|a|GAY|thee|on|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}}}) was the deepest known layer of Pandemonium and was made of solid rock with no tunnels and only giant spherical bubbles of air or vacuum. Those bubbles with a barrier to Phlegethon were filled with huge windstorms capable of flinging even large humanoids around. Pockets without a connection to the next level were often the final resting places of things that should not be awakened.",
