Amoria was the first, or topmost, layer of Elysium. It was one of the most welcoming places of the Outer Planes and the marshaling center for the forces of the guardinals.
The layer had an extremely mild climate, with only modest differences between seasons. Its rolling meadows and woodlands hosted an enormous variety of wildlife and birds. All colors and sounds appeared deeper and more intense.
Most of the layers towns were located along the banks of the Oceanus, which was intensively used as a route of transportation and trade. Amoria was the last layer visited by the river before it continued on to the Beastlands.
Yggdrasil, the World Ash, extended its branches to this layer, as well as all other layers of Elysium, except Belierin.
* The City of the Star, realm of Ishtar.
* The Healing Glade, realm of Naralis Analor, the elven Watcher of Souls.
* Principality, a heavily populated divine realm of nature and peace that was not claimed by any deity.
* Quietude, realm of Isis.
* Ro Stau, realm of Seker, appeared as a grandiose high-columned palace of marble surrounded by desert when it manifested here.
* Succor, realm of Hathor
* Tethridar, combined realm of Seldarine members Kirith Sotheril, the Magess, and Tethrin Verald√©, the Master of Blades.
The layer was inhabited by the leaders of the guardinals, who used the layer as a base from which to direct their forces against evil, including sending rescue missions to the Lower planes to recover captives of evil beings.
