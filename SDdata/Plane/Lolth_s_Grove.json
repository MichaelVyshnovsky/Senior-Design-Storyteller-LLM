Presumably her realm was called \"Araushnee's Grove\" while she was residing there, but only the name \"Lolth's Grove\" is mentioned in the sources. was the devastated former [[divine realm]] of [[Lolth]] within [[Arvandor]], the joint realm of the [[Seldarine]] on [[Arborea]]'s first layer.",
        "Description": "Lolth's Grove was a shadow of its former glory. The trees of the grove, once shining in silver bark in autumn atmosphere, were blackened, uprooted, or broken down. A spring at the center was left fouled and muddy.\n\nLolth's Grove was avoided by all animals except [[spider]]s, often of enormous size, and dominated by oppressive silence. It also was haunted by many [[banshee]]s, the [[undead]] remains of Lolth's slain followers.",
        "Connections": "Lolth's Grove was bordered on the north by the [[Highhunt River]] and the flow of [[Lolth's Tears]], on the east. Arvandor's portal to the [[Outlands]] [[gate-town]] of [[Sylvania]] was located just outside of the grove.",
        "History": "The Grove was the seat of the [[elf|elven]] [[deity]] Araushnee for millennia. When she betrayed her consort [[Corellon]] by instigating the [[War of the Seldarine]], she was banished to the [[Abyss]], many of her followers were slain and her realm was left ruined."
