Presumably her realm was called \"Araushnees Grove\" while she was residing there, but only the name \"Lolths Grove\" is mentioned in the sources. was the devastated former divine realm of Lolth within Arvandor, the joint realm of the Seldarine on Arboreas first layer.\nLolths Grove was a shadow of its former glory. The trees of the grove, once shining in silver bark in autumn atmosphere, were blackened, uprooted, or broken down. A spring at the center was left fouled and muddy.\nLolths Grove was avoided by all animals except spiders, often of enormous size, and dominated by oppressive silence. It also was haunted by many banshees, the undead remains of Lolths slain followers.\nLolths Grove was bordered on the north by the Highhunt River and the flow of Lolths Tears, on the east. Arvandors portal to the Outlands gate-town of Sylvania was located just outside of the grove.\nThe Grove was the seat of the elven deity Araushnee for millennia. When she betrayed her consort Corellon by instigating the War of the Seldarine, she was banished to the Abyss, many of her followers were slain and her realm was left ruined."
