Eronia was the second layer of Elysium. A rugged and mountainous land of strong winds, it contained the divine realms of Chauntea, Eldath, Hiatea, Lathander, Mystra, and Urogalan, as well as the shared realm of Enlil and Ki, according to the Great Wheel cosmology.
The layer was marked by a rising landscape, with steep hills and mountains that rose beyond brightly lit clouds from deep valleys of white granite. At the bottom of the valleys, the River Oceanus flowed in a winding pattern, cutting canyons and gorges and flowing in rapids and extremely tall cascades. Eronia was the most dangerous section of the Oceanuss course, and could only be successfully negotiated by experienced navigators, who called themselves "river rats".
Unlike Amoria, Eronia had a much larger variability in the seasons, with harsher winters and hotter summers than the typical temperate regions of Prime Material plane worlds. Windy snow and lightning storms were common.
The wind was so strong throughout the layer that flying creatures had their maneuverability in the air considerably impaired.
Yggdrasil, the World Ash, extended its branches to this layer, as well as all other layers of Elysium, except Belierin.
* Dweomerheart, realm of Mystra.
* The Great Mothers Garden, realm of Chauntea.
* The Great Mountain of the East, realm of Enlil and Ki of the Untheric pantheon.
* Morninglory, realm of Lathander and Ushas.
* Precipice, a community of aarakocra and giant eagles built high up on the face of a steep sandstone cliff overlooking a lagoon formed by the Oceanus. It was rumored to be visited occasionally by Syranita and Remnis.
* Soulearth, realm of Urogalan.
* The True Grove, realm of Eldath.
* Woodhaven, realm of Hiatea.
Eronias inhabitants lived in small towns built atop plateaus or squeezed between the mountains and the Oceanus. The rugged geography and the inclement weather posed a constant challenge to whoever set up residence in the layer.
The Untheric deity Nanna-Sin also dwelt in Eronia, but did not have a fixed realm.
