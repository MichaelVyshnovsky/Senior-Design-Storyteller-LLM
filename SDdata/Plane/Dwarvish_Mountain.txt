The Dwarvish Mountain, sometimes known as the Dwarven Mountain, was a subterranean realm in the Outlands. It was the shared divine realm of Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, and Vergadain, according to the Great Wheel cosmology.
The outside of the mountain, which was not considered part of the realm itself, was a dangerous and icy slope where few people ventured. The only settlement on the mountain was the human town of Ironridge, located next to the entrance to Vergadains realm. It had a population of about 500 people, who traded with the realms inhabitants and occasionally sought entrance to its halls.
The underground realm epitomized the three greatest passions of the dwarven lifestyle exploration, hard work, and revelry. Each aspect was most clearly manifest in its respective realm, with all three combined to provide its dwarf inhabitants with utmost happiness.
A portal in the city of Berronars Side connected the realm of Erackinor in Solania to the Dwarvish Mountain.
