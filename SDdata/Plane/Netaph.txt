'''Netaph''' was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic]] and [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity]] of conflict and war, [[Anhur]].

==Cosmology==
Under the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], this divine realm was within the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]], on the layer of [[Ysgard (layer)|Asgard]].''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' calls Anhur a "Lesser Power of Arcadia", where some other prominent [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi deities]] reside, but which does not fit his alignment. His domain is stated to be on the [[Ysgard (layer)|layer of Ysgard]], suggesting he comes from the plane of [[Ysgard]]. This is confirmed by the sourcebook ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]''. It encompassed an [[earthmote|earthberg]] that was shared with [[Merratet]], the divine realm of [[Bast]],

Under the [[World Tree cosmology]], Netaph was said to be part of [[Heliopolis]], a [[Neutral Planes|neutral plane]] that was shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon. There it stood between a dry, barren desert and the fertile valley of [[Succor]].
===Planar Traits===
Within this realm a great deal of old forms of [[magic]] thrived, Many of these forms of magic were long since forgotten, lost to sages of the planes. In addition, all [[schools of magic]] were enhanced on Netaph.

==Geography==
Netaph was a cool and temperate land, dotted with adobe and narrow canyons.
===Flora & Fauna===
This realm was known for its birds of prey, which included domesticated [[eagle]]s, [[falcon]]s, and [[owl]]s. These birds often flew in circles, awaiting a moment to strike.

==Notable Locations==
* In the World Tree conception of this realm, Anhur was said to live within a grand temple-palace at its very center.

==Inhabitants==
Unlike petitioners elsewhere in the plane of Ysgard, those of Netaph did not wage war against one another. Instead they regularly traveled to and stormed the [[Abyss]], the [[Hades|Gray Waste of Hades]], and elsewhere in the [[Lower Planes]] to wage war upon the forces of [[evil]].

The only equipment and weapons these petitioners had was ancient, but it was quite durable and finely crafted. These included such things as [[chariot]]s. The [[spell]]s and weapons wielded by these petitioners were said to be unlike anything seen before by the [[fiend]]s they fought. And their arrival was almost always preced by thick flocks of birds of prey, so dense that they could darken the sky for miles in every direction.
