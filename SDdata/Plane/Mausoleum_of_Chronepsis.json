        "mainbody": "The '''Mausoleum of Chronepsis''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Chronepsis]], the [[dragon]] [[deity]] of fate.",
        "Description": "This realm was a great cavern, with the ruins of what looked to be a once mighty city standing above it. Within the cavern itself, there were a variety of [[hourglass]]es scattered about. According to dragon theology, these measured the life of every dragon throughout the [[multiverse]], as well as every other creature that was considered a member of [[dragonkind]].",
        "Cosmography": {
            "Planar Traits": "Reflections were incapable of being present while in this realm, even from the smoothest of water."
        },
        "History": "During the reign of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], a [[half-elven]] [[paladin]] of [[Oghma]] from [[Cormyr]] was dispatched on a mission to explore the [[planes of existence]] beyond [[Toril]]. The paladin's name was [[Ambran|Ambran the Seeker]], and excerpts from his journal still survived to the [[Present Age]]. In volume 7, Ambran described how he hired a [[bariaur]] guide named [[Glin]] to take him from [[Sigil]] to the Outlands.<ref>{{Cite dragon/204/The Plane Truth Part II: A Journey to the Outlands|31}}\n\nIn his last journal, Ambran described having spent some indeterminate amount of time in the Mausoleum, having lost sense of how long he had spent there. Glin impatiently urged the paladin for the two of them to leave, worried that Chronepsis might soon tire of their presence, and though he felt a pang of reluctance Ambran agreed. On the following day, he wonders in his journal if the dragon god had even truly been aware of their presence in his realm.{{Cite dragon/204/The Plane Truth Part II: A Journey to the Outlands|51}}",
        "Inhabitants": "This realm was devoid of any living inhabitants or [[petitioner]]s, being home to only Chronepsis.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that the Mausoleum existed simultaneously on the Outlands, the [[Negative Material plane]], and the [[Demiplane of Shadow]]. While others would tell of it being the same structure as the [[Mausoleum of Pain]], divine realm of [[Faluzure]] in [[Carceri]], and somehow coexisting on both [[planes of existence]]."
