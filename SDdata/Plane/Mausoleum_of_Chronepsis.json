        "mainbody": "The Mausoleum of Chronepsis was the divine realm of Chronepsis, the dragon deity of fate.\nThis realm was a great cavern, with the ruins of what looked to be a once mighty city standing above it. Within the cavern itself, there were a variety of hourglasses scattered about. According to dragon theology, these measured the life of every dragon throughout the multiverse, as well as every other creature that was considered a member of dragonkind.\nThis divine realm was situated in the Outlands, near the Dwarvish Mountain.\nReflections were incapable of being present while in this realm, even from the smoothest of water.\nDuring the reign of King Azoun Obarskyr IV, a half-elven paladin of Oghma from Cormyr was dispatched on a mission to explore the planes of existence beyond Toril. The paladins name was Ambran the Seeker, and excerpts from his journal still survived to the Present Age. In volume 7, Ambran described how he hired a bariaur guide named Glin to take him from Sigil to the Outlands.\nIn his last journal, Ambran described having spent some indeterminate amount of time in the Mausoleum, having lost sense of how long he had spent there. Glin impatiently urged the paladin for the two of them to leave, worried that Chronepsis might soon tire of their presence, and though he felt a pang of reluctance Ambran agreed. On the following day, he wonders in his journal if the dragon god had even truly been aware of their presence in his realm.\nThis realm was devoid of any living inhabitants or petitioners, being home to only Chronepsis.\nSome claimed that the Mausoleum existed simultaneously on the Outlands, the Negative Material plane, and the Demiplane of Shadow. While others would tell of it being the same structure as the Mausoleum of Pain, divine realm of Faluzure in Carceri, and somehow coexisting on both planes of existence."
