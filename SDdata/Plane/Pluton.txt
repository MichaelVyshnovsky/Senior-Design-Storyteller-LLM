Pluton, also called Olympians Gloom, was the third layer, also called third gloom, of Hades in the Great Wheel cosmology and an astral dominion in the World Axis cosmology.
Pluton was not as cold as Niflheim but still a cool place. However, its vegetation was that of a subtropical place, It was believed that these trees had petitioners inside them and druids could feel the trees sadness.
The Blood War was not waged in Pluton but sometimes fiends came to get the soul of a particularly skilled person.
The base of Mount Olympus was located in Pluton, close to the entrance to the realm of Hades. Since it avoided the upper layers of Oinos and Niflheim, it was frequently used by travelers, despite being a dangerous and treacherous route.
Aeaea
 Hecate, the Greek interloper deity of magic and the moon, had her primary realm on Pluton.
Corpus
 Corpus was a city that was made of people. For example, streets were made of living bodies.
Hagsend
The mother of night hags, avaricious Cegilune, made her realm here. 
The Hill of Bones
 The Hill of Bones was a place where nightmares went to die. The place was sacred to them and removing a bone incurred the wrath of all nightmares who learned of the theft.
One of the legends about the origins of the Raven Queen stipulated that she was originally a sorceress who led a rebellion against a god of death who held domain in Pluton. Other deities recognized her as one of their own, but, in order to prevent her from becoming a tyrant much like the defeated deity, granted her domain over death but not the dead themselves.
