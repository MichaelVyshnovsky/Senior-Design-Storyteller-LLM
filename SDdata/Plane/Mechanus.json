        "History": "[[File:Modrons-mechanus-5e.jpg|thumb|230px|''Adventurers hiding from the Great [[Modron]] March departing from Mechanus.'']]\nAfter [[Orcus]] killed Primus and triggered an unexpected [[Great Modron March]], he left the [[Energy Pool]] in [[Regulus]] to search for the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]'', leaving the way open for a [[secundus]] to be promoted into the new Primus. However, prolonged contact with the Pool caused Orcus's [[evil]] influence to taint a fraction of the modrons. One tainted secundus disputed the ascension of any one of the other three and rebelled, leaving Mechanus and taking almost a million modrons with him. The dissidents settled a modron colony in [[Acheron]], where they regrouped to later attempt to retake the plane. This schism crippled the modron race and paved the way for a [[formian]] invasion of Mechanus.{{Cite dragon/354/Return of the Modrons|36}}\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[wild mage]] [[Delina]] was sent to Mechanus by [[Martikay]] in order to search for a way to cure her from her wild magic surges. After interacting with several modrons, she was brought to trial by the [[Fraternity of Order]] at Regulus under charges of being an agent of chaos. She was found guilty and summarily sentenced to exile from the plane. The experience allowed Delina to better understand, rather than control, her wild magic.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3}}"
