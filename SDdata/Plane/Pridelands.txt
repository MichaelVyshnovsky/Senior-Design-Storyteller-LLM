The '''Pridelands''' were the [[divine realm]] of [[Nobanion]], the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian deity]] of [[lion]]s and other [[cat|felines]].

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], this realm was located in [[Krigala]], the daylit first layer of the [[plane]] known as the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]]. While in the [[World Tree cosmology]], the Pridelands were situated in the [[House of Nature]] alongside the divine realms of other nature deities.

==Description==
The Pridelands were said to be a vast savannah, dotted by groves of trees. Amidst one of these groves of trees was a permanent ''[[portal]]'' that connected the realm to [[Gulthmere Forest]] on [[Toril]].

==History==
The Pridelands were created in the aftermath of the [[Godswar]], with Nobanion having created the permanent ''portal'' that connected the divine realm to his longstanding territory on the [[Prime Material]], Gulthmere Forest.

==Inhabitants==
This divine realm was primarily inhabited by members of Nobanion's Great Pride, [[lammasu]] and [[wemic]]s, as well as his [[petitioner]]s. Like other divine realms in the House of Nature, Nobanion's [[humanoid]] petitioners would gradually take on animal traits, particularly those of felines. And over the course of centuries, they would transform into [[celestial creature|celestial animals]]. The sole exception to this were Nobanion's wemic petitioners, who maintained their mortal forms indefinitely.
