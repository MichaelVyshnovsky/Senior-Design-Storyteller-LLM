        "Geography": "Unlike the other layers of Pandemonium, Phlegethon's gravity was normally oriented. This trait, together with the humidity of the place, created vast and complex [[limestone]] stalagmite and stalactite formations that were constantly battered by the incessant winds. The tunnels were dominated by the sound of wind mixed with dripping water.\n\nThe darkness that permeated the entire plane was also stronger in Phlegethon, and the layer was considerably colder than the rest of the plane. The rocks in its tunnel walls absorbed light and radiative heat, both natural and magic, so all light sources within the layer only shone at half capacity. Even [[darkvision]] was impaired within the layer.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rumors existed of overgrown [[dragon]]s making their lairs throughout the layer. They seemed to be reinforced by the large bounties of treasure that adventurers sometimes stumbled upon while visiting the caverns.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Hidden Betrayal]], realm of [[Diirinka]].\n* [[Ibrandyllaran]], realm of [[Ibrandul]]\n* The [[Unseelie Court]], realm of the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]] outside of the [[Feywild]].\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = 300px\n| source = [[Wilfin Strabile]]\n| text   = Welcome to Windglum. When are you leaving?\n}}\n* [[Windglum]], a town located in one of the largest caverns, and whose inhabitants were wary and suspicious of all travelers. Its largest tavern, the [[Scaly Dog]] inn, was a common meeting place for visitors.",
        "Inhabitants": "The layer was said to be inhabited by large ferocious creatures such as albino cave [[wolf|wolves]], [[giant crayfish]], and enormous [[ooze]]s. The Unseelie [[fey]] who inhabited the Court entirely focused their efforts into overthrowing the [[Seelie Court]], also by judging whether captured visitors could prove useful to their cause."
