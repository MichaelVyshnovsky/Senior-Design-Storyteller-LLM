The '''Blessed Fields of Elysium''' ({{Pronounce|e|LIS|ee|um|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] plane embodying the concept of pure good without being overly restricted by law nor dissipated by the randomness of chaos. Some characteristics of this plane were ascribed to [[Heliopolis]] and the [[House of Nature]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]] model when that cosmology became popular. Heliopolis was essentially destroyed in the [[Spellplague]] and the House of Nature split into at least two parts, one of which became the [[Deep Wilds]] and the other merged with the [[Green Fields]] as described by the [[World Axis cosmology]] model.

==Description==
Most features of the four layers of Elysium were found on or near the banks of the river [[Oceanus]] which linked the plane with two other [[Upper planes]]: the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and [[Arborea]]. Oceanus was the counterpart to the river [[Styx]] which flowed through the [[Lower planes]] except that Oceanus had only natural hazards and contained potable water. Lands near the riverbanks were lush with pines and flowering trees that filled the air with natural [[perfume]]. Farther from the river smaller trees grew and started to thin until finally, after hundreds of miles/kilometers, the forest gave way to fertile veldt regions, vast grasslands, and eventually badlands and desert.

There were no suns, moons, or stars in Elysium except those that the inhabiting Powers manifested, created by moving about in various vessels, or moving their entire realms across the skies. Depending on who or what was aloft, the shade of the sky could be deep indigo to a bright cerulean at any given moment.

[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash, extended its branches to all layers of Elysium, except [[Belierin]].

===Amoria===
{{/Imagemap}}
{{Main|Amoria}}
The first layer, Amoria, also referred to as the "innermost" layer, was connected to the [[Astral Plane]] by ''color pools'' and to [[Twin Paradises]], [[Happy Hunting Grounds]], and [[Concordant Opposition]] by unmarked portals located in dark caverns. ''[[Divination]]'' spells were required to determine the destination of these portals with certainty. Navigating the river [[Oceanus]] downstream also led to the Happy Hunting Grounds but any underground passages were not likely to be safe for boats. Amoria best fit the description given above and the river Oceanus had many side channels that split and merged back again, creating many "banks" for the establishment of realms.

===Eronia===
{{Main|Eronia}}
The second layer of Elysium was very mountainous and many branches of the Oceanus became spectacular waterfalls and tumbling cascades before forming channels bordered by steep cliffs of gray rock. Like Amoria, Eronia supported abundant wildlife along the banks.

===Belierin===
{{Main|Belierin}}
Contrary to Eronia, Belierin was mostly flat with marshes and wetlands stretching inland for miles/kilometers before larger plants and trees were found. Oceanus split and formed many island nations inhabited by extraplanar beings.

===Thalasia===
{{Main|Thalasia}}
The fourth and "outermost" layer of Elysium was a great ocean, sometimes called the Thalasian sea, that was both the source and final destination of the River [[Oceanus]]. Small, green islands were scattered about, collectively known as [[Avalon]]. No big land masses existed here.

==Inhabitants==

The native celestial population of Elysium were the [[guardinal]]s. In addition, there were myriad species of fish and wildlife, and other sentient beings who chose to live in Elysium were many of those species found in other [[Upper planes]]: [[hollyphant]]s, [[planetar]]s, [[solar]]s, [[foo creature]]s, [[agathia]], and [[baku]]. [[Moon dog]]s were numerous and widely used as servants and watchbeasts for the [[Greater deity|Greater]] and [[Lesser deity|Lesser]] Powers of Elysium.

==Afterlife==
{{Main|Afterlife}}
The spirits of those who perished in the service of good and those heroes the gods chose to spare from death were rewarded by being placed on the Isles of the Blessed in Thalasia. There, the living and the dead existed without responsibilities, had all their needs provided for, and could not be summoned or controlled.
