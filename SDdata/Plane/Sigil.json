        "mainbody": "The population of Sigil spoke in a characteristic slang known as the [[cant (Sigil)|cant]] that often confused newcomers. They tended to hold inhabitants of the Material Plane in contempt, referring to them as \"Clueless\", \"Outsiders\", or, more politely, \"primes\". Despite their banter, Cagers―and planars in general―held a cautious respect for primes, since they acknowledged that a certain amount of power was necessary to reach Sigil from the Material Plane.\n\nBefore the Faction War, Sigil was home to 15 extraplanar factions that struggled with one another for power and prestige but generally did not engage in open conflict. The Lady of Pain tolerated the existence of these factions, so long as they did not interfere with her or her nebulous goals. Several factions even served useful purposes, such as the [[Guvners]], the [[Harmonium]], and the [[Mercykillers]], which served as the judges, jury, and executioners of Sigil, respectively.\n\n[[File:rhys in sigil-5e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Guildmaster Rhys in Sigil overseeing in dismay the training of new recruits.'']]\nFollowing the Faction War, other organizations took over administrative roles in the city. An Advisory Council was formed by prominent citizens to keep the peace, often hiring adventurers to deal with threats. It was led by [[Rhys]], former leader of the [[Transcendent Order]]. The role of jailers was assumed by a group known as the [[Sons of Mercy]], founded by a former member of the Mercykillers. Trade was regulated by the Mutual Trade Association, formed by guild leaders and led by [[Shemeshka]].\n\nThe city did not have a lustrous vegetation, and its only park had been overrun with squatters. The only remaining plant life was [[razorvine]], a rapidly growing plant that originated in the [[Lower planes]] and was considered a hazard. The darker alleys were crowded with [[rat]]s and [[cranium rat]]s, [[rot grub]]s grew on garbage heaps, and [[bat]]s nested on higher places. The city's underground was inhabited by [[wererat]]s. The city also had two native species of birds: [[pigeon]]s with a gray-green coloration and large [[raven]]s with gray bodies and black heads and wings, known as [[executioner's raven]]s.\n\n===Notable Inhabitants===\n* [[Saddam Hasan ibn Arvalas]], a [[wizard]] from Toril and former pupil of [[Trobriand]].

        "Description": "{{quote|This city has more political intrigue than [[Waterdeep]], the people are more arrogant than [[Westgate]] merchants, and the air's more foul than a [[Zhentil Keep]] sewer.|[[Joel|Joel of Finder]]}}\nSigil was located in the Outlands, hovering above the immensely tall landmark known as the [[Spire]] that stood at the plane's center.\n\nSigil was shaped like the inside of a torus. According to official measurements by the [[Harmonium]], the city's primary diameter―that is, the ring's diameter―was {{SI|5|mi|k|long=yes}}, with a circumference of {{SI|20|mi|k|long=yes}}.The Harmonium's measurements are inconsistent with the ratio between a circle's radius and its circumference in Euclidean geometry, but could be possible in a [[wikipedia:Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic geometry]]. Later measurements put the primary diameter at approximately {{SI|6.4|mi|k|long=yes}}, with the same circumference as the Harmonium's measurements, and a secondary diameter―the ring's thickness―of approximately {{SI|1.5|mi|k|long=yes}}. Despite these attempts at measurement, the city did not have a fixed size and its dimensions could be changed at will by the [[Lady of Pain]].\n\n[[File:Outlands2e.png|thumb|left|230px|''A view of the [[Spire]] and Sigil from the [[Outlands]].'']]\nThe city's location and geometry was considered by most sages, in particular the inhabitants of the Material Plane, to be impossible. Although all [[magic]] was completely impeded at the center of the Outlands, with the exception of spells that involved planar travel. There were many hypotheses that tried to explain Sigil's location and existence. Although they varied wildly, one of the more popular explanations posited that the Lady of Pain was behind the city's existence and properties.\n\nThe city did not fill the entire inner surface of the torus, but just the outer portion of the ring. For that reason, the city was recursive only in one direction, along its major circumference. Even though it was not a completely closed surface, it was impossible to see outside of the ring from any point within the city. If one looked up, the far side was visible, as the gentle curvature caused any point in the city to resemble the bottom of a valley. The edges of the ring were lined with solid buildings that had no windows outside, so the only way to try to see what lay beyond the edge was to climb a rooftop. Those who did reported that there was nothing to see beyond the edge―not empty space or a vacuum, but nothing at all. Those who jumped over the edge disappeared into a random plane.\n\nAs a result of this unique geometry, Sigil had no sky. The city was kept lit by an intrinsic luminescence of its air, which waxed and waned creating the appearance of a 24-hour day-night cycle. The brightest moment in the cycle was referred to as \"peak\" and the darkest point was referred to as \"antipeak\". Time was measured by counting down the hours before peak ({{SmallCaps|b.p.}}) and incrementing them after peak ({{SmallCaps|a.p.}}). As a result, most of the time the city was illuminated only by a hazy twilight. The equivalent of full daylight only lasted for about 6 hours, from 3 {{SmallCaps|b.p.}} to 3 {{SmallCaps|a.p.}}, so even creatures that were sensitive to bright light were comfortable in Sigil most of the time. During the six darkest hours of the cycle, light coming from [[lantern]]s on the opposite side of the ring gave an illusion of a sky filled with stars. Clocks in Sigil did not have numbers and were marked with 24 1-hour segments, with the daytime hours and peak on top and night hours and antipeak at the bottom.\n\n[[File:Sigil-4e.jpg|thumb|250px|''A [[dragonborn]] appreciating the architecture of the City of Doors.'']]\nThe city was crowded with buildings that squeezed over each other with very small living spaces. New buildings, courtyards, and streets were constantly being built, changing the city's landscape and turning old structures into underground crypts. Sigil's architecture was marked by its iron spikes and bladed fences, serving both as protection against intruders and as a stylistic choice. Stone gargoyles were also typical decorations.\n\nWeather on Sigil alternated between foul-smelling smog, frequent chilly rains, and somewhat clear weather. The haze from the city's myriad chimneys was a near constant, often reducing visibility to about {{SI|10|yd|long=yes}}, or even down to {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in the worst cases. When it rained, it was common for the water to mix with the walls' and the air's impurities and turn to a brown drizzle. After it rained, the city air cleared out for a while, with light breezes and a pleasant cool temperature.",
        "Cosmography": "According to its own inhabitants, Sigil's central position in the Outlands, at equal distance from the each of the [[gate-town]]s that led to the [[Outer Planes]], put the city itself at the center of the planes, at least according to some interpretations of the Great Wheel cosmology. Most sages agreed that, since the multiverse was infinite, there was no true center, but nevertheless Sigil was generally acknowledged as one of the most important places in the multiverse.\n\nIt was impossible to walk into and out of Sigil from the Outlands or any other location.\n\nThe only way in or out of Sigil was via its innumerable ''[[portals]]''. Thus, the city touched all planes at once, yet ultimately belonged to none. Those characteristics warranted Sigil the other names it was known for: it was called \"the City of Doors\" for the sheer number of ''portals'', but was also called \"the Cage\" for the difficulty to enter or exit the city.",
        "Government": "[[File:Lady of Pain 2e B.png|thumb|230px|''The Lady of Pain hovering over the streets of Sigil.'']]\nThe ruler of Sigil was the mysterious Lady of Pain, who reigned from her seat of power known as the Throne of Blades. Her power controlled all the ''portals'' in the city and prevented all [[deities]] and [[archfiend]]s from entering it. The Lady did not otherwise concern herself with ruling the city directly; she typically only interfered when something threatened the stability of Sigil itself or crossed one of her few but unforgiving edicts, which amounted to keeping the peace and refraining from worship of her.\n\nThe Lady was an entity of inscrutable motives, but she was known for being swift and merciless when dealing with threats to her and to the City of Doors. Those who crossed her, even accidentally, risked being flayed to death or teleported to extradimensional labyrinths known as the Lady's Mazes, never to be seen again. Tales also existed of would-be usurpers to the Throne of Blades who ended up imprisoned in [[Agathion]], the third layer of [[Pandemonium]].\n\nAlthough the Lady of Pain did not act directly in the everyday management of Sigil, her will was enforced through a number of servants known as [[dabus]], who simultaneously served as the Lady's eyes and ears as well as keepers of the structure of Sigil. Like the Lady, the dabus did not interact much with Sigil's inhabitants or travelers. It was considered wise to leave the dabus be, since antagonizing them incurred the risk of bringing down the infrequent but harsh wrath of their mistress.\n\n[[File:Dabus-2e.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The dabus, silent caretakers of Sigil.'']]\nThe dabus also constantly repaired and reshaped Sigil, recycling materials from one structure to build another. They were believed to be the only ones who truly understood the inner workings of the city, and some even speculated that the dabus were the true rulers of Sigil. It was believed that the dabus dwelled somewhere in the crypts in the city's underground.\n\nThanks to the Lady's strict forbiddance of open large-scale conflict, Sigil was a true neutral haven to all visitors. It was a location where no wars were waged and even the fiercest opponents, such as an [[angel]] and a [[fiend]] or a [[devil]] and a [[demon]], could be seen sharing a drink and momentarily setting their differences aside.\n\nNevertheless, Sigil was hardly peaceful; the Lady of Pain did not concern herself with day-to-day crime such as murder or petty theft. Only threats to Sigil, and, by extension, to the Lady herself, were met with direct action by her and the dabus. This lack of direct oversight and the need for personal maintenance of law and order gave visitors and Cagers the feeling that Sigil was constantly on the brink of anarchy.",

            "Services": "Services offered in Sigil included:\n\n* [[Tout]]s, or unofficial city guides. It was highly recommended that [[planewalker]]s new to Sigil employed a guide, lest they be taken advantage of or mugged. Since there as no central agency or any regulation of the profession, such guides could be little better themselves, either serving to persuade a traveler to the side of their faction or simply robbing their \"customer\" once their backs were turned.\n* [[Factotum]]s, the city's official guides. Regulated by their respective factions, they guided visitors through not only the city's mazes, but its convoluted politics as well.\n* Public transportation. Sigil had no horses, so unlike [[Waterdeep]]'s [[dray]]s and [[hire-coach]]es, its transportation system consisted of [[sedan chair]]s that could hold up to two people each. The service did not extend to the entire city, as some dangerous areas were avoided by sedan chair pullers.\n* [[Courier]]s, hired to deliver messages around the city. It was a dangerous job, so the service was not entirely reliable.\n* [[Light boy]]s, street urchins who offered escorting services via [[wand]]s of ''[[continual light]]'', since Sigil did not possess streetlights. They were familiar with many of the city's intricacies, so they could act as unofficial guides as well."

        "History": "Sigil's origins were unknown and clouded in mystery and legend. Some speculated that the city had been built by the Lady of Pain herself,\n\nIn its distant past, the city was administered by guilds, with over fifty warring factions wrestling with each other for power and control. In the event known as the [[Great Upheaval]], the Lady of Pain limited the number of official factions to fifteen, handing control of the city to the factions instead of the guilds. This new arrangement lasted for six centuries.\n\nDuring the period in which control of Sigil was in the hands of factions, the years were measured from the beginning of the rule of certain factions' leaders (known as \"factols\"), typically those of the [[Fraternity of Order]]. Local inhabitants were accustomed to the constant changes in the city, so they did not pay too much attention to the timing of historic events.\n\nAt an unknown time, a plot to free [[Malar]] from his imprisonment by [[Talos]] in the [[Land of the Hunt]] in the [[Colothys]] layer of [[Carceri]] resulted in an artifact known as the ''[[dreamlink]]'' spreading a corruption of the wild nature of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] into several Outer Planes and into Sigil itself. The effects, which included intense increases in aggressiveness from animals and other creatures, threatened to spread from there to the entire multiverse.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = This city tolerates your faction no longer. Abandon it or die.\n| source = Proclamation from the Lady of Pain at the end of the Faction War\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\n632 years after the Great Upheaval, in the 130{{th}} year of Factol [[Hashkar]]'s rule, the simmering political tensions between the fifteen factions for supremacy of their worldview escalated to open hostilities, triggering a bloody internal conflict known as the [[Faction War (conflict)|Faction War]]. The war ended with the complete disbanding of all factions by the Lady of Pain, with some of them being extinguished, others moving their headquarters to other planes, and others becoming underground organizations.\n\nSome time after the Faction War, the [[lich]] [[Vecna]] attempted to ascend to the status of [[greater deity]] and orchestrated an invasion of Sigil, from where he hoped to control the entire multiverse. The Lady of Pain expelled Vecna from the city with the help of adventurers, but the invasion caused a great disturbance in the multiverse. Following his defeat, the Lady of Pain strengthened Sigil's defenses and reorganized the planar structure in order to repair the damage and to prevent such an event from ever happening again.",
