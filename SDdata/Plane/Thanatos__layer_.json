        "mainbody": "Thanatos, nicknamed the Belly of Death,The Planes of Chaos box set states that Thanatos was the 113 layer of the Abyss. layer of the Abyss, and for most of its history the dominion of Orcus, the demon prince of undeath. For a time it was the divine realm of the drow goddess Kiaransalee, who usurped the throne of Naratyr from Orcus after murdering the powerful demon lord.\nThanatos was a cold and unforgiving place that existed without a trace of life. The black sky remained in a persistent state of moonlit night, and the thin air immediately made any breathing creature weaker.\nIts corrupted landscape boasted endless decay, and its residents yearned for the opportunity to drain the life force of any non-dead entity that wandered within. Any being that did perish upon Thanatos was raised as some form of undead or lesser demon within an hours time. Only powerful spells like raise dead or wish could prevent this process.\nNecromantic magic worked especially well all across the plane, albeit with some unexpected twists. Undead that had been reanimated could be taken over by petitioners or lesser demons. The spell reincarnation always transferred an errant soul to the body of a tanarri.\nWhile it was said that nothing \"truly lived\" in Thanatos, there was sparse plant life that grew throughout the undead realm. Various species of fungi, mold, and mosses could be found in the less-frigid locales across its bleak landscape.\nDespite the utter desolation and horror encountered across much of Thanatos, its two cities were not without some semblance of society found in the lands of the living. A few number of establishments including shops were supported by the rudimentary form of commerce that sprang up within. Similarly, different factions of undead plotted against each other to vie for power and the attention of Thanatos ruler.\nAs in other layers of the Abyss, the River Styx passed across the blighted lands of Thanatos. \nThanatos was accessible by portal found within the graveyard of Sigil.\n* Forbidden Citadel, the \"summer realm\" of Thanatos, kept warm by a series of steaming geysers that spewed water into the River Styx.\n* Naratyr, the City of the Dead was the seat of power for both Orcus and Kiaransalee.\nthumb|right|350px|In Thanatos, you may not to know whether your neighbors were demons or undead. Some may be both!\nThanatos was inhabited entirely by endless hordes of undead, and ravenous demons. Notable among the fiends were countless legion of babau and armanites. \nHordes of lesser undead such as zombies, ghouls, and even wights were bound together in masses of undead flesh and drifted down the River Styx. When these clumps of undeath reached Naratyr, they were transformed into skeletal undead and wraiths, in order to better serve the Tanarri. Among the more powerful undead that served Thanatos ruler were shadowy specters and learned vampires.\nThe Dustmen of Sigil were among the more influential organizations within Thanatos. They at times worked as guides for any being that traveled to the realm. Their company was a form of protection as their clients went unmolested by most of Thanatos denizens.\nOver the course of his rule over Thanatos, Orcus achieved some form of divine status, but grew lazy and unconcerned with competition against his fellow demon lords. Planewalkers from across the multiverse began to ridicule Thanatos as a refuge for slothful undead. In his indolence, Orcus dropped his guard and was slain by the demi-goddess Kiaransalee. Kiaransalee took over as ruler of Thanatos and reshaped the realm in her image. She decreed that any likeness of Orcus or his namesake wand be stricken from the capital city of Naratyr.\nAt some point during the midâ€“14 century DR, Orcus was resurrected by his high priest Quah-Nomag. He soon reclaimed rule of Thanatos from Kiaransalee, determined to once again wage war against his enemies.\nHe remained in control of Naratyr and Thanatos as of the Second Sundering of Toril.\nThanatos was the resting place of the Book of Lies, an ancient tome that was said to list every single lie ever told.\nThe Kiaransaleen spell haunted reverie forced an elf to witness the horrors of Thanatos when they entered into their state of reverie."
