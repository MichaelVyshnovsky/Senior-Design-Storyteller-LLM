        "mainbody": "'''Thanatos''', nicknamed the '''Belly of Death''',The ''[[Planes of Chaos (boxed set)|Planes of Chaos]]'' box set states that Thanatos was the 113{{th}} layer of the Abyss. layer of [[the Abyss]], and for most of its history the dominion of [[Orcus]], the [[demon prince]] of [[undeath]]. For a time it was the [[divine realm]] of the [[drow goddess]] [[Kiaransalee]], who usurped the throne of [[Naratyr]] from Orcus after murdering the powerful [[demon lord]].",
        "Description": {
            "Magic": "[[Necromantic]] magic worked especially well all across the plane, albeit with some unexpected twists. Undead that had been ''[[animate dead|reanimated]]'' could be taken over by [[petitioner]]s or lesser [[demon]]s. The spell ''[[reincarnation]]'' always transferred an errant [[soul]] to the body of a [[tanar'ri]].",
            "Flora & Fauna": "While it was said that nothing \"truly lived\" in Thanatos, there was sparse plant life that grew throughout the undead realm. Various species of fungi, mold, and mosses could be found in the less-frigid locales across its bleak landscape."
        },
        "Culture": "Despite the utter desolation and horror encountered across much of Thanatos, its two cities were not without some semblance of society found in the lands of the living. A few number of establishments including shops were supported by the rudimentary form of commerce that sprang up within. Similarly, different factions of undead plotted against each other to vie for power and the attention of Thanatos' ruler.",
        "Cosmography": "As in other layers of the Abyss, the [[River Styx]] passed across the blighted lands of Thanatos. \n\nThanatos was accessible by ''[[portal]]'' found within the graveyard of [[Sigil]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Forbidden Citadel]], the \"summer realm\" of Thanatos, kept warm by a series of steaming geysers that spewed water into the River Styx.\n* [[Naratyr]], the City of the Dead was the seat of power for both Orcus and Kiaransalee.<ref name=\"PoC.T-p14\" >",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Organizations": "The [[Dustmen]] of [[Sigil]] were among the more influential organizations within Thanatos. They at times worked as guides for any being that traveled to the realm. Their company was a form of protection as their clients went unmolested by most of Thanatos' denizens."
        },
        "History": "Over the course of his rule over Thanatos, Orcus achieved some form of divine status,{{Cite dragon/359/1d20 Villains: D&D's Most Wanted; Preferably Dead|62}} but grew lazy and unconcerned with competition against his fellow demon lords. [[Planewalker]]s from across the [[multiverse]] began to ridicule Thanatos as a refuge for slothful undead. In his indolence, Orcus dropped his guard and was slain by the [[demi-goddess]] Kiaransalee. Kiaransalee took over as ruler of Thanatos and reshaped the realm in her image. She decreed that any likeness of Orcus or his ''[[Wand of Orcus|namesake wand]]'' be stricken from the capital city of Naratyr.\n\nAt some point during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Orcus was resurrected by his high priest [[Quah-Nomag]]. He soon reclaimed rule of Thanatos from Kiaransalee, determined to once again wage war against his enemies.\n\nHe remained in control of Naratyr and Thanatos as of the [[Second Sundering]] of [[Toril]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Thanatos was the resting place of the ''[[Book of Lies]]'', an ancient tome that was said to list every single lie ever told.\n\nThe [[:Category:Kiaransaleen spells|Kiaransaleen spell]] ''[[haunted reverie]]'' forced an elf to witness the horrors of Thanatos when they entered into their state of reverie."
