        "mainbody": "'''Colothys''', also known as '''Climbers' Doom''', was the fourth layer of [[Carceri]].",
        "Description": "The worlds of the fourth layer were spiked with colossal mountains rising above deep chasms. Hundreds of miles from base to peak, the terrain of this layer made the orbs more asymmetrical than in other layers. so they appeared to be small spiky red moons in the utterly black sky.\n\nMountains on Colothys soared hundreds of miles high and had slopes that made climbing outright impossible. The mountains sported trees, but these didn't serve as good handholds for climbers. There were nonetheless some ways to make traveling through Colothys easier. Natural plateaus served as rest places and artificial rope bridges between canyon walls (hard to use due to the wind on the layer) and the rare ledges, about {{SIAdj|1|ft|c|adj=wide}} carved into the sides of mountains, aided travel and served as trade routes, but were fought over by the inhabitants. These trade routes were created by various people but they sometimes led straight to danger.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Ellaniath]] was the divine realm of [[Vhaeraun]]. Its specifics were unknown as the god extinguished any memories of those who visited it.\n* The [[Garden of Malice]] was a type of plant found on a single orb on Colothys. It had beautiful flowers but tried to kill the people it lured to collect some of it. It spread its seeds, which were mostly eaten, thus spreading the species across Colothys.\n* The [[Land of the Hunt]] was the divine realm of [[Malar]]. It was greener than other parts of Colothys and was home to a lot of animals.\n* [[The Vault]] was a prison run by the [[Harmonium]]. It was notable for its wardens and jailors who abused their power over their charges.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Crius]] was an elder brother to [[Cronus]] and was believed to have some nefarious plans.\n* [[Malar]] was the [[lesser deity]] of hunters. He was imprisoned by [[Talos]] on Carceri.\n* [[Shandalara Wolfkin]] was on Colothys only by accident. She acted as a saboteur against Malar and allied with anybody for that end.\n* [[Vhaeraun]] was the lesser deity of thievery of the [[drow]]. He was hated by the other gods of Carceri because he wasn't a prisoner of the Red Prison."
