'''Gith and Slaad''' was described by some scholars as the first layer of [[Limbo]]. Named after its most numerous inhabitants, the [[githzerai]] and the [[slaad]]i, the layer was scarcely distinguishable from the rest of the plane.

==Description==
Like all of Limbo, Gith and Slaad was a churning storm of ever-changing matter and energy, dotted with fragments of temporarily stable landscape. The raw chaos could be manipulated and stabilized by a creature's force of will.

==Cosmography==
Most of the ''[[portal]]s'' in and out of Limbo were located in this layer, usually leading to [[Ysgard]], [[Pandemonium]], and the [[Outlands]]. They could assume any form, but were usually surrounded by slowly rotating areas of stable matter. However, these ''portals'' were highly unreliable, often leading to random locations.

The barriers separating Gith and Slaad from the other layers of Limbo were considerably weaker than in other planes, so that it was possible to find [[divine realm]]s typically associated with other layers of the plane there, as well as permanent settlements throughout the plane.{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|143}} Many scholars simply disregarded the reason for the barriers' existence, considering the entire plane one single layer.

==Notable Locations==
* The githzerai settlements of the [[Floating City]] and [[Shra'kt'lor]], home to [[Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith]], the Great Githzerai, were occasionally located in this layer as they moved through the plane.
* The realm of the [[slaad lord]] [[Ygorl]] was occasionally found in this layer as it randomly traveled throughout the plane.
