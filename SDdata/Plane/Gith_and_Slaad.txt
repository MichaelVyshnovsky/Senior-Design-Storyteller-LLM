Gith and Slaad was described by some scholars as the first layer of Limbo. Named after its most numerous inhabitants, the githzerai and the slaadi, the layer was scarcely distinguishable from the rest of the plane.
Like all of Limbo, Gith and Slaad was a churning storm of ever-changing matter and energy, dotted with fragments of temporarily stable landscape. The raw chaos could be manipulated and stabilized by a creatures force of will.
Most of the portals in and out of Limbo were located in this layer, usually leading to Ysgard, Pandemonium, and the Outlands. They could assume any form, but were usually surrounded by slowly rotating areas of stable matter. However, these portals were highly unreliable, often leading to random locations.
The barriers separating Gith and Slaad from the other layers of Limbo were considerably weaker than in other planes, so that it was possible to find divine realms typically associated with other layers of the plane there, as well as permanent settlements throughout the plane. Many scholars simply disregarded the reason for the barriers existence, considering the entire plane one single layer.
* The githzerai settlements of the Floating City and Shraktlor, home to Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the Great Githzerai, were occasionally located in this layer as they moved through the plane.
* The realm of the slaad lord Ygorl was occasionally found in this layer as it randomly traveled throughout the plane.
