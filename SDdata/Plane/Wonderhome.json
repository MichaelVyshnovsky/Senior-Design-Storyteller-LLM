        "mainbody": "Wonderhome was the divine realm of Gond, the Faerûnian god of craftsmen.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, Wonderhome was located in the Outlands, though its exact placement within that plane was uncertain.Wonderhome was never depicted on any maps of the Outlands, so its location in relation to all the other divine realms there is unknown. In the World Tree cosmology, it was located in the celestial plane known as the House of Knowledge, a plane that Gond shared with the Faerûnian deity of invention Oghma. And in the World Axis cosmology, Wonderhome was also located within the House of Knowledge, but there the latter was considered to be an astral dominion belonging to Oghma.\nA portal between this realm and the Mithral Forge, divine realm of the gnomish craftsmen deity Flandal Steelskin, was maintained by Gond.\nWonderhome was said to be a great workshop full of all manner of inventions. Some were recognizable to Faerûnians, though many more were not as they had yet to be discovered."
