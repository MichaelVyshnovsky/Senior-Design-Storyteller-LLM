        "mainbody": "he Demiplane of Nightmares was a horrific demiplane inhabited by creatures that looked like monsters out of nightmares.\nThe Demiplane of Nightmares was a strange place of strange angles and stranger geometry that seemed unsettling, even repulsive, to people from the Material plane.\nThe Demiplane of Nightmares was variously described to be either an independent demiplane in the Ethereal plane,\nCreatures known to inhabit the Demiplane of Nightmares included neh-thalggu, diaboli, feyrs, nagpas, and maelephants. Of these, only the diaboli were actually native to the demiplane. The diaboli occupied the same niche on the Demiplane of Nightmares that humans did on the Material Plane. Malferas were a native predator of the demiplane.\nThe creatures that lived in the Demiplane of Nightmares were horrific beings to the eyes of most people. It was said that they saw creatures from the Material plane in much the same way, and certainly the diaboli instinctively feared humans and other humanoids.\nIn , Netherese arcanists emigrated to the Demiplane of Nightmares, where the energies infusing the plane twisted their descendants until they evolved into the Night Parade. \nAround and prior to the year , members of the Night Parade opened portals back to the Realms, where they began infiltrating cities such as Calimport.\nSome claimed that the dark powers must have pulled part of the Demiplane of Nightmare into the Demiplane of Dread to create an even more terrifying expanse in that place.\nCategoryGreat Wheel planes\nCategoryWorld Tree planes\nCategoryDemiplanes\nCategoryPlanes of existence\nCategoryLocations in the Ethereal Plane\n8ku3wnin0u6hkakk0jh6igzqcrgp8jd"
