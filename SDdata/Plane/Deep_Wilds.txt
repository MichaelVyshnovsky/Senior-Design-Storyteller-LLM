The Deep Wilds was a plane in the Astral Sea in the World Axis cosmology model. 
Every type of environment found on Toril was also found in the Deep Wilds, although their counterpart on this plane was much more extreme than that on the Material Plane.
The Deep Wilds were formed in the wake of the Spellplague, being a merging of Furys Heart and the House of Nature. 
The Deep Wilds were home to a variety of nature deities including Silvanus, Mielikki, Auril, Malar and Umberlee.  Silvanus ruled the plane as a whole and the other deities who dwelled in the Deep Wilds served him.
* Blood Sea, the domain of Umberlee that was wracked constantly by gale force winds.
* Land of the Hunt, the domain of Malar.
* Land Under Eternal Ice, the domain of Auril and reputedly the coldest place in any plane of existence.
* Summeroak, the domain of Silvanus. It laid deep within the heart of a vast woodland of mighty trees.
