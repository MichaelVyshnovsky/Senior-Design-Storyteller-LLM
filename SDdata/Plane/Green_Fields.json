        "mainbody": "Green Fields was the celestial home of the halfling pantheon. It was also the home of the souls of deceased good halflings.\nAs its name aptly implied, Green Fields consisted of a green field expanding ever outward in every direction.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, Green Fields was located in Venya, the third layer of the plane of Mount Celestia. In the World Tree cosmology it was its own celestial plane.\nIn 1372 DR, Gromph Baenre unintentionally visited the Green Fields during a spell battle with the Lichdrow Dyrr.\nDietr was a halfling from Luiren who dwelt in Green Fields after his death. When Gromph left the plane, he saw an opportunity to return to Faer√ªn to help his mother and followed the drow back to Menzoberranzan, where he was promptly turned into an undead huecuva. Gromph had no sympathy for Dietr and forced him to go up against the Lichdrow Dietr was easily destroyed."
