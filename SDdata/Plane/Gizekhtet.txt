Gizekhtet was one of two divine domains belonging to the Pharaonic and Mulhorandi goddess of love, Isis.
The three equally divided realms of Heliopolis, according to the Great Wheel.
In the Great Wheel cosmology, Gizekhtet was one of the three triangular divine realms that made up Heliopolis.
Under the World Tree cosmology, it was likewise part of Heliopolis, which in that cosmology was a neutral plane that was shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.
In the Great Wheel cosmology, it was said that there existed no restrictions upon the spells that one could cast while in Gizekhtet. However, if one were to use magic for evil purposes they would be stripped of their spellcasting ability by Isis, as she considered it a betrayal of her good will, and would only regain them upon leaving Heliopolis.
In both cosmologies Gizekhtet was a fertile desert realm. In the Great Wheel, it was said to have a sloping landscape and sported a moderate temperature. The majority of fauna in Heliopolis, as well as most flora were, found in Gizekhtet. Its sloping landscape was covered in thick grass and dotted with fig and palm trees.
* Gizekhtet (city), a city inhabited by the petitioners of this realm. In the World Tree cosmology, the area around this city was the most lush in all of Heliopolis.
* The River Isis, a waterway that ran through either the realm or its city, depending upon the cosmology. In the Great Wheel cosmology, it was said to solely run through the city, while in the World Tree cosmology it was said to run through both the city and much of Heliopolis, blessing both its fields and inhabitants.
