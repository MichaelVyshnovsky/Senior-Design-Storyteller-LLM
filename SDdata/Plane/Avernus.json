        "Geography": "Avernus was the largest layer of Baator and one of the most traditionally infernalâ€”a blasted hellscape in the most literal sense filled with rivers of lava, barren hills, and low, rocky mountains as far as the eye could see. dotted with bubbling [[tar pit]]s, sucking [[quicksand]], lakes of lava, and [[salt]] flats made from the tears of the damned.\n\n[[File:Zariel_in_Avernus-5e.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Zariel]] flying across the wastelands of Avernus.]]\n\nFireballs raced across the dark sky of Avernus, seemingly at random (but on closer inspection actively targeted motion), and fell to the scorched earth, leaving smoking impact craters and burnt corpses in their wake. Roiling clouds of red and black flickered with orange flames \n\nBlood, as it would happen, was the leitmotif of Avernus; it was where the [[River of Blood]] ran through Baator, collecting rivulets from every gulch, stream, and pool, from the victims of millions of battles.",
        "Cosmography": "As with all the [[lower planes]], the River Styx ran through Avernus, with a number of offshoots and falls.<ref> The Styx, which at one point flowed at the edge of the layer, was later located at its center thanks to a relentless baatezu campaigning and conquering of gate-towns along the layer's edges.",
        "Government": "[[File:Blood war-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A legion of [[barbazu]] (right) faces a horde of [[dretch]]es (left) in Avernus, the battlefield of the [[Blood War]].]]\nWhether for the living or the dead, Avernus was the entry point to Baator and the most commonly visited of the Nine Hells, since [[Asmodeus]] forbade any portals opening to other regions. Because of this, damned souls had to come through Avernus before reaching other layers of the Nine Hells and so the layer was frequently inhabited by the servants of other archdevils, such as the [[barbazu]]s that gathered the forsaken, or [[imp]] and [[spinagon]] messengers. The primary reason for the magical restriction was that, for a demonic invasion force to access the lower layers of Hell, they would be forced to conquer and claim the layer directly above it.\n\nAs the buffer between the Nine Hells and the [[Abyss]], Avernus was incredibly dangerous even without its natural hazards, as [[baatezu]] armies trained for future battles. It was in a state of constant expansion by military conquest.\n\nThe ruler of Avernus was titled the Lord of the First.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|18-21}} was demoted by Asmodeus and made her advisor. She resided in a soaring basalt citadel. When he ruled, Bel dwelled in his own fortress at the center of the [[Bronze Citadel]].",
        "Trade": "The famous material known as Baatorian green steel could only be found on the wasteland level of Avernus. This ore was extracted from deep shafts in large-scale mining operations. The ore could be used to forge green-tinted [[steel]], tougher, sharper, and lighter than steel found on the Prime.",
        "History": "[[File:Bloodwar.jpg|thumb|500x350px|The [[Blood War ]]in full swing on Avernus. Click on the image to get the full effect.]]\nAvernus was once ruled by then-archfiend [[Tiamat]], who served Asmodeus faithfully.\n\nAvernus was then ruled by [[Zariel]], until she was inevitably betrayed by Bel, a pit fiend general waging the Blood War and not one of the [[Dark Eight]]. He was Lord of the First by [[1372 DR]]. Bel's minions whispered that he kept Zariel prisoner deep within the Bronze Citadel and drained her of her hellish power, slowly turning her into a soul shell while he enhanced his might. Lacking the support of the other Lords of the Nine, bar maybe Asmodeus, Bel could advance no further, at least for the time being.\n\nDuring Bel's rule, Asmodeus asked Tiamat to offer covert aid to Zariel in order to prevent Bel from becoming too powerful, in a ploy orchestrated with Bel to keep Tiamat herself in check,\n\nSome time after the [[Spellplague]], Asmodeus offered Tiamat the rulership of Avernus once more. However, to avoid disappointing Asmodeus again and to prevent a conflict with Bel, Tiamat refused, instead offering to be Asmodeus' champion and devouring all who opposed him.\n\nSome time later, Bel fell out of favor with Asmodeus for his inability to successfully repel a demonic invasion of Avernus. Zariel reclaimed her title as Lord of Avernus following Bel's demotion. He was forced to serve as Zariel's advisor\n\nBefore Zariel's second rule, Avernus was known to be a rich and civilized realm of cities and commerce. The Blood War reduced the entire layer to a blasted and abandoned wasteland, whose only functioning structures were military citadels to muster the devilish forces.\nUpon her return to power, Zariel, still enraged from having been at Tiamat's mercy, assisted [[Severin Silrajin]] and a group of [[Red Wizards of Thay]] to free her from Avernus, if only to rid the layer of Tiamat's presence.",
