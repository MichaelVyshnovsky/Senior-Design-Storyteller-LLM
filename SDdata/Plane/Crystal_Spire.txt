The '''Crystal Spire''', formerly known as the '''Bone Castle''', It was located in the [[City of the Dead (Hades)|City of the Dead]] in the [[Oinos]] layer of [[Hades]] according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], and in the [[City of Judgment]] in the [[Fugue Plane]] according to the [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]] and [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] cosmologies.

==Description==
The spire was made of glimmering transparent rock.

==Cosmography==
In the World Tree and World Axis cosmologies, the tower stood at the center of the City of Judgment, around which stood the [[Wall of the Faithless]].

In the Great Wheel cosmology, the City of Judgment and the City of the Dead were distinct locations. The City of Judgment stood in the Fugue Plane and was the location where the dead waited to be claimed by their deities, while the City of the Dead in Oinos was the location of both the Crystal Spire and the Wall of the Faithless.

==History==
The realm was originally known as the Bone Castle and was the divine realm the [[Netherese pantheon|Netherese deity]] of the dead, Jergal, who ruled the domain from the Bone Throne. According to legend he was challenged by [[Dead Three|three powerful mortals]] and relinquished his divine portfolio to them. The Bone Castle was taken over by [[Myrkul]]. It was located in the middle of a realm of the dead known as the [[City of Strife]]. During the [[Time of Troubles]], the realm was taken over by [[Cyric]], who had assumed Myrkul's original portfolio and took over the entire city as his realm. When Cyric read from the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, he lost control of his realm and was driven away by Kelemvor, who took control of the realm and assumed much of Cyric's portfolio.

Kelemvor's first act upon seizing control of the realm was to change it into a gleaming tower of crystal, as a symbol of fairness and transparency. He renamed it the Crystal Tower, later also changing the surrounding city's name to City of the Dead.
