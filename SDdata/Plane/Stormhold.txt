Stormhold was the divine realm of Stronmaus, patron of the giant pantheon, and the ultimate destination of the afterlife for all storm giants of the Realms.
While Stormhold was said to lay within Gudheim in the Outlands, some scholars maintained it soared over the skies of Karasuthra, the third layer of the Beastlands.
Stormhold stood a grand, marble-and-gold palace, inlaid with gems and precious minerals whose color evoked the otherworldly silver of clouds. It stood atop an otherworldly stormhead that floated far above Karasuthra below. Lightning streaked across the skies over Stormhold, and the booming roar of thunder and divine laughter echoed across the realm.
The same scholars that situated Stormhold in the Beastlands, maintained the palace was illuminated by by the moon of Noctos.
Stormhold housed a magical, , opalescent pool that served as a gathering place for Stronmaus and his family. The waters of the pool had regenerative and restorative properties.
Cloud and storm giant petitioners dwelled amidst the palace and across the surrounding stormhead.
Regular guests of Stormhold included Hiatea, the Storm Lords sister, Surminare, the queen of selkies, Aerdrie Faenya, of the Seldarine, and Remnis, the god of eagles.
