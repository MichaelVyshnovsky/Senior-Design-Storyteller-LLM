        "mainbody": "The '''Domains of Delight''' were a grouping of [[demiplane]]s found in the [[Feywild]], each of which was ruled by an [[archfey]].",
        "Description": "Some domains were difficult to gain admittance within, often being obscured by an obfuscating barrier or protected by pass phrase, puzzle, or more simply the archfey's discretion.",
        "Cosmology": "Individual Domains of Delight were accessible from other planes by the same means used to travel to the Feywild, including [[fey crossroad|fey crossings]], and the ''[[plane shift]]'' spell.",
        "Geography": "The Domains of Delight each varied in size, from the size of a small field to an entire nation, The most powerful of the archfey, namely [[Titania]] and the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], held power that extended well beyond their own Domains of Delight, across nearly the entirety of the Feywild.\n\nWhen neighboring domains overlapped with one another, the residents of the contested area were beholden to the authority of each archfey. These instances often led to contention between their respective powers.",
        "Inhabitants": "Domains of Delight were often home to myriad [[awaken]]ed creatures, [[fey]] creatures, and other rarely-encountered beasts, including: [[boggle]]s, [[brigganock]]s, [[displacer beast]]s, [[harengon]], [[blink dog]]s, [[darkling]]s, [[faerie dragon]]s, various [[hag]]s, and [[jabberwock]]s.",
        "Notable Domains of Delight": "* [[Prismeer]], the domain of the archfey [[Zybilna]], an alias of the famous [[archmage]] Iggwilv.\n* Fablerise, the smaller domain of the archfey Yarnspinner, situated entirely within Prismeer."
