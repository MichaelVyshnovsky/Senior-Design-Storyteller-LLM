The '''Blood Rift''' was the rift that the [[River of Blood]] created when crossing the planes.

==Description==
The Rift served as the main connection between the [[Nine Hells]] and the [[Abyss]], so it was the main battlefield for the [[Blood War]]. In addition, it sometimes connected to other lower planes, bringing the eternal struggle there, until it floated away or a [[deity]] took action to stop the carnage.

The Blood Rift was very similar to the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]], with empty plains and rocky badlands, perfect for ambushes and treachery.

==History==
Some time during the [[Hundred Years of Chaos]], the Blood Rift was folded into the Abyss.
