The Courts of Illusion were the divine realm of Leira before her death during the Time of Troubles, according to the Great Wheel cosmology.
Like all of Leiras actions and deeds, her realm was covered in layers of illusion and deception.
Instead of simply destroying uninvited visitors to her realm, Leira merely imprisoned or otherwise restrained them.
