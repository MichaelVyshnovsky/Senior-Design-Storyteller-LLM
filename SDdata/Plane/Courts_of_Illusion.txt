The '''Courts of Illusion''' were the [[divine realm]] of [[Leira]] before her death during the [[Time of Troubles]], according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].

==Geography==
Like all of Leira's actions and deeds, her realm was covered in layers of [[illusion]] and deception.

==Inhabitants==
Instead of simply destroying uninvited visitors to her realm, Leira merely imprisoned or otherwise restrained them.
