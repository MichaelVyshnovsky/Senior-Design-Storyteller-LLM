The '''Feywild''', also known as the '''Plane of Faerie''' or simply '''Faerie''', as well as '''Isan Meidan''' by the [[uldra]], was an "echo" of the [[Prime Material Plane]] suffused with potent [[magic]]

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
[[File:Feywild.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Feywild often appeared as dark and mysterious to many observers...]]
The Feywild was a place of awe-inspiring natural beauty. The plane was always bathed in twilight of the setting (or perhaps rising) sun, with lanterns and fireflies providing additional, haunting lights. Visitors to the plane found that all sensations, both sensory and emotional, were heightened. Smells were stronger, colors were more vivid, and sounds were clearer, but at the same time shadows were darker and impulses were harder to control. Strong emotions even altered the landscape of the Feywild itself; despondent travelers would leave a trail of wilting flowers in their wake, and carefree animals traveled alongside chipper and cheerful individuals.

As an "echo" of the Prime Material plane, its geography was similar although not entirely identical to that of [[Toril]], While most Prime locations and landmarks had analogues in the Feywild, sites of civilization in the Prime could be so unimportant in the Feywild as to be easily missed, while natural landmarks might be significantly more majestic or extreme. Navigating the Feywild was further complicated by the fact that distances did not always make sense. While two landmarks might be the same distance apart as in the Prime when travelling in one direction, they might be inexplicably further or closer on the return trip. 

[[File:Feywild serene.png|thumb|right|300px|...but held some of the most beauteous locales in all the multiverse.]]
Further complicating any visit to the plane was that time did not flow the same in the Feywild as on the Prime. While any visitor would experience time flowing as normal, it was often the case that more time was passing in the Prime, sometimes on the order of weeks, months, or years longer than expected, although it was also possible for little or no time to have passed instead. At the same time, those with no fey ancestry might find their memories of time spent in the Feywild becoming hazy or vanishing altogether.

[[Arcane magic]] ran more freely and powerfully in the Feywild than it did in the Prime, and it was for this reason that so many of its inhabitants and landmarks were suffused with magic.

===Phenomena===
Motes of energy that originated in the Feywild manifested as ''[[feywild spark]]s''. These were highly sought after by adventurers that dared to brave the plane's perilous wilderness.

It was believed the barrier between the Feywild and Toril was especially weak on [[Ches 19]] of the [[Calendar of Harptos]]. This occasion was celebrated as the holiday [[Fey Day]] in the [[Faerûn]]ian city of [[Waterdeep]].

The most common means of traversing in or out of the Feywild was through a [[fey crossroad]], which often required special knowledge of how to pass between the planes. 

===Flora & Fauna===
The Feywild was home to unique varieties of plant life, including various fungi that held supernatural properties. Notable among these were [[eldercap]]s, [[Executioner's Hood]]s, and [[hummingbrella]]s.

==Cosmography==
The Feywild has had a unique relationship with the Prime Material plane, and consequently was in an unusual [[cosmology|cosmological]] position.
===Great Wheel Model===
Using the first iteration of the [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great Wheel]] cosmological model, the Faerie existed as one of the [[Outer Planes]], one that was coexistent with that of the Prime. This unique quality allowed creatures and fey beings to sometimes pass between the two planes at matching geographical locations without needing to traverse the [[Astral Plane]]. Indeed, the Plane of Faerie held no connections to most [[transitive planes]], including the Astral Plane, [[Ethereal Plane]], or the [[Plane of Shadow]].

[[File:4e FR cosmology.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] cosmological model asserted the Feywild was a parallel "echo" of the mortal Realms, akin to the contrasting [[Shadowfell]].]]
During this era, each location on the Prime held a duplicate in Faerie, albeit one altered in form and appearance by the plane's unique traits. Additionally, Faerie maintained some traits that were not observable during other times of history, such as lighter force of gravity than that felt on the Prime. 

Faerie's other planar traits, like the aforementioned [[Feywild#Passage of Time|extended perception of the passage of time]], were experienced by planar travelers following the reintroduction of the Great Wheel model that coincided with the [[Second Sundering]] of Toril and [[Abeir]]. New phenomena became apparent as well, such as incidents of memory loss expressed by these individuals. This second iteration of the Great Wheel model of the plane came to be known as the Feywild, following its [[Feywild#World Axis|World Axis]] predecessor, and retained the distinction of existing as a [[parallel plane]].

===World Tree Model===
The plane of Faerie was notably absent from the [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]] cosmological model that came into wide use for about just over a decade during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. This omission may have been linked to the continual weakening of the bond between Faerie and Toril,

===World Axis===
The late 14{{th}} century world-wide event known as the [[Spellplague]] led to a re-adjustment of the planes and the adoption of the [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] cosmological model. The Feywild as it was then called, was recreated as one of the parallel planes, that remained as such even following the Second Sundering.

Travel between the Feywild and the Prime became relatively easy for many inhabitants of each plane, as the boundary between them was quite thin, and in some cases there were regions which existed in an overlapping space between the two, Well-protected and often dangerous connections linked the Feywild with the [[astral dominion]]s of [[Arvandor]], the [[Deep Wilds]], and the [[Gates of the Moon]].

==Notable Locations==
Though much of the Feywild was the same as the Prime geographically, there were differences, and more importantly, the lands answered to different powers than those on Toril. Much of the [[elf|elven]] or [[fey eladrin|eladrin]] civilizations had their earliest roots here and abandoned remnants of their culture littered the landscape. Unlike the elves, however, who had all but abandoned the Feywild, some eladrin remained behind in the Feywild, most notably the "[[Noble eladrin|noble]]" eladrin, who maintained strong kingdoms and citadels. [[Evereska]], and [[New Sharandar]].

Some regions in the Feywild were known to attune to the most powerful creature nearby, fey or otherwise. These regions would warp to reflect the emotion or attitude of the creature to which they were attuned, with everything from the weather to the landscape changing to be more dismal, peaceful, or dangerous as best befitted the creature's mood. However, a creature could not exert direct or conscious control over their demesne.

===Realms===
[[File:Feywild map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A map of the Feywild, showing the relative locations of various cities and realms.]]
; [[Brokenstone Vale]] : The Feywild kingdom of [[lycanthrope]]s attracted outcasts and refugees from across the realms of mortals. It had a long and bloodied history, have been founded by a [[werewolf]] lord that fought for his people's freedom from the neighboring eladrin. Despite its past, Brokenstone's residents garnered benefits from choosing to remain in the Feywild that were unavailable to their kin that dwelled on the Prime.
; [[Iliyanbruen]] : The elven survivor-state of the ancient Faerûnian realm of [[Illefarn]] was reformed in the Feywild following its near-complete destruction on Toril. The Iliyanbruen elves were perceived as invaders by the native fey, and were forced to fight for their new home for many centuries.
; [[Nachtur]] : One of the most powerful [[goblin]] kingdoms in all the Feywild. It was labyrinth of underground warrens ruled over by the [[Gark|Great Gark]], Lord of All the Goblins. Gark commanded a host of mercenaries that served many malevolent beings such as [[hag]]s and Winter Fey lords.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|4}}
; [[Realm of Malabog]] : The domain of [[Malabog]], the fomorian king that extended his area of conquest beyond the Feydark into the wilderness up above.

Additionally, the demiplane of [[Sildëyuir]], the home of the [[star elf|star elves]], was at times said to be part of the Feywild, where it was said to occupy the location there that corresponded to the [[Yuirwood]] of the Material plane.

===Settlements===
[[File:Cendriane_Ruins.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[gnome]] adventurer plays hide-and-seek with a [[displacer beast]].]]
* [[Astrazalian]], the eladrin City of Starlight governed by Lady Shandria, niece of Titania. 
* [[Cendriane]], an ancient city that was taken over by the [[eladrin]] [[vampire lord|vampire]] named [[Kannoth|Lord Kannoth]].{{Cite dragon/391/Watchers at the Living Gate|67}}
* [[Evermeet]], the center of Elven culture on Faerûn was transported to the Feywild for over a Torillian century, following the Spellplague.
* [[Mithrendain]], the Autumn City of the Feywild was built atop a perilous passageway leading down to the Feydark below.
* [[Shinaelestra]], the Fading City of [[ranger]]s that wavered between the Feywild and the [https://tahlequahpointsoflight.fandom.com/wiki/Howling_Forest?action=edit&redlink=1 Howling Forest] on the world of [[Nerath]].

===Feydark===
The [[Feydark]] was the echo of Toril's [[Underdark]] in the Feywild. Like most parts of the Feywild, it was more majestic and fantastic than its natural counterpart, with cavernous maze-like tunnels filled with exotic [[fungi]]. 
[[File:Malabog'sCastle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Not all fomorians remained within the Underdark. King [[Malabog]] ruled his vast kingdom from his [[Malabog's Castle|mighty castle]].]]
; [[Mag Tureah]] : The most powerful of the Feydark's [[fomorian]] realms stood within a country-sized cavern lit by precious gems and stones. This kingdom was ruled by the fomorian king [[Bres]].
; [[Vor Thomil]] : This filthy subterranean realm was ruled by the malevolent fomorian Queen [[Connomae]]. Outsiders captured by the resident giants were mocked and humiliated for the queen's amusement, forced to masquerade as courtiers in a twisted mockery of royal assembly.

===Domains of Delight===
{{Main|Domains of Delight}}
Within the Feywild were numerous [[demiplanes]] created by the [[Archfey]], independent realms that were each formed to reflect the whims and emotions of its creator. They grew or shrunk in size depending on the power of their Archfey, occasionally leading to discontent among their leaders when borders of neighboring domains overlapped with one another.

One of the more prominent domains of delight was [[Prismeer]], the realm of [[Zybilna]]. The domain was shattered by the [[Hourglass Coven]] of [[hag]]s and reformed as three splinter-realms of [[Hither]], [[Thither]], and [[Yon]].

Also found within Prismeer was the lesser domain of [[Fablerise]]. This gloomy forest was created by [[Yarnspinner]], an enormous fey spider that attracted myriad ''[[awaken]]ed'' animals with his near endless supplies of stories and tales.

==History==
===Formation and Connection to Toril===
{{Quote|But tales are told of a time long past, when elves fled by the thousands from war-torn Faerie, that magical land that exists in the unseen shadows of a thousand worlds.|Excerpt from a letter from [[Kriios Halambar]], Master Luthier of [[New Olamn]].}}

The Feywild was created by the [[Primordial]]s, beings of power comparable with the [[deity|gods]]. Finding some things of the Prime too "bright" or too "dark," the primordials tore these parts from the Prime, creating the Feywild and the Plane of Shadow (later known as the Shadowfell), respectively. the plane came to be ruled by a mysterious [[fey creator race]], who gave rise to the first [[korred]]s, [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]], and [[pixie]]s. 

The first record of the fey immigrating to [[Abeir-Toril]] from Faerie—as the plane was previously called—came about ''circa'' [[-27000 DR]]. This great migration included [[lythari]], [[avariel]], and [[green elves]], ancestors of the [[wild elves]] and [[dark elves]],The ''[[Forgotten Realms Player's Guide]]'' uses the term "green elves" to refer to these eladrin. ancestors of the other elven races. The Fey ushered the elves to Toril, hoping the then-primitive creatures would help bring down the reign of [[dragon]]s. It was at this time that the ancient elves began their split into the [[Tel'Quessir]] of Toril and the [[fey eladrin|eladrin]] of the Feywild. 

Some centuries later, ''circa'' [[-25400 DR]], a small group of [[gold elves]] and [[silver elves]] also arrived on Toril following a magical experiment gone terribly awry that destroyed the island of [[Tintageer]] in Faerie.

During their millennium on Toril, the [[Noble eladrin|eladrin]] established numerous realms that were more-closely linked to Faerie that other locations across the world.

===Separation===
In the {{Yearlink|-2549}}, local [[drow]] introduced the [[Susurrus]] to the [[Shadowdale|Living Wood]] in the [[Eastern Heartlands]], severing the bond between the resident fey and the plane of Faerie.

Around the {{YearlinkName|-500}}, most of the fey of the [[Moonshae Isles]], including the [[LeShay]] and [[fomorian]] giants, left their home on Toril for Faerie. The isle of [[Karador]] sank beneath the waters of the [[Sea of Swords]].

After the fall of [[Iliyanbruen]] in the 2{{nd}} century [[DR]], some elves retreated for the isle of [[Evermeet]], yet others opted for another solution. A group of these elves actually transported Iliyanbruen's capital [[Sharandar]] back to the Plane of Faerie.

Over the millennia, the Plane of Faerie had slipped further and further away from the Prime, although they still remained inextricably linked.

===Reconnection===
[[File:NewSharandar - Howard Lyon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The fey settlement of [[New Sharander]] was the beneficiary of the renewed connection between the Feywild and the Prime. The city coexisted between both planes, linked by the ''[[Fey Crossing]]'' portal.]]
This relationship between the two planes was reversed entirely when the [[Spellplague]] struck in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, although the exact reasons for this remain unclear.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}{{Speculation}} or the significant number of realms that had been built by the eladrin over the course of centuries.

Regardless of the cause, the Feywild was yanked back into proximity with the Prime, and new [[fey crossroad|crossroads]] [[Evermeet]] slipped into the Feywild, as did the demiplane of [[Sildëyuir]]. 

Since the barrier between these two planes became much thinner, the eladrin discovered that they could slip easily between the Feywild and the Prime at sites of great elven magic and importance, such as Evermeet, Ironically, the recently-raised elven city of [[Myth Drannor]] was almost completely closed off from the Feywild.

Some time during or after the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the fomorian king [[Malabog]] forged an alliance with the [[Toril]]lian [[lich]] [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and prepared to invade the Realms by means of the transitive city of [[New Sharandar]]. The giant-king's war ended before it began, due to the intervention of [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurers]] from [[Neverwinter]].

With the end of the [[Second Sundering]], the Feywild remained closely tied to the Prime

==Inhabitants==
[[File:ElfInTheFeywild.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''An [[elf]] in the Feywild.'']]
The inhabitants of the Feywild varied in temperament from kind to malicious, but almost all had a mischievous side to them and few stopped to consider the needs or worries of visitors to their home. While many of those living in Faerie were untamed, large numbers also congregated according to race or by political allegiance. Just as the geography was reminiscent of [[Toril]]'s, some of its inhabitants existed as fey "echoes" of Prime creatures. 

All manner of [[fey]] species were found within the Feywild.

The [[leShay]] were an enigmatic species that were among the Feywild's most powerful inhabitants;<ref> though the various [[archfey]] were undoubtedly even more powerful.<ref>

[[Fey eladrin]] were the beings that had the closest thing to a civilization in the Feywild. They were the descendants of the elves that never left the Feywild, and over the millennia had become suffused with the plane's primal magic.

Other creatures that dwelled within the Feywild included [[moonstone dragon|moonstone]],<ref> [[mirage dragon|mirage]],<ref> and [[faerie dragon|faerie]] dragons; [[fomorian]]s and their servitor [[cyclops|cyclopes]] ruled much of the Feydark;<ref> and [[harengon]], who were blessed with good fortune.<ref> [[Goblinoid]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[giant]]s, and [[blight]]s could all be found in the more sinister regions of the plane.<ref>

===Seelie and Unseelie Fey===
Most but not all fey served one of two [[Deity|godlike]] [[archfey]] queens, [[Titania|Titania the Summer Queen]] or the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], who shared an ancient and bitter rivalry.{{Cite web/Fey Feature/Seelie and Unseelie Courts}} The Unseelie Court worked tirelessly to undermine the Seelie Court, sometimes violently but more often through games and cruel mischief.

The remaining inhabitants of the Feywild either held no allegiances except at their own whims, or served another of the archfey, such as [[Oberon]], [[Hyrsam]], or the [[Prince of Frost]]. Uglier inhabitants of the Feywild, such as fomorians and hags, were generally not welcome among either the Seelie or Unseelie Courts.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Dara Algwynenn Kalinoth]], a moon elf princess that became the prophet of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]].
* [[Sharlario Moonflower]], one of the first elves to emigrate from Faerie to Toril.
