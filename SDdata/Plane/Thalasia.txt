'''Thalasia''' was the fourth layer of [[Elysium]]. An endless ocean with numerous islands, it was the headwaters of the River [[Oceanus]].

==Description==
The layer's infinite ocean was peppered with islands with white [[sand]] beaches and warm lagoons. Some islands were populated and supported towns and communities of various sizes.

The weather on Thalasia varied from cold and windy to warm and calm. The seas could be rough when the weather was windy, but the islands generally enjoyed a mild tropical climate.

==Cosmography==
[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash, extended its branches to this layer, as well as all other layers of Elysium, except [[Belierin]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Portico]], an island town near where the Oceanus flowed into [[Belierin]] and a common stopping point for travelers.
* [[Ro Stau]], realm of [[Seker]], appeared as a sunlit pleasure hall at a river bank when it manifested here.<ref>
* [[Selkies' Grotto]], realm of [[Surminare]], goddess of [[selkie]]s. An underwater cave complex that was often visited by [[Deep Sashelas]] and [[Trishina]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Some islands in Thalasia were rumored to be inhabited by great heroes from the [[Prime Material plane]]. They could only be reached by travelers who sought the aid of those heroes, and only after certain conditions were met, determined by the heroes' individual legends.
