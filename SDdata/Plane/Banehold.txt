Banehold, sometimes called the Barrens of Doom and Despair, was a sinister plane of existence.
Banehold was one of a number of Outer Planes. It was an inhospitable locale, filled with vast deserts of black sand and huge plains of dark granite. There was no water to be found anywhere on the plane (except for the River of Blood), and no sunlight filled the blood-red sky.
Deities who made their home on this plane included Bane, Beshaba, Hoar, Loviatar, and Talona. Kuraulyek dwelled in this planes Underdark.
The Barrens of Doom and Despair consisted of a single infinite plane in Gehenna. There were no constituent layers. It linked via the Astral Plane to the planes of the Prime Material (such as Toril) and a number of portals directly connected it with Hammergrim and the Blood Rift. Beshabas realm, the Blood Tor, linked directly to the Abyss.
