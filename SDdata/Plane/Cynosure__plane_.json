        "mainbody": "'''Cynosure''', also known as the '''Hall of Meeting''', was a small plane located very close―cosmologically speaking―to [[Toril]]. It was a plane only accessible to deities, and they could only access it from within their own domains. The plane was considered neutral ground by all the powers of [[Faerûn]], and was used as a meeting ground to settle disputes\n\nThe only way in and out of Cynosure was through the [[portal]]s leading to each deity's realm, and it could not be accessed by spells that normally allowed planar travel, so the plane could not be used as a way station as Toril could. There could at times be several deities meeting in Cynosure, and yet other times the demiplane lay empty for extended periods of time.",
