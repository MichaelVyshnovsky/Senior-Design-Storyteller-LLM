Long ago, the layer was flooded to prevent the [[baatezu]] from ever invading it again. Umberlee, the evil goddess of the sea, makes her realm in those waters.

            "Flora & Fauna": "Very little vegetation could be found on the Blood Tor. The most common plant life was the red and black [[lichen]] that grew on the black and grey rocks of Beshaba's mountain.\n\nThe 13{{th}} layer of the Abyss was home to huge black [[stag]]s, totem servants of Beshaba. These creatures haunted the visitors of the Maid of Misfortune's realm. and deadly [[fetch]]."

        "History": "The Blood Tor was considered one of the greatest [[tanar'ri]] military successes of the [[Blood War]]. The layer was the site of a major but unsuccessful baatezu blitz.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Beshaba used one of her blood-water ''scrying'' pools to punish [[Doljust]], an aging nobleman who had displeased the goddess of ill-luck. She watched Doljust as he faced off against a [[werebat]]. The creature's cave had two dead toddlers in front of it, which was a grim omen of things to come. The goddess swayed the noble's [[dog|hound]], forcing the beast to pounce at the [[lycanthrope]] as Doljust swung his [[sword]]. As the man mourned his beloved dying dog, Beshaba's vengeance became apparent. Doljust swung his blade once again at a sound that came from behind. A moment later, another, smaller werebat, cleaved by Doljust's sword, shifted back to its humanoid form. The adolescent werebeast was a young child who whispered \"grandfather\" as he died in his older relative's arms. Satisfied with her work, Beshaba dismissed the ''scrying'' spell and left the cave with the blood-red pool.\n\nLater the same year, a group of adventurers, sent by Beshaba's fellow Torillian deity [[Finder Wyvernspur]], arrived at the Blood Tor. [[Joel]] the Rebel Bard, a winged fighter named [[Jasmine]], and a cheerful [[kender]] called [[Emilo Haversack]] traveled the deadly slopes of the Tor towards Beshaba's tower, thinking that the Lady of Misfortune was behind recent power surges that plagued Beshaba's sister [[Tymora]]. During their travels, [[Iyachtu Xvim]] attempted to lead the group to certain death in the guise of a god from the world of [[Krynn]], [[Sirrion]]. The adventurers faced a deadly fetch, survived, and eventually discovered the Beshaba suffered the same affliction as her sister, sending waves and quakes of her divine power across the Blood Tor and wreaking havoc on Toril.\n\nFollowing the events of the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the Blood Tor became part of [[Tempus]]'s divine realm of the [[Warrior's Rest]] in [[Limbo]].",
