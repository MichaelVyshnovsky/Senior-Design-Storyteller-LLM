        "mainbody": "The '''Murky Depths''', according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], was the [[divine realm]] of [[Blibdoolpoolp]], the patron [[god]]dess of the [[kuo-toa]].",
        "Description": "Located in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], the realm resembled a pocket of smoke, its gloomy waters constantly churned and swirled based on her emotional state of Blibdoolpoolp. It stretched for several hundred miles and had sea floor filled with sand. Unlike the rest of the Elemental Plane of Water, the Murky Depths possessed a gravitational pull.",
        "Inhabitants": "The realm was kept surrounded by giant primitive crustaceans in an attempt by the Sea Mother to convince herself that her powers had not diminished. Visitors to her realm who could not breathe underwater were granted that ability by the deity herself, a boon which also put them immediately in her debt.\n\nPetitioners of Blibdoolpoolp built a city of twisted coral and stone on the sea bed. It was said that this city was a mirror for the twisted mind of the goddess herself."
