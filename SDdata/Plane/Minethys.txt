}}'''Minethys''', also called the '''Blasted''', was the third layer of [[Carceri]].

==Description==
Minethys looked like a string of planet-sized beads, or orbs, but without a string. The distance between two orbs was about {{SI|5000|mi|k|long=yes}}. The orbs were smaller than the ones in [[Cathrys]].

==Features==
The orbs of Minethys were desert worlds. The place was cold and windy. The constant wind blew up the yellow desert [[sand]]. This caused, apart from bad vision, unprotected people to choke on the dust or to get actually hurt by the blown sand. The latter was lethally dangerous and heavy clothing was required for protection,

The flying yellow sand combined with the red glow of the orbs caused the orbs to look orange. These clouds stank like a ''[[stinking cloud]]''. Wet cloth was enough protection against it.

About every ten days, the deserts were beset by a tornado. They were dangerous but could be used to fly from one orb to the next&mdash;most people did not survive it.

==Locations==
[[Fiend]]s and [[petitioner]]s were not immune to the skin-flaying sand. Thus they wore clothing and dug up holes with their hands to evade the tornadoes.

===Notable Locations===
;[[Mausoleum of Pain]]: The Mausoleum of Pain was the seat of power of [[Falazure]], an aspect of [[Null]] the Death Wyrm.<ref>
;[[Rack of Injustice|The Rack of Injustice]]: [[Karontor]], god of [[fomorian]]s and [[verbeeg]], made in his realm, the Rack of Injustice, here.<ref>
;[[Trickster's Delight]]: Trickster's Delight was the seat of power of [[Parrafaire]].
;[[Sand Tombs of Payratheon]]: The remnants of an old city were covered by sand but appeared for an hour or so from time to time.

==Inhabitants==
[[Petitioner]]s of Minethys were the souls of greedy people. They remained greedy in death and, because they did not do or share anything without being paid, bartered for services and cloths for protection. Some managed to gain so much service they could build sand huts against the wind that could not withstand the frequent tornadoes.
