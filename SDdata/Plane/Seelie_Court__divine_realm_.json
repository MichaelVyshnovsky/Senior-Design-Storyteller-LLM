        "mainbody": "he Seelie Court was the divine realm that was home to the pantheon of the same name.\nWherever it was, the Court manifested as a calm woodland full of glades, either cloaked in eternal twilight or warmed by gentle sunlight.\nThe Seelie Court mimicked the appearance of nature. Trees formed columns and living ceilings, phosphorescent flowers bloomed where lanterns might be, and semi-precious jewels floated down waterways.\nThe Seelie Court wandered through the planes of Arborea, Ysgard, and the Beastlands according to Titanias whim. Time was known to flow differently within its borders.\nVerenestra was known to have her own bower in the Seelie Court, consisting of a grove of silver birch, larch, and willow trees all decorated with silver filigree.\nMost of the inhabitants, however, lived in open-air conditions. There were no settlements.\nThe Seelie Courts most notable inhabitants were the deities who lived there, particularly Queen Titania, the ruler of the pantheon, and King Oberon.\nHowever, a number of other fey also dwelt in the realm. Beautiful but elitist, these courtiers thrived on politicking and gossip, with the court fey forming endless cliques and factions. They only admitted pure-blooded fey to their ranks, and, when dealing with outsiders, preferred those with fey, elven, or celestial blood."
