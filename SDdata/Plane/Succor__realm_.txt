'''Succor''' was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic]] and [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity|goddess]] of motherhood and the hearth, [[Hathor]].

==Cosmography==
Under the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], this divine realm was located within [[Elysium]] in the layer of [[Amoria]]. It was situated adjacent to the realm of [[Quietude]], a divine realm belonging to Hathor's ally and fellow pantheon member [[Isis]]. But in the [[World Tree cosmology]], it was said to be part of [[Heliopolis]] and once again close to the realm of Isis, a [[plane]] shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.

==Geography==
In the Great Wheel's conception of Succor, the realm had a similar terrain to that of Quietude, In Heliopolis, the plane was said to be a fertile valley.

==Notable Locations==
A single, peaceful village stood within the plane.

==Inhabitants==
The plane was inhabited largely by [[petitioner]]s that were in life mothers or children, though it regularly had an influx of people seeking refuge.
