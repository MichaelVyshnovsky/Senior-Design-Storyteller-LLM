Succor was the divine realm of the Pharaonic and Mulhorandi goddess of motherhood and the hearth, Hathor.
Under the Great Wheel cosmology, this divine realm was located within Elysium in the layer of Amoria. It was situated adjacent to the realm of Quietude, a divine realm belonging to Hathors ally and fellow pantheon member Isis. But in the World Tree cosmology, it was said to be part of Heliopolis and once again close to the realm of Isis, a plane shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.
In the Great Wheels conception of Succor, the realm had a similar terrain to that of Quietude, In Heliopolis, the plane was said to be a fertile valley.
A single, peaceful village stood within the plane.
The plane was inhabited largely by petitioners that were in life mothers or children, though it regularly had an influx of people seeking refuge.
