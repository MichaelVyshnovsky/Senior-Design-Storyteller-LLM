        "mainbody": "The '''Concordant Domain of the Outlands''', also known as '''Concordant Opposition''', was the center of the [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great Wheel]] of [[Outer Planes]]. It connected to all other Outer Planes and was truly [[neutral]] in alignment. '''Godsland''', and '''Friendly Opposition'''. and the [[Fugue Plane]] when that cosmology became popular. Both of these planes survived the [[Spellplague]] to float in the [[Astral Sea]].\n\nThe Outlands was the exception to many of the rules governing the Outer Planes, the first being its lack of alignment or true neutrality. It was an infinite plane, yet it had a definite center (the [[Spire]] with [[Sigil]] on top). The properties of all the other Outer Planes were mixed together in the Outlands. Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos existed here in all their forms, but they were less able to affect each other due to the neutralizing effect of this plane.",
        "Description": "While there was no sun in the Outlands, the plane still had day and night cycles.",
        "Geography": "This plane defied description by changing the perception of those who entered, becoming a completely new and yet familiar plane with each visit. Typically on the first visit the plane appeared as a larger version of the visitor's homeland. (A farmer would see vast farmland, a scribe would see a huge library for example.) Subsequent visits would reveal a different face but demesnes remained in the same spatial location&mdash;a city on one visit might be a forest with inhabitable trees on the next&mdash;chaotic variation but with the same order and placement. Deities could not fully control what visitors saw and heard in their realms, but they could influence the appearance to represent their proclivities.\n\nThe Outlands had a neutralizing effect on the randomness of weapons and spells, reducing all healing and damage to the minimum possible while having no effect on strength or magical bonuses. In addition to this, magic itself was gradually neutralized as you approached the center of the plane (which appeared as a huge mountain, tree, fountain, tornado, tower, column, etc.). At about {{SI|1000|mi|k|long=yes}} out, high-level spells ceased to function. Every {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} or so, lower level spells would begin to fail, until finally at {{SI|200|mi|k|long=yes}} from the center even first-level spells would not function. This applied to [[divine magic]] and the powers of the gods as well. Therefore, this ring around the center of the plane became a meeting place, bazaar, and common ground used by every intelligent species of the Outer Planes including [[greater deity|greater deities]] of differing alignments. Moving in closer to the center, at about {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}}, all chemical reactions ceased to function and even the gods could not get any closer to the center of the plane.\n\nThe [[Astral Plane]] connected to the plane of the Outlands by [[color pool]]s, which were never closer than {{SI|600|mi|k|long=yes}} from each other.\n\nThe Outlands connected to all the other [[Outer Planes]] via portals. According to one early scholar, these sixteen ''[[portal]]s'' were always seen as white disks of various sizes laid into the ground and were found at the {{SIAdj|1000|mi|k}} mark in a ring around the center of the plane. Each disk could send travelers to any plane they concentrated on. If a group used the ''portal'', the destination was determined by the majority. Beings of a chaotic nature would sometimes be taken to the wrong destination.",
