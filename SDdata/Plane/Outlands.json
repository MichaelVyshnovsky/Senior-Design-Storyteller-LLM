        "mainbody": "The Concordant Domain of the Outlands, also known as Concordant Opposition, was the center of the Great Wheel of Outer Planes. It connected to all other Outer Planes and was truly neutral in alignment. Godsland, and Friendly Opposition. and the Fugue Plane when that cosmology became popular. Both of these planes survived the Spellplague to float in the Astral Sea.\nThe Outlands was the exception to many of the rules governing the Outer Planes, the first being its lack of alignment or true neutrality. It was an infinite plane, yet it had a definite center (the Spire with Sigil on top). The properties of all the other Outer Planes were mixed together in the Outlands. Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos existed here in all their forms, but they were less able to affect each other due to the neutralizing effect of this plane.\nWhile there was no sun in the Outlands, the plane still had day and night cycles.\nThis plane defied description by changing the perception of those who entered, becoming a completely new and yet familiar plane with each visit. Typically on the first visit the plane appeared as a larger version of the visitors homeland. (A farmer would see vast farmland, a scribe would see a huge library for example.) Subsequent visits would reveal a different face but demesnes remained in the same spatial location&mdasha city on one visit might be a forest with inhabitable trees on the next&mdashchaotic variation but with the same order and placement. Deities could not fully control what visitors saw and heard in their realms, but they could influence the appearance to represent their proclivities.\nThe Outlands had a neutralizing effect on the randomness of weapons and spells, reducing all healing and damage to the minimum possible while having no effect on strength or magical bonuses. In addition to this, magic itself was gradually neutralized as you approached the center of the plane (which appeared as a huge mountain, tree, fountain, tornado, tower, column, etc.). At about  out, high-level spells ceased to function. Every  or so, lower level spells would begin to fail, until finally at  from the center even first-level spells would not function. This applied to divine magic and the powers of the gods as well. Therefore, this ring around the center of the plane became a meeting place, bazaar, and common ground used by every intelligent species of the Outer Planes including greater deities of differing alignments. Moving in closer to the center, at about , all chemical reactions ceased to function and even the gods could not get any closer to the center of the plane.\nThe Astral Plane connected to the plane of the Outlands by color pools, which were never closer than  from each other.\nThe Outlands connected to all the other Outer Planes via portals. According to one early scholar, these sixteen portals were always seen as white disks of various sizes laid into the ground and were found at the  mark in a ring around the center of the plane. Each disk could send travelers to any plane they concentrated on. If a group used the portal, the destination was determined by the majority. Beings of a chaotic nature would sometimes be taken to the wrong destination.\nthumb|right|300px|A rough map of the Outlands, showing the relative locations of the 16 gate-towns and the city of Sigil above the spire.\nAround the outer edge of the Outlands were sixteen evenly spaced settlements that were each constructed around a portal to one particular Outer Plane. For that reason, each gate-town shared many characteristics of the plane to which it connected.\nThe sixteen gate-towns were\nExcelsior\n A beautiful, well-defended city with a kind population, it connected to Mount Celestia.\nTradegate\n A star-shaped city that bristled with commerce and constant activity, it connected to Bytopia via a complex trade system with a bariaur known as the Master Trader.\nEcstasy\n A peaceful, pastoral town, it connected to Elysium.\nFaunel\n A ruined city, but bristling with life, it connected to the Beastlands.\nSylvania\n A constantly partying town where music played day and night, it connected to Arborea.\nGlorium\n A fishing village built at the edge of a fjord, it connected to Ysgard via two different portals.

All manner of demons, devils, spirit legions, einheriar, planetars, devas, rilmani and slaadi could be found here, for example."
