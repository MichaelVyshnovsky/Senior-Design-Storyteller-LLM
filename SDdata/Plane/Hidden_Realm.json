        "mainbody": "The Hidden Realm was the divine realm of Annam All-Father, the chief deity of the giant pantheon. In the Great Wheel cosmology, it was located somewhere in the Outlands.\nThe exact location of the Hidden Realm within the Outlands was unknown. No maps existed with any information on the realms whereabouts. It was speculated that the realm was magically cloaked from detection or located in a demiplane connected to the Outlands via a portal.\nThe realm itself contained a large crystal tower\nAnnam left his original realm of Gudheim within Jotunheim as a consequence of his pact with Othea to abandon the giants until the glory of Ostoria was restored. He established himself in the Outlands for the duration of his exile.\nIt was speculated by some sages that the Hidden Realm, in fact, did not exist. Others argued that the realm itself was the master control of the planes."
