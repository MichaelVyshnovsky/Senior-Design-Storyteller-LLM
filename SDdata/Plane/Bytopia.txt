The '''Twin Paradises of Bytopia''' were two layers that formed one of the [[Outer Planes]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model representing alignments between [[lawful good]] and [[neutral good]].

Some characteristics of this plane were ascribed to the [[World Tree cosmology]] planes of [[Golden Hills]] and the [[House of the Triad]] when that cosmology became popular. The Golden Hills became part of [[Arvandor]] after the [[Spellplague]] and the House of the Triad became known as [[Celestia]] as described by the [[World Axis cosmology]].

==Description==
The two layers of this plane were joined at one barrier which happened to span the entire sky at about 10 miles (16km) above sea level. Gravity for each layer was normal for that layer but switched direction as soon as one crossed the barrier. The inhabitants of one layer could look up and see the other layer hanging upside down high overhead. Several mountains reached the crossover point and a few met mountains rising up from the other side, allowing careful climbers a way to reach the other layer. Also the space between layers was filled with air, allowing flight from one side to the other. Each layer glowed with a golden-white light.

===Dothion===
{{Main|Dothion}}
Dothion was a bucolic land of old forests and huge meadows subject to mild seasonal changes and gentle weather. Portals to [[Seven Heavens]], [[Elysium]], and [[Concordant Opposition]] were found in caverns as brightly glowing patterns: concentric circles for the Seven Heavens, radiating lines for Elysium, and both patterns superimposed, which resembled a spider web, for Concordant Opposition. Travelers from the [[Astral Plane]] would emerge from the ''color pools'' on this layer.

===Shurrock===
{{Main|Shurrock}}
Across the barrier, Shurrock had much the same landscape features but much harsher weather: summers were hot and winters were long and cold. Storms were more common here, with booming thunder and heavy rains. Life on the Shurrock side was more challenging and kept the inhabitants busy, but both sides were virtuously industrious.

==Inhabitants==
The animals in the Twin Paradises were sentient with average intelligence or above, but did not have the ability to speak. Some trees were also intelligent, similar to [[treant]]s from the [[Prime Material Plane]]. [[planetar]]s, [[hollyphant]]s, [[deva]]s, [[foo creature]]s, [[baku]], and [[agathia]].

Inhabitants of the plane created a type of [[Bytopian Stout!|stout]] and a type of aromatic [[spice]]d [[nutbread]] with [[carrot]]s and [[almond]]s. It was served in thick slices and tasted mildly sweet. These products could be found sold in the planar city of [[Sigil]].
