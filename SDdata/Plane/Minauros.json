        "mainbody": "nauros was best described as a great stinking swamp, a fetid marsh of mire, muck and misery extending further than one could possibly imagine. The layer was arguably the most diseased of all the [[lower planes]],{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|24-26}} where the corrupting powers of poison and illness were enhanced and recovery diminished.\n\nMuch of Minauros was dominated by a dreary urban landscape,{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|26}}\n\n===Geography===\nThe black, putrid surface of Minauros was covered in thick layers of scum and dotted with a series of mud flats and cesspools. The bubbling, filthy waters dispersed various foul odors and yellow-green swamp gas faintly illuminated the murky, fog-shrouded air. In some places infernal heat rose up from below, boiling and steaming the dank waters and creating mud geysers, while others were so cold the water iced over.\n\nBeneath the slowing mud were deep pits, which combined with the other hidden dangers required travelers to cautiously slog their way through the unpleasant swamp. Deeper in the plane, the marshes eventually gave way to stretches of lifeless, cinder-choked trees and volcanic ridges, the [[obsidian]] and igneous rock meandering eternally through the swamp, undulating across the land like serpents frozen into the ground. Eventually, upon nearing the center of the plane, these ridges rose into a vast and tortured volcanic badland of ash-hills and slime-filled rifts.\n\n===Weather===\nThe dimmed, eternally overcast skies of Minauros ranged from brown to leaden and roiled with fecund, drooping clouds ranging from slate gray to putrescent indigo. More often than not the surface was buffeted by harsh and cold winds.\n\nThe weather of Baator was not really weather as such, but rather vigorously regulated features of a [[lawful]] plane, all happening for a reason, and the steady, never-ending rains of Minauros were no exception. An incessant pour of acid rain pelted the soil from above, an oily, rusty, pungent and polluted barrage that created a sound like hundreds of beaten drums. Usually this was followed by sleet, which struck travelers and stuck to them to create an icy coating that slowly melted into an oily residue irremovable while still on the plane. Lastly came the frequent and sudden rushes of jagged, flesh-flaying hail, composed of balls of polluted ice sometimes augmented with hooks, metal shards, and the still-sharp teeth of long-dead devils.\n\nThese changes in atmosphere were cyclical in nature, the other effects accompanying the rain. Hailstorms reoccurred at least every five minutes and would take under half an hour maximum to return. The storms lasted anywhere between a few seconds and a couple minutes, made worse by the fact that the bitter winds of a raging storm made flying, the otherwise fastest method of travel, highly dangerous. Away from any kind of structure, the only shelter for those unfortunates caught outside was the ridges, hiding behind which was effectively the same as having none.",

        "Cosmography": {
            "World Axis": "In the [[World Axis cosmology]] model, the Nine Hells were a planet-shaped [[astral dominion]] floating in the [[Astral Sea]], no longer of infinite size nor consisting of layers. In this cosmology Minauros was a dark and brooding cavern about {{SI|300|mi|k|long=yes}} across and a few {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} high supported by columns of rock every {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} or so, the rain caused by the oily water seeping from the ceiling. It was reached by descending down a road lined with gibbets from the lower gate of Dis which gradually broadened out into the layer of Minauros. Traveling scores of miles down dripping steps cut into Minauros's muddy geysers would put one at the feet of great rocky columns before a steep descent to the blackened plains of Phlegethos.\n\nIn the World Axis, the Styx plummeted into Minauros from a fuming cavern in Avernus, slowly and sluggishly wandering on a long, dark journey before emerging in the icy seas of [[Stygia]]."

        "Notable Locations": {
            "Divine Realms": "* [[Aeaea]], the secondary realm of [[Hecate]], the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian]] interloper deity of magic and the moon. It was a chilly, desolate land shrouded in fog where even those with an infallible sense of direction would become lost. The realm was littered with thousands of strange, sculptural devices that converted souls into [[sorcerer]]ous and [[Divine magic|divine]] energy, and which her [[cleric]]s claimed generated all magic in the [[multiverse]].''[[Tales of the Outer Planes]]'' identifies Hecate's divine realm as residing on [[Phlegethos]], the fourth layer of the Nine Hells, but the later books ''[[Guide to Hell]]'' and ''[[Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells]]'' change its location as being in the third layer, [[Minauros]].\n\n* The [[divine realm]] of [[Pisaethces]] the Blood Queen. The bog around her unmoving form received a constant stream of her \"blood\", which in truth was a vast miasma of blood-red mucus."
        },
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Devils": "Devils residing in Minauros were pained, if not hurt by the plane's hail. The native high-rankers had enough practice to walk and fly normally through its storms.\n\nThe devils in service to Mammon were known to emulate his behavior in the hopes of impressing him. As a result they were indirect to the point where even orders were given like riddles, with their plans convoluted to match. Unlike other devils, who saw treasures as a means to an end, his minions were so consumed by greed that they would take moderate risks to protect their hard-won gold,<ref> and they specialized in soul-based transactions (though even they marveled at the low prices for which many mortals sold their souls).<ref>\n\nThe devils of Minauros benefitted from the highest promotion rate out of all the circles of the Nine Hells whilst simultaneously suffering under an excessively high rate of demotion. Mammon was incredibly vindictive, constantly alert for the faintest hint of insult and known to cast down his servitors for the slightest provocation, such that the layer was full of devils hoping to regain his approval. To compensate for this constant onslaught of favor and banishment, a ready supply of least devils was kept as a talent pool. [[Lemure]]s and [[spinagon]]s were unusually common, and woeful, demoted [[nupperibo]]s so ubiquitous it was hard not to trip over them in the swamp.\n\nOther common devil types in Minauros included [[barbazu]]s, [[hamatula]]s, [[excruciarch]]s, and kytons though [[imp]]s, [[merregon]]s, and [[cambion]]s could also be fairly reliably found. [[Narzugon]]s meanwhile were actively sought out for Mammon's entourage to satisfy his need for absolute loyalty, and so his bearded devils often traded for souls suitable for such a transformation.\n\n[[Abishai]] and [[osyluth]]s were somewhat uncommon, but still present in Minauros. [[Erinyes]] were infrequent, but even rarer were [[cornugon]]s, [[amnizu]] and pit fiends,",
            "Petitioners and Planars": "The baatezu of Minauros scoured the layer for beings to enslave and put to work. Normal petitioners, as well as captured intruders, were kept in shallow pits about {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} deep. These \"cells\" were the only places stone was used out in the marshes. Great chains and manacles of iron or brass were fastened to the prisoners on one end and on the other to stone pillars sinking slightly slower than the Sinking City. Prisoners stood or sat in the cold fetor until death or if taken away for some other wicked intention, such as slave labor or a Blood War draft. Those who survived eventually learned to keep close to the rock for protection and support, find elevated bones to stand on and keep their heads above water even when sleeping.\n\nThe need for guards to keep order in Minauros was the reason why hamatulas were so common there. Typically they were perched atop the stones and willing to burn or scald captives with precise uses of ''[[produce flame]]''. They brought all they captured to the prisons and were active in their duty to track and hunt down those who attempted to escape. If Mammon's lieutenants were occupied however, they sometimes let their prisoners escape on purpose just to hunt them for sport. For anything they could not deal with themselves they called upon one of the lieutenants (such as Focalor) or even Mammon himself to deal with.\n\nDespite hamatula vigilance\n\nThe souls of the damned, even those fated for other realms of torment, generally made their way to Minauros first. First they arrived in Jangling Hiter to undergo processing, which entailed a regimen of torture to prepare them to become lemures. Other archdukes outsourced much of this work to the City of Chains and its factory-like flaying facilities. Souls were carted in by the tumbrel and then shipped off the same way to the Sinking City when stripped of personhood and ready for transforming.\n\nDespite the plethora of dangers and difficulties inherent to doing so, there were still some evil mortals and wayward fiends who willingly came to Minauros, usually crazier and viler than even their chosen masters. Precarious citizenship could be gained by proving one's usefulness to Mammon, with most of such interlopers being soul trade functionaries.",
            "Others": "Even the devils feared the things that lurked in Minauros, both from straying too far from their cities{{Cite dragon/343/Creature Collection V|45-48}} Fiery hellstinger [[scorpion]]s were common there, but there were also rumors of a hive of [[mosquito]]-like insects, the seekers of which never returned, and record of monstrous [[spider]]s called [[hellchain weaver]]s which terrified even the kytons ostensibly living in the depths of Jangling Hiter. Beneath the murky waters roamed terrible, nameless creatures and giant monsters of shadow, but none were willing to swim deep enough to discover what truly lied beneath the surface.\n\nLegendary among the devil-feared monsters of the plane was the immense Worm of Minauros, a bizarre, [[purple worm]] like creature with [[ivory]]-plates and a crested head resembling the gnarled skull of an archdevil. This creature eternally haunted the hinterlands of Minauros, always returning when killed, existing only to punish stray or unwary devils and attacking mortals only in self-defense. Non-[[lawful evil]] mortals who openly offered themselves to it and survived being swallowed and excreted would be enhanced for a month, but renewal of such power required them to draw closer and closer to lawful evil. It killed the lawful evil, identified by smell, in an attempt to damn them."
        },
        "History": "The sinking effect of Minauros had been in effect for as far back as mortal memory and knowledge extended. Mammon had despoiled vast stretches of his own layer to build his Sinking City.\n\n[[Glasya]]'s rise to archduchess sometime during [[1353 DR]] frightened Mammon into action beyond Baator. Based on the principle that money was the root of all evil, Mammon whipped the devils of Minauros into a frenzied campaign of economic warfare  upon unsuspecting centers of good on the [[Material Plane]]. By collapsing the economies of prosperous nations, he hoped to instigate such despair and desperation that millions of souls would be driven to corruption and damnation in the process.\n\nThe resultant frenzy during this period saw Mammon's cities creepily depopulated. All his devils were hard at work sabotaging industries, ruining works of charity and otherwise destabilizing major nations of the Material Plane. Each sought ripe targets for the scheme and might be temporarily bought off with worthwhile intelligence.",
        "Trivia": "* The plane of Minauros was named after the Sinking City of Minauros,"
