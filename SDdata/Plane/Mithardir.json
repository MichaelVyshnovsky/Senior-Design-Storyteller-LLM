        "mainbody": "'''Mithardir''', also known as '''Pelion''', was the third and deepest layer of [[Arborea]]. An endless desert of fine, [[chalk]]-like white dust, it was mostly uninhabited, containing only ruins and the buried remains of previous civilizations. Its only inhabited area was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity]] [[Nephthys]].",
        "Geography": "The layer had almost no vegetation. It was entirely covered in a white, powdery dust that gave it its nameâ€•\"Mithardir\" meant \"white dust\" in the [[Elven language]]. Some areas were also covered in snow. Its climate was mild and temperate, but often swept by intense and sudden dust and lightning storms. The entire layer evoked a sense of emptiness, loss, and abandonment.",
        "History": "The layer was once covered in forest and inhabited by [[giant]]-like or [[titan]]-like deities.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The distant past of the layer was surrounded in legend and conflicting tales. The [[Seldarine]] maintained that Mithardir once held the realms of the lords of [[beast cult]]s, before they moved on to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]]. Others maintained that Pelion was the original layer that housed the divine realms of [[Ptah]] and the rest of the pantheon, before dwindling away due to lack of followers.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Amun-thys]], realm of [[Nephthys]]. An ever-shifting realm of dunes, dotted with abandoned tombs and inhabited by desert fauna and tribes of [[lycanthrope]]s, with very little vegetation that was brittle, desiccated, and colored white as its sands. The most prominent species were [[white lotus]], [[dust reed]], and [[tumbling lily]]. It was unclear whether the desertification of the layer was a process caused by Nephthys's influence or in spite of it.\n* [[Coriandor]], an elven village that encompassed both sides of a gate between this layer and the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Salt]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The primary inhabitants of Mithardir were the [[bralani]] [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]]. Other than that, the layer was populated only by small [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, and desert [[rat]]s, as well as occasional [[vulture]]s, [[adder]]s, and [[scorpion]]s. Pelion had very few inhabitants. Most notable were the [[brass dragon]] [[Argevar]] and a [[phoenix]] who nested somewhere among the dunes. The layer was also said to be inhabited by a tribe of [[elves]] from the world of [[Athas]]."
