The Infinite Layers of the Abyss (|audio=Abyss.ogg) was the birth place of the demons, The Abysss place in the cosmology of the Forgotten Realms shifted over time, but the nature of the plane remained fairly constant a violent, malevolent place where the strong survived on the backs of the weak, the weak conspired to overthrow the strong, alliances only lasted while convenient, and the landscape itself tortured the mind and body of all who dared to pass.
In the Great Wheel cosmology model, the Abyss was an Outer plane on the Great Wheel connected to the Astral plane, Pandemonium, Carceri, and the Outlands. Some estimated that the Abyss had 666 layers, while the Fraternity of Order claimed to have catalogued 679 layers. It was possible that the number of layers was infinite, but no one could be certain. The first layer, named Pazunia after the demon lord Pazuzu, was described as a barren, dusty place baking under a red sun, broken only by great iron fortresses, huge holes in the ground, and the river Styx. Some branches of the Styx flowed down the holes (which were conduits to the various layers) and some of these holes supplied water to the Styx in reverse waterfalls.
When the Great Wheel model was replaced by the World Tree cosmology model, the river Styx was renamed the River of Blood and it flowed through all the fiendish planes (except for the Supreme Throne and the Demonweb Pits) originating in the Abyss, passing through the Blood Rift&mdashan unusual plane that connected the Abyss with the Nine Hells&mdashbringing the demons even closer to their arch-enemies the devils, resulting in the Blood War. Cosmologists found evidence of portals between the Abyss and the Barrens of Doom and Despair, Clangor, the Demonweb Pits, and Hammergrim, with intermittent portals to Deep Caverns and Fated Depths.

After the Spellplague, Asmodeus consumed the essence of the fallen Azuth and ended the Blood War by casting the Abyss to the furthest depths of the Elemental Chaos. The World Axis cosmology described the ruined Abyss as a domain with ever-changing features and realms, where the demons waged futile wars over meaningless empires. Once again the river Styx flowed through the Nine Hells and the Abyss, but then emptied its pollution into the Astral Sea. Other than the Styx or braving the Elemental Chaos, the only known passages to the Abyss were found in the Demonweb Pits, the Dismal Caverns, and Nishrek.

The number of layers in the Abyss was unknown and perhaps unknowable, with at least 679 having been catalogued but this article attempts to list them regardless of which cosmology model was in favor at the time of discovery. Each layer had its own characteristics, which were as varied as the demons themselves. All types of terrain, atmosphere, weather, gravity, and material composition were represented in the myriad layers. Some examples were
* Air-dominant&mdashzero gravity, no matter except air
* Ash&mdashblowing dunes of ashes
* Battleground&mdashBlood War or other
* City&mdashwarrens and slums to citadels and palaces, teeming with demons
* Earth-dominant&mdashsolid rock tunneled by the inhabitants
* Fire-dominant&mdasheverburning flames with salamanders, etc.
* Delusion&mdashappears to be Normal but the flowers are poisonous or the trees attack
* Desert&mdashendless tracts of black, white, or red sand with no water
* Glacier&mdashinfinite black, white, or orange ice with few rocky peaks breaking the surface
* Hellscape&mdasha burning mix of magma, rock, and belching brimstone
* Maelstrom&mdashswirling, bubbling chaos like Limbo
* Mountainous&mdashrocky crags, precipitous cliffs, soaring peaks
* Negative-dominant&mdashmajor or minor
* Normal&mdashsimilar to a Prime plane with various flora and fauna
* Ocean&mdasha trackless ocean, with a surface
* Salt&mdashcrystalline badlands or desert
* Sea&mdashof acid, blood, garbage, insects, oil, or worms, etc.
* Swamp&mdashnoisome bog inhabited by predators
* Undead&mdashspecters, spooks, and ghosts
* Volcanic&mdashlava flows, earthquakes, volcanoes, and smoke
* Water-dominant&mdashnightmarish creatures in the murk
Despite its name and notoriety for being never-ending, it was not known whether the layers of the Abyss were truly infinite in number.The Abyss is often listed as infinite but so are the other Outer Planes, or, as per Manual of the Planes 3rd edition, "at least so large that they may as well be infinite." Part of the reason for this was that some places might have been so absolutely inhospitable that none, not mortal, nor god, nor demon lords themselves could survive (the deeper layers reportedly having been even worse in the past), and hence were not known about.
While the hundreds of layers of the Abyss might seem to utterly eclipse all other Outer planes put together, this figure was misleading. Besides the issue of uninhabitability, layers and divine realms, the personal territories of powers, were often one in the same in the Abyss, whereas other planes often had several realms on one layer.

In the very depths of the Abyss, the heart of the plane was constantly cleaving through the primal foundations of the cosmos, as it had since before the dawn of mortals, spawning new layers. Conversely, the Abyss was also capable of losing layers. The individual layers of the Abyss had primal urges and a constant need for nourishment, shrinking and weakened until nothing was left if not fed. Alternatively, they might be absorbed by other layers, only able to escape this state by acquiring sufficient sustenance. Occassionally the battling of demons over control of a layer could become so cataclysmic that the entire realm was outright obliterated.
Layers could also be intentionally removed, such as when Lolth expended much of her divine energy seperating the Demonweb Pits, or when a pantheon of offended deities ripped out and condensed a demon lords entire layer (with him still in it) and cast it into the Astral plane. Despite this ending in the Abyss, much like a hungry, rudely awakened beast, almost instantly striking down the entire pantheon in that case, the attack itself was successful, leaving nothing but a void and their own decomposing divine corpses.
It was also a possibility that destroyed layers were capable of being reborn elsewhere in the Abyss, although this was not a certainty. This was ignoring the fact that layers were shaped by the conscious manipulations and subconscious wills of its resident demon lord, and so even the nature of a single layer could become obsolete by the time such information was established.
There were myriad types of demons, too numerous to catalog here, but including the tanarri, obyriths, and loumaras. Non-demonic life could be found in the Abyss as well, with both mortal explorers and captives and the petitioners brought there after death. Many wicked deities also based themselves here.
Beliefs about the journey of souls to the afterlife changed with the shifting cosmologies and the crystal sphere in which one resided. In some worlds, chaotic evil souls would travel directly to the Abyss and become manes, the lowest form of sub-demon. Manes were treated as slaves, cannon fodder, and food by the demon lords. For mortals of Realmspace, however,  all souls would first go to the Fugue Plane and await transport to their final resting place. Greedy demon lords would open a portal to the Fugue Plane and conduct raids to steal souls and bring them back to the Abyss to become manes. After the Spellplague, Shar reshaped the Plane of Shadow and folded in what death energy did not get absorbed into the Elemental Chaos and created the Shadowfell. After that, souls on their way to the afterlife started their journey in the Shadowfell and most made it to the Fugue Plane to await judgment, but a few remained behind or were lost.
Relatively few greater powers carved out a realm in the Abyss because dealing with the ubiquitous hordes of demons and ambitious demon lords would require too much of their attention. Those deities for whom the chaotic evil nature of the Abyss was attractive at some point in time, along with the demon "royalty" whose names were not spoken openly in civil society, were
* Ahazu the Seizer.
* Baphomet created an Endless Maze that changed form as it passed between layers. It was populated by a variety of minotaurs said to have breath weapons or magical abilities.

* Eltab lurked on this plane in the "Hidden Layer".
* Fraz-Urbluu had a realm that reportedly rivaled the beauty of the Twin Paradises or Arvandor but it was an illusion covering decay and rotting flesh.
* Garyx the All-Destroyer, dragon god of fire, made his lair somewhere in the Abyss.The more recent but Core source Races of the Dragon places Garyx in Pandemonium instead, which more closely fits his alignment between chaotic evil and chaotic neutral.

* Grolantor, god of the hill giants, stayed in the Abyss when not in his realm in Tarterus.
* Juiblex lived in a layer full of fungus and rot, where slimes and molds fed off the decaying matter of the plane, and each other.
* Kali, the feared Black Earth Mother of the Vedic pantheon, held sway over both the 500th layer, and the Caverns of the Skull, the 663rd layer.
* Kostchtchie controlled only part of a layer, but his ice palace was filled with creatures of cold.
* Laogzed, god of troglodytes, had a realm called the Rotting Plain here.
* Lolth spun her webs on the 65th layer in the midst of a maelstrom that was the portal to her abode on the 66th layer before she became a greater god and removed her Demonweb Pits from the Abyss to join the fiendish planes. After the Spellplague her realm survived to float in the Astral Sea.
* Merrshaulk, the ancient yuan-ti deity, resided on the 74 layer called Smaragd.

* The Queen of Chaos ruled the fourteenth layer called the Steaming Fen.
* Ramenos, the deity of the bullywugs, slumbered on the 74 layer most of the time, sharing Merrshaulks realm of Smaragd.
