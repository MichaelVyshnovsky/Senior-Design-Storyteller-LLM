        "mainbody": "'''Krigala''' was the first and topmost layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. It was called '''Selera's Empire''', because it was bathed in perpertual sunlight from the Beastlands' sun, [[Selera]].",
        "Description": "Krigala was a heavily forested layer with trees of all sorts of varieties. The main way in which Krigala differed from the other two layers was its sky. It was perpetually noon in Krigala, with the bright sun directly overhead and never moving. The sun appeared to be at its highest point in the sky no matter how far one might travel. Time did pass, but the sun gave no indication of this; instead, time could be tracked by the fact that precipitation of some form fell exactly once per twenty-four hour period.\n\nDespite the fact that it was always midday, the layer had a variety of climates, and these climates cover the layer with no apparent organization. Deserts and savannahs were cooked by Selera's heat. Other areas were in the shade of massive and thick jungle canopy. Some regions were covered in fog; others even had snow. For the most part, however, it was just warm enough for all of the vast plant life. The temperature decreased as one climbed higher in altitude, as on the [[Material Plane]].\n\nThe River [[Oceanus]] flowed through the center of Krigala in a relatively straight path, from [[Elysium]] and to [[Arborea]]. When the river did curve, bayous and oxbow lakes were formed. Some of the largest trees were able to bridge the river with their massive branches. Similarly, some of the largest herds and most powerful predators lived close to the waters. The current was strong, and the river was marked in places by white-water rapids.\n\nIt was possible to physically move from Krigala to [[Brux]], the second plane. Such portals were invisible and seemingly random. The layers overlapped each other in a similar manner to how the [[Transitive Planes]] overlapped the Prime Material plane, so one could be walking beneath an archway formed by a large branch and suddenly find her- or himself in the twilight of Brux instead of the eternal day of Krigala without any other change in the immediate environment. Some such portals were found along narrow cliff trails, and these cliffs were sometimes considered the border between the two layers. The interlayer portals tended to be one way, so turning around to walk back under that same branch or up that same cliff path would not likely return the noonday sun. Fortunately, interlayer portals were very common, so it was not too difficult to find an alternate path back to Krigala.\n\nPortals to Arborea, Elysium, and the [[Outlands]] were also present, usually appearing as openings in large, hollow trees. The same type of tree always led to the same plane. For example, silver-plated [[beech]] trees that were portals always led to Arborea, as did lightning-blasted [[oak]]s. [[Sequoia]]s connected to Elysium. The portals shifted frequently, so what used to be a portal on one day might be nothing but a dead tree on another. Branches of [[Yggdrasil]] also touched this layer, hidden in deep forests atop high mountains. Here also, a ''gate'' to [[Ysgard]] was rumored to be guarded by a [[per]] servant of [[Heimdall]], while other pers guarded [[color pool]]s around Yggdrasil's branches and [[ratatosk]] protected the mystical tree itself.\n\nTo reach Krigala with the ''[[plane shift]]'' spell required a [[gold]] planar fork tuned to the note of F.{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|42-43}}",

            "Realms": "* [[Filchnest]] was the divine realm of the [[Kenku (winged)|kenku]] deity [[Quorlinn]].\n* The [[Forbidden Plateau (divine realm)|Forbidden Plateau]] was an isolated ecosystem full of [[dinosaur]]s and other large, \"prehistoric\" life. [[Thard Harr]], lord of the [[Wild dwarf|jungle dwarves]], also resided here between his wanderings.\n* [[Goldenroost]] was the realm of [[Remnis]], god of the [[giant eagle]]s.\n* The [[Grove of the Unicorns]], the [[divine realm]] of [[Mielikki]], was located here.\n* The [[High Glade]], [[Shiallia]]'s realm, was nearby.\n* The [[Pridelands]] of [[Nobanion]], King of the Beasts, contained a portal connecting Krigala with the [[Gulthmere Forest]] in [[Faer√ªn]].\n* [[Skerrit]], god of [[centaur]]s also ruled in this layer, his actual realm called [[Skerrit's Glade]] almost unnoticeable from the surrounding woods."

        "Inhabitants": "All manner of [[:Category:Diurnal creatures|diurnal]] [[Celestial creature|celestial]] [[animal]]s inhabited this layer. These animals were more intelligent than animals from the Material and able to speak, but they were still animals in their outlook and manner of life. Most of them knew how the interlayer portals worked and could instinctively avoid them if desired.\n\nSkerrit's centaur [[petitioner]]s also were found on this layer, living in small huts or lean-tos."
