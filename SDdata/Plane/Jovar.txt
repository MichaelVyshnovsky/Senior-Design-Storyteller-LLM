'''Jovar''', also known as the '''Glittering Heaven''' and '''Heaven of Gems''', was the sixth layer of [[Mount Celestia]].

==Geography==
Jovar was covered in hills that were studded with precious gemstones that glittered in the light.

==Government==
Jovar was ruled by [[Sealtiel]], the Defender. He was charged with preventing incursions into [[Chronias]] and defending against the machinations of [[fiend]]s. He was also patron of [[warden archon]]s.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Yetsira]] : The Heavenly City. A huge seven-layered ziggurat that displayed a large staircase on each face connecting the terraces of each layer. The stones that made up the city were made of precious gemstones, similar to those seen around the surrounding hills. On the topmost terrace was the bridge of [[al-Sihal]], formed of pure light, where the portal to the topmost layer of Celestia, [[Chronias]], was located. It was guarded by a powerful [[solar]] named [[Xerona]] who judged who was allowed to enter.
