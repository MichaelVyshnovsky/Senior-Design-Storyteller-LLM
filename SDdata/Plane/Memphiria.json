        "mainbody": "emphiria was the divine domain of the Pharaonic and Mulhorandi deity of death, Osiris.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, Memphiria was one of the three triangular divine realms that made up Heliopolis. Under the World Tree cosmology, it was likewise part of Heliopolis, which in that cosmology was a neutral plane that was shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, undead were deprived of their special innate abilities while in Memphiria. For example, the mummies of this realm did not produce mummy rot.\nIn both cosmologies Memphiria was a desert realm,\n* Memphiria A residential city built of white marble, which was rather lacking in terms of goods and services. In the World Tree cosmology, it was said to be a grand necropolis surrounded by rows of mausoleums.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, this divine realm was also primarily inhabited by petitioners. They moved slowly about their business and werent as lively as the petitioners elsewhere in Heliopolis, but were still largely content with their lot in life. Underground, the spirits of kings who ruled wisely in life ruled over the spirits that had served them in life.\nBeyond petitioners, his realm in the Great Wheel was inhabited by mummies (though they were not evil) and a variety of other undead creatures that were not of evil alignment. The mummies of this realm would rise up to seek vengeance upon those who despoiled their graves, while other undead came to the realm in order to complete some form of quest or out of a desire to reclaim some semblance of a normal, mortal life. The petitioners of this realm treated the undead no different from the living, through they would fearlessly attack any undead that was evil.\nIn the World Tree cosmology, his realm was said to be inhabited solely by petitioners of Mulhorandi origin, though these petitioners were all non-evil corporeal forms of undead.\n* Khallis Mhektis The fair, wise, and impartial half-elf proxy of Osiris who ruled over the city of Memphiria. They had a sorrowful look to them and their only motivation was to serve Osiris well."
