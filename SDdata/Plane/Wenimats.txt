Wenimats was the demiplane where the gods and goddesses of the Azuposi people dwelt.
The Azuposi described Wenimats as the most beautiful of all mountains. It was full of lakes, spring-fed streams, rich forests, and sun-lit meadows. At its center was a massive basin full of water, from which the shiwannas drew water to water the surface of the Pasocada Basin.
Wenimats was connected to Brux, the second layer of The Beastlands by the Sun Trail, a mystical road of aromatic cornmeal and pollen that wove its way through the Astral Plane and also connected Wenimats to the Material Plane at a holy site called Dunobo Springs.
The demiplane was created by the Spider Woman, the oldest of the Azuposi spirits, along with her lover, the Sun Father. The Azuposi also believed her responsible for the creation of the whole world of Toril.
