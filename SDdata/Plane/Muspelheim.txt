'''Muspelheim''' was the second layer of [[Ysgard]]. A jagged land of fire and volcanic rock, it was named after the [[divine realm]] of [[Surtr]] that existed within its lands.

==Geography==
Muspelheim was formed by similar [[Earthmote|earthberg]]s to those that constituted the first layer, [[Ysgard (layer)|Ysgard]], but they were inverted with respect to those. In Muspelheim, the [[fire]]-lit side faced up, so most of the terrain in the entire layer was dominated by fire and was quite inhospitable to visitors. In many ways, it was very similar to some regions of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], which was connected to the layer via numerous portals.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Muspelheim (realm)|Muspelheim]], realm of [[Surtr]]. It contained some of the few arable lands of the entire layer, which were used to grow [[fireweed]], [[verdobba]], and a type of edible black wood.

==Inhabitants==
Since it was such a desolate place, Muspelheim was generally avoided. Only its native [[fire giant]]s remained to care for the land and were its undisputed rulers.
