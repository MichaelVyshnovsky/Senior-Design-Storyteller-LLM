        "mainbody": "'''Arvandor''', sometimes called '''Olympus''', was the first layer of [[Arborea]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. It contained the realms of [[Arvandor]], [[Olympus]], and [[Brightwater]].",
        "Description": "Arvandor was a place of endless forests and open spaces. It had a day-night cycle similar to the one on [[Toril]], with a sun, a moon, and stars. Hunting challenges were practiced during the day, while feasts were held and stories were told around campfires during the warm nights. Enormous [[redwood]]s and [[oak]]s formed forests dotted by orchards, [[grape]] and [[wheat]] fields, and settlements.",
        "Locations": "The three realms within Arvandor were separated from each other by enormous expanses of wilderness and hills that dwarfed most mountains in the [[Prime Material plane]].\n\nThe layer was perhaps best known for its homonymous realm of [[Arvandor]], an arboreal expanse of glades, forests, and groves that harbored [[Corellon]]'s tower, the [[Evergold]], the town of [[Grandfather Oak]],{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited|13}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"hgs-location\">The phrasing indicates that the [[House of Glowing Stars]] is located within the joint realm of the [[Seldarine]], [[Arvandor]]. It is not explicitly stated that  Arvandor here does not refer to the layer in general. But as the layer is usually called Olympus outside Forgotten Realms sources, it seems likely. and the palace of [[Mythralan]],{{Cite dragon/251/Magic of the Seldarine|30}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"myt-location\">[[Dragon magazine 251]] states that [[Mythrien Sarath]]'s realm of [[Mythralan]] is located in the layer of Arvandor, but does not say if it is within or outside the joint realm of the [[Seldarine]], [[Arvandor]]. with [[Aerdrie Faenya]]'s [[Aerie (realm)|floating palace]] drifting above. This was the realm of the [[Seldarine]], and their final resting place.\n\nThe second realm was called [[Olympus]]. Its fields were more pastoral and tamed than Arvandor, inviting the accomplishment of epic deeds.\n\nThe third realm of Arvandor was [[Brightwater]], a fully urban realm in which recklessness, luck, and impulsiveness ruled the day. It was the divine realm of [[Tymora]], [[Lliira]], and [[Sune]].\n\nIn the valley between Olympus and Arvandor, near the realm of Brightwater, stood the [[Gilded Hall]] of the [[Sensates]], a large palace of domes and towers where constant parties were held. Known to the elves as Perlamia, the Gilded Hall was also a place of healing.<ref name=PC-TL2e-p22\">",
        "Inhabitants": "The main inhabitants of the settled areas of Arvandor were [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]]. The wilderness was also inhabited by [[centaur]]s and [[nymph]]s. The unsettled areas of Arvandor were inhabited by [[giant]]s and [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] seeking to challenge adventurers."
