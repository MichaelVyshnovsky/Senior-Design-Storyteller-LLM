        "Inhabitants": "Unlike the divine realms of the Halfling pantheon's other members, Soulearth lacked [[petitioner]]s of its own. Rather, the only creatures one could find there were the [[spirit]]s of halflings, which typically came to Soulearth upon their death and waited for Urogalan to assign them their proper place in the afterlife."
