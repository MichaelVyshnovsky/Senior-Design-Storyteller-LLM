In the World Tree cosmology, the place was located in the Barrens of Doom and Despair.
The symbol of Talona, which her palace imitated
The palace was a pyramid-shaped thing that looked like the symbol of Talona. It was in the middle of a hot and humid marshland that was full of parasites, mosquitoes, biting midge swarms, infectious agents, and so on. This was unique, as it was impossible for life of any form to live on the Barrens of Doom and Despair.
Talona ruled the realm.
