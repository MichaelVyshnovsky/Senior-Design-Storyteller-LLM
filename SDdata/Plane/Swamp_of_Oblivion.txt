The '''Swamp of Oblivion''', also known as the '''Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze''', was the [[Inner Plane]] at the intersection of the Planes of [[Elemental Plane of Earth|Earth]] and [[Elemental Plane of Water|Water]]. It was a place of slime and mud.

|See!? It does look like a wall of [[chocolate]]! Xanxos ''likes'' chocolate, especially when it's dribbled over raw [[elf]]. Are you an elf? Hey, come back here!

==Geography==
The plane was a vast swamp populated by [[hag]]s and twisted [[tree]]s. Few settlements existed in the place, built atop high stilts that kept constructions above the mud. However, since there was no solid ground underneath, everything eventually sank into the swamp.

Objects thrown into the swamp were rumored to disappear into the mud for at least a century. For that reason, powerful [[artifact]]s were occasionally thrown in the swamp by someone desperate to remove them from the [[multiverse]] for a time.

At the border with the Plane of Earth, a hill range known as the [[Mud Hills]] were constantly eroded by the Swamp of Oblivion and regenerated by the Plane of Earth.
===Flora & Fauna===
Some of the few animals known to be found on this plane included [[leech]]es and enormous swarms of mosquitoes.
