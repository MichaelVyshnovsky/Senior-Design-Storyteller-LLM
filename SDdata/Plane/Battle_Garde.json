But following defeat at the hands of Tempus, Garagoss disposition changed and he no longer felt comfortable in Limbo, so moved his realm to the second layer of Pandemonium.\nAccording to the World Tree cosmology, Garagos nomadically roamed the celestial plane of Warriors Rest and declared whatever region he happened to be in as Battle Garde."
