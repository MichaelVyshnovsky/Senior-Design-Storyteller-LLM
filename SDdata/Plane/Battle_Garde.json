        "mainbody": "Battle Garde was the divine realm of Garagos, a Faer√ªnian demigod of war.\nTo those who subscribed to the Great Wheel cosmology, Battle Garde was said to be originally located in the plane known as Limbo. But following defeat at the hands of Tempus, Garagoss disposition changed and he no longer felt comfortable in Limbo, so moved his realm to the second layer of Pandemonium.\nAccording to the World Tree cosmology, Garagos nomadically roamed the celestial plane of Warriors Rest and declared whatever region he happened to be in as Battle Garde."
