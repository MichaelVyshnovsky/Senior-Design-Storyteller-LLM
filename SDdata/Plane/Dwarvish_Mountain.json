        "mainbody": "The '''Dwarvish Mountain''', sometimes known as the '''Dwarven Mountain''', was a subterranean realm in the [[Outlands]]. It was the shared [[divine realm]] of [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], [[Dumathoin]], and [[Vergadain]], according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].",
        "Description": "The outside of the mountain, which was not considered part of the realm itself, was a dangerous and icy slope where few people ventured. The only settlement on the mountain was the [[human]] town of [[Ironridge]], located next to the entrance to Vergadain's realm. It had a population of about 500 people, who traded with the realm's inhabitants and occasionally sought entrance to its halls.\n\nThe underground realm epitomized the three greatest passions of the [[dwarf|dwarven]] lifestyle: exploration, hard work, and revelry. Each aspect was most clearly manifest in its respective realm, with all three combined to provide its dwarf inhabitants with utmost happiness.",
        "Cosmography": "A ''[[portal]]'' in the city of [[Berronar's Side]] connected the realm of [[Erackinor]] in [[Solania]] to the Dwarvish Mountain.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Deepshaft Hall]], realm of Dumathoin. A cold and dark realm of roughly dug tunnels and stale air. It was located close to the [[Caverns of Thought]] and a few unmarked tunnels connected to [[Ilsensine]]'s realm.\n* [[Soot Hall]], realm of Dugmaren. It was filled with libraries and always bustling with activity.\n* [[Strongale Hall]], realm of Vergadain. A lively place of betting and gambling."
