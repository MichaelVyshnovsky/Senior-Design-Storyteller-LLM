        "Description": "Cathrys looked like a string of planet-sized beads, or orbs, but without a string. The distance between two orbs was about {{SI|500|mi|k|long=yes}}. The orbs were smaller than the ones in [[Othrys]].",
        "Features": "The orbs of Cathrys were full of vibrant plant life. Some parts were covered in a red jungle that stank of rot and decay and whose plants secreted [[acid]]. The smell was very strong but ultimately harmless, but the acid was a different matter. The acid was so corrosive that it destroyed metal in one to ten minutes, leather in one to four minutes, and it was lethally dangerous to any creature that did not develop a protection against it, like the natives who developed it by never bathing and therefore gaining a protective sheen on their skin.\n\nOther landscapes included plains and dry grassland. The grass was razor-sharp and thought to be a lesser version of [[razorvine]]. Maintaining roads was vital for survival, otherwise people were in danger of being cut to death by the tall grass. It was possible to avoid this fate by applying protection against it. These grasslands were considered the habitable parts of Cathrys.",
