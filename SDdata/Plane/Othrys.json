        "mainbody": "Othrys, also called Orthrys or Titans Home, was the first layer of Carceri.\nOthrys looked like a string of planet-sized beads, or orbs, but without a string. The distance between two orbs was about .\nCompared to the other layers of Carceri, Othrys had few natural hazards.\nOthrys was mostly swampland. The Styx and other waters eroded the ground, producing bogs and quicksand fields that were between  deep and that glowed with green light that was often hidden by green grass. However, dry land existed in the form of mountains. They were often inhabited by the Titans. These mountains were sometimes tall enough to touch other orbs mountain peaks, as in the case of Mount Othrys.\nThe swamps had swarms of mosquitoes and other insects. A means to protect against these insects was a local plant called stinkweed that could be rubbed on the body. However, rubbing it on the body worked like a stinking cloud that knocked out a person for one to four minutes.\nThe air of Othrys was dangerous to the mind. Inhaling it over an extended period&mdasha week or two&mdashresulted in a person becoming more intelligent but also egotistic and scheming. This effect wore off after spending about the same time outside of Othrys.\nHowever, Othryss most dangerous feature was its music. This music sounded like it was played on slightly off-kilter bells and made people believe that it led to their hearts desire. According to the only one who managed to come back from hearing it, a person by the name Vyaki, the music led outside of the string of orbs to a gulf where monsters older than the Titans lived.\nIn Carceri, the Styx ran only in Othrys. It ran freely, causing the ground of Othrys to be filled with its memory-loss magic.\nMount Olympus also connected to the layer close to the Titans realm in Mount Othrys, but that route was usually avoided by travelers. Since the Titans could not use the mountain to escape, so they resented any visitors coming in that way. Through Mount Olympus, the layer was once linked to the Arvandor layer of Arborea,\nVillages in Othrys were generally built on stilts in the swamp. This was because the dry parts were often controlled by the Titans and people preferred the dangers of the swamp over the ones posed by the Titans. Each of these villages had their own government and diplomatic relationships with other villages. However, raiding and betrayal were common. The latter erupted into particularly bloody battles.\nBastion of Last Hope\n The headquarters of the Revolutionary League, the Bastion of the Last Hope was a place where people could buy any form of forged documents, plastic surgery for disguise, and other services for deception.\nMount Othrys\n Mount Othrys was the home of of the Greater Titans, the eleven children of Uranus and Gaea. In particular, Mount Othrys held Cronuss palace.\nStones of Draetilus An ancient circle of stones atop a small, open hill that sat deep in the planes swamps. Each of the stones acted as a portal, with destinations including the Prime Material, the Mungoth layer of Gehenna, and Sigil. Both the baatezu and tanarri knew of the site and wish they could capture it for the Blood War, but it was a difficult position to hold. The former tried twice to capture the hill and set up a garrison, but their forces were destroyed by either the local trolls or Cronus.\nThe Titans lived on Othrys and were sought out for their advice and some people actually got it from them.\nThe petitioners of Othrys were the souls of people who used lies to gain power, like traitors to their own countries, politicians, religious frauds, and so on. They were all very charismatic and smooth talkers but also compulsive liars who hoped to betray others with their lies.\nAt some point trolls were imported to Othrys from the Prime Material and took up residence in its swamps, where they bred prolifically and lurked like alligators. They kept to the swamps and never went into the mountains, for they favored the terrain and because the Titans did not want the trolls in their vicinity. They were known to prey upon unwary petitioners that wandered away from their stilt villages."
