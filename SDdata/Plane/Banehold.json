There was no water to be found anywhere on the plane (except for the [[River of Blood]]), and no sunlight filled the blood-red sky.",

        "Structure": "The Barrens of Doom and Despair consisted of a single infinite plane in Gehenna. There were no constituent layers. It linked via the [[Astral Plane]] to the planes of the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime Material]] (such as [[Toril]]) and a number of portals directly connected it with [[Hammergrim]] and the [[Blood Rift]]. Beshaba's realm, the [[Blood Tor]], linked directly to the [[Abyss]]."
