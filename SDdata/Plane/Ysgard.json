        "mainbody": "e three layers of Gladsheim consisted of tremendous rivers of earth and stone that formed cosmic arches through the void, like very tightly packed asteroid belts. Millions of miles/kilometers wide, each river was made up of gigantic chunks of matter that bumped and ground against each other at a glacial but noticeable pace, raising up mountains and opening vast chasms. These \"earthbergs\" all shared the same gravity field and most were inhabitable on the top side while the underside of the rivers burned with a radiant fire that provided a ruddy light to the rivers below. Earthquakes and landslides were a commonly occurring danger in Gladsheim as the landscape slowly buckled and broke under the influence of chaos.\n\nMultiple rough-hewn landings of the [[Infinite Staircase]] connected to each of Gladsheim's three layers.\n\n===Ysgard===\n{{/Imagemap}}\n{{Main|Ysgard (layer)}}\nThe name of this layer was also the name of the confederation of godly domains known as [[Asgard]], home of the Norse pantheon, The usual ''color pools'' connecting Asgard to the Astral Plane existed but were little used. Portals in the guise of wells connected this layer to the neighboring planes of [[Arborea]], [[Limbo]], and [[Concordant Opposition]]. In addition to Yggdrasil, the Norse gods controlled and carefully guarded a portal directly to the Prime plane where they were the strongest, called the Bifrost or the rainbow bridge.\n\nOther known realms adjacent to Asgard were [[Vanaheim]] (home of the [[vanir]]), [[Alfheim]] (fairyland, known for its chaotic elven spirits), and Jotenheim (home of the giants).\n\n===Muspelheim===\n{{Main|Muspelheim}}\nThe earthbergs of this layer were reversed (or alternatively, gravity was reversed) so the flaming side was up and the earthen side down. [[Surtur]] and the [[fire giant]]s made their home here and guarded the barriers that lead to Asgard and its neighboring realms.\n\n===Nidavellir===\n{{Main|Nidavellir}}\nThe rivers of earth were in such close proximity in this layer that the entire sky was filled with fire, making it appear to travelers that they were in underground caverns and passages with a river of fire for a ceiling.",
