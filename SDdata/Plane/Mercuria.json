        "Description": "The air in Mercuria was very thin, which could make unaccustomed creatures dizzy until their bodies adapted to it. The mountainous landscape included high mountains and deep valleys, carved by rivers that ran fast down the gentle slopes. Although flatlands and prairies were uncommon, Mercuria had several high plateaus on which most settlements were located. The entire layer was constantly bathed in golden light.\n\nThe layer also served as the armory of Mount Celestia, as well as the gathering place for its troops. It was also the site of numerous mausoleums dedicated to fallen noble warriors. Their memory was honored annually during the Day of Memory by all inhabitants of Mercuria.",

It existed simultaneously in the first four layers of Mount Celestia, moving between them at Bahamut's will, and could be used by travelers that were friendly to Bahamut as a fast passage between the layers.",
