        "mainbody": "Mercuria, also known as the Golden Heaven, was the second layer of Mount Celestia.\nThe air in Mercuria was very thin, which could make unaccustomed creatures dizzy until their bodies adapted to it. The mountainous landscape included high mountains and deep valleys, carved by rivers that ran fast down the gentle slopes. Although flatlands and prairies were uncommon, Mercuria had several high plateaus on which most settlements were located. The entire layer was constantly bathed in golden light.\nThe layer also served as the armory of Mount Celestia, as well as the gathering place for its troops. It was also the site of numerous mausoleums dedicated to fallen noble warriors. Their memory was honored annually during the Day of Memory by all inhabitants of Mercuria.\nBahamuts Palace The divine realm of Bahamut, this enormous palace was built entirely out of the platinum dragons hoard. It existed simultaneously in the first four layers of Mount Celestia, moving between them at Bahamuts will, and could be used by travelers that were friendly to Bahamut as a fast passage between the layers.\nTrueheart The realm of Torm.\nUndying Flame The realm of the Untheric deity Girru.\nRadiant Light The realm of Amaterasu of the Eight Million Gods."
