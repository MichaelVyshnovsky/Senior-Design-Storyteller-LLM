Chronias, also known as the Illuminated Heaven, was the seventh and final layer of Mount Celestia.
Little was known of its structure because nothing was ever recorded by the few who had visited and returned. The legends said that Chronias was so good and lawful that it glowed of its own accord and any who entered had all evil and neutrality burned out of them, leaving them inherently goodâ€”if they survived.
The ruler of Chronias was Zaphkiel, the Watcher. He was the first archon created and leader of the Hebdomad.
