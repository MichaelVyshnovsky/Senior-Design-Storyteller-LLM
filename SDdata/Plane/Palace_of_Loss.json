        "Description": "The Palace of Loss was a tower with neither windows nor doors. Only Shar's [[petitioner]]s and servants knew the way to enter or exit the tower.",
        "Inhabitants": "Besides her servants and worshipers, within the tower were kept her prisoners who desired freedom above all else. Thus, Shar could enjoy their pain more fully.",
        "History": "When the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] was the dominant view of the planes, the Palace of Loss was located in [[Niflheim]], the second layer of [[Hades]], before it was relocated in the Plane of Shadow of the [[World Tree cosmology]].\n\nAfter the Spellplague, the Palace of Loss was destroyed, leaving behind a gaping dark hole, much like an inverted tower, called the '''Foundation of Loss'''. The hole formed a magical portal to her new home in the [[Towers of Night]] in the [[Astral Sea]]. The Foundation was surrounded by a sense of sorrow so strong it could be felt, and the area attracted many evil beings of darkness from the [[Shadowfell]]."
