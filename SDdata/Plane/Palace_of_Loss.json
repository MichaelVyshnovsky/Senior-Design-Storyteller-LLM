        "mainbody": "he Palace of Loss was the abode of the goddess Shar, located on the Plane of Shadow. before the Spellplague.\nThe Palace of Loss was a tower with neither windows nor doors. Only Shars petitioners and servants knew the way to enter or exit the tower.\nBesides her servants and worshipers, within the tower were kept her prisoners who desired freedom above all else. Thus, Shar could enjoy their pain more fully.\nWhen the Great Wheel cosmology was the dominant view of the planes, the Palace of Loss was located in Niflheim, the second layer of Hades, before it was relocated in the Plane of Shadow of the World Tree cosmology.\nAfter the Spellplague, the Palace of Loss was destroyed, leaving behind a gaping dark hole, much like an inverted tower, called the Foundation of Loss. The hole formed a magical portal to her new home in the Towers of Night in the Astral Sea. The Foundation was surrounded by a sense of sorrow so strong it could be felt, and the area attracted many evil beings of darkness from the Shadowfell."
