The '''Citadel of Thought''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Deep Duerra]]. It was located in the [[Thuldanin]] layer of [[Acheron]] according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], while in the [[World Tree cosmology]] it was considered to be part of [[Hammergrim]].

==Cosmography==
According to the World Tree cosmology, the Citadel of Thought was a hall located in the courtyard of Hammergrim.

==Inhabitants==
The underground of the Citadel of Thought contained vast catacombs composed of fiery tunnels, populated by [[ember guard]]s made in Hammergrim whose job was to torture any [[duergar]] who had offended Deep Duerra in some way.
