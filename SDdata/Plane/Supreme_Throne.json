        "Geography": "Much like the rest of Cocytus, the Supreme Throne was a barren realm where howling winds could drive mortals mad. Because Cyric was the enemy of all other faiths, the followers of any deity besides Cyric found their spells more difficult to cast on the plane.\n\nThe Shattered Castle was a twisted and ruined fortress that first served as Cyric's seat of power, and as his prison afterwards. It was called the \"Castle of the Supreme Throne\" only by Cyric himself.",
        "History": "According to a thrall captured by [[mind flayer]]s of [[Oryndoll]] beneath [[Andalbruin]], the Supreme Throne was originally established as a kingdom in the plane of [[Limbo]] by [[batrachi]] who had left [[Toril]] after around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. There, the deity called [[Ramenos]] once again changed the batrachi to serve his goals.\n\nThe Shattered Castle was then moved by Cyric Cyric, driven mad, abandoned Bone Castle in Hades and established his new realm in Cocytus as a twisted, ever-changing fortress, which served as his base from where he hatched his plans to conquer [[Toril]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, after Cyric murdered Mystra and triggered the [[Spellplague]], Lathander, Sune, and Tyr decreed that Cyric be imprisoned in the Supreme Throne for 1000 years.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Supreme Throne was the home plane of [[chaos beast]]s, [[demodand]]s, [[howler]]s, and [[slaad]]i.\n\nSince its inception in Limbo, the realm was inhabited by [[batrachi]]. Among them was [[Bazim-Gorag]], the Firebringer.<ref>",
        "Rumors & Legends": "A rumor existed that seven black [[iron]] keys were required to free Cyric from his shackles within his prison."
