        "mainbody": "The Supreme Throne was a Fiendish plane in the World Tree cosmology and an Astral dominion in the World Axis cosmology. \nAccording to the Great Wheel cosmology, the Shattered Castle was a realm within Cocytus, the second layer of Pandemonium,\nMuch like the rest of Cocytus, the Supreme Throne was a barren realm where howling winds could drive mortals mad. Because Cyric was the enemy of all other faiths, the followers of any deity besides Cyric found their spells more difficult to cast on the plane.\nThe Shattered Castle was a twisted and ruined fortress that first served as Cyrics seat of power, and as his prison afterwards. It was called the \"Castle of the Supreme Throne\" only by Cyric himself.\nAccording to a thrall captured by mind flayers of Oryndoll beneath Andalbruin, the Supreme Throne was originally established as a kingdom in the plane of Limbo by batrachi who had left Toril after around . There, the deity called Ramenos once again changed the batrachi to serve his goals.\nThe Shattered Castle was then moved by Cyric Cyric, driven mad, abandoned Bone Castle in Hades and established his new realm in Cocytus as a twisted, ever-changing fortress, which served as his base from where he hatched his plans to conquer Toril.\nIn the , after Cyric murdered Mystra and triggered the Spellplague, Lathander, Sune, and Tyr decreed that Cyric be imprisoned in the Supreme Throne for 1000 years.\nThe Supreme Throne was the home plane of chaos beasts, demodands, howlers, and slaadi.\nSince its inception in Limbo, the realm was inhabited by batrachi. Among them was Bazim-Gorag, the Firebringer.\nA rumor existed that seven black iron keys were required to free Cyric from his shackles within his prison."
