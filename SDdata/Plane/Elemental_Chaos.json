        "mainbody": "The '''Elemental Chaos''' was an [[Inner Plane]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], located at the far reaches of the elemental planes, where the elements dissolved into a single mix of colliding energies. In the [[World Axis cosmology]]— which is the cosmotology of the planes post-[[Spellplague]]—it was the [[fundamental plane]] within which were contained all of the former [[elemental plane]]s and [[energy plane]]s, as well as the planes of [[Limbo]] and the [[Abyss]].\n\nA tempestuous sea of ever-changing terrain and clashing elements, with stability only enforced in isolated locations, the Elemental Chaos was ruled over, at least in name if not fact, by the [[primordial]]s and was the equal and opposite of its divine counterpart, the [[Astral Sea]], as the primordials were the opposites of the [[deity|god]]s as [[demon]]s were to [[devil]]s.\n\nIn spite of its chaotic and dangerous landscape, most parts of the Chaos were relatively easy to travel through, or at least as much as most other planes.",
        "Elemental Realms": "According to the World Axis cosmology, though most of the Elemental Chaos was an ever-changing landscape defined by chaos and unpredictability, there were planes within the Chaos that had a more defined set of stability. These sub-planes, called [[Divine realm|realms]], were formed through the will and power of mighty elemental beings, often primordials but including other denizens of the Chaos as well. Within these realms a sort of order was maintained, often reflecting the nature of its creator and ruler. This was not always entirely true and the Abyss, for instance, was as chaotic and dangerous, if not thoroughly more so, than the rest of the Chaos.\n\nLike [[dominion]]s, realms maintained laws and natures separate from the rest of the Chaos, though they dwelt within it, and often had strong connections with other planes outside of the Chaos.\n\n;[[Abyss|The Abyss]]\n:The home of demons, the Abyss was a deep, multilayered plane that lay at the \"bottom\" of the Chaos.\n;[[Cresting Spires]]\n:Dominated by the primordial [[Istishia]], the Cresting Spires were a plane dominated by water.\n;[[Fimbulwinter]]\n:Forged by the [[titan]] [[Thrym]], this plane was covered in ice.\n;[[Hidden Realm]]\n:The most powerful of the titans, [[Annam]], ruled this mysterious realm.\n;[[Muspelheim]]\n:Ruled over by the titan [[Surtr]], Muspelheim was dominated by a volcanic landscape.\n;[[Root Hold]]\n:Dominated by [[Grumbar]], the primordial lord of the [[Earth domain|earth element]], Root Hold was a series of vast subterranean halls with strong connections to [[Dismal Caverns|the Dismal Caverns]] and [[Dwarfhome]].\n;[[Sky Home]]\n:A realm ruled over by the primordial [[Akadi]] and dominated by rolling clouds and dark storms. Sky Home had links to the plane of [[Arvandor]].\n;[[Steading]]\n:This realm resembled a landscape of rolling hills and was dominated by the titan [[Grolantor]].\n;[[Thraotor]]\n:A plane of [[Storm domain|storms]], this plane was ruled over by the titan [[Memnor]].\n;[[Undying Pyre|The Undying Pyre]]\n:The Undying Pyre was a fiery plane of thick smoke and mighty flames, ruled over by the strongest of the primordial lords, [[Kossuth]].",
