        "mainbody": "There were rumors abound in the City of Dis that construction was going on just beyond the city borders, and reports claiming that nothing less than pit fiends were tasked with preventing witnesses and interference. None could tell from a distance what the massive structure was, but the same secretive sources claimed the baatezu were planning an unheard of undertaking to build a working, life-size model of Sigil. Allegedly this was to decipher how the Lady of Pain controlled her city, perhaps to tip the balance of the Blood War or attack Sigil, but construction could take eons to complete.\nThere was also rumors of a rogue pit fiend secretly marshalling forces to challenge Dispaters rule. Notably, the pit fiend Kriik was stripped of his station, if not form, for his undermining of Dispater some time before.\nLastly was the rumor that, should one manage to reach Dispaters throne room and breach his inner sanctum at the heart of the Iron City, inside was an even larger city, even farther from Dispater than before. The truth of such claims were unverified, for only his most trusted advisors could enter the room unbidden."
