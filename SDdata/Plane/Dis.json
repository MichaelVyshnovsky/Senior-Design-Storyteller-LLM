Allegedly this was to decipher how the [[Lady of Pain]] controlled her city, perhaps to tip the balance of the Blood War or attack Sigil, but construction could take eons to complete.\n\nThere was also rumors of a rogue pit fiend secretly marshalling forces to challenge Dispater's rule. Notably, the pit fiend Kri'ik was stripped of his station, if not form, for his undermining of Dispater some time before.\n\nLastly was the rumor that, should one manage to reach Dispater's throne room and breach his inner sanctum at the heart of the Iron City, inside was an even larger city, even farther from Dispater than before. The truth of such claims were unverified, for only his most trusted advisors could enter the room unbidden.",
        "Description": {
            "Geography": "Despite its seeming infinity, there was a plane of Dis distinct from the Iron City, as could be seen from within the metropolis by the presence of distant mountains. Despite the unnerving shifting of its boundaries, some claimed that one could leave the Iron City simply by walking far enough, upon which they would find the hinterland of Dis. The city was surrounded by a moat of poisonous water, perched upon an island in the middle of the lake. The stagnant streams of cold, black water that stretched threadlike across the landscape all came together at the lake, and some yet unmined [[turquoise]] could be found in the underwater crevices along their banks.\n\nThe vale in which Dis unevenly sat was otherwise a flat, barren plain with the occasional bare hill or tor rising up smoothly from the terrain. rose into low, rolling hills occupied by enigmatic pillars of moving stone. In the hills could be found a few veins of nearly pure [[copper]] (and smaller amounts of iron, [[tin]] and [[zinc]] ores) that the devils continued to mine and guard despite having a already almost exhausted them. Eventually one reached the exterior of the plane, the sheer, jagged and iron-rich mountains that ringed it. Iron roads spanned and wended through the maze of canyons wedged between the mountains, watched over by the garrisons of iron fortresses perched atop the peaks.\n\nYet even from outside the Iron City, the spatially anomalous nature of Dis was apparent. For one, the distance from one peak to another seemed unimaginable despite being part of the same range, and no matter how long and hard one travelled, even if teleportation was used, they would never reach the city or even find landmarks. The only way to progress was to follow a path at the base of the mountains which wound its way across the plain, although even this could take any amount of time. From the mountainside the path seemed to be white cobblestone, but up close was revealed to be half-buried skulls, crushed and cracked from the passage of those that came before.\n\nEventually the skulls gave way to tall spurs of blackened iron which rose from the ground like trees of blocky metal, increasing in number, height and thickness until they were akin to enormous walls or sheer cliffs (although the strange spatial principles made the transition point hard to identify). Entering always came as a break in reality,\n\nThe ever-overcast sky above Dis was a thick, dull, smoky-hued ash-green (or sometimes [[tomato]] red), but occasionally lit up by the flickering of high-reaching lightning, accompanied by faint thunder. Reports were inconsistent on whether there were dark, boiling storm clouds or no clouds at all,{{Cite organized play/LC/Ravens Bluff: Gateway to the Vast|10}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Into the Depths|24}} but a general dark haze over the entire layer regardless, caused by the pall of smoke from the burning iron of Dis, as well as visible wisps of odiferous vapors coming off the poisoned water. Fierce and unpredictable winds swept ceaseless over the plains, putting landbound creatures, especially those high on an exposed position, at risk of being sent flying through the air if they stood or moved against it, while only creatures that spent years maneuvering in the fickle winds could properly fly."

        "Cosmography": {
            "World Tree": "In the [[World Tree cosmology]] model, Tiamat's domain on the plane of [[Dragon Eyrie]] served much the same role in guarding Dis as her home in Avernus. Several soft borders linked the Eyrie to Avernus, including Tiamat's Fortress on Avernus, the cave mouth in the rock wall behind Avernus's Maggot Pit, and the depths of certain sinkholes scattered across Avernus, called the Mouths of [[Azharul]]. Access to Dis in this cosmology was restricted to a second soft border leading from the Eyrie back into the Nine Hells, protected by Tiamat's aspect.",
            "World Axis": "{{Fq\n| width  = 325px\n| source = The molten runes above the gate to Dis\n| text   = Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.\n}}\nIn the [[World Axis cosmology]] model, the Nine Hells were a planet-shaped [[astral dominion]] floating in the [[Astral Sea]], no longer of infinite size nor consisting of layers. In this cosmology Dis was a vast cavern over {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} across and easily {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} high illuminated by the ruddy glow of sluggish streams of lava and red-hot iron. Its floor was broken up by jagged mountains and sheer ravines,\n\nDis could be reached via many caves in Avernus, the most notorious route being a great archway with towering, open iron doors, the Gates of Malsperanze. From there it was a steep decline to the Iron City, following a {{SI|20|mi|k|long=yes}}, skull-littered road and bridges of iron spanning dizzying drops. Out from the lower gate of Dis was a descending road lined with gibbets which gradually broadened out into the layer of Minauros."

        "Notable Locations": {
            "Divine Realms": "God Street was not exactly a [[divine realm]] in and of itself, but an area where divine realms came to be. Located in the bleak, industrial outskirts of Dis, it was home to a variety of aspiring, new, and fading deities of lawful evil. When new figures of worship, such as mythical champions or revered objects, had a critical mass of lawful evil devotional energy attach to them, a new deity would be born. The entity's soul was retrieved from whatever state it was in, including imprisonment or outright conversion into an [[outsider]], or in cases where there was no relevant soul, such as if the being was fictional, simply coalesce into being. From there they would appear on God Street, usually in the small iron plaza bounded with faceless statues called the Borning Ring. The infinitely recursive space of Dis also made it popular for weak, realmless, pre-existing deities of lawful evil.\n\nUpon arrival on God Street, new deities quickly ripped holes in the malleable fabric of Dis's reality, to create singular, outlandish structures dedicated to their own glory. These included shrines, statues, temples, cathedrals, strongholds and even giant vortices or faces. Each seemed improbably immense from the outside, but the lesser deities of God Street could rarely create the illusion of infinity on the inside and so placed some form of visible boundary markers, making their realms appear as building interiors or tiny, bounded universes. Uncountable numbers of these creations stood alongside each other, running down God Street's winding, seemingly infinite, intersection-free length. Only [[divine]] casters could locate and get to the divine lane without aid from one of the deities (although chaotic and good-aligned casters struggled more), and if they so desired, find a particular deity's doorstep.\n\nNo matter how powerful a deity was on a single world, they were likely to scheme for future greatness on God Street until they attained followers on multiple. Known denizens included Khandovar the Punisher (a deity of torture), Z’zelth of the Eighth Order (a deity of false knowledge), and Uin the Unseeing (a deity of blind obedience). Besides God Street, the Fetters of the Iron City were crowded with shrines to dark deities and palaces that had long since fell into rotting disrepair. Temples included Tiamat's Fane of Glory, [[Bane#Bane vs. Bane|Bane]]'s Shrine of Swords, and [[Zehir]]'s House of Shadows. At the heart of Dis was the Hall of Infernal Might, a sprawling iron cathedral dedicated to Asmodeus, who many of the damned still worshiped.\n\n* Retreat of the Fallen, realm of [[Druaga]], [[Babylonian pantheon|Babylonian deity]] of [[summon]]ing baatezu. A vile palace sprawled across the entirety of his realm, a place of pillars and smoky hazes with vaulted ceilings barely visible from the ground. Any follower of the Babylonians who entered Baator had to do so through his realm, for as far as his pantheon's influence extended, he was the ruler of the fiendish lands, and permitted by the [[archdevil]]s to force baatezu into his service and determine what [[fiend]] to send over when a baatezu was called. The realm of the (perhaps self-titled) Ruler of the Devil World was far from the hills surrounding Dis's flat plain and tolerated without interference by Dispater."

        "Inhabitants": {
            "Devils": "[[File:FiresofDis.png|thumb|right|250px|An [[abishai]] in the Iron City.]]\nDis was a cruel but effective tyranny where every devil knew its place; his infernal attention made those beneath him cautious and watchful, and the only devils that survived long in the labyrinthine streets of his city shared unwavering suspicion and forward-thinking. The attention to detail this demanded left few openings in their defense and kept them alert to the myriad dangers lying in wait. Many creatures who so much as bargained with Dispater were driven to cloister themselves away, hiding in great fortresses behind clever traps and loyal servants, but they also knew the value of escape routes, and used what power he gave them to create paths that their enemies could not follow them down. At its most obvious, the influence of Dispater was seen in unsightly eyes growing all over a creature's body to watch for treachery and cover their flanks.\n\nMost kinds of devils could be found amidst the dark, crowded streets of Dis, but certain types were more commonly observed than others. They acted as slave labor in the [[petitioner]] work gangs, burning in pain from the hot iron the same as other petitioners. The lemures attempted to avoid their fellow baatezu, but the strong winds sent them tumbling helplessly through the air. \n\nThere were also a good many [[abishai]], [[imp]]s and [[spinagon]]s. Abishai perched and preened along the walls, keeping watch over the toiling petitioners within and without the Iron City, catching the fleeing condemned and angrily pummeling flying individuals who turned out not to be [[tanar'ri]] demons. [[Hellcat]]s roamed the hills and thronged the streets,{{Cite dragon/306/By Evil Bound|38}}\n\nInteresting among the devils common to Dis were erinyes. Dispater preferred to lead from the Iron Tower through erinyes, Erinyes could gain increased power and other rewards in Dis by currying more of his favor, as could be done by completing assignments well and diligently, or by completing the tests he often arranged for the loyalty he so desired.{{Cite organized play/LC/Into the Depths|26}}\n\nThe rolling hills beyond the Iron City were haunted by wild erinyes who seldom, if ever, went into the city. Native to the plane, they could navigate its winds with relative ease, sometimes remaining perpetually aloft to buffet lemures for sport or watch for intruders. Such watchers usually flew close to spotted intruders to note their numbers and appearance before heading straight to the city to inform Dispater or one of his commanders or guards. Along the way they would almost certainly encounter others of their kind to pass the message onto if not already in a band (in which case only one would leave), leading to several strikes by erinyes groups before an organized force arrived. Since Dispater, like all archdevils, always sought potentially useful creatures or items, the erinyes tried not to kill for fear or destroying something he might have wanted.\n\n[[Barbed devil]]s were uncommon in Dis, and [[bearded devil]]s rarer still, although both (and [[chain devil]]s) could be found in Mentiri as guards, (and in the case of the barbed devils specifically, as staffers alongside spined devils). In addition to bearded and spined devils, [[legion devil]]s and [[succubi]] dwelled in Dis in the thousands, [[Horned devil]]s and pit fiends were very rare, while [[styx devil]]s, [[ice devil]]s and [[bone devil]]s were almost absent (although the lattermost types both guarded and ran Mentiri).",
            "Petitioners and Planars": "{{quote\n|AAAGH! AAAGH!

            "Others": "Besides conspiring with devils, planar travelers came to Dis to close deals with various sorts of fiends, including [[night hag]]s, [[incubi]] and succubi. [[Stench kow]]s worked alongside spinagons as the working backbone of the estates of the dukes, which were wandered by [[achaierai]] and [[mephit]]s. Of particular note were the [[rakshasa]]s; they not only crowded the streets, sealing bargains within the city, but also wandered the noble holdings and were sometimes able to achieve important positions in a duke's court, although they were too independent and ambitious to be trusted or go unwatched. The city's population also had a significant number of [[cambion]]s. Besides the fiends, the city was filled with [[zombie]]s, and its fetid streets writhed with [[rot grub]]s and the occasional [[black pudding]]."

He rarely, if ever, leaves his tower, and when he does, it’s to descend into his city, Dis.\n}}\n\nAncient even by archdevil standards, Dispater's ageless rule over his self-named layer seemed to stretch back to the early days of the multiverse and the founding of Hell, with him being gifted it by Asmodeus.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|2}} Notably, he was not always the recluse of a lord he had become; rather it was after the [[Reckoning of Hell]], when the archdevils failed in a bid to unseat Asmodeus, that he refused to emerge from the Iron Citadel, shamed and weakened, but with his holdings intact.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|4}} This was seemingly the start of his decline into total paranoia, as reflected by Dis itself.\n\nFor example, while cruel and manipulative, Dispater recognized the need for goodwill with other planar beings, and while war-torn Avernus was too barren to support trade, Dispater often welcomed merchants to his city and had a booming marketplace as a result. After the death of [[Malagard]] the Hag Countess at the hands of Asmodeus's daughter [[Glasya]], seemingly with his collusion, his anxiety worsened, and he feared the half-crazed voluntary occupants were natural sources of betrayal. For fear of active provocation, he resolved to slowly squeeze them out by making Dis even more inhospitable through incremental harassment, heightened surveillance, and taxation. All the while the city became more compact and confining. \n\nFurthermore, the betrayal of Malagard saw Dispater retreat even deeper into his inner sanctum. He was convinced his ranks were filled with his traitors and had all his devilish subjects watching each other. He gave orders through multiple layers of intermediaries and personally met with only his most trusted advisors. Since then there has been little reason for Dispater to change course, especially with his fears being actively fostered and deepened by Titivilus. While gangs still fought in the Fetters, he kept control over them through his spies, and he collected a portion from every deal made in his layer through special provisions added to any contracts signed there.\n\nWith [[Zariel]] taking Avernus from Bel, Dispater's network of spies and secrecy had only grown. His informants were tasked with watching over anyone who might prove a threat to him, and many of his messages were written on the backs of imps wearing concealing vests that would kill them if any but the intended recipient tried to take them off. Dispater himself began dwelling in his tower's libraries, and had constructed an impenetrable suit of [[adamantine]] armor created with magical secrets to protect him in any environment. No longer did he manage the day-to-day of his layer, leaving that job to Titivilus, who himself often recruited and expended outsiders through various intermediaries to create and resolve conflicts.",
