'''Battle Garde''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Garagos]], a [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[demigod]] of war.

==Cosmography==
To those who subscribed to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Battle Garde was said to be originally located in the [[plane]] known as [[Limbo]]. But following defeat at the hands of [[Tempus]], Garagos's disposition changed and he no longer felt comfortable in Limbo, so moved his realm to the [[Cocytus|second layer]] of [[Pandemonium]].

According to the [[World Tree cosmology]], Garagos nomadically roamed the [[celestial plane]] of [[Warrior's Rest]] and declared whatever region he happened to be in as Battle Garde.
