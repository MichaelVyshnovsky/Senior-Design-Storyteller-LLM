The blocks of Thuldanin were hollow and pockmarked with pits that lead deep into the interior. There the flotsam and jetsam of the ages turned to stone in a matter of days or weeks because of the magic of this layer.",
        "Society": "Thuldanin had no inhabitants, except for the [[duergar]] living in Hammergrim. Other than this, there was only the occasional visitor from [[Avalas]] looking for some piece of [[magic]] or technology that might turn the tide of battle.",
