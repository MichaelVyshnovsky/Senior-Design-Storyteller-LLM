The Throne of Blood, also known as the Throne of Bhaal, was the divine realm of the god Bhaal.
The realm was described as feeling particularly alien.
During Bhaals reign as the Lord of Murder, the Throne of Blood rested on Khalas, the first level of Gehenna.

The Mana Forge was a device in Bhaals realm purposed with focusing his scattered essence in the years after his death. Each time one of his divine children died on Toril, a piece of his divinity returned within. 
It consisted of only a few circular platforms that, while floating freely in nothingness, still maintained normal gravity. Four smaller platforms encircled a larger central one, where energy was focused in a column of green light.
When Bhaal was slain during the Time of Troubles, in the , his realm was set adrift into the Astral Plane.
A decade later, a portion of his realm split away creating a plane-within-a-plane that was shaped by the will of his offspring Abdel Adrian.
During the War of the Bhaalspawn on Toril, nearly all of Bhaals divine children were slain and most of his divine essence returned to the Mana Forge in the Throne of Blood. Bhaals most trusted priestess, High Matriarch Amelyssan the Blackhearted was entrusted to safeguard his essence for the time of his resurrection. She betrayed her dead patron deity and amassed personal power in an attempt to seize the Throne for herself.
Amelyssan was challenged for control of the realm by Abdel Adrian, one of the last two remaining Bhaalspawn. After their battle the Mana Forge erupted in a massive explosion, leaving the realm and Bhaals essence hidden away for quite some time.
