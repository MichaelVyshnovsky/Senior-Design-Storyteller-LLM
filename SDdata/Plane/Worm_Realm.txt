The '''Worm Realm''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Urdlen]], the [[Gnome pantheon|gnomish deity]] of greed, destruction, and [[evil]] [[gnome]]s.

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], this realm was located in the [[Abyss]],{{Cite dragon/61/Gods of the Gnomes|33}} in its [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 399: Worm Realm|399{{th}} layer]] while in the [[World Tree cosmology]], this realm was said to take up the underground area of the fortress plane of [[Hammergrim]], but had a ''[[portal]]'' linking it to the Abyss.

==Description==
The Worm Realm consisted of an endless system of twisting tunnels dug out of layers of frequently collapsing [[clay]], earth, and stone that were rich in ore.

==Inhabitants==
Besides Urdlen himself, the twisting tunnels of his realm were inhabited by his [[petitioner]]s, [[purple worm]]s, [[umber hulk]]s, and the [[demon]]s known as [[hezrou]]s and [[mane]]s. Many of these creatures suffered from florid [[fungal]] and cancerous growths, that rotted them from within over a period of two to twelve months. Visitors to the realm who stayed for a long period of time would eventually contract this [[disease]] as well.

According to the World Tree view of Urdlen's realm, his petitioners were transformed into small, blind [[mole]]s with [[adamantine]] claws. They had no society and spent much of their time pursuing their own greedy ambitions.

==Rumors & Legends==
Among the members of the planar faction known as the [[Ring-givers]], it was speculated that the disease which afflicted inhabitants of the Worm Realm was due to a feud between Urdlen and the [[demon lord]] known as [[Zuggtmoy]], though there was no way to confirm this.
