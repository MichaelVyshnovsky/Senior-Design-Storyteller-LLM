        "Description": "Clangor was a plane of eternal battle. Armies of [[goblin]] and [[kobold]] petitioners clashed in struggle, only to be resurrected the following dawn to start the battle again, over and over.",
        "Inhabitants": "It was the home plane of the gods [[Hruggek]], [[Kurtulmak]], and [[Maglubiyet]].\n\n[[Hruggek]] resided in [[Hruggekolohk]], a warren of caves inhabited by small villages of [[hobgoblin]] petitioners, waging war with the tactics of ambush.\n\n[[Kurtulmak]] lived in another warren of caves, [[Draukari]]. The caves were narrow, short, muddy, and so twisted that it was very easy to get lost and get ambushed by an angry tribe of kobolds.\n\n[[Maglubiyet]] resided in a fort called [[Grashmog]], the Hearth of Battle. Grashmog served as a temple and training camp for [[clerics]] and [[warriors]]. The most feared ones were the [[Steelbiters]], respected for their bond with the fiendish [[winter wolf]] mounts."
