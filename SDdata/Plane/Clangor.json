        "mainbody": "Clangor was one of the realms of Avalas, the first layer of Acheron.\nClangor was a plane of eternal battle. Armies of goblin and kobold petitioners clashed in struggle, only to be resurrected the following dawn to start the battle again, over and over.\nIt was the home plane of the gods Hruggek, Kurtulmak, and Maglubiyet.\nHruggek resided in Hruggekolohk, a warren of caves inhabited by small villages of hobgoblin petitioners, waging war with the tactics of ambush.\nKurtulmak lived in another warren of caves, Draukari. The caves were narrow, short, muddy, and so twisted that it was very easy to get lost and get ambushed by an angry tribe of kobolds.\nMaglubiyet resided in a fort called Grashmog, the Hearth of Battle. Grashmog served as a temple and training camp for clerics and warriors. The most feared ones were the Steelbiters, respected for their bond with the fiendish winter wolf mounts."
