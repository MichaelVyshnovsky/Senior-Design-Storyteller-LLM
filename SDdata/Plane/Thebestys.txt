Thebestys, also known as Thoths Estate, was the divine realm of the Pharaonic and Mulhorandi deity of knowledge, Thoth.
Under the Great Wheel cosmology, this divine realm was located within the Outlands and had the River Maat pass through it. But in the World Tree cosmology, it was said to be part of Heliopolis and had the River Isis pass through it, the former of which was a plane shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Thoths Estate had a wide variety of terrain throughout it, though the World Trees conception of it was said to be marshy. In the areas where the River Maat passed through, it had deserts and swamps vying for dominance of the riverbank.
* The Great Wheel cosmology described this realm as having a number of villages and towns that dotted the banks of the River Maat, which were inhabited largely by the petitioners of Thoth.
* In the World Tree cosmology, there was likewise a city named Thebestys and several smaller villages.
* The Great Library, the hallowed halls where Thoth stored his accumulated knowledge, stood at the center of Thebestys. It was rumored that almost any answer one could want to search for was housed within the library, its vast collection rivaled only by the House of Knowledge. Thoth would gladly allow scholars to research within it, welcoming all who sought knowledge, but one would have to search through its immense collection of scrolls.
The petitioners that lived in this realm carried out mundane lives. In addition to the petitioners, one could find crocodiles and crocodile-like creatures in the River Maat.
