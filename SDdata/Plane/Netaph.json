        "Inhabitants": "Unlike petitioners elsewhere in the plane of Ysgard, those of Netaph did not wage war against one another. Instead they regularly traveled to and stormed the [[Abyss]], the [[Hades|Gray Waste of Hades]], and elsewhere in the [[Lower Planes]] to wage war upon the forces of [[evil]].\n\nThe only equipment and weapons these petitioners had was ancient, but it was quite durable and finely crafted. These included such things as [[chariot]]s. The [[spell]]s and weapons wielded by these petitioners were said to be unlike anything seen before by the [[fiend]]s they fought. And their arrival was almost always preced by thick flocks of birds of prey, so dense that they could darken the sky for miles in every direction."
