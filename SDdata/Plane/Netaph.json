        "mainbody": "Netaph was the divine realm of the Pharaonic and Mulhorandi deity of conflict and war, Anhur.\nUnder the Great Wheel cosmology, this divine realm was within the plane of Ysgard, on the layer of Asgard.Powers & Pantheons calls Anhur a \"Lesser Power of Arcadia\", where some other prominent Mulhorandi deities reside, but which does not fit his alignment. His domain is stated to be on the layer of Ysgard, suggesting he comes from the plane of Ysgard. This is confirmed by the sourcebook On Hallowed Ground. It encompassed an earthberg that was shared with Merratet, the divine realm of Bast,\nUnder the World Tree cosmology, Netaph was said to be part of Heliopolis, a neutral plane that was shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon. There it stood between a dry, barren desert and the fertile valley of Succor.\nWithin this realm a great deal of old forms of magic thrived, Many of these forms of magic were long since forgotten, lost to sages of the planes. In addition, all schools of magic were enhanced on Netaph.\nNetaph was a cool and temperate land, dotted with adobe and narrow canyons.\nThis realm was known for its birds of prey, which included domesticated eagles, falcons, and owls. These birds often flew in circles, awaiting a moment to strike.\n* In the World Tree conception of this realm, Anhur was said to live within a grand temple-palace at its very center.\nUnlike petitioners elsewhere in the plane of Ysgard, those of Netaph did not wage war against one another. Instead they regularly traveled to and stormed the Abyss, the Gray Waste of Hades, and elsewhere in the Lower Planes to wage war upon the forces of evil.\nThe only equipment and weapons these petitioners had was ancient, but it was quite durable and finely crafted. These included such things as chariots. The spells and weapons wielded by these petitioners were said to be unlike anything seen before by the fiends they fought. And their arrival was almost always preced by thick flocks of birds of prey, so dense that they could darken the sky for miles in every direction."
