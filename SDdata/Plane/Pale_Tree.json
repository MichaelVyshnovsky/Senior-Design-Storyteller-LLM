        "mainbody": "The Pale Tree was the divine realm of Solonor Thelandira, the elven god of archery, as he was always on the hunt.\nThe Pale Tree itself was a glorious white tree located in the midst of a deep green grove. It had silver leaves and roots of a mud-like gray color and grew far taller than any of the trees surrounding it. Ropes and platforms were seamlessly built among the branches of the white tree.\nBeyond the grove was a region of deep forests of redwood trees and rapid streams&mdashall of which Solonor held as his domain.\nThe realm was located in the greater realm of Arvandor, home of Seldarine, in the thickest part of Arvandors forests.\nLiving atop the platforms of the Pale Trees branches were the petitioners of Keen-Eye, along with others who chose to dwell there.\nThe elves believed that the white tree at the center of the grove had magical powers. Some claimed that they served as an aphrodisiac others believed that the leaves could cure ailments. In any case, the leaves were made into garlands or bouquets by those who could gain access to them."
