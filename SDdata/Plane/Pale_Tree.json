        "mainbody": "'''The Pale Tree''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Solonor Thelandira]], the [[elven]] god of archery, as he was always on the hunt.",
        "Description": "The Pale Tree itself was a glorious white tree located in the midst of a deep green grove. It had silver leaves and roots of a mud-like gray color and grew far taller than any of the trees surrounding it. Ropes and platforms were seamlessly built among the branches of the white tree.\n\nBeyond the grove was a region of deep forests of redwood trees and rapid streams&mdash;all of which Solonor held as his domain.",
        "Location": "The realm was located in the greater realm of [[Arvandor]], home of [[Seldarine]], in the thickest part of Arvandor's forests.",
        "Inhabitants": "Living atop the platforms of the Pale Tree's branches were the [[petitioner]]s of Keen-Eye, along with others who chose to dwell there.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The elves believed that the white tree at the center of the grove had magical powers. Some claimed that they served as an aphrodisiac; others believed that the leaves could cure ailments. In any case, the leaves were made into [[garland]]s or bouquets by those who could gain access to them."
