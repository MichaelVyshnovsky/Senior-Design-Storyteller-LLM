The other deities of magic, [[Azuth]], [[Savras]], and [[Velsharoon]], also made their homes on this plane not far from Mystra's domain.\n\nDweomerheart was destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion in the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], after [[Cyric]] assassinated Mystra causing the [[Spellplague]]. Though the deities of Dweomerheart largely perished, most of the faithful of Mystra, Azuth, and the other gods dwelling there were transported safely to the [[Fugue Plane]] where they were restored and re-assigned, many of them ending up either in [[Towers of Night]], [[Gates of the Moon]], or [[Kelemvor]]'s own [[City of Judgment]].{{Cite web|url=http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=702942&page=132|title=The one and only \"Ask the Realms authors/designers thread\" 3|accessmonthday=January 10th|accessyear=2009|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=May 16th, 2008}}",
        "Description": "This plane was mostly uninhabited mountain ranges, teeming with wildlife,<ref group=\"note\">This is based on the description of the previous home of Dweomerheart&mdash;the second layer of [[Elysium]] called Eronia. with no known ''portals'' to the other planes of existence. The only way to access this plane other than traveling through the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] was via branches of the [[World Tree]] itself, which connected to other Celestial planes.\n\nThe domains of the deities residing on this plane all occupied a single mountain with a flat top which was adorned with Mystra's shining city of magic, Dweomerheart. Dedicated to the appreciation and study of magic, especially to the creation of new magic, the city was the ultimate university for the [[Magic|Art]]. The city itself was the quintessence of [[alteration]], powered by [[conjuration]] through [[evocation]], all wrapped in [[illusion]]s that changed daily. It was a high honor to be asked to exercise one's creativity in casting the glamors and redecorating the city for a day.\n\nThe domains of Azuth, Savras, and Velsharoon were all sets of caverns and caves beneath the high plateau.",
        "Inhabitants": "Apart from the petitioners and the usual [[angels]] that served their deities, the only known inhabitants of this plane were the mysterious [[mercane]] looking for trading opportunities, and the [[inevitable]]s: lawful<ref group=\"note\">Even though [[Mystra (Midnight)]] was [[neutral good]], her predecessor [[Mystra]] was [[lawful neutral]] and may have been the creator of the inevitables. [[construct]]s created to enforce the fundamental laws of the multiverse.",
        "Realms": "* [[Azuth]], the High One, Patron of Mages, Lord of Spells, moved from [[Arcadia]] to this plane, according to the [[World Tree cosmology]] model. He took up residence in a warren of caves beneath the plateau holding the city of Dweomerheart. The eponymously named cavernous city was a club, classroom, and crucible for any who wanted to learn what it took to be a wizard.\n\n* [[Mystra]], the Lady of Mysteries and Mother of all Magic, made her realm the beautiful city of Dweomerheart and placed it on a high plateau on the very mountainous second layer (Eronia) of [[Elysium]], according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model.\n\n* [[Savras]], the Diviner, the All-Seeing, He of the Third Eye,{{Cite web enhancement/Deities|9}} located his demesne next to the city-caves of ''Azuth''. His caverns, known collectively as ''[[The Eye]]'', were not as grand as the High One's, but contained the god's myriad thoughts which echoed off the walls in a mental cacophony of past, present, and future knowledge. This realm was similar to [[Ilsensine]]'s ''[[Caverns of Thought]]'', but in The Eye, an oracle with a keen mind had a much better chance to glean useful information from the throng without risking madness.\n\n* [[Velsharoon]], Lord of the Forgotten Crypt, the Vaunted, the Archmage of Necromancy,{{Cite web enhancement/Deities|12}} had a realm called ''[[Death's Embrace]]'' deep below the domains of his fellow deities. As the center of [[necromancy]] for the entire multiverse, it had all the charm and grace of your typical crypt."
