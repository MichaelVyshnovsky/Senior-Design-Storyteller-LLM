Tir na Og was a large and beautiful realm in the Outlands. It was considered one of the largest shared realms in the Outer Planes. According to the Great Wheel cosmology, the realms of Silvanus and Oghma were located within its vast territory, as well as the realms of many other deities.
The realm was an expanse of meadows and oak groves that extended among hills and woods. The landscape was dotted with obelisks, cairns, and circles of standing stones, from which ancient magic often emanated.
There were no large cities in Tir na Og only villages and small settlements. The countryside also displayed single homes and farms.
The realms inhabitants fiercely defended their freedom and neutrality. If visitors were caught violating any of those principles, a strong measure of defense employed by some of the powers in the realm was to unleash the Wild Hunt upon the transgressors.
Several realms were located within Tir na Og, separated by between around 3 and 18 days travel from one to the next. Notable realms included
* The Deep Forest, realm of Silvanus.
* The House of Knowledge, realm of Oghma.
* The Pinnacle, realm of Dunatis.
Tir na Og was inhabited mainly by petitioners and former citizens of the Prime Material plane who sought a life of peace and quiet. Most of the realms inhabitants lived outside of its settlements, roaming the hills or living among the forests.
