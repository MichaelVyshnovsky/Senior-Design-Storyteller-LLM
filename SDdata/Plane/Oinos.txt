Oinos, also called the Battle Plain, was the first layer, also called first gloom, of Hades.
Oinoss landscape consisted mostly of plains with the occasional hill. It was the primary battleground of the Blood War, so it was where the fighting was the fiercest and most constant. Oinoss stunted trees and other plantlife was routinely destroyed by the fiendish armies trampling over it and the sounds of battle could be heard anywhere on Oinos.
Walking around on Oinos was dangerous for a person because of the risk of contracting a lethal disease called wasting sickness. It was believed that this sickness had to do with the many rotting corpses, which the aforementioned war produced.
The Styx ran only on this layer of Hades. The water generally ran slow. However, dangerous passages existed. Because it was the easiest place to embark or to land on the Styx, traffic was quite heavy. It was also the layer fiends who participated in the Blood War used to land. Ferry services by marraenoloths were commonly offered.
Another way to move between planes was to use portals, which were comparatively frequent on Oinos.
* The City of Strife, the location of the Crystal Spire, the shared divine realm of Kelemvor and Jergal after Cyric lost the portfolio of death, and around which stood the Wall of the Faithless, was located in Oinos according to the Great Wheel cosmology.
* Khin-Oin, the seat of power of the Oinoloth, supreme ruler of the yugoloth race and namesake of the plane.
Abbathor The dwarven god of greed lived in Glitterhell, one of the few places on Hades with color.
Cyric The Mad God lived once on Oinos in Bone Castle. He was still seen on Oinos after he moved to Pandemonium.
Kelemvor The god of the dead of Toril tried to be a good god but here it was always deemed a matter of time for him to fail. He transformed Cyrics realm in the Crystal Spire to serve as his abode.
Kuraulyek The god of the urds hid in his realm of Urdsrest among the hills of Oinos from Kurtulmak.
The Oinoloth The Oinoloth was the lord of Khin-Oin. The layer was named after him.
Yurtrus The orcish god of death maintained his realm of Fleshslough on Oinos.
