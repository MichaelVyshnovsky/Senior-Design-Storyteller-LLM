'''Hammergrim''' was the home plane of [[Laduguer]] and [[Deep Duerra]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]]. The evil [[Gnome|gnomish]] god [[Urdlen]] also burrowed its tunnels through the foundations of the plane.

==History==
In [[1383 DR]], [[Laduguer]], along with [[Deep Duerra]], was destroyed and Hammergrim dispersed into the [[Astral Plane]].
