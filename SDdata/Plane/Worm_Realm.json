        "mainbody": "he Worm Realm was the divine realm of Urdlen, the gnomish deity of greed, destruction, and evil gnomes.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, this realm was located in the Abyss, in its 399 layer while in the World Tree cosmology, this realm was said to take up the underground area of the fortress plane of Hammergrim, but had a portal linking it to the Abyss.\nThe Worm Realm consisted of an endless system of twisting tunnels dug out of layers of frequently collapsing clay, earth, and stone that were rich in ore.\nBesides Urdlen himself, the twisting tunnels of his realm were inhabited by his petitioners, purple worms, umber hulks, and the demons known as hezrous and manes. Many of these creatures suffered from florid fungal and cancerous growths, that rotted them from within over a period of two to twelve months. Visitors to the realm who stayed for a long period of time would eventually contract this disease as well.\nAccording to the World Tree view of Urdlens realm, his petitioners were transformed into small, blind moles with adamantine claws. They had no society and spent much of their time pursuing their own greedy ambitions.\nAmong the members of the planar faction known as the Ring-givers, it was speculated that the disease which afflicted inhabitants of the Worm Realm was due to a feud between Urdlen and the demon lord known as Zuggtmoy, though there was no way to confirm this."
