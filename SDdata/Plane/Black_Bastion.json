It was said to be so massive that it struck out any lingering light in the barrens skies.\nThe magnificent palace was constructed from the darkest metals and wood, like adamantine and ebony, and adorned with lustrous precious stones like jet and obsidian.\nBy the the Great Wheel cosmological model, the Black Bastion was said to reside in Avalas, the 1 layer of eternal battleground of Acheron.\nUnder the World Tree and World Axis models, it was situated in the Barrens of Doom and Despair,\nThe only recorded landmark of note within the Black Bastion was Banes personal throne of skulls.\nThe Black Bastion housed Banes personal army, which included devils and other extra-planar soldiers that heeded his call for war.\nIt was also home to the beasts of Bane, nocturnal monsters that were much more menacing than their mundane kin."
