The House of Knowledge was a celestial plane in the World Tree cosmology model In the Great Wheel cosmology it was the divine realm of Oghma on the Outlands. The realm had a strong connection to the magic of true names.
Oghmas library held an original copy of Gargauths journal from his time as emissary for the Lords of the Nine. Cyric perused this journal to find a spell that would let him see through all divine barriers and deceptions to aid in finding Kelemvors soul.
