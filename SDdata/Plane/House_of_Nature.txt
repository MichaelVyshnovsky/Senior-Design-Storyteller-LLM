The '''House of Nature''' was a [[World Tree cosmology#Neutral Planes|neutral plane]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]] model.

==Description==
While considered a neutral plane by sages,The primary natives of [[Elysium]], the [[guardinal]]s, and many of the divine realms of nature deities shifted from Elysium to the House of Nature when the cosmologies were changed between 2{{nd}} and 3{{rd}} edition.

A ''[[portal]]'' to the plane of [[Arvandor]] was maintained by cooperation of the deities residing here.

==Flora & Fauna==
In addition to all variety of [[animal]]s one might expect to find on a plane of nature, fiercer varieties, such as the [[fhorge]], were plentiful. Strange [[Wood element creature|creatures made entirely of plant and wood]] also inhabited the wilds of this plane.

==Inhabitants==
The House of Nature was the native home of the race of [[celestial]]s known as [[guardinal]]s, animalistic beings of inherent goodness. They focused on defending the House of Nature from the forces of evil.

[[Bariaur]]s and [[unicorn]]s also lived here, as did intelligent [[Celestial creature|celestial animals]] who were once natives of the [[Prime Material Plane|Material Plane]]. These [[petitioner]]s of the deities of the House of Nature began their lives here as [[humanoid]]s, but over time, they were changed slowly into animal forms.

[[Wemic]] petitioners of Nobanion were an exception; they maintained their wemic forms.

The petitioners lived in small communities, never building or changing their environment, but living in complete communion with the natural realm around them. If injured, they healed quickly, and they were immune to electricity and poison and resistant to fire and cold.

==Divine Realms==
Many deities and guardinal paragons had realms in the House of Nature. In addition to those described below, [[Animal Lords|animal lords]], such as the [[cat lord]], called the House of Nature Home. So did [[Syranita]], goddess of the [[aarakocra]], [[Skerrit]], god of [[centaur]]s, and other lesser-known deities of nature-oriented races. Gwaeron and Lurue dwelt in the House of Nature, but they did not maintain realms here.

The borders of the realms described below were fluid, with hard-to-distinguish boundaries.

===The Deep Forest===
{{Main|Deep Forest}}
Silvanus' realm was located in the deepest forest of the House of Nature, where the greatest trees grew so dense as to block out all light.

===The Great Mother's Garden===
{{Main|Great Mother's Garden}}
This was the realm of Chauntea. While she was considered a goddess of agriculture, her realm was not, in fact, cultivated. Instead, all manner of foods grew here naturally and in abundance.

===The Grove of the Unicorns===
{{Main|Grove of the Unicorns}}
This was a relatively simple tree grove, but it was frequently visited by unicorns, including [[celestial charger]]s. Mielikki maintained her realm here.

===The High Glade===
{{Main|High Glade}}
The High Glade, home to Shiallia, was found next to Mielikki's domain.

===The Labyrinth of Life===
{{Main|Labyrinth of Life}}
In the warmest region of the House of Nature was found this dense, vibrant, mazelike jungle. This was Ubtao's domain. Bursting up from the center of the jungle was a [[Forbidden Plateau (Labyrinth of Life)|plateau]], upon which all variety of [[dinosaur]]s roamed in isolation from other beasts.

===Morninglory===
{{Main|Morninglory}}
The realm of Lathander was a place of natural beauty infused with the colors of dawn and included a mountain lake and a meadow. Here stood a cathedral of tall timber that served as Lathander's home. Anyone resting in Morninglory felt fully refreshed in half the time as usual.

===The Pridelands===
{{Main|Pridelands}}
This region of the House of Nature was a vast savanna. Here, Nobanion ruled his wemic petitioners. The savannah was spotted with groves, one of which protected a ''portal'' to the [[Gulthmere Forest]] on the Material Plane.

===The True Grove===
{{Main|True Grove}}
Here, Eldath abode in a ring of tall oak trees with a bubbling spring in its center.
