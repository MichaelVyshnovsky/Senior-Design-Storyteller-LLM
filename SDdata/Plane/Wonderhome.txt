'''Wonderhome''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Gond]], the [[Faer没nian pantheon|Faer没nian]] god of craftsmen.

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Wonderhome was located in the [[Outlands]], though its exact placement within that [[plane]] was uncertain.<ref group="note" name="location">Wonderhome was never depicted on any maps of the Outlands, so its location in relation to all the other divine realms there is unknown. In the [[World Tree cosmology]], it was located in the [[celestial plane]] known as the [[House of Knowledge]], a plane that Gond shared with the Faer没nian deity of invention [[Oghma]]. And in the [[World Axis cosmology]], Wonderhome was also located within the House of Knowledge, but there the latter was considered to be an [[astral dominion]] belonging to Oghma.

A ''[[portal]]'' between this realm and the [[Mithral Forge]], divine realm of the [[gnome|gnomish]] craftsmen deity [[Flandal Steelskin]], was maintained by Gond.

==Description==
Wonderhome was said to be a great workshop full of all manner of inventions. Some were recognizable to [[Faer没n]]ians, though many more were not as they had yet to be discovered.
