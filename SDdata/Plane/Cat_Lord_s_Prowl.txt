The Cat Lords Prowl was the divine realm of the cat lord.
The Cat Lords Prowls location was not a static location, but rather defined as the area around the cat lords pride. One cat lord always picked out a misty copse near a water source somewhere within the Prowl as shelter for herself and the pride.
Where one cat lord preferred Brux, a number of them mainly roamed Krigala, or anywhere in the three layers of the Beastlands.
The cat lords pride consisted of all manner of cats, such as cheetahs, jaguars, spotted lions, mountain lions, tigers, smilodons, elven cats, leopards, and winged cats.
Besides the cat lord, the lesser deity of weretigers, Ferrix, also ran with the cat lords pride, usually in the form of a tigress. Her petitioners, in the form of weretigers and werejaguars, could in turn also be found in the Prowl.
