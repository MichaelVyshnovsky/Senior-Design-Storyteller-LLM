The '''Cat Lord's Prowl''' was the [[divine realm]] of the [[cat lord]].

==Description==
The Cat Lord's Prowl's location was not a static location, but rather defined as the area around the cat lord's pride. One cat lord always picked out a misty copse near a water source somewhere within the Prowl as shelter for herself and the pride.

==Location==
Where one cat lord preferred [[Brux]], a number of them mainly roamed [[Krigala]], or anywhere in the three layers of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].

==Inhabitants==
The cat lord's pride consisted of all manner of cats, such as [[cheetah]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[Lion#Spotted_lion|spotted lions]], [[mountain lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[smilodon]]s, [[elven cat]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[winged cat]]s.

Besides the cat lord, the [[lesser deity]] of [[weretiger]]s, [[Ferrix]], also ran with the cat lord's pride, usually in the form of a tigress. Her [[petitioner]]s, in the form of weretigers and [[werejaguar]]s, could in turn also be found in the Prowl.
