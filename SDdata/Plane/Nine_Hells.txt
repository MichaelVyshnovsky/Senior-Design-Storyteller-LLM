The '''Nine Hells of Baator''', sometimes shortened to '''Hell''' or '''Hells''', and named '''Baator''' ({{Pronounce|bay|AH|tor|refs=}}) in [[infernal language|Infernal]], was the home of the [[devil]]s and the plane that embodied [[lawful evil]]. It was a plane of sinister wickedness and institutional cruelty, its denizens organized into a strict caste system with a very rigid chain of command. Each of the nine Hells had its own physical laws or properties of matter, but all were inhospitable or deadly to outsiders. 

{{Quote
|From the boiling rivers of fluid in [[Avernus]] to the sheer crags of [[Nessus]], a body'd be hard-pressed to find a place that sums up the cold cruelty of the multiverse more than Baator does.

==Cosmology==
The [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model placed the Nine Hells in the [[Outer Planes]] between [[Gehenna]] and [[Acheron]], with additional connections to [[Concordant Opposition]] and the [[Astral Plane]]. Each Hell was a different infinite layer interconnected at ''barriers'' much like a nine-layered cake&mdash;the lowest points of one layer manifested barriers that exited high above the surface of the next lower layer.

When the Great Wheel model was overshadowed by the [[World Tree cosmology]] model, the river Styx was renamed the [[River of Blood]] and it flowed through all the [[fiendish planes]] (except for the [[Supreme Throne]] and the [[Demonweb Pits]]) originating in the [[Abyss]], passing through the [[Blood Rift]]&mdash;an unusual plane that connected the Abyss with the Nine Hells&mdash;bringing the devils even closer to their arch-enemies the [[demon]]s, resulting in the [[Blood War]]. The layers were still described as being infinite but with a central pit of finite size that opened to the next lower layer in a tiered fashion, with a drop of many miles between layers. The [[Astral plane]] connected all of the fiendish planes to the [[Prime Material Plane]], but not directly to each other.

| text   = The Hells are not so simple to understand. Boiling down nine cosmological layers into 'evil, but with a few more rules' does generations of scholars discredit. Each layer is its own unique moral and magical ecosystem. What [[Zariel]] permits in [[Avernus]] may be blasphemy to [[Mammon]] in the chained cities of [[Minauros]]. The Hells bend not only to their whim and will, but to their mere presence. The more souls they acquire, the more that combined influence spreads.
}}
After the [[Spellplague]], [[Asmodeus]] consumed the essence of the fallen [[Azuth]] achieving (some say regaining) [[Greater deity|greater godhood]] and ended the Blood War by casting the Abyss to the furthest depths of the [[Elemental Chaos]]. The [[World Axis cosmology]] model described the Nine Hells as an [[astral dominion]] floating in the [[Astral Sea]], no longer of infinite size nor consisting of layers,

==Geography==
{{/Imagemap}}
Each of the Nine Hells was unique and usually mirrored the malevolent characteristics of its ruler, or perhaps the archdevils were shaped by the domains they schemed to control, no one can be certain. In earlier cosmologies, each Hell was a separate infinite layer rigidly joined to its neighbors by barriers at fixed locations.The ''[[Player's Guide to Faer√ªn]]'' states on page 161 that "the nine layers of this plane are detailed in the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 3.5|Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' and ''[[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition|Manual of the Planes]]''" so information about the Nine Hells in those sources should be considered canon when not contradicted by a <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Forgotten Realms</span> source. After the Spellplague, the domains of the archdevils were described as territories (large, but finite)In other words, the following text merges information from different editions and settings and may originate from conflicting sources. The reader should proceed with caution, as with all things concerning devils.

===Trade===
Inhabitants of the Nine Hells produced goods exported across the planes, including to the planar City of Doors, [[Sigil]]. Green Baator ore and steel smelted from it was mined in Avernus. Another notable export was Baator's own [[whiskey]]. It was a pleasantly-smelling steaming-hot drink that resembled boiling [[goldflow]]. When consumed, it burned one's stomach with sweet pain. Very few mortals could stomach even a single shot.

===Avernus===
{{Main|Avernus}}
The first circle of Hell was also the "topmost" because Astral travelers would emerge from color pools on this layer and reaching the next circle required descending to the lower depths to breach a barrier to Dis.

[[File:FCII-Avernus-Anne Stokes-p37.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Avernus, the First Hell.'']]
By all accounts Avernus was a desolate wasteland with rocky terrain, sparse, twisted vegetation, concealed snake pits, caves and warrens, volcanoes, and rivers of magma. The sky was starless, full of choking smoke, and glowed a dark red due to balls of flammable gas that floated about or streaked across the atmosphere, randomly exploding as a ''[[fireball]]''.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|18}} During the Blood War, Avernus echoed with the marching of legions of devil troops preparing for the next campaign against the [[demon]]s of the [[Abyss]], the ground was littered with the detritus of countless battles, and blood trickled out of the ground in vein-like streams eventually flowing into the river Styx.

===Dis===
{{Main|Dis}}
[[File:FCII-Dis-Warren Mahy-p42.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Dis, the Second Hell.'']]
The second circle of Hell, when described as its own layer, was a flat barren plane containing little more than black, stagnant rivers, stretching for thousands of miles until it reached some rolling hills. The sky was a cloudy dull green shot through with lightning. In the center of this plane rose the Iron City of Dis, several miles in height and hundreds of miles wide.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|21}} The [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]] view of the Iron City was much the same but bigger, having been expanded by countless minions following [[Dispater]]'s grand plan. The walls of the buildings and the stones of the streets glowed the dull red of hot iron; more than brief skin contact resulted in severe burns. Prisoners of war, tormented underlings, criminals, and kidnap victims were kept in underground dungeons where their wails of woe could be heard filtering up through small vents in the iron walls. Above it all rose the [[Iron Tower]] where Dispater sat and schemed, untouchable. In the [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] view, the city of Dis was enclosed in a huge cavern accessible from Avernus through a tremendous iron gate in the side of a mountain.

===Minauros===
{{Main|Minauros}}
[[Image:Minauros.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Minauros, the Third Hell.'']]
Minauros as a layer was described as an endless bog of vile pollution, decaying bodies, and rotting marsh, repeatedly drenched by rain, sleet, and hail storms. The soggy, bone-strewn, disease-ridden swampland made movement very difficult and was only broken occasionally by serpentine ridges of volcanic rock.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|24}} Nameless creatures even the devils feared inhabited the swamp. Minauros as a realm was depicted as a broad but low-vaulted cavern connected to Dis. An oily water percolated through the roof of the cave and rained down upon swamps, deserts of mud and oozing black soil, pockmarked by bubbling fumaroles and mud geysers.

Minauros was also the name of the city built of black stone by [[Mammon]] on the treacherous surface of this place. Only the ceaseless efforts of thousands of minions and slaves prevent the city from sinking and being consumed by the bog.

===Phlegethos===
{{Main|Phlegethos}}
[[File:FCII-Phlegethos-Anne Stokes-p53.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Phlegethos, the Fourth Hell.'']]
The fourth circle was the Hell that most resembled the stereotype of a fiery world of eternal damnation, filled with active volcanoes, rivers of liquid fire, molten rock, ash hills, smoking pits, unbearable heat, all wracked by tremors and earthquakes.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|26}} Even the air seemed aflame and thus Phlegethos was considered to be [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|fire-dominant]]. In the [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] view, Phlegethos was a cavern several miles below Minauros, where burning lava poured out of fissures in the ceiling. The city of Abriymoch was the seat of power in this realm, built of hardened magma, [[obsidian]], and [[Rock crystal|crystal]] in the caldera of an extinct volcano which provided visitors some protection from the elemental environment found throughout the rest of the plane.

===Stygia===
{{Main|Stygia}}
[[File:FCII-Stygia-Carl Frank-p56.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Stygia, the Fifth Hell.'']]
The complete opposite of Phlegethos, Stygia was either a bottomless ocean covered by an ice sheet{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|30}} The great city of [[Tantlin]] was built upon one of these islands, in the curve of the swampy Styx, or perhaps on a giant ice floe. Due to the proximity of the Styx, Tantlin was a cross-planar trading post for those brave enough to attempt navigating the treacherous river.


===Malbolge===
{{Main|Malbolge}}
[[File:FCII-Malbolge-Tom Baxa-p61.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Malbolge, the Sixth Hell.'']]
There is significant disagreement between cosmologies on the nature of the sixth circle of Hell. As a Great Wheel layer, Malbolge was a gargantuan tumble of angular black stone blocks, each block ranging in size from a small city to a large metropolis, that formed a pile hundreds of miles thick. The randomly tilted and ill-fitting blocks were honeycombed with angular passages and caverns causing non-flying travelers to frequently need mountaineering skills and risk avalanches. Stinking clouds of vapor rose up from the depths and lit the sky with the color of blood, causing cosmologists to speculate that the blocks of Malbolge may have rested on an infinite sea of lava. Corroborating reports have been heard of flammable materials left on the ground spontaneously combusting.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|22}} Most habitations in Malbolge were copper-clad fortresses built from black stone.

The World Tree view of this layer was similar to the Great Wheel plane of [[Gehenna]]: a steep, infinite craggy incline often subject to avalanches that crushed most anything that got in the way. The copper-shod redoubts were teardrop-shaped or otherwise engineered to deflect tumbling boulders, but even those could not long withstand a direct hit from a major avalanche.

In the [[World Axis cosmology]] view, Malbolge was another huge cavern connected to Stygia by icy canals that ran hundreds of miles before reaching their destination. A former godly inhabitant had shaped the realm into a vast garden with fountains, towers, reflecting pools, and all manner of landscaping delights. With the coming of the devils, Malbolge was still beautiful on the surface but creeping corruption permeated the realm, twisting the beauty, perverting the architecture, and poisoning the pools.

===Maladomini===
{{Main|Maladomini}}
[[File:FCII-Maladomini-Eric Deschamps-p66.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Maladomini, the Seventh Hell.'']]
The [[Great Wheel cosmology]] view of the seventh circle of Hell described it as having vapor-polluted skies similar to Malbolge but the surface was solid.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|24}}

===Cania===
{{Main|Cania}}
[[File:FCII-Cania-Anne Stokes-p69.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Cania, the Eighth Hell.'']]
Both pre- and post-Spellplague cosmologies agree that Cania<ref group="note">The ''[[Manual of the Planes 1st edition]]'' (page 109) and ''[[Dragon_(magazine)|Dragon #76]]'' (page 26) spelled the name of the eighth layer "Caina" but ''[[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition]]'' (page 122) and ''[[Monster Manual 4th edition]]'' (page 61) corrected it to "Cania". was a bitterly [[Planar traits#Elemental and Energy Traits|cold-dominant]]{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|28}} but later reports say the Lord of the Eighth's fortress/palace was made of ice. All accounts seemed to agree the tower had a heated, luxurious interior and sat atop a gargantuan glacier called Nargus whose speed and movement were under the control of [[Mephistopheles]] himself.

===Nessus===
{{Main|Nessus}}
[[File:Nessus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Nessus, the Ninth Hell.'']]
The ninth and deepest Hell was a land of extremes in the [[Great Wheel]] view: regions cold as Cania, volcanoes like Phlegethos, a lake of ice, a flaming forest, sheer cliffs, ''firewinds'',{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|32-34}} and a citadel even larger than [[Khin-Oin]] in [[Hades]]). The [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]] view did not contradict this description of Nessus but focused more on the blasted and torn landscape out of which rose Malsheem, the Citadel of Hell. It was said that Malsheem could hold millions of devils within its mountainous edifice, from the lowest warrens deep in the trench to the soaring spires miles above the tortured plane. The [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] model agreed that a progression of rifts, pits, and chasms lead down and down, forming a vertical maze hundreds of miles deep that contained great cities, fiendish armies, and the mighty fortress of the Overlord [[Asmodeus]].

==Inhabitants==
{{main|Devil}}
The principal inhabitants of the Nine Hells/Baator were the [[devil]]s, and their offspring in varieties too numerous to catalog here. See the main article for descriptions of the myriad devilkind. Unlike the [[demon]]s of the [[Abyss]], the devils were highly organized in their quest for power and status&mdash;scheming and plotting power plays, coups, and assassinations. 

In addition to the devils, this plane was home to [[bonespear]]s, [[gathra]], [[haraknin]], [[hell hound]]s, [[imp]]s, [[night hag]]s, [[nightmare]]s, and [[maelephant]]s.

==Afterlife==
{{Main|Afterlife}}
Beliefs about the journey of souls to the afterlife changed with the shifting [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and the [[crystal sphere]] in which one resided. In some worlds, [[lawful evil]] souls were automatically destined for the Hells and arrived as mindless [[nupperibo]]s or, if they were worthy, as semi-intelligent [[lemure]]s. For mortals of [[Realmspace]], however, souls first traveled to the [[Fugue Plane]] where they awaited escort to their final rest on the plane of their primary deity. While waiting, devils were allowed to bargain with the souls, playing on their fears and doubts to get them to agree that becoming a lemure with a chance for promotion was a better option than their suspected fate. Strong or crafty souls might negotiate a deal that reduced their time as a lemure or bestow a boon or punishment on those they left behind. After the [[Spellplague]], [[Shar]] reshaped the [[Plane of Shadow]] and folded in what death energy did not get absorbed into the [[Elemental Chaos]] and created the [[Shadowfell]]. According to the [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] view, souls on their way to the afterlife started their journey in the Shadowfell. Most made it to the Fugue Plane to await judgment, but a few remained behind or were lost.

==Realms==
[[File:The Abyss.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''Asmodeus and his armies attacking demons in the Blood War.'']]
The nine circles of Hell were each ruled by an [[archdevil]] of great power, but the Nine Hells were also the home of other powerful beings at various points in the history of the Realms. Listed here in alphabetical order are those that directly or indirectly influenced the course of events in [[Faer√ªn]], [[Toril]], and beyond.
* [[Asmodeus]], the Overlord of the Nine Hells, exercised his power from a gargantuan citadel in the lowest rift of Nessus, named ''Malsheem''.
* [[Azharul]]'s [[Dragonspawn Pits]] were located in Avernus.
* [[Baalzebul]] ruled the seventh circle of Hell, through his viceroy [[Moloch]].
* [[Bahgtru]], the strong but dim-witted son of [[Gruumsh]], once resided in the Nine Hells before moving to the [[astral dominion]] of [[Nishrek]] as described by the [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]] and [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] cosmology models.
* [[Belial]] was the ruler of Phlegethos, the fourth circle of Hell, based in the basalt palace ''Abriymoch'' the "Mount of Leaping Flames", nestled in the caldera of an extinct volcano. Sometime before the [[Spellplague]] he set his daughter [[Fierna]] up as the ostensible ruler while he directed from the wings.
* [[Dispater]] dominated the second circle of Hell, Dis, from his high stone (later iron) tower in the city of the same name, also called the ''Iron City''.
* [[Fierna]], daughter of [[Belial]], was the archduchess of the fourth circle, fiery Phlegethos, as much as her father allowed.
* [[Gargauth]] was thought to have been an [[archdevil]] cast out of the Hells long ago for betrayal. He eventually achieved godhood corrupting souls on the [[Prime Material Plane]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deities|6}}
* [[Geryon]] once ruled Stygia, the fifth circle of Hell, from a castle/city called ''Tantlin''. At some point he was replaced or deposed by [[Levistus]] before that archdevil was imprisoned in the ice.
* [[Glasya]], daughter of [[Asmodeus]] and former consort of [[Mammon]] was the ruler of the sixth circle, Malbolge, after her father removed the [[Hag Countess]].
* [[Gruumsh]], god of slaughter, chief god of the [[orc]]s, once had a realm in the Nine Hells and other [[Lower planes]] (see [[Acheron]]) before relocating his family to the ''Iron Fortress'' in the [[astral dominion]] of [[Nishrek]].
* The [[Hag Countess]] held sway over Malbolge, the sixth Hell, after giving unwise council to [[Moloch]] causing him to rebel against [[Asmodeus]] and be defeated. Asmodeus eventually got rid of her and installed his daughter [[Glasya]] as Lord of the Sixth.
* [[Hecate]], the [[Greek pantheon|Greek]] interloper deity of magic and the moon, had her second realm, named [[Aeaea]], in Minauros.<ref><ref group="note" name="note1">''[[Tales of the Outer Planes]]'' identifies Hecate's divine realm as residing on [[Phlegethos]], the fourth layer of the Nine Hells, but the later books ''[[Guide to Hell]]'' and ''[[Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells]]'' change its location as being in the third layer, [[Minauros]].
* [[Ilneval]], master of strategy and chief lieutenant to [[Gruumsh]], once lived in the Nine Hells before moving to [[Nishrek]] as described by the [[World Tree cosmology]] model.
* [[Inanna]], an [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric]] goddess of love and war, once had a realm in the fourth circle, Phlegethos.
* [[Kurtulmak]], god of the [[kobold]]s, once lived in the caverns of Avernus named [[Draukari]] where he maintained the appearance of friend and ally to whichever archduke was trying to lure him to their faction at the time.<ref> He eventually moved his realm to [[Clangor]], according to the [[World Tree cosmology]] model, but maintained a portal to the Nine Hells.
* [[Levistus]] was the ruler of Stygia before (and perhaps even while) he was imprisoned in an iceberg floating on the frozen sea.
* [[Luthic]], mate of [[Gruumsh]] and [[orc]]ish goddess of caverns, female orc fertility, and primitive medicine, shared a realm with Gruumsh in the Nine Hells before moving with him and her son to [[Nishrek]].
* [[Maglubiyet]] the Mighty One, Lord of Depths and Darkness, once had a realm in the Nine Hells as well as other [[Lower planes]] as part of his wandering (see [[Acheron]]). Later, he moved his realm to [[Clangor]], but he maintained a portal to the Nine Hells.
* [[Mammon]] once ruled Minauros, the swampy third circle of Hell, in a city of the same name built on many huge pillars of black stone that were constantly sinking slowly into the sludge.
* [[Mephistopheles]] presided over the frigid eighth circle of hell, Cania, from his mighty citadel ''Mephistar'', overlooking the Nargus glacier.
* [[Moloch]] ruled the sixth circle of Hell, Malbolge, as the viceroy of [[Baalzebul]] before it was taken over by the [[Hag Countess]] and later [[Glasya]].
* [[Sekolah]], the god of the [[sahuagin]], once swam in the deep waters beneath the ice of Stygia in a realm called ''[[Sheyruushk]].''
* [[Set]], the jackal-headed [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] Lord of Evil, once controlled a huge realm in Avernus that he turned into a desert under a blazing sun.
* [[Tiamat]] once ruled the first circle of Hell, Avernus, from her cavernous lair ''[[Azharul]]'', "[[Tiamat's Lair|The Dragonspawn Pits]]", After the [[Spellplague]] she became a servant of [[Bane]] in [[Banehold]].
