The '''Cavern of Rest''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Marthammor Duin]]. It was located in [[Nidavellir]], the subterranean third layer of [[Ysgard]] according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], and in [[Dwarfhome]] according to the [[World Tree cosmology]].

==Cosmography==
From the Great Wheel perspective, the Cavern of Rest was located among the ever-shifting tunnels of Nidavellir.

In the World Tree, the Cavern was located in a remote part of Dwarfhome's foothills. Despite its secluded location, other deities' domains could be accessed from there.

==Inhabitants==
The Cavern was inhabited and guarded by [[dwarf]] [[petitioner]]s who in life had traveled to the surface of the world and had died above ground. The realm was also guarded by [[boar]]s and [[war dog]]s trained by Marthammor Duin.

Marthammor himself did not spend much time in his realm, but instead traveled in [[north Faer√ªn]] in his [[avatar]] form.
