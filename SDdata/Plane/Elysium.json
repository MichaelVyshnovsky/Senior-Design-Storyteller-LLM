''[[Divination]]'' spells were required to determine the destination of these portals with certainty. Navigating the river [[Oceanus]] downstream also led to the Happy Hunting Grounds but any underground passages were not likely to be safe for boats. Amoria best fit the description given above and the river Oceanus had many side channels that split and merged back again, creating many \"banks\" for the establishment of realms.",

            "Thalasia": "{{Main|Thalasia}}\nThe fourth and \"outermost\" layer of Elysium was a great ocean, sometimes called the Thalasian sea, that was both the source and final destination of the River [[Oceanus]].
