        "mainbody": "Azuth was the  divine realm of Azuth, the god of Wizards.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, Azuth lay on the layer of Buxenus in the plane of Arcadia. It was an expansive cavern that could only be accessed by entering through the side of a hill in Buxenus. This was protected by a glamor only those with a wizardly bent could see through, although they could guide others through it as well. This entrance led to a winding staircase which led further down until the whole cavern became visible.\nApart from Azuth, Mystras failsafe ‘echoes’ resided here as well, within a royal castle and surrounded by blue mists."
