Zigguraxus was the home plane of the Untheric pantheon,
From the viewpoint of the Great Wheel cosmology, Zigguraxus was solely the divine realm of Gilgeam. It was located on Avalas, the first layer of the Outer Plane of Acheron.
When the pantheon was dissolved in 1358 DR after the deaths of Gilgeam and Ramman, the plane disappeared from Torils cosmology.
In 1487 DR, the returned god Enlil rebuilt the plane for some purpose.
