Indra was a region of Limbo considered by some to be its fourth layer. It was named after the deity Indra of the Lords of Creation, whose divine realm was believed to be primarily located there.
The layer of Indra was indistinguishable from any other location in Limbo. It was a churning storm of ever-changing matter and energy, with the occasional ephemeral fragments of stable landscape. The raw chaos could in principle be manipulated and stabilized by a creatures force of will.
There were barriers separating Indra from the other layers of Limbo, but they were considerably weaker than similar barriers between layers in other planes, so that it was possible to find realms and permanent settlements typically associated with other locations of Limbo there. Those barriers were also constantly shifting their position, sometimes allowing portions of a neighboring layer to bleed through, increasing or decreasing the layers size.
In fact, many scholars simply disregarded the reason for the barriers existence, considering the entire plane one single layer.
Indras palace in the shared divine realm of Swarga was located primarily on this layer, although it constantly moved and frequently shifted between layers. It was a great marble sphere decorated with carvings of Indra, surrounded by constant rain. The interior of the sphere was filled halfway with milk. At the center of this enchanted sea, a turtle-shaped island floated, atop which Indras palace stood.
Indras realm was populated by numerous petitioners and einheriar servants.
The region of the layer pertaining to Swarga was generally avoided by the githzerai anarchs, since shaping the realm to a mortals will risked attracting the wrath of the destructive deities.
