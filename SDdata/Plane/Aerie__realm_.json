        "mainbody": "The Aerie was the divine realm of the elven goddess of air, weather and avians, Aerdrie Faenya, which she shared with Syranita, goddess of the aarakocra. Among the latter the place was known as Whistledge.Aerdrie Faenyas realm was not named in 2nd-edition sources. Syranita, said to share the domain of the elven goddess, had a realm called Whistledge. In 3rd edition, Aerdries realm was called the Aerie. This article assumes that all three places are the same.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, the Aerie could shift according to their deities whims between the joint realm of the Seldarine in Arvandor and the homestead of more chaotic-minded elven petitioners, Alfheim. The former was part of Arboreas first layer (also called Arvandor) the latter lay in Ysgards first layer (also named Ysgard).\nIn the World Tree cosmology, the realm was located within the plane of Arvandor.\nIn either case, it floated above the breathtaking landscapes inhabited by the earth-bound petitioners.\nThe Aerie consisted of cloudy islands covered with double-topped trees and crowned by a bright aerial palace. It could be approached by means of flight, but even that was often difficult due to prevailing strong winds."
