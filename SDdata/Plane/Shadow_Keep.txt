}}'''Shadow Keep''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Mask]].Mask's successor had a realm in the [[Shadowfell]] but it's not clear whether it's the Shadow Keep. This article's Mask is meant to be the pre-[[Spellplague]] one.

==Location==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Shadow Keep was on [[Niflheim]] in [[Hades]].

In the [[World Tree cosmology]], Shadow Keep was found on the [[Plane of Shadow]].

==Features==
Shadow Keep was a castle. It was surrounded by fog and shadow and therefore was hard to see and confusing for would-be onlookers. The one thing that would make it stand out clearly was the casting of a ''[[daylight]]'' spell.
