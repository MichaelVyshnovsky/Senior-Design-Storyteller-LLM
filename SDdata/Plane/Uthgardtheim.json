        "mainbody": "Uthgardtheim was the divine realm of Uthgar. It was located on the first layer of Ysgard according to the Great Wheel cosmology, and in Warriors Rest according to the World Tree cosmology.\nThe realm was cold, but not inhospitable. The climate was similar to the North during winter.\nAccording to the World Tree cosmology, the realm of Uthgardtheim was located in the colder reaches of Warriors Rest.\nThe petitioners of Uthgardtheim enjoyed hunting and feasting in Uthgars halls. The god himself shared the realms pleasures with his fellow warriors."
