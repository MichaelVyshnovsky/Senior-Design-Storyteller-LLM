        "mainbody": "'''Tir na Og''' was a large and beautiful realm in the [[Outlands]]. It was considered one of the largest shared realms in the [[Outer Planes]]. According to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the realms of [[Silvanus]] and [[Oghma]] were located within its vast territory, as well as the realms of many other [[deity|deities]].",
        "Geography": "The realm was an expanse of meadows and [[oak]] groves that extended among hills and woods. The landscape was dotted with obelisks, cairns, and circles of standing stones, from which ancient [[magic]] often emanated.\n\nThere were no large cities in Tir na Og; only villages and small settlements. The countryside also displayed single homes and farms.",
        "Defenses": "The realm's inhabitants fiercely defended their freedom and neutrality. If visitors were caught violating any of those principles, a strong measure of defense employed by some of the powers in the realm was to unleash the [[Wild Hunt]] upon the transgressors.",
        "Notable Locations": "Several realms were located within Tir na Og, separated by between around 3 and 18 days' travel from one to the next. Notable realms included:\n* The [[Deep Forest]], realm of [[Silvanus]].\n* The [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]], realm of [[Oghma]].\n* The [[Pinnacle]], realm of [[Dunatis]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Tir na Og was inhabited mainly by [[petitioner]]s and former citizens of the [[Prime Material plane]] who sought a life of peace and quiet. Most of the realm's inhabitants lived outside of its settlements, roaming the hills or living among the forests."
