'''Offalmound''', sometimes named interchangeably with the name of its [[Abyss]]al layerâ€“'''Rarandreth''', was the 223{{rd}} layer of the [[Abyss]],

==History==
Many scholars argued that after the perceived death of its ancient master Moander in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the layer ceased to exist. Another school of thought on the matter was that along with the deity's body, their realm was ejected beyond the [[Astral Plane]], where it floated adrift. These theories seem to have been false or Moander's demise was not as complete as many thought. As of the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], Offalmound remained a layer of the Abyss, with its lordship contested.
