        "mainbody": "The Caverns of Thought were the divine realm of Ilsensine, the illithid god of magic.\nAccording to the Great Wheel cosmology, the Caverns of Thought were located deep underground beneath the Outlands and were connected to the realm of the beholder deity Gzemnid. The World Tree cosmology established the realm as part of the fiendish plane of the Deep Caverns.\nIn both cosmologies, however, the Caverns of Thought were described as a hostile place wrought with inaudible yet clear and powerful thoughts that slowly drove its visitors mad until they were reduced to thoughtless zombies.\nThe realm was a labyrinth of tunnels that were lit by the faint glow of fungus. It was avoided even by fiends. The dwarf inhabitants of the nearby realm of the Dwarven Mountain also avoided digging their tunnels too close to the Caverns.\nThe only creatures that dared visit the realm were motivated by the search for knowledge that Ilsensine possessed. However, the price he demanded was high, often leading to the visitors losing part of their own minds."
