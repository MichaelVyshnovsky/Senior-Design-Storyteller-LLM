'''Amun-thys''' was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic]] and [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity|goddess]] of wealth, [[Nephthys]].

==Cosmography==
Under the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Amun-thys was located in the [[plane]] of [[Arborea]], on the layer of [[Pelion]] and was the sole divine realm that stood in that layer. While in the [[World Tree cosmology]], it was said to be part of [[Heliopolis]], a [[Neutral Planes|neutral plane]] shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.

==Geography==
In its entirety, the terrain of this realm was a desert with many dunes and the scattered, giant carcasses belonging to [[lesser titan]]s from [[Olympus]], who fell on the way to Bal-tiref, which for unknown reasons they traveled to when it was their time to die. Some of their corpses had been hollowed out, tanned, and reinforced to transform them into shelters. While others had been used as foundations and had necropoli built atop of them.
===Flora & Fauna===
Like the rest of Pelion, very few animals or plants could be found across this realm. The most creatures one could encounter included [[adder]]s, [[buzzard]]s, desert [[rat]]s,  small [[lizard]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[snake]]s, and [[vulture]]s.

All plants in this realm were brittle, desiccated, and as white as the desert sands themselves. They were typically found near mud pools or where water laid close to the surface. Some of the plants one could find included dust reeds, tumbling lilies, and white lotuses.
===Planar Conditions===
Any [[spell]] that was related to the dead, dreaming, or sleeping was more powerful when cast within this world. The effect of the ''[[fool's gold]]'' spell were permanent when cast here. And a greater number of creatures were affected than usual by ''[[commune]]'', ''[[commune with nature]]'', ''[[shadow walk]]'', ''[[sleep veil]]'', ''[[speak with dead]]'', ''[[weird]]'', and [[potion of dreaming|''potions of dreaming'']].

Additionally, while in this realm the perceptions an individual were warped in that they viewed things as being more valuable than they actually were.

==Notable Locations==
* Scattered throughout this desert land were a number of crypts, mausoleums, necropoli, tombs, and temples, tombs, meeting places, monuments, and crematoria. A large number of these structures were thoroughly plundered, but many still remained untouched. Potentially they were once pat of great cities or enormous burial sites. But those that weren't contained the hoarded wealth of Nephthys, grave goods that had belonged in life to the wealthy.
* '''Bal-tiref''', an enormous echoing necropoli that was home to [[ghast]]s, [[jackal]]s, [[rat]]s, and other scavengers. It was considered to be the great necropolis in all of the realm, more profitable than other tombs.
* '''The mortuarties'''. These were renowned for their skills in cremation, mummification, preservation of grave goods, and taxidermy. The morticians that worked at them were known to [[phylacteries]], magical [[scarab]]s, and ''[[oil of timelessness]]''.
* '''Nefankh Quarry''', a site where sculptuors and stonemasons worked stones like [[alabaster]], [[basalt]], and [[granite]] for the purpose of mausoleum walls and monuments. Though some stones were polished and refined into temple idols or victory obelisks.
* '''Palace of Nephythys'''. Located in the center of this desert plane, it was made of dun-colored stone.
* '''Scarab''', a small city near the palace. It consisted of white mud hovels

==Notable Inhabitants==
* '''Argevar''', an illusive [[brass dragon]] who enjoyed shapeshifting into a [[human]] and was rumored to have a mountainous treasure horde hidden in the Realms. Some local priests of Nephthys even believed these rumors and sought the horde as tribute to the goddess.
* '''Isaratet the White Ibis''', high priestess of Nephthys and ruler of Scarab. She was one of the few friendly individuals in the realm, but demanded an oath of honesty and peace before allowing anyone into her settlement. Anyone that broke such an oath was soon afterwards afflicted with [[mummy rot]].
* '''Manhayth''', an [[aasimar]] who roamed the land hunting the [[lycanthrope]]s that inhabited it.
* '''Osirem the Cruel''', an arrogant and powerful [[werebat]] who was one of the best known bandits of the realm.
* '''Tyun Amerinvai''', a member of the [[Dustmen]] who worked at Bal-tiref and was wise to much of the local gossip.

==Inhabitants==
The [[petitioner]]s of this realm were few in number. or scarlet. Known as Amunian robes, Amun-thys was well known for them and they were sought after by members of the [[Society of Sensation]].

Going to great lengths to protect the realm's various crypts from looters, both Nephthys and her the petitioners greatly discouraged visitors and travelers. For the petitioners, this unwelcoming nature was brought about from having been betrayed by bandits countless times in the past, as typically the realm was avoided by all but the greediest of planar travelers.

In addition to the petitioners, there lived roaming bandit tribes of werebats, [[werehyena]]s, [[werelion]]s, and even enormous [[werevulture]]s. Minions of the Pharaonic deity [[Set]] were also only occasionally seen.

==Rumors & Legends==
* Among members of the Dustmen there were rumors that the morticians of this realm could be paid to transform one into a [[mummy]].
* Tribes of [[w:c:darksun:Elf|elves]] from the desert world of [[Athas]] were rumored and allegedly sighted by some living in this realm.
* Some of the petitioners of this realm claimed to have seen a [[phoenix]] nesting within the sands and that its nest erupted into a pillar of flame each night. More avid peddlers of rumor claimed that its egg was an exquisite [[jewel]], that shined like a beacon during the day.
* Many of the tombs in this place were believed to belong to dead deities.
* The Ditch, the only large body of water in [[Sigil]], was rumored to contain a [[portal]] to this realm.<ref>
