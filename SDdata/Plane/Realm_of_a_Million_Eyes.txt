The '''Realm of a Million Eyes''' was the 6{{th}} [[Layers of the Abyss|layer]] of the [[Abyss]] according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] cosmologies. It was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Great Mother]], chief [[deity]] of the [[beholder]] pantheon.

==Geography==
Although difficult to distinguish from other similar realms in the Dismal Caverns, the Realm of a Million Eyes was a predominantly vertical system of caverns and tunnels. The walls themselves had protruding eyes, which belonged to the Great Mother herself.

===Geographical Features===
The Great Mother's lair lay in a large cavern at the bottom of the tunnel system, from which she endlessly spawned new beholders into existence.

==Inhabitants==
The realm was inhabited by every type of beholder and [[beholderkin]] that existed. They constantly attacked each other on sight, as well as any visitors, including [[demon]]s. Some of the oldest and most powerful beholder [[petitioner]]s of the realm acted as its police force.
