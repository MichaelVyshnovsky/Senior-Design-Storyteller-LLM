        "Inhabitants": "Many woodland creatures roamed the mountains, hills, forests, and fields of Arcadia. They resembled Prime Material creatures except for their coloring, which was metallic like the trees, and their eyes, which were white without iris or pupil. Examples included copper colored rabbits, golden foxes, and sheep with silver wool. Organized, hive-dwelling insects such as ants, bees, and wasps were also found in this plane. None of the animals could speak but all were peaceful in nature and native to the [[Outer Planes]] so they were unaffected by magics that usually worked on Prime Material creatures. In addition, their eyes allowed them to see through any [[illusion]] and the more intelligent animals could be trained into superb watch beasts.\n\nThe primary inhabitants of Arcadia were the spirit legions formed from the souls of good and lawful warriors, much like their evil counterparts in [[Acheron]]. Other sentient creatures that dwelled in Arcadia included [[hollyphant]]s, [[planetar]]s, [[foo creature]]s and the occasional [[deva]]. It was not uncommon to see creatures from neighboring planes visiting: [[shedu]], greater and lesser [[lammasu]], and [[ki-rin]] for example.",
