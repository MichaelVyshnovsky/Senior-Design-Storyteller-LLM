        "mainbody": "Fennimar was a forest realm in the plane of Limbo according to the Great Wheel cosmology. It was the divine realm of Fenmarel Mestarine.\nThe realm was a stretch of forest surrounded by a perilous mountain range that was nearly impossible to traverse. This arrangement kept unwelcome visitors such as slaadi at bay. The forest itself had numerous glades, valleys and streams, inhabited by the same sort of sylvan creatures that could be found in Arvandor.\nThe weather was extremely chaotic and unpredictable in the realm, a reflection of the plane in which it was located. Conditions changed rapidly and wildly without warning.\nThe only artificial structures in the realm were numerous waystations designed to aid travelers in need. Although mostly uninhabited, these locations were always kept supplied with clothes and food, most notably by Avery Arrinson.\nFennimar served as a training ground and as a retreat for human and elven rangers, as well as people requiring solitude. It was also inhabited by isolated hermits. No organized communities existed anywhere in the realm."
