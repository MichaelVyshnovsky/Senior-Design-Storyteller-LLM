        "mainbody": "Olympus was a shared divine realm. In the Great Wheel cosmology, it was located in Arvandor, the first layer of Arborea.\nThe realm was a vast and plentiful pastoral environment, rich with olive groves, apple and orange orchards, and sheep herds roaming the rolling hills. The pleasant cities and villages were built with characteristic white walls along the shores of a blue sea or scattered among the mountainsides.\nTyches realm was located on the slopes of Mount Olympus in a relatively small estate among the huge temples and estates dedicated to other deities that took up residence in the realm.\nHephaestus forge lay at the centre of a volcano within an active region near the base of Mount Olympus.\nThe wilderness of the realm was populated with nature spirits that demanded tribute of travelers. The landscape was also peppered with shrines and dwellings of nymphs, satyrs, and sylphs.\nMuch of the trade in the realm was conducted in the town of Thrassos at the edge of Olympus. It was famous for its olive oil, furniture, art pieces, and works of bronze.\n* Arkenos, the largest city of the realm, located on a peninsula.\n* Evergold, a sacred pool within the realm of Aphrodite.\n* Mount Olympus, an enormous cloud-wreathed mountain that also served as a conduit between Olympus and Hades, while also passing through some places in the Prime Material plane. Its slopes contained temples dedicated to the several deities of the realm.\n* Polykeptolon, a city of philosophers and a stronghold of the Fraternity of Order.\n* Thalassia, a seaside fishing town.\n* Thrassos, a small town at the edge of the realm that contained a portal to the Outlands in its central square.\nThe Olympians refused the advancement of technology, having remained at a technological level reminiscent of the ancient ages. They were aware of the existence of new inventions, but just chose not to adopt them."
