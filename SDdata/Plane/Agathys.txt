}}'''Agathys''', also called the '''Ice-Bound''', was the sixth layer of [[Carceri]].

==Description==
Unlike other layers of Carceri, Agathys consisted of a single orb. It was one covered in black ice with red streaks in it.

==Features==
Apart from the dangers of a minor [[Negative energy|negative]]-dominant layer, Agathys was dangerously cold for unprotected people.

The air was quite thin and made it hard for people to exert themselves. Staying in one place was dangerous for anybody. People could become embedded in the ice through freezing.

==Inhabitants==
[[Petitioner]]s of Agathys were the souls of false friends and those who betrayed trust. They had to constantly move, lest they be captured in the ice. Agathys was full of frozen bodies and while they could not talk, because their lips were frozen shut, they screamed when the ice moved and crushed them. If they were helped, for which they promised anything, they betrayed their saviors at their first chance to do so.
