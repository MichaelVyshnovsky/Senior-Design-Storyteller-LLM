Urdsrest was the divine realm of Kuraulyek.
In the Great Wheel cosmology, Urdsrest was located in a cavern inside a hill on Oinos in Hades.
In the World Tree cosmology, Kuraulyeks realm was located in the Underdark of the  Barrens of Doom and Despair.
The place was described as being gloomy.
Urdsrests purpose was to be Kuraulyeks hiding spot. He never set a foot outside of it because he feared Kurtulmaks revenge for putting the entire kobold race at risk of extinction with his cowardice.
