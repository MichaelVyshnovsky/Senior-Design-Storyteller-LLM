        "mainbody": "The Demiplane of Imprisonment was an extremely obscure demiplane. Very little was known about it.\nThe demiplane resembled a crystalline cyst floating through the Ethereal Plane. The ether for  around the demiplane continuously manifested dreamscapes for the nightmares that an intelligence within sent around the multiverse to its would-be worshipers these were dominated by purple eyes, mouths, veined whirlpools, and dark humanoid figures. The visions continuously attempted to goad, tempt, and seduce travelers into touching the crystal, which would trap them in the demiplane.\nSometime after , the archwizard Madryoch was banished to this demiplane. Shadow himself used assassins he caught alive as exploration guinea pigs, making them touch its surface he never managed to retrieve them afterwards.\nPeople who touched the crystal were absorbed into the demiplane. No one could leave on their own power it took a spell like wish or miracle from someone outside the demiplane to escape. Those removed would be under the effects of an insanity, that could be healed in the same ways as the effects of the spell of the same name.\nThe archwizard Madryoch had been banished to this demiplane. Madryochs essence later escaped the imprisonment, instead being trapped in the Plane of Shadow.\nThe Demiplane of Imprisonment was a legend even to the gods. According to its legend, an irredeemably evil creature and its servants had been banished from all of reality to the Negative Material Plane by the gods that came before the gods, with this demiplane housing remnants of their forces.\nThe color of this demiplanes ethereal curtain was unrecorded. Travelers were recommended not to cross color pools of unrecognized color, lest they accidentally find themselves here. Most realms had similar legends about a demiplane of this nature, with the local theology substituted, having all come together to imprison there what remnants of the evil force they could not or would not completely annihilate."
