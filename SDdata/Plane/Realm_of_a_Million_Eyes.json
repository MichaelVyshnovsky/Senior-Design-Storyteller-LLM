        "mainbody": "The Realm of a Million Eyes was the 6 layer of the Abyss according to the Great Wheel cosmology cosmologies. It was the divine realm of the Great Mother, chief deity of the beholder pantheon.\nAlthough difficult to distinguish from other similar realms in the Dismal Caverns, the Realm of a Million Eyes was a predominantly vertical system of caverns and tunnels. The walls themselves had protruding eyes, which belonged to the Great Mother herself.\nThe Great Mothers lair lay in a large cavern at the bottom of the tunnel system, from which she endlessly spawned new beholders into existence.\nThe realm was inhabited by every type of beholder and beholderkin that existed. They constantly attacked each other on sight, as well as any visitors, including demons. Some of the oldest and most powerful beholder petitioners of the realm acted as its police force."
