The Gaping Maw, was the 88 level of the Abyss and the home of Demogorgon, Prince of Demons.
Reflecting the dual personality of its master, the Gaping Maw was a vast continent covered in a jungle and surrounded an equally vast ocean with brine flats. Rising from the sea were twin towers, topped with enormous fanged skulls that marked the fortress Abysm, a labyrinth of dark and cold underwater caves. Few could enter without succumbing to madness.
