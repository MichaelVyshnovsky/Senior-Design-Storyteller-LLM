The '''Gaping Maw''', was the 88{{th}} level of the [[Abyss]] and the home of [[Demogorgon]], Prince of Demons.

Reflecting the dual personality of its master, the Gaping Maw was a vast continent covered in a jungle and surrounded an equally vast ocean with brine flats. Rising from the sea were twin towers, topped with enormous fanged skulls that marked the fortress [[Abysm]], a labyrinth of dark and cold underwater caves. Few could enter without succumbing to madness.
