        "Description": "Niflheim consisted mostly of forestland with bluffs that jutting out, which quickly fell away. Put simply, the layer looked like a gray version of a forestland on the [[Prime Material plane]].\n\nNiflheim had no [[disease]] problem like [[Oinos]], the first layer, had. The air was cooler than on Oinos. This gave rise to fog. This fog had some properties that made life on Nilfheim harder. First, vision was limited. Even with [[darkvision]], people could not see further than {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} at most. Second, the mist had sound impeding effects. These two made predators, of which [[troll]]s, [[fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[dire wolf|dire]] and normal [[wolf|wolves]] were the most common, dangerous. Third, the resulting dampness caused non-tended metal to rust.",
        "Cosmography": "[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash, had its roots at the heart of Niflheim. There, the [[dragon]] [[Nidhogg]] endlessly and furiously chewed on the tree, carving a hole in its roots. The dragon usually ignored travelers going up and down the branches, but furiously defended herself and her progeny against threats.",
        "Notable Locations": ";[[Death of Innocence]]\n: The town was unique as its citizens did not succumb to the hopelessness and apathy of Hades.\n;[[Palace of Loss]]\n: The Palace of Loss was the [[divine realm]] of [[Shar]].{{ Cite book/Faiths & Avatars|138}}\n;[[Shadow Keep]]\n: The Shadow Keep was the divine realm of [[Mask]].{{ Cite book/Faiths & Avatars|109}} \n;Annwn\n:Also known as the Ten Isles of the cursed, the divine realm of Arawn.",
        "Inhabitants": ";[[Viliki Cainor]]\n: She was the leader of the town Death of Innocence and the reason why its citizens did not fall into apathy like everywhere else on Hades.\n;Mask\n:The [[deity]] of thieves was usually travelling but had his realm on Nilfheim.\n;Shar\n:The goddess of night considered an alliance with [[Kelemvor]], another god of Hades.\n;Arawn\n:The Celtic god of life and death. Who has his divine realm in the mist of a vast ocean.[[Colin McComb]] (October 1996). ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]''. Edited by [[Ray Vallese]]. ([[TSR, Inc.]]), p. 69.
