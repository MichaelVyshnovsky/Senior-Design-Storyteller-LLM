        "mainbody": "Niflheim, also called Northmens Despair was the second layer, also called second gloom, of Hades.\nNiflheim consisted mostly of forestland with bluffs that jutting out, which quickly fell away. Put simply, the layer looked like a gray version of a forestland on the Prime Material plane.\nNiflheim had no disease problem like Oinos, the first layer, had. The air was cooler than on Oinos. This gave rise to fog. This fog had some properties that made life on Nilfheim harder. First, vision was limited. Even with darkvision, people could not see further than  at most. Second, the mist had sound impeding effects. These two made predators, of which trolls, fiendish dire and normal wolves were the most common, dangerous. Third, the resulting dampness caused non-tended metal to rust.\nYggdrasil, the World Ash, had its roots at the heart of Niflheim. There, the dragon Nidhogg endlessly and furiously chewed on the tree, carving a hole in its roots. The dragon usually ignored travelers going up and down the branches, but furiously defended herself and her progeny against threats.\nDeath of Innocence\n The town was unique as its citizens did not succumb to the hopelessness and apathy of Hades.\nPalace of Loss\n The Palace of Loss was the divine realm of Shar.\nShadow Keep\n The Shadow Keep was the divine realm of Mask. \nAnnwn\nAlso known as the Ten Isles of the cursed, the divine realm of Arawn.\nViliki Cainor\n She was the leader of the town Death of Innocence and the reason why its citizens did not fall into apathy like everywhere else on Hades.\nMask\nThe deity of thieves was usually travelling but had his realm on Nilfheim.\nShar\nThe goddess of night considered an alliance with Kelemvor, another god of Hades.\nArawn\nThe Celtic god of life and death. Who has his divine realm in the mist of a vast ocean.Colin McComb (October 1996). On Hallowed Ground. Edited by Ray Vallese. (TSR, Inc.), p. 69. ISBN 0-7869-0430-5."
