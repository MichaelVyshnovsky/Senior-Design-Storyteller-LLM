Clangor was one of the realms of Avalas, the first layer of Acheron.
Clangor was a plane of eternal battle. Armies of goblin and kobold petitioners clashed in struggle, only to be resurrected the following dawn to start the battle again, over and over.
It was the home plane of the gods Hruggek, Kurtulmak, and Maglubiyet.
Hruggek resided in Hruggekolohk, a warren of caves inhabited by small villages of hobgoblin petitioners, waging war with the tactics of ambush.
Kurtulmak lived in another warren of caves, Draukari. The caves were narrow, short, muddy, and so twisted that it was very easy to get lost and get ambushed by an angry tribe of kobolds.
Maglubiyet resided in a fort called Grashmog, the Hearth of Battle. Grashmog served as a temple and training camp for clerics and warriors. The most feared ones were the Steelbiters, respected for their bond with the fiendish winter wolf mounts.
