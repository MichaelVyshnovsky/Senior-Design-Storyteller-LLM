The Sea of Timelessness was a divine realm within the Elemental Plane of Water belonging to Istishia, the power of elemental water.
This realm existed within the Great Wheel cosmological model.
In the Waveriding ceremony performed by Istishias clergy, water elementals were said to bring the gifts bestowed upon them back to this realm.
