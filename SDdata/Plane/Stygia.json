        "Description": {
            "Geography": "The Stygian landscape consisted of many rises and falls. Much of it was high, such as the endless, tumbled mountains of ice and frozen rock. There were also long, twisting, rocky canyons and hanging valleys, and even a few volcanic rifts in the mountains called steam trenches.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|30-32}} The treacherous alpine and glacial ice made scaling Stygia without the aid of magic like ''[[spider climb]]'' difficult,{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|44}} not to mention that avalanches were common.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|26}}\n\nCloser towards the center of Stygia, the encircling mountains were left behind in favor of a vast salt swamp which filled much of the layer. Contrary to what the word swamp might imply, the Stygian swamp was still a frozen place, although one with an interesting explanation. For eons, tiny arctic plants and mosses took root in Stygia's thick ice, sending tendrils deep inside it to gather what little nutrients there were, and the millennia of decay underwent by such plants created cold swamps atop the pack ice. The areas of thickest swamp were the most hospitable, although naturally this meant they were the places a wide variety of other creatures found more comfortable. Furthermore, these were also the places the layer was the warmest, and the dangers of falling through the ice were exponentially higher there.\n\nThe frozen white landscape of Stygia juxtaposed the black waters of its lightless seas and the Styx.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|40}} The Styx's waters fell from the mountains and swelled into the swamp, and from the river's bottom, [[opal]]s and [[topaz]] could be dredged up.\n\nThere was no sun in the Stygia, just a gloomy sky filled with smoky black clouds and a landscape of eternal twilight dimmed by the long shadows cast by great icebergs. Rather, the fifth layer was illuminated by the constant flashing of lightning, although that might be an overstatement since one could only see up to {{SI|180|ft|long=yes}} away. Regardless, electrical storms in Stygia were common to the point of being ubiquitous; there was no break in the the lightning, and following every bolt was thunder, creating a steady, subdued, ever-distant roar that echoed across the icy plains. Other noteworthy qualities included the sharp stench of frozen-over ordure sometimes in the air and the shooting stars of smoking ice that sometimes hurtled across the sky from the peaks and plunged deep into the swamp.",
            "Cold": "It was obvious enough that Stygia was cold, cold enough that long-term exposure and even worse if one entered the frigid water. For example there were the cold fires, weird white flames that were horribly freezing to the touch. They burned on rocky peaks where lightning struck for some time, although it was unclear what was fueling them given that they seemingly blazed on bare rock and left no trace on it or the ice.\n\nStygia was also the source of Stygian ice, an extraplanar form of ice infused with the plane's soulless evil and the waters of the Styx. The black substance constantly crawled with a thin layer of pale blue mist, was colder than normal ice (though it still melted if in an area above {{SI|40|F}}, albeit slowly) and when melted gave off nauseating vapors. But what made Stygian ice particularly deadly was not what it did to the body, but its faster effect on the mind. Those making contact suffered its magic, freezing cold and had their memories slowly frozen. Further contact brought physical debilitation that ended with the victim rising as a wraith in a under a minute.\n\nThe drawbacks of weaponing the ice was that it was somewhat fragile, being only slightly harder than normal ice, and could be destroyed with flame, especially magical flame. Furthermore, unless wielded with extreme finesse or by one immune to the cold, it would inflict the same torments on its wielder as it would their opponent."

        "Cosmography": {
            "River Styx": "Stygia was varyingly described as the headwaters{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|33-34}} The river never seemed to actually go anywhere, for while its waters rushed in consistent directions on any given plane (never emptying nor flooding its banks) its course was inconsistent across the planes. The river fell from the mountains of the Frozen Wastes, slowing as it ended in the Stygian swamp and sea, only for the [[merrenoloth]]s (the infamous [[daemon]]ic boatmen of the river) to take their skiffs through the swamp and pass on to other planes without having to climb back out through the mountains.\n\nRegardless of if it was the beginning or the end, Stygia's relation to the Styx was unique. Not only did the Styx clear a channel there, which normally only occurred on the top layers of the [[lower planes]], From Stygia's waters, already befouled with detritus and flotsam, the river grew progressively more polluted as it made its way through the other lower planes, picking up more debris as it went, until coming back into Stygia and depositing the new filth on the layer's icebergs.\n\nBy some accounts the river Styx had been diluted in Stygia, which reduced the river's memory-robbing influence,",
            "World Axis": "In the [[World Axis cosmology]] model, the Nine Hells were a planet-shaped [[astral dominion]] floating in the [[Astral Sea]], no longer of infinite size nor consisting of layers. In this cosmology Stygia was a vast, dark, icy cavern about {{SI|1500|mi|k|long=yes}} across and a few miles high, one supported by a handful of mountainous columns that rose like islands from the layer's oceans. The frozen sea was dotted with jagged, towering icebergs, and dimly lit by the faint auroras of green-blue frostfire that flickered in the upper reaches of the cavern and cast long shadows across the landscape.\n\nStygia sat about as deep within Hell's sphere as the upper layer of Phlegethos, but was hundreds of miles away, underlying the 2{{nd}} layer of [[Dis]] instead due to the twists and turns of the plane's caverns. It was connected to its technically neighboring Hell by way of the Road of Cinders, a torturous, broken maze of lava tubes and rifts which grew colder and darker until one finally left the heat of Phlegethos for the cold of the Stygian shores. There were also a path of dismal, miles-long, ice-coated, iron stairs hidden in one of Stygia’s mountain-columns that connected Stygia and Dis. \n\nAt Stygia's farther shore, several long, icebound canals led off into the darkness, going hundreds of miles from Stygia to the cavern of Malbolge.\n\nIn the World Axis, the Styx slowly and sluggishly wandered from [[Minauros]] to Stygia, taking a long, dark journey to the icy sea that included a precipitous plunge. Curiously, there were also several well-guarded, icy portals adrift in the sea near Tantlin that linked Stygia to various parts of the [[Material Plane]]."

            "Divine Realms": "* [[Ankhwugaht]], the [[divine realm]] of [[Set]], a burning hot desert that stood in stark contrast to the surrounding frozen landscape despite sharing its similarly twilit sky and glaciated soil.

From his great black pyramid in the center of the realm he could gaze upon his entire domain and plotted for dominance over the multiverse.\n\n* [[Sheyruushk]], the divine realm of [[Sekolah]], an aquatic realm miles beneath the frozen surface of Stygia.

        "Inhabitants": {
            "Devils": "Stygia was a realm wracked by war where lesser devils were sent to have their martial skills sharpened, their endurance increased, and their abilities assessed by their commanders so they could be assigned in appropriate legions when the time came for them to report to [[Blood War]] duty in Avernus. Devils bound to Levistus or Geryon not needed for that conflict engaged in combat regardless in the form of constant skirmishes against the other archdevil's forces, though when Levistus's dukes needed to keep their armies occupied they had them construct the bridges that connected the plane's icebergs.\n\nMost devils avoided Stygia, its bitterly cold seas able to quench even their infernal fires. Most devils could also survive and resist the Styx waters,\n\nStygia's devil population was unique in that pit fiends were not truly supreme there. they gave the cold lands of Stygia in particular a wide berth. Rather, it was the [[amnizu]]s, the styx devils, who ruled the roost in Stygia, acting as Levistus's most trusted chancellors and sycophants. and went so far as to tell them they were above Hell's laws, making them arrogant and believe themselves outside the baatezu hierarchy. As such, the already treacherous devils were particularly untrustworthy when it came to pit fiends, and even routinely subverted and outright defied the Dark Eight to advance Levistus's agenda, all part of the archdevil's plan to tip the balance of ruling support and expand his power.\n\nStygia was the primary dwelling of the amnizu, and the city of Tantlin held the greatest concentration of their kind. they turned their armies to serve their own ends,\n\nAs for the other diabolic denizens of Stygia, one of the most common were the [[gelugon]]s. Stygia was the second favorite layer of the ice devils next to even colder [[Cania]]. They could [[polymorph]] into giant sharks to more efficiently fight in its putrid waters, although they put that off as long as possible, instead magically flying over the water since they were deft enough to avoid the lightning. Stygia was also one of the largest population centers for [[succubi]] in the Hells, rivaling Dis and Malbolge in that regard.<ref>{{Cite dragon/417/Ecology of the Succubus|20}} [[Cornugon]]s were also notable for dwelling in groups within every known steam trench, as well as occupying the volcanic rifts of the layer's mountains when not ordered elsewhere.\n\nOther devils common in Stygia included the aforementioned erinyes,\n\nWhile not necessarily present, one also had to mention the existence of [[cambion]]s dedicated to Levistus. These chained cambions were guardians and torturers completely restrained by their bindings, which crawled along the ground to let them maneuver and acted as a conduit to their tortured psyche, allowing them to shoot the minds of their victims into the frozen dark of Stygia through the metal's touch.",

        },
        "History, Rumors and Legends": {
            "Levistus and Geryon": "As far as could be ascertained, Stygia was originally ruled by the archdevil Levistus.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|2-5}} Levistus was an ancient being, said by experts to be older than even Dispater (a claim Dispater's supporters contested), He had proven himself able and cunning when the baatezu first conquered Baator, and it was his charm and competence that saw him installed as Stygia's Lord of the Nine.\n\nFor eons Levistus ruled Stygia, earning himself a reputation across the planes as a legendary swordsman who ended many conflicts in lethal duels. Geryon was also present at this time, and believed to have been an ally of Asmodeus from before the baatezu devils had come to be. Though a powerful archdevil, he ruled no plane of his own, and instead served as Asmodeus's personal agent, acting as his herald, spy, saboteur and advisor in the Hells.{{Cite dungeon/176/Codex of Betrayal: Geryon, the Broken Beast|58-61}} Otherwise he went when on pillaging expeditions when summoned to the Material Planes by foolish mortals, netting himself great wealth.\n\nYet Levistus, powerful as he was, was not content with his station. Indeed, the \"rogue archdevil\" as he was known, was a treacherous sort even back then and even by the standards of devilkind. He was among the first fiends to try and overthrow Asmodeus, having had ambitions beyond his realm and plots to achieve them just after being granted it.",
            "Levistus's Crime": "There was some conflict as to whether Levistus had been deposed before in the ancient past, perhaps even more than once. He and Geryon were sometimes described as having fought over Stygia even before he was frozen and sometimes not. In any case, Asmodeus was known to have demoted archdevils, but Levistus's infamous offense was considered sufficiently grievous that the fact he was merely imprisoned could be seen as a mercy. \n\nSoon after his latest triumph over Geryon, Levistus believed he found a path to Asmodeus's defeat, specifically through his household. The public story was that Levistus went before Asmodeus's consort [[Bensozia]], who by this time had achieved sufficient esteem and trust from Asmodeus that she was sent to inspect other Hells along with the King of Hell's constable [[Martinet]] and several pit fiends. As she traveled through Stygia, Levistus offered to make her his queen in exchange for helping him overthrow her master or outright attempted to ravish her. For her refusal Levistus murdered her and all guards but Martinet, who escaped. \n\nThis version of events was almost certainly propaganda, for Bensozia hated Asmodeus for her own reasons, the depth of her loathing being something not even Asmodeus predicted. The alternative, whispered version of events painted a much different picture. Rather than refusal, Bensozia accepted the archdevil rake's proposal, and allied with him for many years, traveling to Stygia whenever she could to whisper secrets and provide him every possible advantage. This was depicted as a loveless, exploitative partnership done only out of mutual desire to unseat Asmodeus. But Levistus's long-running weakness had always been his compulsive need to betray, even at his own cost, and their conspiracy was eventually unraveled by Asmodeus's disobedient daughter, Glasya.\n\nOn one of Levistus's visits to Asmodeus's court, the dashing rogue stole the heart of the Princess of Hell, and in her Levistus saw the opportunity to further turn Asmodeus's family against him. He maintained a second affair with Asmodeus's daughter, fully aware of the danger if any one of them knew the extent of his actions but unable to resist the temptation of such a treacherous tryst. That very thing happened when Glasya, having come to Stygia after another fight with her father, found her mother occupying the very arms she hoped to flee to. Glasya, who already hated her mother, was driven to murder her on her way back from Nessus.\n\nWhen Martinet, charged with enforcing order in the Hells, discovered the assassination, he moved quickly, concluding that the disaster would make Asmodeus seem weak. He slew the other pit fiend witnesses and pinned the murder on Levistus. Thus was Levistus framed to cover up his true crime, breaking the household of Asmodeus through his simultaneous affair with his wife and daughter. Whether or not Asmodeus ever cared for Bensozia, allowing the one charged with her murder to go unpunished could not be abided. Levistus was stripped of his title, sealed in ice and had his domain passed to Geryon but a few years after getting it back.",
            "Geryon's Reign": "Geryon's rule (at least as to be described) seemed to extend both before and after the murder of Bensozia.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|34}} In ironic contrast to ambitious Levistus, Geryon initially resented his position of increased authority and pined for his relative freedom, but he slowly came to enjoy it, becoming more cruel and malicious as he came to appreciate tormenting his inferiors and playing infernal politics. Reports varied on how long he ruled, but accounts describe it (and Levistus's imprisonment) as lasting for centuries if not millenia.\n\nDuring Geryon's dominion he ruled from Tantlin, which was best described as his castle, and seldom left. There he would delight in luring powerful creatures from beyond the Hells to Stygia with carefully crafted tales of magic, knowledge or treasure in hopes of making them the prey in one of his unsporting hunts. He delighted in physically battling lesser devils and captured intruders, sometimes chasing them for long periods throughout the halls of Tantlin. At times these hunts would lead out into the gravel-strewn quarries nearby, where spinagons, hamatula, hunt survivors and similar subjects forever mined stone blocks for the walls of Tantlin and other places in the Hells.\n\nDuring this time, Geryon was perhaps the most content out of all the archdevils, and the least interested in the endless political struggle of his kind (at least as a vehicle for the incessant pursuit of power, he never missed a chance to act against his hateful neighbors). During his long tenure he was relatively weak among the archdevils, and did not distinguish himself from his peers much, but neither was he seriously threatened or troubled. His vassals were outwardly loyal and often called upon to aid his interests.\n\nGeryon's chief lieutenant Amon{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|33}} Geryon also retained the service of the \"Prince of Beasts\" [[List of archdevils|Alloces]] for several years, the monster-making fiend keeping his menagerie of bestial horrors, acting as a combination kennel-master, huntmaster, head breeder and creature creator.{{Cite dragon/373/Codex of Betrayal: Alloces, the Butcher of Nessus|38}}\n\nGeryon's sovereign interests meanwhile were safeguarded by his magistrate [[Herodias]] and his bailiff [[Gorson]] under the watchful eye of his consort [[Cozbi]], who despite her quiet ways was attentive and not easily tricked. Herodias maintained the realms security, assuming command over the defenses during Geryon's hunts while otherwise training and ordering Geryon's bone devil legions, while Gorson observed the daily goings on and internal politics of the Hells as a whole while ordering and coordinating the amnizu in Geryon's absence. Thus they held much of the actual power in Stygia while acting in Geryon's name, allowing Geryon to continue his hunts while retaining his influence (if not increasing it).\n\nNotably during this period, amnizu did not occupy the preeminent position in Stygia they later would. They dwelled in the swamp, constantly tormenting lemures as they splashed and wailed in the muck unless they were summoned for a mission. But sometimes bone devils or horned devils would enter the swamp, and if not to join in the fun, would start chasing a few of the styx devils, forcing all others present to band together to drive the interlopers out.\n\nOther noteworthy events during this period included a ploy by [[Baalzebul]], then ruler of both Maladomini and Malbolge, to manipulate mortals into removing a gem known as the Devilbane from Stygia. This prompted forces from Geryon and Asmodeus himself to try and seize the gem from the warded holy tower in which it was kept, as well as a counterattack by celestial forces under [[Tyr]] and [[Osiris]]. It was during this event that Set was in the process of building a pyramid in Stygia. Not content with his dominion in Avernus, his mad, yet ultimately successful plan was to use the structure as a focal point of power to gain a \"beachhead\" in the Frozen Wastes, which would ultimately become his new primary plane in the Great Wheel. Sekolah meanwhile was already present, and known to converse and often devour Geryon's ambassadors, even if Geryon himself wasn't afraid of the seabound god.",
            "The Reckoning": "The stability of Geryon's reign would begin to falter at a certain point. His influence began to fade and Alloces abandoned him in favor of a mercenary approach to his services.{{Cite dragon/360/Infernal Aristocracy: The Dukes of Hell|41-43}}\n\nGeryon fed Asmodeus information on the conspirators’ activities up until the final encounter. It was his great horn, the symbol of his authority during his regime, that signalled the pit fiend commanders to turn on their archdevils. Surrounded by Asmodeus's armies and their own turned against them, the archdevils were left in humiliated disarray. Moloch, however, did not retreat, bolstered by the poisonous words of Malagard offered to him at Geryon's request. For his defiance he was one of the only lords to be officially and truly removed from power at the end of the Reckoning.\n\n\nBut to the surprise of everyone, the other lord in that category was Geryon himself, the only duke to remain loyal. Stunned, Geryon was stripped of his rulership and a substantial portion of his strength before being banished. Then, to the dismay of everyone,{{Cite dragon/427/Codex of Betrayal: Levistus|17}}",
            "The Frozen Prince": "Levistus had wasted away in his icy tomb for millenia if not eons,\n\nLevistus's operatives attacked and slew most of Geryon’s generals, lest they plot against the newcomers. This fighting was furthered by the infamous pit fiend that took over Tantlin after Geryon's fall, who encouraged it to happen within city walls.{{Cite dragon/428/Codex of Betrayal: Amon the Wolf|23}} With Agares and Malphas remaining and tentatively at his command, Levistus began his long-awaited revenge.\n\nRivals who believed Levistus's condition would limit him usually suffered for their miscalculation.{{Cite dragon/223/The Lords of the Nine|11-12}}\n\nIn reality, the Frozen Prince's subtle schemes played out slowly but inexorably,{{Cite dragon/223/The Lords of the Nine|15}} \n\nSome of the Material Plane believed Levistus was not interested in politics, but most planar beings knew otherwise. Levistus was constantly plotting to steal power from his rivals and had every intent to conquer an adjacent layer of Hell (probably the sixth) in the likely mistaken belief that such power would allow him to break free. He garnered a reputation for being particularly greedy in this regard compared to his peers, such that word spread in Stygia of a coming assault for which his amnizus were recruiting mercenaries. Such blatant maneuvers at their collective expense alienated Levistus from any lords who would still deal with one so outside Asmodeus's favor.\n\nBut Levistus's true plan of this era extended beyond simple power grabs and territory skirmishes, being so grand in scope that his peers would likely question if it was possible. Not long after first being frozen, Levistus began stockpiling souls in his prison, and he and his remaining loyalists rationed their soul consumption to the point of starvation. This rationing was extended to all Stygia upon his return to power, turning the fifth layer into a place of desperately ravenous devils. Souls were traded for acts of treachery or for even more souls in exchange for one specifically desired by another devil, netting even more for his ever-swelling vault. All this was merely the preparation for his plot's climax.{{Cite dragon/427/Codex of Betrayal: Levistus|18}} \n\nLevistus's true plan was to turn Stygia into the second wall in a barrier enclosing the middle Hells. Prior to imprisonment he already had dealings with figures beyond Asmodeus's direct control, such as exiled archdevils and forsaken former creatures of the Hells. These would lead splinter cells of pirates and saboteurs in his greater network. When everything was ready, the Rogue Archdevil's motley crew of infernal outcasts would cut off the flow of souls into the Hells from its starting point: Avernus. Combined with some bribes to powerful figures like Moloch and the [[Dark Eight]], the siege would allow Levistus to slowly advance on the upper layers, sieging his enemies into submission, for only his devils were accustomed to soul starvation. Those below could suffer until he was ready for them, the poetic irony of the plot being that his rivals, even Asmodeus, would fall knowing the feeling of being trapped in one's own domain.",
            "Return of Geryon": "Geryon's fate after his loss of position was unclear. There were reports of banishment, destruction and some sort of final battle for control before he faded into ambiguity in Stygia. However, one of his last known appearances before his proper re-emergence made clear the sheer diabolical depths of Asmodeus's machinations.\n\nIt was speculated that Asmodeus was concerned with Levistus's designs on another layer, and so called the brooding Geryon to his fortress of [[Malsheem]] with an offer to support his reinstatement, provided that he serve in his plan. He had foreseen the threat Levistus would inevitably pose centuries ago and allowed it to play out up until the Rogue Archdevil no longer served his purposes, all while simultaneously establishing the mechanism to unseat him through Geryon. All Geryon had to do to fully win his support was conquer the [[Temple of Neohed]], which would teleport below the ice of Stygia as part of Asmodeus's own plans for a global corruption event.\n\nAware ahead of time where Neohed would arrive, Geryon designed and built Coldsteel, completing construction and gathering his forces there in secret. Despite Geryon's efforts Levistus was aware of Coldsteel and had his amnizu watch it to learn more, even offering encouragement to adventurers seeking to go down there for their own purposes. In the ensuing chaos, Geryon's consort Cozbi, up until now kept alive with magic and machinery long after she should have died, finally perished too. The invasion ultimately appeared to have been stopped, for Geryon's power was not restored, and the deposed duke was left to languish once again as Asmodeus was denied his prize.",
            "Levistus's Temptation": "Despite Geryon's lack of success, Levistus had his own troubles to worry about. Though he had kept her occupied beforehand, the nameless pit fiend of Tantlin had descended into anarchy that only grew worse as time went on, with gang fights being amazingly common and the city effectively run by criminals. So encompassing was the chaos that Levistus's rivals began questioning his lawful credentials. Before the complaints reached a crescendo he was forced to act; he reinstated his authority, rewarding survivors with positions and promotions, while having his amnizu factorums freeze the former ruler solid and shatter her into shards, which would become highly coveted collectibles in Stygia.\n\nLevistus was further challenged by the rise of Glasya after the death of [[Malagard]], who had risen to rule Malbolge after Moloch ( and whose ritual to godhood Geryon was rumored to have a hand in ruining).\n\nBy raising Levistus up to rule Stygia without releasing him from his prison, the energy taken from Geryon that would have gone to his replacement could be preserved to promote Glasya, with the Hag Countess acting as a mere placeholder until his daughter was ready to take the throne. Under this theory, Levistus's blatant acts of antagonism was simply a smokescreen to distract from Asmodeus's plan for his child. If this theory was true, it would only further accentuate the multilayered complexity behind Asmodeus's schemes. Levistus himself had come to accept the theory despite loathing its implications, namely that all his own plots were simply cogs in Asmodeus's greater machine.\n\nFurthermore, Glasya's rise posed a more direct threat to Levistus. Whatever his history with Glasya and her mother, she expressed utter hatred towards him and intent to murder him. Generally this was considered an empty threat given his current invulnerability, and she lacked the power to mount a full-scale invasion of Stygia. However, she notably had a strange alliance with the nominal ruler of Phlegethos at the time, Fierna. Unlike her father Belial, Fierna had no interest in frozen Stygia, which was made all the stranger by the fact that the pyromantic archduchess was also immune to cold, which led some to speculate she was seeking mastery of the element to take over Stygia or Cania. It was not unlikely that Glasya intended to use Fierna to shore up her forces when she finally attacked Stygia, a scheme to be considered given that the archduchesses were \"friends\" and Fierna had her cold immunity even before Glasya's rule of Malbolge. \n\nIn the wake of these changes, Levistus's core instinct to betray rose anew, and his patience ebbed. Though he knew he should behave himself, it was at this time he nevertheless accelerated his plans to upend Hell's power structure. Once again he intended to go after Asmodeus, specifically by subverting his court, and even by trying to seduce Asmodeus's rebellious daughter once more.\n\nAround the time the [[Blood War]] was restarting during the [[Second Sundering]], the battles that took place in Stygia left parts of the Frozen Wastes utterly destroyed,",
            "The War Goes On": "When Geryon finally disappeared from infernal history, he had lost all hope for the future and began to question the point of his own existence. It was that Asmodeus, who hungered for the souls of those with shattered faith, feasted well upon his, after which he was little more than a [[vestige]]. Geryon aimlessly wandered the [[Astral plane]] wracked with despair, believed by many to have died or returned to the astral energies of the wider planes. In truth he found himself called to [[Tytherion]], the Endless Night, where he was but one devil amon a wasteland of many kinds of exiles. Alone he brooded in his cave before he came to the conclusion that Asmodeus would not cast him out without cause, and that he must desire him to do something that even the King of Hell could not be directly implicated in.\n\nWhatever the ultimate cause or result of his deliberation, Geryon would eventually return to Stygia once more, intent to reclaim his lost status and still bitter about Asmodeus's rejection. He retook Citadel Coldsteel, close as it was to the plane's center like the city of Tantlin, and from there schemed to take Stygia back from Levistus. Unable to directly affect each other, the two archdevils turned Stygia into an outright warzone, with both sides seeking the knowledge to cement the position of their leader once and for all. Even this battle of Stygia, however, was thought by sages to be yet another ploy by Asmodeus, a test staged in hopes of purging the worst impulses of his minions, and if not, to clear the way for a new competent to rise up and rule Stygia in their stead."
