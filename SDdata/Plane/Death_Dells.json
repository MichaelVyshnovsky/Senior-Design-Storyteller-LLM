        "mainbody": "he Death Dells, also called Yeenoghus Realm or the Seeping Woods, was the 422 layer of the Abyss. It was the realm of the demon prince Yeenoghu.\nThe Death Dells were a sweltering realm lit by a low-hanging red sun. The central region was the Dun Savannah, inhabited by feral gnolls and dominated by Yeenoghu. It was bordered to the north by the Screaming Peaks, beyond which was Azaels Waste, the last remnant of the former rulers realm and the one region that Yeenoghu could not shape to his will. The Seeping Woods proper formed the traditional western border to Yeenoghus wanderings, while the Curswallow sea to the west touched upon the Abyssian Ocean.\nYeenoghus fortress was a massive iron construction pulled around his realm by innumerable slaves. It made stops at the three main encampments, Vujak-Sesko, Vujak-Riln, and Vujak-Kesk, as well as the Great Gate, a portal that could be manipulated to open to many Material worlds and which was used to resupply Yeenoghu with slaves, and Bechards Landing, a spit of rock on the shores of the Curswallow where the ancient obyrith had spent millenia dying a slow death.\nThe Death Dells were primarily inhabited by countless gnolls and other creatures that served Yeenoghu, such as hyenodons, hyenas, and shoosuvas. It was also inhabited less willingly by countless mortal slaves that served as laborers and food, some of whom were fortunate enough to escape.\nIn ancient times, the layer was ruled by the obyrith lord Bechard, who was eventually felled by tanarri treachery, his connection to the layer severed. After him the demon lord Azael ruled the layer, which became a vast desert of shifting dunes and ruined cities under his reign. However, after the bestial god-killer Ma Yuan briefly visited the layer, only an oily stain was left of Azael. Yeenoghu later rose to become the next ruler of the layer."
