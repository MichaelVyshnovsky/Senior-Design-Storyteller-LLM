        "Inhabitants": "Many celestial beings inhabited the Gates of the Moon. The angelic servants of Selûne were female [[planetar]]s known as the [[Shards]]. as did the [[sliver]]s.<ref group=\"note\">The ''[[Player's Guide to Faerûn]]'' does not explicitly state that the Court of Stars exists in the Forgotten Realms, but it does say on page 154 the eladrin had their \"faerie court\" here and on page 189 that \"Queen [[Morwel]] resides in the Gates of the Moon with her consort, [[Faerinaal]].\" It is left as matter of interpretation for the DM how to incorporate the material on page 150 of the ''[[Book of Exalted Deeds (sourcebook)|Book of Exalted Deeds]]''. Most numerous were the [[petitioner]]s of all the deities that had a realm here. These included the embodied spirits of sailors, female spellcasters, good-hearted [[lycanthrope]]s, [[bards]], explorers, wanderers, travelers, and mystics. They appeared much paler than they did in life.\n\nMany mortals also lived in or visited the Gates of the Moon. In the [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR]], at the moment of the [[Fall of Netheril]], Selûne rescued the Netherese enclave of [[Selûnarra]] by transporting it to this plane, where it resided ever since. Over the years, the Selûnarrans interbred with Selûne's servitors and their descendant [[aasimar]]s inherited the floating city.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Mahogany]], a city located on a swampy river delta",
        "Realms": "* [[Selûne]], Our Lady of Silver, resided in the shining silver hall of [[Argentil]] in the center of the Gates of the Moon. Argentil was a place of beauty, quietness, and moonlight. The Gates of the Moon were originally her realm alone, and she remained its ruler.\n* [[Finder Wyvernspur]], the Nameless Bard, moved his realm, Fermata, from [[Arvandor (layer)|Olympus]] to the halls of Argentil. The sound of music filled his chambers and he decorated all of Selûne's walls with artwork made by his petitioners.\n* [[Gwynharwyf]], the Whirling Fury, was known to wander about the Gates of the Moon and [[Arvandor]] when not leading [[barbarian]] hordes in battle. She did not have a specific realm to call home.\n* [[Lliira]], Our Lady of Joy, became an [[exarch]] of Sune and moved here from the plane of [[Brightwater]] with her after the Spellplague.\n* [[Morwel]], Queen of Stars, ruler of the [[eladrin]], and her consort, [[Faerinaal]], made their home in a timeless demiplane attached to the Gates of the Moon.\n* [[Sharess]], the Dancing Lady, became an exarch with her after the Spellplague.\n* [[Shaundakul]], the Rider of the Winds, blew through all the planes, but called this plane home. He had no grand hall however, at least none to Argentil's scale.\n* [[Sune|Sune Firehair]] created the romantic city of Brightwater here after the Spellplague. It was named after her previous home, the [[World Tree]] plane of Brightwater.\n* [[Tymora]], Lady Luck, also moved here after the Spellplague, constructing seven [[earthmote]]s and connecting them by bridges. She named her realm the Great Wheel after her former gambling quarter on the plane of Brightwater."
