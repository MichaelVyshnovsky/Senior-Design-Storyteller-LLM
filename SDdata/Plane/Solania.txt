Solania, also known as the Electrum Heaven, was the fourth layer of Mount Celestia.
The layer had a sky that glowed like burnished silver. Its valleys were enveloped in mist, fog, and strange scents. The peaks were home to numerous holy shrines, including monasteries and magnificent cathedrals controlled by demigods. Many of the slopes were rich in precious ores and minerals and were mined by populations of dwarves that resided there.
