'''Solania''', also known as the '''Electrum Heaven''', was the fourth layer of [[Mount Celestia]].

==Geography==
The layer had a sky that glowed like burnished silver. Its valleys were enveloped in mist, fog, and strange scents. The peaks were home to numerous holy shrines, including [[monasteries]] and magnificent [[cathedral]]s controlled by [[demigod]]s. Many of the slopes were rich in precious ores and minerals and were mined by populations of dwarves that resided there.

==Government==
[[File:Pistis Sophia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Pistis Sophia, ruler of Solania.'']]
The ruler of Solania was [[Pistis Sophia]], the Ascetic. Her symbol was the [[eagle]]. She was a patron of ascetics, [[monk]]s, and mystics.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Erackinor]] : Located on the slopes of Solania, where the dwarven deity [[Moradin]] made his domain, with his wife [[Berronar Truesilver]]. It was the location of the giant [[Soul Forges]], which Moradin was said to use to temper the spirits of his people.

; [[Uroboros]] : Also known as the Gates of Wisdom, the airborne realm of [[Jazirian]] of the [[couatl]], floated above the mountainside of Solania.

; [[First Monastery of the Planes-Militant]] : Located on a high plateau above the clouds, this monastery was rumored to be the source of power for all [[paladin]]s.
