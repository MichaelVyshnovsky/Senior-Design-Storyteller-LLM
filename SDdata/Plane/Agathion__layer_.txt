'''Agathion''' ({{Pronounce|a|GAY|thee|on|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}}}) was the fourth and last layer of [[Pandemonium]]. The strangest and deadliest of all four layers, it consisted of isolated chambers within an infinite expanse of solid rock.

==Geography==
The broad tunnels of [[Pandesmos]] narrowed down progressively in [[Cocytus]] and [[Phlegethon]] until they reduced to nothing in Agathion. The layer was marked by dead ends and completely isolated caverns, accessible only by ''[[portal]]s'' from the other layers and from other planes.

Only approximately half of the caverns of Agathion contained [[air]]. The other half of the chambers were in vacuum. In both cases, portals opening from other layers of Pandemonium invariably caused sudden and violent windstorms.

==History==
In the distant past, when [[Kiaransalee]] defeated [[Orcus]] and sought to remove every trace of his existence from the [[multiverse]], she had two of her servants hide the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]'' in a hidden vault buried within Agathion. The power that emanated from the wand excavated a large cave complex in the layer, as the artifact actively sought to be eventually found. Orcus, in his disguise as Tenebrous, overthrew [[Primus]] in [[Mechanus]] and ordered an extemporaneous [[Great Modron March]], which became known as the Rogue March, in an effort to learn the location of the wand.{{Cite dragon/354/Return of the Modrons|34-35}}

Some other time, the [[Lady of Pain]] defeated a powerful [[wizard]] who had challenged her and imprisoned his soul inside the ''[[Labyrinth Stone]]'', a nearly indestructible [[ebony]] gem. She hid the gem away in one of the chambers of Agathion. In the days before the [[Faction War (conflict)|Faction War]], Duke [[Rowan Darkwood]] sent a party of explorers into the layer to search for the gem, in an effort to use the wizard's power for his own gain. The party managed to access the chamber after a new passage to it was carved by the death throes of a [[deity]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The immense difficulty of locating the caverns of Agathion made them the perfect place for [[deity|deities]] to hide a variety of items. Rumors existed of [[artifact]]s, mementos, powerful monsters, languages, and even cosmologies hidden away within the natural vaults. For additional security, some of these chambers were also populated with monsters charged with protecting the hidden items.
