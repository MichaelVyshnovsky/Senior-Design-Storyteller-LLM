The Towers of Night was the largest plane in the Astral Sea as described by the World Axis cosmology model. The greater goddess Shar ruled the Towers of Night, with Talona, Sseth, and Zehir also residing there. It was known as the place where darkness reigned supreme.
The plane was a dark and terrifying place always benighted with a starless sky. It consisting of wastelands, crags, forests, bogs, black deserts, and dangerous seas and rivers. A number of foreboding citadels dotted the landscape.
