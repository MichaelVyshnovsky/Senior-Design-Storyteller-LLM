        "mainbody": "Brassberg was one of the divine realms of the draconic deity Hlal the Jester, who was usually known as Aasterinian in the Outer Planes.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, Brassberg was Hlals lair deep within Ysgards third layer, Nidavellir (her other realm was a secret lair in Arborea).The 3rd-edition Core book Races of the Dragon, still using the Great Wheel cosmology, treated Hlal and Aasterinian as distinct entities and placed the former in Arborea, the latter in the Outlands.\nIn the World Tree cosmology, the realm covered part of the lower slopes of the great Dragon Eyrie.Hlals realm was not named in the Players Guide to Faer√ªn. This article assumes that it is the same as Brassberg.\nThe lair of Hlal consisted of a number of caverns, with just the space to contain the riches collected by the dragon goddess. The surrounding area was dry and warm, as befitted the patron of brass and copper dragons.\nA portal linked Brassberg to Erevan Ileseres realm on the plane of Arvandor."
