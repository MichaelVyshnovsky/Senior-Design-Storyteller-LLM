The '''Celestial Nadir''' was an artificial [[demiplane]] created by the original [[Imaskari Empire]]. It was used as a safe place for magical experimentation should unforeseen consequences arise. It also served as a magical bridge for the [[Imaskari]], since many portals were situated in the demiplane that led to various locations on the [[Prime Material Plane]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison||11}}

==Access==
It could only be accessed from certain locations possessing standing-stone rings, and only by using a Celestial Nadir keystone.Â All the keystones were lost by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], save for one possessed by [[Ususi Manaallin|Empress Ususi]]. There were said to be twenty standing-stone rings that led to the Celestial Nadir. However, the only known standing-stone ring locations, as discovered by Empress Ususi, were the [[menhir]] ring at [[Adama's Tooth]], the [[Mucklestones]] ring in the [[Forest of Lethyr|Lethyr Forest]], and an unnamed ring in [[Skyclave]] city (formerly the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]]).

==Features==
The plane was an apparently endless void, with roads of unsupported stone. It had free-floating lakes and islands of stone, which held a number of crumbled ruins. Some of those ruins had illumination, which may have accounted for the stars.{{cite book/Darkvision||2}} The tombs of many powerful emperors drifted within some of the ruins.{{cite book/Darkvision||26}} Some other objects floating through the void included cubes made of perfect mirrors, and slabs of transparent glass with the remains of monsters embedded in them.{{cite book/Darkvision||25}} Both were prisons holding monsters in stasis.{{cite book/Darkvision||25}} and occassional sharp breezes.

The stones at Adamas' Ring led to a three-way split. One of the roads continued for a few hundred paces to a geode where Pandorym's body was held; the path around the geode was overgrown with celestial nadir crystal. Another road led to an aurora-like curtain after a few miles, behind which the Palace of the Purple Emperor was faintly visible. It served as a portal to the same. The third path seemed to lead off into the distance beyond what was visible. There were dot-like stars both above and below.{{cite book/Darkvision||25}} The path from the Mucklestones was straight for as far as the eye could see; Ususi employed it to reach Yeshelmaar sooner. A different path opened into the [[Arches of Xenosi]] in the [[Rawlinswood]], close to [[Dun-Tharos]].

The Celestial Nadir was home to a naturally occurring sediment called [[Plangent|celestial nadir crystals]], which were amethyst in color.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||14}}

==History==
Originally devised by the Imaskari to serve as a buffer between [[portal]]s, and then extended to serve as a dumping ground for unwanted experiments, refuse, creatures drawn from other planes, hazardous extraplanar material and a safehouse for valuables, the Nadir continued to grow after the destruction of the Imaskari, perhaps even absorbing other demiplanes.

In {{yearlink|-2488}}, the [[Elder evil]] [[Pandorym]] was summoned by the Imaskari, and its body was separated from its mind, leaving it inside the Celestial Nadir.{{cite book/Darkvision|219-223}} The elder evil remained imprisoned until [[Vaelan]] miners working for the [[Datharathi]] accidentally stumbled upon the Nadir in {{yearlink|1370}}. It was resealed after Ususi Manaallin and others entered the Celestial Nadir in {{yearlink|1374}}.
