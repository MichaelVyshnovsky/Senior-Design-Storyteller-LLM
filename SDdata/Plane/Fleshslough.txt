}}'''Fleshslough''' was the [[divine realm]] of [[Yurtrus]], the [[orc]] [[deity]] of death and [[disease]].

==Geography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Fleshslough was located inside of a hill in [[Oinos]] in [[Hades]]. Practically nothing was known about the realm's geography. This was due to a lack of reports about it, because nobody&mdash;including [[avatar]]s&mdash;ever returned from the realm after entering it.

In the [[World Tree cosmology]], Fleshslough was located on the [[plane]] of [[Nishrek]] on a big hill.

==Government==
Yurtrus ruled the realm.

==Rumors & Legends==
Orcish [[petitioner]]s of Nishrek told among themselves that orcs with poor fighting skills were stripped of their flesh in Fleshslough. This was a fearsome prospect for them because on Nishrek, people who died in battle were revived, so being stripped of flesh was the closest thing to true death there.

==Notable Locations==
The entry into Fleshslough was marked by a big door made of iron. Every time this door opened, the stink of death came out of the realm.
