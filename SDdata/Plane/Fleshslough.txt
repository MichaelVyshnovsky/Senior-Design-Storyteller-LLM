Fleshslough was the divine realm of Yurtrus, the orc deity of death and disease.
In the Great Wheel cosmology, Fleshslough was located inside of a hill in Oinos in Hades. Practically nothing was known about the realms geography. This was due to a lack of reports about it, because nobody&mdashincluding avatars&mdashever returned from the realm after entering it.
In the World Tree cosmology, Fleshslough was located on the plane of Nishrek on a big hill.
Yurtrus ruled the realm.
Orcish petitioners of Nishrek told among themselves that orcs with poor fighting skills were stripped of their flesh in Fleshslough. This was a fearsome prospect for them because on Nishrek, people who died in battle were revived, so being stripped of flesh was the closest thing to true death there.
The entry into Fleshslough was marked by a big door made of iron. Every time this door opened, the stink of death came out of the realm.
