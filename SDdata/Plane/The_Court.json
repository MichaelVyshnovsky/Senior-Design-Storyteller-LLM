        "Location": "The Court was on the summit of one of three great mountains surrounding the base of [[Mount Celestia]], making it&mdash;from the point of view of the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]&mdash;a part of [[Lunia]] or&mdash;from the point of view of the [[World Tree cosmology]]&mdash;a part of the [[House of the Triad]]. The realm was adjacent to that of [[Siamorphe]], whose [[Alabaster Palace]] was located in a lush vale between the Court and Celestia."
