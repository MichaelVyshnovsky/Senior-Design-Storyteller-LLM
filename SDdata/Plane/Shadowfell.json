        "mainbody": "The Shadowfell, also known as the Plane of Shadow, was one of the planes of existence in various cosmological models. Its purpose and characteristics evolved as new cosmologies were formulated. Other names for this plane included Shadowland, the Demiplane of Shadow, the Shadow Deep, and simply Shadow.\nIt existed as sort of a counterpart to the Feywild, in the sense that it was a reflection, or \"echo\", of the Prime Material Plane. Unlike the Feywild, it was a bleak, desolate place full of decay and death.\nAccording to early versions of the Great Wheel cosmology, the Plane of Shadow was considered only a demiplane. Demiplanes formed out of the proto-matter that ebbed and flowed about the Ethereal Plane, creating a finite plane with its own Border Ethereal whenever a critical mass was achieved. The largest of these was called the Demiplane of Shadow, and was made up of both positive and negative energy in equal measure. For those traveling through the Ethereal Plane, the \"curtain of vaporous color\" for the Demiplane of Shadow was the color silver. Very little was known about the Demiplane of Shadow other than it was a dim and dismal place.\nIn later and revised versions of the Great Wheel cosmology, such as the one following the Second Sundering, the Shadowfell was considered a parallel plane, or an \"echo\" of the Material Plane, coexisting with it along with the Feywild.\nIn the World Tree cosmology model, the Plane of Shadow was seen as an infinite plane that coexisted with the Prime Material Plane—touching it at all points and having the same basic geography Naturally occurring intermittent portals called vortices appeared between this plane and the Material Plane in seemingly random areas of heavy shade or darkness. The entry and exit point of a vortex were unpredictable as was their duration, lasting a few days at most.—before stepping back into the Prime, but arriving at a particular destination was much less precise than before. Intrepid travelers could still reach other universes by traversing the Shadowfell and locating the border with an alien world such as Oerth for example.\nthumb|250px|left|The desolate landscape of the Shadowfell.\nIn 1385 DR, the Year of Blue Fire, Shar succeeded in engineering the murder of Mystra by Cyric, plunging the multiverse into years of upheaval and chaos called the Spellplague. The Elemental and Energy Planes collapsed into the Elemental Chaos but not before Shar managed to manipulate some of the necrotic energies from the Negative Energy Plane and inject it into the Plane of Shadow.\nthumb|right|A swamp cabin beside the Black Rift in the Shadow Swamp.\nThe most striking and immediate impression a visitor to the Plane of Shadow experienced was the lack of color and light no sun, moon, or stars adorned the vault of the inky black sky, and all things looked as if the color had leeched out, leaving nothing but black and white, which in the dimness were more like \"dark black\" and \"light black\". A light source only illuminated half the distance it normally would, flames and fires put out less heat, and spells that dealt with light or fire were less predictable and prone to failure, whereas shadow spells were enhanced. On the other hand, although it would not illuminate as far, any light source on the plane could be spotted at a distance of up to ten times its normal range of illumination, such was the contrast to the constant gloom, similar to a star in the night sky. Even a light source that only put out shadowy illumination, like a darkness spell or a lantern burning shadowlight oil, could be seen up to five times its range of illumination.\nGravity and time were the same on the Shadowfell as on the Prime, Landmarks were usually recognizable but altered in some bizarre way buildings might be constructed in a different style, built with different materials, at a different location, and/or in any condition from dilapidated ruins to its normal appearance, for example, or otherwise strange and distorted. Similar sites were sometimes called \"shadow-analogues\".\nDue to the ever-changing landscape, the Plane of Shadow was subject to relatively frequent but very small earthquakes (called shadow quakes) that resembled an earthquake spell in an area about two hundred feet (sixty meters) in diameter. For those on the ground, damage was equivalent to a Prime earthquake, but shadow quakes could also disrupt the shadow walk spell and dump unfortunate travelers onto the Shadowfell in the middle of the disturbance at a place very likely unknown and far from their destination.\nthumb|300px|The Shadowfell was a place of death, dread, and despair.\nSome areas on the Plane of Shadow seemed to have an affinity with the Negative Energy Plane and life-draining undead such as shadows, ghosts, and vampires. These \"darklands\" had a minor negative-dominant trait and unprotected visitors immediately felt the life force being sucked from their bodies&mdashunless they exited the darkland quickly, all that was left of them was a pile of ash. Someone with protection from negative energy could stop and admire the utter desolation in an otherwise forlorn landscape, and perhaps make the acquaintance of the truly inimical undead. Thankfully, no natural vortices opened into darklands regions, preventing the unwary from stepping through into almost certain death, and keeping the creatures that thrived there from having easy access to other planes. Material Plane locations such as desecrated burial mounds, haunted battlefields, and necromantic foci frequently had a darkland echo on the Shadowfell.\nOther less dangerous but quite unsettling echoes occurred in areas analogous to towns and cities in the Prime Material Plane. They were nothing more than mirages, but familiar faces and places seen through the macabre mirror of the Shadowfell could be very demoralizing. Structures might appear altered, dislocated, destroyed, or replaced entirely by something else. Mirages of the living had visages of distorted nightmares, but were still recognizable enough to give travelers a jolt of fear and revulsion.\nAir, water, and food existed on this plane, supporting plants, animals, and some humanoids adapted to the shadow environment. Visitors could survive indefinitely if they were willing to endure thick, foul-smelling water, food that oozed dark blood, and a pervasive nip of cold in the air. A visitor could never feel warm, would often hear or sense the presence of things that werent there, and could never shake the feeling of being watched. It was a constantly unsettling place. \nThe morphic nature of the Shadowfell could produce strange effects, mainly in areas like the Black Rift that were especially morphic, and with events that had a particular affinity with the plane, like death. For example, in the Black Rift alone, a pile of bodies caused more skeletons to appear, until there were thousands. More bizarre were the strange biers upon which dead bodies spontaneously appeared, apparently drawn from wherever they rested, anywhere in existence, only to disappear after a few seconds, presumably to wherever theyd come from. Stalactites in a cave dripped ephemeral shadowstuff, which was reabsorbed into the plane rather than form a puddle. Even common mushrooms bore realistic humanoid faces, capable of twitching or blinking. More significantly, forests of grasping tendrils sprouted from some surfaces and reached for passersby, similar to the black tentacles spell.\nthumb|273x273px|A creature of the Shadowfell summoned to the mortal realm.\nKnown as \"shadowstuff\", the material of the Shadowfell could be manipulated by illusionists to form semi-real monsters and quasi-real evocations that were still effective (to a lesser degree) even if the target successfully disbelieved the illusion.\nAnother tool of illusionists was the shadow well spell, which could turn a creatures shadow into a temporary gateway into the Shadowfell. If successful, the victim was sucked into the Shadowfell through his or her shadow and spent a few moments in a pocket realm (a very tiny demiplane attached to the Shadowfell) being terrorized by dark phantasms. No physical harm resulted from this spell, but mental and emotional trauma resulting in a fear response was possible.\nAn unsuccessful attempt to build a gate to the Shadowfell could result in what was termed a failed Shadow Gate. A being that stepped through one was taken only momentarily to the Plane of Shadow, but in that moment a \"seed of shadow\" was implanted in their flesh. This could cause their flesh to be subsumed by shadow, and they would see it mist away into darkness. Many died, reduced to bare skeletons, but those who survived acquired the powers of a dark creature.\nThe earliest known conscious interaction of the peoples of Toril with the Plane of Shadow was in the time of the Imaskari empire. In the Late period, circa , the archwizard Madryoch the Ebon Flame was focused on researching the secrets of the Shadowfell and plotted to use its dark power to overthrow Lord Artificer Omanond. His plans were thwarted by a young adept named Hilather. Knowledge of the existence of the Plane of Shadow was presumably lost with the fall of the Imaskari empire because it was some three thousand years later, in the Year of Plentiful Wine, &minus533 DR, that the Netherese rediscovered it and began their study.\nIn 1235 DR, the Black Horde attacked Faerûn. The Horde defeated Eldrith the Betrayer, who would go on to betray Baldurs Gate. They killed her and she was reborn out of hatred. In her soul of hatred, the Onyx Tower was created and tied to her life. The Onyx Heart was located in the Plane of Shadow and only with its destruction could the Onyx Tower be destroyed.\nAn adventurer and their companions were exploring the ruined Netherese city of Undrentide in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. In an Arcanists Tower, they slipped through portals into its dark reflection on the Shadowfell, where they encountered shades. The adventurer later escaped impending doom by traveling back to the Plane of Shadow using a magic mirror.\nAlthough the souls of the dead did not begin to be drawn to the Shadow Plane until after the Spellplague and Shar transformed it into the Shadowfell, it was possible to trap a soul there. Notably, this happened to a king of Damara, Gareth Dragonsbane, in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, by a cabal of wizards allied to the lich Sammaster. King Gareths soul was rescued in the following year by a phalanx of paladins led by the smoke drake Brimstone.\nIn the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Sharran and Cyricist cultists based in the Shadow Swamp on the Plane of Shadow, plotted to tear apart the Weave from the Black Rift. Adventurers pursued them through the Dusk Lords Passage to the Shadow Swamp and disrupted their efforts, and found the Black Chronology among their detritus. That same year, a rift to the Shadowfell was opened in the skies over Sembia and the city of Ordulin was destroyed when a shadowy tract of land fell on it.\nIn 1376 DR, eight brave heroes ventured into the Plane of Shadow and defeated one of its guardians, Mordoc SeLanmere, and destroyed the Onyx Heart.\nA major change afflicted the Plane of Shadow in 1385 DR when Shar, having successfully arranged Mystras death, bound the energies of the Negative Energy Plane with the plane.\nAfter the Second Sundering, the Shadowfell no longer was a waypoint for the souls of the dead on their way to the Fugue plane, but it remained known as the Shadowfell for most people.\nAround 1492 DR, Ketheric Thorm, formerly a Chosen of Shar before he changed allegiances and became the Chosen of Myrkul, imprisoned the aasimar Dame Aylin within a soul cage located within the Shadowfell.\nThe special and unique nature of this plane caused not only cosmologists to speculate about its origins, but visitors and planar travelers as well. Some believed the Plane of Shadow had spontaneously formed as a demiplane out of the Ethereal Plane.\nHowever, most cosmologists and planewalkers with a sense of adventure liked to talk about the legend of the Shining Citadel. Briefly, the legend postulated that the Plane of Shadow was once bright and colorful like the Material Plane, but at some point in the distant past a mysterious group who worshiped the planes creator took all of the light, color, and most of the life-force from the rest of the plane and concentrated it into a mighty citadel. One would think that a structure containing most of the energy from an entire plane of existence would be hard to miss, but no one has ever found the Shining Citadel, except perhaps, as the legend states, those who venture into the deepest parts of the Plane of Shadows and never return.\nA theory bandied about among sages stated that the Underdark was bottomless because it eventually became the Plane of Shadow. The only evidence supporting this hypothesis was that permanent portals to the Shadowfell were increasingly common the deeper one delved.\nthumb|right|250px|Exploring the Shadowfell.\n Chaulssin Located almost ten miles (sixteen kilometers) below the surface of northwest Faerûn, beneath the northernmost peak of the Rauvin Mountains, this was originally a drow city that was captured by shadow dragons in the Year of Shambling Shadows, &minus221 DR. Under the influence of shadow dragons for hundreds of years, the city was slowly absorbed by the Plane of Shadow until their overthrow in the Year of the Darkspawn, 634 DR. Abandoned in the Year of the Splendid Stag, 734 DR, the fringe of the Shadowfell continued to ebb and flow through streets and buildings filled with dangerous shadow creatures. Chaulssin was reestablished in the Year of the Shadowkin Return, 1136 DR, by House Jaezred as a base for the shadow dragon&ndashblooded drow assassins.\n Chaulmurssin This city was established on the Plane of Shadow by the inhabitants of Chaulssin after fleeing an advancing army from Menzoberranzan in 734 DR. The Chaulssinyr hastily traveled through dangerous caverns until they found the abandoned lairs of their shadow dragon progenitors and claimed them, eking out an existence. Eventually the city thrived and became a power that demanded respect.\n Evernight The dismal reflection of Neverwinter. It was believed to be the dark version of least one city in every world in the Prime Material plane.\n Gloomwrought A port city.\n Mulsantir Travel between the Shadowfell and the Prime Material Plane was possible in certain places in Mulsantir at certain times of day. Shadow Mulsantir contained a Temple of Myrkul, in the place where a Shrine to Kelemvor stood on the Prime. Within this temple was found a portal leading to Kelemvors domain, the Fugue Plane.\n Shadow Swamp The Vast Swamp between Cormyr and Sembia had a Shadowfell counterpart, called the Shadow Swamp. Although the environment was similar in many ways, it was a great black swamp, where the water was dark and still and only moved sluggishly through the channels. Nevertheless, the landscape was different there seemed to be more water than in the fast-growing Vast Swamp. Sites in the Vast Swamp had echoes here the Lost Refuge in the material world had a counterpart in the so-called Shadow Citadel, which followed the same plan but was even more ruined. A portal called the Dusk Lords Passage linked the two. On the other hand, a flooded fissure that formed an ordinary lakebed in the Vast Swamp was reflected in an empty canyon in the Shadow Swamp, known as the Black Rift. Swamp water flowed in on all sides, yet the water at the bottom never rose and never seemed to drain out, an entirely unexplained phenomena of the plane. The Black Rift was especially morphic—although it remained more-or-less the same shape overall, local changes in terrain were extreme and bizarre. The interplay between the magical Weave and the Shadow Weave was especially malleable, a trait which attracted the followers of Shar.\n Sphur Upra Located nine miles (over fourteen kilometers) below the surface of east Faerûn, between the surface nations of Mulhorand and Murghôm, this city was established on the Shadowfell in  by five gloaming families seeking security and community. After almost 3,500 years, they expanded their city by creating portals to the Material Plane in the Year of the Spitting Viper, 534 DR, and became a major trading post for goods between the two planes.\n Thultanthar (City of Shade) This floating enclave of Netherese origin entered the Plane of Shadow just before Karsuss Folly brought down the empire in Year of Sundered Webs, &minus339 DR. Over the centuries, its population acclimated to the new environment and became known as shades. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, Thultanthar was brought back to the Material Plane and became known as the City of Shade. The inhabitants then began the rebuilding of the Netherese empire.\nOnly three deities were known to have claimed the Plane of Shadow as their home\n*Mask, the Master of all Thieves and Lord of Shadows had a realm on this plane called Shadow Keep. It was made out of shadowstuff and was extremely difficult to see even when standing right next to it.\n*Shar, Mistress of the Night and Lady of Loss, once resided in a high tower called the Palace of Loss. It had no apparent means of entry or exit, but her followers had no trouble gaining access. She sometimes kept prisoners there so she could enjoy their suffering. After the Spellplague, she moved her abode to the Towers of Night and left behind a deep dark hole guarded by evil creatures. This Foundation of Loss exuded palpable grief and was reported to contain a portal to her home in the Towers of Night.\n*Null, draconic god of death, had realms named the Mausoleum of Chronepsis and the Mausoleum of Pain in the Outlands and Carceri, respectively. Parts of these were thought to exist on the Plane of Shadow at the same time.\nthumb|230px|The gates of Barovia, one of the Domains of Dread.\nIn remote corners of the Shadowfell there were demiplanes created by the Dark Powers which served as prisons to trap creatures of extreme evil to serve as sustenance.\nOne such demiplane was the valley of Barovia, ruled by the vampire Strahd von Zarovich, himself a prisoner of the Dark Powers. Passages to Barovia were rumored to exist somewhere in the Misty Forest, based on reports of werewolf attacks and Vistani presence in Daggerford and surrounding areas.\nElminster, the Sage of Shadowdale, had shown himself aware of count Strahd and his mist-filled domain, as well as how to journey to-and-from there somewhat freely. He briefly sent Volothamp Gaddarm to Barovia to explore the valley, although Volo was initially unaware of the dangers.\nthumb|left|250px|The shadar-kai, denizens of the Shadowfell.\nThe Shadowfell was home to a mysterious form of undead called shadows, other \"shadow\" creatures such as the shadow mastiff and shadow dragon, and a race of humanoids known as shades. In addition to those, there were numerous other inhabitants, such as communities of shadar-kai, Shadovar, and dark ones.\nProbably the most dominant race of beings on the Plane of Shadow were the shades&mdashdescendants of ancient Netherese humans who resided on the plane in their floating city for centuries and acquired many abilities from immersion in shadow essence. Malaugryms may have been superior to shades, having the advantage of being shapeshifters and practically immortal unless killed in some fashion but their small numbers, fierce independence, and difficulty in mastering interplanar travel made them much less organized and effective.The Players Guide to Faerûn states on page 165 that the malaugryms are actually native to a small demiplane attached to the Plane of Shadow.\nOther creatures that were either native to the plane or attracted to it included bodaks, ephemera of all kinds, veserabs, liches, shadar-kai,\nShadow demons also inhabited this plane. These fiends were responsible for the creation of the race known as krinth, having interbred with Netherese slaves.\nShadow sea serpents were not native to the Plane of Shadow but were bred there by the Shadovar, crossing warm-blooded carnivorous orcas with vile shadow creatures. These serpents hunted in packs both in the sea and on land.\nEspecially during the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, the Shadowfell became also prominently populated with dead creatures such as ghosts, specters, and other undead who for whatever reason refused to leave the Shadowfell and continue on to the Fugue Plane.\n*Ambergris, dwarf Shadovar cleric of Dumathoin and former member of Cavus Dun.\n*Afafrenfere, human Shadovar monk, former member of Cavus Dun, former member of Brothers of the Gray Mists, and former member of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.\n*Dark Powers, vestiges of ancient dead evil gods that either dwell on the plane or were banished there, and feed on evil creatures that become trapped in the Shadowfell.\n*Drasek Riven, a godling, had his fortress here, where he hid from Rivalen the Nightseer and the archdevil Mephistopheles, both of whom shared a piece of the divine essence Drasek himself had.\n*Draygo Quick, a Netherese lord and powerful warlock.\n* Effron the Twisted, tiefling Shadovar warlock, and former student of Draygo Quick.\n*The Ghost King, a composite being formed from Hephaestus a dracolich Crenshinibon and its seven disembodied liches and the sentience of Yharaskrik, an illithid which had powers over the undead denizens of the Shadowfell.\n*Glorfathel, elf Shadovar wizard and member of Cavus Dun.\n*Herzgo Alegni, tiefling Shadovar warlord, who wielded Charons Claw.\n*Jermander, a tiefling Shadovar warrior and member of Cavus Dun.\n*Parbid, tiefling Shadovar monk, member of Cavus Dun, and the Brothers of the Gray Mists.\n*Parise Ulfbinder, a Netherese lord.\n*Ratsis the Spider Farmer, a human male shade and member of Cavus Dun.\n*The Raven Queen had a divine realm known as the Fortress of Memories here."
