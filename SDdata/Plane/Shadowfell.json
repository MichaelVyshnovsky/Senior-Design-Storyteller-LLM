        "mainbody": "The '''Shadowfell''', also known as the '''Plane of Shadow''', was one of the [[planes of existence]] in various [[Cosmology|cosmological models]]. Its purpose and characteristics evolved as new cosmologies were formulated. Other names for this plane included '''Shadowland''', the '''Demiplane of Shadow''', the '''Shadow Deep''', and simply '''Shadow'''.\n\nIt existed as sort of a counterpart to the [[Feywild]], in the sense that it was a reflection, or \"echo\", of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Unlike the Feywild, it was a bleak, desolate place full of decay and death.\n{{quote|It is the toxic plane of darkness and power.<br />It is the hidden place that hates the light.<br />It is the frontier of worlds unknown.}}",
        "Cosmologies": {
            "Shadowfell in the Great Wheel Model": "According to early versions of the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the Plane of Shadow was considered only a [[demiplane]]. Demiplanes formed out of the proto-matter that ebbed and flowed about the [[Ethereal Plane]], creating a finite plane with its own Border Ethereal whenever a critical mass was achieved. The largest of these was called the Demiplane of Shadow, and was made up of both [[positive energy|positive]] and [[negative energy|negative]] energy in equal measure.{{Cite dragon/213/The Demiplane of Shadow|23}} For those traveling through the Ethereal Plane, the [[Ethereal curtain|\"curtain of vaporous color\"]] for the Demiplane of Shadow was the color silver. Very little was known about the Demiplane of Shadow other than it was a dim and dismal place.\n\nIn later and revised versions of the Great Wheel cosmology, such as the one following the [[Second Sundering]], the Shadowfell was considered a [[parallel plane]], or an \"echo\" of the Material Plane, coexisting with it along with the [[Feywild]].",
            "Shadowfell in the World Tree Model": "{{Quote|There are many worlds, young elf. The Shadow Deep connects them all. It's the one mirror that shapes their many lights.|Melegaunt Tanthul, [[Nightal 24]] [[1371 DR]].}}\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]] model, the Plane of Shadow was seen as an infinite plane that coexisted with the [[Prime Material Plane]]—touching it at all points and having the same basic geography Naturally occurring intermittent portals called vortices appeared between this plane and the Material Plane in seemingly random areas of heavy shade or darkness. The entry and exit point of a vortex were unpredictable as was their duration, lasting a few days at most.—before stepping back into the Prime, but arriving at a particular destination was much less precise than before. Intrepid travelers could still reach other universes by traversing the Shadowfell and locating the border with an alien world such as [[Oerth]] for example.",

The [[Elemental Plane|Elemental and Energy Planes]] collapsed into the [[Elemental Chaos]] but not before Shar managed to manipulate some of the necrotic energies from the [[Negative Energy Plane]] and inject it into the Plane of Shadow."

        "Description": {
            "Phenomena": "[[File:Shadowfellsummoning.png|thumb|273x273px|A creature of the Shadowfell summoned to the mortal realm.]]\nKnown as \"[[shadowstuff]]\", the material of the Shadowfell could be manipulated by [[illusionist]]s to form semi-real monsters and quasi-real [[evocation]]s that were still effective (to a lesser degree) even if the target successfully disbelieved the illusion.\n\nAnother tool of illusionists was the ''[[shadow well]]'' spell, which could turn a creature's shadow into a temporary gateway into the Shadowfell. If successful, the victim was sucked into the Shadowfell through his or her shadow and spent a few moments in a pocket realm (a very tiny [[demiplane]] attached to the Shadowfell) being terrorized by dark phantasms. No physical harm resulted from this spell, but mental and emotional trauma resulting in a fear response was possible.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to build a gate to the Shadowfell could result in what was termed a [[failed Shadow Gate]]. A being that stepped through one was taken only momentarily to the Plane of Shadow, but in that moment a \"seed of shadow\" was implanted in their flesh. This could cause their flesh to be subsumed by shadow, and they would see it mist away into darkness. Many died, reduced to bare skeletons, but those who survived acquired the powers of a [[dark creature]]."

        "History": "The earliest known conscious interaction of the peoples of [[Toril]] with the Plane of Shadow was in the time of the [[Imaskari]] empire. In the Late period, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-3500}}, the archwizard [[Madryoch the Ebon Flame]] was focused on researching the secrets of the Shadowfell and plotted to use its dark power to overthrow Lord Artificer [[Omanond]]. His plans were thwarted by a young adept named [[Hilather]]. Knowledge of the existence of the Plane of Shadow was presumably lost with the fall of the Imaskari empire because it was some three thousand years later, in the [[-533 DR|Year of Plentiful Wine, &minus;533 DR]], that the [[Netherese]] rediscovered it and began their study.\n\nIn [[1235 DR]], the [[Black Horde]] attacked Faerûn. The Horde defeated [[Eldrith the Betrayer]], who would go on to betray [[Baldur's Gate]]. They killed her and she was reborn out of hatred. In her soul of hatred, the [[Onyx Tower]] was created and tied to her life. The [[Onyx Heart]] was located in the Plane of Shadow and only with its destruction could the Onyx Tower be destroyed.\n\nAn [[Drogan Droganson's pupil|adventurer]] and their companions were exploring the ruined [[Netherese]] city of [[Undrentide]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. In an [[Arcanist's Tower]], they slipped through portals into its dark reflection on the Shadowfell, where they encountered [[shade]]s. The adventurer later escaped impending doom by traveling back to the Plane of Shadow using a magic mirror.\n\nAlthough the souls of the dead did not begin to be drawn to the Shadow Plane until after the [[Spellplague]] and [[Shar]] transformed it into the Shadowfell, it was possible to trap a soul there. Notably, this happened to a king of [[Damara]], [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], in the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], by a cabal of wizards allied to the [[lich]] [[Sammaster]]. King Gareth's soul was rescued in the following year by a phalanx of [[paladin]]s led by the [[smoke drake]] [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]].\n\nIn the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], [[Shar]]ran and [[Cyric]]ist cultists based in the [[Shadow Swamp]] on the Plane of Shadow, plotted to tear apart the [[Weave]] from the [[Black Rift]]. Adventurers pursued them through the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] to the Shadow Swamp and disrupted their efforts, and found the [[Black Chronology]] among their detritus. That same year, a rift to the Shadowfell was opened in the skies over [[Sembia]] and the city of [[Ordulin]] was destroyed when a shadowy tract of land fell on it.\n\nIn [[1376 DR]], eight brave heroes ventured into the Plane of Shadow and defeated one of its guardians, [[Mordoc SeLanmere]], and destroyed the [[Onyx Heart]].\n\nA major change afflicted the Plane of Shadow in [[1385 DR]] when [[Shar]], having successfully arranged [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]'s death, bound the energies of the [[Negative Energy Plane]] with the plane.\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], the Shadowfell no longer was a waypoint for the souls of the dead on their way to the Fugue plane, but it remained known as the Shadowfell for most people.\n\nAround 1492 DR, [[Ketheric Thorm]], formerly a Chosen of Shar before he changed allegiances and became the Chosen of Myrkul, imprisoned the [[aasimar]] Dame [[Aylin]] within a soul cage located within the Shadowfell.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "The special and unique nature of this plane caused not only cosmologists to speculate about its origins, but visitors and planar travelers as well. Some believed the Plane of Shadow had spontaneously formed as a [[demiplane]] out of the [[Ethereal Plane]].\n\nHowever, most cosmologists and planewalkers with a sense of adventure liked to talk about the legend of the Shining Citadel. Briefly, the legend postulated that the Plane of Shadow was once bright and colorful like the Material Plane, but at some point in the distant past a mysterious group who worshiped the plane's creator took all of the light, color, and most of the life-force from the rest of the plane and concentrated it into a mighty citadel. One would think that a structure containing most of the energy from an entire [[plane of existence]] would be hard to miss, but no one has ever found the Shining Citadel, except perhaps, as the legend states, those who venture into the deepest parts of the Plane of Shadows and never return.\n\nA theory bandied about among sages stated that the [[Underdark]] was bottomless because it eventually became the Plane of Shadow. The only evidence supporting this hypothesis was that permanent ''portals'' to the Shadowfell were increasingly common the deeper one delved.",

            "Realms": "Only three [[deities]] were known to have claimed the Plane of Shadow as their home:\n\n*[[Mask]], the Master of all Thieves and Lord of Shadows had a realm on this plane called [[Shadow Keep]]. It was made out of shadowstuff and was extremely difficult to see even when standing right next to it.\n*[[Shar]], Mistress of the Night and Lady of Loss, once resided in a high tower called the [[Palace of Loss]]. It had no apparent means of entry or exit, but her followers had no trouble gaining access. She sometimes kept prisoners there so she could enjoy their suffering. After the [[Spellplague]], she moved her abode to the [[Towers of Night]] and left behind a deep dark hole guarded by evil creatures. This [[Foundation of Loss]] exuded palpable grief and was reported to contain a portal to her home in the Towers of Night.\n*[[Null]], [[Draconic pantheon|draconic god]] of death, had realms named the [[Mausoleum of Chronepsis]] and the [[Mausoleum of Pain]] in the [[Outlands]] and [[Carceri]], respectively. Parts of these were thought to exist on the Plane of Shadow at the same time.<ref>",
            "Domains of Dread": "[[File:Gates_of_barovia.jpg|thumb|230px|''The gates of Barovia, one of the Domains of Dread.'']]\n{{Main|Domains of Dread}}\n\nIn remote corners of the Shadowfell there were [[demiplane]]s created by the [[Dark Powers]] which served as prisons to trap creatures of extreme evil to serve as sustenance.\n\nOne such demiplane was the valley of [[Barovia]], ruled by the [[vampire]] [[Strahd von Zarovich]], himself a prisoner of the Dark Powers. Passages to Barovia were rumored to exist somewhere in the [[Misty Forest]], based on reports of [[werewolf]] attacks and [[Vistani]] presence in [[Daggerford]] and surrounding areas.\n\n[[Elminster |Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale]], had shown himself aware of count Strahd and his mist-filled domain, as well as how to journey to-and-from there somewhat freely. He briefly sent [[volo|Volothamp Gaddarm]] to Barovia to explore the valley, although Volo was initially unaware of the dangers.{{Cite dragon+/6/Travel Talk: Volo's Visit to Barovia}}"
