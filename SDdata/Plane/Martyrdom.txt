'''Martyrdom''', also known as '''Martyrdomain''', was the [[divine realm]] of the deity [[Ilmater]], the Broken God.

==Location==
Under the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Martyrdomain was located on the layer of [[Shurrock]] in the [[Twin Paradises|Twin Paradises of Bytopia]].

However, following the breaking of the Triad in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, Ilmater moved his domain out of the House of the Triad. At [[Sune]]'s invitation, he relocated it to [[Brightwater]] on the World Tree. By [[1479 DR]], Ilmater had reestablished Martyrdom on its mountain in Celestia, now under the [[World Axis cosmology]].

==Description==
Martyrdom stood atop the summit of a lesser peak of Celestia, and its domain included the mountain itself. At its heart lay a great open-air temple built of rows of pillars of white stone.

It was a tranquil place, full of comfort and rest, and known by [[planes]]walkers as one of the  most relaxing in the cosmos. No creature within Martyrdom could feel any pain or weariness, nor any kind of suffering.

==Inhabitants==
The realm was inhabited by the petitioners of Ilmater, the spirits of his deceased faithful, many of whom had died as martyrs. Here they were rewarded and granted peace for their suffering and perseverance in life.

==Features==
Following Tyr's departure from the Triad and [[Abeir-Toril]] in 1384 DR, his sword ''[[Justicar (sword)|Justicar]]'' was kept within Martyrdom. At the center of the temple was a  white stone plinth from which the [[sword]] protruded. Carved into the plinth were the words "Justice endures" and a stylized depiction of a scale.

One important part of Ilmater's realm was the [[Weeping Garden]], his private garden and a place of relief and aid for his most dedicated followers. According to unsubstantiated legend, on very rare occasions, the gates out of the garden did not return guests to their original location but cleared of mists and led out into other parts of the  House of the Triad.
