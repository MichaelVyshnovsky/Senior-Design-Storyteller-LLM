The Silver Safehold was a demiplane created by Khelben Arunsun and the Sword Heralds.
All portals located within the Silver Safehold led back to Faer√ªn.
The Tel Teukiira, who were also called the Moonstars, used the Silver Safehold as a secure base of operations. Access to the Silver Safehold was granted through the use of special Teukiir badges.
