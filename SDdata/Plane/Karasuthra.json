        "mainbody": "'''Karasuthra''' was the third and deepest layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]]. A realm of perpetual night and home to dangerous predators,",
        "Description": "The dominant celestial body in the layer was the moon [[Noctos]], which absorbed the light that emanated from the plane's sun [[Selera]] and reflected part of it off its surface, providing the layer with a very dim silver moonlight. Noctos's phase changed extremely slowly. Light sources such as [[torch]]es, fires, and magical light were also considerably weakened while in the layer, giving off only about half of their nominal light and heat for only half of the normal duration. Nonmagical light only worked if brought from outside of the layers, and no new nonmagical light could be initiated there.\n\nLike the rest of the Beastlands, this layer had no settlements.",
        "Cosmography": "Rumors existed of connections between Karasuthra and the [[Shadowfell]]. [[Shadow creature (template)|Shadow creature]]s were occasionally found in the layer, usually hiding from predators.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Stormhold]], realm of [[Stronmaus]].\n\n* The [[Labyrinth of Fiery Doom]], a detached fragment of [[Phlegethos]] rumored to be the lair of a couple of lovers: a [[red dragon]] and a [[succubus]]. Their true identities were known to almost no one. The red dragon was in fact the [[agathinon]] [[Janarr]], while the succubus was in fact the [[erinyes]] [[Nalura]]. They had fallen in love with each other before realizing they were supposed to be enemies, and decided to adopt their disguises in order to hide from their pursuing hierarchies. By the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], the couple was expecting their first child.\n\n* The [[Ice Plain]], realm of [[Rellavar Danuvien]], the Frost Sprite King of the [[Seldarine]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited}}",
        "Inhabitants": "The layer's main natives were the [[mortai]], who were present in the skies of the entire plane. A permanent contingent of at least one mortai was always present near Stormhold.\n\nLike the rest of the plane, Karasuthra was inhabited primarily by natural [[beast]]s. The layer's most frequent inhabitants were noctunal animals such as [[owl]]s and [[panther]]s. Despite the perpetual night, the layer had an extensive vegetation that provided food and cover for a variety of herbivore animals as well."
