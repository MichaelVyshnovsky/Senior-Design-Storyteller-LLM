'''Brassberg''' was one of the [[divine realm]]s of the [[Draconic pantheon|draconic deity]] [[Hlal|Hlal the Jester]], who was usually known as [[Aasterinian]] in the [[Outer Planes]].

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Brassberg was Hlal's lair deep within [[Ysgard]]'s third layer, [[Nidavellir]] (her other realm was a secret lair in [[Arborea]]).<ref group="note">The 3rd-edition Core book ''[[Races of the Dragon]]'', still using the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], treated Hlal and Aasterinian as distinct entities and placed the former in [[Arborea]], the latter in the [[Outlands]].

In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the realm covered part of the lower slopes of the great [[Dragon Eyrie]].<ref group="note">Hlal's realm was not named in the ''[[Player's Guide to Faer√ªn]]''. This article assumes that it is the same as Brassberg.

==Description==
The lair of Hlal consisted of a number of caverns, with just the space to contain the riches collected by the dragon goddess. The surrounding area was dry and warm, as befitted the patron of [[Brass dragon|brass]] and [[copper dragon]]s.

==Features==
A portal linked Brassberg to [[Erevan Ilesere]]'s realm on the plane of [[Arvandor]].
