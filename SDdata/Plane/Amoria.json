        "Description": "The layer had an extremely mild climate, with only modest differences between seasons. Its rolling meadows and woodlands hosted an enormous variety of wildlife and birds. All colors and sounds appeared deeper and more intense.",
        "Cosmography": "Most of the layer's towns were located along the banks of the [[Oceanus]], which was intensively used as a route of transportation and trade. Amoria was the last layer visited by the river before it continued on to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].\n\n[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash, extended its branches to this layer, as well as all other layers of Elysium, except [[Belierin]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[City of the Star]], realm of [[Ishtar]].\n* The [[Healing Glade]], realm of [[Naralis Analor]], the elven Watcher of Souls.{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited}}\n* [[Principality]], a heavily populated divine realm of nature and peace that was not claimed by any [[deity]].\n* [[Quietude]], realm of [[Isis]].\n* [[Ro Stau]], realm of [[Seker]], appeared as a grandiose high-columned palace of marble surrounded by desert when it manifested here.<ref>\n* [[Succor (realm)|Succor]], realm of [[Hathor]]\n* [[Tethridar]], combined realm of [[Seldarine]] members [[Kirith Sotheril]], the Magess, and [[Tethrin Verald√©]], the Master of Blades.",
        "Inhabitants": "The layer was inhabited by the leaders of the [[guardinal]]s, who used the layer as a base from which to direct their forces against evil, including sending rescue missions to the [[Lower planes]] to recover captives of evil beings."
