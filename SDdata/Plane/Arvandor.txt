'''Arvandor''' was a realm in the [[Arvandor (layer)|first layer]] of the [[Outer plane]] of [[Arborea]], according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. It was the home and shared [[divine realm]] of most of the [[Seldarine]]. In the [[World Axis cosmology]], it was considered an [[astral dominion]] and also the primary home of the [[Lords of the Golden Hills]].

==Geography==
Arvandor was a vast, infinite expanse of pristine wilderness covered in lush forests, massive mountains, perfectly clear streams, placid lakes, and an ocean called the [[Sparkling Sea]]. The realm stretched from the boundless mass of the Sparkling Sea to a range of snow-capped mountains.

The deep woods of Arvandor possessed an unearthly beauty, which not only exemplified its home plane of Arborea, but also influenced it, as the long-term presence of [[elf|elves]] in the plane had also somewhat changed it. The realm was full of secrets and mysteries that were known only to the elven deities.

The thick canopy of the forests was divided in layers in many locations: an upper layer of sun-loving trees and a lower layer of shade-favoring vegetation. In some of the thicker forest areas, the undergrowth was nearly impenetrable, due to a combination of dense foliage and the trunks of dead trees. Those areas were dangerous and generally avoided by elves.

The darkness of the forests was offset by the brightness of the meadows in Arvandor. They were characterized either by their perennial flowers or by the blue blossoms that grew above the snow during spring.

The otherworldly beauty and passion of Arvandor could be overwhelming to non-elves. Those that could not resist it were overtaken by an irresistible desire to dance and commune with the elves, and had to be guided away, otherwise risking becoming lost forever. Not even [[half-elf|half-elves]] were immune to this effect.

Each one of the elven patron deities maintained a realm on this plane. None of these realms had a border and each one seamlessly melded into the other with absolutely no discernible borders apparent. While each deity claimed a portion of the realm, the majority was shared by the entire pantheon and with the [[celestial eladrin]].

Arvandor was also the destination of the souls of the elven dead, although sometimes it was called by a distinct name of '''Arvanaith'''.

===Links===
Several connections existed between Arvandor and other planes, either naturally occurring or kept by different deities and inhabitants.

* A ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Heartfire Quarter]], [[Sune]]'s realm in [[Brightwater]], was kept by [[Hanali Celanil]].
* A ''portal'' to the realm of [[Hlal]] in the lower reaches of [[Dragon Eyrie]] was kept by [[Erevan Ilesere]].
* A ''portal'' to the [[House of Nature]] at the shore of the Sparkling Sea was maintained by a collective effort of both the Seldarine and all deities who had realms in the House of Nature.
* A ''portal'' to the [[Gates of the Moon]] was maintained by celestial eladrin who resided on both sides.
* The [[Ingmar Brook]], a tributary of the [[Silverflow River]], also functioned as a ''portal'' to the realm of [[Alfheim]] in [[Ysgard (layer)|Ysgard]].
*Arvandor's portal to the [[Outlands]] [[gate-town]] of Sylvania was located just outside of Lolth's grove.<ref># [[Wolfgang Baur]] and [[Lester Smith]] (1994-07-01). “The Book of Chaos”. In [[Michele Carter]] ed. ''[[Planes of Chaos (boxed set)|Planes of Chaos]]'' ([[TSR, Inc]]), pp. 41–42. ISBN [[Special:BookSources/1560768746|1560768746]].

==Government==
The deities of the Seldarine had little interest in governing the realm. They instead ruled through [[proxy|proxies]] that in turn sent emissaries to enforce the laws. These duties were taken with varying degrees of seriousness.

The elven population was ruled by High Kings and Queens. There was typically one ruler for each elven subrace.

==Trade==
The small elven settlements in Arvandor produced goods of the finest quality. They were famous for their sweet trail [[ration]]s, as well as their [[mead]] and venison. The musical instruments produced in Arvandor were clear-sounding, and the cloaks and boots produced in the realm were extremely durable. Metalcraft in the realm was also of extremely high quality, comparable to [[dwarf|dwarven]] standards, although availability of [[armor]] was limited to [[chainmail]] or other simple armor. Weapons produced in Arvandor were exceptional, in particular [[spear]]s and [[bow]]s, but were very costly.

==Defenses==
Some of the ''portals'' that led into Arvandor from other planes were the focus of hostile invading creatures. The realm also was frequently attacked by raiding parties from the [[Unseelie Court]], seeking to capture slaves at the command of the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]]. These attackers were repelled by knights and guards among the plane's [[petitioner]]s, but they brought the winds of [[Pandemonium]] with them, provoking violent winds whenever they arrived or departed the realm.

==History==
Arvandor was conquered by the Seldarine from the [[giant pantheon|giant deities]], as evidenced by the numerous ruins of [[giant]] architecture scattered through the glades and meadows of the realm.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that Alfheim had once been a part of Arvandor, but gradually slid into Ysgard as its inhabitants began prioritizing honor and survival.

[[Labelas Enoreth]] was known to stay in Arvandor, but  the location of his realm was a mystery. According to one rumor it was a tower that only could be glimpsed as an ominous sign (or sign for the emerging of new elven leader). According to another it was below one of Arvandor's mighty hills.

;[[Aerie (realm)|Aerie]]:
:The divine realm of [[Aerdrie Faenya]] and [[Syranita]]. Located at the boundary between Arborea and Ysgard, it randomly shifted between Arvandor and Alfheim. It was an archipelago of floating islands, floating trees with two crowns, and a glittering palace of clouds that floated above the clear skies of both layers.

;[[Crescent Grove]]:
:Also known as "Gwyllachaightaeryll", meaning "the Many-Splendored" in the [[Elven language]], the great palace was the center of Arvandor and home to [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Sehanine Moonbow]]. Originally a giant tower, the palace was an ever-changing blend of nature and art, combining an architecture of white [[marble]] pillars and walkways with enormous white-barked trees. At the center stood the Overlook, the palace's tallest tower, which offered a breathtaking view of the entire realm and was a favorite destination for visitors. Many petitioners of Arvandor spent their time here, reflecting in quiet contemplation and enjoying some undisturbed solitude.

;[[Elavandor]]:
:This palace, built of [[coral]], [[gold]], and veined marble at the bottom of a chasm in the Sparkling Sea, was the home of the Dolphin Prince, [[Deep Sashelas]]. It was home to celestial [[dolphin]]s, [[whale]]s, and great schools of fish. Populations of [[triton]]s also shared the realm with the realm's [[sea elf]] petitioners.

;[[Erevan's changing palace]]
:When the trickster [[Erevan Ilesere]] stayed in Arvandor between his exploits it was in a palace made from different materials. Its details changed according to the deity's whims and were never the same twice for any visitor. The palace held much of Erevan's treasures, ready for the taking of an enterprising soul - if they could prevail against the multitude of traps set to test the skill of any intruder.<ref>

;[[The Gnarl]]:
:A village of elves and [[ratatosk]] near one of the roots of an immense tree, which was interpreted as [[Yggdrasil]] in the Great Wheel model and as the [[World Tree]] in the World Tree model. The village neighbored Erevan Ilesere's realm.

;[[Hanali Celanil's Crystal Palace]]
:The  [[Hanali Celanil|elven goddess of love and beauty]] resided in a magnificent structure of pure crystal within a [[Evergold#The Lake of Evergold|lake]].

[[Dragon magazine 236]] places them into [[Elysium]] instead, but is the only source that names their realm. This article assumes that their realm in Arvandor also has this name.

;[[Golden Hills]]:
:The realm of the [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnomish pantheon]] was considered a part of Arvandor in the World Axis cosmology.

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Elf_in_arvandor-2e.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''An elf reveling in the deep woods of Arvandor.'']]
The realm was inhabited by all types of elves, including [[fey eladrin]] and even a few [[drow]]. The native elven inhabitants of Arvandor differed from elves from other planes by the intensity of their passions. All emotions ran stronger there, and were also more fickle.

Arvandor and the Gates of the Moon were the divine realms with the largest populations of celestial eladrin. Although not servants of the Seldarine, the eladrin respected and generally cooperated with them in both everyday and urgent matters. However, when an elven deity required a more powerful representative to travel to another plane, an angel was usually called upon, rather than an eladrin. For that reason, a multitude of angels made their home there.

The several canopy layers teemed with wildlife, such as [[giant squirrel]]s and [[bat]]s. They were home to tribes of [[aarakocra]] and elves who never set foot on the ground, considered impure by some of the elven tribes. The dangerous undergrowth in the thickest areas of the forests was home to [[ettercap]]s, [[shadow]]s, and spiders.

Hunting was a common practice among the inhabitants of Arvandor. They were typically held during elven holidays, and the quarry was always meant to be eaten during feasts, since the hunts were meant for more than sport. On rare occasions, a High King or Queen ordered a special hunt for a larger or more dangerous creature, usually a monster that wandered into the realm from neighboring [[Olympus]] or a rogue beast. Despite the celebratory character of these events, they were taken seriously by the population. Failure to catch an intended quarry was usually seen as a bad omen.

===Petitioners===
All petitioners of Arvandor, whether they were elves in their mortal lives or not, acquired an exaggerated elven appearance upon arrival at Arvandor. These petitioners spent their time enjoying the eternal tranquility of the plane.
