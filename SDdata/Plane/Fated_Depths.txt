'''Fated Depths''' was a [[Fiendish Plane]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]] model.This speculation is based on the fact that the [[Elemental Planes]] all collapsed into the [[Elemental Chaos]] and this plane is essentially an evil version of the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].

==Description==
Similar to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], Fated Depths was a bottomless ocean without a surface. Unlike the [[Elemental Plane of Water|plane of water]], Fated Depths was under crushing pressure, briny, and produced no light&mdash;the only light sources were those belonging to the inhabitants. The waters were fouled with the effluent of the [[River of Blood]] to such an extent that it was effectively unholy water, capable of injuring any [[celestial]] being that came in contact with it.

This plane had many connections to the Elemental Plane of Water and the water-dominant layers of the [[Abyss]]. A ''portal'' also existed between Fated Depths and [[Fury's Heart]], home of [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen. The usual [[Astral Plane]] methods of travel were possible, and the vomiting mouth of the River of Blood provided access to nearly all the other fiendish planes.

==Inhabitants==
Fated Depths was the typical [[afterlife]] destination for [[kuo-toa]]n and [[sahuagin]] [[petitioner]]s&mdash;they appeared in death just as they did in life. With many connections to the Abyss, there were an unusually large number of [[half-fiend]], half-sahaugin swimming in this plane. Demonic hybrids of kuo-toa were not uncommon either. Other inhabitants included such [[demon]]s and [[yugoloth]]s as [[myrmyxicus]]es, [[skulvyn]], [[piscoloth]]s, and [[wastrilith]]s, plus more natural creatures such as [[dire shark]]s, [[giant squid]], [[octopus]]es, and [[kraken]]. Occasionally [[styx dragon]]s would leave the Blood River and be seen on this plane.

==Realms==
* [[Blibdoolpoolp]] had a realm on this plane that was a moon-sized spherical temple that drifted through the murk, populated mainly by kuo-toan petitioners tending fiendish crustaceans and shellfish.
* [[Sekolah]], the shark god of the sahuagin, prowled this plane with no particular demesne&mdash;his presence was the center of his realm, always moving through the brackish depths.
