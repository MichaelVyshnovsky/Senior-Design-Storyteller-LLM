        "mainbody": "he House of the Triad was one of the celestial planes of the World Tree cosmology. A plane that exemplified the rule of law upholding the principles of good, it contained the realms of Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr, as well as Helm and Siamorphe.\nThe planes main feature was the great mountain Celestia, which was surrounded by three smaller mountains, each of which hosting the realms of Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr. The realm of Siamorphe was located in a valley between Celestia and Tyrs realm, while Helms realm had no fixed position in the plane.\nIn general, the House of the Triad was a resplendent plane that shone with heavenly radiance, marked by bright palaces with majestic marble halls.\nThe House of the Triad was connected to the lower branches of the World Tree, but there were no known portals that led to or from the plane. The central mountain, Celestia, was considered a divine realm in itself and was described to be identical to its Great-Wheel counterpart, although no deities resided there according to the World Tree cosmology.\nThe plane was inhabited by archons and archon paragons that lived in the plane and served Ilmater, Torm, or Tyr. Many archons lived on the surrounding mountains and served their deities directly, but the enormous central mountain, Celestia, was home to most of them. Archons that lived on Celestia were ruled by Zaphkiel, but also seemed to serve the various deities in the plane. The mountains were also inhabited by angels, who served the Triad, and took on the bulk of the missions to other planes. In addition, the plane was home to formians who occasionally served Helm and Siamorphe, but usually led their orderly lives undisturbed by divine interference.\nThe House of the Triad was also home to battle dragons and radiant dragons, who were not uncommonly seen throughout the plane.\nMost of the planes petitioners were lantern archons who were not committed to the plane and were free to leave it at will. Petitioners who tended more strongly towards neutrality, as well as followers of Helm or Siamorphe, retained the forms they had in life, but with the benefits of immunity to electrical attacks and petrification, as well as a greater resistance against physical attacks than they had in life.\nMartyrdom Realm of Ilmater, the Crying god, and one of the three mountains surrounding Celestia. The mountain held at its center a great open-air temple where the souls of the petitioners were rewarded for their endurance and perseverance in life. No one could feel pain or fatigue there. Ilmaters realm was known as a place of comfort and rest and one of the most soothing places in the Outer Planes.\nTrueheart Realm of Torm, the True Deity, and also one of the mountains surrounding Celestia. Torms palace, located in the heart of the realm, resembled a huge military fortress, with walls of mithral, battlements of diamond, and gates of adamantine. It was guarded by legions of angels and archons serving the cause of good and law, in particular holding vigil against Bane.\nThe Court Realm of Tyr, the Just God, and the third mountain surrounding Celestia. The marble hall at the center of the realm resembled a court of law and served as a meeting place where the Triad frequently consulted. No one could lie or bluff there.\nEverwatch Realm of Helm, the Vigilant One, a floating watchtower that roamed the plane. Whenever a visitor arrived to the plane via portal or color pool, Everwatch would always be present at the arriving location. The watchtower was always staffed with a guardian covered in a suit of mithral full plate armor, who received the visitors, detected their alignment and purposes. and could call heavenly defenders in the event of an invasion.\nAlabaster Palace Realm of Siamorphe, located in a beautiful valley between the Court and Celestia. The palace was surrounded by perfect gardens and fountains and was populated by peacocks whose sounds permeated the valley."
