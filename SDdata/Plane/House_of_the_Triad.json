        "mainbody": "The '''House of the Triad''' was one of the [[celestial planes]] of the [[World Tree cosmology]]. A plane that exemplified the rule of law upholding the principles of good, it contained the realms of [[Ilmater]], [[Torm]], and [[Tyr]], as well as [[Helm]] and [[Siamorphe]].",
        "Description": "The plane's main feature was the great mountain [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]], which was surrounded by three smaller mountains, each of which hosting the realms of Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr. The realm of Siamorphe was located in a valley between Celestia and Tyr's realm, while Helm's realm had no fixed position in the plane.\n\nIn general, the House of the Triad was a resplendent plane that shone with heavenly radiance, marked by bright palaces with majestic marble halls.",
        "Cosmography": "The House of the Triad was connected to the lower branches of the [[World Tree]], but there were no known ''[[portal]]s'' that led to or from the plane. The central mountain, Celestia, was considered a divine realm in itself and was described to be identical to its [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great-Wheel]] counterpart, although no deities resided there according to the World Tree cosmology.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Petitioners": "Most of the plane's petitioners were [[lantern archon]]s who were not committed to the plane and were free to leave it at will. Petitioners who tended more strongly towards [[neutral]]ity, as well as followers of Helm or Siamorphe, retained the forms they had in life, but with the benefits of immunity to electrical attacks and [[petrification]], as well as a greater resistance against physical attacks than they had in life."
        },
        "Divine Realms": {
            "Martyrdom": "Realm of [[Ilmater]], the Crying god, and one of the three mountains surrounding Celestia. The mountain held at its center a great open-air temple where the souls of the petitioners were rewarded for their endurance and perseverance in life. No one could feel pain or fatigue there. Ilmater's realm was known as a place of comfort and rest and one of the most soothing places in the [[Outer Planes]].",
            "Trueheart": "Realm of [[Torm]], the True Deity, and also one of the mountains surrounding Celestia. Torm's palace, located in the heart of the realm, resembled a huge military fortress, with walls of [[mithral]], battlements of [[diamond]], and gates of [[adamantine]]. It was guarded by legions of angels and archons serving the cause of good and law, in particular holding vigil against [[Bane]].",
            "The Court": "Realm of [[Tyr]], the Just God, and the third mountain surrounding Celestia. The marble hall at the center of the realm resembled a court of law and served as a meeting place where the Triad frequently consulted. No one could lie or bluff there.",
            "Everwatch": "Realm of [[Helm]], the Vigilant One, a floating watchtower that roamed the plane. Whenever a visitor arrived to the plane via ''portal'' or [[color pool]], Everwatch would always be present at the arriving location. The watchtower was always staffed with a guardian covered in a suit of mithral [[full plate]] armor, who received the visitors, detected their alignment and purposes. and could call heavenly defenders in the event of an invasion.",
            "Alabaster Palace": "Realm of [[Siamorphe]], located in a beautiful valley between the Court and Celestia. The palace was surrounded by perfect gardens and fountains and was populated by [[peacock]]s whose sounds permeated the valley."
