'''Memphiria''' was the [[divine domain]] of the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic]] and [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity]] of death, [[Osiris]].

==Cosmology==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Memphiria was one of the three triangular divine realms that made up [[Heliopolis]]. Under the [[World Tree cosmology]], it was likewise part of Heliopolis, which in that cosmology was a [[Neutral Planes|neutral plane]] that was shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.
===Planar Traits===
In the Great Wheel cosmology, [[undead]] were deprived of their special innate abilities while in Memphiria. For example, the [[mummies]] of this realm did not produce [[mummy rot]].

==Geography==
In both cosmologies Memphiria was a desert realm,

==Notable Locations==
* '''Memphiria''': A residential city built of white [[marble]], which was rather lacking in terms of goods and services. In the World Tree cosmology, it was said to be a grand necropolis surrounded by rows of mausoleums.

==Inhabitants==
In the Great Wheel cosmology, this divine realm was also primarily inhabited by petitioners. They moved slowly about their business and weren't as lively as the petitioners elsewhere in Heliopolis, but were still largely content with their lot in life. Underground, the spirits of kings who ruled wisely in life ruled over the spirits that had served them in life.

Beyond petitioners, his realm in the Great Wheel was inhabited by mummies (though they were not [[evil]]) and a variety of other undead creatures that were not of evil [[alignment]]. The mummies of this realm would rise up to seek vengeance upon those who despoiled their graves, while other undead came to the realm in order to complete some form of quest or out of a desire to reclaim some semblance of a normal, mortal life. The petitioners of this realm treated the undead no different from the living, through they would fearlessly attack any undead that was evil.

In the World Tree cosmology, his realm was said to be inhabited solely by petitioners of [[Mulhorandi]] origin, though these petitioners were all non-evil corporeal forms of undead.
===Notable Inhabitants===
* '''Khallis Mhektis''': The fair, wise, and impartial [[half-elf]] [[proxy]] of Osiris who ruled over the city of Memphiria. They had a sorrowful look to them and their only motivation was to serve Osiris well.
