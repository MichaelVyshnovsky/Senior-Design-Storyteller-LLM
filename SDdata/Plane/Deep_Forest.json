        "mainbody": "The Deep Forest, sometimes called Summeroak, was the divine realm of Silvanus.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, this realm was located within the larger realm of Tir na Og in the Outlands. According to the World Tree cosmology, the realm was located in the House of Nature. And the World Axis cosmology placed this realm in the Deep Wilds.\nThe Deep Forest was home to the greatest of all trees. It was a realm of thick and feral vegetation, as well as a rich and diverse wildlife. Dense and majestic canopies almost entirely blocked sunlight from reaching the ground below.\nThe entire place was claimed by nature. There were no artificial buildings anywhere in the Deep Forest.\nSilvanus was said to make his home at the heart of the Deep Forest, in a glen that was also referred to as Summeroak."
