'''Spirac''' was the 71{{st}} [[Layers of the Abyss|layer of the]] [[Abyss]]. It was an uncivilized place with no ruler.<ref><ref>

==Description==
Spirac was a wild land of deep forests of spiky ferns and thin, towering mountains. It was impossible to build anything on the layer, and all attempts crumbled into weed-covered ruins and then natural rock within months of their creation.

==Notable Locations==
A mountain pool located near the presumed geographical center of the layer was said to rejuvenate any mortal who bathed in it by 10 to 40 years.

==Inhabitants==
Spirac was home to a staggering variety of of unusual animals and magical beasts. Many [[demon lord]]s used Spirac as their personal hunting grounds, and would take offense when they ran into any "intruders"; despite this, hunters flocked to the layer to hunt [[yeth hound]]s, [[vorr]]s, [[nightmare beast]]s, and much worse. Cannier hunters would bring lesser [[demon]]s such as [[abyssal skulker]]s and [[jarilith]]s to aid them.

Additional, many mortals came to the layer, drawn by the legends of the rejuvenating pool that lay at its center, although most ended up as prey in the bags of hunting fiends. However, those who reached the pool, supposedly, had to sacrifice a portion of their free will to the [[demon lord]] [[Soneillon]], called the Youthful Crone, who lived within its depths.<ref>

==History==
Long ago, as the [[obyrith]]s fell and the [[tanar'ri]] rose in power, an alliance of seven demon lords hunted the obyrith lord called [[the Malgoth]] on the fields of Spirac.<ref> In much more recent times, the demon lord [[Mastiphal]] won [[Malcanthet]]'s favor by presenting her with the head of a huge [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[smilodon]] that he'd killed in Spirac.<ref>
