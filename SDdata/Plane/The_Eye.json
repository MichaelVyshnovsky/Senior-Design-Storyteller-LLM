        "Cosmography and Description": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the Eye lay on [[Arcadia]]'s second layer, Buxenus.\n\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]], it was part of the magical [[celestial plane]] of [[Dweomerheart]]. It was located below [[Mystra]]'s city of Dweomerheart and adjacent to the [[Azuth (realm)|realm of Azuth]]. Like the latter, it consisted of a number of caverns, though it was smaller in scope. Rumor had it that the thoughts of Savras, and thus knowledge about present, past, and future, echoed through these caves, though only a very strong mind might gather useful information. The atmosphere was not unlike that in [[Ilsensine]]'s [[Caverns of Thought]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[petitioner]]s of Savras, many of them having been [[diviner]]s, retained some magical power. Magic-seeking [[mercane]] could be found here, as well as [[inevitable]]s and [[angel]]s serving the All-Seeing One."
