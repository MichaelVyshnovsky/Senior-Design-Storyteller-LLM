        "mainbody": "The '''City of Judgment''', formerly known as the '''City of the Dead''' and the '''City of Strife''', was the destination in [[Hades]] within the [[Fugue Plane]], where the [[soul]]s of mortals went following their death. It was governed by the numerous gods of death, namely [[Kelemvor]], [[Cyric]], and [[Jergal]].",
        "Description": {
            "Depictions": "Certain [[book]]s published in [[Faer√ªn]] known as 'penitentials' featured horrific scenes that depicted mortal [[soul]]s being tortured for eternity within the city."

        "Cosmography": "Using the older iteration of the [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great Wheel]] cosmological model, the City of Dead was situated within [[Oinos]], the first layer of [[Hades]] in the [[Lower planes]].",
        "Notable Locations": "According to the three primary cosmological models, the [[Crystal Spire]], formerly known as the Bone Tower, stood directly in the center of the city.\n\nThe city itself was encircled by the [[Wall of the Faithless]], consisted of the souls of those judged as the [[Faithless]] by Kelemvor.",
        "History": "Throughout its existence, raiding [[demon]]s would occasionally tear souls from the Wall of the Faithless and return with them to the [[Abyss]]. These captured souls were used to spawn new low-level demons to swell the demonic ranks or to feed their masters.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, according to the [[Calendar of Harptos]], the soul of the mortal hero Kelemvor led the denizens in the City of Strife (as it was then known) in revolt against the god Cyric. The petitioners and other residents marched upon the Bone Castle, overthrew the God of Strife, and installed Kelemvor as his replacement.",
        "Inhabitants": "The City of the Dead was largely inhabited by [[petitioner]]s, mortal souls left waiting for their [[patron deity]] to escort them to [[plane of existence|another plane]] for the rest of their [[afterlife]]. The souls waited aimlessly in the city, beseeching their respective gods and often wholly unaware that they had died. Not all souls were called away to serve their god however, and others were [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] on the [[Prime Material plane]].\n\nFollowers of Kelemvor and Jergal in life were given positions of authority in the city. [[The False]] and the Faithless as well as the souls of the dead also populated the city."
