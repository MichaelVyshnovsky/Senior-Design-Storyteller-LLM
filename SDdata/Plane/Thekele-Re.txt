'''Thekele-Re''' was one of the triangular [[divine realm]]s that made up [[Heliopolis]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. It was the domain of the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic]] and [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity]] [[Ra]]

==Geography==
It was a wide expanse of desert, with no place to hide from the scorching sun. which was guided across the sky by the solar barge [[Matet]]. Overall it was the hottest of three domains that made up Heliopolis, with the heat striking even indoors and in shadowed area. The only respite from this heat was whenever the sun faded and the realm fell to night, as then the temperature would drop dramatically.
===Flora & Fauna===
Fauna were almost never seen out during the day in his realm, due to the unbearable heat of the sun. Some of the creatures that were known to inhabit Thekele-Re and come out prowling during the night included [[lion]]s, [[serpent]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[camel]]s.
===Planar Traits===
[[Undead]] were incapable of entering Thekele-Re, reflecting Ra's own hatred towards them. Any undead creature who dared to trespass the borders of this domain would quickly wither away and explode.

==Notable Locations==
* '''Thekele-Re''': a [[tent]] filled city that had a tremendous open-air market The tents in this city helped to minize the severity of the heat given off by the domain's scorching sun.
* '''Three Pyramids of the Sun''': three large pyramidal structures.
* '''Manu, the Hill of Sunrises''': a great hill

==Inhabitants==
This divine realm was primarily inhabited by [[petitioner]]s, who largely had swarthy skin. They were always more than willing to strike a deal with travelers, selling their various wares at reasonable prices. Those who lived outside the city were even willing to provide food and shelter. However, they did not like being taken advantage of and would expect people to pitch-in in return for such services or do an errand for them.
===Notable Inhabitants===
* '''Adnus Skorpios''': a blunt, straightforward, and overall friendly [[human]] [[proxy]] of Ra who governed the town of Thekele-Re.
