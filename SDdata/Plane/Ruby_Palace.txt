The Ruby Palace was the divine realm of Sardior, Master of the Gem Dragons.
The Ruby Palace was an immense floating castleBased on the artists impression.
When spotted from below, the Ruby Palace appeared as a red star in an unusual place among the constellations.
The Ruby Palace moved among the highest clouds far above the world, always keeping on the night side.
Sardior was also known to move his fortress through the planes, occasionally visiting the djinni Citadel of Ice and Steel, and Uroboros, the realm of Jazirian.
Aside from the Ruby Dragon himself and his petitioners, his court of six, later five, thanes resided in the Ruby Palace Aleithilithos (an amethyst dragon), Hrodel (a crystal dragon), Smargad (an emerald dragon), Charisma (a sapphire dragon), Tithonnas (a topaz dragon), and Seradess, (an obsidian dragon), who was destroyed by Sardior at some point for reasons unknown. Obsidian dragons in general were also expelled at that time.
