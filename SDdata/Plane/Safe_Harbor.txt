'''Safe Harbor''' was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian demigod]] [[Valkur]] the Mighty.

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Safe Harbor could be found in [[Ysgard (layer)|Ysgard]], the first layer of the [[chaotic good]] [[Ysgard|plane of the same name]].

In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the realm was located on [[Tempus]]' plane of [[Warrior's Rest]]. There, it lay between the large sea area on which naval battles took place and the mainland desert where the petitioners of the other deities of war gloried in their constant struggles.

==Description==
Safe Harbor itself was a large stretch of calm sea.
