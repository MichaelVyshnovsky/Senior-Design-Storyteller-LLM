Niflheim, also called Northmens Despair was the second layer, also called second gloom, of Hades.
Niflheim consisted mostly of forestland with bluffs that jutting out, which quickly fell away. Put simply, the layer looked like a gray version of a forestland on the Prime Material plane.
Niflheim had no disease problem like Oinos, the first layer, had. The air was cooler than on Oinos. This gave rise to fog. This fog had some properties that made life on Nilfheim harder. First, vision was limited. Even with darkvision, people could not see further than  at most. Second, the mist had sound impeding effects. These two made predators, of which trolls, fiendish dire and normal wolves were the most common, dangerous. Third, the resulting dampness caused non-tended metal to rust.
Yggdrasil, the World Ash, had its roots at the heart of Niflheim. There, the dragon Nidhogg endlessly and furiously chewed on the tree, carving a hole in its roots. The dragon usually ignored travelers going up and down the branches, but furiously defended herself and her progeny against threats.
