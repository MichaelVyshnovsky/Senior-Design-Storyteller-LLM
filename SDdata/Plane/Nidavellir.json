        "mainbody": "'''Nidavellir''', also known as '''Dark Home''', was the third layer of [[Ysgard]]. It consisted of a series of underground tunnels and vast warm caverns. It contained numerous [[divine realm]]s and was the location of two major warring realms: one by the same name ([[Nidavellir (realm)|Nidavellir]]) and [[Svartalfheim]], which was believed to be the [[divine realm]] of [[Eilistraee]].",
        "Description": "Like [[Ysgard (layer)|Ysgard]] and [[Muspelheim]], the other two layers of the plane, the landmasses of Nidavellir also consisted of moving [[earthmote|earthberg]]s. However, whereas in the other two layers the earthbergs rarely collided, in Nidavellir they were constantly grinding against each other, so the only habitable spaces were located in the cavities formed between them.\n\nThe entirety of the layer was underground. Its tunnels, chambers, and caverns were kept warm by hot springs and geysers, which provided ample heat to sustain the native vegetation, which consisted of woods that required no sunlight to grow.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Brassberg]], realm of [[Hlal]].\n* The [[Cavern of Rest]], realm of [[Marthammor Duin]].\n* The [[Merciful Court]], realm of [[Sharindlar]].\n* [[Nidavellir (realm)|Nidavellir]], a realm of [[Ysgardian dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s with an unclear ruler.\n* [[Svartalfheim]], a realm of [[drow]] that was believed to belong to [[Eilistraee]], although its true power was not known for certain, as rumors persisted that it belonged to [[Erevan Ilesere]] instead, or some other power.",
        "Inhabitants": "Most of the layer was inhabited by dwarves and gnomes who, despite their natural animosity towards each other, worked together in their forges and crafts. The drow inhabitants of Svartalfheim were not evil like their counterparts from the [[Prime Material plane]] and wished only to be left alone."
