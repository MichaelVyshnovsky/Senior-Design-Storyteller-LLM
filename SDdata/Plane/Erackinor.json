        "Cosmography": "[[File:ErackinorMap.jpg|thumb|273px|''A sideways depiction of Erackinor and its cavernous depths.'']]\nErackinor was connected to the realms of all other deities in the Morndinsamman. The city of [[Berronar's Side]] held two ''[[portal]]s'': one to the [[Outlands]] leading to the [[Dwarvish Mountain]] and one to [[Arcadia]] leading to [[Mount Clangeddin]] in [[Abellio]], while Moradin's forge had ''portals'' to all other realms.",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Soul Forge]], Moradin's forge and the birthplace of [[dwarves]]. The forge itself was a {{SIAdj|40|ft|adj=tall}} block of solid [[mithral]] next to a wall of ice and a pool of [[soulfire]], with walls lined with immense tools, in constant use by Moradin and attended at all times by dwarf [[petitioner]]s carrying out maintenance tasks. It also contained ''portals'' to every divine realm of the Morndinsamman.\n* Berronar's Side, a fortified city partially located on the surface whose purpose was to defend its ''portals''.\n* [[Istor's Forge]], a circular city built around a core of white-hot [[lava]], known for its forges and foundries.\n* [[The Rift]], the most welcoming city to outsiders in the realm, built around a narrow crevasse. It was famous for its shops that sold exquisite dwarven work, as well as items that were favored by [[archon]]s.\n* [[Stonefall]], a surface city located at the bottom of a dark valley, famous for its stonework and lined with sculptures that narrated taled of dwarven myth and history.",
        "Inhabitants": "The realm's main inhabitants were the dwarf petitioners, who worked in the underground cities as stonemasons, sculptors, miners, armorers, ''etc.'', working toward union with their deities. Archons were friends of the dwarves, but their relationship was distant."
