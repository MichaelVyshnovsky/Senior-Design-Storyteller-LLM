        "mainbody": "Erackinor was a system of vast subterranean halls within the slopes of Solania, the fourth layer of Mount Celestia. It was the divine realm of Moradin and Berronar Truesilver according to the Great Wheel cosmology, from where they led the Morndinsamman.\nThe realm was an immense network of tunnels and halls carved with an impossibly high level of stonework skill. The tunnels extended under most of Solania, with multiple towns located within rifts and chambers. The heat and sound of forges filled the subterranean air. It was a place of great joy for all dwarves and even for non-dwarf miners.\nThe gate into the realm was guarded by the warden archon Zagzagel, who also worked as a teacher. The realms inhabitants frequently discarded the tailings and slag from their mining operations out the entrance. The wasted materials flowed down the slopes, serving as an indication to visitors of the realms location.\nThe ability to magically create new things was considerably amplified in Erackinor. Spells such as heroes feast lasted twice as long, for example, while spells that produced new materials resulted in twice the normal amount. Enchantment magic did not enjoy these benefits, however, since it was not considered an act of creation.\nthumb|273px|A sideways depiction of Erackinor and its cavernous depths.\nErackinor was connected to the realms of all other deities in the Morndinsamman. The city of Berronars Side held two portals one to the Outlands leading to the Dwarvish Mountain and one to Arcadia leading to Mount Clangeddin in Abellio, while Moradins forge had portals to all other realms.\n* The Soul Forge, Moradins forge and the birthplace of dwarves. The forge itself was a  block of solid mithral next to a wall of ice and a pool of soulfire, with walls lined with immense tools, in constant use by Moradin and attended at all times by dwarf petitioners carrying out maintenance tasks. It also contained portals to every divine realm of the Morndinsamman.\n* Berronars Side, a fortified city partially located on the surface whose purpose was to defend its portals.\n* Istors Forge, a circular city built around a core of white-hot lava, known for its forges and foundries.\n* The Rift, the most welcoming city to outsiders in the realm, built around a narrow crevasse. It was famous for its shops that sold exquisite dwarven work, as well as items that were favored by archons.\n* Stonefall, a surface city located at the bottom of a dark valley, famous for its stonework and lined with sculptures that narrated taled of dwarven myth and history.\nThe realms main inhabitants were the dwarf petitioners, who worked in the underground cities as stonemasons, sculptors, miners, armorers, etc., working toward union with their deities. Archons were friends of the dwarves, but their relationship was distant."
