'''Tiamat's Lair''' was the [[divine realm]] and prison of [[Tiamat]] in [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].

==Geography==
The realm was a large cave system within a tall mountain, hidden in the hills of Avernus. It held the only known ''[[portal]]'' that led to the second layer, [[Dis]].

The caves were littered with Tiamat's own treasure hoard, which lay scattered on the floor throughout the complex.

==Defenses==
Tiamat's Lair was patrolled from the sky by numerous flights of [[dragon]]s.

The ''portal'' to Dis was guarded by Tiamat herself. She only let those who offered a worthy sacrifice through.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a ritual performed at the behest of [[Severin Silrajin]] by a group of exiled [[Red Wizards of Thay]] with the help of [[Zariel]] brought Tiamat's Temple into the [[Well of Dragons]] in the [[Sunset Mountains]], as part of an attempt to summon her to [[Toril]].

==Rumors & Legends==
It was unclear why Tiamat was imprisoned in Avernus. Some sages suggested that Tiamat was bound to the layer as a result of a powerful curse from a [[Giant pantheon|giant deity]] slain by her, at the time of the [[Thousand Year War|war]] between dragons and [[giant]]s. Her confinement marked the end of that conflict, as well as the end of the dominance of giants and dragons in the [[Prime Material plane]], opening the way for the dominance of [[humanoid]] civilization.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Tiamat's Temple]], center of Tiamat's Lair.

==Inhabitants==
Tiamat was effectively a prisoner within the layer of Avernus. In a similar way to [[devil]]s, Tiamat could not leave the plane of her own will, but instead only through a powerful summoning ritual.

The lair was also inhabited by Tiamat's mates and their descendants. The realm was generally avoided by [[demon]]s, who were aware of Tiamat's lack of interest in the [[Blood War]]. It was, however, occasionally visited by [[devil]]s offering gifts, hoping to seal bargains with Tiamat.
