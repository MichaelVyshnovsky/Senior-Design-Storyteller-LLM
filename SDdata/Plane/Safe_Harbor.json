        "mainbody": "Safe Harbor was the divine realm of the Faer√ªnian demigod Valkur the Mighty.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, Safe Harbor could be found in Ysgard, the first layer of the chaotic good plane of the same name.\nIn the World Tree cosmology, the realm was located on Tempus plane of Warriors Rest. There, it lay between the large sea area on which naval battles took place and the mainland desert where the petitioners of the other deities of war gloried in their constant struggles.\nSafe Harbor itself was a large stretch of calm sea."
