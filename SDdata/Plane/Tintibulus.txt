'''Tintibulus''' was the third layer of [[Acheron]]. It was a mostly deserted expanse of loudly colliding boulders of different shapes and sizes, which often attracted magical researchers for its remoteness and isolation.

==Description==
Unlike the top layers of [[Avalas]] and [[Thuldanin]], the blocks of Tintibulus were not exclusively shaped like cubes. Rather, regular solids of other shapes were often found floating in the layer, with eight- and twelve-sided blocks being common, although any number of sides was possible. The solids were composed of gray volcanic stone, coated with a layer of ash-like dust of varying depths.

Collisions were frequent throughout the layer, carving hexagon-shaped crevices on the solids along naturally occurring fault lines and breaking the solids up into smaller shapes. Those collisions produced a constant ringing sound that could be loudly heard across the entire layer, in many cases impairing communication.

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Hopping Tower]], an ancient tower constructed by [[specter]]s and occupied by the insane [[wizard]] [[Lysander]], a former [[Sensates|Sensate]] who had developed many different [[spell]]s that drew on the power of Acheron and the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance]].
