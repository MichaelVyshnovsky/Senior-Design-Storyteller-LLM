The '''Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia''' ({{Pronounce|ar|KAY|dee|a|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}|audio=Arcadia.ogg}}) was the [[Outer Plane]] representing alignments between [[lawful neutral]] and [[lawful good]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model. Some characteristics of this plane were ascribed to the [[World Tree cosmology]] planes of [[Dwarfhome]], [[House of the Triad]], and even [[Dweomerheart]] when that cosmology became popular. Dwarfhome and the House of the Triad (which became known as [[Celestia]]) survived the [[Spellplague]] and became part of the [[World Axis cosmology]]. Dweomerheart was destroyed at the start of the Spellplague.

==Description==
Arcadia connected to [[Seven Heavens]], [[Nirvana]], and [[Concordant Opposition]] by portals made of either white [[ivory]] or black steel, shaped like flower trellises. These portals were few in number but rested at fixed locations in the first layer. Little is known about the other two layers.

===Abellio===
{{Main|Abellio}}
Abellio was the first layer of Arcadia in the Great Wheel cosmology. An endless stretch of orderly plains dotted with a few mountains and hills, it contained the [[divine realm]]s of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] and [[Marduk]].

===Buxenus===
{{/Imagemap}}
{{Main|Buxenus}}
Buxenus was the second layer of Arcadia in the Great Wheel cosmology. It contained the [[divine realm]]s of [[Azuth]] and [[Savras]], as well as [[Heliopolis]], the shared divine realm of [[Horus-Re]], [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], and [[Ra]] of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

=== Nemausus ===
{{Main|Nemausus}}
In the Great Wheel cosmology, Nemausus was moved to [[Mechanus]] and was no longer the third layer of Arcadia.

===Orb of Day and Night===
The Orb of Day and Night was a great sphere perched atop Arcadia's highest peak, with one half glowing and the other half dark. It rotated evenly and continually, at all times illuminating one half of the infinite plane and leaving the rest in natural darkness. This caused day and night in Arcadia, though there was no twilight, just day and night.

==Inhabitants==
Many woodland creatures roamed the mountains, hills, forests, and fields of Arcadia. They resembled Prime Material creatures except for their coloring, which was metallic like the trees, and their eyes, which were white without iris or pupil. Examples included copper colored rabbits, golden foxes, and sheep with silver wool. Organized, hive-dwelling insects such as ants, bees, and wasps were also found in this plane. None of the animals could speak but all were peaceful in nature and native to the [[Outer Planes]] so they were unaffected by magics that usually worked on Prime Material creatures. In addition, their eyes allowed them to see through any [[illusion]] and the more intelligent animals could be trained into superb watch beasts.

The primary inhabitants of Arcadia were the spirit legions formed from the souls of good and lawful warriors, much like their evil counterparts in [[Acheron]]. Other sentient creatures that dwelled in Arcadia included [[hollyphant]]s, [[planetar]]s, [[foo creature]]s and the occasional [[deva]]. It was not uncommon to see creatures from neighboring planes visiting: [[shedu]], greater and lesser [[lammasu]], and [[ki-rin]] for example.

==Realms==
* [[Azuth]] the High One, Patron of Magic Users, once had a [[Azuth (realm)|realm sharing his name]] on the layer of Buxenus.
* [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], the dwarven Father of Battle once commanded [[Mount Clangeddin|an impenetrable fortress carved out of a mountain]] located near the peak that held the sphere of day and night. It was said that this mountain redoubt was big enough to house all the dwarves on the Prime Material Plane.
* [[Marduk]] the Valiant of the [[Untheric pantheon]] once made his home also named [[Marduk (realm)|Marduk]] in Arcadia in a simple but well-ordered large city.<ref>
* The three [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi deities]] [[Horus-Re]] (and [[Ra]] before him<ref group="note">In [[Planescape]] material, [[Ra]] had Thekele-Re as his realm, while [[Horus]] roamed all of Heliopolis. According to ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'', [[Horus-Re]], who emerged after the death of [[Re]], [[Mulhorand]]i incarnation of Ra, ruled Thekele-Re.), [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]] shared a realm called [[Heliopolis#Great Wheel Cosmology|Heliopolis]] on the second layer, Buxenus.<ref><ref><ref>[[Colin McComb|McComb, Colin]], and [[Wolfgang Baur]].

* [[Savras]] the All-Seeing resided in the caverns called [[the Eye]] on Buxenus.
