'''Prismeer''' was a [[Domain of Delight]] found in the [[parallel plane]] known as the [[Feywild]]. It was created and ruled by the [[archfey]] [[Zybilna]], an alias of the [[Oerth]]ian [[archmage]] [[Tasha]].

{{Quote|This is all very odd. This doesn't feel like Prismeer at all...Zybilna can't possibly be in charge anymore|[[Ellywick Tumblestrum]], venturing into the warped forest of [[Thither]].}}

==Description==
Like other domains within the Feywild, Prismeer's appearance shifted depending on the emotions of those that dwelled within. Zybilna herself could reshape all of Prismeer with a dramatic shift in her feelings, while her period of dormancy allowed others to alter the domain to their own will.

Following its takeover by a [[coven]] of [[hag]]s, Prismeer was split into three distinct realms: the lurking swamp of [[Hither]], the ancient woods of [[Thither]], and the perilous mountains of [[Yon]]. Each of the realms were separated from the others by obstructive walls of mist, similar to those that surrounded the domain as a whole.

===Magic===
Any children that entered into Prismeer―whether intentionally, inadvertently, or otherwise―were protected by magic enchantments created by Zybilna. It was noteworthy that children never seemed to age within Prismeer, regardless of how long they dwelled within.

Death played out different in Prismeer than it did on the [[Prime Material plane]]. In some instances, a creature's body could decay in here moments or turn to stone after its death. In others, the remains could be ''[[gentle repose|placed into a form of stasis]]'' or ''[[revivify|instantly rejuvinated]]'', albeit in a weakened state.

===Laws===
Prismeer was bound by a set of laws forged by Zybilna, to which every living being within was subject:
* The '''Rule of Hospitality''', which stated everyone was required to be welcoming and congenial to anyone that entered into their home, unless they demonstrated they were unworthy of such accommodation.
* The '''Rule of Ownership''', which forbade thievery or burglary of any kind.
* The '''Rule of Reciprocity''', which directed that anyone receiving of a gift was expected to return the gesture in kind, even if in the distant future.

Failure to adhere to Zybilna's three rules led to excommunication from Prismeer.

==Cosmography==
Like other Domains of Delight, Prismeer was bound entirely within the Feywild. It was confined within great walls of mists, passage through was was only granted by express consent of the domain's ruling archfey.

The ancient forests of Prismeer held numerous ''[[faerie ring]]s'' that were ''[[fey crossroad]]s'' that bound Prismeer to various worlds in different [[crystal sphere]]s, and one within the [[Witchlight Carnival]].

==Notable Locations==
[[File:Palace_of_Heart's_Desire.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Palace of Heart's Desire, Zybilna's home in the center of Prismeer.'']]
* [[Palace of Heart's Desire]], Zybilna's personal refuge that attracted wayward mortal visitors from across the [[multiverse]].

==History==
At some point in time, control over Prismeer was stripped from Zybilna from her three hag stepsisters, known collectively as the [[Hourglass Coven]]. The coven split the domain into three distinct realms, each of which one of the sisters claimed as their own.
