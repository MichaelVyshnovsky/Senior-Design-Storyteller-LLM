The '''Cave of Greed''', formerly known as '''the Dragonspawn Pits of Azharul''' (or more simply '''Azharul''' or '''the Dragonspawn Pits'''{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells}}), was the [[divine realm]] of the [[Draconic pantheon|draconic deities]] [[Azharul]] and later [[Tiamat]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)| author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| topicid = 19841| postid = 464818| whichpage = 7| date = 2015-02-12| accessdate = 2020-04-02}}

==Cosmography==
In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], the Dragonspawn Pits were found on [[Avernus]], the first of the [[Nine Hells]].

In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the Cave of Greed was located in the lowest reaches of the [[Dragon Eyrie]], far underground beneath the slopes of the mountain. Planar borders only weakly separated this region from the Nine Hells.

==Description==
The realm consisted of an enormous convoluted cavern that contained the lair of its deity and, at some distance, those of its various petitioners and other inhabitants.

==History==
Around [[1371 DR]], Azharul was attacked, defeated, and his essence subsumed by Tiamat. The Dragon Queen renamed his Dragonspawn Pits to the Cave of Greed, and used his body, name, and realm as a false front in her machinations.

When the [[Spellplague]] hit in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the Dragon Eyrie dissolved and the Azharul aspect of Tiamat was flung into [[Banehold]]. It is unclear if the Cave of Greed was destroyed or transported there in the process.
