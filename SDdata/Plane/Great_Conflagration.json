        "mainbody": "The Great Conflagration, also known as the Para-Elemental Plane of Smoke and the Plane of Ash, was the Inner Plane at the intersection of the Planes of Air and Fire. It was a place of hot and noxious vapors and gases.\nThe plane was an endless firestorm of hot smoke and ash, fueled by the winds of the Plane of Air mixed with the fires and magma of the Plane of Fire. In some locations, the ashes coalesced into floating solid regions that could be used as shelters for fugitives and outlaws."
