        "mainbody": "The Elemental Plane of Earth was an Inner Plane of the Great Wheel cosmology and the World Tree cosmology models. After the Spellplague, the Elemental Plane of Earth collapsed into the Elemental Chaos, mixing with all the other Inner Planes. Earth is one of the four elements and two energies that make up the known universe and therefore of keen interest to cosmologists. The abundance of large gems and huge ore deposits lured many greedy prospectors to brave the significant dangers of this plane.\nAccording to the Great Wheel cosmology model, the Elemental Plane of Earth could be reached via the Ethereal Plane, an adjacent elemental plane, or by an elemental vortex. If traveling through the Deep Ethereal, a brown curtain of vaporous color indicated the boundary of the Plane of Earths Border Ethereal region. Once in the Border Ethereal, a traveler could observe the Plane of Earth and be detected by its denizens. Using the spherical model, this plane was adjacent to the para-elemental planes of Ooze and Magma and the quasi-elemental planes of Minerals and Dust. Temporary gates could be created by the plane shift&nbsp spell or the abilities of high level druids.\nIn the World Tree cosmology model, the Astral Plane connected all planes with the Prime Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane was only used for journeying between locations on the Prime. The Elemental Plane of Earth was not connected or coterminous with any other elemental plane. The spell astral projection&nbsp could be used to reach the Plane of Earth via a moss granite color pool. Additionally, the gate&nbsp and plane shift&nbsp spells could be used to open a temporary portal to this plane, but could be extremely dangerous unless the destination was previously scouted. To reach the Plane of Earth by means of a plane shift spell required a zinc fork tuned to the note of A.\nAn unusual ability granted by Moradin to his ardent followers, the Hammers of Moradin, allowed them to use the Earth Plane as a transitive plane much like the shadow walk spell allowed spellcasters to skirt the edge of the Shadow Plane and quickly travel between locations on the Prime Plane.\nThe Elemental Plane of Earth was an infinite expanse of solid matter pockmarked by bubbles of other elements and riddled with fissures and tunnels created by burrowing creatures or the occasional small mining operation. Ensconced in a few of these pockets were trading outposts and the rare hidden wizard fortress. Open spaces were gradually filled by the relentless shifting or until their eyes reached an open space where darkvision could operate or a source of light could be produced. Hearing was actually enhanced while encased in earth, to the point where travelers could detect any movement through the rock within a certain radius of their position.\nAs described by the Great Wheel model, the solid earth changed in proximity to the para- and quasi-elemental planes. A native guide was necessary to find these border regions and each had their own dangers. Near the Plane of Ooze, more water was present and the rock gradually lost cohesion. Approaching the Plane of Magma the temperature rose until the rock glowed with heat and became viscous. Proximity to the Negative Material plane dessicated the earth and caused it to crumble to dust. Toward the Positive Material plane, veins of ore, crystal, and gems became richer and more prevalent, finally crossing the border to the quasi-elemental plane of Minerals.\nEvery type of rock, soil, mineral, metal ore, sand, and dirt could be found here in abundance, ranging from talc soft to marble tough to diamond hard. Mining operations tended to be small and short-lived because the movement of the substance of the plane and intense gravity caused cave-ins, and the native population defended their territory and/or food supply.\n*The Great Dismal Delve\n*The Sevenfold Mazework\n*The Hidden Fulcrum\n*The Pale River\n*The Iron Crucible\n*The Aviary was a gigantic air-filled cavern inhabitated by a colony of avariel due to its effective lack of gravity it was a paradise for all who enjoyed flying.\n*Geb of the Mulhorandi pantheon had a realm here called the Caverns under the Stars.\n*Grumbar, the Lord of the Earth, Gnarly One, King of the Land Below the Roots, Boss of Earth Elementals,  was thought to be a mountain-sized earth elemental with god-like powers that rarely granted audiences.\n* Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil, Great Khan of the Dao, the Fountain of Wealth, the Perfect Compass, Atamen of the Mountains Roots, and other titles lived in the Great Dismal Delve in a palace called the Sevenfold Mazework.\n*Ogremoch, Prince of Evil Earth Creatures, had a citadel called Stonemire atop a large mesa within a huge pocket of vacuum near the paraplane of Magma.\n*Sunnis, Princess of Good Earth Creatures, resided in a fortress called Sandfall.\nthumb|370x370px\nThe matter of the plane itself came to life, with earth elementals being the most numerous creatures on the plane, Then there were the alien-looking khargra, xorn, and xaren with tri-fold symmetric bodies and a taste for metal. All natives and some creatures with an earth-affinity could move through the plane like a fish through water, the rock flowing around them and closing back up again, leaving no tunnel.In 1st and 2nd editions, creatures like xorn adjusted their molecular structure in order to pass though solid rock. This operation took a combat round and made them vulnerable to a phase door spell.\nImmigrants and visitors to the Elemental Plane of Earth included basilisks (greater), chaggrin, the dao, dwarves, an occasional blue or copper dragon, galeb duhr, janni, lava children, mephits of the earth and salt subtypes, sandlings, stone giants, thoqqua, and wraiths."
