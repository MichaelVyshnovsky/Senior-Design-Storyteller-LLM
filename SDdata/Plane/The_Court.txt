The Court was one of the divine realms of Tyr, the God of Law.
The Court included a massive marble hall from which Tyr ruled his realm much like a court of law. It was impossible to lie in Tyrs realm.
The Court was on the summit of one of three great mountains surrounding the base of Mount Celestia, making it&mdashfrom the point of view of the Great Wheel cosmology&mdasha part of Lunia or&mdashfrom the point of view of the World Tree cosmology&mdasha part of the House of the Triad. The realm was adjacent to that of Siamorphe, whose Alabaster Palace was located in a lush vale between the Court and Celestia.
