'''Avernus''' was the first layer of the [[Nine Hells|Nine Hells of Baator]]. The most likely beachhead for any attack by [[demon]]-kind, it was the primary battleground of the [[Blood War]]: legions of [[devil]]s marched across its plains in continual readiness to repel the hordes of demon invaders that sailed the River [[Styx]] into the layer.

==Geography==
Avernus was the largest layer of Baator and one of the most traditionally infernal—a blasted hellscape in the most literal sense filled with rivers of lava, barren hills, and low, rocky mountains as far as the eye could see. dotted with bubbling [[tar pit]]s, sucking [[quicksand]], lakes of lava, and [[salt]] flats made from the tears of the damned.

[[File:Zariel_in_Avernus-5e.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Zariel]] flying across the wastelands of Avernus.]]

Fireballs raced across the dark sky of Avernus, seemingly at random (but on closer inspection actively targeted motion), and fell to the scorched earth, leaving smoking impact craters and burnt corpses in their wake. Roiling clouds of red and black flickered with orange flames 

Blood, as it would happen, was the leitmotif of Avernus; it was where the [[River of Blood]] ran through Baator, collecting rivulets from every gulch, stream, and pool, from the victims of millions of battles.

==Cosmography==
As with all the [[lower planes]], the River Styx ran through Avernus, with a number of offshoots and falls.<ref> The Styx, which at one point flowed at the edge of the layer, was later located at its center thanks to a relentless baatezu campaigning and conquering of gate-towns along the layer's edges.

==Government==

Whether for the living or the dead, Avernus was the entry point to Baator and the most commonly visited of the Nine Hells, since [[Asmodeus]] forbade any portals opening to other regions. Because of this, damned souls had to come through Avernus before reaching other layers of the Nine Hells and so the layer was frequently inhabited by the servants of other archdevils, such as the [[barbazu]]s that gathered the forsaken, or [[imp]] and [[spinagon]] messengers. The primary reason for the magical restriction was that, for a demonic invasion force to access the lower layers of Hell, they would be forced to conquer and claim the layer directly above it.

As the buffer between the Nine Hells and the [[Abyss]], Avernus was incredibly dangerous even without its natural hazards, as [[baatezu]] armies trained for future battles. It was in a state of constant expansion by military conquest.

The ruler of Avernus was titled the Lord of the First.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|18-21}} was demoted by Asmodeus and made her advisor. She resided in a soaring basalt citadel. When he ruled, Bel dwelled in his own fortress at the center of the [[Bronze Citadel]].

==Trade==
The famous material known as Baatorian green steel could only be found on the wasteland level of Avernus. This ore was extracted from deep shafts in large-scale mining operations. The ore could be used to forge green-tinted [[steel]], tougher, sharper, and lighter than steel found on the Prime.

==History==
[[File:Bloodwar.jpg|thumb|500x350px|The [[Blood War ]]in full swing on Avernus. Click on the image to get the full effect.]]
Avernus was once ruled by then-archfiend [[Tiamat]], who served Asmodeus faithfully.

Avernus was then ruled by [[Zariel]], until she was inevitably betrayed by Bel, a pit fiend general waging the Blood War and not one of the [[Dark Eight]]. He was Lord of the First by [[1372 DR]]. Bel's minions whispered that he kept Zariel prisoner deep within the Bronze Citadel and drained her of her hellish power, slowly turning her into a soul shell while he enhanced his might. Lacking the support of the other Lords of the Nine, bar maybe Asmodeus, Bel could advance no further, at least for the time being.

During Bel's rule, Asmodeus asked Tiamat to offer covert aid to Zariel in order to prevent Bel from becoming too powerful, in a ploy orchestrated with Bel to keep Tiamat herself in check,

Some time after the [[Spellplague]], Asmodeus offered Tiamat the rulership of Avernus once more. However, to avoid disappointing Asmodeus again and to prevent a conflict with Bel, Tiamat refused, instead offering to be Asmodeus' champion and devouring all who opposed him.

Some time later, Bel fell out of favor with Asmodeus for his inability to successfully repel a demonic invasion of Avernus. Zariel reclaimed her title as Lord of Avernus following Bel's demotion. He was forced to serve as Zariel's advisor

Before Zariel's second rule, Avernus was known to be a rich and civilized realm of cities and commerce. The Blood War reduced the entire layer to a blasted and abandoned wasteland, whose only functioning structures were military citadels to muster the devilish forces.
Upon her return to power, Zariel, still enraged from having been at Tiamat's mercy, assisted [[Severin Silrajin]] and a group of [[Red Wizards of Thay]] to free her from Avernus, if only to rid the layer of Tiamat's presence.

==Notable Locations==
{{/Imagemap}}
* The [[Bronze Citadel]]: A huge fortress-city dozens of square miles in extent and ringed by twelve heavily defended walls. It housed hundreds of thousands of lesser devil troops and war machines. It was constantly being added to in the form of new fortifications against attacks.
* The [[Great Avernus Road]]: A massive road leading from [[Bel]]'s fortress for the purpose of transporting large armies of devils swiftly to battle.<ref>[[Colin McComb]] (1994). ''[[Well of Worlds]]''[[Well of Worlds|.]] Edited by [[Jon Pickens]], [[Sue Weinlein]]. (TSR, Inc). ISBN 1560768932.
* The [[Pillar of Skulls]]: A hideous landmark of trophy-skulls of those killed in the Blood War. It reached a height of more than 1 mile (1.6 kilometers). It was very close to the entrance to the second layer, [[Dis]].

===Divine Realms===
* [[Draukari]], the realm of the chief deity of the [[kobold]]s, [[Kurtulmak]].
* [[Peaceable Lands]], the realm of [[Bargrivyek]], the [[goblin]] god of co-operation and territory.
* [[Tiamat's Lair]], a tall mountain that was the prison of [[Tiamat]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]| topicid    = 19841| postid     = 464818| whichpage  = 7| date       = 2015-02-12| accessdate = 2019-02-18}} A massive cave mouth near the base of the Pillar of Skulls led into Tiamat's Lair; from here, she could guard the crossing to Dis against demon attacks.

===Other Locations===
* [[Basalt Tower]], the fortress of the powerful devil [[Belhifet]].

An especially high metal spire of Dis, the plane below, skewered through the haze between layers and emerged in Avernus near the Pillar of Skulls. Its spiral stairwell let devils and [[petitioner]]s cross on foot between the layers, with many falls, by chance of otherwise.

A ''[[portal]]'' to Avernus was erected in the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1346}} in the [[Burial Glen]] of [[Myth Drannor]] by [[Church of Bane|Banites]] loyal to the High Imperceptor of [[Mulmaster]], but under the influence of [[Zhentarim]] agents and, by proxy, a cabal of [[alhoon]] living in the ruins. The alhoon had it erected so that the devils it spawned would prevent the local [[phaerimm]]s from attacking the [[lich]]es while they searched the city for [[magic]].{{Cite dragon/359/Volo's Guide: Myth Drannor, City of Song|102-103}} Although intended to only remain open a short time, interference from [[Malkizid]] caused it to become permanent. The ''portal'' was eventually closed by the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] in [[1357 DR]], though the devils it had already unleashed over the previous 11 years continued to infest the ruins until the [[Elven Crusade]] led by [[Seiveril Miritar]] in [[1374 DR]].

Another ''portal'' to Avernus was erected in [[Dragonspear Castle]] by a [[Calimshan|Calishite]] [[mage]] after [[Daeros Dragonspear]], the castle's builder, was tricked into sacrificing himself.

The layer was inhabited primarily by [[abishai]], [[lemure]]s, [[nupperibo]]s, and [[spinagon]]s. [[Imp]]s were also common, as well as [[dragon]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[kobold]]s.

Legions of devils dressed in mail stood an eternal watch on Avernus, in readiness for a sortie in the Blood War.
