        "mainbody": "The Well of Urd, was the divine realm of the Norns in the Great Wheel cosmology.\nSome believed the Well of Urd to reside in the realm of Asgard, near one of the roots of the Yggdrasil, but in reality it was merely the source of the waters of the eponymous magical spring that flowed down into the realms true location, the Outlands. This source spring was located in a cleft high up a mountain and radiated a blue glow. The actual Realm of the Norns was also located near one of the roots of the World Tree, much like the gate-town of Glorium, though the exact location of this root wasnt well known.\nThis divine realm was spatially rather small compared to many of the other divine realms that were in the Outlands, Some claimed it was situated at very edge the Outlands center, though in reality it was situated close to the gate-town of Faunel. The untamed wilderness that sprawled spireward from that realm surrounded the Realm of the Norns.\nIn Asgard, there existed a conduit in Rowans Hall that connected to an area very near the grove of the Norns.\nThis divine realm consisted of a grove that was heavily overgrown. Its thick trees and various thorns created an oppressive canopy that blotted out all light from above, giving the area a feeling as though one was within a cavern.\nAt the center of the grove stood the eponymous Well of Urd, One should instead leave such reading of fates to the Norns, who utilized the Well of Urd for that purpose.\nRepeat visitors were known to encounter slight differences in the Realm with each visit. By the late 15 century DR, the canopy of the Realm of the Norns was less oppresive, allowing those who stood within the groove to view a strange phenomenon in the sky that was only visible from within their realm. This phenomenon was that of a massive, sunset-like arch of a spinning wheel, that spun endlessly.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of Ravenian adventurers found themselves in Ysgard due to a cursed cubic gate. While there they were told by the Ysgardian dwarf Gringol Gemcrusher that they needed to visit the local home of the Norns, who erroneously referred to it as the \"Well of Mimir\".Traditionally across Core and Planescape sources, the Norns have nothing to do with the Well of Mimir. However, as the Norns actually appear in person at the \"Well of Mimir\" within the tournament module Plane Speaking, it cannot be dismissed so easily as simply being the Well of Mimir. This \"Well of Mimir\" within the adventure could possibly be explained as actually being the magical spring in Asgard thats referred to in some sources as the \"Well of Urd\", but is actually a separate spring from which the waters of the Realms of the Norn originate.\nFor much of history, only the Norns were said to permanently dwell in this grove, and were usually found gathering around the Well of Urd. They often received visitors, coming to find the nearby root of Yggdrasil or more often to try and sneak a glimpse at their fate within their magical spring.\nBy the late 15 century DR, a community had sprouted up around the grove, consisting of seers wishing to divine meaning from multiversal mystical signs, aged fortune tellers, and people burdened with curses. Some of the latter were in feverish search of means by which to end the curse that afflicted them, whilst most others lived contently, having grown to accept their affliction. These various individuals lived within scattered village-sized hubs, with most of them living solitary lives within structures meant for pondering fate, such as observatories or private hermitages.\nBy this time the Norns were still said to reside within the grove, though it was much more difficult to ascertain who they were amongst the crowds of seers, leading some to question their existence.\nAccording to rumors, the Singing Fountain in the Ladys Ward of Sigil was somehow magically linked to the Well of Urds, with some saying that the nature of this link was a portal requiring a gate key."
