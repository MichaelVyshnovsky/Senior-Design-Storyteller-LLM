        "mainbody": "The '''Crescent Grove''', also called '''''Gwyllachaightaeryll''''' (meaning '''the Many-Splendored''' in the [[Elven language]]) or simply '''Corellon's Tower''', was the great palace of [[Arvandor]] and the [[divine realm]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Sehanine Moonbow]].",
        "Cosmography": "The Crescent Grove was at the center of the [[Seldarine]]'s joint realm of Arvandor. In the [[World Tree cosmology]], Arvandor was one of the [[Celestial planes]].<ref>",
        "Description": {
            "Notable Areas": ";Overlook\n:At the center of the palace stood the rising tower with windows of crystal called the Overlook. It offered a breathtaking view of the entire realm, and even into the [[Prime Material plane|prime]] worlds that were home to elves. It was a favorite destination for visitors.In contrast to the description in the ''[[Player's Guide to Faer√ªn]]'', the depiction of Corellon's Tower in ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' shows Wisdom's Height as the tallest spire at the centre of the palace.\n\n;Wisdom's Height\n:The palace's throne room was named Wisdom's Height. As an annual event, visitors could gain an audience with Corellon and Sehaine themselves here.\n\n;The Bough of Magic's Gain\n:An area dedicated to the magical arts; according to rumor, meditating here for a whole year brought a leap in the understanding of magic.\n\n;Pureblood\n:This part of the palace was designated for the healing of the soul, meant for elves who experienced the taint of evil or the weariness of life.\n\n;Vigil's Rest\n:This was the area for the healing of the body, where ailments and illnesses could be remedied.\n\n;Council Hall\n:This big tower was the meeting ground of the [[Seldarine]], but also open to visitors."
        },
        "History": "The palace was originally a tower built by [[giant]]s, which the Seldarine wrested from the [[Giant pantheon|giant powers]] together with the rest of the Arvandor. It had long since been transformed into a truly elven affair."
