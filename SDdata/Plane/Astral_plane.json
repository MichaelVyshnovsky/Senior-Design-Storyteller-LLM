        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "[[File:Dead gods bg3.png|thumb|''One of many dead gods in the Astral Plane.'']]\nUpon entering the Astral plane, travelers saw a silvery ''[[color pool]]'' nearby&mdash;a portal to the location on the Prime Material plane from which they originated. ''Astral projecting'' travelers saw their silver cord leading back to this pool. Color pools appeared as two-dimensional circles about {{SIrange|10|60|ft}} in diameter and only visible from one side unless they had some way to detect invisible objects. Pools of different colors were portals to the different [[Outer planes]]. Each Outer plane had its own unique color, but the traveler's home portal was always a metallic silver, rippling like mercury in a pan. Color pools could be used to view the destination plane before stepping through by mentally concentrating on the nearby pool until it became transparent. A viewer could also move (with some limitations) the portal's viewpoint by concentration. ''Astral projecting'' travelers formed a new physical body (with silver cord attached) when they stepped through a color pool to their destination plane.\n\nIt was considered to be boundless."

        "Cosmology": {
            "Great Wheel": "According to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model, the Astral plane connected the [[Prime Material Plane]]s to the first layers of the [[Outer planes]].\n\n[[File:astral plane systems-5e.jpg|350px|thumb|''The Position of Realmspace (left) in the Astral plane.'']]\nIn some versions of the Great Wheel cosmology held in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was possible to travel to the Astral plane directly from [[wildspace]] aboard a [[spelljammer]]. In this cosmology, wildspace was a region where the Prime and the Astral overlapped. Moreover, upon exiting a wildspace system such as [[Realmspace]], a ship would leave this overlapping region and fully enter the Astral. The border between wildspace and the Astral Sea had the appearance of a silvery haze.\n\nOnce in the Astral, spelljamming captains could steer their ships in the direction of other wildspace systems or specific locations in the Astral in the same way that individuals would traverse the plane: by concentrating their thoughts on the destination.\n\nThis view was in contrast with the prevailing Great Wheel cosmology of the 14{{th}} and earlier centuries DR, according to which a ship would encounter a [[crystal sphere]] at the edge of its system and, if capable of traversing it, would enter the [[phlogiston]].",
            "World Tree": "[[Image:Astral Plane.jpg|thumb|left|''Travelers in the Astral Plane.'']]\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]], the Astral plane was described as a shapeless cloud that surrounded ''all'' the other planes (including the [[Inner Planes]] which were not accessible via the Astral in the Great Wheel model). The World Tree cosmology model interpreted the Astral plane as tree-shaped, touching nearly all planes, and overlapping the [[World Tree]] as well. The ramification of this was that travel between planes was not easily accomplished without going through the \"trunk\" of the tree (the Material plane). Direct connections between separate dominions of the gods was only possible by cooperation between the deities in question.\n\nThe Astral Plane had the following [[Planar traits|traits]] in the World Tree cosmology model:\n* '''Subjective Directional Gravity''':The [[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition]] states on page 47 that the Astral Plane had the '''No Gravity''' trait but the [[Player's Guide to Faerûn]] says on page 142 that the Astral plane functioned as described in the [[Dungeon Master's Guide v.3.5]] and differed only in shape. a traveler picked a \"down\" direction and \"fell\" in the direction until a new direction was chosen.\n* '''Timeless''': the effects of time were suspended until the traveler exited the Astral Plane, whereupon the effects retroactively occurred.\n* '''Mildly Neutral-Aligned''': no circumstance penalties.\n* '''Enhanced Magic''': Spells and spell-like abilities required less time to be cast.\n\nColor pools still existed in this model, but an Astral traveler had to choose the destination plane before setting out and would only encounter pools that lead to the chosen plane. To change destinations, the traveler had to reenter the Material plane and then begin the journey anew.\n\nToril's Material plane actually linked to several other Astral planes, each of which connected Toril to the outer-planer homes of a different set of deities. They were based on the geographical areas of control held by the different pantheons. As such, there was an Astral Plane for the [[Maztica]]n and [[Zakharan pantheon|Zakhara]]n pantheons (even though many of the Zakharan deities resided on the Material Plane). The [[Kara-Tur]]an faiths were not connected to their own astral plane, as instead their deities connected to the [[Spirit World]]. Very little was known in [[Faerûn]] about these other astral planes, but it was theorized that [[Ao]] supervised them just as he adjudicated the conflicts between the pantheons.",
            "World Axis": "According to the [[World Axis cosmology]], the [[Spellplague]] set the dominions adrift&mdash;they were no longer linked to a tree-shaped Astral plane but floated aimlessly in the Astral Sea.\n\nThe Astral Sea was described as being \"above\" the Prime Material plane and its two reflections, the [[Feywild]] and the [[Shadowfell]]. and set the [[dominion]]s of the gods adrift to wander about in the silvery void. Access to the Astral Sea was accomplished through passages found in the world or using the proper ritual. Once in the Sea, travel was initiated by thought and was very similar to flying.\n\nIn addition to the astral dominions, the Astral Sea could be used by powerful beings to create [[demiplane]]s by focusing on an idea and applying a strong will. Each demiplane had its own traits and physical laws as dictated by the one who created it, and was always smaller than an astral dominion. If abandoned, it would break apart and fade from existence just like an astral dominion."

        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Astral Confrontation CLB.jpg|thumb|300px|''A showdown on the Astral Sea.'']]\nOn this plane of thought, the existence of true natives was doubtful.<ref> The [[githyanki]], however, had been a dominating presence for long ages,<ref> ruled from their great city of [[Tu'narath]] but mostly spread about innumerable fortresses.<ref><ref> \n\n[[Astral searcher]]s, [[astral streaker]]s, [[astral whale]]s, the mighty [[astral dragon]]s, and the tiny [[kodragon]]s inhabit the Silver Void. The dreaded [[astral dreadnought]]s are believed by some to be a manifestation of the Astral Plane itself, while others point to their indefinitely long tails as an indicator for an origin elsewhere.<ref>\n\n[[Brain collector]]s, [[dhour]]s, and [[foo creature]]s can all be found here.<ref>\n\nAll manner of [[fiend]]s, [[celestial]]s, [[slaad]]i and other planars used the Astral as shortcuts to their business elsewhere, but both [[astral deva]]s and [[shedu]] patrolled the plane regularly to keep evil in check. Despite their connection to the [[Abyss]], [[bebilith]]s were thought to be at home on the Astral plane.\n\n[[Spectral hound]]s are usually found with githyanki communities as guard animals.",
        "Deities": "The Astral Plane was the graveyard of the gods. If a deity, which could be considered among the greatest of concepts, died, its remnant were cast into this realm of thought. Here it remained as a floating \"god-isle\", a piece of solid matter within the endless empty void, with only a fraction of residual energy left.<ref>\n\nAn exception to these rules was the god [[Celestian]] from [[Oerth]].
