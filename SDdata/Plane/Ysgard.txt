The Heroic Domains of Ysgard, also referred to as Gladsheim, was the Great Wheel plane straddling the alignments of chaotic good and chaotic neutral. Like the Greek influence on Arborea, much of this plane was heavily dominated by the gods of the Norse pantheon
Some characteristics of this plane were ascribed to the World Tree cosmology planes of Arvandor, Brightwater, Gates of the Moon, and Jotunheim when that cosmology model became popular. When the Spellplague hit the cosmos, Brightwater merged with the Gates of the Moon which survived, along with Arvandor. Jotunheim was cast into the Elemental Chaos but only parts of it survived as described by the World Axis cosmology model.
The three layers of Gladsheim consisted of tremendous rivers of earth and stone that formed cosmic arches through the void, like very tightly packed asteroid belts. Millions of miles/kilometers wide, each river was made up of gigantic chunks of matter that bumped and ground against each other at a glacial but noticeable pace, raising up mountains and opening vast chasms. These "earthbergs" all shared the same gravity field and most were inhabitable on the top side while the underside of the rivers burned with a radiant fire that provided a ruddy light to the rivers below. Earthquakes and landslides were a commonly occurring danger in Gladsheim as the landscape slowly buckled and broke under the influence of chaos.
Multiple rough-hewn landings of the Infinite Staircase connected to each of Gladsheims three layers.
The name of this layer was also the name of the confederation of godly domains known as Asgard, home of the Norse pantheon, The usual color pools connecting Asgard to the Astral Plane existed but were little used. Portals in the guise of wells connected this layer to the neighboring planes of Arborea, Limbo, and Concordant Opposition. In addition to Yggdrasil, the Norse gods controlled and carefully guarded a portal directly to the Prime plane where they were the strongest, called the Bifrost or the rainbow bridge.
Other known realms adjacent to Asgard were Vanaheim (home of the vanir), Alfheim (fairyland, known for its chaotic elven spirits), and Jotenheim (home of the giants).
The earthbergs of this layer were reversed (or alternatively, gravity was reversed) so the flaming side was up and the earthen side down. Surtur and the fire giants made their home here and guarded the barriers that lead to Asgard and its neighboring realms.
The rivers of earth were in such close proximity in this layer that the entire sky was filled with fire, making it appear to travelers that they were in underground caverns and passages with a river of fire for a ceiling.
Hollyphants and planetars were fairly plentiful in Gladsheim but many of the other Upper plane regulars avoided it. Wildlife included bears, wild boars, stags and other woodland creatures, all bigger and tougher than their Prime plane counterparts. In addition, some devas and celestial eladrin made their homes on this plane.

In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Pasha Abon Duum used the power of the Catlord to travel to Tyrs realm in Gladsheim to confront Tyr with the Claw of Malar, apparently seeking to seize the power of the gods. However, "Tyr" was revealed to be Conner in a cloak, having faked his death and been spirited to Gladsheim. The Catlord stole the Claw of Malar and passed it to Conner, before the real Tyr appeared and took the artifact. With a warning that he would keep an eye on Conner and the scales of justice, he sent the heroes home while Duum was left to face Justice himself.
