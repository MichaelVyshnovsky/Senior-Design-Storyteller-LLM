'''Ysgard''' was the first layer of the [[Outer Plane]] of [[Ysgard|the same name]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. It contained numerous [[divine realm]]s, such as [[Asgard]], the realm of [[Tyr]]; the [[Gates of the Moon]], the realm of [[Selûne]]; and [[Jotunheim]], the realm of [[Surtr]] and [[Thrym]]; among others. The name of the layer was also spelled '''Asgard''', which was also the name of its largest realm.

==Geography==
Like the other layers of the plane, Ysgard was formed of vast chunks of land of sizes that varied from small to continent-like. These lands floated in the sky, flowing like rivers of earth several million miles wide along patterns that resembled huge arches in the sky. The chunks of inhabitable land slowly shifted and moved, breaking apart and crunching together. The bottom portion of those [[earthmote|earthbergs]] shone with a red light that illuminated and warmed the layers below.

Ysgard was the best known layer, as well as the most populous. Its mountainous landscape led to cold seas and, at night, the numerous earthbergs glowed in the sky along their arches, forming structures resembling rivers of lava.

The largest realms of the plane of Ysgard were found on this layer. As such, its hilly landscape was dotted with large halls and battlefields.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Alfheim]], realm of [[Wikipedia:Freyr|Frey]] of the [[vanir]] and home of chaotic [[Elf|elves]], where [[Aerdrie Faenya]] made her home within Ysgard.
* [[Asgard]], realm of [[Tyr]] and many other deities of the Norse pantheon. It was a cold land of extreme seasons.
* The [[Gates of the Moon]], realm of [[Selûne]]. An unusually peaceful realm compared to the rest of the layer. Rumors existed of a connection to the River [[Oceanus]] in the sea surrounding the realm, as well as a passage to the [[Infinite Staircase]] that only manifested itself on a full moon in Selûne's palace of [[Argentil]].
* [[Netaph]], realm of [[Anhur]].
* The [[Irvin]] River marked the boundary between Asgard and Jotunheim.
* [[Jotunheim]], the Land of the Giants, realm of [[Surtr]] and [[Thrym]]. Among the least hospitable locations in the Upper planes.
* [[Merratet]], realm of [[Bast]].
* [[Safe Harbor]], realm of [[Valkur]].
* [[Shaundiaur]], realm of [[Shaundakul]].
* [[Uthgardtheim]], realm of [[Uthgar]].
* The [[Wild Ride]], realm of [[Tarsellis Meunniduin]].{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited|16}}
