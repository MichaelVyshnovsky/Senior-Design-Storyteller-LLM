        "mainbody": "e name Happy Hunting Grounds was given to this plane by those that first scried it, assuming the abundant and varied game and wildlife would be a sportsman's paradise. But the native inhabitants of this plane were all capable of speech and comparable to [[human]]s in range of intelligence. Some of the most intelligent creatures could even wield magic. All natural creatures and their giant versions from the [[Prime Material Plane]], including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and invertebrates, excluding enchanted creatures and monsters, were represented here, and they called their home the Beastlands.\n\nThe Beastlands had three layers, all heavily forested with normal and giant trees, plants, moss, and fungi. Each layer had its own time of day which never varied. Weather was regionally distributed and provided all manner of conditions for the habitats of all creatures. Weather in one region did not affect adjacent regions, so an arid desert could exist next to a snowy winter region for example. Any attempt to control the winds, weather, or atmosphere was countered by those airborne creatures who lived in the region.\n\n[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash, extended its branches to all layers of the Beastlands. The reason was unclear, since there were no realms of the [[Norse pantheon]] anywhere in the plane. Some speculated that the wilderness and life-giving properties of the plane were sufficient to root the tree there.\n\n===Krigala===\n{{/Imagemap}}\n{{Main|Krigala}}\nKrigala was the upper layer, connected to the [[Astral Plane]] by ''[[color pool]]s'' and to [[Elysium]], [[Arborea]], and the [[Outlands]] by portals disguised as large holes in hollow trees. The river [[Oceanus]] flowed in a relatively straight course from [[Amoria]] in Elysium through [[Krigala]] on its way to Arborea. The sky was perpetually lit by a noonday sun directly overhead regardless of distance traveled.\n\n===Brux===\n{{Main|Brux}}\nThe second layer of the Beastlands was constantly in dusk or dawn due to two suns on opposite ends of the horizon, hovering there and turning the sky a reddish hue. The landscape of Brux was similar to that found in Krigala.\n\n===Karasuthra===\n{{Main|Karasuthra}}\nThe bottommost layer was the land of starlight. Above any clouds or fog that might exist in a region was a clear night sky full of wandering stars. The stars moved randomly such that all attempts to map them into constellations were unsuccessful.",

        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the myriad species from the animal kingdom were the usual [[Upper plane]] sentient creatures, [[planetar]]s, [[solar]]s, [[deva]]s, [[foo creature]]s, [[agathia]], and [[baku]].\n\nAnother form of life unique to the Beastlands were the [[mortai]], also known as the \"faces in the clouds\". They appeared as cumulus clouds with large humanoid faces and could communicate with anyone if they so wished. The mortai were considered very wise and could converse on most any subject. They also had complete control over the air and weather. Their origin was unknown but it was thought they might be collections of good and somewhat chaotic spirits.",
