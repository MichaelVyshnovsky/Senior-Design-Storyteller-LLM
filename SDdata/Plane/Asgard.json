        "Inhabitants": "All of the Aesir, one of the two groups of the Norse pantheon, had homes in Asgard, including [[Odin]] the All-Father and Tyr, who was also the Faer√ªnian god of justice.\n\nThe petitioners of Asgard were primarily former [[human]]s. Most of them were battle-loving warriors, and the greatest among them became the [[einheriar]]. The famous Valkyries were responsible for escorting these bravest fallen into Asgard for their afterlives. Among native individuals, or \"planars\", most were members of the faction known as the [[Fated]].\n\nAsgard was also home to [[moon dog]]s, [[atomie]]s, [[buckawn]]s, [[valley elf|valley elves]], [[grugach]], [[korred]], [[jackal]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[black bear]]s, [[giant raven]]s, [[falcon]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[spriggan]]s, and [[galeb duhr]].{{Cite imagine/30/The Norse Planes of Gladsheim|37}}",
