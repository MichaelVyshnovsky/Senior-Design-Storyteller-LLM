The '''Library of All Knowledge''' was the joint [[divine realm]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian deities]] [[Deneir]] and [[Milil]] within the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. It was located in [[Brux]], the twilit second layer of the [[Happy Hunting Grounds|Beastlands]].<ref><ref>

==Inhabitants==
Aside from the [[petitioner]]s striving for union with their respective deity, several [[Proxy|proxies]] inhabited the Library. Foremost among these was the [[human]] [[Tomas Bookbinder]] (at least as far as Deneir was concerned).<ref>

==Rumors & Legends==
Servants of the resident powers were able to quickly reach their common superior, [[Oghma]], in his [[House of Knowledge]] on the [[Outlands]], if the need arose. Thus it was assumed that there was a portal close by to connect the two places.

==History==
From the perspective of the [[World Tree cosmology]], which became dominant after the [[Year of Wild Magic]], Deneir and Milil were seen as residing together with Oghma and [[Gond]] in the [[celestial plane]] called the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]].<ref> The various buildings within that plane, however, were still collectively known as the Library of All Knowledge. They supposedly held all lore, songs, spells and even magic items of the universe.
