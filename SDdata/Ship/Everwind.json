        "mainbody": "'''''Everwind''''' was the name of a huge ship constructed in [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] for King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] of [[Cormyr]] by the shipbuilder [[Fharaud]]. The ship was teleported through a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Vilhon Reach]] after it was launched in [[1360 DR]] and broke apart in the portal, killing most of those onboard.",
        "Description": "The ''Everwind'' was a huge ship with strong rigging and good construction.",
        "History": "Fharaud was a wealthy shipbuilder in Innarlith in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In [[1358 DR]], he traveled to [[Marsember]] in Cormyr, where he visited an engineering college and recruited a graduate named [[Ivar Devorast]] to come back with him to Innarlith to help him construct the ship. Devorast did much of the planning and design of the ship, with Fharaud's approval. However, Devorast distrusted the use of magic ''portals'' to transport the ship between the Lake of Steam and the Vilhon Reach.<ref>\n\nThe ship was completed and launched in 1360 DR with Fharaud and a skeleton crew piloting the ship. It went through a magic ''portal'', but rather than going to its intended location in the Vilhon Reach, the portal cut the ship in pieces and dropped it, along with the crew, from a great height over the place where it was supposed to go. The crew were killed and Fharaud was severely injured and left bedridden for the rest of his life.<ref>\n\nDevorast would later be the man who came up with the plan to dig a canal from the Lake of Steam to the [[Nagaflow]], and thus connect the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the oceans of [[Toril]].<ref> However, his history with the ''Everwind'' was used as grounds to question his engineering ability.<ref>"
