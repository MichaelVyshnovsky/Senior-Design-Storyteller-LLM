The Grayling was a ship that sailed its last voyage in 1399 DR. The Grand Council of Impiltur chartered the ship to carry Bayel Droust on a mission to map the post-spellplague shoreline of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Droust carried two rare books that the eladrin Caelynna wanted and she sunk the ship in order to get the books and to capture Droust. Bayel Droust was imprisoned on the ship for many years and forced to work at translating the books.
