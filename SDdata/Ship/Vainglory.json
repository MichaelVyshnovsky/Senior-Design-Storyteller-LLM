        "mainbody": "he Vainglory was a ship that sank at the Tower of Storms in the late 15 century DR.\nThe ship was about  long and had a single mast that stood over  high, which was all that was visible of the ship above the murky water in which it was wrecked. It lay due west of the rocky outcropping on which the Tower of Storms was perched, directly beneath the lighthouse tower.\nThe Vainglory was sunk when its crew was bewitched to steer the ship onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the magic beacon of the lighthouse set by an anchorite of Talos called Moesko. The crew perished when the ship sank, and their scattered bodies were soon reduced to skeletons by hungry fish. The wreck then came to be prowled by sharks, including the fearsome Daggermaw.\nThe captain wore a cloak of many fashions, which remained intact beneath the waves even as the captains body was eaten away."
