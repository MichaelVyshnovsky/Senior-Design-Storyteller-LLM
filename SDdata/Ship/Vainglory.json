        "mainbody": "The '''''Vainglory''''' was a ship that sank at the [[Tower of Storms]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ship was about {{SI|45|feet|long=yes}} long and had a single mast that stood over {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} high, which was all that was visible of the ship above the murky water in which it was wrecked. It lay due west of the rocky outcropping on which the Tower of Storms was perched, directly beneath the lighthouse tower.",
        "History": "The ''Vainglory'' was sunk when its crew was bewitched to steer the ship onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the [[magic]] beacon of the lighthouse set by an [[anchorite of Talos]] called [[Moesko]]. The crew perished when the ship sank, and their scattered bodies were soon reduced to skeletons by hungry [[fish]]. The wreck then came to be prowled by [[shark]]s, including the fearsome [[Daggermaw]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The captain wore a ''[[cloak of many fashions]]'', which remained intact beneath the waves even as the captain's body was eaten away."
