The '''''Golden Crown''''' was a galleon from [[Calimshan]] used to transport treasure.

==History==
In the early 1330s [[DR]], the ''Golden Crown'' was carrying a cargo of [[gold]] and [[silver]] ingots, [[electrum]] bars, and a valuable quantity of [[gem]]s from the [[Calishite]] mining colony of [[Berranzo]] on the island of [[Gundarlun]] in the [[Trackless Sea]]. Also on board was the [[wizard]] [[Hoch Miraz]] of Calimshan. Struck by a storm, the ''Golden Crown'' sunk off the coast of the island, and lay beneath 70 feet (21 meters) of water. Its precious cargo and Hoch Miraz's possessions were still thought to lay there in [[1370 DR]].
