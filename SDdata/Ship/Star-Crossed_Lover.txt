'''''Star-Crossed Lover''''' was a ship that sank at the [[Tower of Storms]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
It was a single-masted ship about {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} long. As a wreck, it sat on the northwestern edge of the rocks below the Tower of Storms in murky, {{SIAdj|20|foot|long=yes}} deep water with only its mast visible above the waves.

==History==
''Star-Crossed Lover'' sank after it was lured to the Tower of Storms by the bewitching magic of [[Moesko]], an [[anchorite of Talos]], who used his heart to create a beacon to lure ships to their doom on the rocks beneath the lighthouse.

==Inhabitants==
The ship's captain died when the ship sank. In life they had wielded a [[magic weapon]], which remained clenched in their hands as their body was reduced to bones by hungry [[fish]]. The wreck was subsequently haunted by [[shark]]s, including the fearsome [[Daggermaw]].
