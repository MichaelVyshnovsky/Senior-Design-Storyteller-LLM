The '''''Arrow of Justice''''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[Armada (spelljammer)|armada]] under the command of [[Icarus]] during the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It played an important role in the [[War of the Spheres]].

==Description==
The ship was mainly active in [[Realmspace]] while under the command of Icarus.

==History==
During the early stages of the [[vodoni]] invasion of Realmspace, the ''Arrow of Justice'' intercepted a ship whose crew of adventurers had had close contact with the invading forces and could provide valuable information in order to form a defense. The ''Arrow of Justice'' escorted the adventurers' ship to the [[Rock of Bral]], where a meeting of the [[Free Space Alliance]] was held to determine the next course of action.

Throughout the battle, the ship served as the site for the war conferences and as the Alliance's flagship. In the final battle, the ''Arrow of Justice'' led the attacking forces of the Alliance into [[Vodonispace]].
