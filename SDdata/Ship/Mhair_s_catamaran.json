        "mainbody": "'''Mhair's catamaran''' was a personal watercraft operated by [[Mhair]], an apathetic man who saved his passions for [[kayak]]ing and [[cartography]].",
        "Description": "The catamaran was built from a pair of wooden [[kayak]]s rigged together with a platform across the middle. It had space for eight passengers plus Mhair himself, who pushed the boat along with a [[pole]].",
        "History": "Mhair used his catamaran to transport mind-controlled victims from the [[Sharran]] [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] across the [[Wyvernflow]] river, so that they could be sent onwards to the [[Lost Refuge]]. The catamaran was kept in the secret underground boathouse beneath the temple, alongside the prison cells and [[Mhair's kayak]]. Mhair would take it through a short underground passage at night onto the river.\n\nPrisoners who rode upon the boat included [[Dava]], [[Tholwick Styles]], [[Halish]], [[Mendios]], [[Durgen Glintstone]], [[Kareem Hastith]], [[Smote]], and [[Zephan]]. The pirate [[Veera Wavecrest]] was likely rescued by [[adventurer]]s before being forced across."
