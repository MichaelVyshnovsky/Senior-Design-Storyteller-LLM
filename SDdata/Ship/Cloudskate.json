        "mainbody": "A cloudskate was a kind of enchanted vessel used to cross the Skysea, a lethal glass flat in the Raurin desert, and was one of the few ways to access the Cursed City of Stone. It resembled a metal ship raised on two skate blades, with a single magical sail made of bronze.Sandstorm describes a non-magical variation of a cloudskate with a slightly different design. However, this particular type does not appear in the Realms.\nThe enchanted sail of a cloudskate absorbed the heat of the mirrored glass and converted it into controllable movement for the ship. At the same time, the hull absorbed the heat of the glass and turned it into a glowing magical force between the runners and allowed it to very slightly hover off the ground. Both the runners and the rudder were diamond-tipped to give them purchase against the glass, similarly to ice-skates, and while steering the rudder dug into the ground to overcome the vessels inertia. Riding a cloudskate got very hot, but it was not physically dangerous. They achieved speeds of only  per hour at night, but they reached  per hour at dawn or dusk and  per hour during the day.\nA number of cloudskates were lost and abandoned on the edge of the Skysea, ready for travelers to recover and use if they wished. Still others were still in operation by unfriendly forces.\n* Cloudskate ghostship, a malevolent haunted vessel.\n* Cloudskate pirate ship, a ship crewed by undead pirates.\nDuring the 14 century DR, a group of adventurers sought the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon but were blocked by the inhospitable Skysea. Fortunately, they found an intact cloudskate that allowed them passage to the lost city."
