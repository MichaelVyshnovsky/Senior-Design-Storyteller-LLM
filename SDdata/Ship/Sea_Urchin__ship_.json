        "mainbody": "The '''''Sea Urchin''''' was a ship that sank at the [[Tower of Storms]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "It was about {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} long. Its lone mast stood over {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} high, and was visible above the waterline after the ''Sea Urchin'' had sunk. It lay just west of the rocky outcropping on which the Tower of Storms was perched.",
        "History": "The ''Sea Urchin'' sank when its crew was compelled to steer the ship onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the [[magic]] of [[Moesko]], an [[anchorite of Talos]]. This plot was in service to the [[Cult of Talos]], who sought to plunder ships along the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. However, a chest containing a carefully packed statuette&mdash;a {{SIAdj|9|inch|c|long=yes}} [[mermaid]] made of delicate [[blue quartz]]&mdash;was never recovered from the wreck.",
        "Inhabitants": "The crew perished when the ship sank, and their bodies were striped to the bone by [[fish]] and [[shark]]s, including the fearsome [[Daggermaw]]."
