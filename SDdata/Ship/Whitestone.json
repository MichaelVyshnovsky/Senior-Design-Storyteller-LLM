        "mainbody": "'''Whitestone''' was a [[dwarven citadel]] in the [[Tears of Selûne]]. It was home to the [[Whitebeards]], a clan of [[Shield dwarf|mountain dwarves]] who mined the mountains in the [[Neverwinter Wood]] during winter.",
        "Geography": "The citadel was a mountain-sized city, carved out of an enormous white stone. It was shaped to resemble a helmed long-bearded [[dwarf]] warrior.\n\nThe citadel's main entrance was through the figure's \"mouth\". The entrance led to a lake on which a number of [[spelljammer]]s were kept docked for different purposes.\n\nWhitestone's slow orbit around [[Toril]] and its own motion within the Tears brought it closest to the planet during winter in [[north Faerûn]]. The dwarves took advantage of this proximity to send [[mining ship (spelljammer)|mining ship]]s to [[Mount Hotenow]] and the surrounding areas in the [[Neverwinter Wood]].",
        "Government": "The Whitebeards were led by King [[Gundulph Whitebeard VII]].",
        "Defenses": "Whitestone was guarded by a fleet of huge [[stone ship]]s.",
        "History": "Sometime in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the crew of one of the mining ships was captured and held hostage by a crew of pirates from a marooned [[nautiloid]] that had crash-landed on the [[Neverwinter River]] after a battle with one of the stone warships that guarded Whitestone."
