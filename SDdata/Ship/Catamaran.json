        "mainbody": "Catamarans were a type of watercraft design that used twinned hulls instead of one, and could scale from small boats to large ships.\nBy using two hulls together, a catamaran boat or ship achieved better stability and speed, though maneuvrability was more limited. It also suffered a lack of space inside the hull or atop the deck, reducing its capacity for passengers or cargo.\n* The naval catamarans of Evermeet were fast boats carried by their larger warships, and were used for scouting and light combat duties.\n* Flying catamarans were delicate craft used as pleasure boats in low orbit or as launches from larger spelljammers.\n* A small catamaran boat was used by Mhair in service of the secret cell of Sharrans at the Temple of Mystra."
