The Wicked Wench was a small fishing and transport sailing ship in the Ten-Towns, active in the early 14 century DR.
The Wicked Wench was a small ship that could navigate the rivers of Icewind Dale as well as the ocean. It had a single mast and carried two small fishing boats attached to the ships rear, which could also serve as life boats if needed.
The ship sailed under the command of Hedron Kerdoss father many years before the early 14 century DR. It received its name from Hedrons mother â€“ Firtha Kerdos, a harpy of a woman, whom the old captain called Umberlees favorite daughter. With the passing of his father, the captains helm was passed to Hedron. Around the , the Wicked Wench sailed the waters of Maer Dualdon, the Shaengarne River, and even the Sea of Moving Ice and the Sea of Swords.
In Mirtul of 1312 DR, the vessel was among several ships that carried reinforcements of hired adventurers and mercenaries from the city of Luskan to Targos, to aid the town against the Legion of the Chimera. As they approached Maer Dualdon, the ships were ambushed by goblin and orc Legion troops who had already sacked the town of Bremen. Many ships were set aflame and sunk, but the Wicked Wench managed to escape and reach Targos unharmed.
The ship carried a group of adventurers who would later become the heroes of the Ten-Towns. Captain Hedron offered them sleeping quarters on the Wicked Wench, as Speaker Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos had hired the ship to stay in port in case the town fell and survivors needed evacuation.
