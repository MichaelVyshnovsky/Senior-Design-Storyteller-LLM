The '''''Wicked Wench''''' was a small fishing and transport sailing ship in the [[Ten-Towns]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Wicked Wench'' was a small ship that could navigate the rivers of [[Icewind Dale]] as well as the ocean. It had a single mast and carried two small fishing boats attached to the ship's rear, which could also serve as life boats if needed.

==History==
The ship sailed under the command of [[Hedron Kerdos]]'s father many years before the early 14{{th}} century DR. It received its name from Hedron's mother – [[Firtha Kerdos]], a [[harpy]] of a woman, whom the old captain called [[Umberlee]]'s favorite daughter. With the passing of his father, the captain's helm was passed to Hedron. Around the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''Wicked Wench'' sailed the waters of [[Maer Dualdon]], the [[Shaengarne River]], and even the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] and the [[Sea of Swords]].

In [[Mirtul]] of 1312 DR, the vessel was among several ships that carried reinforcements of hired adventurers and mercenaries from the city of [[Luskan]] to [[Targos]], to aid the town against the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. As they approached Maer Dualdon, the ships were ambushed by [[goblin]] and [[orc]] Legion troops who had already sacked the town of [[Bremen]]. Many ships were set aflame and sunk, but the ''Wicked Wench'' managed to escape and reach Targos unharmed.

The ship carried a group of adventurers who would later become the heroes of the Ten-Towns. Captain Hedron offered them sleeping quarters on the ''Wicked Wench'', as Speaker [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of Targos had hired the ship to stay in port in case the town fell and survivors needed evacuation.
