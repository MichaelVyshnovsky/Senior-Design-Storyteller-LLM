It became a cursed spectral ghost ship bound to the Domains of Dread.\nUrdogens violent raiding led to a a great naval battle on Eleint 11, 1209 DR, when the navies of Cormyr, Impiltur, Aglarond, Sembia, and the Vilhon Reach united to end his threat. Eventually losing the battle, Urgoden fled while raging against the gods and swearing eternal vengeance on his enemies. A strange mist rose about the ship, transporting it, the crew, and Urdogen to the Domains of Dread. Urdogen transformed into a specter and then shared his curse with the crew, becoming one of the Domains lesser Dark Lords as he terrorised its inhabitants. The ship regularly returned to the Inner Sea on foggy, moonless nights, and predated upon any ships they could catch, only to vanish before dawnbreak."
