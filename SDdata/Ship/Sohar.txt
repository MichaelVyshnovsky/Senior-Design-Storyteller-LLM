'''Sohars''' were a type of ship commonly used by [[Calishite]]s to ship goods.

==Description==
On average, from bow to stern these ships measured {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} in length, had a beam (width) of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}, and required a depth of at least {{SI|4|ft}} in order to float.

Sohars sported three masts but the average number of crew one could find on a sohar would be around eight individuals. The bare minimum of individuals needed to sail a sohar were four.
