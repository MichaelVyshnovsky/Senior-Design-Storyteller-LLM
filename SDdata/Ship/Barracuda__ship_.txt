Barracuda was a smuggler frigate allied with Zhentarim, active circa 1372 DR.
In 1372 DR, Zhentarim hatched a nefarious plan to take over the city of Daggerford by installing a puppet leader, Baron Matagar Bugo, and staging a winnable war to cement his rule and approval. Part of this plan included bribing the Mariners Alliance and using the Shoreside Shipping Consortiums target to transport army equipment via Delimbiyr River and through Daggerford into the hands of the orc horde that was to attack the city. Barracuda under the leadership of Captain Herab was routinely loaded up with illicit goods under cover of the night and transported the supplies to the hidden pirate cove along the Crabs Claw Coast and into the hordes hands.
One of such operations was witnessed by Captain Samuel Turgat, whose boat, the Flyingfish, was docked for repairs at the time. This information attracted the attention of the adventurer later known as the Hero of Daggerford who was untangling many plots that menaced the city alongside a Harper agent Astriel Shalyn.
The hero was confronted by a duo of half-orcish crew-members guarding the ship, Wierdnog, Nobla. There were several accounts on how the adventurer gained access to the Captains cabin past the half-orcs. Some claimed the hero slaughtered them, but others told a story of the heros cunning use of a sleep-induced brew, possibly Fillians Brew, to incapacitate the sailors.
Inside, the Hero of Daggerford discovered Captain Herabs oiled leather-bound ledger on his massive oak desk. The black book listed all the goods Barracuda smuggled, including splint mail, leather jerkins, spears, and halberds. The Captain was paid in gold and able-bodied slaves. The ledger also pointed to the location of the orcs base along the Crabs Claw Coast, the adventurers next goal.
