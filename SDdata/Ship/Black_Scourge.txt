The '''''Black Scourge''''' was the [[skyship]] captained by the self-styled Pirate Kin [[Bartholomew Blackdagger]], leader of a crew of sky pirates in [[Pirates' Skyhold]] that terrorized the [[Sword Coast North]] and the [[Sea of Swords]] for over ten years in the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The ''Black Scourge'' lived up to its name in the years leading up to and for the decade that followed the {{YearlinkName|1429}}. Following the Blackdagger crew's decade-long career, the ship was moored at the Pirates' Skyhold at the [[Pirate King's Retreat]] and did not see flight for at least another 50 years. Captain Blackdagger, his lieutenants and his remaining crew were cursed by the [[black dragon]] [[Garrundar]], bound to their strongholds for eternity and made unable to leave the flying isle and engage in piracy.

It was finally recovered in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, when the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] raided the Pirate King's Retreat and defeated Blackdagger once and for all. The adventurers gained access to the skyhold by the efforts of [[Company Yargo]], a mercenary company that was looking to expand their fleet of skyships. The final fate of the ''Black Scourge'' was unknown.
