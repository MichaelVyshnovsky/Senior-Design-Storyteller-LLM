Mhairs kayak was a personal watercraft operated by Mhair, a riverine boating enthusiast.
The kayak was a sleek craft made from polished wood, propelled along by a double-sided paddle.
Mhair kept his kayak for personal use while using his catamaran to transport prisoners. He kept both in a secret boathouse beneath the Sharran Temple of Mystra in Wheloon, connected to the Wyvernflow river via an underground passage.
