        "mainbody": "The '''''Bloody Umber''''' was a \"sailrig\" [[coaster]], essentially a large raft outfitted with a trisail, that shipped goods throughout the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and the [[Dragonmere]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[Ches]] of [[1357 DR]], the ''Bloody Umber'' sailed from [[the Neck]] of the Dragonmere north to [[Harrowdale]] on the coast of the [[Dragon Reach]]. It was carrying a mix of goods such as pottery, clothes, rugs, live hogs, and poultry, as well as [[iron]]ware, including [[axe]]heads and [[arrow]]s for the armed forces of [[Scardale]]. Unfortunately, it never reached its destination and was never heard from since."
