        "History": "Sometime before 1372 DR, a young and impressionable librarian was inspired by the book ''[[Turgat's Revene]]'', legally changed his name to [[Samuel Turgat]], and used his inheritance to purchase this vessel. Since then, the boat traveled across the [[Sea of Swords]], often stopping in [[Daggerford]]. In 1372 DR, the vessel suffered some damage and was forced to dock for repairs in Daggerford. While the crew was on a shore leave, Captain Turgat witnessed a shady dealings abroad a fellow docked vessel ''[[Barracuda (ship)|Barracuda]]'' that was loaded up with goods exclusively late at night away from prying eyes.\n\nOne of the goods the ''Flyingfish'' traded in were [[barrel]]s of aerobatic and delectable [[Trulit & Greegon's claret]]."
