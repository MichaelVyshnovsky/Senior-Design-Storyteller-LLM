Also called '''dragon ships''' for the carved figureheads they usually had mounted, they were appreciated by true Northmen beyond other property or family, and were never used as anything but a warship. Longships were the fastest ships along the [[Sword Coast]] in most weather, and were crewed by 40 men, each one a warrior."
