        "Description": "Each sidewheeler was unique in design. Gnomes put their own individuality and practicality in their construction and repair, adding and salvaging new parts as needed, so over time a sidewheeler also gradually changed its appearance. The [[spelljamming helm]]s on these ships were usually grandiose constructions, which the crew also tinkered with constantly.\n\n[[Giant space hamster]]s were used to power the side wheels of these spelljamming craft, which is how they created propulsion for non-spelljamming speeds. Large running wheels powered by the hamsters wound up giant rubber bands, which stored the energy. The hamsters would run for hours at a time in this role. Before the gnome research committee invented giant space hamsters, gnomes ran on the wheels.\n\nBecause of their unstable construction, sidewheelers were usually ill-suited for landing on the ground or staying afloat on water. Since the chance of accident was high, sidewheeler crews either never landed or sometimes prepared to brace the ship together with improvised material. In other cases, they simply allowed the ship to crash and then rebuilt another one from the wreckage.\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| text   = We don't know why the [[Lizardfolk|lizard man]] was so upset.
