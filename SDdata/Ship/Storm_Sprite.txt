The '''''Storm Sprite''''' was a sailing ship that braved the seas of the [[Dragonmere]] and [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was captained by the [[half-orc]] sea captain named [[Fowler]].

==Description==
The {{SI|40|ft}} long [[cog]] had sails made of [[flax]].

==Defense==
The ''Storm Sprite'' boasted three [[ballista]]e that could be loaded with barbed [[harpoon]]s, and its crew were armed with boarding [[axe]]s and [[spear]]s of their own.<ref name="VD-p8-12 />

==History==
While the ship's previous owner was unknown, it was obtained by Captain Fowler by means of theft.

In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the [[Harper]] agent [[Ruha]] hired Captain Fowler and the ''Storm Sprite'' out of [[Cormyr]], to transport her to town of [[Pros]] along the [[Dragon Coast]]. During their voyage, Ruha witnessed [[Ginger Lady|another ship]] being attacked at sea by a [[Hethcypressarvil|black dragon]], and urged Captain Fowler to come to their aid.<ref name="VD-p8-12> While Ruha was able to use her [[arcane magic]] to destroy the creature, the ''Storm Sprite'' was splintered apart in the process.<ref name="VD-p21-25>
