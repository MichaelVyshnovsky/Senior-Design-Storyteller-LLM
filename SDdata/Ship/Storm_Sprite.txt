The Storm Sprite was a sailing ship that braved the seas of the Dragonmere and Sea of Fallen Stars during the midâ€“14 century DR. It was captained by the half-orc sea captain named Fowler.
The  long cog had sails made of flax.
The Storm Sprite boasted three ballistae that could be loaded with barbed harpoons, and its crew were armed with boarding axes and spears of their own.
While the ships previous owner was unknown, it was obtained by Captain Fowler by means of theft.
In the , the Harper agent Ruha hired Captain Fowler and the Storm Sprite out of Cormyr, to transport her to town of Pros along the Dragon Coast. During their voyage, Ruha witnessed another ship being attacked at sea by a black dragon, and urged Captain Fowler to come to their aid. While Ruha was able to use her arcane magic to destroy the creature, the Storm Sprite was splintered apart in the process.
