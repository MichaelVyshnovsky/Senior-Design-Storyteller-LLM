        "mainbody": "The Cutter was a seal-hunting ship based near the Sea of Moving Ice.\nIt was captained by Farlow, a black-bearded mercenary.\nIn 1361 DR, the ship, carrying the secret Lord of Waterdeep Caladorn Cassalanter, ran into an abandoned ship holding barrels of pickled sea elves. The crew planned to bring the news to the Lords of Waterdeep, but they were intercepted by the Elfmaid and scuttled before they could explain. The crew was set adrift and the surviving crewmembers were rescued by the sea elf Xzorsh."
