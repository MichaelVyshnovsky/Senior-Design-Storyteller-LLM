        "mainbody": "he Krigvind, meaning Warwind in the language of giants, was the flagship of the frost giant Jarl Storvald during the late 15 century DR.\nThe Krigvind was well over 500 feet (152.4 meters) long and boasted a mast over 200 feet (61 meters) tall. Atop the mast was the ships sail, which was in fact a pennant of the vind rune. While the Krigvind required at least 20 giants to set sail to comfortably held twice that number.\nIt was essentially a floating fortress, and could not be damaged by armaments less-powerful than siege weapons.\nThe Krigvind had four giant-sized ballistae that sat atop swiveling bases, two at each end of the ship.\nAfter the Ordning was destroyed in the late 15 century, the frost giant Jarl Storvald sailed the Krigvind to reclaim the abandoned giant fortress of Svardborg.\nAfter Storvald reclaimed the fortress, he used the dragon eggs he found to blackmail the mated white dragons Cryovain and Isendraug. The Jarl chained Cryovain to the deck of the Krigvind and used him to defend the ship."
