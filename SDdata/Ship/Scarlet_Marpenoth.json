        "mainbody": "The '''''Scarlet Marpenoth''''' was a [[submarine]] secretly owned by [[Jarlaxle Baenre]]. It was named for the month of [[Marpenoth]].",
        "Description": "The ''Scarlet Marpenoth'' was a red vehicle shaped like a [[manta ray]].\n\nThe submarine had a top speed of 2 mph (3.2 km/h) and required a minimum crew of two in order to be properly piloted and kept. Its interior was always kept dark, so that its crew had to rely on [[darkvision]]. The ship was maintained by a crew of [[rock gnome]] engineers and run by a [[drow]] crew under Jarlaxle's command.\n\nThe ship's air supply circulated between all its chambers through a complex ventilation system powered by quasi-magical machinery. Its airtight doors were kept always locked.\n\nThe ''Scarlet Marpenoth's'' engine was a quasi-magical device that controlled the ship's depth, as well as the steering fins and rudder, and powered its propulsion system. It could be piloted from the ship's control room.\n\nThe ship had a defense system that allowed its outer hull to become electrified for a short period of time.",
        "History": "According to a commemorative plaque in the [[House of Inspired Hands]], the submersible was launched in [[1489 DR]].\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], one year before the arrival of the [[Sea Maidens Faire]] in [[Waterdeep]], the submarine was acquired by Jarlaxle and was kept secret even to the crews of the Faire's sailing ships.{{Waterdeep-time}}"
