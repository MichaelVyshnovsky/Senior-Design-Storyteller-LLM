        "mainbody": "he Scarlet Marpenoth was a submarine secretly owned by Jarlaxle Baenre. It was named for the month of Marpenoth.\nThe Scarlet Marpenoth was a red vehicle shaped like a manta ray.\nThe submarine had a top speed of 2 mph (3.2 km/h) and required a minimum crew of two in order to be properly piloted and kept. Its interior was always kept dark, so that its crew had to rely on darkvision. The ship was maintained by a crew of rock gnome engineers and run by a drow crew under Jarlaxles command.\nThe ships air supply circulated between all its chambers through a complex ventilation system powered by quasi-magical machinery. Its airtight doors were kept always locked.\nThe Scarlet Marpenoths engine was a quasi-magical device that controlled the ships depth, as well as the steering fins and rudder, and powered its propulsion system. It could be piloted from the ships control room.\nThe ship had a defense system that allowed its outer hull to become electrified for a short period of time.\nAccording to a commemorative plaque in the House of Inspired Hands, the submersible was launched in 1489 DR.\nIn 1491 DR, one year before the arrival of the Sea Maidens Faire in Waterdeep, the submarine was acquired by Jarlaxle and was kept secret even to the crews of the Faires sailing ships."
