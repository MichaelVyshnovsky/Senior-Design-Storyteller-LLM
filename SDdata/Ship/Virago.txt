Zazesspur, Tethyr
The Virago was a mercantile ship that operated out of Zazesspur in Tethyr during the midâ€“15 century DR.
A charred husk was all that remained of the Virago decades after its last voyage.
Some time around the 1450s DR, the Virago was assailed by pirates in the waters near Chult and navigated into a fiery cloud of ash that wafted from a nearby volcano. The ship caught fire and floated across the ocean ablaze for days. It eventually drifted onto the beach of the Snout of Omgar at the base of High Horn.
