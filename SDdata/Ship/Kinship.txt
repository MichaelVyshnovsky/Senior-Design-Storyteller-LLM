'''''Kinship''''' was a shipping vessel, based out of [[Baldur's Gate]] and operating in the [[Sea of Swords]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Kinship'' sailed from and to Baldur's Gate, transporting goods from the [[Moonshae Isles]]. During one of the ship's voyages, it passed through one of the Moonshae straits, where it became the target of the Birth Queen [[Umberlee]]'s fickle nature. The goddess's wrath pummelled the prow of the ship, claiming the lives of two sailors. Once the victims of her wrath were drowned in Umberlee's [[salt]]y depths, the storm calmed, allowing ''Kinship'' to pass.

The incident was included in a report submitted to the priestesses of the [[Water Queen's House]] in Baldur's Gate. The author of the note suspected that on the ship's next voyage, it would likely avoid the same route and the Queen's wrath, only to face the dangers of a lesser-known and longer naval route.
