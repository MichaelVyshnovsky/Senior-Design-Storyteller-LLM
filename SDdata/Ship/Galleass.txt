The galleass was a large type of ship that resembled a cross between a galley and a galleon.
Galleasses were extremely large ships that had both sails and rowers, with the intent to have the seaworthiness and strength of a galleon and the speed and agility of a galley. Despite these ambitions, the galley-derived form meant that it lacked the stability for true oceanic travel.
When under sail, the galleass was much more sluggish than other sailships, but its rowers could bring it up to a respectable speed that was even more pronounced in adverse wind conditions that would cripple other ships.
A galleass could make good use of its speed and maneuverability with its ship ram, and would easily fit ballistae on the deck.
Galleasses had very large cargo holds, and so worked best as merchant ships along coastal waters, but could still be used as warships when equipped with large marine detachments.
