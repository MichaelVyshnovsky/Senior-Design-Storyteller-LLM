        "mainbody": "Radiant ships were flying spelljammer ships of elven design. They were as bright as suns and were used to illuminate elven fleets in the darkness of wildspace.\nThe entire hulls of radiant ships were enchanted with continual light spells. They were so bright that their crews needed to wear special goggles known as goggles of darkness to be able to see while on board without going blind. Thanks to this extreme brightness, radiant ships were also extraordinarily difficult to target by enemy attackers.\nRadiant ships needed a minimum crew of four to operate. The maximum compliment a radiant ship could hold without compromising its air supply was 25 individuals.\nRadiant ships were first developed in Krynnspace and Greyspace as prototypes. They started serving the elven fleet at large not long before the midâ€’14 century DR."
