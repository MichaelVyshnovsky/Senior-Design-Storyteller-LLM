        "mainbody": "'''Radiant ships''' were flying [[spelljammer]] ships of [[elf|elven]] design. They were as bright as suns and were used to illuminate elven fleets in the darkness of [[wildspace]].",
        "Description": "The entire hulls of radiant ships were enchanted with ''[[continual light]]'' spells. They were so bright that their crews needed to wear special goggles known as ''[[goggles of darkness]]'' to be able to see while on board without going blind. Thanks to this extreme brightness, radiant ships were also extraordinarily difficult to target by enemy attackers.\n\nRadiant ships needed a minimum crew of four to operate. The maximum compliment a radiant ship could hold without compromising its air supply was 25 individuals.",
        "History": "Radiant ships were first developed in [[Krynnspace]] and [[Greyspace]] as prototypes. They started serving the elven fleet at large not long before the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
