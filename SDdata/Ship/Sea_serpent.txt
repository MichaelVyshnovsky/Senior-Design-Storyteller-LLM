The '''''Sea Serpent''''' was the finest merchant's ship on the [[Dragon Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Sea Serpent'' was a swift ship that could outrun any pirate vessel of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and the [[Dragonmere]]. The ship's valuable cargo was safe from being plundered, as it could outrun anything, short of an actual [[sea serpent]], given favorable winds.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the ''Sea Serpent'' transported an unnamed hero who somehow came to possess a mysterious artifact that had a connection to the infamous [[Night Masks]] of Westgate. The ship's first mate, a bearded [[human]] male, warned the more of the recent guild war between the Masks and the [[Ebon Claws]] that created unrest in the city of late. He also informed the adventurer that [[Obid Teltas]] of the [[Church of Lathander]] and the [[Morningstar Haven]] temple declared his intent to clean Westgate but lacked manpower. The first mate speculated that Obid was likely searching for hirelings to aid with the cleanup.
