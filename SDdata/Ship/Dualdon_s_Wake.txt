'''''Dualdon's Wake''''' was a small but important cargo ship from the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Dualdon's Wake'' was a long two-masted cargo ship with its name proudly inscribed on the hull.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''Dualdon's Wake'' sailed the waters of [[Maer Dualdon]] and the [[Shaengarne River]]. When Targos became besieged by the [[goblin]] and [[orc]] forces of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Dualdon's Wake'' was used to transport lumber from [[Lonelywood]] to Targos for the construction of defensive palisades. The ship was targeted by goblin arsonists trying to cripple Targos by destroying its docks, but the invaders were slaughtered by a group of adventurers from [[Luskan]], and the ship was defended by a member of the [[Targos Guard]] named [[Crandall]].
