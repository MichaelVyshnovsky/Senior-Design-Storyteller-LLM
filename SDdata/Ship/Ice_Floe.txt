The Ice Floe was a galley owned by the dragonborn captain Kristoffen. The ship plied the Sea of Swords in the late 15 century DR, hauling goods for merchants as well as passengers.
The Ice Floe was a galley specifically equipped for the frigid seas of the far north.
Circa 1491 DR, Valdi Estapaar, who was a member of the Leilon town council, was looking to hire a ship to transport a group of adventurers to the Thunder Cliff Caves. The caves at the foot of the Thunder Cliffs were used as a hideout by the Cult of Talos, which had previously attacked Leilon, and were only accessible by sea. The Ice Floe competed with the Dancing Delight for the job. Secretly, the captain of the Ice Floe, Kristoffen, was a follower of Talos himself. However, he couldnt stop the adventurers from defeating the cultists in the caves.
Around the same time, the crew of the Ice Floe was dissatisfied since their captain had been acting strangely in recent months. To stay closer to Neverwinter, he had declined much more lucrative contracts to travel northwest to the Moonshae Isles. This had resulted in lower remuneration for the crew, which they were unhappy about. The reason for Kristoffens unusual behavior was his secret membership in the Cult of Talos, which operated around Neverwinter. The crews dissatisfaction eventually led to a mutiny.
