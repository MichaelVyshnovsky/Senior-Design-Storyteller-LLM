A '''sambuk''' was a sailing ship with a single, triangular sail. It was a type of [[dhow]].

==Description==
A sambuk typically had a keel length of around {{SI|75|ft|long=yes}} long and had a beam or width of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. Rather than a sterncastle, it had only a raised platform. Navigation was via a rudder at the stern and the [[lateen]] sails. It was slightly more reliable than a [[barijah]], as it could be sailed in all seas.

A sambuk was crewed by 15â€“20 sailors and could carry 80 passengers or {{SI|90|ton|k|long=yes}}.

==In Zakhara==
The sambuk was the second-most common ship in Zakhara after the barijah.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|657}}, the [[Grand Caliph]] [[Arash bint Sanjar]] sent an armada of sambuks to the [[Utter East]]. From these vessels, the [[corsair (kit)|corsairs]] launched a surprise attack on the Five Kingdoms, swiftly overrunning and seizing their defenseless port cities. Then legions of [[askar]] disembarked, beginning the [[Scouring of the Utter East]]. By the end, his forces boarded their sambuks and sailed home again.
