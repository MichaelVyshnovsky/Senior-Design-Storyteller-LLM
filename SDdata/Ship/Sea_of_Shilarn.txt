The '''''Sea of Shilarn''''' was a famous ship of [[Waterdeep]] on the [[Sea of Swords]] from the city's early maritime history. It was named for [[Shilarn Silmaeril]], one of the early [[Lords of Waterdeep]].<ref>

By the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a beautiful and detailed model of the ''Sea of Shilarn'' was displayed in the hall of ships in the [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in Waterdeep.
