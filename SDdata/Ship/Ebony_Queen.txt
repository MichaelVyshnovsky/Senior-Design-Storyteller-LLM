The '''''Ebony Queen''''' was a legendary magical ship capable that traveled between all of the [[genie]] realms on the [[Elemental planes]], and to [[Qudra]] and the [[Pearl Cities]] of [[Zakhara]], and to other lands of [[Toril]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was sailed by the famous Captain [[Soot (captain)|Soot]], who was highly respected by the genies.

==Description==
It was a type of [[dhow]] called a [[baghla]]. It had black sails and the entire ship was made from [[ebony]] wood. It was equipped with an ''[[orrery of the Inner Planes]]''.

==Crew==
Serving under Captain Soot, the crew of the ''Ebony Queen'' numbered thirty-three and was composed of four [[jann]] lookouts, twenty-two reformed [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]], five [[sea wolf]] scouts, and two [[sea mage]]s, female [[gnome]]s named [[Senoon]] and [[Unfuwa]]. For marines, there were thirty [[amazon]]s, who were noted to be related to the [[Anaconda (organization)|Anaconda Company]] hailing from [[Katashaka]]; these warrior women used similar tactics and weaponry.

==Activities==
The ''Ebony Queen'' conducted trade between Qudra and the Pearl Cities in Zakhara, lands outside Zakhara, and the genie realms on the elemental planes, However, its prices were as expensive as such power warranted: for passage, fares began at 200 [[gp]] per person, while for freight the cost was 300 gp per cubic foot (0.0283 m<sup>3</sup>) of cargo.

==History==
In [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} Captain Soot and the ''Ebony Queen'' had to beat a quick departure from the City of Brass.
