        "mainbody": "The '''''Morkoth''''' was a sailing ship that was used by the [[Kraken Society]] to hold the [[storm giant]] [[Hekaton|King Hekaton]] captive in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ''Morkoth'' had an odd-looking hull that resembled a [[giant squid]].",
        "History": "Some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] of [[1485 DR]], the [[Kraken Society]] used the ''Morkoth'' as a mobile prison for the storm giant King Hekaton. The ship regularly circled the [[Purple Rocks]] in the [[Trackless Sea]].\n\nAfter the Kraken Society agent Lord [[Khaspere Drylund]] betrayed the location of the ''Morkoth'' to adventurers, the [[kraken]] [[Slarkrethel]] decided to destroy the ship rather than allow Hekaton to be rescued.",
        "Features": "[[File:Morkoth_decks-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|''Top and starboard views and deck plan of the ''Morkoth''.'']]\nDue to a spell cast on the ship by Slarkrethel, neither the ship nor anyone aboard it could be targeted by any form of [[divination]] magic or perceived through magical [[scrying]] sensors.",
        "Crew": "The [[archmage]] [[Tholtz Daggerdark]] captained the ''Morkoth'', while the [[half-orc]] [[assassin]] [[Rool]] served as his first mate. Twenty Kraken Society [[cultist]]s crewed the vessel, while four [[merrow]] loyal to Slarkrethel escorted the vessel in the water."
