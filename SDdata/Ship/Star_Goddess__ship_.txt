The '''''Star Goddess''''' was a ''[[Halruaan skyship]]'' that sailed the skies during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Crew==
The ''Star Goddess'' was captained by the [[Halruaan]] [[Thasselandra Bravewing]]. Other crew members included the ship's navigator [[Ra-das]], the master-of-arms [[Faix Haranis]], [[Oloma Authdamar]] and three other crewmen, [[Brax]], [[Nhar]], and [[Veloid]].

==History==
Some time the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the ''Star Goddess'' and its crew took to the skies from [[Halruaa]] to explore the nearby jungles of [[Chult]]. While flying over the peninsula, it was assailed by a flock of [[pterafolk]]. They tore open the vessel's blimp and sent it crashing to the tree canopy of the jungles.

Most of the survivors were left marooned, high above the ground beneath them. One of them, Oloma Authdamar, managed to leap from the crashing ''skyship'', but was later captured by the [[yuan-ti]] of [[Omu]].
