Dragonships were large rowed warships used by the Evermeet navy.
These vessels were  long and  wide, propelled by sails and oars. Dragonships had heavily decorated hardwood hulls carved with runes and totemic images, and large, colorful, magical sails.
Dragonships were roughly analogous to Northlander longships, having 40 crew and up to 135 extra soldiers aboard, and were capable of reaching great speeds when rowed intensely. Armed with only a single heavy catapult, they were most often used to ambush enemy ships or suddenly land warriors into battle ashore. They also carried up to three catamarans that could be dropped into the water, and worked alongside the swanships and wardragons of the fleet.
