        "Description": {
            "Form": "[[File:Infernal War Machine Blood War.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Infernal war machines were just one of the many weapons the endless arsenals of the Nine Hells.'']]\nInfernal war machines were constructed of [[infernal iron]] and adorned with massive spikes, bladed weapons, and in some cases, massive siege weaponry. Just like more mundane mechanical vehicles, they could be repaired by a skilled mechanic, over the course of some hours.\n\nTheir inner machinery included a furnace, that processed damned souls as fuel, and an engine that translated that fuel into mechanical energy.",
            "Function": "Infernal war machines were constructed to fulfill various roles in battle, specifically for [[baatezu]] and other devils to gain advantages against [[demon]]s of the [[Abyss]] in the [[Blood War]]. Smaller war machines were built to be used on scouting missions or to transport raiding parties, while others were built as mobile siege platforms or for the primary purpose of mowing down hordes of demonic minions.",
            "Armor, Gadgetry, & Weapons": "War machines could be made nigh-indestructible with armor crafted from iron mined in [[Cania]],\n\nSome were even equipped with magical smoke screen devices that utilized [[necrotic energy]], or ''[[teleport]]ers'' that could transport the entire vehicle and everyone aboard upwards of {{SI|300|ft}} once per day.\n\nThey were often outfitted with terrible weapons of war imagined by the most devious of the Hells' fiendish inventors. Notable among these were:\n* '''Acidic bile sprayer''', a hose-and-nozzle weapon that showered enemies in the corrosive bile of some unknown creature(s).\n* '''Flamethrower''', the weapon station that spewed forth jets of flame that ignited any flammable foes or material.\n* '''Harpoon fingers''', cannons that fired massive harpoons towards targets upwards of {{SI|120|ft}} away.\n* '''Infernal screamer''', a humanoid-shaped figure of wax constructed with a hand crank that inflicted terrible telepathic pain upon anyone nearby.\n* '''Styx sprayer''', another form of weaponry that showered foes in caustic liquids, utilizing water pumped out of the [[River Styx]]."

        "Operations": "An infernal war machine was controlled by its helm, a typical vehicle seat surrounded by a series of pedals, levers, and steering mechanism. A war machine without a driver would remain on its current course and speed until stopped by some other force.\n\nThe engine of an infernal war machine each possessed a receptacle in which ''[[soul coin]]s'' could be inserted. The soul trapped within the coin was immediately siphoned into the machine's furnace, processed into power, and destroyed within a matter of days. Liquid [[demon ichor]] could be applied directly into the furnace to bolster performance. While operational, the engine of the war machine resonated with the sonorous rumble, underscored with screams of agony.\n\nDespite their unique power source and quasi-magical nature, infernal war machines were incapable of acting directly on their own and required a crew to be piloted, and its weaponry to be manned. Excessive wear and tear on their machinery could lead to outright failure. Similarly, war machines could be immediately shut down by use of [[antimagic field]]s or other magic-nullifying effects.",
        "History": "After components of the ''[[Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad]]'' were recovered, the archdevils [[Bel]] and [[Zariel]] both had their minions attempt to convert the [[artifact]] into an exceptionally powerful infernal war machine.\n\n[[File:DiA DM screen.jpg|thumb|center|750px|''Avernus warlords [[Bitter Breath]] and [[Smiler|Smiler the Defiler]] using their infernal war machines to assail a band of adventurers attempting to traverse the battlefield of the Nine Hells.]]",

It was capable of high speeds and was exceptionally maneuverable.\n* [[Earth Ripper]], a huge war machine that could transport larger crews and was equipped with an enormous wrecking ball on a [[chain]].{{Cite adventurers league/Infernal Pursuits|47}} \n* [[Tormentor]], the four-wheeled vehicle that could rapidly transport small teams and carry a moderate amount of cargo.\n* [[Demon Grinder]], the massive armored vehicles of the infernal armies constructed to slay as many demons as possible in the quickest time possible.\n* [[Scavenger (infernal war machine)|Scavenger]], a bulky war machine built with a massive clawed arm used to haul damaged machines or other debris on the battlefield.",
