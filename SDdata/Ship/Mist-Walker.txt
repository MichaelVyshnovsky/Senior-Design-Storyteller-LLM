The '''''Mist-Walker''''' was the ship of Captain [[Carreigh Macumail]], one of the few [[human]] vessels permitted to travel to [[Evermeet]].

==History==
In [[1367 DR]], Carreigh abandoned his unsuccessful career as a [[pirate]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and took up a new ship and crew on the [[Sword Coast]] as a somewhat more legitimate [[adventurer]]. After a few months with the ''Mist-Walker'', he was hired by his friend [[Aerilaya]] to transport her to Evermeet on the [[Retreat]]. Along the voyage from [[Corwell]], the ''Mist-Walker'' aided a [[swanship]] being attacked by the infamous pirate [[Jaq Meadu]] and rescued the beleaguered [[elves]], took on the priestess [[Daenalaia]] and [[Eilistraee]]an emissary [[Karsel'lyn Lylyl-Lytherraias]], and finally landed at [[Leuthilspar]].
