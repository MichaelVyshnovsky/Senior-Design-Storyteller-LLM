==History==
In ancient Shou Lung, the [[Segara Sea Lords]] terrorized the harbors of [[Ahn Bay]] and [[Muara Bay]]. The governor of [[Tempat Larang]], [[Sangkal Chunbi]], finding his troops ineffective against the large fleet, decided to ask his [[wu jen]] [[Kimasogi]] for advice. Kimasogi counseled the governor to divide the pirates before attack. So Governor Chunbi sent the leader of the Segara Sea Lords, [[Chan Chiong]], a vast dragon boat loaded from stem to stern with [[gold]] and [[gemstone]]s as an offer of peace.

When the dragon boat arrived at their port, the Segara Sea Lords started arguing about how to divide the treasure. This caused a long enough distraction for Tempat Larang's troops to march upon their harbor and unleash a sneak attack.
