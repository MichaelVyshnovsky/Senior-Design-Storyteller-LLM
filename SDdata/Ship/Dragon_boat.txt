Dragon boats were a type of watercraft used in Shou Lung,
These boats varied in length from , thirty-six of which were tasked with manning the ships oars, which each measured  in length.
In ancient Shou Lung, the Segara Sea Lords terrorized the harbors of Ahn Bay and Muara Bay. The governor of Tempat Larang, Sangkal Chunbi, finding his troops ineffective against the large fleet, decided to ask his wu jen Kimasogi for advice. Kimasogi counseled the governor to divide the pirates before attack. So Governor Chunbi sent the leader of the Segara Sea Lords, Chan Chiong, a vast dragon boat loaded from stem to stern with gold and gemstones as an offer of peace.
When the dragon boat arrived at their port, the Segara Sea Lords started arguing about how to divide the treasure. This caused a long enough distraction for Tempat Larangs troops to march upon their harbor and unleash a sneak attack.
