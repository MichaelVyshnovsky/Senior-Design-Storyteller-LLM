        "Description": "''Veira's Gaze'' only surviving part was its carved and painted wooden prow. It was a figure of a woman gazing ahead of the ship.",
        "History": "Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Veira's Gaze'' belonged to the fisher and sailor named [[Donovan]], whose beloved [[Veira]] was the boat's namesake. One day, after driving too much before sailing, by some accords, Donovan and ''Veira's Gaze'' both perished in a storm over [[Maer Dualdon]]. Distraught over the sailor's death, Veira threw herself to the bottom of a cliff and became restless [[ghost]], waiting for her lost love. Many years later, ''Veira's Gaze's'' remnants were washed ashore, and its carved prow was displayed in the [[The Salty Dog Tavern]] as late as 1312 DR.\n\nSome stories claimed that a group of heroes from Targos delivered the painted prow back to the weeping ghost, granting her piece, shortly after a fateful [[goblin]] attack on the Ten-Towns."
