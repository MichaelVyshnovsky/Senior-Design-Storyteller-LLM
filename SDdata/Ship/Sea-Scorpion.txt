The '''''Sea-Scorpion''''' was the personal ship of [[Immurk the Invincible]], the legendary [[pirate]].

==History==
In the year [[1201 DR]], Immurk was caught in a battle with a [[Sembian]] warship while navigating a reef-filled passage. A sudden crosswind threatened to blow the ''Sea-Scorpion'' aground the reefs where it would be helpless, but Immurk managed to hold the ship on course while bellowing curses at the gods and commands at his crew. Through his strength and skill the ''Sea-Scorpion'' passed to safety, but Immurk himself died at the helm, his heart burst from the exertion.
