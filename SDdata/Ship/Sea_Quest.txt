The Sea Quest was a huge dromond and part of the Wraith of the Inner Sea privateer fleet in the midâ€“14 century DR. Based out of Reth, the fleet prowled the Chessentan coast, the Wizards Reach, and Inner Sea.
By 1357 DR, it was captained by Sturion and its first mate was Perithor. It had a complement of two-hundred crewmembers, fifty marines, and two or seven wizards.
It was a fast attack vessel with a ram and reinforced hull. The mages used gust of wind spells on the sails to increase speed. The Sea Quest would cut off any ship that attempt to escape the Wraith fleet.
