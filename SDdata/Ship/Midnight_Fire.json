        "mainbody": "The Midnight Fire was a smuggling ship that sailed across the Sword Coast in the late 15 century DR.\nSometime before the death of his wife in the late 15 century DR, the Harper agent named Edgin Darvis spent several months undercover aboard the vessel called the Midnight Fire. The ship often carried stowaways from port to port. One night, the Midnight Fire hit a storefront on the sea, and one of the smugglers watchmen disappeared. The crew suspected the man was swept off the vessel, yet his body was eventually found gnawed on and chewed apart in the Midnights cargo hold. It was soon revealed that a sea hag came aboard seeking to \"clean out the ship.\" The hag was slain, but it took many men and Edgin himself to end the creature."
