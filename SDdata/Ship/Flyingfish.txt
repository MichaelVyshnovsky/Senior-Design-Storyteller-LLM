The Flyingfish, also referred to as the Flying Fish, was Captain Samuel Turgats trade vessel, active circa 1372 DR.
Sometime before 1372 DR, a young and impressionable librarian was inspired by the book Turgats Revene, legally changed his name to Samuel Turgat, and used his inheritance to purchase this vessel. Since then, the boat traveled across the Sea of Swords, often stopping in Daggerford. In 1372 DR, the vessel suffered some damage and was forced to dock for repairs in Daggerford. While the crew was on a shore leave, Captain Turgat witnessed a shady dealings abroad a fellow docked vessel Barracuda that was loaded up with goods exclusively late at night away from prying eyes.
One of the goods the Flyingfish traded in were barrels of aerobatic and delectable Trulit & Greegons claret.
