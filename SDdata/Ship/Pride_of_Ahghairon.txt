The '''''Pride of Ahghairon''''' was a famous ship of [[Waterdeep]] on the [[Sea of Swords]] from the city's early maritime history. It was named for [[Ahghairon]], a former War Lord and the first [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep.<ref>

By the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a beautiful and detailed model of the ''Pride of Ahghairon'' was displayed in the hall of ships in the [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in Waterdeep.
