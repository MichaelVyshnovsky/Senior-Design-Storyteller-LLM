The Sea Urchin was a ship that sank at the Tower of Storms in the late 15 century DR.
It was about  long. Its lone mast stood over  high, and was visible above the waterline after the Sea Urchin had sunk. It lay just west of the rocky outcropping on which the Tower of Storms was perched.
The Sea Urchin sank when its crew was compelled to steer the ship onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the magic of Moesko, an anchorite of Talos. This plot was in service to the Cult of Talos, who sought to plunder ships along the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR. However, a chest containing a carefully packed statuette&mdasha  mermaid made of delicate blue quartz&mdashwas never recovered from the wreck. 
The crew perished when the ship sank, and their bodies were striped to the bone by fish and sharks, including the fearsome Daggermaw.
