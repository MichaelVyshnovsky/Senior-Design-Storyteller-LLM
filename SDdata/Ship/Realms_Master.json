The Realms Master had as a figurehead the image of Azuth, god of mages and consort of Mystra.\nFor at least some time, the Astrolabe of Nimbral was equipped to the Realms Master to facilitate Dwalimars search of artifacts on behalf of the Netyarch Zalathorm Kirkson.\nThe ship was destroyed during the Time of Troubles by Labelas Enoreth in Vartan Hai Sylvars body, who tried to use it to kill Helm at the Celestial Stairway\nLater the Ship was magically rebuilt by Labelas Enoreth after the Time of Troubles had ended, it is unclear if the Astrolabe was included in the rebuild ship.."
