        "mainbody": "The Ghost was a modified mosquito owned and piloted by Rianna Wyvernsbane, a messenger for hire from Toril.\nThe Ghost had been stripped down for maneuverability and speed. Rianna never carried any cargo aboard, and filled the tiny cargo hold instead with water for any emergencies.\nIn 1361 DR, the Ghost, piloted by Rianna as its only passenger, was en route from Garden to Dragon Rock, when it encountered a neogi deathspider, the Void Reaper. The neogi pursued the tiny craft through the asteroids of Garden and were able to cripple the vessel by damaging its starboard wing root, keel, and spelljamming helm. Rather than taking Rianna as a slave, they bribed the messenger to work undercover for them and set her and the Ghost adrift on what would be the Probes path as it entered Realmspace from the phlogiston and headed toward Toril. (They knew that the Cloak of the First Pilot was on board the Probe and were seeking it for themselves.)\nThe Probe indeed came upon the Ghost in orbit around Chandos and found Rianna sleeping inside its tiny cargo hold. They took Rianna aboard, letting her ship free to drift in wildspace, though they promised to post a salvage claim on its hull."
