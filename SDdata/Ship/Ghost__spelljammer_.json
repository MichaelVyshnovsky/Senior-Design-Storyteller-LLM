        "mainbody": "The '''''Ghost''''' was a modified [[Mosquito (spelljammer)|mosquito]] owned and piloted by [[Rianna Wyvernsbane]], a messenger for hire from [[Toril]].",
        "Description": "The ''Ghost'' had been stripped down for maneuverability and speed. Rianna never carried any cargo aboard, and filled the tiny cargo hold instead with water for any emergencies.",
        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], the ''Ghost'', piloted by Rianna as its only passenger, was ''en route'' from [[Garden]] to [[Dragon Rock]], when it encountered a [[neogi deathspider]], the ''[[Void Reaper]]''. The [[neogi]] pursued the tiny craft through the asteroids of Garden and were able to cripple the vessel by damaging its starboard wing root, keel, and spelljamming helm. Rather than taking Rianna as a slave, they bribed the messenger to work undercover for them and set her and the ''Ghost'' adrift on what would be the ''[[Probe]]'s'' path as it entered [[Realmspace]] from the [[phlogiston]] and headed toward [[Toril]]. (They knew that the ''[[Cloak of the First Pilot]]'' was on board the ''Probe'' and were seeking it for themselves.)\n\nThe ''Probe'' indeed came upon the ''Ghost'' in orbit around [[Chandos]] and found Rianna sleeping inside its tiny cargo hold. They took Rianna aboard, letting her ship free to drift in [[wildspace]], though they promised to post a salvage claim on its hull."
