The '''''New Bride''''' was the fictional, planes-hopping vessel of Captain [[The True and Impossible Adventures of Tenebrux Morrow|Tenebrux Morrow]], the protagonist of ''[[The True and Impossible Adventures of Tenebrux Morrow]]''. The daring captain led the crew of her ship on a journey that spanned the breadth of [[cosmology]] from the [[Feywild]] to the [[Shadowfell]] and beyond.

==Inhabitants==
Among the crew members of the ''New Bride'' were: 
* A unnamed [[halfling]] smith, who was offered over to an [[eladrin]] community as recompense for insulting their customs.
* Erules, a [[goblin]] tinkerer and crafted who was abandoned alone in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].
