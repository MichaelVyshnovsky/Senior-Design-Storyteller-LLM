        "Description": "These vessels were {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} wide, propelled by sails and [[oar]]s. Dragonships had heavily decorated hardwood hulls carved with runes and [[totemic image]]s, and large, colorful, magical sails.\n\nDragonships were roughly analogous to [[Northlander]] [[longship]]s, having 40 crew and up to 135 extra soldiers aboard, and were capable of reaching great speeds when rowed intensely. Armed with only a single heavy [[catapult]], they were most often used to ambush enemy ships or suddenly land warriors into battle ashore. They also carried up to three [[Catamaran (elven)|catamarans]] that could be dropped into the water, and worked alongside the [[swanship]]s and [[wardragon]]s of the fleet."
