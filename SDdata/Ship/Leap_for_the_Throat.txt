The Leap for the Throat was a pirate vessel active in Suq Bay along Dihl al-Suq in 1367 DR.
Almari bint-Kafira was the captain of the Leap for the Throat. The waters of Suq Bay were her hunting grounds and fat merchant vessels her favored prey.
In addition to the corsairs who manned the vessel, several notable mages lent magical support during raids. Michal Bluestar, Fayiz Mikali, and Safana al-Sitar proved to be a deadly asset at sea.
