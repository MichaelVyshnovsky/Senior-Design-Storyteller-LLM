        "mainbody": "The '''''Lustrous Lass''''' was a small ship that sailed the [[Sea of Swords]] from the harbors of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Crew": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Captain of the ''Lustrous Lass'' was the [[half-orcish]] woman named [[Harfang]]. Old [[elf]] named [[Dizby]] was the ship's quartermaster, [[human]] [[Jorkens]] was a mate, and [[gnome]] Penita rounded up the crew.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the crew of the ''Lustrous Lass'' sailed the ship to the [[Crone Island]], somewhere in the [[Sea of Swords]]. There, Captain Harfang made a deal with the [[hag]] who inhabited the isle – [[Gloom Crone]]. The crew, especially doom-saying Old Dizby, who was recently made the ship's quartermaster, thought the Crone Island an ill omen. Meanwhile [[Jorkens]], who was disgruntled by Captain Harfang selecting Dizby for promotion over him, made an undisclosed deal of his own in secret.\n\nThe hag promised the half-orc Captain \"enough gold to last the rest of her life,\" Harfang happily accepted. But several days later, the Captain decided to inspect the contents of the [[gold]] bags and found only six real gold coins – the rest was worthless. Harfang threw the fake gold overboard and immediately fell ill. She locked herself away in her cabin, trying to contain the [[disease]] and hiding away from sinister scratching coming from her baggage. The scratching came from a ''[[curse]]d'' [[imp]] who spread the deadly [[sea plague]], that ended the lives of the entire ''Lustrous Lass'' crew in a bit over a [[tenday]] after the deal was made.\n\nSoon after, the ''Lustrous Lass'' drifted into Baldur's Gate's docks with everyone onboard dead of sea plague. The [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries were dispatched to investigate the ship of the dead and placed a quarantine on the vessel. The Fists did not know what ended the crew's lives, a [[poison]] or a disease. They found a basket of strange rotting fruits that they thought could be the cause, while one Fist detected an aura of wickedness around the ''Lustrous Lass'', possibly becoming infected by the sea plague during investigation."
