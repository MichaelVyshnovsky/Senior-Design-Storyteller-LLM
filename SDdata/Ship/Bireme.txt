'''Biremes''' were a type of [[galley]] related to [[trireme]]s, noted for having two banks of [[oar]]s<ref> as opposed to a trireme's three banks.<ref>

==Variants==
* [[Pentekonter]], a type of bireme that sported hollowed outriggers attached to its hull.

==History==
Over the years, biremes were primarily used on [[Toril]] by the nations of [[east Faer√ªn]]. These included the navies of [[Chessenta]] and [[Unther]] in the [[Old Empires]] region,  the navy of [[Aglarond]] in the [[Unapproachable East]], and the nation of [[Chondath]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Outside of naval use, biremes originating from both Chessenta and Chondath were among the pirate vessels one could encounter in the [[Pirate Isles]] as of [[1356 DR]].

Unther's navy was once the terror of the southern [[Inner Sea]] with its fleet of a hundred warships, most of them biremes and triremes, but over the course of several years their navy was whittled down until by [[1359 DR]] it consisted of just five ships that were kept docked in the port city of [[Unthalass]].
