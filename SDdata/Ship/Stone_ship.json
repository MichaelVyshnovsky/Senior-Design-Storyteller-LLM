        "Description": "The stone ships were as their name indicates&mdash;colossal [[galley]]s made of stone. They were used by the dwarves of Delzoun for both trade and war.",
        "History": "Throughout the time period of the [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]], up to 20 stone ships were docked at the port of [[Ascore]], with about 30 more at sail on the [[Narrow Sea]].\n\nAfter the [[Fall of Netheril]], the magic of the [[phaerimm]] quickly dried up the Narrow Sea. Dozens of stone ships within the Bay of Ascore ran aground, and the crews had to be rescued by smaller vessels. The massive vessels were abandoned.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the remains of the stone ships could still be found in the ruins of Ascore, half-buried in sand east of the old docks.\n\nBy the late 15th century [[DR]], two [[blue dragon]]s, [[Anaxaster]] and [[Chezzaran]], who were children of the infamous dragon [[Iymrith]], had made separate lairs within a couple of the abandoned stone ships in Ascore's harbor."
