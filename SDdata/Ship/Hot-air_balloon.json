        "mainbody": "A '''hot-air balloon''' was a type of flying vessel in which a small craft was lifted by a large balloon or sac.",
        "Description": "It operated on the principle of using a relatively small flame to heat the air inside the balloon, making it warmer and less dense than the air outside, which caused it to become buoyant and ascend.\n\nOnce off the ground, the balloon was driven by the winds, but a skilled pilot could apply some control. In strong winds they became harder to handle, and the pilot could even completely lose control, leading to catastrophe. Moreover, the balloons were fragile and could be punctured, causing a crash.",
        "Types": {
            "Battle Balloons": "Combat [[airship]]s held aloft by a hot-air balloon were considered a proprietary vehicle by the [[adventuring company]] [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The origins of these battle balloons was kept a secret, and they were a rarely used but potent tool in the company's arsenal. While designed for battle, they were also sometimes used when speedy transportation or a mobile headquarters was needed.",
            "Carcerian Skin Balloons": "[[File:Hot-air balloon - Great Modron March.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Coincidentally, all balloons depicted on this page have faces on them somewhere.'']]\nIn the [[Carceri|Tarterian Depths of Carceri]], hot-air balloons were considered an excellent method of traveling between the orbs that made up that [[plane]]. However, these balloons were fashioned from the hides and skins of Carceri's denizens, and rumors warned that unwise travelers were also used to patch some balloons. Some of the creatures that flew in the void naturally took offense at seeing their kind's skin being used so, and were apt to attack such balloons. A typical balloon carried two persons, but some could hold up to ten passengers."

        "History": "According to [[gnome|gnomish]] legend, the god [[Nebelun|Nebelun the Meddler]] stole the tail of the [[lizardfolk]] god [[Semuanya]] while he was bathing, then skinned it and sewed it together, before inflating it with a massive set of [[bellows]], creating a hot-air balloon. With a wicker basket lashed to the bottom, Nebelun flew it around for a while, failed to crash, and landed successfully, with the thing only exploding afterward. Thereafter, the lizard tail and bellows was the symbol of Nebelun,<ref> whose aspect on [[Toril]] was borrowed by [[Gond|Gond the Wonderbringer]].<ref>\n\nDuring the unplanned [[Great Modron March]] of the planes, a group of [[adventurers]] tried to track the [[modron]]s through Carceri and sought passage between the orbs to a ''[[portal]]''. The Anarchist agent [[Aach]] offered them passage on her hot-air balloon, which was made from the skin of Carceri's [[petitioner]]s. They followed the modrons to a ''portal'' to [[Undermountain]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[drow]] used a hot-air balloon made from [[spider silk]] in the shape of a massive arachnid as they evacuated from [[Ithimir Isle]] off the coast of [[Akan√ªl]]. Webs from the balloon carried a cocoon as big as a small house, in which was transported an [[arambarium]] mother lode. Alongside it, hundreds of spiders and [[giant spider]]s carried [[ettercap]]s and [[undead]] miners and deployed webs that were caught by the winds and pulled them into the air to follow the balloon. Their destination was a ''portal'' to the [[Demonweb Pits]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies||19}}\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves hot-air balloon.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Just a big gasbag full of hot air, really.'']]\nTo promote the [[High Sun Games]] held at the [[Neverwinter arena|newly built arena]] in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 1490s [[DR]], Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] raised a hot-air balloon above the city. It had his own grinning face on it{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref> and carried a gondola resembling a [[green dragon]], with a [[lantern]] hanging from its jaws and sandbags around the sides for ballast. During the Games themselves, whilst [[Sofina]] invoked the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'', the thieves [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Doric]] placed a ''portal'' from their ''[[hither-thither staff]]'' on the balloon, over the image of Forge's mouth, so that it would spew treasure over the streets of Neverwinter, thereby leading the spectators out of the arena and to safety."
