Tyrs Strike was a vipership that served as the flagship of the Emerald Brotherhood, an adventuring company active in the inner region of Realmspace in the midâ€’14 century DR.
The weaponry aboard Tyrs Strike was magically enhanced. Its catapult was armed with a supply of mage shots that was constantly replenished. Its forward ballista was also enchanted for increased accuracy. However, the ships jettison was removed and its location was converted into an additional cabin.
Tyrs Strike was powered by a major helm.
The vipership was bought from an arcane who had been a captive of the neogi at the same time as the members of the Emerald Brotherhood. The companys escape from captivity, which also resulted in the destruction of that entire cell of the neogi slaving operation, made them notorious throughout Realmspace.
The mere sight of Tyrs Strike brought fear to the neogi and other slavers.
The captain of Tyrs Strike was Gehrm, a paladin of Tyr. The spelljamming helm was operated by Kalia, a cleric of Tyr and Gehrms wife. The grey elf brothers Dairn and Zadfraq completed the crew.
