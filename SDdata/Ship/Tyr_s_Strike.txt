'''''Tyr's Strike''''' was a [[vipership]] that served as the flagship of the [[Emerald Brotherhood]], an adventuring company active in the inner region of [[Realmspace]] in the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The weaponry aboard ''Tyr's Strike'' was magically enhanced. Its [[catapult]] was armed with a supply of [[mage shot]]s that was constantly replenished. Its forward [[ballista]] was also enchanted for increased accuracy. However, the ship's jettison was removed and its location was converted into an additional cabin.

''Tyr's Strike'' was powered by a [[major helm]].

==History==
The vipership was bought from an [[Arcane (race)|arcane]] who had been a captive of the [[neogi]] at the same time as the members of the Emerald Brotherhood. The company's escape from captivity, which also resulted in the destruction of that entire cell of the neogi slaving operation, made them notorious throughout Realmspace.

==Rumors & Legends==
The mere sight of ''Tyr's Strike'' brought fear to the neogi and other slavers.

==Inhabitants==
The captain of ''Tyr's Strike'' was [[Gehrm]], a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]]. The [[spelljamming helm]] was operated by [[Kalia]], a [[cleric]] of Tyr and Gehrm's wife. The [[grey elf]] brothers [[Dairn]] and [[Zadfraq]] completed the crew.
