The '''''Green Siren''''' was a privateer ship that belonged to Captain [[Thoster]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The pirate ship was named after its elaborate figurehead. It was a painted and sculpted form of a woman, a [[siren]] with shimmering green scales on her body replacing clothes. The siren's eyes sparkled in the sun with emerald green.

==History==
In [[1395 DR]], Captain Thoster claimed the ''Siren'' had had a run-in with a [[ghost ship]].

''Circa'' [[1396 DR]], the ''Green Siren'' did not fly its privateer pirate colors; it proudly displayed the Marhana Shipping trading company's flag. Thoster and his crew were tasked by Behroun Marhana with securing a seafaring alliance with kuo-toas of the Sea of Fallen Stars. That mission took the Siren to [[Hegruth]], a newly surfaced island where the ship was besieged by aberrant kuo-toas, [[Scrag|scrags]], and [[Sea hag|sea hags]], losing a few sailors and, namely [[Roger]] in the battle. The journey took the crew to [[Taunissik]] kuo-toa colony next where [[Dorian Nyrotha]] fell to the forces of kraken [[Gethshemeth]].
