The Green Siren was a privateer ship that belonged to Captain Thoster in the late 14 century DR.
The pirate ship was named after its elaborate figurehead. It was a painted and sculpted form of a woman, a siren with shimmering green scales on her body replacing clothes. The sirens eyes sparkled in the sun with emerald green.
In 1395 DR, Captain Thoster claimed the Siren had had a run-in with a ghost ship.
Circa 1396 DR, the Green Siren did not fly its privateer pirate colors it proudly displayed the Marhana Shipping trading companys flag. Thoster and his crew were tasked by Behroun Marhana with securing a seafaring alliance with kuo-toas of the Sea of Fallen Stars. That mission took the Siren to Hegruth, a newly surfaced island where the ship was besieged by aberrant kuo-toas, scrags, and sea hags, losing a few sailors and, namely Roger in the battle. The journey took the crew to Taunissik kuo-toa colony next where Dorian Nyrotha fell to the forces of kraken Gethshemeth.
