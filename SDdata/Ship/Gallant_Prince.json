        "Description": "The ship had many hidden cargo holds, as well as bedding rooms full of bunks.\n\nThe most interesting part of the ship was the captain's section. On the door leading to his quarters was a slab of [[ebony]] that was finely crafted into the face of a beautiful woman. Acting as a doorwarden to deny entry to those not permitted, the ebony face asked a question (albeit with the voice of a [[hag]] and not a fair maiden) and only the correct spoken answer could gain access. This room held many secret passages.",
        "History": "The ''Gallant Prince'' set off with its convoy in 1358 DR. However, the [[Kraken Society]] and a mage of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] wanted the sea lanes clear within their respective territory: the Purple Rocks to [[Luskan]]. So, the joint group made it their mission to take over, or otherwise destroy, any ships in this region. When the ''Gallant Prince'' came into these sea lanes, the combined group commanded [[undead]] to kill the sailors, and take over the ship. However, not all of the crew was killed, with some, including the captain, being [[flesh to stone|turned to stone]].\n\n{{fq\n|text=One by one, the undead they commanded have killed our crew, transforming them into lonely wanderers like themselves.\n|source=A sailor of the ''Gallant Prince''.\n}}\nOver a week after it went missing, it was spotted adrift off [[Port Llast]] by a local fisherman named [[Simon Hempwright]].
