        "mainbody": "The '''''Stirge''''' was a [[drakkar]] pirate vessel operating on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in [[1359 DR]].",
        "Description": "The ship had a crew of thirty pirates and sixty [[slave]]s used as oarsmen. A single [[fire projector]] was used when combating other vessels.",
        "History": "The ''Stirge'' was sworn to the service of the pirate [[Vurgrom]], who sent it out in 1359 DR alongside the ''[[Wind's Slave]]'' and two other ships to raid [[Teziir]]. They managed to capture the merchant [[Mulnis Lenz]] and a special treasure he carried, to be delivered from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]. Unbeknownst to the ''Stirge'', the ''Wind's Slave'' had been captured during the raid and sent after it, with the two ships meeting in battle again shortly afterwards."
