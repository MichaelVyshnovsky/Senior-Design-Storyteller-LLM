'''''Sea Lion''''' was a [[Ravenian]] [[merchantman]] ship that sank in the [[Dragon Reach]], north of the [[Ravens Bluff Harbor]], in [[1351 DR]] and was widely rumored thereafter to haunt the waters of the living as a [[ghost ship]].''Port of Ravens Bluff'' (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles O'Kane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR. The sinking of the ''Sea Lion'' is stated to have occurred 10 years prior, therefore it would likely have to be 1351 DR.

{{Quote|She does indeed seek port still, the Lion does. I've seen 'er with me good eye! 'Er 'ull be cracked open and seaweed 'angs from 'er masts like shredded sails. She be manned by corpses, I tell ye, and commanded by a wailing spirit that was 'er captain. Beware the Lion, lads and lassies!|A Ravenian sailor warning others to avoid the harbor on a foggy night}}

==Description==
A broken stump from the ship's mast and a piece of its smashed hull could be seen just barely breaking the water's surface whenever the tide was low.

==History==
''Circa'' 1351 DR, the ''Sea Lion'' went on a rather dangerous voyage spanning five [[tenday]]s, leaving them to fall behind schedule. As they made their way back home to the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] it was midway through the month of [[Uktar]], the height of gale season in the Dragon Reach, making for stormy waters to sail through. The ''Sea Lion'' made its way into the waters of the Ravens Bluff Harbor at around [[hours of the day|midnight]]. The crew was quite weary at that point, longing for the pleasures of Ravenian taverns, and the captain was hoping to make it into the Ravenian anchorage well before dawn hit.

But a thick fog rolled into the harbor, leaving the ''Sea Lion's'' crew to lose all sense of direction and sail in circles, searching in vain for the light of the [[Ladyrock Lighthouse]]. As the fog began to give the merchantman found itself to the north of the harbor, sailing into shallow depths. It came about carefully, the crew edging it back towards the Dragon Reach's deeper waters, but out of nowhere a violent storm rolled in and tossed the ''Sea Lion'' against 
rocky shoals. Its hull fractured from the impact, nearly splitting in two. Too exhausted to escape their sinking vessels, the entire crew of the ''Sea Lion'' perished with the merchantman as into disappeared into the depths.

The storm that brought about this demise was brought forth by [[Locaath Blackmanta]], a powerful [[sea elf]] [[conjurer]] that delighted in using storms against his enemies. In light of increasing sea traffic towards the city of Ravens Bluff, the [[wizard]] wanted to manufacture a shipwreck from which he could obtain some treasure and establish a lair within. His existence would go unknown to the people of the surface for over a decade,{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stroke of Midnight|5}}

As time passed the sinking of the ''Sea Lion'' became a common tale among Ravenian sailors, who told of the captain wailing a curse upon the Lighthouse with his dying breath and that ever since that day the gales of Uktar became stronger. Whether or not the alleged curse was the cause, experienced captains could could confirm that the Uktar gales of the Dragon Reach were worse than they were before that fateful night. 

Others told of the ''Sea Lion'' living on as a ghost ship, patrolling outside the harbor on nights of thick fog, still searching for the light it couldn't find all those years ago. Some of the sightings of these ships were instances of the ''[[spectral force]]'' [[spell]], casted by Locaath to act as distractions and cause confusion among those he targeted. Many other sightings were hoaxes perpetrated by [[smuggler]]s in an effort to keep prying eyes off their vessels, occasionally employing use of ''[[light]]'' spells to better give their ships a ghostly luminous appearance.

In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, a series of boat sinkings occurred within range of the Ravens Bluff Harbor. The ghost ships said by sailors to appear in the harbor on foggy nights were linked to these sinkings by the city's [[Nightwatch]].

Around that same year, Locaath Blackmanta learned of the power ''[[Calvan's Bell]]'' held to [[conjure]] [[undead]] and stole it from the Ladyrock Lighthouse.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stroke of Midnight|3}} He subsequently moved out from the wreckage of the ''Sea Lion'', thoroughly moving everything out from his lair and into a nearby cave after driving off a group of [[mongrelfolk]] that had been living within it.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stroke of Midnight|7}}

A group of [[adventurer]]s were quickly hired by Lord Mayor [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]] and Lady [[Lauren DeVillars]] to track the wizard down and retrieve the [[bell]].{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stroke of Midnight|6}}

When the adventurers finally made it to the ''Sea Lion'' it was clear to them that something had been living in the shipwreck until recently. However, they could found nothing of value within the wreckage, save for a few stray rocks from the cave Locaath had moved to.

==Reputation==
The physical remains of the ship, visible during low tides, was considered by some to be an eerie reminder of how powerful and dangerous the gales that occured in the month of Uktar could be.

Many people laughed off the posthumous myths surrounding the ''Sea Lion'' as no more the many tall tales that sailors typically spun, but just as many others swore by the tales. Because of the myths some sailors would avoid the Ravens Bluff Harbor on foggy nights and warn others to do the same.
