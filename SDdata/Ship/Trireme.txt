On average, from bow to stern these ships measured  in length, a beam (width) of , and required a depth of at least  in order to float. These ships were only partially decked, lacking any coverage over their three oar banks. They usually had a walkway that ran the whole length of the ship, between and overhead of the benches where the oar rowers would sit.
Triremes had single mast that could be lowered and it typically was during battles. They also had two stern rudders, a detachable ram, and little space for cargo on a trireme. all rowers, but could easily fit an extra thirty warrior passengers. The bare minimum of rowers necessary to sail a trireme were seventy, with the other hundred acting as a skeleton crew. Triremes could also be loaded with small artillery, though at the cost of deck space for passengers.
Over the years triremes were primarily used on Toril by the nations of east Faer√ªn. These included the three nations that made up the Old Empires region - Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther - as well as the navies of Aglarond and Thay of the Unapproachable East, and the nation of Chondath in the Vilhon Reach. Outside of naval use, triremes originating from both Chessenta and Chondath were among the pirate vessels one could encounter in the Pirate Isles as of 1356 DR.
Unthers navy was once the terror of the southern Inner Sea with its fleet of a hundred warships, most of them biremes and triremes, but over the course of several years their navy was whittled down until by 1359 DR it consisted of just five ships that were kept docked in the port city of Unthalass. By that year, triremes were considered to be a rare sight in the Inner Sea, primarily being used by the Mulhorandi, whereas the Chessentans rarely took their triremes outside the Bay of Chessenta.
On Flamerule 9, in the , two triremes were cut loose in the Bay of Chessenta and ran aground at Airspur. The Dragon Watch blamed this upon raiders from the Chessantan city-state of Soorenar, but later learned that it had been done by a raiding party of sahuagins.
In the 15 century DR, triremes were still widely considered to be the vessel of choice for sailing the Bay of Chessenta.
