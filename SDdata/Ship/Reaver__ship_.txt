The Reaver was a feared pirate vessel active in Suq Bay along Dihl al-Suq in 1367 DR.
The Reaver flew a standard of flying crossed cutlasses.
This large galleon was filled with 100 corsairs.
Armaments consisted of a pair of ballista and a liquid star projector that was capable of fully engulfing a ship in flames.
Captained by a bloodthirsty savage, the Reaver struck terror into the hearts of those sailing Suq Bay.
Anwar Tulam captained the Reaver. Several wizards went to sea with him as well.
