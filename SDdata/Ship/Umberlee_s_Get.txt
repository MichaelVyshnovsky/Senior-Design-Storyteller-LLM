The '''''Umberlee's Get''''' was the personal [[caravel]] of [[Jezgar Skentzin]], a [[greater seawolf]] pirate in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ship had a crew of 17 [[seawolves]] that had been infected by a seawolf that they had brought aboard and been attacked by, and was armed with two [[arbalest]]s. Whenever the crew took losses, they bit the new recruit and spread the seawolf infection.
