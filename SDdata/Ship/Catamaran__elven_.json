        "Description": "Elven [[catamaran]]s were fast double-hulled boats with [[oar]]s and three main sails, and were often carried three at a time by larger [[swanship]]s, [[dragonship (elven)|dragonships]], and [[wardragon]]s. They had a standard crew of ten [[elf|elven]] sailors which often included a spellcaster, and were equipped with two [[ballista]]e (one at the bow of each hull).\n\nCatamarans could reach a maximum sailing speed of {{SI|10|mile|k|long=yes}} per hour, and were intended for duties such as couriering, scouting, and harassing enemy vessels rather than direct combat. As they were small and lightly built, they were quite fragile and not the best at long oceanic voyages or rough weather."
