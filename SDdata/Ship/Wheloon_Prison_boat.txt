The '''Wheloon Prison boat''' was a large boat that was used by [[Har Pornoth]] and [[Frolo Sledge]] to transport prisoners for the [[Wheloon Prison]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The boat had a wide, flat deck and a single mast with a sail. The ship's wheel at the rear was covered with an open-sided pavilion to keep the elements off. Cargo (or passengers) were loaded into the lower deck through a hatch in the deck.

==History==
{{Quote
|Can't say I'm happy our boat is full of prisoners. But at least the cargo loads itself!
|Frolo Sledge
}}
Har and Frolo used the vessel for running cargo, but later took up prisoner transportation between [[Eveningstar]] and [[Wheloon]]. At one point in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], they transported Magistrate [[Barthold Moncrief]] and his prize prisoner, [[Dedryk Black]], along with a team of [[Purple Dragons]] for security. While encamped for the night on the shore of the [[Wyvernflow]] not too far from the destination, the group was attacked by [[lizardfolk]] led by the [[shaman]] [[Srass Marnanr]], who had been hired by the [[Shadovar]] to rescue Dedryk. Thanks to the assistance of [[adventurer]]s, the raiders were dispatched and Dedryk recovered intact.
