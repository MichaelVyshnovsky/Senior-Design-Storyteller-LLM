It played an important role in the War of the Spheres.\nThe ship was mainly active in Realmspace while under the command of Icarus.\nDuring the early stages of the vodoni invasion of Realmspace, the Arrow of Justice intercepted a ship whose crew of adventurers had had close contact with the invading forces and could provide valuable information in order to form a defense. The Arrow of Justice escorted the adventurers ship to the Rock of Bral, where a meeting of the Free Space Alliance was held to determine the next course of action.\nThroughout the battle, the ship served as the site for the war conferences and as the Alliances flagship. In the final battle, the Arrow of Justice led the attacking forces of the Alliance into Vodonispace."
