The Orca was a ship that sank at the Tower of Storms in the late 15 century DR.
The ship was about  long and had a single mast that stood over  high, which was all that was visible of the ship above water after it was wrecked. It lay just on the southern edge of the rocky outcropping on which the Tower of Storms was perched.
The Orca was sunk when its crew was compelled to steer the ship onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the magic beacon of the lighthouse set by Moesko, an anchorite of Talos. The crew perished, and their bodies were soon picked clean by hungry fish. The wreck then came to be prowled by sharks, including the fearsome Daggermaw.
The plot to sink the Orca was in service to efforts by the Cult of Talos to plunder ships along the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR. However, a chest containing a wand of secrets and a spellbook were never recovered from the wreck.
