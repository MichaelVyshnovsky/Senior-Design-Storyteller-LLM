The '''''Orca''''' was a ship that sank at the [[Tower of Storms]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ship was about {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} long and had a single mast that stood over {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} high, which was all that was visible of the ship above water after it was wrecked. It lay just on the southern edge of the rocky outcropping on which the Tower of Storms was perched.

==History==
The ''Orca'' was sunk when its crew was compelled to steer the ship onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the [[magic]] beacon of the lighthouse set by [[Moesko]], an [[anchorite of Talos]]. The crew perished, and their bodies were soon picked clean by hungry [[fish]]. The wreck then came to be prowled by [[shark]]s, including the fearsome [[Daggermaw]].

The plot to sink the ''Orca'' was in service to efforts by the [[Cult of Talos]] to plunder ships along the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. However, a chest containing a ''[[wand of secrets]]'' and a [[spellbook]] were never recovered from the wreck.
