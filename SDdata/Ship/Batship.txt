The '''''Batship''''' was an enormous cursed [[bat]]-shaped [[spelljammer]] that roamed the [[Tears of Selûne]].

==Description==
The ''Batship'' could assume two configurations: a flight mode, in which it looked like a regular ship, and a battle mode, in which it curled into an attack posture, feet first. The ship could attack with its claws, its tail, its breath weapon, or its bite, all controlled by the helmsman. It also possessed four [[ballista]]e that could be manned by a crew.

The unique design of the ship allowed it to act as an extension of its helmsman's body. Its [[spelljamming helm]] mimicked the helmsman's movements and transmitted back sensory information. The ship could be piloted in this way by a single individual. This great maneuverability, together with the ship's numerous magical defenses, made it a terrifying sight. It was known for terrorizing merchants and adventurers within the Tears of Selûne and other areas of [[Realmspace]].

The ship also carried a variety of curses. An individual boarding the ship risked being ''[[charm]]ed'' into becoming a member of its crew. The helm could only be accessed via a ''[[wish]]'' spell, and, once it became occupied, the only way for the helmsman to leave was via another ''wish'' cast by someone outside. The occupant became immortal but sense-deprived, only able to sense what the ship provided, and also incapable of committing suicide.

==History==
[[File:Batship-battle-2e.jpg|thumb|300px|''The ''Batship'' in battle mode tearing through a [[tradesman]].'']]
The ''Batship'' was created by a powerful wizard called [[Sarelk]]

Sarelk followed the ship to Realmspace and settled on [[Lumbe]], the second moon of [[H'Catha]], to research a way to free his wife from the ship's helm.

By the mid-14{{th}} century DR, the ''Batship's'' lair was located in [[the Cave]], an asteroid in the Tears of Selûne, near the center of the cluster. It was there that the ship and its crew stored its plunder before selling it.

==Rumors & Legends==
During its 700-year-long voyage to Realmspace, the ship reportedly visited [[Krynnspace]] as well.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Burnayette Skyansdanya]], a powerful [[wizard]] who had been trapped by the ship's helm since the 5{{th}} century DR.
