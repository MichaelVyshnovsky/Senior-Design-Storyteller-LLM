Erevans Clutch was a derelict flitter adrift in Realmspace.
The flitter drifted through wildspace with a broken mast, unusable sails, and one of its wings broken off. The ships spelljamming helm was also damaged and inoperable. Its air envelope was also completely fouled after an unknown length of time adrift.
The ship was captained by the drow wizard Dostrealt. He had taken the ship and exiled himself from an armada as a consequence of falling victim to a curse during a battle with a neogi mindspider. The curse took the form of a quasit that terrorized everyone around, except for Dostrealt himself.
