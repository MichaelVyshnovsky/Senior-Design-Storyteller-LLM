'''''Erevan's Clutch''''' was a derelict [[flitter]] adrift in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
The flitter drifted through [[wildspace]] with a broken mast, unusable sails, and one of its wings broken off. The ship's [[spelljamming helm]] was also damaged and inoperable. Its [[air envelope]] was also completely fouled after an unknown length of time adrift.

==History==
The ship was captained by the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Dostrealt]]. He had taken the ship and exiled himself from an [[Armada (spelljammer)|armada]] as a consequence of falling victim to a [[curse]] during a battle with a [[neogi mindspider]]. The curse took the form of a [[quasit]] that terrorized everyone around, except for Dostrealt himself.
