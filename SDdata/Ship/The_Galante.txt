'''''The Galante''''' was [[Saemon Havarian]]'s ship, which was used to transport [[Gorion's Ward]] from [[Athkatla]] to [[Brynnlaw]].

==Description==
The ship went under many names, which changed with time. It was a typical wooden vessel with a large ash-blue flag and contained a loud and boisterous crew.

==History==
The Galante transported Gorion's Ward and his companions to the pirate town of Brynnlaw, in an attempt to save [[Imoen]] from [[Jon Irenicus]] at [[Spellhold]]. The ship had a set of signal lights which could be used to replicate signals of marauding pirates. Due to this feature, the Galante was often able to mimic a pirate ship, and thus avoid battle completely.

==Rumors==
It was rumored that [[Aran Linvail]] from the [[Shadow Thieves]] guild of [[Athkatla]], and [[Bodhi]] of its rival guild, had interest in this ship.
