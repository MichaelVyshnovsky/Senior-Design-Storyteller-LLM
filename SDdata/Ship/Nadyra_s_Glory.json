        "mainbody": "'''''Nadyra's Glory''''' (also known as the '''''Lost Princess''''') was the bridal ship of Princess [[Aliia]] of [[Impiltur]]. which sank in mysterious circumstances on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in [[926 DR]] after leaving [[Hlammach]].",
        "Description": "This ship displayed purple sails in honor of the kingdom of Cormyr.",
        "History": "When ''Nadyra's Glory'' set sail from  Hlammach in 926 DR it was loaded with treasure and its aim was to unite Cormyr and Impiltur through Aliia's marriage to Crown Prince [[Rhiigard I]] of [[Cormyr]]. However, the ship ultimately sank about {{SI|30|miles|k|long=yes}} off its course, on a direct line between [[Tsurlagol]] and [[Wayrock]].\n\nThe wreck came to rest on its right side, and was quickly scavenged of its valuables by nearby undersea creatures, including [[koalinth]]s and [[scrag]]s. Amongst the treasures on board were the ''[[Greatsword of Impiltur]]'', ''[[Kimeltaar]]'' the Demonsbane Shield, and the ''[[Crowns of Whispers]]''. It was looted, at least in part, by the [[succubus]] [[demon lord]] [[Soneillon]].\n\nIn the four centuries following its sinking, many a sailors and pirates spoke of having seen ''Nadyra's Glory'' as a [[ghost ship]] off the coast of Impiltur. There sightings always occurred between at early morning between Tsurlagol and [[Lyrabar]]. They spoke of the ship's presence being preceded by a fog rolling in, followed by the scent of [[violet]]s and a [[ghost]]ly woman (believed to be Aliia) sobbing loudly as she plucks at the strings of a small [[harp]]. Finally, another ship bearing a purple sail would appear alongside it and they would proceed to either exit the fog or disappear as the fog was cleared away by [[the sun]].\n\nThe sightings of the ''Nadyra's Glory'' ghost ship came to be considered an ill omen, though at the same time many pitied the cursed state of the ship and its passenger."
