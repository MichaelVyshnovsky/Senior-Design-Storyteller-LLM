The '''''Dirty Dastard''''' was a pirating vessel that was active in the seas around [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
After it was sunk, the ''Dirty Dastard's'' mast and upper decks were stripped away from the rest of the hull. The belly of the ship became overgrown with [[barnacle]]s and [[snail]]s.

==History==
About nine years before the [[death curse]] afflicted the Realms, the ''Dirty Dastard'' was sunk at sea. It washed ashore along the banks of the [[Snout of Omgar]], and was looted by the [[tortle]]s of [[Ahoyhoy]] shortly thereafter.

Some time later, the wreckage of the ''Dirty Dastard'' was taken over by the [[sea hag]] [[Myldryd Urchinspine]] and her two [[giant crab]] minions.
