        "mainbody": "The '''''Gauntlet''''' was a refitted [[Scorpion (spelljammer)|scorpion]] that served as flagship of the [[Gauntlet (organization)|Gauntlet]], the self-proclaimed police force of the [[Tears of Selûne]] in the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "All the ''Gauntlet'''s  weapons had been magically enhanced for increased accuracy. The [[catapult]] mounted on the ship's tail was mounted on a turret that allowed it to freely rotate in all directions. The catapult on the main deck also had a similar turret, which allowed it to rotate almost entirely freely, except in directions that would result in it hitting the ship's tail.",
        "History": "The ''Gauntlet'' was purchased from the [[Arcane (race)|arcane]] by the [[paladin]] [[Kyriel Alathar Pellinore]] after he left his position in the [[Council of Elders]] of [[Everlund]] to personally pursue justice against an illithid attack that captured 200 people, including his family.\n\nThe ship was involved in the organization's rise to fame when it attacked and dismantled a [[neogi]] slave trade cell that operated on one of the asteroids of the Tears. The attack destroyed all buildings on the asteroid and killed nearly all of the 100 neogi and several [[mind flayer]]s who were also trading altered [[humanoid]]s from their farms on [[Glyth]]. The few surviving slavers reported the events of the attack to other members of their species, which resulted in a bounty of more than 100,000 [[gp]] for the capture of the ship.",
        "Inhabitants": "The ship's captain was Kyriel, who was assisted by his apprentice [[Ansalok]]. Three [[mage]]s took turns at the [[spelljamming helm]]: [[Cambrigha]], [[Savion]], and [[Vom]]. Joining the crew were also three [[priest]]s: [[Liasa]], [[Sunea]], and [[Kierie]]. The three mages had six apprentices who were also part of the crew: [[Alekra]], [[Vicales]], [[Nogard]], [[Sarden]], [[Chare]], and [[Sharondel]]."
