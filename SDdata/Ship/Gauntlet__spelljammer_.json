The catapult mounted on the ships tail was mounted on a turret that allowed it to freely rotate in all directions. The catapult on the main deck also had a similar turret, which allowed it to rotate almost entirely freely, except in directions that would result in it hitting the ships tail.\nThe Gauntlet was purchased from the arcane by the paladin Kyriel Alathar Pellinore after he left his position in the Council of Elders of Everlund to personally pursue justice against an illithid attack that captured 200 people, including his family.\nThe ship was involved in the organizations rise to fame when it attacked and dismantled a neogi slave trade cell that operated on one of the asteroids of the Tears. The attack destroyed all buildings on the asteroid and killed nearly all of the 100 neogi and several mind flayers who were also trading altered humanoids from their farms on Glyth. The few surviving slavers reported the events of the attack to other members of their species, which resulted in a bounty of more than 100,000 gp for the capture of the ship.\nThe ships captain was Kyriel, who was assisted by his apprentice Ansalok. Three mages took turns at the spelljamming helm Cambrigha, Savion, and Vom. Joining the crew were also three priests Liasa, Sunea, and Kierie. The three mages had six apprentices who were also part of the crew Alekra, Vicales, Nogard, Sarden, Chare, and Sharondel."
