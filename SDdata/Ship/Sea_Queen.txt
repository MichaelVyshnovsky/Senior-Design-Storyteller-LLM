The Sea Queen was a huge dromond and the flagship of the Wraith of the Inner Sea privateer fleet in the midâ€“14 century DR. Based out of Reth, the fleet prowled the Chessentan coast, the Wizards Reach, and Inner Sea.
By 1357 DR, it was captained by Kreodo, the leader of the fleet and the "Sea Queen" herself.
It had a complement of two-hundred crewmembers, fifty marines, and thirteen or seven wizards.
