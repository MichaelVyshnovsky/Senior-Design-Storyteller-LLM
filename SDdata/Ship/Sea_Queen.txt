The '''''Sea Queen''''' was a huge [[dromond]] and the flagship of the [[Wraith of the Inner Sea]] privateer fleet in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Based out of [[Reth]], the fleet prowled the [[Chessenta]]n coast, the [[Wizards' Reach]], and [[Inner Sea]].

By [[1357 DR]], it was captained by [[Kreodo]], the leader of the fleet and the "Sea Queen" herself.

It had a complement of two-hundred crewmembers, fifty marines, and thirteen or seven [[wizard]]s.
