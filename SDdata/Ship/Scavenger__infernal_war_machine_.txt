A '''Scavenger''' was a bulky [[infernal war machine]] built with a clawed arm used to haul damaged machines or other debris worth salvaging from the battlefield.

==Description==
Attached to the back of the Scavenger was a massive swinging crane with an iron grappling claw fastened to the end of a winch and a {{SIAdj|50|foot|long=yes|adj=long}} chain.

==Abilities==
The grappling claw of a Scavenger could be used to catch objects and creatures alike. The claw's operator could choose to release whatever the claw was holding. It could carry up to {{SI|4000|lb|k|long=yes}} in cargo.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Mad Maggie]], a [[night hag]], owned a Scavenger in her garage at [[Fort Knucklebone]] that she used for salvage operations.<ref>
