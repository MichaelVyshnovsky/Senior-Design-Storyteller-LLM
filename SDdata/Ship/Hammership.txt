A '''hammership''' was a large, powerful, and resilient [[shark]]-shaped [[spelljammer]] ship typically associated with [[human]]s.

==Description==
The forward section of a hammership was its most protected location. It was usually where the [[spelljamming helm]] was found. The "eyes" were usually made of glass or metal under a ''[[Glassteel (spell)|glassteel]]'' spell. Its rear section was equipped with weapons that could aim in any direction.

The ship required a minimum crew of 24 creatures and could support a maximum compliment of 60 creatures without compromising its air supply.

Hammerships were commonly employed as trading ships due to their large cargo capacity. Trading hammerships were frequently employed by humans and [[lizardfolk]], but occasionally an unaligned [[mind flayer]] trader crew might also use a hammership to conduct trade, since using a [[nautiloid]] would immediately attract enemy fire. Despite being heavy and slow, they also performed well when used for military purposes, in particular by [[Elf|elven]] crews.

==History==
[[File:Nautiloid_vs_hammership-2e.jpg|thumb|200px|''A hammership being rammed by a [[nautiloid]].'']]
The design of the hammership remained unchanged for millennia. Even the oldest ships encountered resembled the ones still under construction in [[Arcane (race)|Arcane]] drydocks.

The legendary pirate [[Bloodjack]] of [[Realmspace]] commanded a red hammership called ''[[Lucky Victory]]'', known for a career spanning over a decade in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].
