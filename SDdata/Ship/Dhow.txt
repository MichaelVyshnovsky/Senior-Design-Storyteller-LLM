A dhow was a small sailing ship with a single, triangular sail.
They were commonly used in Calimshan by fishermen.
All ships of Zakharan build were dhowsâ€”indeed "dhow" was the Midani term for "ship". Various sizes of dhows, from 40 to 200 feet (12 to 61 meters) in length were employed in the Land of Fate. Five distinct types were recognized the baghla, the barijah, the boom, the sambuk, and the zaruq (or zarug).
