A '''dhow''' was a small sailing ship with a single, triangular sail.

==In Calimshan==
They were commonly used in [[Calimshan]] by fishermen.

==In Zakhara==
All ships of [[Zakhara]]n build were dhowsâ€”indeed "dhow" was the [[Midani]] term for "ship". Various sizes of dhows, from 40 to 200 feet (12 to 61 meters) in length were employed in the Land of Fate. Five distinct types were recognized: the [[baghla]], the [[barijah]], the [[Boom (ship)|boom]], the [[sambuk]], and the [[zaruq]] (or zarug).<ref>
