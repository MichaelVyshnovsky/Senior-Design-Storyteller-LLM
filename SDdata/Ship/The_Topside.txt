'''''The Topside''''' was a [[barge]] that sailed up and down the [[Fire River]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''The Topside'' was a large, flat wooden ship with a cartel structure that resembled a simple tent stretched upon a wooden frame. The barge carried a sporadic selection of crates, boxes, and luggage, all covered by tarps, along with passengers and the crew.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, ''The Topside'' was run by a rugged but friendly retired [[adventurer]] named [[Jedd]]. The crew was numbered at nine. At all times, three of them ensured the barge stayed on course while the rest focused on other tasks or took breaks. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, ''The Topside'' was hired by [[Shauna Morden]], the proprietress of the [[Tavern of the Garden]], to transport a band of adventurers from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] to the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]]. Along the several-days-long journey, Jedd entertained his passengers by telling them the story of the [[red dragon]] [[ Firewings]] and the group of heroes who slew the beast, giving the name to the village of Dragon Falls.
