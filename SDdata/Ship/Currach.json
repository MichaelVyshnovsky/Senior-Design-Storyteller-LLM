        "mainbody": "A currach was a large, round boat used mainly for fishing in Aglarond and Turmish. It was sometimes known as a coracle.\nThe hull of a currach was built using thick animal hides or canvas stretched over a frame made from wood or wicker. A typical specimen was 20 ft (6.1 m) long by 8 ft (2.4 m) wide, with a single mast for a sail and four oars. Crew size ranged from a minimum of two to a maximum of ten. Currachs were not built to carry a weapon or a ram. The seaworthiness of this vessel limited it to coastal waters, where it was used for fishing.\nTrimias catalogue of Outer Plane artifacts could manifest a magical currach that could transport users to the River Oceanus in Amoria, the first layer of Elysium."
