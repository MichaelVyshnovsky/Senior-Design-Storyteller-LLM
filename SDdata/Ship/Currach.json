        "mainbody": "A '''currach''' was a large, round boat used mainly for [[fish]]ing in [[Aglarond]] and [[Turmish]]. It was sometimes known as a '''[[coracle]]'''.",
        "Description": "The hull of a currach was built using thick animal [[hide (material)|hides]] or [[canvas]] stretched over a frame made from [[wood]] or [[wicker]]. A typical specimen was 20 ft (6.1 m) long by 8 ft (2.4 m) wide, with a single mast for a sail and four oars. Crew size ranged from a minimum of two to a maximum of ten. Currachs were not built to carry a weapon or a ram. The seaworthiness of this vessel limited it to coastal waters, where it was used for fishing.",
        "Notable Currachs": "''[[Trimia's catalogue of Outer Plane artifacts]]'' could manifest a magical currach that could transport users to the River [[Oceanus]] in [[Amoria]], the first layer of [[Elysium]]."
