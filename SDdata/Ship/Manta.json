        "mainbody": "Mantas, otherwise referred to by their creators as fliers, were a type of submersible barge used by sahuagin to transport both themselves and their ill-gotten gains.\nThis vessels surface-dweller name was derived from its resemblance to the creature of the same name.\nThese vessels were typically constructed from salvaged shipwrecks, and the odd coastal wood. They could typically carry a crew of up to six hundred sahuagin or more. On average, a manta could traverse up to  a day or, if need be,  a day at risk of exhausting the crew (equivalent to a forced march for surface dwellers). This feat was achieved by crew rotation, as two-thirds of the crew would actively be pushing the vehicle forward, while the remainder rested on top of the craft."
