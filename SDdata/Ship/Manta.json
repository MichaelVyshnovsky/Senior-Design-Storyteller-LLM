        "Description": "This vessel's surface-dweller name was derived from its resemblance to the [[manta ray|creature of the same name]].\n\nThese vessels were typically constructed from salvaged shipwrecks, and the odd coastal wood. They could typically carry a crew of up to six hundred sahuagin or more. On average, a manta could traverse up to {{SI|240|miles|long=yes}} a day or, if need be, {{SI|360|miles|long=yes}} a day at risk of exhausting the crew (equivalent to a forced march for surface dwellers). This feat was achieved by crew rotation, as two-thirds of the crew would actively be pushing the vehicle forward, while the remainder rested on top of the craft."
