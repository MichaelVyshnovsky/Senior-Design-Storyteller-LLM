        "mainbody": "A knarr was a small ship used mainly in the North for transporting cargo.\nA typical knarr was 60 ft (18 m) long at the keel and 15 ft (4.6 m) wide at the beam. It had one mast that mounted one square sail and had a flat bottom for easy beaching and sailing on rivers. If needed, a few oars could be mounted fore and aft to increase speed or in case of calm winds. It had a minimum crew size of eight and could go as high as fourteen. The knarr carried no weapons and could not be equipped with a ram.\nA small knarr was one of a few vessels that could be constructed from the (mostly) undamaged corpse of a dragon."
