        "mainbody": "The '''''Sea Jewel''''' was a huge [[dromond]] and part of the [[Wraith of the Inner Sea]] privateer fleet in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Based out of [[Reth]], the fleet prowled the [[Chessenta]]n coast, the [[Wizards' Reach]], and [[Inner Sea]]. It was a heavy marine support vessel \n\nBy [[1357 DR]], it was captained by [[Bendensar]] and its first mate was [[Lorien]], a mage. It had a complement of two-hundred crewmembers, one-hundred marines, and three [[wizard]]s or fifty marines and seven wizards.\n\nThe Wraith were on a contract with [[Turmish]] when the ''Sea Jewel'' was scuttled by the former mercenary unit called the [[Agency]]. It sunk with all crew lost. [[Kreodo]], leader of the Wraith, was still waiting for Turmish to replace the loss of the ''Sea Jewel'' in the early 1360s DR."
