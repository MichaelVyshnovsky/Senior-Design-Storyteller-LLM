        "mainbody": "he Bitch Queen was a ship and floating temple to the goddess Umberlee that sailed the seas along the western coasts of Faer√ªn during the Era of Upheaval.\nThe ships figurehead featured the likeness of a screaming woman with kelp for hair, presumably Umberlee herself.\nNearly a century before the Second Sundering, the Bitch Queen crashed against the shores of the Snout of Omgar in Chult. The tortles of the isle rescued the survivors of the shipwreck, including its captain, a charismatic woman and cleric of Umberlee. All that remained of the Bitch Queen itself was its figurehead, its bowsprit, and a portion of its aft castle.\nTaken in by the captains charm, and captivating stories about sea monsters and naval battles, the tortles built for her and her people the temple-fortress of Dangwaru."
