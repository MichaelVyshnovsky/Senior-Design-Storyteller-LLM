        "mainbody": "The '''''Bitch Queen''''' was a ship and floating temple to the goddess [[Umberlee]] that sailed the seas along the western coasts of [[Faer√ªn]] during the [[Era of Upheaval]].",
        "Description": "The ships figurehead featured the likeness of a screaming woman with kelp for hair, presumably Umberlee herself.",
        "History": "Nearly a century before the [[Second Sundering]], the ''Bitch Queen'' crashed against the shores of the [[Snout of Omgar]] in [[Chult]]. The [[tortle]]s of the isle rescued the survivors of the shipwreck, including its captain, a charismatic woman and [[cleric]] of Umberlee. All that remained of the ''Bitch Queen'' itself was its figurehead, its bowsprit, and a portion of its aft castle.\n\nTaken in by the captain's charm, and captivating stories about sea monsters and naval battles, the tortles built for her and her people the temple-fortress of [[Dangwaru]]."
