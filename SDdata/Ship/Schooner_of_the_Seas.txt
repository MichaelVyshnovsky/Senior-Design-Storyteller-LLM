The Schooner of the Seas was a ship and temple dedicated to Valkur, the Captain of the Waves.
Originally constructed in Almraiven, the Schooner of the Seas was the fastest known ship to sail on Toril. It featured an advanced design that left even the masters in Lantan befuddled. The ships journeys reached exotic places such as Zakhara, Maztica, Nimbral, and Kara-Tur. It was based in Athkatla and commonly seen between Waterdeep and Calimport.
Some believed that Gond built the Schooner of the Seas for Valkur.
