The '''''Ship''''' was the [[longship]] of the [[hill giant]] [[Huzza]], a [[pirate]] of sorts who roamed about the [[Inner Sea]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
With a crew of 70 untrained [[goblin]]s, the ''Ship'' was slow and ungainly in the water. Huzza caught other ships by throwing crew goblins at the rigging, occasionally landing a hit and allowing the goblin to sabotage the lines. With the target slowed, Huzza and the ''Ship'' could catch up, loot the target vessel, and eat the crew.

==History==
Huzza obtained the ''Ship'' when its crew landed near his home and attacked him, only to be eaten to the last member. He found some [[gold]] in the longship and decided to use it to find more gold and food on the sea, and so crewed it with his goblin servants and set off. He recruited several more goblin tribes to work aboard his vessel, but his use of them as ammunition steadily depleted their numbers and only his immense strength and size kept them from mutiny or desertion.
