        "mainbody": "Kinship was a shipping vessel, based out of Baldurs Gate and operating in the Sea of Swords in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , Kinship sailed from and to Baldurs Gate, transporting goods from the Moonshae Isles. During one of the ships voyages, it passed through one of the Moonshae straits, where it became the target of the Birth Queen Umberlees fickle nature. The goddesss wrath pummelled the prow of the ship, claiming the lives of two sailors. Once the victims of her wrath were drowned in Umberlees salty depths, the storm calmed, allowing Kinship to pass.\nThe incident was included in a report submitted to the priestesses of the Water Queens House in Baldurs Gate. The author of the note suspected that on the ships next voyage, it would likely avoid the same route and the Queens wrath, only to face the dangers of a lesser-known and longer naval route."
