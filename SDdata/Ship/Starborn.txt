Lora Bergauz
Starborn was a ship that once belonged to Lora Bergauz of Baldurs Gate. It was a Valour-class gaff-rigged three-mast, five-gun, sixth-rate sailing vessel.
Lora Bergauz retired to the city of Baldurs Gate with her daughter after selling her ship, the Starborn. Despite its damaged condition, with two of the five guns broken and the starboard side requiring moderate repair, Lora received a bid of 10,000 gold pieces from an anonymous buyer.
