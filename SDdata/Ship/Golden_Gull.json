        "mainbody": "The '''''Golden Gull''''' was a merchant ship owned by the [[Irlentree]] [[patriar]] family that sank at the [[Tower of Storms]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ship was about {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} long with a single mast that stood over {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} high, which was all that was visible of the ship above water after it was wrecked. The remains of the crew were scattered about the ship, their bodies having been picked clean by [[fish]]. The murky water was home [[shark]]s such as the fearsome [[Daggermaw]].",
        "History": "As of [[1492 DR]], [[Hitoshi Jade]] was a sailor who worked aboard the Golden Gull and frequented the [[Low Lantern]].\n\nThe ''Golden Gull'' was sunk when it was lured onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the bewitching magic of [[Moesko]]&mdash;an [[anchorite of Talos]]&mdash;in service to efforts by the [[Cult of Talos]] to plunder ships along the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. However, a chest containing a trove of [[electrum piece]]s and valuable [[pearl]]s were never recovered from the wreck."
