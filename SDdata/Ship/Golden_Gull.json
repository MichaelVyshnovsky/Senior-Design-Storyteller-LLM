        "mainbody": "The Golden Gull was a merchant ship owned by the Irlentree patriar family that sank at the Tower of Storms in the late 15 century DR.\nThe ship was about  long with a single mast that stood over  high, which was all that was visible of the ship above water after it was wrecked. The remains of the crew were scattered about the ship, their bodies having been picked clean by fish. The murky water was home sharks such as the fearsome Daggermaw.\nAs of 1492 DR, Hitoshi Jade was a sailor who worked aboard the Golden Gull and frequented the Low Lantern.\nThe Golden Gull was sunk when it was lured onto the rocks beneath the Tower of Storms by the bewitching magic of Moesko&mdashan anchorite of Talos&mdashin service to efforts by the Cult of Talos to plunder ships along the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR. However, a chest containing a trove of electrum pieces and valuable pearls were never recovered from the wreck."
