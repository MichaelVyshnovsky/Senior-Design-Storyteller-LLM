        "Description": "A coracle was made from a basic and lightweight frame, which could be made from [[wicker]] or branches. Over this frame, a waterproof material was stretched, such as treated [[hide (material)|hide]], [[canvas]], or [[bark]]. As a result, a coracle was very light, weighing up to just {{SI|40|lb|k|long=yes}} and could be easily portaged. While in the water, a coracle could only reach a speed of {{SIspeed|1|mph|k|h|long=yes}} without the aid of a current.",
        "Usage": "Coracles were common in the [[Moonshae Isles]],{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|65}} on the [[River Rauvin]], They were also a frequent sight within the harbor of [[Loudwater]].\n\nOn the [[Darklake]], a series of connected bodies of water in the [[Underdark]], coracles were carved from [[zurkhwood]]."
