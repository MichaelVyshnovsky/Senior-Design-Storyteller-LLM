The Emerald Eye was a pirate ship based out of Jahaka Anchorage during the late 15 century DR.
The Emerald Eye had a mermaid-shaped figurehead. It also had cabins decorated like the homes of the pashas of Calimshan.
The Emerald Eye was captained by the Calishite pirate Zaroum Al-Saryak. Its first mate was a berserker by the name of Voltan. The crew included fourteen Calishite pirates and five Chultan warriors.
