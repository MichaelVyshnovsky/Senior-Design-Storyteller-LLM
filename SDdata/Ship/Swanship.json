        "Description": "These vessels were {{SI|130|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} wide, propelled by sails and [[oar]]s. They were heavily decorated with their bowsprits carved as [[swan]]s, and the rudders, masts, oars, and spars carved or painted ornately by [[elf|elven]] artisans. Their striped sails were emblazoned with the symbols of ancient houses and kingdoms, and the gunwales were hung with various [[shield]]s.\n\nThough heavily beautified, swanships were swift and powerful warships with excellent seaworthiness. They had a crew of 80 sailors, a normal complement of 20 marines, three heavy [[ballista]]e or [[catapult]]s, a [[fire projector]], and could be fitted with a [[ship ram]]. They were also typically protected with inscribed [[totemic image]]s to improve the vessel's performance, and carried up to three [[Catamaran (elven)|catamarans]] that could be deployed as escorts. They were usually deployed in squadrons of three ships, and served alongside [[dragonship (elven)|dragonships]] and [[wardragon]]s as they protected Evermeet's shores and vulnerable civilian ships at sea."
