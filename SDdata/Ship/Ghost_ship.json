        "mainbody": "'''Ghost ships''' were incorporeal vessels that were sailed by crews made up of the [[undead]]. They could manifest or be seen at any time of day, though they often attacked during the night when their crew was at its strongest.",
        "Description": "Ghost ships typically resembled and behaved like a normal ship, but possessed a number of [[magic resistance|magical resistances]], such as to damage from [[acid]], [[fire]], lightning, and thunder.",
        "Crews": "The undead that made up the crew of ghost ships were typically individuals that had died in some grisly manner and had unfinished business that kept them tethered to the [[Prime Material plane]]. They sometimes served [[necromancer]]s, but more often had no master.\n\nGhost ships that were largely good- or neutral-aligned had crews made up entirely of [[ghost]]s. When it came to more evil-aligned ships, it was often the case that crews largely consisted of [[skeleton]]s, [[zombie]]s, a small number of [[specter]]s, and [[wraith]]s acting as officers. Other types of undead that were known to be found on ghost ships included [[ju-ju zombie]]s, [[sea zombie]]s, and even [[lich]]es.<ref>\n\nGhost ships that occurred in the land of [[Zakhara]] were known to not only have skeletons and zombies as crewmen, but [[lacedon]]s. And ghosts, specters, or [[vampire]]s as officers.",
        "Regions": "Much like other undead manifestations, a ghost ship was tied to a particular area. However, unlike other undead this area of manifestation was much wider and mobile for a ghost ship.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2011)/07-11 - Undead Manifestations}}\n\nIn [[Faerûn]], this phenomenon was most likely to occur within the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. In the land of [[Kara-Tur]], ghost ships were said to drift through the straits known as the [[Dragon's Teeth]] between [[Koryo]] and [[Kozakura]]. And they occasionally occurred in the seas around Zakhara.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], the phenomenon of ghost ships occurred on the worlds of [[Krynn]] and [[Oerth]]. Beyond the planets themselves, even [[spelljammer]]s could become ghost ships.{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|53}}\n\nIn the [[Shadowfell]], ghost ships occasionally materialized in the city of [[Evernight]], atop the river of lava where once water flowed. These ships never had visible crew and would materialize docking at the city's empty piers for a period of a few hours or even days, all the while emitting sounds of activity on deck, until eventually moving upstream and disappearing.<ref>",
        "History": "In the four centuries that followed its sinking in the {{YearlinkName|924}}, pirates and sailors alike reported seeing the ghost of the purple-sailed ''[[Nadyra's Glory]]'' near the [[Impiltur]]an coast. These sightings were always between the cities of [[Lyrabar]] and [[Tsurlagol]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1322 DR]], [[Daavid Ali Fazeer]] claimed that he found his [[magic]]al [[scimitar]], the ''[[Nosfiraat's Blade]]'', aboard a ghost ship that was sunk shortly after his excursion onto it.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], a ghost ship of a high-prowed [[galley]] flying the symbols of [[Myrkul]] terrorized the [[Savage Frontier]] region, sometimes being seen to even travel across the land. Wherever it went the sky would darken and a storm blew ahead. Plants it passed would wither away and die. It was crewed by around thirty skeletons draped in seaweed, who were commanded by a pair of specters.\n\nAround that same year, two [[wong gua]] warriors patrolling the waters around the [[Gua-Sar Caves]] were killed by some [[hai nu]]. Their spirits continued to patrol those waters within a ghostly canoe.\n\nSome years after the [[Time of Troubles]] of 1358 DR, the hero [[Galadaunt]] found a [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Chambeeleon]]'' upon the deck of a ghost ship in the [[Emerald Isles]].\n\nIn the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the legendary pirate captain [[Pohl Strongwind]] returned to life as a [[coffer corpse]]. Alongside a crew of ju-ju zombies he sailed on a ghostly version of his former ship across the [[Dragon Reach]], terrorizing any vessel they came across, until eventually a group of [[adventurer]]s put them both to rest.{{Cite polyhedron/130/Strongwind|28, 33}}\n\nAround [[1361 DR]], there were repeated sinkings of ships off the coast of [[Ravens Bluff]] that were blamed by the city's nightwatch on ghost ships. In reality, these ships were merely [[illusion]]s made by the [[sea elf]] [[conjurer]] [[Locaath Blackmanta]] with ''[[spectral force]]''.''Port of Ravens Bluff'' (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles O'Kane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR.\n\nIn [[1395 DR]], Captain [[Thoster]] claimed that their privateer ship the ''[[Green Siren]]'' had a run-in with a ghost ship.\n\nAround the late–14{{th}} century DR, a ghost ship pulled into the harbor of the port city [[Spandeliyon]] on a foggy night and its ghostly pirate crew swarmed the dock, raiding buildings and attacking citizenry, but unable to interact with anything on the Material Plane. Thereafter the event began to reoccur every few days, becoming a local legend that attracted people from afar to visit Spandeliyon. Then one night the ghosts were suddenly able to interact with the Material world, killing several people and vandalizing shops before they disappeared into the fog. When next the ship appeared local [[cleric]]s tried to destroy them, but were unsuccessful. From then on, the people of Spandeliyon would avoid the docks at night.<ref>{{Cite web/Steal This Hook/Menace from the Undead}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, rumors of [[dracolich]]es and ghost ships wandering the [[Moonsea]] were on the rise, attracting many to the region out of curiosity.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|7}}",
        "Notable Ghost Ships": "* ''[[Moonwind]]'', a ghost ship that was commanded by the [[wight]] [[Moarinskoar Irlingstar]] and his crew of zombies.\n* ''[[Nadyra's Glory]]'', otherwise known as the ''Lost Princess'', was a ghost ship that appeared off the coast of [[Impiltur]] since its sinking in 926 DR. Pirates and sailors who had seen the ''Lost Princess'' noted that it was accompanied by fog, the scent of [[violet]]s, and the loud sobbing of a ghostly woman as she plucked away at a small [[harp]]. Finally, another ship bearing a purple sail would appear and they would disappear into the fog together. Sighting of this ship was considered to be an ill omen.\n* ''[[Ravager (ship)|Ravager]]''\n* ''[[Red Prow]]''\n* ''[[Retaliator]]'', a former [[caravel]] pirate ship from the [[Nelanther Isles]].\n* ''[[Sky Ranger]]'', a [[galleon]] spelljammer.\n* ''[[Unforgiven]]'', a ghost ship commanded by the sorcerous ghoul [[Jeremiah Dow]] that haunted the Inner Sea ever since its sinking in the 10{{th}} century DR.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Revenge's Sweet/Round Two|12}}\n\nThe undead-crewed ships of the Dead Fleet that followed ''[[The Black Basilisk]]'' of Luskan were termed \"ghost ships\".{{Cite polyhedron/68/The Everwinking Eye: Goodbye, Mulmaster|28}}",
        "Trivia": "* [[prayer-token of Umberlee|''Prayer-tokens of Umberlee'']] were [[magic item]]s that could summon ghost ships from depths of the ocean, filled with sea zombies that were under the control of the goddess [[Umberlee]].\n* The deity [[Valkur]] would sometimes appear before ships lost at sea as a ghost ship on the horizon, never drawing closer to them or falling further behind, leading them to the nearest port."
