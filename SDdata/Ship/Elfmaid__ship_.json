        "mainbody": "The Elfmaid was a Ruathen pirate ship captained by Hrolf the Unruly that plied the Sea of Swords.\nThe Elfmaid was long and graceful, clinker-built of strong, light wood. The hull was deep and provided room for cargo and cramped sleeping quarters. \"Castle\" platforms painted with the warrior crews coats of arms were located in both the fore and aft of the ship. It had a large sail, as well as a line of oars. The ships figurehead was a busty ten-foot carving of an elven maiden.\nIn 1361 DR, the rogue drow Liriel Baenre sprang the rowdy captain Hrolf from jail in Skullport in order to have him take her and her companion, Fyodor, to Ruathym. Along the way, the Elfmaid discovered a ship (the Cutter) bearing barrels of pickled sea elves that it had discovered on an abandoned ship. It was later discovered that these sea elves were part of a conspiracy by the Kraken Society and High Captains of Luskan to provoke Waterdeep and the Lords Alliance to war against Ruathym. The Elfmaid aided in discovering the conspiracy. \nShortly afterwards, Hrolf was killed while in Ruathym and the Elfmaid was sent off -- in a funeral bonfire -- into the sea bearing his body. In memory of Hrolf, Liriel magically turned the figurehead to figure of Hrolf as it was destroyed.\nIn 1361 DR, the following crewmembers were on board\n*Hrolf, captain.\n*Ibn, first mate.\n*Olvir, crewmember young man who wanted to be a skald but disliked the lower status bards held in his culture, so instead he became a shipman to sate his thirst for adventure.\n*Bjorn, the youngest member of the crew his hobbies were carving and painting.\n*Liriel Baenre, a drow who traveled with the crew in 1361 DR.\n*Fyodor, Rashemi berserker who traveled with the crew in 1361 DR.\n*Xzorsh, a sea elf who had pledge to protect the Elfmaid and her crew.\nHrolf sang a ditty about the Elfmaid while he was locked away in Skullport\n\"When you meet with the lads of the Elfmaid, my friend, \nYou would rather face Umberlees wrath. \nHand over a measure of all of your treasure, \nOr swim in a saltwater bath! \nCome ashore with the lads of the Elfmaid, my friend. \nWere awash on an ocean of ale !\nSome taverns to plunder, some guards to sunder, \nAnd then, a short rest in the jail!\""
