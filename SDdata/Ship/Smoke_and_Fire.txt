The Smoke and Fire was a ship in Vaelan, whose steward was Yonald. In , the Imaskari vengeance taker Iahn Qoyllor negotiated for a trip to Huorm for himself, Ususi Manaallin, and Eined Datharathi. Though they were attacked by several of Xaemar Datharathis men, Ususis display of magic convinced Yonald not to back out of their deal, and he even gave Ususi and Eined his own cabin for their use. Shadow efts attacked the ship later during the trip, but it reached Huorm.
