The '''''Smoke and Fire''''' was a ship in [[Vaelan]], whose steward was [[Yonald]]. In {{yearlink|1374}}, the [[Imaskari vengeance taker]] [[Iahn Qoyllor]] negotiated for a trip to [[Huorm]] for himself, [[Ususi Manaallin]], and [[Eined Datharathi]]. Though they were attacked by several of [[Xaemar Datharathi]]'s men, Ususi's display of magic convinced Yonald not to back out of their deal,{{cite book/Darkvision|124-127|13}} and he even gave Ususi and Eined his own cabin for their use.{{cite book/Darkvision|128|13}} [[Shadow eft]]s attacked the ship later during the trip,{{cite book/Darkvision|159-163|17}} but it reached Huorm.{{cite book/Darkvision|189|20}}
