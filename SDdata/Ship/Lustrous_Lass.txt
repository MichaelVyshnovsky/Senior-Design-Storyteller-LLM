The Lustrous Lass was a small ship that sailed the Sea of Swords from the harbors of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
In the late 15 century DR, the Captain of the Lustrous Lass was the half-orcish woman named Harfang. Old elf named Dizby was the ships quartermaster, human Jorkens was a mate, and gnome Penita rounded up the crew.
In the , the crew of the Lustrous Lass sailed the ship to the Crone Island, somewhere in the Sea of Swords. There, Captain Harfang made a deal with the hag who inhabited the isle – Gloom Crone. The crew, especially doom-saying Old Dizby, who was recently made the ships quartermaster, thought the Crone Island an ill omen. Meanwhile Jorkens, who was disgruntled by Captain Harfang selecting Dizby for promotion over him, made an undisclosed deal of his own in secret.
The hag promised the half-orc Captain "enough gold to last the rest of her life," Harfang happily accepted. But several days later, the Captain decided to inspect the contents of the gold bags and found only six real gold coins – the rest was worthless. Harfang threw the fake gold overboard and immediately fell ill. She locked herself away in her cabin, trying to contain the disease and hiding away from sinister scratching coming from her baggage. The scratching came from a cursed imp who spread the deadly sea plague, that ended the lives of the entire Lustrous Lass crew in a bit over a tenday after the deal was made.
Soon after, the Lustrous Lass drifted into Baldurs Gates docks with everyone onboard dead of sea plague. The Flaming Fist mercenaries were dispatched to investigate the ship of the dead and placed a quarantine on the vessel. The Fists did not know what ended the crews lives, a poison or a disease. They found a basket of strange rotting fruits that they thought could be the cause, while one Fist detected an aura of wickedness around the Lustrous Lass, possibly becoming infected by the sea plague during investigation.
