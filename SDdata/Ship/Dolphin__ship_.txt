The '''''Dolphin''''' was the flagship of Lady [[Ryllae Windwalker]], commander of [[Evermeet]]'s navy.

==Description==
The ship had bright white sails bearing the sigil of Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]].

==History==
The ''Dolphin'' sailed widely across the [[Trackless Sea]], patrolling the waters around Evermeet alongside [[swanship]]s ships from the navy. Ryllae Windwalker took the vessel out further on occasion, going past the [[Wave Rocks]] and even within sight of [[Moray]] or [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshaes]], where its sighting was considered a good omen.
