        "mainbody": "The '''''Enforcer''''' was a modified [[angelship]] that served as the flagship and base of operations of the [[Enforcers]], a law-enforcement organization that hunted pirates and [[mind flayer]]s in [[Realmspace]] in the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ship's aft cargo hold had been modified from the original design, with the door and flooring removed to increase capacity and to facilitate access to the boulders that were stored there. A total volume of {{SI|21000|ft³|long=yes}} of rocks could be stored, which was more than what a typical [[giant]] could throw in a week. In addition, the ship's masts had also been removed to improve the field of view and fire coverage.\n\nThe angelship's original weaponry, which consisted of two [[ballista]]e and one [[catapult]], as well as the blunt ram mounted on the forward section of the main hull, was still in good condition during the ship's operation in the 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "The derelict angelship had been adrift for an unknown amount of time before it was found by the [[lizardfolk]] [[Frollth]] sometime in the mid‒14{{th}} centuty DR. Motivated to pursue justice in Realmspace after several of his friends disappeared after being reportedly captured by mind flayers, Frollth assembled a crew to restore the ship and named it the ''Enforcer''.\n\nAs the flagship and base of operations for the company, the ''Enforcer'' could be found most of the time between [[Garden]] and [[H'Catha]], but would occasionally travel to the [[Tears of Selûne]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[ranger]] Frollth served as captain of the ''Enforcer'', as well as the company leader. The first mate was the [[frost giant]] [[Murray Coldstare]], who took care of throwing the rocks from the cargo hold and was also responsible for replenishing the ship's boulder supply when ashore. The nine remaining permanent crew members included three [[mage]]s, two [[priest]]s, and four [[fighter]]s."
