The '''''Krigvind''''', meaning '''''Warwind''''' in the [[Giant language|language of giants]], was the flagship of the [[frost giant]] [[Jarl]] [[Storvald]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Krigvind'' was well over 500 feet (152.4 meters) long and boasted a mast over 200 feet (61 meters) tall. Atop the mast was the ship's sail, which was in fact a ''[[pennant of the vind rune]]''. While the ''Krigvind'' required at least 20 giants to set sail to comfortably held twice that number.

It was essentially a floating fortress, and could not be damaged by armaments less-powerful than siege weapons.

===Defenses===
The ''Krigvind'' had four [[giant]]-sized [[ballista]]e that sat atop swiveling bases, two at each end of the ship.

==History==
After the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] was destroyed in the late 15{{th}} century, the frost giant Jarl Storvald sailed the ''Krigvind'' to reclaim the abandoned giant fortress of [[Svardborg]].

After Storvald reclaimed the fortress, he used the [[dragon]] eggs he found to blackmail the mated [[white dragon]]s [[Cryovain]] and [[Isendraug]]. The Jarl chained Cryovain to the deck of the ''Krigvind'' and used him to defend the ship.
