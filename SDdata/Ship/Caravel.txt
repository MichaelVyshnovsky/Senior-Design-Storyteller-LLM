A caravel was a medium-sized sailing ship used in Amn and Waterdeep and on the Inner Sea by Cormyr, Sembia, and Impiltur. They were less popular in Turmish and Chondath.
Typically  long at the keel and  wide, caravels usually had two or three masts and no oars. A caravels full deck was about  above the surface of the water, but it also usually had a small forecastle and sterncastle. The ship had a smooth hull, which was constructed around a strong internal framework.
Crew size ranged from a minimum of seven to fifteen and could carry up to a maximum of 30 to 50, including passengers. It could bear a load of 120 tons of cargo. A caravel could be armed with a large weapon (such as a catapult or ballista) but was not built to wield a ram. On the Inner Sea, the sails were usually square, but in Amn, caravels had triangular lateen sails which allowed the ship to tack into the wind.
Caravels were seaworthy and capable of deep sea voyages. Their sailing speeds were three miles per hour in light winds.
A typical caravel took three months to build within a small shipyard.
