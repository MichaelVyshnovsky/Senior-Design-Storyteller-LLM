A '''caravel''' was a medium-sized sailing ship used in [[Amn]] and [[Waterdeep]] and on the [[Inner Sea]] by [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and [[Impiltur]]. They were less popular in [[Turmish]] and [[Chondath]].

==Description==
Typically {{SIrange|60|70|ft|long=yes}} long at the keel and {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} wide, caravels usually had two or three masts and no oars. A caravel's full deck was about {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} above the surface of the water, but it also usually had a small [[wikipedia:en:Forecastle|forecastle]] and [[wikipedia:en:Sterncastle|sterncastle]]. The ship had a smooth hull, which was constructed around a strong internal framework.

Crew size ranged from a minimum of seven to fifteen and could carry up to a maximum of 30 to 50, including passengers. It could bear a load of 120 tons of cargo. A caravel could be armed with a large weapon (such as a catapult or [[ballista]]) but was not built to wield a ram. On the Inner Sea, the sails were usually square, but in Amn, caravels had triangular [[lateen]] sails which allowed the ship to tack into the wind.

Caravels were seaworthy and capable of deep sea voyages. Their sailing speeds were three miles per hour in light winds.

A typical caravel took three months to build within a small shipyard.
