A umiak was a type of cargo boat used in the Great Glacier region.
The umiak was a shallow vessel with a wide, flat bottom. It was renowned for its ease of maintenance and ability to navigate in shallow waters. Measuring around  in length, it possessed a remarkable capacity to accommodate up to twenty passengers, along with their hunting equipment and a few caribou carcasses, all while remaining afloat.
Despite its considerably lighter weight compared to a conventional wooden ship of similar proportions, the umiak possessed the ability to carry significantly more cargo. Its flexible walls allowed it to resiliently rebound from most obstructions encountered along its journey. In the event of a tear, the craft could be promptly repaired by sewing a patch made of seal skin. To enhance buoyancy during turbulent waters, inflatable seal skins could be affixed to the sides of the umiak, providing additional stability.
However, the umiaks flat bottom and tall sides proved challenging when paddling against strong winds. To overcome this obstacle, kupuk could be employed. A pair of kupuk in the water could effortlessly tow a fully laden umiak. Alternatively, a team of approximately 12-15 dogs stationed on the shore could haul the umiak using tracking lines, which should be at least  in length and attached to a single mast.
Constructed by sewing together seal or walrus skins, which were then stretched over a wooden or bone frame. As the skins dry, they contracted, resulting in a taut surface reminiscent of canvas. To ensure its durability, three layers of oil derived from seal or walrus blubber were meticulously applied, with each coat undergoing a week-long drying process. By the end of three weeks, the umiak was watertight and ready for use.
