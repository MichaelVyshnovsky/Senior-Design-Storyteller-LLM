'''''Wardragons''''' were a class of four massive magical warships that served as the flagships of the [[Evermeet]] navy.

==Description==
These enormous vessels were {{SI|600|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} wide, larger than even the [[giant]]-crewed ''[[Krigvind]]'' and ''[[Hvalspyd]]'' [[longship]]s. They had polished white hulls and large, ornate [[dragon]]-shaped bowsprits.

They were heavily armored and armed, and used innate magical propulsion rather than [[oar]]s or sails.Though described as being magically propelled with no sails or oars, the ship type is given statistics for having sails and oars  in ''[[Elves of Evermeet]]'', and is drawn as having a sail. Though relatively clumsy compared to other ships, no [[human]] watercraft on the [[Trackless Sea]] could challenge a ''wardragon'' in battle. In addition to the regular crew of 200 [[elves]], the ''wardragons'' could also carry 800 more marines, a complement of flying creatures such as [[pegasi]] and [[giant eagle]]s, and many tons of supplies. They also usually carried up to three [[catamaran (elven)|catamaran]] fast attack boats.
