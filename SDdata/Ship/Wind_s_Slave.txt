The '''''Wind's Slave''''' was a [[caravel]] active on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in [[1359 DR]]. 

==Description==
The ship had a crew of thirty five sailors. A single [[fire projector]] was used when combating other vessels.

==History==
The ''Wind's Slave'' was originally sworn to the service of the pirate [[Vurgrom]]. During a raid on the port of [[Teziir]] alongside the ''[[Stirge (drakkar)|Stirge]]'' and two other vessels, the ''Slave'' was captured by the defenders. It was then sent out immediately after with a new crew to intercept and capture the ''Stirge'', which had taken the merchant [[Mulnis Lenz]] and a special gift from [[Waterdeep]] intended for King [[Azoun IV]].
