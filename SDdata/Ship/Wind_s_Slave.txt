The Winds Slave was a caravel active on the Sea of Fallen Stars in 1359 DR. 
The ship had a crew of thirty five sailors. A single fire projector was used when combating other vessels.
The Winds Slave was originally sworn to the service of the pirate Vurgrom. During a raid on the port of Teziir alongside the Stirge and two other vessels, the Slave was captured by the defenders. It was then sent out immediately after with a new crew to intercept and capture the Stirge, which had taken the merchant Mulnis Lenz and a special gift from Waterdeep intended for King Azoun IV.
