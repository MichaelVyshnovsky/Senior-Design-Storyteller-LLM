        "mainbody": "The '''''Wave Wyvern''''' was the personal [[galleass]] of Grand Duke [[Farnig Seasilver]] of [[Marsember]].",
        "Description": "The ship earned its name from its figurehead, a depiction of a shiny, [[silver]]-scaled [[wyvern]] with an open mouth.\n\nAs were some large sailing vessels, the ''Wyvern'' was equipped with a number of longboats.\n\nThe ship's tiny brig was referred to as \"the Stink\".",
        "History": "When the city of Marsember was invaded by the [[Shadovar]], on [[Uktar 2]] of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the grand duke prepared his ship to sail to [[Elversult]]. While he planned to bring aboard both his wife and daughter aboard, Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver|Elira]] and Lady [[Arietta Seasilver|Arietta]], the younger [[Seasilver]] lady did not make it aboard.\n\nJust after the ship left harbor, the [[Prince of Shade]] killed the Grand Duke, took the ship as his own, and kidnapped Duchess Elira. Lady Arietta hired the [[gnome]] smuggler [[Falrinn Greatorm]], captain of the ''[[Lonely Roamer]]'', to sail after the ship and recover her mother. Under the cover of \"gnomish fog\" the ''Lonely Roamer'' intercepted the ''Wyvern'', and the senior noblewoman was rescued.\n\nA short time later, the ''Lonely Roamer'' was destroyed by a massive leviathan, the ''Wave Wyvern'' was promised to Captain Greatorm as recompense for his efforts. Greatorm sailed the ship to the city of [[Westgate]], so Duchess Elira could be safely delivered to her family by the [[Marsember Watch|Marsember watchman]] [[Jang]]."
