The '''Narwhal''' was a stolen [[galleon]] from the [[Cormyr]]ean [[Blue Dragons|armada]] and later repurposed for both piracy and as the centerpiece of the [[Refuge Bay Trading Company]] fleet.<ref name=TJoC-p28> At some point after [[1362 DR]]<ref group="note">The exact year of the [[Narwhal (galleon)|Narwhal]]'s wrecking in the jungle is unspecified, as is the cause. Thus, we can reasonably infer that it occurred after [[1362 DR]], the period during which the events of [[The Ring of Winter (novel)|The Ring of Winter]] transpire, and when the ship was still actively navigating., it ended up upside down in the middle of the [[Chult]]an jungle due to a dysfunction in [[magic]].<ref name=ToA-p84>

==History==
Originally, the ship belonged to Cormyr's navy. Sometime before 1362 DR, Captain [[Bawr]] assembled a fleet of pirate ships on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and took the galleon by force. The pirate later cut a deal with the masters of [[Zhentil Keep]], who provided a group of very muscular [[giants]] to take on the task of moving the ''Narwhal'' across [[Faer√ªn]], all the way from the [[Inner Sea]] to the [[Sword Coast]].<ref name=TRoW-p57>

The ship was used for both piracy and high-paying cargo transports for the Refuge Bay Trading Company. Its primary goods included near-priceless [[teak]] and [[ivory]] from Chult.<ref name=TRoW-p57 />

In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, [[Artus Cimber]] and [[Hydel Pontifax]] sailed from [[Baldur's Gate]] to Chult aboard the ''Narwhal'', seeking the legendary ''[[Ring of Winter]]''. Unknowingly to them, their adversary [[Kaverin Ebonhand]] boarded the ship with them, in order to steal information and, eventually, find the ring before them. As the journey neared its conclusion near the shores of [[Refuge Bay]], the ship encountered [[Aremag]], a [[dragon turtle]], who unlawfully demanded a tribute despite its prior agreement with Bawr and the Refuge Bay Trading Company. While enraged by this breach, Bawr offered Artus Cimber as a payment to Aremag. However, Artus was protected by an enchanted [[Mulhorand]]i medallion housing a powerful ''guardian phantom'' named [[Skuld (phantom)|Skuld]]. When Bawr, transformed into a monstrous reptile-looking creature, attacked Artus, Skuld intervened, overpowering the captain. In the ensuing struggle, Bawr was thrown overboard and consumed by Aremag.

Shortly after Captain Bawr's demise, [[Nelock]], a former officer of the ''Narwhal'', arise as the new captain.

In the late 1490s [[DR]], the wreckage of the ''Narwhal'' could be found in the middle of the Chultan jungle, approximately {{SI|20|miles|k|long=yes}} from the nearest coast, where it landed after getting placed there by a magical mishap.<ref name=ToA-p84 /><ref name=ToA-p39> A [[weretiger]] named [[Bwayes O'tamu]], cousin of the [[merchant prince]] [[Wakanga O'tamu]], was using what was left of the galleon as a hideout. He lived in the now upside-down captain's room, which was properly furnished. A group of [[vegepygmy|vegepygmies]] co-existed with the weretiger on the ship, feeding on what food he gave to them.<ref name=ToA-p84 />
