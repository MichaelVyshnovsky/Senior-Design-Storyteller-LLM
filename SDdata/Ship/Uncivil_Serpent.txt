}} 
The '''''Uncivil Serpent''''' was a pirate ship that sailed the seas of [[Faer√ªn]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The ship's reputation was preceded by that of its captain, [[Lekard Cadavrus|Lekard "Dead-Eye" Cadavrus]], a foul-smelling pirate who was motivated by revenge.

==History==
Originally captained by [[Murosko Sessprin]], the ''Serpent'' experienced a mutiny when its first mate, "Dead-Eye" Cadavrus, took over control of the ship ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1494}}.

After it was discovered that [[Tarina|Rhonda Thunderbell]] stole from the rest of the crew, the ''Serpent'' tracked her to [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]]. The ship docked at [[Gray Harbor]] while the crew searched the city's bars and taverns.
