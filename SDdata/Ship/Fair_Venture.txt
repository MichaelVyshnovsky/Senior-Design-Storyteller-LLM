The Fair Venture was a caravel that operated in the water around Sembia during the mid-14 century DR. It was owned by the merchant Golthond of Thesk.
In Flamerule of 1357 DR, after leaving port in Sembia the Fair Venture went missing while passing by the Pirate Isles. In response, Golthond sought to hire a group of mercenaries to clear the islands of the raiding sea-bandits.
