Catamarans were small, deadly warships used by the navy of Evermeet to patrol its waters.
Elven catamarans were fast double-hulled boats with oars and three main sails, and were often carried three at a time by larger swanships, dragonships, and wardragons. They had a standard crew of ten elven sailors which often included a spellcaster, and were equipped with two ballistae (one at the bow of each hull).
Catamarans could reach a maximum sailing speed of  per hour, and were intended for duties such as couriering, scouting, and harassing enemy vessels rather than direct combat. As they were small and lightly built, they were quite fragile and not the best at long oceanic voyages or rough weather.
