        "mainbody": "Thepurls Diamond was a sailing ship on the Sea of Fallen Stars owned by the lich Ebonsoul.  \nThe ship was attacked and sunk by pirates around the time of the Spellplague. It came to rest in around 200 feet (61 m) of water. In 1481 DR, the wreck was discovered off the coast of Aglarond by Pericolo Topolino, the halfling guildmaster of a powerful Delthuntle criminal guild. The choicest treasures were plundered by Pericolos expedition but they unwittingly released Ebonsoul from his imprisonment."
