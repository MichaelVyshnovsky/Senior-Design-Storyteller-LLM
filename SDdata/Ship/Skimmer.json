        "mainbody": "A '''''skimmer''''' was a type of watercraft built and used in ancient [[Netheril]], notably propelled by a captured being from the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].",
        "Description": "''Skimmers'' were boats or ships that were pushed along by an elemental being of air. Depending on the type ensnared, they had different maximum speeds: [[aerial servant]]s and [[tempest (creature)|tempests]] were the slowest (though still quite fast), [[arctic tempest]]s were slightly faster, and [[sylph]]s and fully fledged [[air elemental]]s were fastest of all.",
        "History": "''Skimmers'' were first developed as small, fast boats that the youths of Netheril used to speed dangerously across [[the Moss]]. When it became known that the Moss was home to lethal gas pockets that slew the joyriders, the Moss was abandoned and the ''skimmers'' were instead used to zoom across the [[Marsh of Deception]] and [[Escalade Rill]].\n\nOnce the magical technology matured, the principles came to be applied to other forms of watercraft. Large merchant ''skimmers'' on the [[Narrow Sea]] were used to transport cargo and passengers, and leisurely riverboat ''skimmers'' functioned as gambling halls and pleasure cruises that extracted money from patrons.\n\nLate in Netheril's history, a variant was being developed that used other [[planar]] beings, but they had an almost even chance of ''[[gate|gating]]'' the user to the creature's home planeâ€”a most unpleasant fate."
