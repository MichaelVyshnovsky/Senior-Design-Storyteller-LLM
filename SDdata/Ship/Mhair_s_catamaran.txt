Mhairs catamaran was a personal watercraft operated by Mhair, an apathetic man who saved his passions for kayaking and cartography.
The catamaran was built from a pair of wooden kayaks rigged together with a platform across the middle. It had space for eight passengers plus Mhair himself, who pushed the boat along with a pole.
Mhair used his catamaran to transport mind-controlled victims from the Sharran Temple of Mystra in Wheloon across the Wyvernflow river, so that they could be sent onwards to the Lost Refuge. The catamaran was kept in the secret underground boathouse beneath the temple, alongside the prison cells and Mhairs kayak. Mhair would take it through a short underground passage at night onto the river.
Prisoners who rode upon the boat included Dava, Tholwick Styles, Halish, Mendios, Durgen Glintstone, Kareem Hastith, Smote, and Zephan. The pirate Veera Wavecrest was likely rescued by adventurers before being forced across.
