A ship of chaos was a vessel that could travel the planes. It sailed between planes on winds of chaos and fed on souls.
It was not clear whether all ships of chaos were formed more or less the same, or, as the name implied, each one was different. The ship of chaos recovered by Quenthel Baenre  in 1373 DR in the Lake of Shadows  (previously captained by the uridezu Raashub) was bone white with three masts and tattered sails. The ships lines were made of intestine. There was a maw in the hold of the ship through which the crew fed souls (generally manes) to power the ship. The tiller of the ship appeared to be formed out of a dragon wing. The deck was of powdered and compressed bone. The rudder was a sickle blade. The sails of the ship were made of human skin.
Ships of chaos were driven through mental control. If the ship of chaos didnt accept the pilot, he or she was killed.
