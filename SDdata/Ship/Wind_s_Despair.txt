The '''''Wind's Despair''''' was the personal [[caravel]] of [[Quelzur Naismen]], a [[pirate|piratical]] exiled [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The vessel had an average crew of 17 sailors and two medium [[ballista]]e. Although not a good captain, Quelzur's survival was guaranteed by his possession of a ''[[censer for summoning air elementals]]'', which he used to fill the sails and ensure that the ''Wind's Despair'' always sailed at full speed, no matter the weather conditions.
