The Winds Despair was the personal caravel of Quelzur Naismen, a piratical exiled Red Wizard of Thay in the 14 century DR.
The vessel had an average crew of 17 sailors and two medium ballistae. Although not a good captain, Quelzurs survival was guaranteed by his possession of a censer for summoning air elementals, which he used to fill the sails and ensure that the Winds Despair always sailed at full speed, no matter the weather conditions.
