'''''Jié Zuò''''', meaning "masterpiece", was a ship built by the [[Cormyr]]ean engineer [[Ivar Devorast]] for the [[Shou]] merchant [[Ran Ai Yu]]. It was a unique vessel that was built with [[ceramic]] tiles on its hull.

==History==
Ran Ai Yu was a Shou merchant who traveled by sea across [[Toril]] with her crew. She arrived in the [[Lake of Steam]], where her ship sunk in [[1362 DR]]. She and her crew survived the sinking and had to stay in the city of [[Innarlith]]. There she found Ivar Devorast, a Corymyrean engineer with ship-building experience and asked him to build her a new ship. Devorast took on the project and created a unique vessel never seen before in Toril that had ceramic tiles on its hull.

The clandestine [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]] offered to use magical means to transport her and her crew back to [[Shou Lung]] but she refused the offer because she distrusted magical means of transportation and preferred to sail the entire way. A few days later, Marek transported two [[Fury's Eel|giant demonic fish]] to Innarlith harbor to attack the boat in drydock. Ran Ai Yu and some others succeeded in killing the demonic fish.<ref>

Less than four months later, her ship was ready and she departed Innarlith. She named the ship ''Jié Zuò'' which meant "masterpiece" in the [[Shou Chiang|Shou language]].<ref group="note">''Jié zuò'', 杰作, is also Chinese for "masterpiece".

Devorast gave a copy of the ship's plan to Ran Ai Yu and destroyed his own copy of the plan. He had no intention of making more of these ships no matter how much money was offered to him. This proved to be true when, in [[1365 DR]], Ran Ai Yu returned to Innarlith with another Shou merchant accompanying her who wanted to buy his own ceramic tile vessel and Devorast refused to make another one.<ref>

[[Phyrea]] the daughter of Senator [[Inthelph]] sneaked aboard the ship at night when it was in Innarlith harbor in [[1365 DR]] in order to be near something that had been created by Ivar Devorast, since she was infatuated with him at the time. She was confronted by Ran Ai Yu on the deck and taken back to shore in a boat.<ref>
