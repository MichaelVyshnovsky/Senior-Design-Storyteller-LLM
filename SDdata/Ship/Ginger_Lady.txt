The '''''Ginger Lady''''' was a [[Shou Lung|Shou]] trade [[caravel]] that sailed across the waters of the [[Eastern Heartlands]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Ginger Lady'' was about {{SI|200|ft}} long, and its figurehead was carved into the shape of a [[dragon]]'s head.

==Uses==
The ship was used by Prince [[Kao Chou Tang]] and the Shou [[Ministry of Spices]] to transport [[gold]], [[jewel]]s, [[silk]] goods, [[spice]]s, and [[ylang]] blossoms to the [[Ginger Palace]] for trade to locates across the rest of the [[Dragon Coast]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the ''Ginger Lady'' was en route to [[Ilipur]] when it was attacked by the [[dracolich]] [[Hethcypressarvil]]. The undead [[black dragon]] wanted to kill Minister Hsieh aboard the vessel, so that he would not replace Prince Tang as the head of the Ginger Palace, and interfere with the Dragon Cult's [[poison]] trade in the region. Fortunately the ship was saved by the efforts of the [[Harpers]] agent [[Ruha]], and the crew of the ''[[Storm Sprite]]''.
