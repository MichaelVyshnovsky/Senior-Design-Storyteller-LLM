With multiple sails and complex rigging, it took a minimum crew of 80 to operate proficiently. The galleon had castles at fore and stern that were usually armed with a total of three large weapons (ballistae or catapults, for example).\n\nGalleons were quite seaworthy,{{Cite dragon/116/High Seas|13}}",

One such craft from the time of the [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]] was preserved after that nation's fall in the desert of [[Anauroch]] within the ruins of [[Hlaungadath]]. As late as [[1358 DR]], the [[lamia]] living in the ruins could not figure out how to operate the ship and make it fly again."
