The Enforcer was a modified angelship that served as the flagship and base of operations of the Enforcers, a law-enforcement organization that hunted pirates and mind flayers in Realmspace in the mid‒14 century DR.
The ships aft cargo hold had been modified from the original design, with the door and flooring removed to increase capacity and to facilitate access to the boulders that were stored there. A total volume of  of rocks could be stored, which was more than what a typical giant could throw in a week. In addition, the ships masts had also been removed to improve the field of view and fire coverage.
The angelships original weaponry, which consisted of two ballistae and one catapult, as well as the blunt ram mounted on the forward section of the main hull, was still in good condition during the ships operation in the 14 century DR.
The derelict angelship had been adrift for an unknown amount of time before it was found by the lizardfolk Frollth sometime in the mid‒14 centuty DR. Motivated to pursue justice in Realmspace after several of his friends disappeared after being reportedly captured by mind flayers, Frollth assembled a crew to restore the ship and named it the Enforcer.
As the flagship and base of operations for the company, the Enforcer could be found most of the time between Garden and HCatha, but would occasionally travel to the Tears of Selûne.
The ranger Frollth served as captain of the Enforcer, as well as the company leader. The first mate was the frost giant Murray Coldstare, who took care of throwing the rocks from the cargo hold and was also responsible for replenishing the ships boulder supply when ashore. The nine remaining permanent crew members included three mages, two priests, and four fighters.
