The '''''Aelusteen''''' was a ship captained by [[Imbryn Ultal]] that plied the oceans of [[Toril]] around the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

Imbryn Ultal sailed the ''Aelusteen'' between [[Sambar]], the capital of [[Lantan]], and the port city of [[Haunvaerune]] on the continent of [[Arandron]], to trade in [[Lantanna]] inventions. On one such trip, Imbryn gave passage to the disguised [[steel dragon]] [[Velsaertirden]] from Haunvaerune to Sambar.
