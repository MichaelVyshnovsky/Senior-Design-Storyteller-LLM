The Aelusteen was a ship captained by Imbryn Ultal that plied the oceans of Toril around the 8 century DR.
Imbryn Ultal sailed the Aelusteen between Sambar, the capital of Lantan, and the port city of Haunvaerune on the continent of Arandron, to trade in Lantanna inventions. On one such trip, Imbryn gave passage to the disguised steel dragon Velsaertirden from Haunvaerune to Sambar.
