The '''''Scavenger''''' was a large [[squid ship]]â€“type [[spelljammer]] that was captured and became trapped in [[Undermountain]].

==Description==
The ''Scavenger'' was built by [[mind flayer]]s. Its design was similar to standard squid ships, but considerably larger. The ship's hull was made of a resin with the same consistency as [[wood]]. Although capable of floating on water, the ship had no sails or any propulsion mechanism other than its unique [[helm of the Scavenger|helm]], which was particularly more powerful than common [[spelljamming helm]]s of the era.

The ship's bridge contained a chart with a map of [[Realmspace]] painted on the ceiling.

==History==
Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], while the ''Scavenger'' was orbiting [[Toril]], the [[wizard]] [[Halaster Blackcloak]] lured it into Undermountain through a ''[[gate]]''. He then stole the ship's spelljamming helm and hid it away, ignoring the ship's crew and leaving behind its existing treasure and provisions. With no way to escape, the marooned crew was left to their own resources.

==Inhabitants==
The [[mind flayer]] [[N'ghathrod]], native to the planet [[Glyth]], was the captain of the ''Scavenger''. It commanded a crew of four [[gray slaad]]i, who controlled the ship's [[ballista]]e, and sixteen [[orog]]s native to the planet [[H'Catha]] before the ship was apprehended.
