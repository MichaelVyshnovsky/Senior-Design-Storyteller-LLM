The '''''Revenge''''' was one of two ships constructed to begin the rebuilding of [[Zhentil Keep]]'s navy following the [[Fall of Zhentil Keep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

==History==
[[Gond]]smen were hired for a secret project during the ''Revenge''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s construction. The ''Revenge'' first sailed in [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. Later in [[Uktar]] of that same year it encountered five hostile ships from the [[Mulman]] navy. A grand battle ensued on the waters of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] and the ''Revenge'' was able to test the Gondsmen's secret projects. The Gondsmen had outfitted the ''Revenge'' with [[steel]] armor plating around the exterior of her hull, and a special steam engine to complement her sails. While the engine only worked briefly, it worked long enough to allow the ''Revenge'' to easily outmaneuver all five of the Mulman ships and destroy them in turn.
