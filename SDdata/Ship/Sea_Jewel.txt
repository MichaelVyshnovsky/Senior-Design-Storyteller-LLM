The Sea Jewel was a huge dromond and part of the Wraith of the Inner Sea privateer fleet in the midâ€“14 century DR. Based out of Reth, the fleet prowled the Chessentan coast, the Wizards Reach, and Inner Sea. It was a heavy marine support vessel 
By 1357 DR, it was captained by Bendensar and its first mate was Lorien, a mage. It had a complement of two-hundred crewmembers, one-hundred marines, and three wizards or fifty marines and seven wizards.
The Wraith were on a contract with Turmish when the Sea Jewel was scuttled by the former mercenary unit called the Agency. It sunk with all crew lost. Kreodo, leader of the Wraith, was still waiting for Turmish to replace the loss of the Sea Jewel in the early 1360s DR.
