'''Flying fortresses''' were enormous mobile siege weapons utilized by the [[archdevil]]s of the [[Nine Hells]], specifically those battling the countless [[demon]]ic hordes of the [[Abyss]] on the battlefield of [[Avernus]].

{{Quote|A weapon made for an [[archdevil]], ravaged in battle and ripe for plunder.|[[Cartographer|The Cartographer]].}}

==Description==
The massive hull of a fortress vaguely resembled the blade of a sword that dragged along the landscape point-down, standing anywhere from {{SI|150|ft}},

Within each fortress was a massive [[iron]] cylinder known as a soul intake, that ran through nearly the entirety of its hellish structure from its intake vent to a great cistern beneath the command deck. The intake provided power to the hellish device by siphoning [[soul]]s from the [[River Styx]] and utilizing them as a form of fuel.

The topmost level of the fortress was its command deck, Within this command center was the ship's "black bell", a {{SI|9|ft}} tall iron device that kept the flying fortress aloft in the sky and flying parallel with the ground. The deck did not have any manual controls for maneuvering and directing the fortress, as this was accomplished by a form of ''[[telepathy]]''.

===Armament===
Fortresses were equipped with unique machinery that aided in the devils' war efforts. Among these devices were those that could emit ''[[telepathic]]'' messages to all nearby devils within a {{SI|1|mi|k}} radius, disrupt all telepathic communication within that same range, or simply send messages to other flying fortresses.

==Activities==
Flying fortresses replenished their stores of tormented soul-fuel at [[Stygian dock]]s, refueling and service platforms located along the banks of the River Sytx.

==History==
Flying fortress were used by the devils of the Nine Hells as front-line siege batteries in the countless conflicts of the [[Blood War]].

==Inhabitants==
Fortress housed great crews of infernal combatants including swarms of [[imp]]s, [[barbazu]] shock troopers, [[erinyes]] to serve as officers, and even [[pit fiend]]s when so called upon.

==Notable Flying Fortresses==
* A crashed fortress that was carrying the ''nine [[adamantine]] rods'' that could be used to unlock the ''[[the Companion]]'' on [[Toril]].
* ''[[Zariel's Flying Fortress]]'', the gargantuan fortress commanded by [[Zariel]], Archduchess of Avernus.
