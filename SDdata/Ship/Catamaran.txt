'''Catamarans''' were a type of watercraft design that used twinned hulls instead of one, and could scale from small boats to large ships.

==Description==
By using two hulls together, a catamaran boat or ship achieved better stability and speed, though maneuvrability was more limited. It also suffered a lack of space inside the hull or atop the deck, reducing its capacity for passengers or cargo.

==Notable Catamarans==
* The naval [[Catamaran_(elven)|catamarans]] of [[Evermeet]] were fast boats carried by their larger warships, and were used for scouting and light combat duties.
* Flying [[catamaran (flying)|catamarans]] were delicate craft used as pleasure boats in low orbit or as launches from larger [[spelljammer]]s.
* A [[Mhair's catamaran|small catamaran]] boat was used by [[Mhair]] in service of the secret cell of [[Sharran]]s at the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]].
