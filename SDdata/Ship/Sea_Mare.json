        "mainbody": "The '''''Sea Mare''''' was a mercantile ship that sailed the waters around [[Chult]] during the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "After it washed ashore, the ship remained largely intact, though nearly entirely submerged beneath the waters.",
        "History": "Some time around the 1450's DR, the ''Sea Mare'' was attacked by pirates. All of its crew were killed and nearly all the valuables within were plundered. The pirates attempted to burn the ship at sea, but were unsuccessful due to a sudden storm.\n\nAs the captain of the ''Sea Mare'' died, she surrendered her soul to the [[demon prince]] [[Orcus]], and was transformed into a [[wight]] in response.\n\nThe vessel drifted off relatively unscathed, until became lodged in the rocks near [[High Horn (Snout of Omgar)|High Horn]] on the [[Snout of Omgar]]. The [[tortle]]s of nearby [[Ahoyhoy]] attempted several times to salvage anything from the ''Sea Mare'', but were entirely unsuccesful."
