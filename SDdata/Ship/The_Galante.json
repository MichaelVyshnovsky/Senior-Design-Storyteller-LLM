        "mainbody": "The Galante was Saemon Havarians ship, which was used to transport Gorions Ward from Athkatla to Brynnlaw.\nThe ship went under many names, which changed with time. It was a typical wooden vessel with a large ash-blue flag and contained a loud and boisterous crew.\nThe Galante transported Gorions Ward and his companions to the pirate town of Brynnlaw, in an attempt to save Imoen from Jon Irenicus at Spellhold. The ship had a set of signal lights which could be used to replicate signals of marauding pirates. Due to this feature, the Galante was often able to mimic a pirate ship, and thus avoid battle completely.\nIt was rumored that Aran Linvail from the Shadow Thieves guild of Athkatla, and Bodhi of its rival guild, had interest in this ship."
