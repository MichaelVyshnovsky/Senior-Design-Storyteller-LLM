        "mainbody": "The '''''Id Ascendant''''' was a [[nautiloid]] that was crewed by [[gnome ceremorph]]s and [[Gnome squidling|squidling]]s and used as a research vessel.",
        "Description": "The nautiloid was a semi-organic construction, mixing [[wood]] and [[iron]] with organic materials and reinforced with chitin. The ship was also circulated with a fluid created from the liquefied consciousnesses of several [[mind flayer]]s, which allowed it to operate telepathically. Its interior was lit by bioluminescent orbs and kept at a temperature of {{SI|50|F}} by the ship's life-support systems.\n\nThe ''Id Ascendant'' had three decks: the lower deck had a forward section that housed one of the ship's [[ballista]]e and an aft cargo deck equipped with several stasis pods designed to keep the crew alive during long voyages; the middle, or battle, deck contained the second ballista and the ship's propulsion crystal; and the upper, or command, deck housed the bridge with the [[spelljamming helm]] and the captains' quarters.\n\nThe nautiloid was equipped with a single spelljamming helm that could only be operated by mind flayers. Several of the ship's main functions could be operated by one or both of its captains.",
        "History": "In the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the ''Id Ascenant'' passed through [[Realmspace]] while it was being pursued by a [[neogi]] slaver ship.{{Cite adventurers league/The Fallen Star|9}} The ship crashed in southern [[Icewind Dale]] as a result of bad weather, while flying low to look for research specimens. The nautiloid sustained heavy damage and lost its propulsion system in the crash. \n\nThe nautiloid was seen plummeting from the sky from several locations across [[Ten Towns]], and was judged to be a comet. Following the crash, the ship emitted a rudimentary telepathic distress signal that could be picked up by a few of Ten Towns' inhabitants.\n\nThe crew was focused on getting the ship's propulsion back to work so they could return to [[wildspace]]. The captains surmised that a temporary fix would be to use a ''[[psi crystal]]'' to replace the nautiloid's destroyed propulsion system.{{Cite adventurers league/Volatile Thoughts|11-12}}\n\nThey allowed a group of adventurers and the [[giff]] mercenary [[Prook|Lieutenant Prook]] to use the ''Id Ascendant's'' spelljamming helm to charge explosives in the lieutenant's possession.",
        "Inhabitants": "The ship was crewed by the gnome ceremorphs [[Vorrin Q'uuol]] and [[Dredavex Sinfiz]] and the gnome squidlings [[Rin]], [[Rix]], and [[Zglarrd]]. In addition, it carried a number of creatures that the ceremorphs kept as pets or as test subjects, such as a [[flesh golem]], a [[bulette]], and two [[carrion crawler]]s. Following the crash, the bulette and the crawlers were released from the ship and allowed to roam the surrounding frozen landscape in search for food, as well as patrolling for visitors."
