        "mainbody": "The Id Ascendant was a nautiloid that was crewed by gnome ceremorphs and squidlings and used as a research vessel.\nThe nautiloid was a semi-organic construction, mixing wood and iron with organic materials and reinforced with chitin. The ship was also circulated with a fluid created from the liquefied consciousnesses of several mind flayers, which allowed it to operate telepathically. Its interior was lit by bioluminescent orbs and kept at a temperature of  by the ships life-support systems.\nThe Id Ascendant had three decks the lower deck had a forward section that housed one of the ships ballistae and an aft cargo deck equipped with several stasis pods designed to keep the crew alive during long voyages the middle, or battle, deck contained the second ballista and the ships propulsion crystal and the upper, or command, deck housed the bridge with the spelljamming helm and the captains quarters.\nThe nautiloid was equipped with a single spelljamming helm that could only be operated by mind flayers. Several of the ships main functions could be operated by one or both of its captains.\nIn the winter of the , the Id Ascenant passed through Realmspace while it was being pursued by a neogi slaver ship. The ship crashed in southern Icewind Dale as a result of bad weather, while flying low to look for research specimens. The nautiloid sustained heavy damage and lost its propulsion system in the crash. \nThe nautiloid was seen plummeting from the sky from several locations across Ten Towns, and was judged to be a comet. Following the crash, the ship emitted a rudimentary telepathic distress signal that could be picked up by a few of Ten Towns inhabitants.\nThe crew was focused on getting the ships propulsion back to work so they could return to wildspace. The captains surmised that a temporary fix would be to use a psi crystal to replace the nautiloids destroyed propulsion system.\nThey allowed a group of adventurers and the giff mercenary Lieutenant Prook to use the Id Ascendants spelljamming helm to charge explosives in the lieutenants possession.\nThe ship was crewed by the gnome ceremorphs Vorrin Quuol and Dredavex Sinfiz and the gnome squidlings Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd. In addition, it carried a number of creatures that the ceremorphs kept as pets or as test subjects, such as a flesh golem, a bulette, and two carrion crawlers. Following the crash, the bulette and the crawlers were released from the ship and allowed to roam the surrounding frozen landscape in search for food, as well as patrolling for visitors."
