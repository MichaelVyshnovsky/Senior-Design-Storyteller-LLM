The Rampage was a pirate ship out of Waterdeep that sailed between the City of Splendors, Lantan, and Chults Refugee Bay in the mid 14 century DR.
Sometime in 1361 DR, Rampage made its way to a tiny isle just off the coast of Orlil. The pirate vessels captain there came across a duo of well-spoken wombats as they were burying loot from their illicit activities. The wombats Byrt and Lugg spiked the scoundrels interests, and the animals were captured and caged on board of Rampage. The captain thought to sell the strange talking bear-pigs to Waterdeeps zoo at the end of the ships voyage.
The next stop on Rampages route was Refugee Bay. There, the pirates decided to strand the wombats, unable and unwitting to listen to Byrts unending theatrical soliloquy any longer.
