        "mainbody": "Ruathimaer, or starwings, were elven spelljammers unique to Realmspace. A small fleet of these ships was controlled by the Evermeet elves.\nStarwings resembled smaller versions of men-o-war and were powered by minor or major helms. They needed a minimum crew of 10 to operate and could hold a maximum compliment of 50 individuals without compromising their air supplies.\nIn the midâ€’14 century DR, a small fleet of six starwings was kept hidden in the small rocky island of Sumbrar, located about  east of Evermeet. They were crewed by highly trained elves but, despite being fully capable of space travel, usually stayed close to home in case they became necessary. They were kept secretly in reserve to carry out their primary mission of defending Evermeet, ready to be deployed so that they could attack enemies from above. Their crews kept utmost secrecy regarding the existence of the Ruathimaer fleet.\nIn the , with the scro invasion of Realmspace during the Second Unhuman War, the spelljammer fleet of Evermeet was deployed to reinforce the Elven Imperial Fleet in their efforts to repeal the scro. After more than a dozen battles, the scro forces were finally forced to retreat from the crystal sphere.\nIt was believed that the Ruathimaer had been designed by elves native to Realmspace."
