        "mainbody": "'''Ruathimaer''', or '''starwings''', were [[elf|elven]] [[spelljammer]]s unique to [[Realmspace]]. A small fleet of these ships was controlled by the [[Evermeet]] elves.",
        "Description": "Starwings resembled smaller versions of [[man-o-war|men-o-war]] and were powered by minor or major [[Spelljamming helm|helm]]s. They needed a minimum crew of 10 to operate and could hold a maximum compliment of 50 individuals without compromising their air supplies.",
        "History": "In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], a small fleet of six starwings was kept hidden in the small rocky island of [[Sumbrar]], located about {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}} east of Evermeet. They were crewed by highly trained elves but, despite being fully capable of space travel, usually stayed close to home in case they became necessary. They were kept secretly in reserve to carry out their primary mission of defending Evermeet, ready to be deployed so that they could attack enemies from above. Their crews kept utmost secrecy regarding the existence of the Ruathimaer fleet.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, with the [[scro]] invasion of Realmspace during the [[Second Unhuman War]], the spelljammer fleet of Evermeet was deployed to reinforce the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]] in their efforts to repeal the scro. After more than a dozen battles, the scro forces were finally forced to retreat from the [[crystal sphere]].{{Cite dragon annual/1996/Campaign Classics: The Scro|46}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed that the Ruathimaer had been designed by elves native to Realmspace."
