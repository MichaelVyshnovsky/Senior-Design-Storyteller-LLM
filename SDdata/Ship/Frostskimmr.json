        "mainbody": "The Frostskimmr was the ship sailed by Captain Lerustah Half-face and his crew circa the late 15 century DR.\nIt was a sleek longship, approximately  long, that held only a single sail and mast. If needed the Frostskimmr could also be propelled by oarsmen.\nThe deck of the Frostskimmr was open to the elements above. In an effort to retain warmth and offer some protection from rain and sleet, a makeshift shelter of unused sails was tethered atop by the ships crew.\nIn the 1480s DR, the Frostskimmr was commissioned by the Council of Waterdeep to transport a band of adventurers north from the city to the isle of Oyaviggaton in the Sea of Moving Ice.\nThe ship was crewed by two score sailors that worked under the leadership of Captain Lerustah."
