        "mainbody": "The '''''Frostskimmr''''' was the ship sailed by Captain [[Lerustah Half-face]] and his crew ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "It was a sleek [[longship]], approximately {{SI|60|ft}} long, that held only a single sail and mast. If needed the ''Frostskimmr'' could also be propelled by oarsmen.\n\nThe deck of the ''Frostskimmr'' was open to the elements above. In an effort to retain warmth and offer some protection from rain and sleet, a makeshift shelter of unused sails was tethered atop by the ship's crew.",
        "History": "In the 1480s [[DR]], the ''Frostskimmr'' was commissioned by the [[Council of Waterdeep]] to transport a band of adventurers north from the city to the isle of [[Oyaviggaton]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The ship was crewed by two score sailors that worked under the leadership of Captain Lerustah."
