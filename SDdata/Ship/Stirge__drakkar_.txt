The Stirge was a drakkar pirate vessel operating on the Sea of Fallen Stars in 1359 DR. 
The ship had a crew of thirty pirates and sixty slaves used as oarsmen. A single fire projector was used when combating other vessels.
The Stirge was sworn to the service of the pirate Vurgrom, who sent it out in 1359 DR alongside the Winds Slave and two other ships to raid Teziir. They managed to capture the merchant Mulnis Lenz and a special treasure he carried, to be delivered from Waterdeep to Azoun Obarskyr IV. Unbeknownst to the Stirge, the Winds Slave had been captured during the raid and sent after it, with the two ships meeting in battle again shortly afterwards.
