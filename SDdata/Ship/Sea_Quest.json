        "mainbody": "The '''''Sea Quest''''' was a huge [[dromond]] and part of the [[Wraith of the Inner Sea]] privateer fleet in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Based out of [[Reth]], the fleet prowled the [[Chessenta]]n coast, the [[Wizards' Reach]], and [[Inner Sea]].\n\nBy [[1357 DR]], it was captained by [[Sturion]] and its first mate was [[Perithor]]. It had a complement of two-hundred crewmembers, fifty marines, and two or seven [[wizard]]s.\n\nIt was a fast attack vessel with a ram and reinforced hull. The mages used ''[[gust of wind]]'' spells on the sails to increase speed. The ''Sea Quest'' would cut off any ship that attempt to escape the Wraith fleet."
