'''''Valashar's Bane''''' was a ship in [[Cormyr]]'s [[Blue Dragons|navy]] in the 4th century [[DR]], sailing on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It was the flagship of the fleet and carried Crown Prince [[Azoun I]], until it was wrecked and a sunk in a storm in [[389 DR]], taking with it many great treasures.

==Description==
It was a fast-running [[cog]], swift enough to overtake pirate vessels on the [[Inner Sea]] along the [[Dragon Coast]], though it was not heavily armed.

As a wreck by the mid–14th century DR, the ship's wooden timbers had all rotted away and the [[copper]] fittings had rusted away. The only remains were [[coin]]s, [[nail]]s, and [[cutlass]]es, scattered about and buried under some {{SI|10|in|long=yes}} of mud, which protected from corrosion.

==History==
The ship was named in honor of Prince Azoun's victories over the realm of [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]] in the [[376 DR|Year of the Leaping Hare, 376 DR]]. It became the prince's pride and joy.

In the [[389 DR|Year of the Wooded Altar, 389 DR]], Azoun sailed ''Valashar's Bane'' to the [[Vilhon Reach]], on a trade mission to [[Arrabar]]. Prince Azoun and the trainee Royal Wizard [[Amedahast]] slipped away to explore [[elf|elven]] ruins in the [[Chondalwood]], where they ran into [[Dima el Qufis|Dima]], the self-proclaimed [[Djinni]]-Lord, a marauding mage. They killed Dima and took away his treasure and magical relics.

However, on the return voyage later that year, ''Valashar's Bane'' was hit by a bad storm on the Sea of Fallen Stars, which caught the prince and crew by surprise. The ship holed its hull on the rocks of the [[Neck]], around 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of the [[Darkflow River]]. Taking on water, the prince and his crew limped back as close to Cormyr as they could, before the ship finally sank 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the shore.{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}{{Cite dragon/407/Blades of Kings|31}}

Fortunately, no lives had been lost in the sinking, much to the prince's relief. He and all the crew escaped in smaller boats and landed on shore west of the Darkflow, a day later at dawn. Azoun described the moment as "the best gleaming dawn seen in Cormyr yet". However, he regretted the loss of ''Valashar's Bane'', which had taken the royal [[sword]] ''[[Ilbratha]]'' with it, along with lesser regalia and the treasures won by Azoun on the expedition.

To later generations of Cormyreans, ''Ilbratha'' became a symbol of the glory and bounty lost with ''Valashar's Bane''. It became one of the [[Cormyrean Swords of State|Lost Blades]], official pieces of Cormyr's regalia sought for by authorities and adventurers. However, the sword resurfaced very soon after when it was recovered by two fishermen from [[Teziir]], who sold it on.

==Location==
On the surface, ''Valashar's Bane'' sank 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the shore and 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of the [[Darkflow River]], just within the [[Lake of Dragons]]. It came to rest at a depth of around 95 feet (29 meters), on a rocky patch of seafloor, some 39 miles (63 kilometers) due east of [[Nalufaen]], a city of the [[sea elf]] realm of [[Naramyr]].

==Contents==
''Valashar's Bane'' was carrying some impressive treasures back to Cormyr when it went down, much of it taken from Dima the Djinni-Lord. These included:
* A good deal of treasure won from Dima;
* ''[[Ilbratha|Ilbratha, the Mistress of Battles]]'', the prince's enchanted [[short sword]], later recovered;
* A ''stone horse [[figurine of wondrous power]]'' taken from Dima, intended to be presented to King [[Anglond]] on his birthday; and
* The ''[[Silver Scimitar of Amahl the Mad]]'' and the magic ring ''[[Amahl's Mastering]]'', which Azoun and Amedahast kept hidden in a secret chest concealed within the captain's cabin and only they knew about.
However, at least one of these—''Ilbratha''—was quickly recovered. The rest were presumed to remain within the wreck and debris of ''Valashar's Bane''.
