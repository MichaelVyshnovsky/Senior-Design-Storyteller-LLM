Swanships were large but graceful warships used by the Evermeet navy.
These vessels were  long and  wide, propelled by sails and oars. They were heavily decorated with their bowsprits carved as swans, and the rudders, masts, oars, and spars carved or painted ornately by elven artisans. Their striped sails were emblazoned with the symbols of ancient houses and kingdoms, and the gunwales were hung with various shields.
Though heavily beautified, swanships were swift and powerful warships with excellent seaworthiness. They had a crew of 80 sailors, a normal complement of 20 marines, three heavy ballistae or catapults, a fire projector, and could be fitted with a ship ram. They were also typically protected with inscribed totemic images to improve the vessels performance, and carried up to three catamarans that could be deployed as escorts. They were usually deployed in squadrons of three ships, and served alongside dragonships and wardragons as they protected Evermeets shores and vulnerable civilian ships at sea.
