The Sea Stallion was an Impilturan galley that navigated the Sea of Fallen Stars and Dragon Reach in the midâ€“14 century DR.
It was wrecked along the western shore of the sea, near the docks of Scardale Town, in 1361 DR. During the occupation of Scardale in the 1360s DR, the catapults of the ship were manned by a Zhentish artillery team to control that region of the sea with artillery fire.
