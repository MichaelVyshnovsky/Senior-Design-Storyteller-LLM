'''''The Starcross''''' was a legendary lost ship that was a part of [[Alaghôn]]'s fleet.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|145}}, ''The Starcross'' took part in the siege of the city of [[Hlondeth]] by the armies and navy of [[Turmish]]. The armies of Alaghôn were outsmarted, and its navy was repelled by a fleet of mercenary buccaneers of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. In the battle, ''The Starcross'' was believed to have sunk to the bottom of the [[Farshore Strait]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Many claimed that the vessel carried [[gold]] intended to establish the treasury of Hlondeth after Turmish conquered it. However, that was never proven, and the ship became a legendary treasure. By the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''The Starcross'' and its booty remained unclaimed.
