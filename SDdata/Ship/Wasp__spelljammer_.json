        "mainbody": "Wasps were spelljamming ships designed by lizardfolk, similar in appearance to dragonflies and used primarily as pirate vessels.\nAlthough designed specifically for lizardfolk occupants, wasps had an appearance of poor and careless design. The central portion of the vessel was usually flooded for the crews usage and for storing pets and mascots such as sharks, octopuses, squid, or even eyes of the deep, as well as prisoners. The top of that section had a raised platform on which weapons could be mounted. The forward section contained the spelljamming helm. Crew quarters were spread throughout the ship.\nA wasp needed a minimum crew of eight individuals to operate and could support up to eighteen creatures without compromising its air supply. Lizardfolk command hierarchy was very loose the only official positions were the captain and the shaman responsible for operating the spelljamming helm all other crew members equally shared the remaining duties.\nWasps were primarily employed as pirate vessels. However, their low prices made them popular among adventurers. It was also common to see wasps converted into luxury vessels. When used by non-lizardfolk, the central pool was usually drained and repurposed.\nSome design variations were commonly found among wasps, such as a heavily armed version called the bee class, a version with an expanded cargo hold known as a bumblebee, and smaller versions modified for higher maneuverability."
