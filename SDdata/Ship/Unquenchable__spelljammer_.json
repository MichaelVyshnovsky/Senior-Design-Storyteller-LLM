        "mainbody": "The Unquenchable was a sidewheeler captained by a gnome named Wysdor.\nThe Unquenchable had a wide beam and was hundreds of feet long. It was constructed with a mixture of thick wooden planks reinforced occasionally by large sheets of metal. The vessel contained two massive paddle wheels slightly toward the aft of the vessel from the middle, which rotated when the spacefaring vessel moved forward, as if pushing against an invisible river. The ship had both a sterncastle and and aftcastle, both of which were enormous and looked off balance with the rest of the construction. These too were built of wood and reinforced with metal.\nAll in all, the vessel looked ridiculous to human eyes, as if had had been constructed by several designers who had not bothered to communicate with each other.\nDecades before 1361 DR, a group of Tinker gnomes had set out from Krynn to explore the reaches of wildspace. In another crystal sphere, they had encountered neogi and were so distraught from the encounter that they returned to their own sphere and planet. Their vessel crash landed on Krynn, leaving only a small number of survivors. These survivors included Wysdor and his brother Horvath. These gnomes oversaw the design and construction of a second spelljammer to replace the one that they had lost. This ship was the Unquenchable.\nIn 1361, the Unquenchable took on the First Pilot Teldin Moore and three gnomish admirals from Mount Nevermind, with the intent of protecting the magic cloak that the human wore. The original course of the Unquenchable was to travel first to the planet Devis in Pathspace and afterwards on to the Rock of Bral for a retrofit.\nShortly after leaving the planet, the captain requested that his brother take a small contingent onto a longboat to examine damage that they had taken during the earlier fight.\nTeldin and the four gnomes were soon separated from the Unquenchable, however, when it was attacked by space pirates while they were off-ship. The larger vessel damaged one of the attacking wasps and then took to flight. The five left behind on the longboat were later rescued by another vessel named the Probe, but the fate of the Unquenchable is not known.\n* Wysdor, the captain\n* Horvath, the navigator\n* Miggins\n* Saliman\n* Dana"
