'''''Falcon''''' was the name of the flagship of the [[Golden Legion]], an [[Amn]]ish mercenary company that invaded [[Maztica]] in [[1361 DR]].

==History==
Captain-General [[Cordell]] and his Golden Legion sailed westwards from Amn in pursuit of a new route to [[Kara-Tur]]. Their expedition included several ships, with the ''Falcon'' serving as Cordell's flagship. The ship sailed with the fleet from Amn through [[Asavir's Channel]] and stopped in [[Lantan]] to load up on provisions before sailing westwards. It continued its westward journey until it arrived at the [[Green Sisters]] archipelago in Maztica. The fleet then continued southwards until it reached [[Ulatos]], where it disembarked and the legion got into a conflict with the local [[Payit]] people that ended with the legion conquering their city, plundering their [[gold]] and slaughtering many of their people.

Captain [[Halloran]], one of Cordell's officers, was briefly held in the brig of the ''Falcon'' by Cordell shortly before the battle with the Payit, after [[Domincus]] accused him of being responsible for his daughter's death at the hands of the Payit. Domincus sent Captain [[Alvarro]] to secretly kill Halloran in the brig while the legion was disembarked on shore for the battle. However, Halloran overcame Alvarro, escaped his confinement and looted some of the possessions of the legion's mage [[Darien]] from her quarters on the ''Falcon'' before escaping to shore.<ref>

An [[invisible stalker]] attempted to kill Darien as she slept with Cordell in his quarters after she had sent the same stalker to kill Halloran following his escape. She defeated the stalker, but the event made her realize that it had failed in its mission to kill Halloran.<ref>

Following the great plundering of gold in Ulatos, Cordell wished to move further inland to plunder [[Nexal]] when he learned of the wealth of this city. However, the assessor [[Kardann]], who had been appointed by Amn's [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] to represent their authority on the expedition, urged that they should return to Amn with the treasure and get more reinforcements before they continued further inland. Cordell, when he realized that some of his captains sympathized with Kardann's view, had all of his ships, including ''Falcon'', burned in the lagoon near Ulatos in sight of Kardann and the legion so that they understood that there was no going back.<ref>
