        "mainbody": "The Topside was a barge that sailed up and down the Fire River in the Vast in the late 14 century DR.\nThe Topside was a large, flat wooden ship with a cartel structure that resembled a simple tent stretched upon a wooden frame. The barge carried a sporadic selection of crates, boxes, and luggage, all covered by tarps, along with passengers and the crew.\nIn the late 14 century DR, The Topside was run by a rugged but friendly retired adventurer named Jedd. The crew was numbered at nine. At all times, three of them ensured the barge stayed on course while the rest focused on other tasks or took breaks. Circa the , The Topside was hired by Shauna Morden, the proprietress of the Tavern of the Garden, to transport a band of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff to the village of Dragon Falls. Along the several-days-long journey, Jedd entertained his passengers by telling them the story of the red dragon  Firewings and the group of heroes who slew the beast, giving the name to the village of Dragon Falls."
