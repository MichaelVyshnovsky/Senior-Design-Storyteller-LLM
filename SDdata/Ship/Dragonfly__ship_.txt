The '''''Dragonfly''''' was a [[carrack]], part of the fleet under the command of [[Cordell]] and his [[Golden Legion]] ''circa'' [[1361 DR]].

==History==
''Dragonfly'', along with the rest of the expedition vessels, sailed from the ports of [[Murann]] and collectively transported five hundred legionnaires, two hundred sailors, several dozen [[greyhound]]s, and [[horse]]s for the Legion's cavalry.

The expedition reached the [[True World]], the northernmost island of the [[Green Sisters]] on the 40{{th}} day of sailing across the [[Trackless Sea]]. By the 47{{th}} day, the Golden Legion visited several other archipelago islands while moving south, finally stopping at the island that would later be known as [[St. Ippen]].

''Dragonfly'' its demise after the construction of Fort [[Helmsport]] and the conquest of [[Payit]] in [[Maztica]]. When Commander Cordell was informed that the representative of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] [[Kardann]] was starting to show dissent and advised the Golden Legion's return to Amn. In a fit of cruelty or madness, Cordell torched all of his ships, including ''Dragonfly'', and offered Kardann to pick the ships that would sail him back to the [[Sword Coast]].
