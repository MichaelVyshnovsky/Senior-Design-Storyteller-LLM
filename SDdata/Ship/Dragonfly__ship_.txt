The Dragonfly was a carrack, part of the fleet under the command of Cordell and his Golden Legion circa 1361 DR.
Dragonfly, along with the rest of the expedition vessels, sailed from the ports of Murann and collectively transported five hundred legionnaires, two hundred sailors, several dozen greyhounds, and horses for the Legions cavalry.
The expedition reached the True World, the northernmost island of the Green Sisters on the 40 day of sailing across the Trackless Sea. By the 47 day, the Golden Legion visited several other archipelago islands while moving south, finally stopping at the island that would later be known as St. Ippen.
Dragonfly its demise after the construction of Fort Helmsport and the conquest of Payit in Maztica. When Commander Cordell was informed that the representative of the Council of Six Kardann was starting to show dissent and advised the Golden Legions return to Amn. In a fit of cruelty or madness, Cordell torched all of his ships, including Dragonfly, and offered Kardann to pick the ships that would sail him back to the Sword Coast.
