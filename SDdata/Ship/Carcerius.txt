The Carcerius was a slaving caravel that sailed to and from Chult during the early 15 century DR.
Some 75 years before the death curse afflicted the Realms, the Carcerius became trapped in a storm and crashed against the rocky shore of the Snout of Omgar. The crew of the ship was all swept away and all of the slaves within the hull drowned.
The wreckage of the ship remained strewn across the isle even decades later.
