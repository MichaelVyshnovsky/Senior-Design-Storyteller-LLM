        "mainbody": "The Dirty Dastard was a pirating vessel that was active in the seas around Chult during the late 15 century DR.\nAfter it was sunk, the Dirty Dastards mast and upper decks were stripped away from the rest of the hull. The belly of the ship became overgrown with barnacles and snails.\nAbout nine years before the death curse afflicted the Realms, the Dirty Dastard was sunk at sea. It washed ashore along the banks of the Snout of Omgar, and was looted by the tortles of Ahoyhoy shortly thereafter.\nSome time later, the wreckage of the Dirty Dastard was taken over by the sea hag Myldryd Urchinspine and her two giant crab minions."
