        "mainbody": "A '''junk''' was a type of sailing ship found mainly in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "A large sailing vessel, a junk had a flat bottom with a high keel and no stern. They had two masts supporting sails that were fully battened, that is, reinforced with [[bamboo]] ribs. The hull would be partitioned into several small compartments; watertight, these made a junk exceptionally seaworthy.\n\nJunks came in various sizes and for different purposes, with small junks, large junks, and war junks all known. A [[T'u Lung]] war junk might have a length of 60 feet (18.3 meters) and in ideal conditions sail at a speed of up to 80 miles (129 kilometers) per day, with a crew of only five. A typical large junk could have a length of up to 80 feet (24 meters), a beam width of 20 feet (6.1 meters), a height of 10 feet (3 meters) above the waterline and a draft of 10 feet (3 meters) below it. It sailed at 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) per hour.\n\nA small junk could carry 17 passengers while a large junk could carry 25 passengers; a [[horse]] or similar beast took up the space of four people. A typical large junk could carry up to fifty people, requiring seven crew on watch. It could carry a cargo of up to 160 tons (145 metric tons).\n\nA war junk could be armed with a [[ship ram]].",
        "Costs": "A small junk typically cost 300 [[ch'ien]], a large junk 500 ch'ien, and a war junk 800 chi'ein. A typical large junk could cost 15,000 [[gold piece]]s and took 3 months to construct.\n\nThe [[wu jen]] [[spell]] ''[[vessel]]'' could conjure a seaworthy junk from a single piece of [[origami]]-folded [[paper]] that could sail itself by magic. However, it only lasted a worryingly short time. Magical ''[[paper of forms]]'' could do the same.",
        "In Kara-Tur": "Junks were commonly used in the seas of [[Kara-Tur]] in the 14th century [[DR]]. For example, junks were used in [[Kozakura]]. The Imperial Navy had some twenty large war junks among lesser vessels.\n\nJunks were also sailed around [[Koryo]].\n\nJunks were used in T'u Lung, both by agents of the realm\n\nMerchant junks regularly sailed between [[Shou Lung]] and [[Wa]] and from T'u Lung.\n\nThe notorious [[wako]] pirates that plagued the seas regularly made use of junks. Usually disguised as traders, they often preyed on Shou Lung shipping to Wa.",
        "History": "Around the year 1200 by Koryoan reckoning, in Koryo, a great many refugees fled the city of [[Karak]] by junks, journeying down the coast to [[Tu Pe]]. They moored their ships at the Long Pier, creating a neverending traffic jam that trapped still more vessels and steadily grew and evolved into a veritable \"floating city\".",
