        "mainbody": "Star-Crossed Lover was a ship that sank at the Tower of Storms in the late 15 century DR.\nIt was a single-masted ship about  long. As a wreck, it sat on the northwestern edge of the rocks below the Tower of Storms in murky,  deep water with only its mast visible above the waves.\nStar-Crossed Lover sank after it was lured to the Tower of Storms by the bewitching magic of Moesko, an anchorite of Talos, who used his heart to create a beacon to lure ships to their doom on the rocks beneath the lighthouse.\nThe ships captain died when the ship sank. In life they had wielded a magic weapon, which remained clenched in their hands as their body was reduced to bones by hungry fish. The wreck was subsequently haunted by sharks, including the fearsome Daggermaw."
