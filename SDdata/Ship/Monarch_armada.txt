The monarch armada, also known as the monarch-class armada, was an obsolete version of the elven armada. Only six ships of this class were constructed before the design was abandoned shortly before the First Unhuman War.
Monarch armadas had orange-colored wings, the same color as the monarch butterflies from Toril.
The citadel was carved into the ships body, unlike with the modern armada, which had the citadel placed on top of it.
Unlike other elven spacecraft, such as flitters, men-o-war, gadabouts, and the modern armada design, monarch armadas were not grown from  starfly plants, but were instead made of a nonliving crystalline material. For that reason, they could not regenerate once damaged.

Shaping and growing the crystalline material of the monarch armada required a modified version of the ritual known as elaorman. The same ritual could be used to grow the other elven spelljammers from their seedlings.
In the mid‒14 century DR, the elven admiral Icarus commanded a large fleet of elven spacecraft that contained one monarch armada, among other types of spelljammers. Icarus operated exclusively in Realmspace.
Teela Darkcloud, a high priestess of Lolth, captured a monarch armada and modified it for drow use sometime in the mid‒14 century DR.
