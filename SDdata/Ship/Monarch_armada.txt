The '''monarch armada''', also known as the '''monarch-class armada''', was an obsolete version of the [[elf|elven]] [[Armada (spelljammer)|armada]]. Only six ships of this class were constructed before the design was abandoned shortly before the [[First Unhuman War]].

==Description==
Monarch armadas had orange-colored wings, the same color as the monarch butterflies from [[Toril]].

The citadel was carved into the ship's body, unlike with the modern armada, which had the citadel placed on top of it.

Unlike other elven spacecraft, such as [[flitter]]s, [[man-o-war|men-o-war]], [[gadabout]]s, and the modern armada design, monarch armadas were not grown from  [[starfly plant]]s, but were instead made of a nonliving crystalline material. For that reason, they could not regenerate once damaged.

Shaping and growing the crystalline material of the monarch armada required a modified version of the ritual known as ''[[elaorman]]''. The same ritual could be used to grow the other elven spelljammers from their seedlings.

==History==
In the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], the elven admiral [[Icarus]] commanded a large fleet of elven spacecraft that contained one monarch armada, among other types of spelljammers. Icarus operated exclusively in [[Realmspace]].

[[Teela Darkcloud]], a high priestess of [[Lolth]], captured a monarch armada and modified it for drow use sometime in the mid‒14{{th}} century DR.
