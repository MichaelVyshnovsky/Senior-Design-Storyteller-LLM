The '''''Buccaneer's Tear''''' was a [[skyship]] owned and operated by [[Company Yargo]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was captained by the debonair [[Shil Yargo]].

==Description==
The ship resembled a large galleon that took flight in the sky rather than across the waves of the Realms.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Shil and her crew navigated the ''Buccaneer's Tear'' from the city of [[Neverwinter]] up to [[Pirates' Skyhold]] in order to investigate rumors about lost skyships found on the soaring [[earthmote]].
