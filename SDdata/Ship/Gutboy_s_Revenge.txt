'''''Gutboy's Revenge''''' was a relatively small cargo ship from the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Gutboy'' was a long two-masted cargo ship with its name proudly inscribed on the hull.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''Gutboy's Revenge'' sailed the waters of [[Maer Dualdon]] and the [[Shaengarne River]]. When Targos became besieged by the [[goblin]] and [[orc]] forces of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in [[Mirtul]] 1312 DR, ''Gutboy's Revenge'' was used to transport lumber to Targos for the construction of defensive palisades. The ship was targeted by goblin arsonists trying to cripple Targos by destroying its docks, but the invaders were slaughtered by a group of adventurers from [[Luskan]].
