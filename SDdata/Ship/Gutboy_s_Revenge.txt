When Targos became besieged by the goblin and orc forces of the Legion of the Chimera in Mirtul 1312 DR, Gutboys Revenge was used to transport lumber to Targos for the construction of defensive palisades. The ship was targeted by goblin arsonists trying to cripple Targos by destroying its docks, but the invaders were slaughtered by a group of adventurers from Luskan.
