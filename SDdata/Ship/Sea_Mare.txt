The '''''Sea Mare''''' was a mercantile ship that sailed the waters around [[Chult]] during the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
After it washed ashore, the ship remained largely intact, though nearly entirely submerged beneath the waters.

==Cargo== 
The ''Sea Mare'' held within its hull a sarcophagus carved in the shape of a [[demon]], that housed the mummified remains of an [[archmage]] that failed at achieving [[lich]]dom. Accompanying the preserved corpse was a [[scroll]] written in [[Abyssal]] and a non-magical staff that possessed a false aura of [[conjuration]] magic.

==History==
Some time around the 1450's DR, the ''Sea Mare'' was attacked by pirates. All of its crew were killed and nearly all the valuables within were plundered. The pirates attempted to burn the ship at sea, but were unsuccessful due to a sudden storm.

As the captain of the ''Sea Mare'' died, she surrendered her soul to the [[demon prince]] [[Orcus]], and was transformed into a [[wight]] in response.

The vessel drifted off relatively unscathed, until became lodged in the rocks near [[High Horn (Snout of Omgar)|High Horn]] on the [[Snout of Omgar]]. The [[tortle]]s of nearby [[Ahoyhoy]] attempted several times to salvage anything from the ''Sea Mare'', but were entirely unsuccesful.
