The Sea Mare was a mercantile ship that sailed the waters around Chult during the midâ€“15 century DR.
After it washed ashore, the ship remained largely intact, though nearly entirely submerged beneath the waters.
The Sea Mare held within its hull a sarcophagus carved in the shape of a demon, that housed the mummified remains of an archmage that failed at achieving lichdom. Accompanying the preserved corpse was a scroll written in Abyssal and a non-magical staff that possessed a false aura of conjuration magic.
Some time around the 1450s DR, the Sea Mare was attacked by pirates. All of its crew were killed and nearly all the valuables within were plundered. The pirates attempted to burn the ship at sea, but were unsuccessful due to a sudden storm.
As the captain of the Sea Mare died, she surrendered her soul to the demon prince Orcus, and was transformed into a wight in response.
The vessel drifted off relatively unscathed, until became lodged in the rocks near High Horn on the Snout of Omgar. The tortles of nearby Ahoyhoy attempted several times to salvage anything from the Sea Mare, but were entirely unsuccesful.
