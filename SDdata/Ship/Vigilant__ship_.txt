The '''''Vigilant''''' was a transport ship that belonged to the [[Mercantile House]] of [[Samargol]], and later, a towering shipwreck on [[Omgar's Teeth]] in the [[Samar Bay]].

==History==
[[File:The vigilant storm.png|thumb|''The survivors of the Vigilant, rowing to the shores of Samarach.''|350x350px]]
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Captain Lastri Kassireh sailed the ''Vigilant'' for the Mercantile House of Samargol, the merchant organization ran by [[Sa'Sani]]. The vessel carried trade goods and passengers between the [[Sword Coast]] to the [[Chult]]an nation of [[Samarach]]. On a fateful journey of 1374 DR, the ship carried a famed writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who did business with Lady Sa'Sani, her aide [[Luaire Farwander]], and a band of adventurers. The voyage was [[curse]]d with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels were ruptured, one of the crew – [[Kellen (sailor)|Kellen]] got drunk and died overboard, Volo almost got [[poison]]ed, and new ropes became frayed. All of these occurrences aboard the ''Vigilant'' were used by Luaire Farwander, secretly a [[yuan-ti]] saboteur and a cultist of the interloper deity [[Zehir]].

Close to the shores of Samarach, the ship's ill luck culminated in a dark and powerful storm. Captain Kassireh knew that the ''Vigilant'' was a strong boat and could weather even the direst whim of [[Umberlee]]. When the storm hit, the second mate [[Nerul]] grabbed the wheel, but another sabotage became obvious – the ship's wheel was stuck. The ship was fiercely battered in the storm, Captain Kassireh was knocked out and tossed overboard, many of the sailors and passengers perished, while a group of adventurers and Volo nagged to board a boat and row to Omgar's Teeth's shores.

The ''Vigilant's'' hull was cracked over perilous reefs, and jagged rocks of Omgar's Teeth and its wreck was washed ashore, rising  above the beach trees and sands. First mate [[Kadjin]] and the Captain promptly were captured by a gang of hungry cannibal [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s while surviving adventurers and sailors clashed with a warband of Batiri on the beach.

Volothamp Geddarm recorded the fate of the ''Vigilant'' in the [[book]] titled ''[[Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms]]'', written and released after his return to the Sword Coast.
