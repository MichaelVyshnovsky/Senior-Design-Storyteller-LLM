        "mainbody": "'''''Barracuda''''' was a smuggler [[frigate]] allied with [[Zhentarim]], active ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, Zhentarim hatched a nefarious plan to take over the city of [[Daggerford]] by installing a puppet leader, Baron [[Matagar Bugo]], and staging a winnable war to cement his rule and approval. Part of this plan included bribing the [[Mariners' Alliance]] and using the ''[[Shoreside Shipping Consortium]]'s'' target to transport army equipment via [[Delimbiyr River]] and through Daggerford into the hands of the [[orc]] horde that was to attack the city. ''Barracuda'' under the leadership of Captain [[Herab]] was routinely loaded up with illicit goods under cover of the night and transported the supplies to the hidden pirate cove along the [[Crab's Claw Coast]] and into the horde's hands.\n\nOne of such operations was witnessed by Captain [[Samuel Turgat]], whose boat, the ''[[Flyingfish]]'', was docked for repairs at the time. This information attracted the attention of the adventurer later known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who was untangling many plots that menaced the city alongside a [[Harper]] agent [[Astriel Shalyn]].\n\nThe hero was confronted by a duo of [[half-orc]]ish crew-members guarding the ship, [[Wierdnog]], [[Nobla]]. There were several accounts on how the adventurer gained access to the Captain's cabin past the half-orcs. Some claimed the hero slaughtered them, but others told a story of the hero's cunning use of a sleep-induced brew, possibly [[Fillian's Brew]], to incapacitate the sailors.\n\nInside, the Hero of Daggerford discovered Captain Herab's [[oil]]ed [[leather]]-bound ledger on his massive [[oak]] desk. The black book listed all the goods ''Barracuda'' smuggled, including [[splint mail]], [[leather jerkin]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[halberd]]s. The Captain was paid in [[gold]] and able-bodied slaves. The ledger also pointed to the location of the orcs' base along the Crab's Claw Coast, the adventurer's next goal."
