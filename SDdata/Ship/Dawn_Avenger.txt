The Dawn Avenger was a vessel that sailed along the western coast of Faer√ªn during the late 15 century DR.
The Dawn Avenger was captained by an aasimar who devoted their life to the god Lathander.
In the year before the death curse afflicted the Realms, the Dawn Avengers captain sailed to Chult, in order to hunt down malicious bands of pirates. Unfortunately, thick plumes of smoke from nearby volcanoes hampered navigation and the ship ran aground.
Only seven members of the crew managed to survive and make it to the shores of the Snout of Omgar. Eventually, they used their lifeboats to transfer over to the mainland jungles of Chult.
The fore section of the Dawn Avenger remained stuck between some rocks on the Snouts coast, while the rest of the ship floated out to sea. The native tortles scavenged everything of value from within its hull.
