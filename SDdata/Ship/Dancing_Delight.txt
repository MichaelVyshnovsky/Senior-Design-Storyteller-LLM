The Dancing Delight was a corsair owned by the Tabaxi captain Stands in Tar. The ship plied the Sea of Swords in the late 15 century DR, hauling goods for merchants as well as passengers.
The Dancing Delight was a fast and highly maneuverable sailing ship.
Circa 1491 DR, Valdi Estapaar, who was a member of the Leilon town council, was looking to hire a ship to transport a group of adventurers to the Thunder Cliff Caves. The caves at the foot of the Thunder Cliffs were used as a hideout by the Cult of Talos, which had previously attacked Leilon, and were only accessible by sea. The Dancing Delight competed with the Ice Floe for the job. Though the Thundercliffs were considered dangerous, the Dancing Delights captain Stands in Tar was undeterred. The adventurers then cleared the caves of the threats there.
Around the same time, the crew of the Dancing Delight was dissatisfied since their captain had been even more reckless than normal, resulting in pay cuts as merchants had begun to avoid employing the Dancing Delight and its crew for important and lucrative projects. This dissatisfaction eventually led to a mutiny.
