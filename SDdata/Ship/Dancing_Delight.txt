The '''''Dancing Delight''''' was a corsair owned by the [[Tabaxi]] captain [[Stands in Tar]]. The ship plied the [[Sea of Swords]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], hauling goods for merchants as well as passengers.

==Description==
The ''Dancing Delight'' was a fast and highly maneuverable sailing ship.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], [[Valdi Estapaar]], who was a member of the [[Leilon]] town council, was looking to hire a ship to transport a group of [[adventurers]] to the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]]. The caves at the foot of the [[Thunder Cliffs]] were used as a hideout by the [[Cult of Talos]], which had previously attacked Leilon, and were only accessible by sea. The ''Dancing Delight'' competed with the ''[[Ice Floe]]'' for the job. Though the Thundercliffs were considered dangerous, the ''Dancing Delight's'' captain Stands in Tar was undeterred. The adventurers then cleared the caves of the threats there.

Around the same time, the crew of the ''Dancing Delight'' was dissatisfied since their captain had been even more reckless than normal, resulting in pay cuts as merchants had begun to avoid employing the ''Dancing Delight'' and its crew for important and lucrative projects. This dissatisfaction eventually led to a mutiny.
