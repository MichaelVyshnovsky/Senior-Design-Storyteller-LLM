        "mainbody": "The '''''Rampage''''' was a pirate ship out of [[Waterdeep]] that sailed between the City of Splendors, [[Lantan]], and [[Chult]]'s [[Refugee Bay]] in the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Sometime in [[1361 DR]], ''Rampage'' made its way to a tiny isle just off the coast of [[Orlil]]. The pirate vessel's captain there came across a duo of well-spoken [[wombat]]s as they were burying loot from their illicit activities. The wombats [[Byrt]] and [[Lugg]] spiked the scoundrel's interests, and the animals were captured and caged on board of ''Rampage''. The captain thought to sell the strange talking bear-pigs to [[Waterdeep's zoo]] at the end of the ship's voyage.\n\nThe next stop on ''Rampage's'' route was Refugee Bay. There, the pirates decided to strand the wombats, unable and unwitting to listen to Byrt's unending theatrical soliloquy any longer."
