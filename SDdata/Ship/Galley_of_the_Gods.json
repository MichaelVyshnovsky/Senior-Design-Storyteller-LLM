        "Description": "The ship's prow was of a [[dragon|draconic]] creature with multiple heads chained togethor, symbolizing the Untheric pantheon's legendary victory over [[Tiamat]]. During times of war the galley was typically equipped with two ballistae on each of its sides, as well as a [[catapult]] on its rear.\n\nWhen fully crewed the galley was capable of moving at speeds of {{SIrange|15|25|miles|long=yes}} per hour",

Any friendly ship that was traveling alongside the galley would also possess these immunities.\n\nIn extreme emergencies, the ship could manifest the wings of a dragon and lift off from the water. However, this required at least 120 oarsmen crewing the ship.\n\nThe ship's draconic prow was capable of firing a {{SI|20|ft}} in diameter ''[[ball lightning|sphere of lightning]]'' at targets from up to {{SI|400|yards|long = yes}} away. However, in order to activate this effect the prow needed to be facing the desired target.",
        "History": "The Galley of the Gods was believed to have been created by the deity [[Enki]].\n\nThroughout their history, the people of Unther used the galley in countless naval battles. Most notably, it was part of the battle in which they were victorious against the navy of [[Narfell]].\n\nAround [[1357 DR]], it was docked in the nation's capital [[Unthalass]] when a group of pirates"
