The '''''Ratclaw''''' was an independent [[Sembia]]n [[caravel]] that sailed the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was captained by [[Strauph Omerehellin]].

==History==
In [[Ches]] of [[1357 DR]] the ''Ratclaw'' left the port of [[Selgaunt]], en route to [[Hillsfar]], packed with [[date]]s, nuts and [[olive oil]] from the cities of the south. While it was due to dock in the port city of the [[Moonsea]] eight days after setting sail, it failed to arrive at its destination.
