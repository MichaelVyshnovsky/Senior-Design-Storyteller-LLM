        "mainbody": "The '''Grand Dame''' was a magnificent riverboat that docked in [[Yartar]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Within the ship's cabin was a luxurious gambling den called the '''Golden Goose'''. Both the ship and the casino were owned by the Yartarran nobleman, and secret [[Kraken Society]] agent, [[Khaspere Drylund|Lord Khaspere Drylund]].",
        "Description": "The ship comprised three decks. The lower deck contained a small hold with provisions, along with 16 two–person seats that accommodated the ship's rowing crew. The upper deck held the ship's bridge and helm, cabins for both its crew and those of Lord Drylund, and a poorly–lit ballroom.\n\nLocated between the two was the main deck, that housed the ship's kitchen, a dining area as well as the Golden Goose gambling hall. Within the hall were a number of card tables and a large, [[gold]]-plated sculpture of a [[goose]]. Fitting to its name and decor, the casino used a type of [[wood]]en token as currency, also referred to as a ''golden goose''.\n\nThe ship featured elaborate decorations adorning its exterior and within the cabin. Ornamental lanterns lined the balcony of the upper deck, illuminating the deck below. Lord Khaspere's cabin featured exceptionally tasteless decor",
        "Activities": "The Grand Dame remained moored to the docks of Yartar from sunrise until sunset. The ship's crew and casino employees arrived just before dusk and the Dame's guests, namely aristocrats and other well-to-do individuals, were allowed on board shortly thereafter. \n\nEvery night, the Grand Dame slowly journeyed upstream for hours, giving the guests ample time to gamble, eat and drink, dance to music, and otherwise enjoy their extravagance. In the early hours of the day, the ships rowers turned the Grand Dame about, and it made its way back to Yartar around dawn."
