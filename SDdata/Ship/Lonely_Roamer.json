        "Description": "The ''Roamer'' was equipped with a small [[skiff]] that could be lowered to sea from its hull.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Falrinn sailed the ship from [[Marsember]] on a mission to rescue Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver]] from the clutches of the [[Shadovar]] who had stolen her family's ship, the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]'' [[galleass]]. He and his employer [[Arietta Seasilver]] formulated a plan to set anchor at a submerged [[earthmote]] located in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], using it as bait, Arietta's companions rowed a skiff over to the ''Wyvern''.\n\nUnfortunately the ''Lonely Roamer'' was lost to an enormous sea creature that tore it asunder. While Falrinn lost his ship, both he and most of his passengers managed to survive the ordeal. Lady Arietta offered the old smuggler the ''Wave Wyvern'' to compensate him for the loss of the ''Roamer''."
