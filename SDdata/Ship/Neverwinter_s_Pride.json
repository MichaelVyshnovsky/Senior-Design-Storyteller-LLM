        "Description": "The ship was about {{SI|80|feet|long=yes}} long and {{SI|25|feet|long=yes}} wide. It had two {{SIAdj|20|foot|long=yes}} masts, each topped with a small crow's nest reachable via [[rope ladder]]. Two [[ballista]]e were mounted on the rear of the ship.\n\nThe space below deck had {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes|adj=high}} ceilings and contained furniture, [[rowboat]]s, and supplies.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}},{{4e-time}} Lord Neverember loaned ''Neverwinter's Pride'' to a group of adventurers tasked with retrieving the ''[[Talon of Umberlee]]'' from the [[Tidescourge]] pirates based at [[Port Llast]]. To protect the ship, the adventurers were instructed to hide it in a nearby cove while they assaulted the pirates' floating lair of [[Murdershoal]] by rowboat. Unbeknownst to the adventurers, the ship was targeted by a group of [[Umberlee]]-worshiping [[sahuagin]] led by Baron [[Saarkrith]], who attacked the ship alongside a [[kraken]] that wrapped its tentacles around the vessel."
