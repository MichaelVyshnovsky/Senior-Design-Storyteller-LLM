The '''''Sea Horse''''' was a huge [[dromond]] and part of the [[Wraith of the Inner Sea]] privateer fleet in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Based out of [[Reth]], the fleet prowled the [[Chessenta]]n coast, the [[Wizards' Reach]], and [[Inner Sea]].

By [[1357 DR]], it was captained by [[Morgalshym]] and its first mate was [[Brawn]], with [[Curnetheres]] as the chief [[mage]]. It had a complement of two-hundred crewmembers, thirty marines, and five [[wizard]]s or fifty marines and six other wizards.
