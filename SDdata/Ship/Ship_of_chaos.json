        "mainbody": "A '''ship of chaos''' was a vessel that could travel the [[plane]]s. It sailed between planes on winds of chaos and fed on souls.",
        "Description": "It was not clear whether all ships of chaos were formed more or less the same, or, as the name implied, each one was different. The ship of chaos recovered by [[Quenthel Baenre]]  in [[1373 DR]] in the [[Lake of Shadows]]  (previously captained by the [[uridezu]] [[Raashub]]) was bone white with three masts and tattered sails. The ship's lines were made of intestine. There was a maw in the hold of the ship through which the crew fed souls (generally [[mane]]s) to power the ship. The tiller of the ship appeared to be formed out of a [[dragon]] wing. The deck was of powdered and compressed bone. The rudder was a [[sickle]] blade. The sails of the ship were made of [[human]] skin.\n\nShips of chaos were driven through mental control. If the ship of chaos didn't accept the pilot, he or she was killed."
