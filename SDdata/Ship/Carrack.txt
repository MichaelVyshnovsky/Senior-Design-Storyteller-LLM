A '''carrack''' was a large, multi-masted sailing ship used in [[Amn]] and elsewhere on the [[Sword Coast]].  It could carry many soldiers and was capable of deep-sea voyages. Carracks had both fore and aft castles on the main deck. [[Cordell]] had several carracks in his fleet on his [[Maztica]]n expedition. A carrack sailed the waters of the [[Whamite Isles]], at some point prior to the mass death of the population in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
