The '''''Coin Toss''''' was a merchant ship captained by the [[Tethyrian]] [[Tazlan Rilzeer]], but owned by the [[Waterdhavian]] noble [[Arilosa Adarbrent]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1485 DR]], Tazlan and the ''Coin Toss'' were docked in [[Neverwinter]] when they were hired by the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] to set sail in search of the ship ''[[Morkoth (ship)|Morkoth]]'' and its hostage King [[Hekaton]].

==Inhabitants==
Tazlan kept a crew of 15 [[human]]s of various ethnicities. Additionally, he had Tethyrian medic named [[Tharkil Morn]].
