The Coin Toss was a merchant ship captained by the Tethyrian Tazlan Rilzeer, but owned by the Waterdhavian noble Arilosa Adarbrent, in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1485 DR, Tazlan and the Coin Toss were docked in Neverwinter when they were hired by the Order of the Gauntlet to set sail in search of the ship Morkoth and its hostage King Hekaton.
Tazlan kept a crew of 15 humans of various ethnicities. Additionally, he had Tethyrian medic named Tharkil Morn.
