The '''''Umbolden''''' was a full-rigged [[cog]] that sailed the waters of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[Ches]] of [[1357 DR]], the ''Umbolden'' left the docks of [[Telpir]], stocked with dried fish and cheese, headed to the [[Moonsea]] city of [[Melvaunt]]. Before arriving, it was due to make a stop at a port in the [[Dragon Coast]]—either [[Scardale]] or a city south of Scardale—some 10 days after embarking on its journey. However, it was never heard from again.
