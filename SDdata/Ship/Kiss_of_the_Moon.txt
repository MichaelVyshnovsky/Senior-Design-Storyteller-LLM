The '''''Kiss of the Moon''''' was a famous ship of [[Waterdeep]] on the [[Sea of Swords]]. It was a raker. 

In the 1320s DR, it was used to defend [[Deepwater Harbor]] against an [[undead]] [[kraken]], but was sunk in the effort.

A beautiful and detailed model of the ''Kiss of the Moon'' was displayed in the hall of ships in the [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in Waterdeep. As of [[1370 DR]], it had been only recently added to the collection.
