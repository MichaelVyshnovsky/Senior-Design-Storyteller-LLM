'''Curseborns''' were [[drow]] who trained and unlocked more abilities than others.{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|40-41}}

==Culture==
Drow were blessed by [[Lolth]]. This gave them some abilities A curseborn was someone who learned to unlock more of his or her potential. However, the reason to do so and the source of a curseborn's ability were not very clear. Potential candidates included those that had latent abilities granted by Lolth that the curseborn unlocked, abilities that came into being because the curseborn expanded his or her existing abilities through training, or the desire for redemption revealing new avenues of power.

==Abilities==
A curseborn enhanced his or her existing Lolthtouched powers: the ''cloud of darkness's'' darkness incorporated umbral strands that hindered other creatures' movement inside the cloud, the ''darkfire'' did not just target one but up to three targets, and a curseborn learned to recharge expanded Lolthtouched powers, allowing him or her to reuse them.

Additionally, the curseborn unlocked new powers in the form of ''accursed flames'', which burned the target with mind-addling purple fire that made it hard for the target to act and defend him or herself, ''shadow stride'' that sped up the curseborn by allowing him or her to partially go into the [[Shadowfell]], and ''alluring lights'', which created a violet light that could be moved by the curseborn, which addled the mind of those looking at it and made them move towards it.

Whenever the curseborn used one of the above powers, their eyes lighted up and black spiders made of shadows crawled around and disappeared into smoke.

==Relationships==
Drow, in general, acknowledged curseborns to be favored by Lolth.
