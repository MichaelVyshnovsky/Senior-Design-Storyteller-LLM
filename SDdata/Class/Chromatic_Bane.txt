'''Chromatic Banes''' were [[divine]] champions of [[Bahamut]] who swore an oath to defeat the evil [[goddess]] [[Tiamat]] and her minions, especially [[evil]] [[dragon]]s. [[Chromatic dragon|Chromatics]], [[metallic dragon|metallics]], or dragons of any other kind who were evil or servants of Tiamat became targets of the Chromatic Banes.{{Cite dragon/378/Channel Divinity: Bahamut's Champions|63}}

==Abilities==
Chromatic Banes developed techniques that allowed them to resist draconic attacks and also helped their allies in battle against dragons. They also had access to a special [[spell]] granted to them by [[Bahamut]], ''platinum mantle'', which allowed them to [[channel divinity]] into a barrier to protect them and those with them against attacks that affected a large area, such as a [[dragon]]'s [[dragon breath|breath weapon]].
