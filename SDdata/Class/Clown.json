        "Activities": "These tricksters were fantastic scouts. Their role during special ceremonies was to represent specific mischievous [[spirit]]s while performing dazzling acrobatics and acting ridiculous. Their faces and hair were usually painted in vivid colors during performances. Their outlandish performances served to entertain, as well as to help cleanse the unconscious mind of anyone watching. These individuals were expected to entertain their fellows regardless of any personal crisis going on in their lives.",
        "Culture": "The Azuposi clowns organized into fraternities similar to how hunters and healers grouped together. They were generally beloved by their neighbors.",
        "Abilities": "A clown could usually get away with saying just about anything to anyone, provided they were wearing their ceremonial garb.",
        "Possessions": "A clown typically wore an elaborate costume when performing during a ceremony. Otherwise they wore normal Azuposi clothing. Clowns preferred wielding [[club]]s, [[sling]]s, [[dagger]]s, or [[short bow]]s."
