A scout was an adventurer similar to a rogue or ranger, preferring to stay hidden and attack from a distance rather than up close and personal.
They had varying roles, from leading an army through unknown terrain to working as a mercenary going solo to learn terrain for the payer. Usually they wore leather armor, as they relied more on speed and agility to outmaneuver an opponent.
A scout often used light melee weapons, such as daggers and shortswords, and a small ranged weapon, like a shortbow or hand crossbow. They fought dirty, preferring to end the fight quick and were generally they are proficient in stealth and lock-picking.
