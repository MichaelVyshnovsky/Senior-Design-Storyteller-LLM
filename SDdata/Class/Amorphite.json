        "Culture": "These specialty priests were primarily [[drow]] males, but females and members of any race who worshiped Ghaunadaur could become an amorphite.",
        "Abilities": "Amorphites were skilled at fighting in the dark or while blind. They were immune to all forms of natural and magical [[disease]] and [[poison]]. They could resist the harmful effects of [[acid]] and other corrosive substances once per day, but eventually became completely immune to such substances as their powers grew. Particularly powerful amorphites were immune to all forms of breath weapons and all [[spell]]s from the [[elemental sphere]]. Amorphites could armor themselves with a protective barrier that guarded them from attacks from any amorphous creature. In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, amorphites could cast ''[[mists of Ghaunadaur]]'', ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', ''[[amorphous form]]'', ''[[Elder eye (spell)|elder eye]]'', ''[[wall of tentacles]]'', and ''[[acid storm]]'' on a daily basis.",
        "Possessions": "Amorphites did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield in combat or the [[armor]] they could wear."
