        "mainbody": "Amorphites were specialty priests devoted to Ghaunadaur, the Elder Eye.\nThese specialty priests were primarily drow males, but females and members of any race who worshiped Ghaunadaur could become an amorphite.\nAmorphites were skilled at fighting in the dark or while blind. They were immune to all forms of natural and magical disease and poison. They could resist the harmful effects of acid and other corrosive substances once per day, but eventually became completely immune to such substances as their powers grew. Particularly powerful amorphites were immune to all forms of breath weapons and all spells from the elemental sphere. Amorphites could armor themselves with a protective barrier that guarded them from attacks from any amorphous creature. In addition to their normal spells, amorphites could cast mists of Ghaunadaur, Evards black tentacles, amorphous form, elder eye, wall of tentacles, and acid storm on a daily basis.\nAmorphites did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield in combat or the armor they could wear."
