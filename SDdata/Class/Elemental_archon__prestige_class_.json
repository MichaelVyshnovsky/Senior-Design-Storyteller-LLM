They believed the mastery of their favored element was a necessary part of their existence, and extolled the superiority of their element over all others.",
        "Culture": "These individuals were often single-minded in the devotion to an element. They were arrogant and self-centered, never working with those who wielded the other elements. Archons reveled in the opportunity to compete against these individuals, often creating spectacular and destructive battles during their conflicts.\n\nThey often wandered the lands to preach to the common folk and attempt to direct them to worship of the god representing their own element.\n\nMany [[genasi]] chose the path of an elemental archon in life.",
        "Abilities": "All elemental archons were able to summon forth three [[mephit]]s, with whom they had a strong empathic connection. \n\nAn archon's connection with its chosen element granted them a number of related boons and powers. They gained inherent protection from damage associated with their element, the elemental spells they cast became more potent, and they gained an edge in combat when connected to their element (such as being suspended in air, or while near an open flame).\n\nThe most skilled and experienced elemental archons actually transcended their mortal form and became an [[elemental]] in [[humanoid]] form. The physical body they knew was no more, and they gained all the abilities and powers of the elemental of their chosen type.",
        "Relationships": "Elemental archons were seen as prophets of sorts by the churches of [[church of Akadi|Akadi]], [[church of Grumbar|Grumbar]], [[church of Istishia|Istishia]], and [[church of Kossuth|Kossuth]]."
