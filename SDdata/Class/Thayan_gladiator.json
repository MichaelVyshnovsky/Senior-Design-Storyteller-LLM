        "classname": "Thayan gladiators",
        "mainbody": "'''Thayan Gladiators''' were [[monstrous humanoid]]s trained to fight in the arenas of [[Thay]]. They were awe-inspiring combatants that played an important part in Thayan culture, and the ever-present sociopolitical dynamics.",
        "Culture": "Thayan Gladiators were in heavy demand from the elite upper class of Thay, serving as a distraction from the day to day hardship and torment that arises from living in the realm of the [[Red Wizards]]. This demand for excellence and amusement gave the Thayan gladiators a tradition that made them the very best of their kind throughout the [[Realms]].  \n\nThey were often used as political pawns by their Thayan masters. Gladitorial matches could settle disagreements and even allow Thayan aristocrats to gain or lose favor with their masters.\n\nThe most powerful Gladiators found themselves as potential guards for Red Wizards or even the [[tharchion]]s. They were thought of as among the most loyal and ferocious protectors in [[Faer√ªn]]. A select few were either freed from, or escaped from their service and often took on the [[adventuring]] lifestyle.",
        "Activities": "Not all gladiators fought alone, some were granted the boon of fighting alongside an ally in certain matches.",
        "Abilities": "Gladiators were experts at observing their opponents' movements and actions in combat. This skill granted them a a definite edge in a battle.\n\nOnce they designated as a gladiator, the natural weapons of the monstrous creatures were enhanced by [[magic]]al means. They could be altered to inflict the same damage as [[weapon]]s coated with [[silver]], or for the more veteran gladiators, [[adamantine]]. \n\nGladiators' claws and horns could even be imbued with certain magical properties, such [[Item enchantment|magical enchantment]], and power to ''[[flaming|burst into flames]]'', ''[[frost|emanate coldness]]'', ''[[ghost touch|harm incorporeal creatures]]'', ''[[shock|conduct harmful levels of electricity]]'', or ''[[thundering|emit booming noise]]''. \n\nThe magical alteration developed further as gladiators continued to fight in the Thayan combat rings. After more time, their natural weapons could even be made to ''[[speed|deliver quick strikes]]''; ''[[wounding (weapon quality)|inflict great blood loss]]'';  ''[[flaming burst|burst with flames]]'', ''[[icy burst|ice]]'', or ''[[shocking burst|electricity]]''; further harm ''[[anarchic|beings of law]]'' and ''[[axiomatic|chaos]]''; ''[[disruption|destroy]]'' [[undead]] beings; or inflict ''[[unholy (weapon quality)|drain the life force]]'' from the living.",
        "History": "The 14{{th}} century merchant [[Varouk Pital]] treated his gladiators with some level of care. If they proved themselves as worthy in the arena, Varouk would offer them freedom and employment with his treasure-hunting expeditions.",
        "Members": "Thayan Gladiators are all monstrous humanoids who possessed natural weapons such as claws or horns. Among the various races whose members were abducted for the ranks of the gladiators were [[minotaur]]s and [[lizardfolk]] native to Thay, [[wemic]]s and [[gnoll]]s from the plains of the [[Shaar]], and [[yuan-ti]] that were taken from the far off jungles of [[Chult]]. \n\nUpon becoming admittance into the gladiators, they were presented to a Red Wizard of [[transmutation]], who began the process of adding magical enhancements to one of the gladiator's natural weapons.",
        "Notable Thayan Gladiators": "* [[Grogan Dal]], a minotaur gladiator who was among one of the select few that escaped the arenas of Thay."
