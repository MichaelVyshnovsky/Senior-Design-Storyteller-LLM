Norothor were specialty priests devoted to Deep Duerra, the Queen of the Invisible Art.
The vast majority of norothor were duergar, but members of all of the dwarf races, both males and females, could become a norothar.
Norothor were often also skilled psionicists or warriors.
In addition to their normal spells, norothor could cast morale, thought capture, augment psionics, spiritual hammer, deflect psionics, rigid thinking, augment psionics, cure critical wounds, mind blank, lower resistance, and mindshatter on a daily basis. They could detect psionics at will while concentrating.
Norothor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield. Chainmail or dwarven plate mail were the heaviest forms of armor that they wore. Metal armor did not hinder their psionic abilities provided they were not wearing a helmet.
