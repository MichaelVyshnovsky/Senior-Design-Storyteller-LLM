'''Norothor''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Deep Duerra]], the Queen of the Invisible Art.

==Culture==
The vast majority of norothor were [[duergar]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, both males and females, could become a norothar.

==Abilities==
Norothor were often also skilled [[psionicist]]s or [[warrior]]s.

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, norothor could cast ''[[morale]]'', ''[[thought capture]]'', ''[[augment psionics]]'', ''[[spiritual hammer]]'', ''[[deflect psionics]]'', ''[[rigid thinking]]'', ''[[augment psionics]]'', ''[[cure critical wounds]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[lower resistance]]'', and ''[[mindshatter]]'' on a daily basis. They could ''[[Detect psionics (spell)|detect psionics]]'' at will while concentrating.

==Possessions==
Norothor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield. [[Chainmail]] or [[dwarven plate mail]] were the heaviest forms of [[armor]] that they wore. Metal armor did not hinder their [[psionic]] abilities provided they were not wearing a [[helmet]].
