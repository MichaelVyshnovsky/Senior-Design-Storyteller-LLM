Lorekeepers were specialty priests devoted to Oghma, the Lord of Knowledge.
As with others of Oghmas clergy, lorekeepers spent their time either secluded within libraries or temples, spending their time studying, copying, and preserving lore, or out in the world hunting down the tomes and scrolls that filled their libraries.
Though they carried blunt weapons, lorekeepers preferred to wrestle during combat, a skill at which they were quite adept. They were also quite skilled in turning creatures native to the Outer Planes.
Lorekeepers gained access to several powers as they progressed in rank. They could identify items once per day so long as they were within a temple, shrine, or other area sanctified by Oghma. They could cast friends once per day and mass charm twice per tenday. Similar to their ability to identify, lorekeepers could cast legend lore twice per tenday if they were within an area sanctified by Oghma.
Lorekeepers were only allowed to use blunt weapons. They never used shields, but wore armor no heavier than banded mail. They wore the traditional kantlara which was made unique by their own sigils and incriptions. Lorekeepers wore a ceremonial box-like hats during special religious events held on sacred ground.
