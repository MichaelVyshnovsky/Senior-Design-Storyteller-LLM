'''Stormharbors''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Valkur]] who interceded on the behalf of sailors with the [[Valkur|Captain of the Waves]] who tended to be unpredictable.<ref name="WaPotR-p122" >

==Activities==
Stormharbors attempted to grow the strength of the church by attracting more followers by showing that Valkur could be counted upon to protect them against the wrath of both [[Talos]] and [[Umberlee]] while at sea. Valkur, however, did not always cooperate.

==Culture==
Stormharbors tried to best represent their god by maintaining poise and resisting the urge to anger quickly. They were reliable and patient individuals.

==Abilities==
A stormharbor could determine if inclement weather was natural or caused by a servant of Talos or Umberlee. Since [[dolphin]]s were sometimes a symbol of Valkur, all stormharbors could ''[[speak with animals|speak with dolphins]]'' at will. They could also summon a group of 1â€“4 dolphins provided the creatures occurred naturally in the body of water. A stormharbor could also ''[[shapechange]]'' into a dolphin twice per day. The change to dolphin form actually healed the stormharbor of minor injuries.

They could not [[turn undead]]. Given Valkur's fickle nature, there was a slight chance he would not grant a [[spell]] that the stormharbor prayed for.

==Possessions==
They wore tunics of shimmering blue that signified calm waters. They also wore white clerical stoles embroidered with gold dolphins, anchors, and sea birds for good luck. Stormharbors never wore [[armor]]. Their favored weapons were [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[cutlass]]es, [[trident]]s, or [[quarterstaff]]s.
