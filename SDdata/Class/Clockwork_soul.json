        "mainbody": "'''Clockwork soul''' [[sorcerer]]s were those individual whose [[arcane magic|arcane powers]] originated from the universal force of order, that permeated some [[planes of existence]] such as [[Mechanus]].",
        "Description": "The origin of these sorcerers' powers were evident by the 'manifestations of order' that appeared on or around their body. Some clockwork soul sorcerers were born with [[brass]]-colored skin or appeared to have ticking clock faces within their eyes. Yet others manifested spectral geometric figures, or even interlinking cogs accompanied with the phantom sound of whirring machinery.",
        "Culture": "Some of these sorcerers had ancestors who had involved themselves in the affairs of the [[modron]], and had even participated in one of the [[Great Modron March]]es.",
        "Abilities": "Individuals with clockwork souls strived to maintain order in the [[multiverse]]. By focusing their will for just a moment, these sorcerers could lessen the chance of any severely adverse or truly fantastic outcome that may have resulted from someone else's actions.\n\nAs stewards of cosmic law, clockwork souls could also manifest [[magic]]al barriers that prevented an individual from harm. They did so by drawing from what was known as the \"grand equation of existence.\" Those sorcerers that tapped deeper into their innate power could even link their consciousness into the never-ending mathematical calculations that originated from Mechanus itself.\n\nThe most powerful of these sorcerers could even conjure [[spirit]]s that resembled [[modron]]s or other [[construct]]s within a {{SI|30|ft}} cube. These phantasmal conjurations traveled as directed, healing the wounds of the sorcerer's allies, repairing and items or devices they passed over, and even nullifying any magic of a certain potency or lesser."
