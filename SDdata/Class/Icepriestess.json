        "mainbody": "'''Icepriestesses''', or '''icepriests''' for males, were specialty priests devoted to [[Auril]] whose hearts were filled with the Frostmaiden's frigid embrace.",
        "Activities": "These specialty priests composed about one third of Auril's clergy. As with all of Auril's clergy, the vast majority of these individuals were female. They spread the fear of Auril throughout [[Faer√ªn]], particularly in the northern regions and the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Abilities": "Once embraced by Auril, all icepriestesses were completely immune to the effects of all natural cold, and they were able to more easily resist the effects of magical cold-based attacks. They gained several magical abilities as they progressed, including casting the following [[spell]]s once per day: ''[[frost fingers]], [[frost whip]], [[ice blade]]'', and ''[[cone of cold]]''. Twice per tenday they could cast ''[[ice storm]]'' or ''[[wall of ice]]'', and once per tenday they could cast ''[[Conjure elemental|conjure ice paraelemental]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Icepriestesses wielded all sorts of blunt weapons as well as the [[ice axe]]. They were permitted to wear [[armor]] as heavy as [[chainmail]], though many enjoyed scampering around frigid environments with little clothing to showoff the blessing of Auril."
