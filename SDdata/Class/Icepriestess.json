        "mainbody": "cepriestesses, or icepriests for males, were specialty priests devoted to Auril whose hearts were filled with the Frostmaidens frigid embrace.\nThese specialty priests composed about one third of Aurils clergy. As with all of Aurils clergy, the vast majority of these individuals were female. They spread the fear of Auril throughout Faer√ªn, particularly in the northern regions and the Western Heartlands.\nOnce embraced by Auril, all icepriestesses were completely immune to the effects of all natural cold, and they were able to more easily resist the effects of magical cold-based attacks. They gained several magical abilities as they progressed, including casting the following spells once per day frost fingers, frost whip, ice blade, and cone of cold. Twice per tenday they could cast ice storm or wall of ice, and once per tenday they could cast conjure ice paraelemental.\nIcepriestesses wielded all sorts of blunt weapons as well as the ice axe. They were permitted to wear armor as heavy as chainmail, though many enjoyed scampering around frigid environments with little clothing to showoff the blessing of Auril."
