'''Windwalkers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Shaundakul]], the Helping Hand.

==Culture==
These specialty priests were both male and female [[human]]s, [[half-elves]] and [[Air genasi|Air genasi.]]

==Abilities==
Windwalkers were often skilled trackers or herbalists. Similar to [[ranger]]s, windwalkers could move without making a sound and hide themselves within shadows. In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, windwalkers could cast ''[[helping hand]]'', ''[[whispering wind]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[wind wall]]'', ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'', ''[[wraithform]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', and ''[[wind walk]]'' once per day. A skilled windwalker would never become lost unless transported to another region of [[Toril]] via [[magic]]. They practised their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat.

==Possessions==
Windwalkers did not have restrictions of the type of weapons they were permitted to wield in combat. The heaviest [[armor]] they wore was [[chainmail]] and some carried a [[shield]].
