Windwalkers were specialty priests devoted to Shaundakul, the Helping Hand.
These specialty priests were both male and female humans, half-elves and Air genasi.
Windwalkers were often skilled trackers or herbalists. Similar to rangers, windwalkers could move without making a sound and hide themselves within shadows. In addition to their normal spells, windwalkers could cast helping hand, whispering wind, unseen servant, gust of wind, wind wall, shield, wraithform, find the path, and wind walk once per day. A skilled windwalker would never become lost unless transported to another region of Toril via magic. They practised their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat.
Windwalkers did not have restrictions of the type of weapons they were permitted to wield in combat. The heaviest armor they wore was chainmail and some carried a shield.
