        "mainbody": "attleforges were specialty priests of the Church of Tempus who supplied the Foehammers faithful with the weapons and tools needed to wage war.\nBattleforges were all too eager to test their creations on the field of battle. Given the amount of time spent at their forge, most battleforges bore far fewer scars and other wounds received during combat when compared to other members of Tempuss clergy.\nAll battleforges were humans, gnomes, dwarves, or half-elves. Every item they created was a personal devotion to Tempus.\nBattleforges could use their keen eye to examine any weapon, piece of armor, or shield to determine the exact nature of their magical enchantment. If they wielded a non-magical weapon that they personally forged, a battleforge could use the weapon to strike creatures that were usually immune to mundane weaponry.\nThey could not cast spells from the animal, healing, or plant spheres. They also could not turn undead.\nThey never wore helmets. They favored plate mail worn with a red sash that ran diagonally across their chest to the hip. Their weapons of choice were warhammers and a variety of swords. A battleforges weapon and armor were provided to them by the Church."
