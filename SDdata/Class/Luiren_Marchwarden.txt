'''Luiren marchwardens''' were the protectors of the untamed border lands of the [[halfling]] [[Luiren|homeland]]. The threats they most often face were monsters encroaching from the wilderness or would-be invaders from neighboring lands.

==Responsibilities==
Marchwardens worked alone or in small groups,

==Abilities==
The marchwardens of Luiren gained intimate knowledge of the land they claimed and used this to maximize their abilities while serving as it's guardian. After developing a deep familiarity and connection with an area of land over the period of a month, a marchwarden would sanctify their territory. While in their march, wardens had increased morale, improved reflexes and could better discreetly observe incoming threats. They were even capable of [[detect evil|detecting evil]] and gained abilities like the spells [[land womb]] and [[easy trail]].
