        "mainbody": "Talons were specialty priests devoted to Malar, the Beastlord.\nTalons were both male and female and could be any race. The vast majority of talons were human, but other represented races included wemics, half-orcs, half-ogres, and other vile humanoids.\nTalons possessed honed survival skills, allowing them to accurately identify plants, pure water, and animals. They could also track animals by their spore. They could cast several spells on a daily basis including beast claw, rage, and animal transfer. Talons were immune to all mind-affecting spells such as charm person if cast by a woodland creature.\nIn addition to bludgeoning weapons, talons often wielded daggers or claws of Malar. Claws of Malar were always a gift from the church. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear."
