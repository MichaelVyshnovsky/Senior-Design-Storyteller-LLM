'''Hruggek''' ({{Pronounce|HRUG|ek|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was the chief [[deity]] of [[bugbear]]s, and was the god of ambush, violence, and combat. At one time he was an [[exarch]] of the [[greater deity|greater god]] [[Bane]]. Other gods worshiped by the bugbears included [[Grankhul]], the god of hunting, senses, and surprise; and [[Skiggaret]], the god of fear.

Prior to relocating to Banehold, Hruggek lived in a large cave in Pandemonium called [[Hruggekolohk]]. His home was adorned with the severed heads of his defeated opponents.

==Description==
Hruggek appeared as a massive, powerful bugbear, 12 ft (3.7 m) tall. He had great fangs and clawed hands and feet, and wielded a 10-foot long [[morningstar]].

==Worshipers==
===Clergy and temples===
Hruggek's [[priest]]s dressed in black and wore skulls on their heads. He was worshiped on the full moon in bugbear cave halls. Bugbears sacrificed the blood of their enemies to Hruggek every month.

Shamans of Hruggek could achieve the ability to cast up to 5th level divine spells.
