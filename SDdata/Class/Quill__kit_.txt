Quills were specialty priests of the Church of Oghma who collected and recorded knowledge.
Given the amount of time spent recording various forms of knowledge, quills were usually well-versed with the history of their region.
Quills prided themselves on their diligence to their duties. They usually possessed an impressive memory and had a pleasing speaking voice.
Quills usually had all of the items required to write magical clerical scrolls.
Spells from both the combat and necromantic spheres were denied to a quill, nor could they turn undead.
Quills dressed similar to holy singers with a white tunic and pants and a black gold-trimmed vest. Their hat was small and box-like. Many quills also wore a sleeve protector on the forearm of their writing arm to protect their clothes from ink stains. These were sometimes decorated and served as a badge of office.
They spent very little time with martial training, thus they usually only carried smaller weapons, such as daggers. Lighter armor such as leather armor could also be worn.
