        "mainbody": "'''Lugh''' was an interloper [[deity]] of art, commerce, travelers, and excellence who originated from another [[earth|plane of existence]].{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}}",
        "Description": "Lugh's [[avatar]] form was that of a tall man, young in age, either with or without a beard, who had very large hands. Sometimes his avatar specifically took the form of a shoemaker. Regardless, his avatar form never appeared wearing armor.",
        "Personality": "Lugh was a very self-confident deity, always in search of new knowledge and experiences &mdash; if a worshiper ever called upon him in a situation that he had never been in before, Lugh might respond by sending an avatar. He was also a great courter of women, consorting with the various goddesses of whatever land he traveled to, even managing to make lovers of his enemies.\n\nHe was also what one could consider the druidical ideal, more fully understanding druidism than any other entity.",
        "Abilities": "Lugh's avatar was immune to ''control'', ''paralyzation'', and [[petrification]] effects. He was also a powerful user of druidic magic, capable of casting nearly any druidic [[spell]]. \n\nWhat set him apart from others deities was his unique ability to mimic the attribute or skill of any being that he had ever met, typically doing so excellently, though not all of his skills rivaled those of other deities. Lugh depended upon this ability in any battle he had.\n\nSome of the fields of study that Lugh excelled at because of his ability included craftsmanship, history, sorcery, and story telling. He was also a formidable warrior.",
        "Possessions": "The avatar form of Lugh typically carried around a [[sling]], [[spear]], and a purse  &mdash; in desperate situations he was capable of firing his [[bullet|sling bullets]] rapidly. He also typically traveled around with either a [[chicken]], a [[goat]], or a [[tortoise]].",
        "Realm": "Lugh originally lived long ago in the [[divine realm]] of [[Tir na Og]], but once had had fully explored it he left to explore the [[multiverse]]. Only returning when he desired the company of his fellow Celts, during which he would live in the home of whatever Celtic goddess would take him in for the night.",
        "Relationships": "Lugh was often found in the company of the Celtic goddess '''Rosmerta''', who was sometimes his consort. He was also the brother of the Celtic deity [[Diancecht]].",
        "Worshipers": "The priests of his faith were permitted to wield slings or [[mace]]s. They wore a kilt as part of their priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the [[all sphere|all]], [[animal sphere|animal]], [[astral sphere|astral]], [[charm sphere|charm]], [[combat sphere|combat]], [[creation sphere|creation]], [[divination sphere|divination]], [[guardian sphere|guardian]], [[healing sphere|healing]], [[protection sphere|protection]], [[summoning sphere|summoning]], [[sun sphere|sun]], and [[weather sphere|weather]] [[sphere]]s. They particularly had access to the spells ''[[light]]'' and ''[[light|darkness]]'', but out to a radius of {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}. They also were capable of [[item enchantment|enchanting items]] once per week.\n\nLugh's priests were required to be highly skilled in the arts and well-traveled. They also had to either erect mounds to him or hold ceremonies for him atop low hills.\n\nAs a god of travel, Lugh was quite popular among [[planewalker]]s. And the more adventurous members of the [[Society of Sensation]] greatly admired him, wanting to emulate his \"never shying away from a challenge\" and \"try anything\" nature.\n\nIn some worlds where the Celtic pantheon was worshiped, Lugh was among their most widely worshiped members. Having numerous monuments where followers would come to pray for guidance in any of his many areas of expertise."
