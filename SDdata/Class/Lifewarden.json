        "mainbody": "lifewarden was a specialty priest of the Church of Chauntea who was focused more on the welfare of humans, demihumans, and humanoids.\nThese individuals did everything in their power to heal others and preserve life, regardless of the race or demeanor of the victim. Any being who had not recently attacked the lifewarden or any members of their group, or had not caused harm witnessed by the lifewarden, would be granted healing. \nGiven that their skills involved helping others, lifewardens were usually found in inhabited areas such as cities and town.\nLifewardens were skilled in healing others, the brewing of potions, and concocting antidotes for poisons and venom. The were usually able to correctly identify diseases and poison, allowing them to brew the correct countermeasure provided they had access to the necessary ingredients.\nThe cost of brewing any form of magical healing potion was halved for a lifewarden. Any healing spell cast by a lifewarden always produced maximum healing power in the target.\nSpells from the combat sphere were not accessible to a lifewarden. At least half of a lifewardens spell repetoire came from the healing sphere or necromantic sphere.\nLifewardens chose to wear simple outfits with muted colors. A green sash wrapped around their left arm, or a circlet embedded with a small green emerald in the case of high-ranking lifewardens, was their badge of office. They could only wear leather armor or padded armor and could not use shields. During combat they wielded either a staff or club."
