        "mainbody": "A '''lifewarden''' was a specialty [[priest]] of the [[Church of Chauntea]] who was focused more on the welfare of [[human]]s, [[demihuman]]s, and [[humanoid]]s.<ref name=\"WaPotR-p72\" >",
        "Activities": "These individuals did everything in their power to heal others and preserve life, regardless of the race or demeanor of the victim. Any being who had not recently attacked the lifewarden or any members of their group, or had not caused harm witnessed by the lifewarden, would be granted healing.",
        "Culture": "Given that their skills involved helping others, lifewardens were usually found in inhabited areas such as cities and town.",
        "Abilities": "Lifewardens were skilled in healing others, the brewing of [[potion]]s, and concocting antidotes for poisons and venom. The were usually able to correctly identify diseases and poison, allowing them to brew the correct countermeasure provided they had access to the necessary ingredients.\n\nThe cost of brewing any form of magical ''[[healing potion]]'' was halved for a lifewarden. Any healing [[spell]] cast by a lifewarden always produced maximum healing power in the target.\n\nSpells from the [[combat sphere]] were not accessible to a lifewarden. At least half of a lifewarden's spell repetoire came from the [[healing sphere]] or [[necromantic sphere]].",
        "Possessions": "Lifewardens chose to wear simple outfits with muted colors. A green sash wrapped around their left arm, or a circlet embedded with a small green [[emerald]] in the case of high-ranking lifewardens, was their badge of office. They could only wear [[leather armor]] or [[padded armor]] and could not use [[shield]]s. During combat they wielded either a [[staff]] or [[club]]."
