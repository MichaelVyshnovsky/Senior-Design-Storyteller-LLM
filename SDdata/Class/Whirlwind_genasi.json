        "mainbody": "Whirlwind genasi were those windsoul genasi who mastered their control over the element of air. They harnessed the powers of wind as powerful as those encountered during storms and hurricanes.\nWhile the air itself was a part of a whirlwind genasis heritage, it was also imbued into their soul.\nWhen a whirlwind genasi walked on the wind, they could actually fly. Similarly, they could form a zephyr that lifted up their allies and flew them as well, if over a short distance.\nAs they grew in power, these genasi could form a massive cyclone that encircled their body, throwing aside any person caught in its way."
