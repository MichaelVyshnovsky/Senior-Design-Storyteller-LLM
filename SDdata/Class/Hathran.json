        "mainbody": "Hathrans were an elite class of female spellcasters who ruled over Rashemen. Hathrans were members of the Wychlaran, also called the Witches of Rashemen.\nHathrans developed a bond with their land that gave them exceptional power, as long as they didnt leave their homeland. They had to adopt some strict rules, like wearing a mask to conceal their face when traveling in Rashemen or refusing to craft magic items (an activity that is restricted to the order of male spellcasters). They may have used circle magic. They often spoke freely with spirits and sometimes used their bond outside Rashemen as they grew in power.\nCohort Hathrans had cohorts that were either female ethrans or male barbarians.\nPlace Magic Hathrans were able to draw upon the power and spirit of Rashemen to cast spells that they had not prepared.\nGreater Command Hathrans were granted an ability similar to a quickened greater command.\n* Calhyar of the Winds\n* Dynaheir\n* Fonjara Galth\n* Fydra Night-Tree\n* Havarra Sorokevka\n* Imsha\n* Lady Yhelbruna\n* Nythra of the Seven Rivers\n* Sheva Whitefeather\n* Tamlith"
