        "mainbody": "Moralists or Clerics of the Faith Moral, were militant priests in Zakhara who served as the heart and fire of their church.Moralist was a cleric class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.\nMoralists priests could be male or female of any race. Males and females were usually segregated into separate buildings and sometimes even separate temples. All moralists were lawful individuals.\nThese priests were zealots. This distinction often led others to view them as dangerous.\nAll rules governing a moralists life were derived from their god. They tolerated ethoists and pragmatists of their own religion, but still believed they were not living their lives properly. They disliked other priests and despised magic-users.\nUnless approved by their god, all earthly distractions were avoided by moralists. They only mingled with non-moralists if given a direct order by their superiors.\nMoralists were stern and serious individuals at all times. They kept precise records of their accounts and actions in case they were ever called upon to defend themselves.\nMoralists always wore the official uniform of their church. Chainmail armor was usually worn underneath their uniform.\nMoralists received great support from any temple of their god. This support came in the form of shelter, food, money, recruiting warriors, and even having their own personal assistant.\nOrders could be given to any lower-ranking moralists and were expected to be obeyed to the word.\nAny order received from a higher-ranking moralist needed to be obeyed.\nMoralists tithed half of their earnings to their church.\nGiven their strict nature, moralists suffered socially when dealing with any non-moralists."
