        "mainbody": "The Pact of the Blade was a type of pact between a warlock and their patron in which the warlock received a distinctive weapon.\nThe warlock could create the magical pact weapon in their hand at will, with its type chosen each time it was created. They could only create melee weapons, If the pact weapon was out of the warlocks reach for more than a minute, it would vanish, but the warlock could simply summon another. It would also vanish if the warlock willed it, summoned a different weapon, or died.\nWith other invocations, a warlocks pact weapon could drink the life-force of those it struck to inflict more serious injuries, or they could move and attack twice as often with it than was normal.\nIn the 15 century DR, Pact of the Blade warlocks could be found in parts of the Sword Coast."
