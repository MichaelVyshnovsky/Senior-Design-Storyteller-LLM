'''Mistwalkers''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Leira]] who were masters of deception.<ref name="WaPotR-p87" >

==Activities==
Mistwalkers used lies and deception in their everyday lives. They carried this to the extreme by being deceptive about whether or not [[Leira]] was even still alive following the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Culture==
Mistwalkers were soft-spoken individuals who moved about like shadows.

==Abilities==
Most mistwalkers were skilled actors which helped them spin truly convincing lies. They found it easier to see through [[illusion]]s and resist the [[magic]] of a ''[[ring of truth]]'' when compared with normal people. They gained several powers as they advanced that could be used on a daily basis including ''[[phantasmal force]]'', ''[[improved phantasmal force]]'', and ''[[spectral force]]''.

Sunlight was a mistwalker's enemy, making it slightly more difficult for them to resist the effects of [[spell]]s. They could not [[turn undead]] like other [[priest]]s.

==Possessions==
Mistwalkers wore soft clothing that was either gray or flat black. They also wore a large hooded cloak of a different color and usually had their hoods drawn to hide their features. The heaviest [[armor]] they could wear was [[leather armor]]. For weaponry they usually preferred either a [[short sword]], [[dagger]], or [[garrote]]. They never wielded two-handed weapons. Their [[holy symbol]] served as an ''[[amulet of proof against detection and location]]''.
