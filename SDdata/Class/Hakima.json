Instead they served as tribal family protectors or even leaders.\nThese women owned a wide variety of clothing and other equipment depending on their wealth.\nHakimas excelled at reading the truth in others, extending to being able to detect magical illusions and shapechanging. This ability developed as the hakima progressed and gained wisdom.\nHakimas could not use magical items and scrolls as well as other clerics. They were only able to use universal magical items.\nHakimas could not turn undead like other priests."
