Business was their lifeblood. They could be found all over the entire continent of Zakhara. They often dealt in stolen goods.\nAs soon as they could afford it, merchant-rogues usually flaunted their wealth with extravagant clothing and other equipment.\nMerchant-rogues were able to buy in bulk from suppliers, gaining product at a much cheaper price than the commoner. Owning a business provided them with somewhat steady income compared others, though they did have to pay taxes and deal with corrupt tax collectors. Business was their lifeblood."
