        "mainbody": "'''Necrobanes''' were special clerics of the [[Church of Kelemvor]].",
        "Activities": "The duty of a necrobane was to seek out and destroy any [[undead]] creature. They halted the spread and destroyed animated corpses such as [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s. They also sought out undead souls, such as [[ghoul]]s and [[wight]]s, so that they might be put to rest.",
        "Culture": "Necrobanes held a burning hatred for all forms of undead. While they casually slaughtered mindless undead, they held pity for the restless souls trapped in undeath and considered it a compassionate act to free them.\n\nThis pity and compassion did not extend to beings such as [[lich]]s or [[vampires]]. They saw lichdom as a premeditated act and considered vampires to be among the most vile creatures.",
        "Abilities": "Necrobanes possessed several abilities to aid them in eliminating the undead. They were immune to the paralyzing touch of [[ghast]]s and ghouls. They also had increased strength when casting spells to defend themselves against [[shadow]]s, [[spectre]]s, wights, and [[wraith]]s. A necrobane's weapon did not suffer any damage when used against the undead.\n\nThey had the ability to identify any undead creature by sight, even those concealed by magical means. They also were capable of ''[[Turn undead|turning]]'' more undead at a time than normal.\n\nA necrobane had to kill an undead creature at least once every other [[tenday]], else they suffered weakness and fatigue. Necrobanes were not capable of casting any magic from the [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]] sphere nor of using any [[magical item]]s or weapons that duplicated the effects of necromantic sphere spells.",
        "Possessions": "Necrobanes wore black cloaks over their armor. They wore a circlet of [[silver]] and neck chain with the symbol of Kelemvor proudly displayed.",
        "Relationships": "Necrobanes loathed [[necromancer]]s, even if of the same [[alignment]]. Most interactions between them resulted in conflict."
