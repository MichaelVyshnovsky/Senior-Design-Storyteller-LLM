        "mainbody": "ecrobanes were special clerics of the Church of Kelemvor.\nThe duty of a necrobane was to seek out and destroy any undead creature. They halted the spread and destroyed animated corpses such as skeletons and zombies. They also sought out undead souls, such as ghouls and wights, so that they might be put to rest.\nNecrobanes held a burning hatred for all forms of undead. While they casually slaughtered mindless undead, they held pity for the restless souls trapped in undeath and considered it a compassionate act to free them.\nThis pity and compassion did not extend to beings such as lichs or vampires. They saw lichdom as a premeditated act and considered vampires to be among the most vile creatures.\nNecrobanes possessed several abilities to aid them in eliminating the undead. They were immune to the paralyzing touch of ghasts and ghouls. They also had increased strength when casting spells to defend themselves against shadows, spectres, wights, and wraiths. A necrobanes weapon did not suffer any damage when used against the undead.\nThey had the ability to identify any undead creature by sight, even those concealed by magical means. They also were capable of turning more undead at a time than normal.\nA necrobane had to kill an undead creature at least once every other tenday, else they suffered weakness and fatigue. Necrobanes were not capable of casting any magic from the necromantic sphere nor of using any magical items or weapons that duplicated the effects of necromantic sphere spells.\nNecrobanes wore black cloaks over their armor. They wore a circlet of silver and neck chain with the symbol of Kelemvor proudly displayed.\nNecrobanes loathed necromancers, even if of the same alignment. Most interactions between them resulted in conflict."
