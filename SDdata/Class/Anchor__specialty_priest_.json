        "Possessions": "While at sea anchors usually wore blue clothing suited for swimming. They never wore [[armor]] as it caused them to sink in water. Their land attire consisted of a blue-green body stocking with a white [[cloak]] for warmth. Especially distinguished anchors also wore a rare tiara made from black coral. Anchors favored [[trident]]s, [[harpoon]]s, and [[dagger]]s as weapons."
