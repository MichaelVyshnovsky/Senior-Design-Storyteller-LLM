'''Mystics''' were bizarre priests in [[Zakhara]] whose powers were rumored to move both men and mountains. Mystics often gained spiritual awareness or revelations through dance, meditation, or other eccentric means.<ref group="note">Mystic was a [[cleric]] class kit for the [[Al-Qadim]] setting.

==Requirements==
Men and women of all races could become mystics, though most of them were possessed of wild and chaotic natures.

==Role==
As free priests, mystics could worship any god they chose without conforming to the hierarchical society that other [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] priests were part of. This method often left them in direct opposition with [[Moralist|moralists]].

===Dervishes===
These mystics only gained their clerical powers after completing a chaotic dance.

===Anchorites & Hermits===
Meditation and peaceful solitude granted clerical powers to anchorites and hermits, often in the form of simple tasks or hobbies such as singing or taking a long walk.

==Possessions==
Most mystics were very poor when they first began their unique spiritual journeys but amassed and enjoyed wealth as their powers increased.

==Benefits==
Mystics attracted followers who were fanatically loyal to them as well as their religion.

==Hindrances==
[[Ethoist|Ethoists]], moralists, and [[Pragmatist|pragmatists]] regarded mystics with disdain.

Since mystics attained their clerical powers through a unique method, preventing them from performing their chosen method blocked them from their powers. For example, binding the hands and feet of a member of the [[Dancing Dwarves]] would effectively prevent them from calling upon their clerical spells.
