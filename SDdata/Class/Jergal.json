        "mainbody": "'''Jergal''' ({{Pronounce|JER|gul|refs=<ref>}}) was the seneschal of [[Kelemvor]], Lord of the Dead, whom he served just as he did [[Cyric]] and [[Myrkul]] before him. Jergal was the '''Lord of the End of Everything''', [[Faerûn]]'s original god of death before he eventually ceded his position. Caring for little besides an orderly accounting of the fate of the world as it slowly sank into death, the '''Final Scribe''' was the one who kept the records of the ultimate fate of all the dead. He was venerated under the name '''Nakasr''' among the successor states of [[Netheril]].\n{{Quote|The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position. Who among you shall rule?|Jergal conceding his divinity and throne to the Dark Three\n}}",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Jergal's favored manifestation was simply the sound of a closing book, carrying a chilling feeling of finality.\n\nNo matter the manifestation, when Jergal spoke, his voice was chilling and seemingly disembodied, echoing with the dry whisper of a tomb that had long been forgotten."
        },
        "Personality": "Although his nature was that he must be loyal to the office of death, he could subtly undermine the holder of that office if he or she was not true to the office's responsibilities.",
        "Relationships": "[[Bane]], [[Bhaal]], and [[Myrkul]] inherited most of the [[portfolio]]s of Jergal when he wearily stepped down from his position and then faded into near-obscurity. The death of those deities left Jergal in the service of Cyric and then Kelemvor; he worked well with Kelemvor, but retained his scorn for Cyric. He spent much of his efforts combating [[Velsharoon]]'s efforts to prolong life into undeath.",
        "History": "Jergal was an ancient deity, older than many of the greater gods of Faerûn. In the time of [[Netheril]], he was a greater deity himself, with the portfolios of the Dead, Murder, and Strife. With the long aeons, he became bored with his position of power, and allowed for three mortals, known as the [[Dark Three]], to each take up parts of his divinity. Bane assumed the portfolio of Strife, Myrkul the rulership of the Dead, and Bhaal the portfolio of Murder. Jergal himself faded from his great stature, and became a seneschal to Myrkul, a position he kept even after his master perished and first Cyric and then Kelemvor assumed his place.\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], Jergal was reported be found in a [[Gate-town|gate-town]] of [[Sylvania]], inviting visitors to a game of skull bocce in an undead club called the Afterparty.\n\nDuring the events surrounding the rise of the [[cult of the Absolute]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jergal manifested an [[avatar]] called [[Withers]] in a [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|temple]] dedicated to himself that had lain abandoned for over a century—or rather, interred his avatar within the temple at some point in the past so that the adventurers from the [[nautiloid]] would eventually awaken it. As Withers, Jergal provided magical support to the adventurers, in exchange for a pittance of [[coin]] compared to the usual cost of such services. He accompanied the group on their journey, but aside from resurrecting dead allies and summoning additional help when asked for, he did not intervene directly. However, he might have shown great kindness to the [[tiefling]] [[sorcerer]] girl named [[Arabella]], soothing the girl when she was distraught over the death of her parents, showing her a glimpse of her destiny that filled her with joy.\n\nAfter the war [[the Absolute]] rained on the city of Baldur's Gate and many of its citizens suffered [[ceremorphosis]], Jergal-as-Withers confronted a mural of his three inheritors—Bhaal, Myrkul, and Bane. Jergal explained that the souls of mortals vanished when they were transformed into Mind Flayers, thus failing to bolster their power, a fact that other gods had noticed. He expressed contempt for them, called them fools and finally dismissed them as \"vermin\". The god walked away from the mural claiming that the Dead Three will trouble the realms no more.",
