Noroghor were specialty priests devoted to Abbathor, the Wyrm of Avarice.
The vast majority of noroghor were either gold dwarves or shield dwarves, but members of all of the dwarf races, to include both males and females, could become a noroghar.
Noroghor were skilled linguists and animal trainers. They were immune to the fear aura created by all dragon species. Powerful noroghar were even immune to the breath weapon of a single type of dragon.
In addition to their normal spells, noroghor could cast efficacious monster ward, polymorph other on willing recipients, age dragon on a willing recipient, and flame strike on a daily basis. They could shapechange up to three times per day for ten minutes at a time into any creature they had personally seen. A noroghar could create an illusion at will that lasted as long as they maintainted concentration.
Noroghor only wielded bludgeoning weapons in combat. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear.
