'''Noroghor''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Abbathor]], the Wyrm of Avarice.

==Culture==
The vast majority of noroghor were either [[gold dwarves]] or [[shield dwarves]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, to include both males and females, could become a noroghar.

==Abilities==
Noroghor were skilled linguists and animal trainers. They were immune to the [[fear aura]] created by all [[dragon]] species. Powerful noroghar were even immune to the breath weapon of a single type of dragon.

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, noroghor could cast ''[[efficacious monster ward]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'' on willing recipients, ''[[age dragon]]'' on a willing recipient, and ''[[flame strike]]'' on a daily basis. They could ''[[shapechange]]'' up to three times per day for ten minutes at a time into any creature they had personally seen. A noroghar could create an [[illusion]] at will that lasted as long as they maintainted concentration.

==Possessions==
Noroghor only wielded bludgeoning weapons in combat. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
