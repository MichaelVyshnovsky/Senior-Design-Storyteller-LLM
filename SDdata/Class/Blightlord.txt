'''Talontar blightlords''', or more commonly just '''blightlords''', were corrupt [[Talontar]] priests reveling in decay, feared and reviled throughout the [[Unapproachable East]]. They sought to infest its forests with the same blights that had turned the [[Rawlinswood]] into a foul mockery of a forest. Most of them served as the [[Rotting Man]]'s handpicked lieutenants and emissaries, armed with the power to warp forest creatures to their own, sick purposes.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|82-83}}

Most blightlords had once been clerics, rangers, or even druids. Though some were drawn from other classes, such as the martial or the arcane, all who sought to become a blightlord needed considerable skill at divine magic.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|34-36}}

==Activities==
In {{yearlink|1372}}, the blightlords and their minions menaced [[Damara]], [[Impiltur]], and the [[Great Dale]], ensnaring creatures of the forest, particularly [[volodni]], and twisting them into their cause. The [[Circle of Leth]] was trying to stop them from expanding past the [[Rawlinswood]],{{cite book/Unapproachable East|86}}{{cite book/Unapproachable East|117}} The Rotting Man's secret weapon that time had been druids of the Circle of Leth, corrupted by Talona's Blight into blightlords.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|118}} The Rotting Man sent parties of blightlords into [[Fortress Narder]], hoping to discover the source of the puzzling, interesting blight found in the vicinity; it was not of their working.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|116-117}}

On a cold night of early [[Marpenoth]] in {{yearlink|1371}}, three blightlords had destroyed the village of [[Denderdale]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|125}} It was possible in 1372 DR that the blightlords' attacks on Damara's border may have driven King Dragonsbane to advance his borders further out, to make them more defensible.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|191}} Similarly, the [[Qu'encesta]] tribe of the [[Nar]] had plans to head south, through blightlord territory; the outcome of such a move was still up in the air.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|122-123}}

==Abilities==
[[File:Blightlord UE123.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A blightlord with friends.]]A curious effect of becoming a blightlord was, for a druid, that they no longer needed heed their vows against metal. More generally, they gained access to a unique priestly ability, the divine domain of the [[Blightbringer]]: granted by [[Talona]] alone and only to the blightlords, it granted them the ability to rebuke and command the [[blightspawned]] as if death had already claimed them. They also became completely immune to any disease, whether natural or not, and were granted a protection that no blightspawned creature could breach unless attacked first.

A blightlord that continued their advancement would find that their animal companions, if they had them, would become taken by blight, becoming blightspawned monsters. The blightlord would, along with their advancement in the mysteries of Talona, acquire the power of blight touch, that inflicted [[Talona's Blight]] upon those it struck; the blight was a deadly disease that could not be halted with anything short of magic, and that turned those it slew into blightspawned monsters. Not long after, a blightlord gained the ability to control the blightspawned around them.

Talona would grant them more daily uses of her blight before granting the next ability: turning every glaive they wielded into black glaives, capable of delivering icy damage and the blight touch; with a little more progress, the glaive would cause deadly bleeding wounds. At the pinnacle of a blightlord's advancement, their infected blood turned them into winter-hearted monsters, plants in all but name.

==Equipment==
