        "mainbody": "hronologians were specialty priests in service to Labelas Enoreth, as the elven god in control of time, and they represented about 20% of the clergy in his church.\nMost chronologians were gold elves or silver elves, but any elves or half-elves were permitted to become chronologians. All members had above average intelligence and wisdom, could read and write in the Common language, and were of the same moral and ethical outlook as their patron. Once a member of this priesthood, one could not join another concurrently.\nChronologians were proficient in many of the same skills as were wizards, and they were particularly skilled at astrology and the knowledge of ancient elven history. They were typically trained in the use of club, dagger, knife, or quarterstaff. For ranged weapons, they favored slings and staff slings. When armored, they wore leather or elven chainmail.\nLabelas granted his chronologians the power to cast divine spells from the all, animal, astral, charm, divination, necromantic, numbers, plant, protection, sun, thought, and time spheres of influence, along with the minor spheres of healing and weather.\nChronologians were protected from the effects of time-related spells and supernatural powers that would cause them to age. The most powerful among them did not physically age at all.\nChronologians had an inherent ability to always know what time it was and could daily receive divine knowledge of any individual or objects age. They also were granted the power to withdraw from the time stream for a few minutes to ponder problems or even cast spells, while time continued to flow normally for those around them.\nAs chronologians advanced in their order, they eventually gained additional powers, including limited ability to select from among possible future outcomes to send a willing target into a rejuvenating restful sleep to haste or slow allies or foes and to age plants, objects, or creatures or otherwise affect their internal clocks. Very powerful chronologians were able to create time pools once a day and could divine legendary lore about any object that they touched. The most advanced in their order were able to duplicate the powers of time stop and temporal stasis spells."
