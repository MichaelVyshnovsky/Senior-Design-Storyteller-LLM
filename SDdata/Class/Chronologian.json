        "mainbody": "'''Chronologians''' were [[specialty priest]]s in service to [[Labelas Enoreth]], as the [[Elf|elven]] god in control of time, and they represented about 20% of the clergy in his church.",
        "Culture": "Most chronologians were [[gold elves]] or [[silver elves]], but any [[elves]] or [[half-elves]] were permitted to become chronologians. All members had above average intelligence and wisdom, could read and write in the [[Common]] language, and were of the [[chaotic good|same moral and ethical outlook as their patron]]. Once a member of this priesthood, one could not join another concurrently.",
        "Abilities": "Chronologians were proficient in many of the same skills as were [[wizard]]s, and they were particularly skilled at [[astrology]] and the knowledge of ancient elven history. They were typically trained in the use of [[club]], [[dagger]], [[knife]], or [[quarterstaff]]. For ranged weapons, they favored [[sling]]s and [[staff sling]]s. When armored, they wore [[leather armor|leather]] or [[elven chainmail]].\n\nLabelas granted his chronologians the power to cast [[divine spell]]s from the [[all sphere|all]], [[Animal sphere|animal]], [[Astral sphere|astral]], [[Charm sphere|charm]], [[Divination sphere|divination]], [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]], [[Numbers sphere|numbers]], [[Plant sphere|plant]], [[Protection sphere|protection]], [[Sun sphere|sun]], [[Thought sphere|thought]], and [[Time sphere|time]] [[sphere]]s of influence, along with the minor spheres of [[Healing sphere|healing]] and [[Weather sphere|weather]].\n\nChronologians were protected from the effects of time-related [[spell]]s and supernatural powers that would cause them to age. The most powerful among them did not physically age at all.\n\nChronologians had an inherent ability to always [[Know time|know what time it was]] and could daily [[Know age|receive divine knowledge of any individual or object's age]]. They also were granted the power to [[withdraw]] from the time stream for a few minutes to ponder problems or even cast spells, while time continued to flow normally for those around them.\n\nAs chronologians advanced in their order, they eventually gained additional powers, including limited ability to [[Choose future|select from among possible future outcomes]]; to [[Nap|send a willing target into a rejuvenating restful sleep]]; to [[haste]] or [[slow]] allies or foes; and to [[age plant]]s, [[Age object|object]]s, or [[Age creature|creatures]] or otherwise affect their [[Body clock|internal clocks]]. Very powerful chronologians were able to create [[time pool]]s once a day and could divine [[Legend lore|legendary lore]] about any object that they touched. The most advanced in their order were able to duplicate the powers of ''[[time stop]]'' and ''[[temporal stasis]]'' spells."
