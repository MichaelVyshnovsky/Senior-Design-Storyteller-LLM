        "mainbody": "Manannan Mac Lir was an interloper deity of oceans who originated from another plane of existence.There were no known worshipers of Manannan Mac Lir on the planet of Toril. However, as detailed in the \"Worshipers\" section, Manannan Mac Lir is mentioned in the Al-Qadim sourcebook Secrets of the Lamp, as being worshiped by marids in the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls. For this reason, Manannan Mac Lir is documented in this article.\nThe avatar form of mac Lir was that of a large human male with a red beard.\nHe held great respect for those who could master the seas, but showed no pity for those who drowned.\nWhen in a body of salt water, mac Lir was immune to the effects of nearly any magical item. The ocean god was also capable of calling upon any ocean creature to fight for him. \nWithin his divine realm he could either grant or deprive creatures of the ability to breathe water. He also had absolute control of any magical item or spell that granted the ability to breathe water, being capable of deactivating them at his whim. He was willing to grant water breathing to anyone who asked him nicely, though would take it away if he felt the ability was being abused.\nThis deity owned a set of armor made of metal and sea shells, with a +5 enchantment, which he typically donned when entering combat. In terms of weapons he owned a magical trident, which could extract the moisture from a foes body, and a deadly broadsword known as Retaliator. A blade that would almost certainly kill any fire giants it struck instantly. He also owned a sea chariot that his avatar rode upon, pulled by various sea creatures.\nthumb|220px|A map showing Tir fo Thuinn in relation to other divine realms.\nManannan Mac Lir lived within the Outlands, in the divine realm of Tir fo Thuinn. This domain was a large lake located near the Celtic pantheons main realm of Tir na Og, at the base of the Spire. The realm was full of stunning undersea vistas. Strewn with shells, aquamarine, and turquoise.\nHis petitioners lived their lives as if they were still above land, albeit with both obvious and subtle differences, such as herding fish in place of cattle and sheep. His petitioners were also callous to travelers that fell on hard times.\nthumb|220px|A map showing the depths of Tir fo Thuinn.\nManannan Mac Lir generally considered fire giants to be his enemies and would reserve the use of his blade Retaliator for fighting them.\nAfter being rivals for eons, mac Lir and Poseidon agreed to put their differences aside and began to improve their relations, though they were far from being close.\nthumb|273px|One of Manannan Mac Lirs holy symbols.\nThe priests of his faith could be either clerics or druids. They typically wielded maces or tridents as weapons. They wore a helmet and kilt for priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the animal, astral, combat, divination, elemental, guardian, healing, plant, summoning, and weather spheres. They particularly had access to the spells create or destroy water and water breathing.\nHis priests were required to base themselves in coastal regions or villages, but were permitted to travel inland on any business that could affect the seas. They were also encouraged to protect both the ocean and its creatures.\nSome of the marids of Zakhara paid homage to mac Lir, having a shrine to him at their Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.\n* Rumors had it that mac Lir kept strange monsters within dark, eerie grottos of Tir fo Thuinn for use as mounts. Some rumors additionally claimed that these monsters were his children. Most people assume these alleged mounts were merely just a rumor.\n* Rumors claimed that mac Lir and Poseidons eons long feud continued to simmer just below the surface of their improved relationship.\n* On some worlds it was believed that mac Lir had aided the god Deep Sashelas in banishing Panzuriel."
