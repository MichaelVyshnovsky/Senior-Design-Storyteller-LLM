        "mainbody": "'''Water Lion''' was an enigmatic [[lesser deity]] and a member of the ''[[asathalfinare]]'' pantheon—an alliance of [[good]]-aligned gods of aquatic races.",
        "Description": "Water Lion's avatar took the form of a giant [[sea lion]] made of water, held in shape by a flexible membrane.",
        "Personality": "Water Lion was usually happy and playful but could fall into a mood of dark melancholy at times. When in a foul mood, he became prickly and standoffish, even to the point of violently attacking anyone that approached him. [[Dolphin]]s, [[sea elves]], and [[paladin]]s could sometimes gain an audience with him during these times, but they had to stand silently until he granted them his attention.",
        "Abilities": "Water Lion could cast spells from any of the [[druid]]ic [[:Category:Spheres of influence|spheres]] and a few others. He had some proficiency with [[arcane magic]] related to the [[:Category:Elemental water spells (2e)|elemental water]], [[abjuration]], and [[enchantment/charm]] schools. He was somewhat susceptible to fire but was immune to water-based spells. He could not be fooled by [[illusion/phantasm]] spells or subverted by mind-affecting spells. His roar—which he often did just because it brought him joy—could temporarily deafen and [[Confusion|confuse]] creatures nearby. If they were spellcasters, this sometimes caused them to forget prepared spells.",
        "Divine Realm": "Water Lion had no known home. He wandered the [[planes]], and his avatar was constantly roaming the [[Prime Material plane]].",
        "Activities": "His goals and intentions were a mystery, so many myths sprang up to fill the void. Some said he wandered to find a child that he lost or perhaps a companion god, such as [[Stillsong]], to whom he felt loyalty.",
        "Relationships": "Water Lion was typically aloof, ignoring most attempts to communicate. However, he especially loved songs and knew if any [[bard]]s were within {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} of his person. He would often reward a personal performance with a [[pearl]] or some other trinket from the sea. He was on good terms with [[Deep Sashelas]] and the other ''asathalfinare'', [[Istishia]], and [[Nobanion]]. He sometimes received help from [[Ben-hadar]], the Prince of Good Water Creatures.{{Cite dragon/353/Princes of Elemental Good|45}}\n\nWater Lion had an extreme dislike for sharks and was known to attack them on sight."
