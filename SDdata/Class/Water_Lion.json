        "mainbody": "Water Lion was an enigmatic lesser deity and a member of the asathalfinare pantheon—an alliance of good-aligned gods of aquatic races.\nWater Lions avatar took the form of a giant sea lion made of water, held in shape by a flexible membrane.\nWater Lion was usually happy and playful but could fall into a mood of dark melancholy at times. When in a foul mood, he became prickly and standoffish, even to the point of violently attacking anyone that approached him. Dolphins, sea elves, and paladins could sometimes gain an audience with him during these times, but they had to stand silently until he granted them his attention.\nWater Lion could cast spells from any of the druidic spheres and a few others. He had some proficiency with arcane magic related to the elemental water, abjuration, and enchantment/charm schools. He was somewhat susceptible to fire but was immune to water-based spells. He could not be fooled by illusion/phantasm spells or subverted by mind-affecting spells. His roar—which he often did just because it brought him joy—could temporarily deafen and confuse creatures nearby. If they were spellcasters, this sometimes caused them to forget prepared spells.\nWater Lion had no known home. He wandered the planes, and his avatar was constantly roaming the Prime Material plane.\nHis goals and intentions were a mystery, so many myths sprang up to fill the void. Some said he wandered to find a child that he lost or perhaps a companion god, such as Stillsong, to whom he felt loyalty.\nWater Lion was typically aloof, ignoring most attempts to communicate. However, he especially loved songs and knew if any bards were within  of his person. He would often reward a personal performance with a pearl or some other trinket from the sea. He was on good terms with Deep Sashelas and the other asathalfinare, Istishia, and Nobanion. He sometimes received help from Ben-hadar, the Prince of Good Water Creatures.\nWater Lion had an extreme dislike for sharks and was known to attack them on sight."
