'''Nathair Sgiathach''' ({{Pronounce|neigh|er|_|skey|ak|refs={{Cite dragon/269/Animal Henchmen|30}} and a member of Queen [[Titania]]'s [[Seelie Court]], although he did not participate much. The translation of his name was "winged serpent".The in-universe language for this translation is not given in the source; however, in the real world, it is [[wikipedia:Irish language|Irish]]. In the Forgotten Realms, this would most likely place it in one of the [[Waelan]] languages, such as [[Druidic language|Druidic]].

==Description==
Nathair Sgiathach was a tiny and thin [[dragon]] with gossamer butterfly-like wings and a prehensile tail. He was only about {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} long. He was always seen with an utterly enormous smile.

==Personality==
Nathair Sgiathach was quite unlike any of the other [[Draconic pantheon|draconic deities]]. He adored the [[fey|faerie folk]]. He was playful, a quality usually enjoyed by the fey, but he was so frivolous and flippant about even serious matters that even the other members of the Seelie Court could not tolerate all of his shenanigans and behaviors. He acted pretentious when meeting new beings—such as by exaggerating the pronunciation of his name—but only as a game, and was more of a jester than an advisor.

Nathair would willingly defend faeries in need. Typically, he would attempt to drive off or humiliate enemies rather than kill them. He loved juvenile practical jokes. A favorite gag was using magical illusions to cause the buttocks of [[human]]s to radiate red light

Nathair Sgiathach loved eating apple pie, but he was quite picky about them, preferring especially apple pies made with [[honey]] and [[wikipedia:Sultana (grape)|white raisins]].

==Powers==
Nathair's methods of combat were seen as silly by most, but his powers were actually rather substantial. The god of faerie and pseudodragons could breathe a [[euphoria gas]] that incapacitated enemies by making them deliriously blissful, causing them to do such things in the middle of battle as wandering about aimlessly picking pretty flowers while their companions fought on. He also enjoyed using his powerful [[Polymorph any object|polymorphing magic]] to transform enemies' weapons into stuffed animal toys or other ridiculous items.

Nathair Sgiathach could always remain [[greater invisibility|invisible]] if he desired, even while casting spells or attacking. He was also immune to all [[enchantment]]s and [[charm]]s,  [[illusion]]s, petrification, paralyzation, and elemental damage. He could only be harmed by powerful magic weapons and spells.

Nathair Sgiathach also employed [[divine magic]] [[spell]]s and focused on those from the [[Animal sphere|animal]], [[Chaos sphere|chaos]], [[Charm sphere|charm]], [[Elemental sphere|elemental]], [[Plant sphere|plant]], and [[weather sphere]]s.

==Divine Realm==
Nathair shared the [[divine realm]] of the other members of the Seelie Court, which had no permanent location but instead wandered from plane to plane, from the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] to [[Arborea]] to [[Ysgard]].

==Activities==
Nathair Sgiathach often sent [[avatar]]s to the [[Material Plane]], primarily to play pranks on visitors to sylvan areas. He visited the island of [[Evermeet]] often.

==Relationships==
Nathair Sgiathach was counted among the children of [[Io]], overgod of dragons, but he had nothing in common with the rest of his kind.

Being too silly even for Titania and [[Oberon]] to handle, Nathair was only allowed in the Outer Circle of the Seelie Court, but they recognized that he was a powerful ally.

The little dragon god was good friend with the official Court Jester, [[Sqeulaiche]] of the [[leprechaun]]s.

==Worshipers==
Nathair's worshipers included not only [[chaotic good]]-leaning pseudodragons and faerie dragons, His [[holy symbol]] was a big smile.

He was not directly worshiped in most places in the Realms; however, the more mischievous of the [[elves]] of [[Faerûn]] often offered prayers to him along with their worship of the [[Seldarine]], as they also did to the other deities of the fey people. The faerie dragons of Evermeet each worshiped Nathair in his or her own way.

==History==
After the [[Second Sundering]], it was claimed that Nathair Sgiathach was not a real [[deity]], and that his extraordinary powers were a result of his highly developed ''[[dragonsight]]''.
