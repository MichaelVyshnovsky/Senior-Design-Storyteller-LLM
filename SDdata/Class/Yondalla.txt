Yondalla () was the creator of the halfling race and matriarch of not only the halfling pantheon, but the whole race itself. With her charming personality and friendly demeanor she was an example to all halflings who almost all shared her curiosity, loyalty and sense of mischief.
Yondalla had close bonds with Garl Glittergold, Corellon Larethian and Moradin. With the passion with which she loved and admired her fellow halfling deities, sometimes known as Yondallas Children, she scorned certain evil deities, such as Bane, Cyric, Talona, Talos, and the Deities of Fury.
