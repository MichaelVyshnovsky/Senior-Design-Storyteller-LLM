'''Yondalla''' ({{Pronounce|yon|DAH|lah|refs=}}) was the creator of the [[halfling]] race and matriarch of not only the [[halfling pantheon]], but the whole race itself. With her charming personality and friendly demeanor she was an example to all halflings; who almost all shared her curiosity, loyalty and sense of mischief.

==Relationships==
Yondalla had close bonds with [[Garl Glittergold]], [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Moradin]]. With the passion with which she loved and admired her fellow halfling deities, sometimes known as 'Yondalla's Children', she scorned certain evil deities, such as [[Bane]], [[Cyric]], [[Talona]], [[Talos]], and the [[Deities of Fury]].

Despite her widespread worship among halflings and her central role in their society; her temples were unusually rare, those that did exist were designed to look like a well-hidden halfling burrow-home and were filled with weapons and food so that the communities that surrounded them could hold out against possible invaders. Her clergy were afforded a lot of respect by the followers of other gods for their defensive capabilities in spite of their small stature.

Powerful [[cleric]]s of Yondalla were granted the ability to cast ''[[Curse of Yondalla]]'', a spell reserved to be used against those who committed foul crimes against halflings.
