They helped the hunters of their village and protected their community from dangerous roaming wild animals.\nA fetishist was a well-respected member of their Azuposi community, though they lacked the status of true priests.\nThey were usually quite skilled with training, handling, and mimicking animals.\nThey wielded clubs, slings, daggers, or short bows."
