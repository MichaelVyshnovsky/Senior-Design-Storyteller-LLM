The '''College of Lore''' was a [[bardic college]] that focused on the accumulation of knowledge from any and all sources across the Realms.

==Activities==
These bards drew upon lore they uncovered far and wide, from esoteric scholarly works to local folk stories from rural communities. They used their expansive knowledge to create masterful works that fascinated and delighted their audiences. College of Lore bards were just as capable of influencing nobles attending a royal court as they were captivating audiences at local festival or rowdy pub.

When not performing in front of an audience, these bards met together in places of learning to share the lore they had accumulated during their travels and studies.

==Culture==
College of Lore bards held their allegiance to the ideal of sharing truth, as they saw it, and upholding the virtue of creative beauty.

==Abilities==
These bards were so adept with the spoken word, they could cut down others with a [[cutting words|mere few words]]. The targets of their quips and gibes were often left befuddled and blundering in their actions.

Due to their extensive studies, students of the College of Lore often grew more skillful than other bards and accumulated knowledge regarding more [[arcane spell]]s.

Some bards became so masterful of their craft, they could even inspire themselves to achieve new heights. They appeared as experts of the bardic arts, entirely without peer to their level of talent.

==History==
Many of the bards that studied at [[New Olamn]] in [[Waterdeep]], [[Fochlucan]] in [[Silverymoon]], and the [[College of the Herald]], were students of the College of Lore.
