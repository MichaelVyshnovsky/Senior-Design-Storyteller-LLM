        "mainbody": "Nightbringers were specialty priests of the Church of Shar who were dedicated to bringing darkness to all and opposing Selûne and her faithful.\nThey were true children of Shar who enjoyed invoking paranoia and terror in others by saying phrases like \"What could the darkness be concealing?\"\nNightbringers were skilled in moving silently and concealing themselves in shadows. When facing followers of Selûne in combat they were inspired by Shar and found it easy to strike and harm their opponents. They had a number of spell-like abilities including darkness and continual darkness that could be used several times per day. They could call upon Shars power once during a week of the full moon, imparting the benefits of a potion of heroism upon them.\nThey were affected negatively in combat when fighting during day or under the light of a full moon. They were unable to use spells from the sun and weather spheres, and could only use the reverse forms of any spells from the light sphere.\nA nightbringer typically wore a tunic and leggings of purple cloth trimmed with black, and a large hooded cloak of the same coloration. Shars holy symbol adorned the front of their tunic. The weapons they carried were easily concealed. Nightbringers could wear any armor they desired, but most preferred armor that suited stealth and flexibility."
