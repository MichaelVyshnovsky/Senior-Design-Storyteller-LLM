        "Abilities": "These individuals were always [[human]]s, [[ophidian]]s, [[spirit naga]]s, [[yuan-ti]] (with the exception of [[histachii]]), or any other reptilian race. Regardless of their race, all serphidians' eyes became slitted like a [[snake]] as soon as they joined the priesthood.\n\nSerphidians were immune to every type of reptilian venom. They also gained immunity to all poisons as they progressed through the ranks. Serphidians also enjoyed a variety of magical abilities including ''[[speak with animals|speak with reptiles]], [[sleep]], [[sticks to snakes]], [[snake skin]], [[animal summoning II]],'' and ''[[vipergout]]''. Particularly powerful serphidians could ''[[shapechange]]'' into a [[Constrictor snake|giant constrictor snake]], [[boalisk]], or [[amphisbaena]].",
        "Possessions": "Serphidians typically wore [[scale mail]]. They were not restricted in the type of weapons they could wield."
