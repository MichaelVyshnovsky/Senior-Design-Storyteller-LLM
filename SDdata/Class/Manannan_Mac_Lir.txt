'''Manannan Mac Lir''' was an interloper [[deity]] of oceans who originated from another [[earth|plane of existence]].<ref group="note" name="reason">There were no known worshipers of Manannan Mac Lir on the planet of Toril. However, as detailed in the "Worshipers" section, Manannan Mac Lir is mentioned in the [[Al-Qadim]] sourcebook ''[[Secrets of the Lamp]]'', as being worshiped by [[marid]]s in the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls. For this reason, Manannan Mac Lir is documented in this article.

==Description==
The [[avatar]] form of mac Lir was that of a large [[human]] male with a red beard.

==Personality==
He held great respect for those who could master the seas, but showed no pity for those who drowned.

==Abilities==
When in a body of salt water, mac Lir was immune to the effects of nearly any [[magical item]]. The ocean god was also capable of calling upon any ocean creature to fight for him. 

Within his [[divine realm]] he could either grant or deprive creatures of the ability to breathe water. He also had absolute control of any magical item or [[spell]] that granted the ability to breathe water, being capable of deactivating them at his whim. He was willing to grant water breathing to anyone who asked him nicely, though would take it away if he felt the ability was being abused.

==Possessions==
This deity owned a set of [[armor]] made of metal and sea shells, with a ''[[item enchantment|+5 enchantment]]'', which he typically donned when entering combat. In terms of weapons he owned a magical [[trident]], which could extract the moisture from a foe's body, and a deadly [[broadsword]] known as ''Retaliator''. A blade that would almost certainly kill any [[fire giant]]s it struck instantly. He also owned a [[chariot|sea chariot]] that his avatar rode upon, pulled by various sea creatures.

==Realm==
[[File:Tir fo Thuinn Map.png|thumb|220px|''A map showing Tir fo Thuinn in relation to other divine realms.'']]
Manannan Mac Lir lived within the [[Outlands]], in the [[divine realm]] of '''Tir fo Thuinn'''. This domain was a large lake located near the [[Celtic pantheon]]'s main realm of [[Tir na Og]], at the base of the [[Spire]].<ref> The realm was full of stunning undersea vistas. Strewn with shells, [[aquamarine]], and [[turquoise]].

His [[petitioner]]s lived their lives as if they were still above land, albeit with both obvious and subtle differences, such as herding [[fish]] in place of [[cattle]] and [[sheep]]. His petitioners were also callous to travelers that fell on hard times.

==Relationships==
Manannan Mac Lir generally considered fire giants to be his enemies and would reserve the use of his blade ''Retaliator'' for fighting them.

After being rivals for eons, mac Lir and [[Poseidon]] agreed to put their differences aside and began to improve their relations, though they were far from being close.

==Worshipers==
[[File:MacLir Symbol.png|thumb|273px|''One of Manannan Mac Lir's holy symbols.'']]
The priests of his faith could be either [[cleric]]s or [[druid]]s. They typically wielded [[mace]]s or [[trident]]s as weapons. They wore a [[helmet]] and kilt for priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the [[animal sphere|animal]], [[astral sphere|astral]], [[combat sphere|combat]], [[divination sphere|divination]], [[elemental sphere|elemental]], [[guardian sphere|guardian]], [[healing sphere|healing]], [[plant sphere|plant]], [[summoning sphere|summoning]], and [[weather sphere|weather]] [[sphere]]s. They particularly had access to the spells ''[[create or destroy water]]'' and ''[[water breathing]]''.

His priests were required to base themselves in coastal regions or villages, but were permitted to travel inland on any business that could affect the seas. They were also encouraged to protect both the ocean and its creatures.

Some of the [[marid]]s of [[Zakhara]] paid homage to mac Lir, having a shrine to him at their [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].

==Rumors & Legends==
* Rumors had it that mac Lir kept strange monsters within dark, eerie grottos of Tir fo Thuinn for use as [[mount]]s. Some rumors additionally claimed that these monsters were his children. Most people assume these alleged mounts were merely just a rumor.
* Rumors claimed that mac Lir and Poseidon's eons long feud continued to simmer just below the surface of their improved relationship.
* On some worlds it was believed that mac Lir had aided the god [[Deep Sashelas]] in banishing [[Panzuriel]].
