        "mainbody": "Yondalla () was the creator of the halfling race and matriarch of not only the halfling pantheon, but the whole race itself. With her charming personality and friendly demeanor she was an example to all halflings who almost all shared her curiosity, loyalty and sense of mischief.\nYondalla had close bonds with Garl Glittergold, Corellon Larethian and Moradin. With the passion with which she loved and admired her fellow halfling deities, sometimes known as Yondallas Children, she scorned certain evil deities, such as Bane, Cyric, Talona, Talos, and the Deities of Fury.\n250px|left|thumb|The holy symbol of Yondalla\nDespite her widespread worship among halflings and her central role in their society her temples were unusually rare, those that did exist were designed to look like a well-hidden halfling burrow-home and were filled with weapons and food so that the communities that surrounded them could hold out against possible invaders. Her clergy were afforded a lot of respect by the followers of other gods for their defensive capabilities in spite of their small stature.\nPowerful clerics of Yondalla were granted the ability to cast Curse of Yondalla, a spell reserved to be used against those who committed foul crimes against halflings.\ncenter|381x381px|A statue of Yondalla watched over a halfling funeral|thumb"
