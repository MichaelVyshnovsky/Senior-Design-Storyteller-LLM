He conveyed displeasure through the appearance of shattered shields, upside-down helms, and fleeting footprints that quickly faded if followed.",

        },
        "Personality": "By those of a [[chaotic]] bent, Gorm was often written off as the classic dour dwarf, with even most dwarves themselves perceiving the Sentinel as surly and humorless. He had little patience for those he distrusted, little interest or tolerance for distracting foolishness, little use for sentimentality that could disrupt the dispassionate performance of his duty, and generally little to say. Ever-consumed by his demanding role as the dwarves' defender, he was on constant alert for threats to the Stout folk to thwart, even coming to the defense of the [[duergar]] if their own evil was dwarfed by that of the enemy force.",
        "Powers": {
            "Manifestation": "Gorm couldn't manifest an avatar in the same area twice in a 24 hour period, but battles lasting more than one day could see him manifest multiple times. He could manifest himself by granting a dwarf a ''[[protection from good]] [[protection from evil|and evil]]'' aura, as well as immunity to a certain kind of spell or attack (such as fire). He could also enchant a weapon, making it more powerful until the end of the current battle or the end of the next."
        },
        "Possessions": "Gorm's personal weapon was ''[[Axegard]]'', his heavily enchanted, two-handed [[battleaxe]] that gave its wielder the power of a ''[[robe of eyes]]''.\n\nThe runes inscribed on Gorm's armor acted as a ''[[ring of spell turning]]'', allowing him to, by silent act of will, reflect the effects of any spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items back at whoever sent them. He could only activate this effect once every ten minutes, but the power worked instantaneously, regardless of any physical restraints or strikes used against him, and could reflect any number of effects used simultaneously.",
        "Realm": "Gorm's nominal home was Watchkeep, a tower he and his avatars only returned to when they needed access to his amassed armory or his magical [[Seat of Healing]], which could restore all injury done to him or anyone else he allowed to sit on it and could regenerate extensive physical damage in somewhere under an hour.\n\nWatchkeep was said to be in [[Bytopia]], in the blizzard-whipped mountains of [[Shurrock]], and at others times to be built on a distant foothill in Dwarfhome. In Dwarfhome, Gorm was said to keep constant watch over all the rest of the plane from the top of the tower, immediately knowing if a portal opened. Many dwarven defenders hoped for the privileges to stand guard there after death, believing that those who died fighting superior forces in the line of duty would be granted the right.",
        "Activities": "Gorm had a preference for direct action, and so conserved his power for personal combat, seldom manifesting in other ways except to bestow individual dwarfs with temporary fighting powers. However, even though Gorm could have two avatars acting simultaneously, there were always so many battles required his attention that he could rarely send them to a single location for more than around ten minutes. As such, Gorm manifested on the [[Prime Material Plane]] far more often than his companions in the [[Morndinsamman]], always shifting from place to place to help protect dwarven realms from armed invasion or dangerous monsters.\n\nOnly when dwarves were already in an engagement and in need of his aid did Gorm appear, holding nothing back in a frenzied attempt to do as much harm to the enemy as possible before vanishing to deal with some other conflict. Those who saw him fight to defend dwarven communities relayed his stunning battle prowess and evident millennia of diligent training, but also commented that his combat maneuvers showed an increasing desperation, as if he believed each battle might be his last.\n\nWhen forced to leave a battle while the dwarves still faced grave danger, Gorm would later manifest as a glowing hand and proceed to assist the dwarves in battle, the hand doing things such as breaking [[rope]]s, pushing away siege ladders and punching opponents. He also took preemptive measures like keeping vigils on battlefronts and creating deadfalls in passages neighboring enclaves. On occasion, he roused dwarves from sleep or alerted them of issues in disembodied gauntlet form.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:HighOnesTriumph.png|left|thumb|300px|Gorm (far left), [[Clangeddin]], [[Marthammor]], and [[Haela Brightaxe]] after besting their foes.]]\nGorm was often considered one of the younger members of the Morndinsamman, though older than those such as [[Haela Brightaxe]]. He had always been a member in good standing and had excellent relations with the non[[chaotic]] and non[[evil]] dwarven deities, [[Berronar Truesilver]] worked closely with Gorm, Clangeddin, and Moradin to ensure the safety of dwarven settlements.\n\nGorm had established positive relations with gods of other pantheons that held similar worldviews, including [[Helm]] of the [[FaerÃ»nian pantheon]], [[Arvoreen]] of the [[halfling]]s, and [[Gaerdal Ironhand]] of the [[gnome]]s. Also among his allies were [[Cyrrollalee]], also of the [[halfling pantheon]], and [[Garl Glittergold]], leader of the [[gnome pantheon]].\n\nConversely, Gorm was suspicious of entities like [[Mask]], [[Brandobaris]], and [[Baervan Wildwanderer]]. He remained eternally vigilant of [[Abbathor]], though for all the Trove Lord's suspected treachery, Gorm was never able to prove it. He also counted among his foes the duergar gods [[Laduguer]] and [[Deep Duerra]], the hateful gnome god [[Urdlen]], and the various deities of traditionally dwarvish foes, including [[orcs]], [[goblin]]s, [[kobold]]s, and evil [[giant]]s. Despite his regular contests with such beings, the Sentinel's greatest hatred was reserved for the orcish deity [[Shargaas]], for the Night Lord was the only being to have ever successfully stolen something Gorm was actively guarding.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Gorm's devoted were sworn to protect the Stout Folk from the hostile forces beyond their holds, and were never to waver in their duty to these sacred charges.\n\nGuardian-priests had to be ever-alert and unceasingly vigilant so as to never be surprised. They also had to inform other dwarven warriors about the value of these traits, organizing the community's defense in the steady, reliable way Gorm had taught.",
            "Rituals": "[[File:Gorm_symbol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gorm's symbol]]\nBarakor prayed for spells in the morning, usually followed by a tour of their community to ensure that no incidents happened at night.\n\nGorm's priests celebrated each festival in the [[Calendar of Harptos]] as a sacred event, and on such holy days they gathered to perform (as outsiders saw them) tedious procedures, containing formal salutes, didactic, chanted prayers, and a ritual involving the rhythmic grounding of weapons. Other rituals involved silent vigils, muttered prayers and answering Gorm's visions. Offering were made to Gorm in the form of used weapons to guard, even if broken, anointed with tears, sweat, and drops of blood form the worshiper.\n\nAt the height of the salute, if performed at the chancel of one of his temples, Gorm's power might open the door kept behind the altar and through it bestow [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, weapons, armor, maps,Â or instructive phantom images to help his followers fulfill their duties. A worshiper wearing, carrying or using a gift of the god typically had a great boost in morale."
        },
        "History": "By the late 14th century [[DR]], Gorm Gulthyn was dying. Over the centuries, as he kept using his essence to create avatars to defend dwarven kingdoms, his very existence had somehow become tied to their fates. Something inside him died with each clanhold to fall, the fire in his mask's eyeholes fading out by nearly imperceptible increments with each loss. With each new manifestation, the Golden Guardian became ironically more reckless in his defense, perhaps planning to end his degenerative condition at the hands of a foe. He had confided his condition only with his closest friends, and all hoped for the [[Thunder Blessing]] and the resurgence of ancient dwarven bloodlines to restore his strength.\n\nGorm, along with Haela Brightaxe, died in the Morndinsamman's battle with the duergar deities Laduguer and Deep Duerra in [[1383 DR]], his divinity finally spent. However, it was possible that he still had influence outside of [[Realmspace]]. After the [[Second Sundering]], he was once again present and revered by the dwarves, but the exact circumstances of his return were unknown."
