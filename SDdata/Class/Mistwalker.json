        "mainbody": "Mistwalkers were specialty priests of the Church of Leira who were masters of deception.\nMistwalkers used lies and deception in their everyday lives. They carried this to the extreme by being deceptive about whether or not Leira was even still alive following the Time of Troubles.\nMistwalkers were soft-spoken individuals who moved about like shadows.\nMost mistwalkers were skilled actors which helped them spin truly convincing lies. They found it easier to see through illusions and resist the magic of a ring of truth when compared with normal people. They gained several powers as they advanced that could be used on a daily basis including phantasmal force, improved phantasmal force, and spectral force.\nSunlight was a mistwalkers enemy, making it slightly more difficult for them to resist the effects of spells. They could not turn undead like other priests.\nMistwalkers wore soft clothing that was either gray or flat black. They also wore a large hooded cloak of a different color and usually had their hoods drawn to hide their features. The heaviest armor they could wear was leather armor. For weaponry they usually preferred either a short sword, dagger, or garrote. They never wielded two-handed weapons. Their holy symbol served as an amulet of proof against detection and location."
