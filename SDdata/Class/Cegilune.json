        "Description": "Cegilune appeared as a filthy, {{SIAdj|10|ft|adj=tall|long=yes}} hag with mottled, yellow-brown skin, iron-hard claws and a balding scalp from which patches of lank hair flaked off. However, her power to [[disguise self|disguise herself]] meant she could take on a myriad of forms, her usual choice being that of a young [[human]] or [[elf|elven]] female, a homely crone, or, very rarely, a scruffy [[goblinoid]]. She could be recognized when in disguise by the small [[iron pot]] she always carried with her.",
        "Personality": "Cegilune was a truly wretched being of malevolent will, deep hatred and sadistic desire. The suspicious and avaricious hag mistress was filled with resentment and planned to enact bitter revenge against a world that left her behind ages ago.",
        "Powers": "Cegilune's [[avatar]]s had some of the dangerous qualities of ordinary hags; they had enough power behind their teeth and talons to rend flesh and could ''change self'' at will. They were immune to [[illusion]]s, [[enchantment]]s, [[poison]]s, and [[death magic]], couldn't be harmed without greatly enchanted magical weapons and were barely harmed by [[acid]]- or [[cold]]-based attacks, although oddly they were vulnerable to [[petrification]]. They could create ''[[forcecage]]s'' four times each day, kill instantly with their gaze twice a day, and unleash a [[banshee]]-like wail once every seven days.\n\nAs one might expect from a lunar goddess, Cegilune's power waxed and waned with the phases of the moon of the world she was on. In the case where a [[world]] had multiple moons, her power was tied to the one specifically associated with evil, and failing that the one with the shortest lunar cycle. At the start of the lunar cycle—namely the days before, during, and after a new moon—she was weaker, unable to use her death gaze, and had diminished magical resistance. At the end of the cycle, however—the days before, during, and after a full moon—both her spells and magical resistance were super-charged and on the specific night of the full moon itself she could cast a [[insanity|lunacy]]-inducing ''[[moonbeam]]'' spell.",
        "Possessions": "Cegilune had her own great [[iron]] [[cauldron]] within her lair that she often put souls and stolen magical treasures in to bring forth horrible evils. Her avatars carried their own small pots, each capable of producing four different magical effects once per day. Each could create 9–16 poisonous [[snake]]s, project a magical [[screen]], throw up a web {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, and produce a vial of incredibly dangerous, strength-sapping poison that the avatar could coat her claws in, although it took a few minutes to kick in and wore off the talons after only a few claw swipes.\n\nHer avatars also had small, beaded bags containing up to twenty [[hag eye]]s, the shriveled eyes of the hag's former victims magically treated to let her see through them at will from up to {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} away. Like typical hag eyes, creating them was dangerous since their destruction would damage their creator, so they were carefully concealed around the perimeter of their activities. Similarly, Cegilune had a number of [[soul gem]]s buried in secret places, each enchanted with powerful ''[[chain contingency]]'' spells, rendering her virtually indestructible under ordinary circumstances.",
        "Divine Realm": "Cegilune's realm was in the Gray Wastes of [[Hades]], a dreary domain of endless misery. Ironically, the Wastes were without a moon or any other celestial bodies: it was simply a featureless gray expanse, a land of never-ending twilight offering neither the closure of dusk or the new hope of dawn. The wastes the embittered hag goddess called home drained the emotions and vibrancy from all that entered. The only known protection against the apathy being to hide and internalize one's emotions deep within the mind. Cegilune's lair was located in Pluton, the lowest layer of the Wastes, in a desolate pit known as Hag's End, halfway up a vast mountain of black, dead rock. From inside her filthy, bone-strewn cave crypt Cegilune stirred her vile brews under a small, glowing, hovering replica of the full moon.",
        "Activities": "In order to bring about her day of reckoning, Cegilune had to conserve and foster what was left of her reduced power. Her primary method of doing so was to collect soul [[larva]]e, a basic unit of power and currency in the [[lower planes]], which she used for a variety of wicked purposes. She made use of their profane power to empower her hag servitors, expended them in dark rituals to create abominations to infest the [[Material Plane]] and traded them with [[lich]]es and [[tanar'ri]]. The latter was because she required magical aid in order to sustain herself, as much as she resented having to do so.\n\nDespite sending her [[night hag]]s to collect larvae, Cegilune didn't trust her psychopathic underlings and enjoyed watching creatures die, so she frequently sent avatars to the [[Material Plane]] to personally capture evil souls for transformation into larvae. Cegilune also went to the Material Plane to visit a small number of stone circles and standing stones in order to conduct enigmatic magical rituals. She kept her activities at these sacred sites incredibly secret, placing hag's eyes around the area and having somewhere between one to four night hags prowling the surroundings.\n\nThe rituals typically took place during the night of the full moon and were sometimes preceded by hunts where the avatar captured and rendered helpless a suitable sacrifice, such as a [[ranger]], [[druid]], [[fey]] creature, or [[swanmay]]. Swanmays were her favorite food, although a male [[human]] of formidable fighting prowess that she captured herself was also a delightful meal. She sometimes had a feast of flesh with a hag coven she was visiting to extract treasure or information from.",
        "Relationships": "Among the sylvan pantheon and sylvan beings in general, Cegilune was reviled, seen as a fearsome predator of faerie creatures that lurked in the darkness.\n\nThough the great Lich-Lord [[Mellifleur]] once tried to take control of the larva trade from the night hags with an army of [[undead]] [[wizard]]s,{{Cite dragon annual/1997/Pox of the Planes|104,108}} Cegilune's contingencies prevented even him from daring to attack her.\n\nCegilune had no real allies, only dealings with liches, demons, and some of the evil gods of [[giant]]kind. She also had a herald in the form of a gigantic larva she called Ambrosial, a mindless, gargantuan maggot with a fat [[humanoid]] face buried under rolls of corpulence that she bred only for the purpose of expressing her wrath.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Rituals": "Cegilune's places of worship were small, gruesome shrines kept by her devotees next to cauldrons and eating areas. Each night, her worshipers praised her virtues at length while cursing her enemies, escalating in profanity until the night of the full moon closest to the [[winter solstice]], whereupon they would each perform sacrifices in an attempt to devote the greatest torturous agony to her name. She had [[cleric]]s, who typically contacted night hags when using ''[[planar ally]]'' spells.\n\nHag covens with a worshiper of Cegilune as a member could also create a Brew of Cegilune's Blessing. By using a bloodstained idol of Cegilune mixed with bits of each coven mate's flesh, a noxious potion could be created that transformed the drinker into a [[fiendish creature|fiend]] for a week, albeit at the cost of a permanent loss of vitality afterwards.{{cite web\n| url            = https://paizo.com/products/btpy7zel\n| title          = Powers of the Covey: Hag Brews\n| accessdate     = 2020-10-20\n| author         = [[F.

        },
        "Rumors and Legends": {
            "Moonrise": "Given that hags were narcissistic with a penchant for deception, any claims regarding their history were likely self-aggrandizing interpretations at best, or just blatant lies. Still, a myth held for ages by [[ogre]]s and [[hill giant]]s—which, given Grolantor's supposed dalliance with Cegilune, lends it some credibility — offers some hints regarding the true nature of Cegilune and the hags.\n\nWhen the world was dark and young, the fearful races prayed for protection from things that haunted the night. In response the moon came into being, and with it, a queen to rule its light: Cegilune. Worship of the silver-haired beauty, said to be as fickle as the moon itself, quickly spread across the world, and the moon goddess received much fear and love from her worshipers.\n\nCegilune adopted as her daughters those followers who unwaveringly courted her favor, the most pious and pleasing priestesses whose beauty reminded Cegilune of her own. To them, Cegilune gifted powers to further her glory. She granted her prophets the power to walk on water; her evangelists, called \"songs\", were granted beautiful voices to compel others to worship; and her protectors were given the strength to protect other followers from attack.",
            "Moonset": "However, the indulgent Cegilune made the mistake of growing indolent, basking in worship while rarely expending the effort to assist her followers. Only when her supposed eternal beauty was marred by her first blemish did she realize her mistake, as - apart from her devout daughters - all her former worshipers had abandoned her. The deities of distant lands were able to appeal to those embittered by the moon goddess's vanity and neglect, as they took pride in their divine patrons and the power that came with their new allegiances.\n\nThe moon goddess's good sense was eclipsed by a thirst for blood and vengeance when faced with abandonment and mockery, so she sent her remaining daughters, now aged, and weakened by the waning of her worship, to enact a crusade. They slaughtered hundreds of her former worshipers, but this too was an incredible oversight on Cegilune's part. She was in no position to conduct a war with her and her daughters outnumbered by new deities and their devotees, and she was lacking a source of new divine power. Thus, her supposed holy war was very brief (yet no less horrible).\n\nCegilune's tantrum only served to cement the world's contempt towards her, as well as exhaust her stored divinity, devastating her beauty and leaving her a weakened crone. She retreated to the darkest, loneliest pit in existence, and her remaining daughters fled to the darker reaches of the world. Cegilune's divine blessings were infused with her bitterness and hatred, turning the prophets, songs, and protectors of Cegilune into the first [[sea hag|sea]], [[green hag|green]], and annis hags. Thereafter did Cegilune begin to brew her wicked schemes, planning revenge for the indignation she suffered at the hands of countless mortals and the usurper deities that took her place as the goddess of the night."
