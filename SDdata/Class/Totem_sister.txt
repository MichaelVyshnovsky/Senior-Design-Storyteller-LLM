Totem sisters were specialty priests devoted to Angharradh, the Union of the Three.
All totem sisters were female moon elves.
Totem sisters possessed many of the skills and powers of common druids.
They were able to use a rare form of magic called totemic magic that was similar to rune magic.
These individuals wielded a variety of weaponry but all were skilled in the use of the spear and long bow. The types of armor they were permitted to wear were limited to hide armor, leather armor, padded armor, studded leather, or chainmail. Some totem sisters also carried a shield.
