        "mainbody": "There were numerous shrines dedicated to Umberlee, predominantly located in port cities of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and in the [[Nelanther Isles]]. Travelers by sea were sure to pay their tribute to the Bitch Queen, as the preaching of her [[cleric]]s were built upon the terrible fate that would befall any who did not bring a sacrifice to Umberlee. Clerics were available at these temples, who, for a price, would travel with sailors to ensure no harm was inflicted.\n\nApart from the region around the Sea of Fallen Stars and at Nelanther Isles, Umberlee had places of worship at many ports. Among these were a temple in [[Urmlaspyr]], [[Sembia]], [[Murann]], a small shrine in the city of [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]], an opulent shrine in [[Athkatla]], a shrine of Umberlee could be found in the palace [[Dangwaru]] on the [[Snout of Omgar]], and another small shrine in [[Hillsfar]] on the Moonsea. Some of the noteworthy temples:\n\n*[[Battering Wave]] - a temple in [[Tsurlagol]], the Gateway to the [[Unapproachable East]].\n*[[Brynnlaw]] - a small temple on the island of Brynnlaw.\n*[[Cove of the Queen]] - a hidden harbor temple in [[Mintarn]] manned by pirates.\n*[[Darkwave Hall]] - a temple in [[Urmlaspyr]].\n*[[Grotto of the Queen]] - a temple in a small fishing village [[Lathtarl's Lantern]].\n* [[Hall of Black Waves]] - the temple on [[Ruathym]] Island, north of the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n*[[House of the Seas]] - a manor in [[Monksblade]] used by the Worshipers of the Wave as a holy house.\n*[[House on the Cliff]] - the biggest and richest influential temple located in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]].

On cargo ships, the sailors often tossed the transported valuable trade goods overboard to gain favorable winds, while the sounds of [[mouthpipe]]s played tunes dedicated to the goddess. When the danger was especially severe, the sailors made sure the goods tossed overboard contained living creatures. On some occasions, ships with Umberlant priests on board ran aground or foundered; in anger, the sailors turned against the priests who promised them safe passage. The desperate sailors made sure the treacherous priests of Umberlee were killed before the ship sank. There have been bloated corpses of the Bitch Queen's priests washed ashore with as many as 30 [[cutlass]]es stuck in them.\n\nBefore a voyage, sailors often left small tokens on Umberlee's shrine altars in hopes of calm waters. The most common tributes were flowers, [[candle]]s, coins, and [[candy]]. Such tributes were also often paid by merchants who transported their trade cargo by sea, the townsfolk of coastal cities and islands who did not have a powerful patron deity and were in danger of storms and hurricanes. When no other was present, the clergy of the Bitch Queen removed the offerings from the shrines, washing the altars with seawater and kelp to symbolize the goddess claiming her tithe.\n\nThe pirates and sailors of [[Alamber Sea]] paid some homage to Umberlee, who was not commonly worshiped in the region. They did send sacrifices into the sea's depths, but it usually consisted of unsalvageable goods and cargo.\n\nWorshipers of Umberlee in the pirate city of [[Tharkar]] often placed small sacrifices to the goddess. To protect the buildings from flooding and collapse, the folk drowned small critters like [[rat]]s and [[squirrel]]s in bowls of seawater decorated with [[seaweed]]. These sacrifices stood on plinths in their bowls, left alone in the buildings' basements, creating foul smells of wet decay.\n\nUmberlee's clergy performed the rite known as the Drowning. It was a ritualistic drowning of the Untaken supplicant (novice cleric of Umberlee). If they survived, they were confirmed in the service of the Queen of Depths.\n\nThe islanders from [[Kelthann]] eagerly accepted any dead body to perform a burial in their catacombs just to avoid performing burials at sea. Kelthanni believed that performing the rites of the burial at sea strengthened Umberlee. Those who performed the rites against the Kelthanni tradition were told that the earth was going to reject their bodies, and upon death, the Bitch Queen would claim their bodies and use them as her [[sea zombie]] servants.\n\nUmberlee was a common namesake for ships. A [[caravel]] called ''[[Umberlee's Get]]'' was helmed by a notorious and fierce sea wolf [[Jezgar Skentzin]] of the [[Inner Sea]] ''circa'' [[1359 DR]].\n\n===Holy Days===\n*'''First Tide''': This holy day was celebrated when the ice broke up in a harbor. It consisted of a [[flute]] and [[drum]]s parade through town with a caged animal, which was tied to a rock and then thrown into the sea. If it survived, it was magically healed and treated as a sacred animal with the rank of an Umberlant. This was an ancient custom with its roots in the days of old when Umberlee selected her clergy from among the human sacrifices drowned in the same manner as the animals of the First Tide.\n*'''Fair Seas Festival''': A Waterdevian holiday that took place at the end of [[Fleetswake]]. It was the festival to appease Umberlee during which the worshipers paid tithes by throwing the valuables and the coin made off of the temporarily raised docking fees into the deepest reaches of [[Waterdeep]]'s harbor. The valuables then were swept away by the currents and taken to [[Umberlee's Cache]], the deep chasm in the waters of Waterdeep..\n\n===Notable Worshipers===\n*[[Bjorn (sailor)|Bjorn]] - a young sailor in the crew of ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'' who sailed alongside [[Liriel Baenre]] in [[1361 DR]], often painting the pictures of Umberlee's wrath.\n*[[Caldos Hellingskorn]] - a mad [[Illuskan]] cleric of Umberlee on board of a pirate ship ''[[Stirge (ship)|Stirge]]'' in the late 15th century DR.\n*[[Shakey McGuire]] - a stuttering devout and an aspiring sailor from Spindrift Town.\n* [[Sister Foam]] - a chubby devotee of Umberlee who, alongside Captain [[Athgar]], traveled on board of the ''[[Tortured Tortle]]'' ship in [[1496 DR]].\n*[[Thur Aquarvol]] - the [[Merfolk]] [[shaman]] who demanded of the [[Lords' Alliance]] of Waterdeep for the coin collected during Fleetswake and the Fair Seas Festival to be smelted into an underwater statue of Umberlee in [[Ches]] of [[1368 DR]]. The demand was refused but commissioned a similar statue made of [[marble]] the following year.\n\n===Umberlee's Chosen ===\n*The very old [[kraken]] [[wizard]] [[Slarkrethel]] was a [[Chosen|Chosen of Umberlee]]. He was also the leader of the [[Kraken Society]].\n*The [[undead]] [[pirate]] [[Evendur Highcastle]].\n*The mysterious [[northlander]] woman, only known as the [[Storm Maiden]] who amassed a significant following and attempted to conquer the [[Sea of Swords]] but failed and along with her ship; she vanished ''circa'' [[1479 DR]].\n*[[Gar Shatterkeel]] was another one of Umberlee's chosen in 1490s DR who opened a rift to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] to draw power directly from it.",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "The most common manifestations of the Bitch Queen were waves and winds of the seas. Sailors knew that when storms hit their ships, and the winds or waves carried sinister cold laughter or hissing words, they were facing the cruel goddess herself.\n\nFollowing the Time of Troubles, Umberlee's powers were decreased, and she could manifest gales of wind four times a day. Her watery manifestation in the form of waves did not have many limitations in the sea. She used wave forms that reached heights of {{SI|160'|'\"|long=yes}} and which possessed considerable power. These waves could instantly kill an unlucky victim or grab and carry away items and treasures of value from the ships, including items such as ''[[ring]]s'' and [[gauntlets]].\n\nAnother common manifestation of the Great Queen of the Sea was in the shape of an aquatic monster of terrible size. She took on many shapes, including monstrous-sized sharks, [[kraken]]s, and aquatic [[undead]] and undead lake-dwelling monsters. Her most notable aspect was the kraken-like Dweller that grew within the Temple-Under-The-Sea, slowly increasing its strength and corruption influence."

It could be I have offended Umberlee in some way. She is such a temperamental - er - I mean, magnificent goddess of the vast ocean!''|[[Volothamp Geddarm]]}}<br />\nUmberlee was temperamental, evil, and malicious. She did not feel a moral obligation to honor any of her agreements or promises if the end result was not beneficial to her. That, and her desire for the valuables and excessive tribute, demonstrated her insatiable greed and cruelty. She was power-hungry and loved exercising it, toying with her worshipers. She fed her sadistic nature by destroying naval vessels and feeding shipwreck victims to her [[shark]]s while watching others drown.\n\nShe rarely favored individual mortals unless it benefited her in some way. Umberlee did not tolerate any one member of her clergy becoming famous and overshadowing the church or the goddess herself.",
        "Powers": "Umberlee's avatar had access to [[divine]] spells (except earth, fire, sun, thought, and time magic) and [[arcane]] spells (except earth and fire). All of the water magic the avatar was able to cast manifested at triple strength, making it extremely potent. The [[trident]] the avatar wielded was a powerful magical item that combined the powers of a ''[[trident of submission]]'' and a ''[[trident of fish command]]''. She could summon 6-12 [[shark]]s or 2-6 [[giant shark]]s to do her bidding every 30 minutes. Every 12 hours, the avatar of Umberlee was able to summon [[water elemental]]s of various sizes and power to serve her. All the creatures summoned by Umberlee were immune to any mind-affecting magic.",
        "Divine Realm": "After the [[Time of Troubles]], Umberlee resided in [[Blood Tor]], the 13th level of the [[Abyss]], flooded as befit its ruler.\n\nFollowing the dire changes brought on by the [[Spellplague]], Umberlee, along with [[Silvanus]], [[Auril]], [[Mielikki]], and [[Shiallia]] resided in the domain of the [[Deep Wilds]]. She made her home in that realm's deep, dark ocean.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Deities of Fury": "{{Main|Deities of Fury}}\nUmberlee was a member of the Deities of Fury, a group that included [[Auril]] and [[Malar]] and was led by the Storm Lord [[Talos]]. As Talos encroached upon Umberlee's portfolio since both deities ruled over [[Storm domain|storms]], she attempted to distract him with a romantic relationship. \n\nEven though Talos was her superior and patron, he often attempted to usurp Umberlee's power over sea storms and hurricanes, folding them under his own portfolio. Despite that, the Queen of the Depths positioned herself as a flirt, keeping herself in Talos' good graces. Although her ambitions were limited by not being able to affect land directly, given the opportunity, she would have gladly destroyed her patron, taking his portfolio of destruction for herself.\n\nThe closest deity Umberlee could consider an ally was Auril, the fellow member of the Deities of Fury. When Umberlee required aid, she was likely to call on the Frostmaiden.",
            "Deities of the First Circle": "{{Main|First Circle}}\nIn the late 15th century DR, Umberlee was a part of the loosely related group of deities known as the First Circle to their worshipers. The First Circle consisted of the gods who lorded over nature: Chauntea, [[Eldath]], [[Mielikki]], [[Silvanus]], Auril, [[Malar]], [[Talos]], and Umberlee herself."

        "Worshipers": {
            "Non-Human Worshipers": "Umberlee had worshipers among [[kraken]]s, [[sahuagin]], [[anguiliian]]s, [[water genasi]], and other evil sea creatures. A number of these were actually worshipers of [[Panzuriel]], a deity with no power on [[Toril]]; Umberlee merely granted spells on his behalf. In addition, some [[tanar'ri]] priests were known to pledge themselves to Umberlee's service.\n\nMost [[wereshark]]s, created by the Queen of the Depths herself as a way to undermine her bitter opponent Selûne, venerated Umberlee out of admiration rather than fear.",
            "Dogma": "The Undrowned and Umberlants held no ethical standards nor persuasions; the only thing that was set in stone was their belief in the cruelty and viciousness of the sea, the most dangerous place. The folk who were brave enough to travel the savage seas should be ready to pay the price for their challenge to the Bitch Queen's domain. The [[Church of Umberlee]]'s doctrine was fear; all were to tremble before the Queen's power, as her waves and winds were all-reaching. The mercy of the Great Queen of the Sea was to be bought with generous offerings, as they brought fair winds. All who dared to travel through her domain were to know that Umberlee controlled the monsters of the deep and the drowned dead. Priests and priestesses of Umberlee were to spread the holy word of the Bitch Queen and spread the fear of her rage, and perform no service in her name without collecting high tithe. They were to promote the fear of Umberlee's waves and winds unless her clergy accompanied the travelers. The final divine directive was for the followers of Umberlee's faith to slay anyone claiming the storms over the seas were [[Talos]]' doing.",

They did send sacrifices into the sea's depths, but it usually consisted of unsalvageable goods and cargo.\n\nWorshipers of Umberlee in the pirate city of [[Tharkar]] often placed small sacrifices to the goddess. To protect the buildings from flooding and collapse, the folk drowned small critters like [[rat]]s and [[squirrel]]s in bowls of seawater decorated with [[seaweed]]. These sacrifices stood on plinths in their bowls, left alone in the buildings' basements, creating foul smells of wet decay.\n\nUmberlee's clergy performed the rite known as the Drowning. It was a ritualistic drowning of the Untaken supplicant (novice cleric of Umberlee). If they survived, they were confirmed in the service of the Queen of Depths.\n\nThe islanders from [[Kelthann]] eagerly accepted any dead body to perform a burial in their catacombs just to avoid performing burials at sea. Kelthanni believed that performing the rites of the burial at sea strengthened Umberlee. Those who performed the rites against the Kelthanni tradition were told that the earth was going to reject their bodies, and upon death, the Bitch Queen would claim their bodies and use them as her [[sea zombie]] servants.\n\nUmberlee was a common namesake for ships. A [[caravel]] called ''[[Umberlee's Get]]'' was helmed by a notorious and fierce sea wolf [[Jezgar Skentzin]] of the [[Inner Sea]] ''circa'' [[1359 DR]].",
            "Holy Days": "*'''First Tide''': This holy day was celebrated when the ice broke up in a harbor. It consisted of a [[flute]] and [[drum]]s parade through town with a caged animal, which was tied to a rock and then thrown into the sea. If it survived, it was magically healed and treated as a sacred animal with the rank of an Umberlant. This was an ancient custom with its roots in the days of old when Umberlee selected her clergy from among the human sacrifices drowned in the same manner as the animals of the First Tide.\n*'''Fair Seas Festival''': A Waterdevian holiday that took place at the end of [[Fleetswake]]. It was the festival to appease Umberlee during which the worshipers paid tithes by throwing the valuables and the coin made off of the temporarily raised docking fees into the deepest reaches of [[Waterdeep]]'s harbor. The valuables then were swept away by the currents and taken to [[Umberlee's Cache]], the deep chasm in the waters of Waterdeep..",
            "Notable Worshipers": "*[[Bjorn (sailor)|Bjorn]] - a young sailor in the crew of ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'' who sailed alongside [[Liriel Baenre]] in [[1361 DR]], often painting the pictures of Umberlee's wrath.\n*[[Caldos Hellingskorn]] - a mad [[Illuskan]] cleric of Umberlee on board of a pirate ship ''[[Stirge (ship)|Stirge]]'' in the late 15th century DR.\n*[[Shakey McGuire]] - a stuttering devout and an aspiring sailor from Spindrift Town.\n* [[Sister Foam]] - a chubby devotee of Umberlee who, alongside Captain [[Athgar]], traveled on board of the ''[[Tortured Tortle]]'' ship in [[1496 DR]].\n*[[Thur Aquarvol]] - the [[Merfolk]] [[shaman]] who demanded of the [[Lords' Alliance]] of Waterdeep for the coin collected during Fleetswake and the Fair Seas Festival to be smelted into an underwater statue of Umberlee in [[Ches]] of [[1368 DR]]. The demand was refused but commissioned a similar statue made of [[marble]] the following year.",

        "History": "[[File:Umberlee and sailors.jpg|thumb|''Avatar of Umberlee menacing a boat.''|370x370px]]\nAt some point before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Umberlee flooded the city of [[Memnon]] and a part of [[Calimshan]] to inspire worship by fear. Since then, her temple in Memnon, adjacent to the city's cemetery, was kept in impeccable cleanliness with all its tiles polished to brilliance by the devotees of the goddess of the sea.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]] during the [[Time of Troubles]], Umberlee manifested herself in the Sea of Fallen Stars, where she entertained herself by destroying pirate islands with her storms and minions. Umberlee took an opportunity to visit the island of [[Kelthann]] during the Time of Troubles and exact revenge on the denizens of the island for their belief that winter storms in the sea came from [[Grumbar]]'s rivalry with the Bitch Queen. She made several attempts to wash the Kelthanni off the island with her powerful storms but failed to achieve her goal, strengthening the islanders' belief in Grumbar, to Umberlee's disdain.\n\nAfter the end of that calamitous period of time, Kelthann remained ravaged by storms for some time, although not as powerful as when the Queen's avatar was personally stirring the sea. With the efforts of the alliance of merchants, inhabitants of the coastal cities, and the [[Iron Throne]], of all people, Umberlee was appeased and calmed the Sea of Fallen Stars by [[1360 DR]]–[[1361 DR]]. During the same period of time, the Queen of the Depths was responsible for the creation of weresharks within the Realms to spite Selûne .\n\nIn 1360 DR, during the [[Crusade]] against the [[Tuigan]] invasion, Umberlee was responsible for almost destroying the ship that carried king [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] across the [[Lake of Dragons]]. The vessel ''[[Welleran]]'' failed to pay the tithe to the Queen of the Sea and only stopped the deadly storm after King Azoun's scribe sacrificed his most prized possession to the sea, the historical records of the ongoing Crusades.\n\nIn [[1363 DR]], during the [[Day of Wonders]] festival in Waterdeep, a wondrous mechanical [[dragon turtle]] sank after completing one lap around the harbor, becoming a part of the treasures of [[Umberlee's Cache]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], Umberlee led her local priestess [[Tasina Alcrest]] to acquire a mysterious artifact of power and deliver it to the Temple-Under-The-Sea in the Fiddler's Green underwater region of the Sea of Swords. There, a horrific sea-beast called the Dweller lived. That creature was one of the first aspects, the first avatars of the goddess since the Time of Troubles. The kraken-like Dweller grew and expanded its corrupting influence, nourished by the priestesses and [[sahuagin]] worshipers alongside Umberlee's humanoid avatar manifestation.\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], recently abandoned [[Port Llast]] was claimed by Umberlee and her sea monsters.\n\nAround the same year, a [[northlander]] who called herself the [[Storm Maiden]] led her followers on a crazed mission to take over the [[Sea of Swords]], consumed by the power of the Bitch Queen. The Storm Maiden was defeated and disappeared along with her ship.\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], Umberlee pummeled [[Neverwinter]] with a devastating storm after [[Dagult Neverember]] offended the goddess by restricting regular sacrifices to her.\n\nIn 1490s DR, Umberlee contributed to the destruction unleashed upon the [[Sword Coast]] by the four elemental prophets. She empowered [[Gar Shatterkeel]] as her chosen, and [[Olhydra]] gave him powers of one of the prophets. After the prophets' defeat, Gar found a way back to Toril and was re-empowered by his otherworldly patrons. Umberlee gifted him a powerful artifact, a [[trident]] called the [[Wave]]. With the Bitch Queen's guidance, he was able to find an elemental node off the coast of [[Turmish]] at [[Umberlee’s Maw]], opening the rift to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a book called ''[[Shanties for the Bitch Queen]]'' was published and beloved by fishermen of the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Rumors and Legends": "*According to one legend, Umberlee once had a relationship with [[Iakhovas]], variously described as a [[megalodon]], [[wereshark]], or sharkwere. She even granted him immortality. However, their relationship fell apart, and she sought revenge on him.\n\n*There were some superstitions among the seafaring folk and pirates of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. They believed that cutting hair and trimming nails while at sea angered Umberlee, who thought grooming to be an offering to her enemy Sune. It was forbidden to say the word \"drown\" while at sea as it was believed it attracted Umberlee's attention. They also believed that if you fell overboard, it was useless to fight Umberlee's will and learn to swim. \n\n*Legends claimed that Umberlee was responsible for the creation of [[cyclopskin]]. She placed a curse on [[giant]]s, [[firbolg]]s, or some such creatures for their refusal to acknowledge the Bitch Queen's control over winter storms."
