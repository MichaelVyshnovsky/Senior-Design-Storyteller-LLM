        "mainbody": "'''Vigilante''' were individuals who decided to take the law into their own hands.",
        "Culture": "Some vigilantes were wronged previously in their life and sought revenge, while others wished to attone for their own past infractions by aiding the cause of justice. Some vigilantes worked for local law enforcement figures, but many decided to go their own route. They often worked alone but held no qualms about using bounty hunters or [[adventurer]]s to help their progress.",
        "Abilities": "They used a combination of [[magical]] and mundane abilities to help solve crimes. They could ''[[detect evil]]'' at will. They had access to a limited variety of useful [[arcane]] [[spell]]s including ''[[speak with dead]]'' and ''[[dimensional anchor]]''. They could \"smite\" targets whom they personally witnessed committing a crime. This ability needed to be used within three days of the crime taking place. Successfully smiting the target caused more physical harm to them when the vigilante attacked them with a weapon.",
        "Possessions": "In addition to a normal assortment of melee weapons, vigilantes often carried a [[net]] in order to capture their targets.",
        "Notable Vigilantes": "* [[Surrolph Hlakken]], a [[horse]] merchant from [[Waterdeep]].\n* [[Naneatha Lharilstar]], a courtesan at [[Piergeiron's Palace]].\n* [[Jurisk Ulhammond]], a money-lender from Waterdeep."
