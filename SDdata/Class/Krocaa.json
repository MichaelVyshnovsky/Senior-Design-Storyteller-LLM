        "Description": "Krocaa appeared as a perfect specimen of the aarakocra species, with blue eyes and golden plummage except on his head, where the feathers were red. He was far larger than any ordinary aarakocra, though, possessing a {{SIAdj|30|ft}} wingspan.",
        "Abilities": "Krocaa's avatar flew with perfect maneuverability, and was able to use his mighty wings to create wind akin to a powerful ''[[gust of wind]]'' spell. In combat, he carried two ''[[javelin|javelins +2]]'' that returned to his hands after being thrown. Additionally, Krocaa's avatar could summon two powerful [[air elemental]]s once each day.",
        "Relationships": "Krocaa normally kept to himself, but he was on good terms with the [[Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim|Great Caliph]] of the [[djinni]] and the nobility of the [[air elemental]]s.",
        "Worship": "Aarakocra offered sacrifices and tithes to Krocaa, normally in the form of [[gems]] or the [[egg]]s of evil creatures such as [[harpies]]. They gave these offerings at the end of every month and on various tribal holidays, placing them in the peak of a holy mountain to be taken away by the sacred [[eagle]]s roosting there.",
        "History": "In aarakocraa legend, Krocaa created the first of their species by evolving them from [[giant eagle]]s, giving them intelligence and teaching them to defend themselves."
