        "mainbody": "Krocaa was an obscure god of the aarakocra.\nKrocaa appeared as a perfect specimen of the aarakocra species, with blue eyes and golden plummage except on his head, where the feathers were red. He was far larger than any ordinary aarakocra, though, possessing a  wingspan.\nKrocaas avatar flew with perfect maneuverability, and was able to use his mighty wings to create wind akin to a powerful gust of wind spell. In combat, he carried two javelins +2 that returned to his hands after being thrown. Additionally, Krocaas avatar could summon two powerful air elementals once each day.\nKrocaa normally kept to himself, but he was on good terms with the Great Caliph of the djinni and the nobility of the air elementals.\nAarakocra offered sacrifices and tithes to Krocaa, normally in the form of gems or the eggs of evil creatures such as harpies. They gave these offerings at the end of every month and on various tribal holidays, placing them in the peak of a holy mountain to be taken away by the sacred eagles roosting there.\nIn aarakocraa legend, Krocaa created the first of their species by evolving them from giant eagles, giving them intelligence and teaching them to defend themselves."
