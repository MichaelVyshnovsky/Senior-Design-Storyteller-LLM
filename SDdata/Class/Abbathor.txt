Trove Lord
Abbathor (|audio=Abbathor.ogg ) was the neutral evil dwarven god of greed The Great Master of Greed represented the major weakness of dwarvenkind, the treasurelust that was their worst aspect. The Trove Lord was once concerned with the natural beauty of gems, but after being denied the position he had coveted since birth, he abandoned dwarven honor for trickery and would do whatever it took to never be denied again. 
Despite his great height (by dwarven standards) appearing as a  or  tall dwarf, Abbathor was a fat, squat, and hunched figure. He seemed to slither and slide as he walked and was often rubbing his hands together, though never made much noise. He covered his sallow skin in leather armor and furs, both fashioned from the skins of that which died opposing him.
Abbathors piggy eyes were said to be yellow-green, burning yellow when he was eager for or claiming treasure while hooded and green when scheming for it or thwarted in his attempt to get it. His nose was sharp and hooked like that of a giant eagle and it was said his voice was wheedling, harsh and husky.
Abbathor was an intensely greedy deity, desiring valuables to a degree best described as sensual. He unconsciously carressed any gold or gems he was carrying, seemingly overwhelmed by the sensation, and was envious of others riches, unable to control himself at the sight of a particularly expensive item and willingly to steal or slay for it on the spot. He believed in the acquisition of all forms of wealth by any and all means necessary.
Abbathors priests dressed in red leather armor and leather caps They shared Abbathors stance on what wealth was to be obtained and how (namely all of it and however possible). His holy days were on the solar eclipse and he demanded the sacrifice of both blood and gems annually.
