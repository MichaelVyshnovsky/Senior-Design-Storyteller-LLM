        "Personality": "The Bedine believed in an entity called [[At'ar the Merciless]]. She was thought to be a spiteful woman who enjoyed an adulterous relationship. This woman was the result of stories about Amaunator becoming warped over time to the point of the entity becoming unrecognizable. The real Amaunator was a cautious god who did not just try to write down everything to be certain about it, but made sure to go through the pain of contracting, signing, sealing, and notarizing everything as well, a trait similar to the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]].\n\nAmaunator was viewed as a stern and unforgiving deity dedicated to law and order above all else. Though not concerned with balanced natural order like [[Silvanus]], he instead advocated for kept promises, contracts, and even that political order be kept among the gods.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 250px\n| source = The mispunctuation that made Amaunator the god of time\n| text   = …Amaunator shall be responsible for all time. any misrepresentations of his or his followers, If so deemed the fault of Amaunator…\n}}\nAmaunator tended to ignore the spirit of the law in favor of the letter of it.

        "Abilities": {
            "Manifestations": "Amaunator appeared fairly often in the form of a woman clad in a flowing, opalescent dress with an image of a [[balance]] made of practically see-through gold upon it. When this manifestation appeared to a person, this person could determine whether he stood in favor or disfavor of the god by looking at the scale. If it scaled to the left, he could be sure to spend the next seven years in poverty, debt, and servitude while losing his fortune. If the scale tilted to the right, the recipient of the manifestation could expect himself good fortune in the material sense. If the scales were balanced, the recipient was receiving an invitation to enter Amaunator's clergy.\n\nAnother manifestation of his were thirteen [[giant hyena]]s. These were sent by the Yellow God to punish people who deserved such or to avenge people who did not have the ability to do it themselves. When these hyenas appeared the offender was killed by them and the body was ripped apart to cover 1 acre (4047 square meters).\n\n[[Favored animal]]s of Amaunator were tan [[dog]]s, cream-colored [[cat]]s, pure white [[wolf|wolves]], birds of prey, especially [[sunfalcon]]s, and white [[stallion]]s, which were sent to show his favor or disfavor. The Keeper of the Eternal Sun's [[favored monster]]s were [[emerald dragon]]s, [[sapphire dragon]]s, [[steel dragon]]s, [[golem]]s, and [[tako]]s. His [[favored mineral]]s were [[topaz]] and any red-colored [[gem]]. His [[favored plant]]s were yellow-eyed [[daisy|daisies]], sunflowers, and golden lilies."
        },
        "Possessions": "Amaunator's avatar wore a magistrate's uniform, and appeared holding a legal tome and a scepter, the ''scepter of the eternal sun''.\n\nHe once owned an oak staff with astral diamonds at the base and a sun-shaped one on the head that was worth 23,000 [[gp]].",
        "Divine Realm": "Amaunator's [[divine realm]], the [[Keep of the Eternal Sun]] used to be on [[Mechanus]]. He lost, with the [[Karsus's Folly|fall of Netheril]], enough followers to die of neglect. His death robbed his ability to maintain his divine realm and his corpse was ejected to the [[Astral Plane]].\n\nOnce he came back to life, he created the [[astral dominion]] [[Eternal Sun]] and lived there with [[Siamorphe]] and [[Waukeen]].",
        "Activities": "Amaunator preached that people needed to follow the law to the letter. The reason for this was the belief that laws were the foundations on which any society was built and disrespecting the law would inevitably cause the collapse of any society. The same adherence was also extended to traditions.\n\nThe Yellow God also taught that people had to familiarize themselves with the law to get an understanding how to act in a proper manner that saved them from getting punished. He also wanted people to be organized individuals who met their commitments and were always on time.\n\nHis message also extended to hierarchies mortals made for themselves. The Keeper of the Eternal Sun told his followers to adhere to their superiors. The idea behind it was that faithful service would yield them rewards while failure to do so punishment. That said, people were told to keep tabs on their superiors' decisions. This was to increase the number of precedents to draw from and help to standardize rulings and with it the relevance of Amaunator's message.",
        "Relationships": "Amaunator was the judge over the Pantheon Contour in the Netherese pantheon. He was named the god of time on the basis of a mispunctuation. He never acted on this claim for he did not want to be on bad footing with Mystryl who was the goddess of time in practice.\n\nAfter returning, he was served by [[Siamorphe]] as his [[exarch]] and lived with [[Waukeen]] on his [[astral domain]] [[Eternal Sun]].\n\nApparently, he found [[Sune]] attractive.",

They were called on to witness contracts and apply a signatory stamp with the symbol of Amaunator to verify its validity.",
        "History": {
            "Before Karsus's Folly": "Amaunator was a greater deity during the days of ancient Netheril. He was the one who judged over the [[Pantheon Contour]], an agreement between deities.",
            "After Karsus's Folly": "When [[Karsus's Folly|Netheril fell]], Amaunator's worshiper-base shrunk to Netheril's lower and middle class. These people abandoned his faith for they believed that he knowingly did nothing to stop the disaster.\n\nOn the mortals' side, various theories were concocted to explain Amaunator's non-existence. Starting with having moved to somewhere else than [[Faerûn]] like another world or [[Kara-Tur]]'s [[pantheon]] to having become or absorbed by something else like [[At'ar the Merciless]] or [[Lathander]]. \n\nBelief in Amaunator lived on in at least three different ways. First, the Bedine belief of At'ar, the Merciless. This was the result of Netherese survivors telling stories about the Yellow God to the Bedine, which then were twisted over time into that of a woman who was married to [[Talos|Kozah]] but pursued an adulterous relationship with [[Cyric|N'asr]]. This belief received no divine support and At'ar had no [[cleric]]s. The third belief was in one of Lathander's heresies, either the [[Three-Faced Sun heresy]] or the [[Risen Sun heresy]]. The former was the idea that the [[sun]] was an [[overgod]] who had two [[aspect]]s that were possible objects of worship for mortals. Not all but some believed that Amaunator would return to resume his role as one of these two aspects. The second heresy was the idea that Lathander was the reincarnated form of Amaunator. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], their radicals believed that Lathander revealing himself as Amaunator was close. Faced with this heresy, Lathander had three options, accept it and turn it into the effective truth, reject it and lose potential worshipers, or let it be and gain more worshipers at the cost of his authority losing its weight. He chose the last one.",
            "Return of Amaunator": "In [[1371 DR|1371]]/[[1372 DR]], high-ranked [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of Lathander began to receive messages regarding a mysterious event called the \"Deliverance\", leading them to begin an aggressive recruitment campaign. It was not clear whether this had anything to do with Amaunator.\n\nAmaunator's return was heralded by a [[fire genasi]] called [[Daelegoth Orndeir]]. The man was a believer in the aforementioned Risen Sun heresy and made it his goal to make it the mainstream branch of Lathander's church. He strengthened his base and power in intra-church politics, developed the ''[[Amaunator's eternal sun]]'' [[spell]], and managed to get hold over the ''[[Shard of the Sun]]'', a [[holy relic]] of Amaunator. He claimed he had seen visions that Amaunator's ascension was nigh and gathered his people to [[Elversult]] to witness the sign of the ascension in [[1374 DR]]. The sign he referred to were the effects of the ''Amaunator's eternal sun'' spell, which he developed beforehand. This made people believe him and people flocked to the [[church of Lathander]] to join the [[church of Amaunator]] while the leaders of Lathander's church were not sure what to do.\n\nLathander was revealed to be Amaunator in the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], just after the Spellplague. It was not clear whether it was the truth or he embraced a heresy and turned it into the effective truth.",
            "Post-Spellplague Era": "After the [[Spellplague]], Amaunator became an established [[greater deity]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]. He fulfilled the role of timekeeper among the gods.\n\nHe had people who primarily worshiped him as Lathander, his youthful aspect - something Amaunator actively encouraged.\n\nThe city of [[Elturel]] benefited from a shining globe that was sometimes accredited to Amaunator. However, it was unclear whether the god had anything to do with the sphere. The only one who knew the answer was the High Observer of the city.",
            "Post-Second Sundering": "In [[1486 DR]], Lathander returned according to his Chosen [[Stedd Whitehorn]].{{Cite digital book/The Reaver/Kindle|1330-1333}} By the year [[1491 DR]], Amaunator and Lathander were once again worshiped as separate beings.<ref> It is unknown if they were actually separate beings by this time or one was the aspect of the other.{{Speculation}}"

            "Heresies": "The church of Lathander was not without its notable heresies, including the [[Risen Sun heresy]] and the [[Three-Faced Sun heresy]], both of which were prominently focused on the return of Amaunator. The former later proved true when Amaunator returned."
