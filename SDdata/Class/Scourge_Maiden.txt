Scourge maidens were elite warriors dedicated to the goddess of pain and torture, Loviatar. They considered the latter of her domains to be an art form and spent their lives perfecting it as their craft. As per their namesake, their preferred weapon, along with being Loviatars favorite torture device, was the scourge or many-headed-whip.
The maidens of Loviatars inner circle would work in small groups in service to her temples. Their duties included the protection and defense of high-level priestesses, the torture of their prisoners, and punishing offenders of their faith. They were capable of instilling immense despair and sadness in their foes.
