        "mainbody": "arkbringers were specialty priests devoted to Moander, the Rotting God.\nDarkbringers were both male and female and could be any race.\nAny spell from the plant sphere cast by a darkbringer experienced double the normal area of effect and duration. They could cast several spells on a daily basis including entangle, puffball, handfang, speed rot, plant growth, rising rot, speed rot, spirit trap of the Darkbringer, roots of the assassin, and tentacle of withering.\nThe effects of the plant growth spell varied when cast by a darkbringer. Firstly, the affected vegetation rotted and died after a tenday unless a dispel magic spell was cast upon them. Secondly, all plant life within  of the spot where the spell was cast would become disease-ridden and die within a month unless a bless spell followed by dispel magic was cast within the area.\nDarkbringers did not have restrictions on the weapons they wielded in combat or the armor they were permitted to wear."
