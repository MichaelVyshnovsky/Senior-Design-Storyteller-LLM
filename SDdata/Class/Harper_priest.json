        "mainbody": "Harper priests were those clerics within the Harpers who chose to form a stronger connection with the deities that were considered patrons of the organization. \nMany of the clerics who served in the Harpers were either human, half-elven, or elven, though this was not always the case. While many of them revered the Harpers patron deities, it was not required that they serve one of these faiths.\nIn order to become a Harper priest, an individual had to be sponsored by a Harper in good standing and face approval by the High Harpers. Additionally, their patron deity could not be one who promoted slaughter or excessive destruction in the world.\nLike their fellow field agents and mages who acted with the blessing of the Harpers, these priests had a knack for acquiring useful lore about the world around them.\nAs they owned their skills with wielding the Power, Harper priests garnered a number of blessings associated with the deities who looked favorably upon the Harpers. These blessings included\n* With the pool of Eldath, priests could create water out of nothing.\n* The staff of Silvanus allowed them to hone their martial skill with quarterstaves.\n* Through the wisdom of Deneir, they were often able to avoid harmful runes or glyphs.\n* The holy voice of Milil gave a boon to their confidence and allure of their personality.\n* By Mielikkis grace step they could move with great alacrity.\n* Lliiras abundant joy allowed them to face down frightful situations. \n* Oghma wisdom granted them great insight into their understanding of the world.\n* The grace of Mystra protected from from harmful magic.\n* When Tymora smiled upon them, priests could draw upon her good fortune and luck.\nHarper priests traveled the Realms alongside their fellow Harper allies and others who shared their altruistic outlook, or journeyed alone, confident they could count on their comrades when the need arose."
