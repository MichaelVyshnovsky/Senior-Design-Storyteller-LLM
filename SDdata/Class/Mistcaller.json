        "mainbody": "Mistcallers were specialty priests devoted to Leira, the Lady of the Mists.\nMistcallers were always humans or gnomes, though other gnomes often looked down upon their brethren who chose this path.\nMany mistcallers were skilled ventriloquists and in the art of disguise. In addition to their clerical spells, mistcallers could cast wizard spells from the school of illusion. They were able to cast illusion or phantasm spells from scrolls without the need for a read magic spell. They excelled at seeing through illusions created by others. They could cast the following spells once per day impenetrable falsehood, phantasmal force, audible glamer, misdirection, shadow magic, demi-shadow magic, disbelief, and mislead. Extremely powerful mistcallers could create a permanent illusion three times per tenday.\nMistcallers were strictly forbidden to cast the true seeing spell or use any magic item with similar affects.\nThey only wielded bludgeoning weapons. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear. However, armor of any type completely negated their spellcasting abilities and other magical powers."
