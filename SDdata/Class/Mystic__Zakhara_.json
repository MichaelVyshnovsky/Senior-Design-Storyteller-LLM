        "mainbody": "'''Mystics''' were bizarre priests in [[Zakhara]] whose powers were rumored to move both men and mountains. Mystics often gained spiritual awareness or revelations through dance, meditation, or other eccentric means.<ref group=\"note\">Mystic was a [[cleric]] class kit for the [[Al-Qadim]] setting.",

            "Anchorites & Hermits": "Meditation and peaceful solitude granted clerical powers to anchorites and hermits, often in the form of simple tasks or hobbies such as singing or taking a long walk."

        "Possessions": "Most mystics were very poor when they first began their unique spiritual journeys but amassed and enjoyed wealth as their powers increased.",
        "Benefits": "Mystics attracted followers who were fanatically loyal to them as well as their religion.",
        "Hindrances": "[[Ethoist|Ethoists]], moralists, and [[Pragmatist|pragmatists]] regarded mystics with disdain.\n\nSince mystics attained their clerical powers through a unique method, preventing them from performing their chosen method blocked them from their powers. For example, binding the hands and feet of a member of the [[Dancing Dwarves]] would effectively prevent them from calling upon their clerical spells."
