        "mainbody": "Mystics were bizarre priests in Zakhara whose powers were rumored to move both men and mountains. Mystics often gained spiritual awareness or revelations through dance, meditation, or other eccentric means.Mystic was a cleric class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.\nMen and women of all races could become mystics, though most of them were possessed of wild and chaotic natures.\nAs free priests, mystics could worship any god they chose without conforming to the hierarchical society that other Zakharan priests were part of. This method often left them in direct opposition with moralists.\nThese mystics only gained their clerical powers after completing a chaotic dance.\nMeditation and peaceful solitude granted clerical powers to anchorites and hermits, often in the form of simple tasks or hobbies such as singing or taking a long walk.\nMost mystics were very poor when they first began their unique spiritual journeys but amassed and enjoyed wealth as their powers increased.\nMystics attracted followers who were fanatically loyal to them as well as their religion.\nEthoists, moralists, and pragmatists regarded mystics with disdain.\nSince mystics attained their clerical powers through a unique method, preventing them from performing their chosen method blocked them from their powers. For example, binding the hands and feet of a member of the Dancing Dwarves would effectively prevent them from calling upon their clerical spells."
