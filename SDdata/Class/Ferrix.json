        "mainbody": "'''Ferrix''', also known as the '''Lady of Weretigresses'''",
        "Description": "Ferrix appeared as a {{SIrange|8|12|ft}} weretiger; she preferred her hybrid form and was usually in it, but she took tigress form when hunting. In contrast to regular weretigers, who had orange fur with black stripes, Ferrix's fur has an exceptionally beautiful honey-brown sheen.",
        "Personality": "Ferrix was an eternally, insatiably curious goddess who enjoyed knowledge for its own sake and desired to know everything, no matter how useless or trivial. Indeed, for all her great store of accumulated knowledge she failed to effectively seperate worthwhile and worthless information. She was very intelligent yet unwise, a flighty goddess readily distracted by the new or unexpected.\n\nFerrix was often playful and also vain, such that she was easily swayed by flattery and gifts of beautiful objects like [[gem]]s, their actual value being irrelevant when weighed against their appearance. If teased or mocked she could be spiteful and vicious, and when dealing with prey could be outright cruel.",
        "Powers": "Avatars of Ferrix were skilled [[fighter]]s and powerful [[druid]]s, in addition to having spells of charming and combat. The lycanthropic goddess fought with a powerful combination of savage bites and raking clawing, and could leap dozens of feet up, across, and even backwards as if she was wearing ''[[boots of striding and springing]]''.\n\nThe alluring avatar was able to ''[[charm feline]]s'' at will (not that any natural feline would attack her), and also could potently [[charm person or mammal|charm mammals and people]] several times per day. Once a day each, her intimidating roar could cause ''[[fear]]'' in her enemies and her purr could ''[[calm emotions]]'', and three times each day her licking could ''[[cure critical wounds]]''. She was immune to [[poison]]s, [[disease]]s, paralyzation, and mundane [[weapon]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Ferrix wore a [[Tiger eye agate|tiger eye]] ''[[ring of human influence]]'' on her right front paw.",
        "Realm": "Ferrix made her home in the [[Brux]] layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].",
        "Activities": "Ferrix roamed the Beastlands hunting, prowling and demanding adoration from others. Sometimes she did so with the Cat Lord's pride, usually in tigress form.",
        "Relationships": "Ferrix and Balador were linked through their complementary natures; she was the exact opposite of her brother, possessing the intellect and quick wit he lacked, while he in turn had a depth of wisdom unfound in his sister. Some myths said that the duo were themselves complementary to the evil [[lycanthrope]] siblings, [[Daragor]] of the [[werewolves]] and [[Eshebala]] of the [[werefox]]es. This link might bear mythological significance, to the point that their collective fates were inextricably interwoven, either doomed to fight or embrace in the end. In any case, all of them were mostly chaotic and willful, such that if that were true, they would rather continue with their own plans and purposes than be informed of their destiny.\n\nIn terms of positive relations, Ferrix was an ally of the [[Elven pantheon|Elven god]] of hunting [[Solonor Thelandira]], on good terms with [[Nobanion]], a bestial [[demipower]] of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]],",
        "Worshipers": "Ferrix's worshipers were weretigers, but like most of the other lycanthropic deities she lacked [[priest]]s or [[shaman]]s.",
        "History": "In mythology, Ferrix was Mother Tigress to Balador's Father Bear. The two were often presented as servitors to a great nature or druidic deity, who gifted Balador freedom in return for loyal, loving service. However, Balador would not accept his freedom alone, and pleaded with his master and mentor to release his sister. Their god was a soft-hearted one, and so agreed to Balador's request despite Ferrix's own lacking loyalty and reliability."
