        "mainbody": "A Gondsman was a specialty priest of the Church of Gond in the 14 century DR.\nThe major spheres that Gondsmen had access to for spells were all, astral, combat, divination, elemental, numbers, protection, sun, and wards. The minor spheres that they had access to for spells were charm, creation, guardian, healing, and necromantic. Some particular spells they knew how to cast included animate object, probing arm, stoneskin, thunder staff, tree steed, and unseen servant.\nUnlike the specialty priests of some faiths, Gondsmen could neither command nor turn undead.\nBeyond their magical abilities, Gondsmen were often proficient armorers, blacksmiths, carpenters, engineers, gemcutters, leatherworkers, miners, potters, stonemasons, or weaponsmiths.\nGondsmen often included lockpicks on the crimson sashes they wore, which were adorned in various tools and equipment. The armor they wore ranged as good as plate mail, though they never wielded shields. In terms of weaponry they favored bludgeoning weapons, crossbows, and firearms if they were available, such as the arquebus.\nFollowing the Time of Troubles, Gondsmen were chiefly the ones responsible for the manufacture and proliferation of firearms across Faerûn, shipping them to western ports. Over time they created and introduced the arquebus, blunderbuss, and ribald.\nCirca 1370 DR,Faiths & Avatars makes reference to a past event occurring in  on page 46. the proportion of Gondsmen on the island nation of Lantan was about twenty for every cleric, while throughout the rest of Faerûn the proportion of clerics to Gondsmen was typically 15 to 1. The majority of Gondsmen found in Faerûn were merchants from Lantan. Around this time gnomes were also beginning to take up this vocation, though it was frowned upon in most gnomish communities.\nFollowing the Spellplague, \"Gondsmen\" became the preferred term for both worshipers and members of the Church of Gonds clergy."
