        "mainbody": "A '''Gondsman''' was a [[specialty priest]] of the [[Church of Gond]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "The major [[sphere]]s that Gondsmen had access to for [[spell]]s were [[all sphere|all]], [[astral sphere|astral]], [[combat sphere|combat]], [[divination sphere|divination]], [[elemental sphere|elemental]], [[numbers sphere|numbers]], [[protection sphere|protection]], [[sun sphere|sun]], and [[wards sphere|wards]]. The minor spheres that they had access to for spells were [[charm sphere|charm]], [[creation sphere|creation]], [[guardian sphere|guardian]], [[healing sphere|healing]], and [[necromantic sphere|necromantic]]. Some particular spells they knew how to cast included ''[[animate object]]'', ''[[probing arm]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[thunder staff]]'', ''[[tree steed]]'', and ''[[unseen servant]]''.\n\nUnlike the specialty priests of some faiths, Gondsmen could neither [[command undead|''command'']] nor ''[[turn undead]]''.\n\nBeyond their magical abilities, Gondsmen were often proficient armorers, blacksmiths, carpenters, [[engineer]]s, gemcutters, leatherworkers, miners, potters, stonemasons, or weaponsmiths.",
        "Possessions": "Gondsmen often included [[lockpicks]] on the crimson [[sash]]es they wore, which were adorned in various tools and equipment. The armor they wore ranged as good as [[plate mail]], though they never wielded [[shield]]s. In terms of weaponry they favored bludgeoning weapons, [[crossbow]]s, and [[firearm]]s if they were available, such as the [[arquebus]].",
        "History": "Following the [[Time of Troubles]], Gondsmen were chiefly the ones responsible for the manufacture and proliferation of firearms across [[Faer没n]], shipping them to western ports. Over time they created and introduced the arquebus, [[blunderbuss]], and [[ribald]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1370 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">''Faiths & Avatars'' makes reference to a past event occurring in {{Yearlink|1370}} on page 46. the proportion of Gondsmen on the island nation of [[Lantan]] was about twenty for every [[cleric]], while throughout the rest of Faer没n the proportion of clerics to Gondsmen was typically 15 to 1. The majority of Gondsmen found in Faer没n were merchants from Lantan. Around this time [[gnome]]s were also beginning to take up this vocation, though it was frowned upon in most gnomish communities.\n\nFollowing the [[Spellplague]], \"Gondsmen\" became the preferred term for both worshipers and members of the Church of Gond's clergy.{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|2}}<ref>"
