        "mainbody": "'''Brimstone Speakers''' were divine casters that saw [[truespeak]] as a gift from their gods. They blended divine magic with truespeak in a way that allowed them to breathe flame, and to summon [[celestial]]s, in their unending quest to purge all evil.",
        "Abilities": "A brimstone speaker's signature ability, the first one they uncovered, was an [[utterance]] such that it granted them a ''tongue of flames'' which scoured {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} straight ahead of them with fiery power. The next ability they mastered was the ''heavenly entreaty''; while at first, it was lesser, fetching only the aid of a [[Bralani]] eladrin, with increasing mastery they gained the ability to summon [[word archon]]s or [[ghaele|ghaele eladrins]], and finally an [[astral deva]]. Alongside their increasing mastery, they developed a harder-burning ''tongue of flames''.\n\nTheir practice of [[the Power]] lagged somewhat, and one who pursued the path to the end would likely never achieve its strongest spells.",
        "Relationships": "Brimstone speakers were common in the churches of [[Lathander]] and more rarely [[Kossuth]]. Common starts as brimstone speakers came from a prospective speaker's superiors noticing they combined zealotry with scholarly patience, and being taught the truename of the ''tongue of flames''; from there, they were expected to balance both pursuits themselves. They generally operated from small organizations within their churches, rarely being there organizations of brimstone speakers operating on their own."
