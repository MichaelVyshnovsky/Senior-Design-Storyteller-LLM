        "mainbody": "gauntlet of Iyachtu Xvim was a specialty priest of the Church of Iyachtu Xvim. They were fanatics who bullied followers of others faiths, with special focus on those of Cyric.\nThese miscreants devoted all of the time and energy into spreading strife and hatred to those they encountered.\nGauntlets prided themselves on their assistance in Iyachtu Xvims rise in power, spreading hatred and tyranny among their gods rivals. Though homicidal and fanatical, the gauntlets were highly organized and disciplined and adhered to a strict hierarchy. Many were previously priests of Cyric who left the faith after Cyrics betrayal of Zhentil Keep.\nThese individuals could turn and command undead. They were immune to all forms of fear. Gauntlets could usually easily determine if someone was a Cyricist just by looking at them.\nGauntlets could not cast any beneficial spells from the healing sphere or necromantic sphere with the exception of cure light wounds.\nGauntlets wore black armor such as chainmail or plate mail. They favored black helmets and black cloaks and cowls with forest green trim. They could wield any weapon of their choice, but were required to carry one bladed weapon and one blunt weapon.\nGauntlets and followers of Cyric attacked each other on site with homicidal frenzy."
