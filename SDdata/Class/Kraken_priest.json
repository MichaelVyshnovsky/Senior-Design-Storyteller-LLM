        "mainbody": "'''Kraken priests''' were devout [[evil]] servitors of [[kraken]]s, who worshiped them like [[gods]] and were imbued by them with powers.",
        "Abilities": "When one became a kraken priest, their body underwent a minor physical transformation that reflected the influence of a kraken, though the nature of this varied for each priest. Features included eyes as black as [[ink]], a featureless face, a suckered tentacle for a tongue, eyes covering the body, or mouths covering the body that dribbled seawater. They also gained the ability to breathe water and swim with some expertise.\n\nIf on the same [[plane of existence]], a kraken could read the thoughts of its priest and even take control of their mind, using them as a mouthpiece for their own words. When this possession occurred, the physical manifestations of their reverence would intensify. Regardless of what languages the priest knew, the kraken spoke through them in either [[Abyssal]], [[Infernal]], or [[Primordial]]. And when they spoke it was thunderous, audible out to {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}}, and struck fear into creatures of the kraken's choice.\n\nKraken priests could innately cast a number of [[spell]]s, owing to the power imbued in them by krakens. At will they could cast ''[[command]]'' and ''[[create or destroy water]]''. Three times per day they could cast ''[[control water]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', and ''[[water walk]]''. And once per day they could cast ''[[call lightning]]'' and ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]''.",
        "History": "By the time of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the people of the [[Purple Rocks]] were dominated by the kraken [[Slarkrethel]] and his kraken priests, most of whom were natives of the islands.\n\nAlso around this time, the [[Thay]]an navy was ''en route'' to the city of [[Myth Nantar]] to [[Assault on Myth Nantar|assault]] it and among this fleet two ships were noted as having kraken priests among their crew.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Myth Nantar|15}}{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Myth Nantar|38}} One [[longship]] had a kraken priest as its captain, while one of the Thayan navy's [[death knight-dreadnaught]]s had a kraken priest as a quartermaster.\n\nAround the 1480s DR, two [[Thayan]] slave women, [[Fhenimore]] and [[Whymsee]], sought to avoid their planned execution and resurrection as [[undead]] servitors by escaping into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. While drifting on a destitute [[skiff]] they were come upon by a kraken, mortally wounded from an assault by [[adventurer]]s, and explained its plight to them through its telepathy. Before passing away, the kraken transformed both of them into kraken priests, investing them with the duty of protecting its sole young offspring. The two took to this new lease on life with great enthusiasm and spent the next ten years searching for a safe haven for the kraken.\n\nAround the 1490s DR, the two were approached by [[Gar Shatterkeel]],Although the adventure is not precisely dated, it is set \"a few years\" after the events of ''[[Princes of the Apocalypse]]'' (p. 2). who convinced them that the coral mountain [[Umberlee's Maw]] was a safe space for the kraken to be raised. In reality, Shatterkeel was planning to eventually kill both priests,<ref> then use the blood of their kraken to fuel a great [[necromantic]] ritual.",
