        "Culture": "Agriculture was the focus of a cultivator's life. They tended to think and speak in agricultural terms.",
        "Abilities": "A cultivator could impart a special blessing upon crops on a daily basis. This blessing increased the crop's yield by 150% but could only be used once per year on a specific crop.\n\nAny [[spell]]s cast from the [[plant sphere]] were twice as strong with regards to spell duration, range, area of effect, and the amount of physical harm they caused.\n\nCultivators could not turn [[undead]], nor could they cast spells from the [[guardian sphere]] or [[necromantic sphere]].",
        "Possessions": "Cultivators wore simple brown robes or clothing. Higher-ranking cultivators often wore belts adorned with [[gemstone]]s or threaded with [[gold]] or [[silver]]. Many cultivators wore a special green [[rose]] that did not wilt for a full year. These individuals preferred longer hair, with males always growing beards.\n\nA cultivator wielded a [[staff]] and wore [[leather armor]] during combat situations. They never wore metallic armor or carried [[shield]]s."
