        "In a paroxysm of fear, Diirinka stabbed his brother in the back and fled, leaving Diinkarazan's mind to be horribly consumed by [[Ilsensine|the tentacled one]], while his body was thrown into the [[Abyss]] where yet it lies.\n|An excerpt from ''[[Sigil]] and Beyond'', a sacred tome for aficionados of the [[Outer Planes]].\n}}": "=Description==",

        "Description": "Diirinka preferred to appear as a diminutive (around {{SI|3'6\"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall), stunted creature, a kind of derro-[[lich]] hybrid.",
        "Personality": "Diirinka was a mean-spirited, hateful, and despicable deity. He was a chaotic and treacherous individual (as well as a skilled improviser) with little care for anything and anyone and a willingness to betray them all to accomplish his goals. Notably this apathy extended to himself, perhaps because the ancient betrayal he dealt to his brother still gnawed at his soul.",
        "Powers": "Diirinka was a skilled wizard and capable priest capable of drawing [[spell]]s from whatever [[school of magic]] or [[sphere]] of divine influence he wanted. His [[avatar]] had all the special protections of a lich.",
        "Possessions": "Diirinka wore a magical robe which was in a state of constant change, always swirling gray, white, and black. He could draw up to five magical strands from it each day and when holding them in his hand could cast difficult to resist versions of ''[[slay living]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', and ''[[destruction]]'' by touch from white, gray, and black threads respectively. He also carried a ''+3'' [[dagger of venom]] and ''[[wand of cold]]'' and wore a ''[[ring of telekinesis]]'' and a ''[[brooch of shielding]]''.",
        "Realm": "Diirinka's realm, known as The Hidden Betrayal, was, appropriately enough, hidden away on the 3{{rd}} layer of [[Pandemonium]], [[Phlegethon]]. No one who had seen it ever returned to tell of it, though it was said to be chillingly dark and endlessly dripping with foul water.",
        "Activities": "Diirinka only sent avatars for his own benefit, usually either to obtain magic items or to amuse himself with acts of cruelty. If he chose to punish his servants it would either be out of whim or temper, and he never sent them omens (although he sometimes indirectly guided them to magical items or locations, albeit always on a perilous route).",
        "Relationships": "Diirinka and his twin brother were perhaps the least respected of the dwarven gods. Even the avaricious [[Abbathor]], despite being distrusted and disliked by the other members of the [[Morndinsamman]], was considered a member of the pantheon. Even the duergar gods [[Laduguer]] and [[Deep Duerra]] were at least considered members-in-exile, still acknowledged by the dwarves and with Laduguer's leave being debatably mutual. Diirinka and Diinkarazan were not just banished but completely disowned.<ref name=\"DD-47-48>\n\nThe most commonly given reason for the banishment of the twins by [[Moradin]] was that both were irredeemably evil, and while true, it was also possible that fear and jealousy of their magical powers played a part in the consensus. Diirinka was the most magical of all the dwarven deities, a notably distinctive trait as the pantheon had few cases of arcane or mystic gods.<ref>\n\nDiirinka and Diinkarazan were often considered the youngest of the pantheon's elder members. The twins were thought to be children of a dwarven god that was a [[lesser deity]] at the time of their conception, possibly even Moradin himself, although this was unclear.\n\nTo all but the derro, Diirinka was a wholly loathsome being. The [[duergar]] gods were also among his foes, and the duergar believed that he had cursed part of [[Hammergrim]] so that haunting spirits slowly drained the ruling chieftain until he was incapable of ruling without them (though they might have confused him with Diinkarazan).<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note2\"> The descriptions of Diirinka used match more closely to Diinkarazan, a mad god whose interference in the matter was debated due to being trapped in the Abyss. Other enemies of the Deep Lich included [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], patron of the [[deep gnome]]s, and [[Shevarash]], elven god of vengeance.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Derro": "While most of the derro worshiped Diirinka, there were very few actual [[cleric]]s in their wisdom-deficient ranks. Rather, than priests in the orthodox sense, the clergy of Diirinka was occupied by \"savants\" granted power by Diirinka in a wholly unusual way. Rather than granting them spells, Diirinka infused the derro with sorcery stemming from an unusual source for a god, that being his own magical nature. The race had a greater-than-normal tendency to develop sorcerous powers, and those who had them were considered specially blessed by the Great Savant, which was in fact true. Their innate magical skills were the result of Diirinka shaping their bodies and brains during gestation, his work on their forms allowing for such power.\n\nThe magic of derro savants was considerable,",
            "Dogma": "In reality, Diirinka was fairly indifferent to what his savants actually did or taught and sent them no signs, caring only that they revered him and helped the derro grow stronger. Savants took it upon themselves to guide their people and were the interpreters of Diirinka's teachings. They maintained order among their groups and forces and gave instruction as to the proper treatment of slaves (discipline through cruelty and fear), typically using spells to confuse and irritate rather than kill so as to enslave the defeated.\n\nSavants pursued magic and power, their key objectives including adventuring and crafting to acquire magical items (while local derro pantheons sometimes had a warrior demigod with a secondary influence in weapon-smithing, magical weapon manufacturing was indisputably Diirinka's domain). All were trained in some esoteric sphere of knowledge, usually the arcane, and some were known to experiment with fungal extracts and [[poison]]s to the end of functionally pacifying (and lobotomizing) their slaves.",
            "Temples": "The [[Hall of Sacred Spells]] was a known shrine of Diirinka within [[Gracklstugh]]."
        },
        "History": "Diirinka was once the patron deity of the Shanatar fiefdom of Torglor, the [[Silver]] Kingdom, located beneath the [[Snowflake Mountains]], a city with extensive connections between the upper and middle [[Underdark]] but few to the surface world. Befitting their patron, the dwarves of Torglor were renowned for their invention and [[magic#rune magic|rune magic]]. Like [[Korolnor]], the city of Diinkarazan's dominant faith, Torglor's forces skirmished with the thrall armies of the [[illithid]]s in [[Oryndoll]] long after the formal conclusion of the [[Mindstalker Wars]], and its artisans had developed many unusual weapons and tactics for besting the mind flayers, many of which were used into the future.<ref name=\"DDGU-85-86\" >\n\nAt some point, Diirinka and Diinkarazan, young gods at the time, sought to expand their dominion and create their own dwarven subrace, one made distinct by possessing qualities that other dwarves lacked, namely speed, dexterity, and skill in magic. The pair were drawn to deeper places than other dwarves, and in their exploration of the Underdark found a vast cavern glittering with raw, elemental magic. They began gathering the strange, alien artifacts scattered about a green, central crystal sphere floating just above the ground.\n\nAs they did however, a large, spectral brain floated up from the sphere, surveying them coldly. Somehow, they had stumbled upon the realm of Ilsensine, and it had not taken kindly to their intrusion. Before the illithid god could punish the diminutive dwarves stealing its secrets, Diirinka backstabbed his brother, leaving him to suffer Ilsensine's wrath. Diinkarazan would be made to suffer in the Abyss, his existence forgotten by nearly all but the illithids; he was shunned in derro lore as taught by the shamans and so Diirinka's twin was known by few derro, and when he was it was in the context of getting betrayed, and Diirinka was still the one to emulate.\n\nAfter this mythic event, Diirinka would return to his own lands with some of Ilsensine's secrets he managed to escape with, and begin meddling with the magic he had stolen. He hid himself from the other dwarven deities and spent centuries experimenting on dwarves, and in the gruesome process left whole races of mindless, deformed, dwarf-like abominations shambling in isolated cave complexes when he disposed of them. He would twist his former dwarf followers until he perfected the derro, warping them into the hateful race they would be for ages after, his creations reaching their ultimate form in the savants.\n\nGiven that the derro were a race of mad fanatics, the origin stories they told themselves varied in accuracy, though grains of truth were nonetheless present. In orthodox derro mythology for example, Diirinka created them purely using his own skill, which was certainly false, Depending on what foe Diirinka's savants wanted to polarize the community against, Ilsensine, or even the mind flayers in general, weren't always the antagonists. The only common factor was that Diirinka betrayed his brother to escape with magical power stolen by a great evil force.\n\nExactly what happened past this point was another point of contention in derro lore. In some myths the dwarf gods drove the derro away due to their jealousy of Diirinka's creations and own prowess, while in others he preemptively hid them in the Underdark to avoid an envy-rooted uprising. In actuality it was the former, good dwarves driving the derro to the depths of the Underdark whilst the dwarf gods banished Diirinka.\n\nAs for Diirinka's dwarven legacy, Torglor's ruins had long been abandoned, though those who battled Oryndoll's denizens still sometimes returned in the hopes of finding new ways to defeat illithids. The Torglor Scepter meanwhile, marked with his spiral symbol,  never left scholarly hands, having been the property of the [[Halruaa]]n noble family of [[Ryscelsar]] for centuries."
