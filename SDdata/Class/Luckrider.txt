'''Luckriders''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Tymora]] who observed games of chance to ensure that no one cheated.<ref name="WaPotR-p117" >

==Activities==
Luckriders were very familiar with all games typically used to gamble for coin. They often participated in the games as well, though they remained constantly aware if anyone was cheating.

==Culture==
Luckriders used chance in their daily lives even more so than the [[favored]].

==Abilities==
They were extremely skilled at detecting if someone around them was trying to cheat. They would lose access to all of their [[spell]]s for a full day if they ever cheated during a game of chance.

==Possessions==
They wore simple black [[robe]]s with their [[holy symbol]] worn on a chain around their neck.
