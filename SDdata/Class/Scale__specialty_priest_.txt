Scales were specialty priests of the Church of Tyr who served justice by acting as judges and arbiters among disputes they came across during their travels, especially in regions without a formal court system or legal authorities.
Scales traveled around, representing Tyr and justice as judges in the communities they visited.
Scales were stern individuals fully devoted to their cause. They ignored the concept of mercy, being fully focused on pure justice. All scales were human. They usually made many enemies as they moved around.
A scale could detect a lie three times per day. If wearing a ring of truth a scale could force someone to answer a single question truthfully.
Any scale uttering a lie would be struck dumb until another priest of Tyr cast remove curse upon them.
They wore either chainmail or plate mail beneath their white robes of office. They wielded warhammers which also served to represent Tyrs presence in a courtroom. Scales also used a shining closed-face helmet that effectively rendered them blind. They wore this while hearing arguments in order to focus only on the details of each case.
