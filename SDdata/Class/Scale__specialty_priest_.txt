'''Scales''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Tyr]] who served justice by acting as judges and arbiters among disputes they came across during their travels, especially in regions without a formal court system or legal authorities.<ref name="WaPotR-p119" >

==Activities==
Scales traveled around, representing [[Tyr]] and justice as judges in the communities they visited.

==Culture==
Scales were stern individuals fully devoted to their cause. They ignored the concept of mercy, being fully focused on pure justice. All scales were [[human]]. They usually made many enemies as they moved around.

==Abilities==
A scale could ''[[Discern lies|detect a lie]]'' three times per day. If wearing a ''[[ring of truth]]'' a scale could force someone to answer a single question truthfully.

Any scale uttering a lie would be struck dumb until another priest of Tyr cast ''[[remove curse]]'' upon them.

==Possessions==
They wore either [[chainmail]] or [[plate mail]] beneath their white robes of office. They wielded [[warhammer]]s which also served to represent Tyr's presence in a courtroom. Scales also used a shining closed-face [[helmet]] that effectively rendered them blind. They wore this while hearing arguments in order to focus only on the details of each case.
