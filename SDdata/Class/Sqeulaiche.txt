'''Sqeulaiche''' ({{Pronounce|skell|lie|refs= was the [[leprechaun]] [[demigod]] of trickery and illusions.The in-universe language for this translation is not given in the source; however, it appears to be a [[wikipedia:Celtic language|Celtic]] word. In the Forgotten Realms, this would most likely place it in one of the [[Waelan]] languages, such as [[Druidic language|Druidic]]. and a member of the Faerie Queen's Inner Circle. it was unknown if he was directly worshiped on [[Toril]].

==Description==
Sqeulaiche's [[avatar]] was a comely male leprechaun who wore a pointed red hat and a fine silk coat.

==Personality==
Ever playful and unpredictable, Sqeulaiche was a trickster and a prankster who enjoyed teasing his friends—and even Queen Titania! He loved to mock [[lawful]] creatures and annoy [[evil]] ones. He was generally [[chaotic neutral]] in outlook but leaned more towards good than evil.

}}
Sqeulaiche, however, was not stupid, nor was he all fun and games. He loved the [[fey|faerie folk]] and would not permit them to be harassed by more powerful beings.

Sqeulaiche, like many leprechauns, had a weakness for wine and gold, and it was not overly difficult to bribe him for information or favors.

==Powers==
Sqeulaiche could always remain [[greater invisibility|invisible]] if he desired. His avatar shared a number of innate magical powers in common with the other sylvan gods. He was also immune to all [[enchantment]]s and [[charm]]s and to all illusions.

He employed [[spell]]s but only from the school of [[illusion]]. He also had a number of innate magical powers. His avatar could always [[polymorph any object]], create a powerfully convincing [[silent image]], and deploy [[ventriloquism]], as could most leprechauns. Additionally, he had greater powers to create [[Chaos (spell)|chaos]] in foes, to [[Leomund's lamentable belaborment|force them into irrelevant discussions with each other]], or to throw them into [[Tasha's hideous laughter|fits of uncontrollable laughter]].

==Possessions==
Sqeulaiche's avatar fought with a tiny magical [[dagger]].

==Divine Realm==
Sqeulaiche shared the [[divine realm]] of the Inner Circle of the Seelie Court, which had no permanent location but instead wandered from plane to plane, from the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] to [[Arborea]] to [[Ysgard]].

==Activities==
Titania sometimes used her magic to send one of Sqeulaiche's avatars on missions throughout the [[planes of existence]].

==Relationships==
Sqeulaiche was considered a member of the Inner Circle of the Seelie Court, serving Titania and [[Oberon]] along with [[Damh]] and [[Verenestra]], their children, and with [[Eachthighern]], the Lord of [[unicorn]]s and [[pegasi]].

The Court Jester was good friends with [[Erevan Ilesere]] of the elves and [[Nathair Sgiathach]], god of [[pseudodragon]]s.

==Worshipers==
Sqeulaiche was patron of the leprechauns, but, like other sylvan gods, he did not grant spells to his followers, nor did he have priests or [[cleric]]s, for all fey creatures had magical powers of their own. His [[holy symbol]]s were both a [[clover]] leaf and a pointed red hat like the one that he wore.

He was not directly worshiped in the Realms; however, the [[elves]] of [[Faerûn]] might have offered prayers to him along with their worship of the [[Seldarine]], as they also did to other deities of the fey people.

==History==
The myths claimed that Sqeulaiche sprouted live from a magical plant in Arvandor, a spiritual off-shoot of the natural world itself.
