'''Berefts''' were wielders of [[truespeak]] who sought to wield and safeguard the power of the ''Word of Unmaking'', a single word that held the power to unravel all of creation.

==Abilities==
It was necessary to use a spell, the ''[[ritual of renaming]]'', on a prospective bereft; the bereft's new name was always made as obscure as possible. Discovering a bereft's personal truename was an inordinate challenge.

Syllable by syllable, berefts slowly assembled the ''Word of Unmaking''; a bereft that had just started would only know the first syllable, the ''syllable of detachment'', which made the target of its utterance deeply maladroit. The second syllable came next; this, the ''syllable of affliction'', temporarily erased one of the target's senses. The third syllable, the ''syllable of exile'', allowed them to evict their target from reality for a few seconds; the fourth syllable, when mastered, let them partly unmake and tear the body of one target, dealing severe damage. The final syllable, on its own, dealt the sort of lifeforce drain often seen dealt by powerful [[undead]].

By speaking all the syllables together, a bereft who had mastered them all could speak a ''word of unmaking''. Aimed at a dead person within range, it made the subject impossible to raise or resurrect in its present state. It required a ''ritual of renaming'', like the one the bereft had gone through, to make them once more possible to raise, and even then only a ''[[true resurrection]]'' would work anymore.

==Relationships==
Berefts went as far as erasing their own [[true name]] to stay obscure, and obscure indeed they were; even among truenamers bereft were at the far fringe. It was not unthinkable for berefts to erase even their own names from their own mind, as well as that of all who ever knew them, and strike them from no end of records, using magic if necessary. The few who knew what they were in spite of the lengths to which they went to erase all knowledge of themselves, tended to be unfriendly somewhat.

The bereft were commonly of the Church of [[Shar]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Truenamers}}
