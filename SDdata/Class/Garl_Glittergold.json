        "mainbody": "Garl Glittergold (), also known as The Watchful Protector, was a lawful good greater deity of gnomes. Garl led the Lords of the Golden Hills as the deity of luck, protection and trickery.\nAside from the other non-evil members of the gnomish pantheon, Garl was allied with Yondalla, Corellon Larethian and Moradin. His main companion was his intelligent battleaxe, Arumdina the Justifier.\nGarls tendency to jest with the various deities worshiped by the creatures and monsters of the Underdark resulted in him garnering many enemies, but chief among them was the kobold god, Kurtulmak.\nGarl was the most popular of the gnomish deities, and honored, in one way or another, by nearly all gnomes. His clerics, known as Glitterbrights, wore war helms and gold belts. \nOn the 13 day of each month, the Forgotten Folk held the Communion of Laughter in his honor. It consisted of joke-telling contests, communal meals, dancing, prayers, and storytelling, and donations of gold, which Garls church used to the benefit of the entire community.\nAccording to legend, Garl Glittergold was exploring underground when he found a new cavern, and inside, a new peopleâ€”the gnomes. He told them a joke and then led them out into the wider world.\nAccording to legend, Garl let himself be captured by Kurtulmak, only to escape and cause the entire roof of Kurtulmaks cavern to fall on his head.\nMain article CategoryTemples to Garl Glittergold"
