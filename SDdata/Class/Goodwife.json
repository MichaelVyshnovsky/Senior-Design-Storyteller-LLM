        "mainbody": "oodwives were specialty priestesses devoted to Nephthys, the Guardian of Wealth and Commerce within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThey tithed heavily to the Chuch of Nephthys, giving three quarters of all of their wealth to the church. In exchange for this the church took care of all of the funeral arrangements for members of the goodwifes family.\nGoodwives were always human females of Mulhorandi descent who were either married or widowed. Goodwives despised Red Wizards from Thay.\nThey could effectively calculate the value of an object simply by viewing it. They could cast invisibility to undead, protection from evil, negative plane protection, transmute metal to wood, holy word, and fire storm once per day. A glyph of warding could be cast three times per tenday. They were adept at casting spells from the wards sphere, enjoying faster casting times and extended duration on such spells. Goodwives never lost in a game of chance.\nGoodwives commonly carried a blunt weapon or perhaps a net or lasso. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they could wear."
