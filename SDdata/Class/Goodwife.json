        "mainbody": "'''Goodwives''' were [[specialty priestess]]es devoted to [[Nephthys]], the Guardian of Wealth and Commerce within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].",
        "Activities": "They tithed heavily to the [[Chuch of Nephthys]], giving three quarters of all of their wealth to the church. In exchange for this the church took care of all of the funeral arrangements for members of the goodwife's family.",
        "Culture": "Goodwives were always [[human]] females of [[Mulhorandi]] descent who were either married or widowed. Goodwives despised [[Red Wizard]]s from [[Thay]].",
        "Abilities": "They could effectively calculate the value of an object simply by viewing it. They could cast ''[[invisibility to undead]]'', ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[negative plane protection]]'', ''[[transmute metal to wood]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', and ''[[fire storm]]'' once per day. A ''[[glyph of warding]]'' could be cast three times per tenday. They were adept at casting spells from the [[wards sphere]], enjoying faster casting times and extended duration on such spells. Goodwives never lost in a game of chance.",
        "Possessions": "Goodwives commonly carried a blunt weapon or perhaps a [[net]] or [[lasso]]. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they could wear."
