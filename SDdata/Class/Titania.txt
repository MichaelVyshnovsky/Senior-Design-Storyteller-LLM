Titania (also known as Tiandra
Titania appeared as an eladrin of immense beauty. Her skin was the color of honey and her hair shimmered in all of the colors of autumn leaves. Her eyes glowed with gold like the sun.
Alternatively, her avatar would appear as a small but beautiful gossamer-winged fairie with flawless, pale skin and immaculate cheekbones and gray-blue eyes.
Titania was hard to classify personality-wise. She seemed flighty and frivolous to some, but in truth she was a brilliant strategist both in court and on a battlefield. She had a dry sense of humor and could be very pragmatic when needed. It was almost impossible to make her angry, but if a truly despicable act roused her ire, the perpetrator would be faced with the most powerful wrath!
Titania was amused by mortals and had been known to take some as lovers.
Titanias very smile could cause crops to ripen, and her frown could trigger wildfires. Her gaze could cause mortals to go mad.
Titanias avatar shared a number of innate magical powers in common with the other sylvan gods. Her avatar was immune to paralysis, all illusions and mind-affecting magics, and symbols and power words and could only be harmed by enchanted weapons. She was able to immediately recognize pure water, all animals and plants, and poisons. She had great charming powers, including the ability to place a geas on any creature to never enter sylvan lands. Titania could summon woodland creatures or swarms of critters to her aid. With a simple wave of her hand, she could entangle foes with any nearby vegetation.
Titania always carried a diamond-tipped wand, and her avatar fought with a magic dagger. Compared to her innate powers, the dagger was mostly decorative, but the wand was a staff of power that glowed as a gem of brilliance and surrounded her with a magic circle against evil. The wand could also create food and water or a feast fit for heroes. It could also purify food and drink.
The Seelie Court was also the name of Titanias realm. It had no permanent location but instead wandered from plane to plane, from the Beastlands to Arborea to Ysgard.
The realm was one of the most beautiful places in existence, and time flowed differently there.
Titanias palace was Senaliesse, where she held her Summer Court. Her throne room was overflowing with flowers, water fountains, and fine silks, and faeries flitted all about. Mortal bards and playwrights often performed for her.
Titanias throne was ornately carved from ice in the shape of a dragon. (It was a mirror of the Queen of Air and Darknesss throne, except that that one was made of darkness and shadow.) The throne was in fact a magical construct that could serve as a guardian if needed.
Titania watched over all fey beings, be they dryads, pixies, satyrs, treants, unicorns, or any of the other nearly countless varieties, desiring that all such creatures could someday live in utter joy.
When the Seelie Court met, Titanias avatar was always present and almost always accompanied by at least one other member of the Inner Circle of the Court. All faeries knew when and where the Court would be meeting.
If harm ever came to faerie lands, Titania would not hesitate to send her avatar to intervene.
Titania had a famous love affair with Oberon, the Green Lord, and it was he who built her palace. Some even called the couple husband and wife, while admitting that both took other lovers freely. At other times, they were also great enemies at still other times, they were both lover and foe at the same time.
Damh, the god of satyrs and korreds, was seen as Titania and Oberons son. Verenestra, the goddess of dryads, was considered Titanias daughter. The Prince of Frost was also a son of Titania.
The so-called "Inner Circle" of sylvan gods respected Titania as their queen and deferred to her in matters of judgment. Skerrit, god of centaurs, and other "Outer Circle" gods did not follow Titanias rule, but she had great love for them and their worshipers nonetheless.
The Seldarine were on good terms with Queen Titania and were willing to aid her whenever she requested it of them.
The Queen of Air and Darkness was rumored to be the dark sister of Titania. Whatever the truth, Titania refused to wage open war against the evil queen and instead grieved for her.
Noble eladrin infused with the power of summer served as her barons.
Titanias niece, Lady Shandria, governed Astrazalian, the City of Starlight in the Feywild.
Titania was worshiped by a plethora of non-evil fey beings. Brownies, bookas, pixies, and sprites considered her their patron deity. Titania, like other sylvan gods, did not grant spells to her followers, nor did she have priests or clerics, for all fey creatures had magical powers of their own.
Titanias followers taught that she was a goddess of goodness and mercy. They saw her as a mother figure. Her holy symbol was a white diamond with a blue star.
Periodically, Titania hosted a parliament of all the separate fey courts—seelie and unseelie—at Senaliesse, which was sometimes called the Court of Stars.
Titania was a patron to many warlocks in the Realms.
