'''Aetharnor''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Abbathor]], the Great Master of Greed.

==Culture==
The vast majority of aetharnor were either [[gold dwarves]] or [[shield dwarves]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, to include both males and females, could become an aetharnar.

==Abilities==
Aetharnor were usually skilled miners with an eye for appraising the value of [[gemstone]]s and precious metals. They were proficient in the use of [[thieves' cant]] as a form of communication.

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, aetharnor could cast ''[[detect metals and minerals]]'', ''[[maskstone]]'', ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'', ''[[conceal riches]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[Von Gasik's refusal]]'', ''[[steal enchantment]]'', and ''[[Gunther's kaleidoscopic strike]]'' on a daily basis. Furthermore, they could cast ''[[glorious transmutation]]'' once per month provided they owned a ''[[philosopher's stone]]''. When concentrating, an aetharnar could ''[[detect illusion]]s'' within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in front of them.

==Possessions==
Aetharnor wielded a variety of weapons including [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s, [[hand crossbow]]s, [[knives]], [[lasso]]s, [[shortbow]]s, [[sling]]s, [[longsword]]s, [[broadsword]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[staves]]. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
