Xothor were specialty priests devoted to Dugmaren Brightmantle, the Wandering Tinker.
The vast majority of xothor were shield dwarves or gold dwarves, but members of all of the dwarf races, both males and females, could become a xothar.
Xothor were usually fluent in several languages, including some ancient ones, and excelled at learning new ones.
In addition to their normal spells, xothor could cast mending, brightmantle, augury, idea, Alamirs fundamental breakdown, tongues, divination, commune, magic missile, legend lore, and teleport without error on a daily basis. They could use magical scrolls usually reserved for wizards or clerics containing spells beyond their casting ability, though a xothars use of such scrolls sometimes produced undesirable effects.
Xothor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield. Chainmail was the heaviest form of armor that they wore and did not carry a shield.
