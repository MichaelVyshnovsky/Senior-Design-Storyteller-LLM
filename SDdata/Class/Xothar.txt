'''Xothor''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], the Wandering Tinker.

==Culture==
The vast majority of xothor were [[shield dwarves]] or [[gold dwarves]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, both males and females, could become a xothar.

==Abilities==
Xothor were usually fluent in several languages, including some ancient ones, and excelled at learning new ones.

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, xothor could cast ''[[mending]]'', ''[[brightmantle]]'', ''[[augury]]'', ''[[idea]]'', ''[[Alamir's fundamental breakdown]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[Divination (spell)|divination]]'', ''[[commune]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]'' on a daily basis. They could use [[magic]]al [[scroll]]s usually reserved for [[wizard]]s or [[cleric]]s containing [[spell]]s beyond their casting ability, though a xothar's use of such scrolls sometimes produced undesirable effects.

==Possessions==
Xothor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield. [[Chainmail]] was the heaviest form of [[armor]] that they wore and did not carry a [[shield]].
