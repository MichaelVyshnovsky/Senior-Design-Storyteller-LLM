        "mainbody": "Herne the Huntmaster, or Herne Hurkgruum in Orcish, also known as the Wild Hunter, was a deity of hunting worshiped by the orcs of the High Forest, instead of the orc pantheon. He was also the herald of Cerunnos when that god needed to intervene in mortal affairs, in which capacity he was known as as Herne the Hunter.\nAs Herne the Hunter, he rode a nightmare and wore a black skull mask and a crown of antlers.\nA long time before Corellons battle with Gruumsh, an incarnation or avatar of Herne came to the world of Toril and was slain by the native deity Malar. Years later, when a young Araushnee went looking to recruit Malar she found and gazed upon the shadowy remains of Herne.\nAround the time of the rise of Netheril, a wave of planar immigrants came from another worldFaiths & Avatars does not state that Herne is a newer incarnation, only a newly arrived deity, but due to him being shown in Evermeet Island of Elves as having died thousands of years prior to the time of Netheril, this seems the only logical explanation.\nThis Herne was worshiped by orc tribes in northwest Faerûns High Forest, including the Bloody Eye, Horned Lord, Sharpspike, and Tanglethorn tribes by the mid–14 century DR.\nEventually, during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Herne was challenged and defeated once more in battle by Malar, who then proceeded to assume his portfolio and identity.\nNevertheless, the High Forest orcs faith in Herne Hurkgruum would remain strong. During the Gray Migrations out of the High Forest in 1372 DR, they took it with them through the Delimbiyr Vale and Graypeak Mountains.\nHerne was said to wield a spear called \"Boarskewer\".\nHis symbol to the High Forest orcs was a single antler, usually drawn as a stylized pictograph.\nNotably, Herne the Huntmaster was revered by the High Forest orcs, instead of the typical orc pantheon. His priests were almost entirely adepts and druids, as well as a few clerics."
