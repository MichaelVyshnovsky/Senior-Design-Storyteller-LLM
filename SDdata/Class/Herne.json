He was also the herald of [[Cerunnos]] when that god needed to intervene in mortal affairs, in which capacity he was known as as '''Herne the Hunter'''.",
        "Description": "As Herne the Hunter, he rode a [[Nightmare (creature)|nightmare]] and wore a black skull mask and a crown of antlers.",
        "History": "A long time before [[Corellon]]'s battle with [[Gruumsh]], an incarnation or [[avatar]] of Herne came to the world of [[Toril]] and was slain by the native deity [[Malar]]. Years later, when a young [[Araushnee]] went looking to recruit Malar she found and gazed upon the shadowy remains of Herne.<ref>\n\nAround the time of the rise of [[Netheril]], a wave of planar immigrants came from [[Earth|another world]]''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' does not state that Herne is a newer incarnation, only a newly arrived deity, but due to him being shown in ''[[Evermeet: Island of Elves]]'' as having died thousands of years prior to the time of Netheril, this seems the only logical explanation.\n\nThis Herne was worshiped by [[orc]] tribes in [[northwest Faerûn]]'s High Forest, including the [[Bloody Eye]], [[Horned Lord tribe|Horned Lord]], [[Sharpspike]], and [[Tanglethorn]] tribes by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nEventually, during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Herne was challenged and defeated once more in battle by Malar, who then proceeded to assume his portfolio and identity.\n\nNevertheless, the [[High Forest orc]]s' faith in Herne Hurkgruum would remain strong. During the [[Gray Migrations]] out of the High Forest in [[1372 DR]], they took it with them through the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] and [[Graypeak Mountains]].",
        "Possessions": "Herne was said to wield a [[spear]] called \"Boarskewer\".",
        "Holy Symbol": "His symbol to the High Forest orcs was a single antler, usually drawn as a stylized pictograph.",
        "Worshipers": "Notably, Herne the Huntmaster was revered by the High Forest orcs, instead of the typical [[orc pantheon]]. His priests were almost entirely [[adept]]s and [[druid]]s, as well as a few [[cleric]]s."
