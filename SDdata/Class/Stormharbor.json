        "mainbody": "Stormharbors were specialty priests of the Church of Valkur who interceded on the behalf of sailors with the Captain of the Waves who tended to be unpredictable.\nStormharbors attempted to grow the strength of the church by attracting more followers by showing that Valkur could be counted upon to protect them against the wrath of both Talos and Umberlee while at sea. Valkur, however, did not always cooperate.\nStormharbors tried to best represent their god by maintaining poise and resisting the urge to anger quickly. They were reliable and patient individuals.\nA stormharbor could determine if inclement weather was natural or caused by a servant of Talos or Umberlee. Since dolphins were sometimes a symbol of Valkur, all stormharbors could speak with dolphins at will. They could also summon a group of 1â€“4 dolphins provided the creatures occurred naturally in the body of water. A stormharbor could also shapechange into a dolphin twice per day. The change to dolphin form actually healed the stormharbor of minor injuries.\nThey could not turn undead. Given Valkurs fickle nature, there was a slight chance he would not grant a spell that the stormharbor prayed for.\nThey wore tunics of shimmering blue that signified calm waters. They also wore white clerical stoles embroidered with gold dolphins, anchors, and sea birds for good luck. Stormharbors never wore armor. Their favored weapons were clubs, daggers, cutlasses, tridents, or quarterstaffs."
