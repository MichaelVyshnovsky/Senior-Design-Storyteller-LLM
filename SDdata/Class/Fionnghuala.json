        "mainbody": "Fionnghuala (Pronounce|fin|ell|ah|refs=The in-universe language for this translation is not given in the source however, in the real world, Fionnghuala was a common Irish name in older times. In the Forgotten Realms, this would most likely place it in one of the Waelan languages, such as Druidic.\nAs a mortal, Fionnghuala was a small, petite human woman with red hair and green eyes.\nFionnghualas armor was gossamer, and she wore white feathers on her shoulders and as a crown. \nFionnghuala was brave, selfless, and virtuous. She was devoted to the cause of the Seelie Court and to that of the sorority of swanmays and was always ready to defend the faerie folk, killing to defend them if need be.\nFionnghuala was nigh impossible to surprise. She was immune to paralysis and petrification. No avian creature would ever harm her.\nFionnghuala had the fey powers to send a whispered message on the wind and could convince any small animals to deliver messages for her as well.\nHer most notable ability, as a swanmay, was being able to turn into a giant swan. She had the ability to turn anyone else into a swan also.\nShe bore a magical white feather, a gift from Titania and the source of her fey powers. Her weapons were a magical longsword that could heal her daily and a magical longbow with a quiver of flight arrows.\nFionnghuala shared the same divine realm as other members of the Seelie Court, which had no permanent location but instead wandered from plane to plane, from the Beastlands to Arborea to Ysgard.\nTitania sometimes used her magic to send one of Fionnghualas avatars on missions throughout the planes of existence. She often visited the meetings of the sisterhood of swanmays, and she patrolled the borders of faerie lands seeking out evil to stop.\nBecause her interests kept her away from sylvan realms more than other fey deities, Fionnghuala was considered a member of Titania and Oberons Outer Circle. She was very close friends with the giant goddess Iallanis.\nFionnghuala was one of the few persons the unicorn god Eachthighern allowed to ride him. More commonly, however, she simply flew alongside him in her swan form.\nShe was counted as one of Aerdrie Faenyas allies, as well as that of Solonor Thelandira and Baervan Wildwanderer.\nFionnghuala was the patron of swanmays, and they all revered her, but most had allegiances to other gods as well. Her followers believed in the power of communication and sorority and were always good. Like other sylvan gods, she did not grant spells to her followers, nor did she have priests or clerics, for all fey creatures had magical powers of their own. Her holy symbol was a white feather.\nFionnghuala was once a mortal woman with a great love of the fey people. She sacrificed her life to defend the fey during the most recent great war between the Queen of Air and Darknesss forces and the Seelie Court, taking a last stand to defend Oberons sorely wounded avatar.\nIn reward for her selfless bravery and sacrifice, Oberon raised her from the dead and made her a demigod, while Titania offered her the magic white feather that transformed her into a part-fey being and made her into the very first swanmay. Throughout the centuries, similar shared feathers have continued to transform noble female druids and rangers into members of the swanmay sorority."
