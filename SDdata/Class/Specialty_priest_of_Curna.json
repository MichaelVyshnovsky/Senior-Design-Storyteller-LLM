        "mainbody": "Specialty priests of Curna were worshipers of Curna, known elsewhere as Oghma, within Durpar in the Shining Lands.\nThey were often employed by wealthy merchants, providing consultation to their benefactors whenever possible.\nThese specialty priests could turn undead like normal priests. They ability to identify magic items by sight became more adept as their skills developed. They could summon a blinding flash of light from their holy symbol once per day. The light would affect a single selected target and blind them until it was either magically dispelled or the priest removed the blindess by will.\nThey were permitted to only wield blunt weapons. Any armor worn could not be metallic."
