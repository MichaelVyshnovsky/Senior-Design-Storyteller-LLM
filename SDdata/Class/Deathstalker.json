        "Culture": "In order to become initiated as a deathstalker, one must have fulfilled a set of strict requirements. First of all, the [[cleric]] must have Bhaal as their [[deity]] and be adept in hiding, moving silently, and surviving in difficult scenarios. The potential deathstalker must also be able to quick draw their weapon and have proof of murdering at least sixteen different sentient lifeforms, in sixteen different ways. The cleric must also be able to cast spells at a certain level of difficulty, and be attuned to either the [[Death domain|Death]] or [[Destruction domain]]s.\n\n{{fq\n|width=210px\n|text=Bhaal awaits thee,<br/>Bhaal embraces thee,<br/>none escape Bhaal.\n|source=Chant of a deathstalker}}\nOnce initiated, the deathstalker must adhere to the law of Bhaal.

        "Abilities": "Although it was unknown where the powers of a deathstalker came from, some suspected the influence of [[Set]] encroaching on the portfolio of [[Cyric]], while others believed that they came from Cyric himself. Some believed it was due to the rise of the [[Bhaalspawn]] or even their dead god, Bhaal.\n\nThose who chose Bhaal's dark path would have the ability to fade into the shadows and sneak with extreme care. Deathstalkers, if they studied their victims carefully enough, could, during a sneak attack, paralyze or even kill them. They could also direct the hatred of a living creature within 30 feet (9 meters) onto another creature. This mind-affecting method could lead potential enemies to distract each other, or even thin their own numbers, before a deathstalker struck.\n\nIt was said that the last gasp of Bhaal would resurrect a loyal deathstalker, if dying in service to the dead god himself.",
