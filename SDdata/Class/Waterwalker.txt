Waterwalkers were specialty priests devoted to Istishia, the Water Lord.
These individuals were always aquatic elves, half-elves of aquatic descent, sirines, merfolk, tritons, locathahs, reef giants, or selkies. Waterwalkers of aquatic elf heritage were usually looked upon with disdain by members of their own race.
They were unable to use any magic items related to fire such as a potion of fire breath or a wand of fire. Most waterwalkers could speak at least one language of one of the intelligent aquatic races.
In addition to their divine magic, waterwalkers could cast any wizard spell related to elemental water. They were more resistant to all forms of attack related to water, cold and acid. Their armor did not encumber them in the slightest while in water, and they also enjoyed the benefits of a ring of free action while in water. They could breathe under water and walk on water at will. They could use a variety of special abilities on a daily basis including summoning a water elemental, casting Melfs acid arrow, watery double, ice storm, wall of ice, acid storm, and Otilukes freezing sphere. They could eventually summon stronger water elementals but only once per tenday. Especially powerful waterwalkers could travel through the Elemental Plane of Water without the need for any kind of sustenance. Finally, waterwalkers could work together to cooperatively summon an immense water elemental to do their bidding.
Waterwalkers wielded blunt weapons and also used nets, harpoons, and tridents. The heaviest armor they wore was chainmail and some carried a shield.
