'''Waterwalkers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Istishia]], the Water Lord.

==Culture==
These individuals were always [[aquatic elves]], [[half-elves]] of aquatic descent, [[sirine]]s, [[merfolk]], [[triton]]s, [[locathah]]s, [[reef giant]]s, or [[selkie]]s. Waterwalkers of aquatic elf heritage were usually looked upon with disdain by members of their own race.

==Abilities==
They were unable to use any [[magic item]]s related to fire such as a ''[[potion of fire breath]]'' or a ''[[wand of fire]]''. Most waterwalkers could speak at least one language of one of the intelligent aquatic races.

In addition to their [[divine magic]], waterwalkers could cast any [[wizard]] [[spell]] related to [[elemental water]]. They were more resistant to all forms of attack related to water, cold and acid. Their [[armor]] did not encumber them in the slightest while in water, and they also enjoyed the benefits of a ''[[ring of free action]]'' while in water. They could breathe under water and walk on water at will. They could use a variety of special abilities on a daily basis including summoning a [[water elemental]], casting ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', ''[[watery double]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[wall of ice]]'', ''[[acid storm]]'', and ''[[Otiluke's freezing sphere]]''. They could eventually summon stronger water elementals but only once per tenday. Especially powerful waterwalkers could travel through the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] without the need for any kind of sustenance. Finally, waterwalkers could work together to cooperatively summon an immense water elemental to do their bidding.

==Possessions==
Waterwalkers wielded blunt weapons and also used [[net]]s, [[harpoon]]s, and [[trident]]s. The heaviest armor they wore was [[chainmail]] and some carried a [[shield]].
