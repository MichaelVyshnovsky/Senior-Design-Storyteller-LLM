        "mainbody": "yrmkeepers were specialty priests devoted to Tiamat, the Dragon Queen within the Untheric pantheon.\nThese individuals hoarded wealth for Tiamat and helped spread strife through the Old Empires.\nWyrmkeepers used to only be humans of Untheric lineage, but following the Time of Troubles any human could become a wyrmkeeper.\nWyrmkeepers were fluent in at least one of the chromatic dragon tongues. They possessed a number of magical abilites that could be used once per day including cause fear, feather fall, fear, fly, dragon scales, and they could breathe fire as if they had consumed a potion of fire breath. Once their skills developed to a certain degree they became completely immune to all forms of normal and magical harm of a single type of their choosing. Examples included fire, cold, acid, poison, or lightning. Particularly powerful wyrmkeepers were able to summon a faithful dragon to serve as their personal mount. The type of dragon that Tiamat sent to answer this summons was usually the most common breed associated with the region.\nIn addition to any blunt weapons, a wyrmkeeper sometimes carried a longsword. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear."
