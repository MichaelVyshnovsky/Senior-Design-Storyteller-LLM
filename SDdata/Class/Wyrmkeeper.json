        "mainbody": "'''Wyrmkeepers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Tiamat]], the Dragon Queen within the [[Untheric pantheon]].",
        "Activities": "These individuals hoarded wealth for Tiamat and helped spread strife through the [[Old Empires]].",
        "Culture": "Wyrmkeepers used to only be [[human]]s of [[Untheric]] lineage, but following the [[Time of Troubles]] any human could become a wyrmkeeper.",
        "Abilities": "Wyrmkeepers were fluent in at least one of the [[chromatic dragon]] tongues. They possessed a number of magical abilites that could be used once per day including ''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[Dragon scales (Tiamatan spell)|dragon scales]]'', and they could breathe fire as if they had consumed a ''[[potion of fire breath]]''. Once their skills developed to a certain degree they became completely immune to all forms of normal and magical harm of a single type of their choosing. Examples included fire, cold, acid, poison, or lightning. Particularly powerful wyrmkeepers were able to summon a faithful [[dragon]] to serve as their personal mount. The type of dragon that Tiamat sent to answer this summons was usually the most common breed associated with the region.",
        "Possessions": "In addition to any blunt weapons, a wyrmkeeper sometimes carried a [[longsword]]. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear."
