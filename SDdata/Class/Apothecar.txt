'''Apothecars''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Mystra]] whose primary duty was the identification of [[potion]]s, salves, ointments, and elixirs.<ref name="WaPotR-p97" >

==Activities==
An apothecar's extended exposure to bizarre chemicals and substances often made them look strange and disheveled, sometimes even with apparent burn marks or stains upon their skin. Most were also rather eccentric due to prolonged inhalation of fumes.

==Culture==
All apothecars were either [[human]]s, [[gnome]]s, or [[half-elves]]. They were a proud group of priests who often served [[Mystra]] for generations.

==Abilities==
Skilled apothecars could usually identify a substance just by smell or taste.

Given the amount of time spent researching potions and similar substances, apothecars dedicated very little effort to martial skills, resulting in them being weaker individuals who were clumsy with weapons.

Apothecars could not [[turn undead]].

==Possessions==
They wore the traditional blue robes of Mystra's clergy with their [[holy symbol]] worn around their neck.
