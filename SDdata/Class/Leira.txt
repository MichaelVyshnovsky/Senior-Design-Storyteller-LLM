'''Leira''' ({{Pronounce|LAIR|ah|audio=Leira.ogg|refs=|alt=yes}}), also known as '''Lady of Deception''' or the '''Lady of Mists''', was the goddess of deception and [[illusion]]s and patroness of [[illusionist]]s and liars.

|Leira is the Goddess of Deception, this wouldn’t be the first time she obscured her whereabouts from us, simply to prove her power to hide outstrips our ability and patience to seek.

==Personality==
She was an enigma, never telling the truth when falsehood would do. Everything she did and said was shrouded in layers of illusion and lies.

==Divine Realm==
Leira maintained a [[divine realm]] called the Courts of Illusion on the chaotic plane of [[Limbo]]. After her apparent demise, her body was thought to be adrift on the [[Astral Plane]], like those of other dead powers.

==Worshipers==
Leira had quite a small following. Her priests, known as Leirans, or Worshipers of the Mistshadow, wore silver [[mask (object)|masks]] and often disguised themselves to deceive those around them. Leirans would speak the truth only to other Leirans. High-level [[cleric]]s of the Leiran faith were called Mistcallers.

Every morning, and on every moonlit night, Leirans lay face down and prayed to the Lady of the Mists. If there was any mist, Leirans would walk through it and pray. The most revered act in the Leiran faith was the ''"Unmasking"'', a purification ritual performed when new followers entered the faith or if a follower changed rank. During the ritual, the follower would walk barefaced among its peers while the clergy would hold up candles and reflective surfaces.

The faith of Leira was the state religion on the island of [[Nimbral]]{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Realm of Nimbral, Part Five: Laws and Heralds}}{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Realm of Nimbral, Part Six: Of Heralds and of the Nimbrese Character}}<ref> and its vassal state [[Samarach]]. When the people of Nimbral rebelled against the influence of Leira's clergy following her apparent death in the Time of Troubles,and banned state religions, the Leiran priests fled to Samarach and continued to hold sway there.

Not widely worshiped, the majority of her worshipers were users of [[illusion]] magic. While Leira may have had few dedicated followers, a worshiper of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] often would pay homage to her before an important decision or judgment.

===Orders===
;[[Mistcaller]]s: 
: Specialty priests of Leira with limited powers of illusion, the Mistcallers were the clerical order most commonly associated with the church, though no one could be sure how many there were.

;[[Mistwalker]]s: 
: A sect of the church first appearing after the [[Time of Troubles]], the [[Mistcaller]]s continued to display the ability to cast divine magic, but were purposefully ambiguous about the "alleged" death of their goddess and whether their magic was granted by a living Leira or by Cyric.

==Relationships==
Leira's allies were [[Mask]], who betrayed her, and [[Azuth]]. Though she had no enemies,

==History==
Months after the [[Time of Troubles|Avatar Crisis]], Leira was slain by the new deity of death, [[Cyric]], wielding the sword ''[[Godsbane]]'', which was in fact an avatar of Mask. Her portfolios were subsequently absorbed by the mad god.

Upon her death, her godly power erupted in a blast that reached her places of worship all across [[Faerûn]]. Motes of her divinity coalesced into incorporeal beings known as [[Glamer (outsider)|glamers]].{{Cite dragon/299/The Dragon's Bestiary}}

Some still believed Leira was alive and that she had used her death as a grand illusion, but the general consensus was that she was a dead power.

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it became known that Leira was in fact alive and delighted in the confusion created by rumors of her demise and return. At this time, the faithful of Cyric also considered her to be his daughter.
