'''Desert Riders''' were elite mounted [[warrior]]s who lived in [[Zakhara]].<ref group="note">Desert Rider was a [[fighter]] class kit for the [[Al-Qadim]] setting.

== Requirements ==
Only humans, [[elves]], and [[half-elves]] were desert riders.

== Role ==
Public opinion on desert riders varied depending on who was asked. The nomads, or [[Al-Badia]], revered the desert riders as true heroes who represented the traditional qualities of desert folk: bravery, honor, and freedom. Villagers of small towns often thought they were little better than wandering [[thieves]]. Realistically, both are right. Men and women of good and evil backgrounds became desert riders.

Desert riders viewed the city folk, or [[Al-Hadhar]], as lost souls who missed out on the freedom offered by the desert.

== Possessions ==
Due to constant exposure to extreme heat, desert riders rarely wore armor heavier than [[chain mail]]. A desert rider's most prized possession was his or her mount.

== Special Benefits ==
Desert riders possessed an uncanny ability to judge horse physiques, resulting in them owning the finest mounts available. Mounts under a desert riders care performed in a superior manner to when they were handled by ordinary folk.

== Special Hindrances ==
Attuned to the ways of the desert and little else, these warriors were awkward in any setting where they were removed from their beloved habitat.
