'''Inquisitors of the Drowning Goddess''' were adept [[kuo-toa]] [[monk]]s and [[rogue]]s that served the goddess [[Blibdoolpoolp]]. 

==Description==
The majority of the kuo-toa who chose this path were monitors who had been charged with the duty to protect their communities from internal dangers, such as insurgencies. These inquisitors did this with great ability, and used their skills  (intimidation, detection of falsehoods, and martial skill) to end any danger to the lawful authorities.

Inquisitors were utterly devoted, believing it a holy duty to keep the status quo. They  prevented any other kuo-toa from gathering sufficient strength to wreck havoc. Only their church and the goddess Blibdoolpoolp had any control over the actions of these elite few.

==Abilities==
Inquisitors of the Drowning Goddess were remarkably good at detecting falsehoods and intimidating those they questioned. These monks and rogues with devoted minds became resilient against mind-controlling [[magic]].
