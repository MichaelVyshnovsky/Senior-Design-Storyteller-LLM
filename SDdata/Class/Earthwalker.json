        "mainbody": "Earthwalkers were specialty priests devoted to Grumbar, the King of the Land Below the Roots.\nEarthwalkers often took stances against any social changes wherever they lived.\nMost earthwalkers were humans, but mountain dwarves, deep gnomes, duergar, and rock gnomes were also allowed. In the case of the dwarven races they were often pressured by their peers from becoming earthwalkers though.\nThey could not use magic items associated with the air or flying such as a flying carpet or cloak of the bat. They could cast arcane spells related to elemental earth in addition to their divine spells. They prayed for these wizard spells just like their did for their other spells. They possessed a degree of resistance to any spells or attacks related to the earth. Earthwalkers were not hindered or affected in any way by heavy armor made from any metal or other element from the earth, allowing them to move about as if they were wearing normal clothing. They could summon an earth elemental once per day that would remain under their control for one hour. They were granted stoneskin and earthenport to be used on a daily basis. Skilled earthwalkers could summon stronger earth elementals to serve them once per tenday. Particularly powerful earthwalkers could survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth without the need for sustenance of any kind, including air. Lastly, earthwalkers could cooperatively summon earth elementals that were much stronger than what they would normally be able to control by themselves.\nEarthwalkers only used blunt weapons. They favored heavier armor."
