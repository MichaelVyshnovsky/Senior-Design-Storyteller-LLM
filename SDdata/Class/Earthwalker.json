        "mainbody": "'''Earthwalkers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Grumbar]], the King of the Land Below the Roots.",
        "Activities": "Earthwalkers often took stances against any social changes wherever they lived.",
        "Culture": "Most earthwalkers were [[human]]s, but [[mountain dwarves]], [[deep gnome]]s, [[duergar]], and [[rock gnome]]s were also allowed. In the case of the dwarven races they were often pressured by their peers from becoming earthwalkers though.",
        "Abilities": "They could not use [[magic item]]s associated with the air or flying such as a ''[[flying carpet]]'' or ''[[cloak of the bat]]''. They could cast [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]]s related to elemental earth in addition to their [[Divine magic|divine]] spells. They prayed for these [[wizard]] spells just like their did for their other spells. They possessed a degree of resistance to any spells or attacks related to the earth. Earthwalkers were not hindered or affected in any way by heavy [[armor]] made from any metal or other element from the earth, allowing them to move about as if they were wearing normal clothing. They could summon an [[earth elemental]] once per day that would remain under their control for one hour. They were granted ''[[stoneskin]]'' and ''[[earthenport]]'' to be used on a daily basis. Skilled earthwalkers could summon stronger earth elementals to serve them once per tenday. Particularly powerful earthwalkers could survive on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] without the need for sustenance of any kind, including air. Lastly, earthwalkers could cooperatively summon earth elementals that were much stronger than what they would normally be able to control by themselves.",
        "Possessions": "Earthwalkers only used blunt weapons. They favored heavier armor."
