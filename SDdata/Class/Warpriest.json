        "mainbody": "Warpriests were battle-steeled and battle-ready clerics who fought for their deity when required whilst praying for peace.\nThese powerful members of the clergy were fierce warriors of strong will and full devotion to their deity. Warpriests spent their days preparing for war, tirelessly bribing their bodies, praying, and leading armies into training exercises. When not partaking in military training, warpriests studied history and developed their diplomacy and leadership skills. In times of peace, warpriests could be found scouting lands or spying on their nations enemies. These clerics rarely embarked on adventurers unless they searched for specific artifacts or magic weapons to bolster their military might.\nThese clerics were worshipers of Amaunator, Angharradh, Bahamut, Berronar Truesilver, Corellon, Garl Glittergold, Gond, Grumbar, Ilmater, Kelemvor, Moradin, Oghma, Sel√ªne, Silvanus, Sune,Tempus, Torm, or Uthgar.\nthumb|A tiefling warpriest of the Raven Queen.\nLike clerics, warpriests accessed divine spells of destruction, protection, strength, or war domain, among others, depending on the church they belonged to. Warpriests also were able to channel magics of positive or negative energy, turn undead, and were trained in casting spells in the heat of close combat.\nWarpriests were trained in handling all simple and martial types of weapons and in wearing all types of armor and shields. When leading armies, warpriests had skills and charisma to rally troops, create an aura of feat that sent their enemies fleeing in terror, and they had magical abilities to cast spells that affected large groups of allies, in addition to the regular cleric and warpriest domain magics. These spells included healing circle, heroes feast, mass haste, mass healing, and implacable foe, once per day each.\n*Captain Baergil, a mid-14 century DR Captain of the Riders of Mistledale and a priest of Tempus.\n*Barrok Erlurender, a renowned wandering warpriest of Tempus in the 15 century DR.\n*Gogrin, a dwarvish warpriest who served the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 century DR."
