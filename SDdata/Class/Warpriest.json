        "mainbody": "'''Warpriests''' were battle-steeled and battle-ready [[clerics]] who fought for their deity when required whilst praying for peace.",
        "Activities": "These powerful members of the clergy were fierce warriors of strong will and full devotion to their deity. Warpriests spent their days preparing for war, tirelessly bribing their bodies, praying, and leading armies into training exercises. When not partaking in military training, warpriests studied history and developed their diplomacy and leadership skills. In times of peace, warpriests could be found scouting lands or spying on their nations' enemies. These clerics rarely embarked on adventurers unless they searched for specific artifacts or magic weapons to bolster their military might.\n\nThese clerics were worshipers of [[Amaunator]], [[Angharradh]], [[Bahamut]], [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Corellon]], [[Garl Glittergold]], [[Gond]], [[Grumbar]], [[Ilmater]], [[Kelemvor]], [[Moradin]], [[Oghma]], [[Sel√ªne]], [[Silvanus]], [[Sune]],[[Tempus]], [[Torm]], or [[Uthgar]].",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Warpriest of raven queen.jpg|thumb|''A [[tiefling]] warpriest of the [[Raven Queen]].'']]\nLike clerics, warpriests accessed divine [[spell]]s of [[destruction domain|destruction]], [[Protection domain|protection]], [[Strength domain|strength]], or [[War domain|war domain]], among others, depending on the church they belonged to. Warpriests also were able to channel magics of [[positive energy|positive]] or [[negative energy]], ''[[turn undead]]'', and were trained in casting spells in the heat of close combat.\n\nWarpriests were trained in handling all simple and martial types of weapons and in wearing all types of [[armor]] and [[shield]]s. When leading armies, warpriests had skills and charisma to rally troops, create an aura of feat that sent their enemies fleeing in terror, and they had magical abilities to cast spells that affected large groups of allies, in addition to the regular cleric and warpriest domain magics. These spells included ''[[healing circle]]'', ''[[heroes' feast]]'', ''[[mass haste]]'', ''[[mass healing]]'', and ''[[implacable foe]]'', once per day each.",
