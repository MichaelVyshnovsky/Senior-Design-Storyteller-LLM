All outriders had skills in mounted combat, mounted archery, riding, and scouting skills like listening and spotting.\nDefensive riding The outrider could assume a defensive riding style to outmaneuver enemy attacks. When riding defensively, they could not attack or perform any other actions.\nDeflect attack The rider could use a one-handed weapon or shield to deflect an attack against her mount.\nLeap from the saddle If the mount was not moving too fast, the rider could quickly dismount on the move.
