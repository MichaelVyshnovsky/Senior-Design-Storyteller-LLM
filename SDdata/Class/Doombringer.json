        "mainbody": "oombringers were bastions of vengeance and righting injustices. These specialty priests devoted themselves to Hoar, the Hurler of Thunders.\nAs with other members of Hoars clergy, Doombringers often spent their time travelling around, offering prayers to Hoar on the behalf of those who sought vengeance. Doombringers also helped those who suffered grave injustices.\nThough they could not turn undead like other priests, doombringers could attempt to command nearby undead.\nDoombringers could incite a focused rage upon a specific being on whom they sought vengeance. The rage made it much easier for the doombringer to strike and harm their targets, and resist the effects of any magical attacks directed at them from the same targets. Once held within the grip of their rage, a doombringer would relentlessly attack until the target was killed or incapacitated.\nDoombringers were capable of exercising a prayer of revenance if they were present when someone who sought vengeance died. The prayer would cause the deceased to rise as a revenant so they could exact their vengeance in the afterlife.\nAny doombringer killed in an unjust manner would always rise from their grave as a revenant. The difference between these creatures and regular revenants was that the undead doombringer was not always susceptible to harm from fire.\nDoombringers gained a wide variety of magical abilities as they gained power. These included being able to use shocking grasp, lightning bolt, hand of Hoar, and thunder staff on a daily basis.\nEspecially powerful doombringers had a permanent aura that acted like the protection from normal missiles spell.\nDoombringers were not restricted in the type of armor they wore. All doombringers were proficient in the use of a single blunt, slashing, and piercing weapon. They always carried one of each kind of weapon in order to exact vengeance on anyone who caused them harm with the same type of weapon."
