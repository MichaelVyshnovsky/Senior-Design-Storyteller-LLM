        "mainbody": "Laduguer () was the lawful evil dwarven deity of the duergar. The Exile harboured a bitter resentment against the rest of the Morndinsamman ever since he was cast out, although he maintained he left voluntarily.\nLaduguer appeared as a bald, gaunt,  or  tall duergar with skin that changed from gray to brown to match his environment and a perpetual frown.\nAs a ruler, Laduguer was grim, gloomy, and absent of joy. He was supremely lawful, but while doubtlessly also evil-inclined, much of this was evil turned inwards, bitterness towards rejection and underappreciation. Despite viewing his peers as obsessing with tradition at the expense of progress, he was not a free-thinker himself but a harsh and unbending taskmaster who adhered strictly to his own brand of intolerant discipline. He demanded his duergar engage in constant toil under harsh conditions, but did reward their dilligence through his protection and teachings on how to craft magical items.\nLaduguer viewed the rest of the dwarven pantheon most unfavorably, despising them as indolent and feckless layabouts bound to outdated conventions.\nLaduguer was at best tolerated by Dugmaren and Sharindlar &mdash the rest of the pantheon held him in deep scorn.\nDeep Duerra, thought to be his daughter, was his only true ally - even she hatched many schemes against him. His races dominance over the trade of steeders gained him the enmity of Lolth and he had ancient disputes with the demon prince Orcus.\nthumb|A priest of Laduguer.\nThe duergar might worship Laduguer, but even they did not love their severe god, stoicly following him (among other reasons) out of the belief that only the strong were worthy of life.\nThe duergar did not differentiate between secular and religious authority, so Laduguers clergy served as the nominal rulers of society. They were known as the thuldor (\"those who endure\") and they kept the race united and powerful against the other races of the Underdark. They were expected to serve in the military.\nMany temples included large stables used to care for and breed steeders large, monstrous riding spiders.\nthumb|right|300px|The Symbol of Laduguer.\nLaduguer had been exiled from the Morndinsamman. The gold and shield dwarves claimed he committed unspeakable crimes and was only saved from Moradins wrath by Berronar Truesilver. The grey dwarves, however, said he was an advocate of righteous, innovative philosophy that offended Moradin so much that he cast him out.\nIn 1383 DR, Laduguer and Deep Duerra were both destroyed. Most Worshipers of Laduguer did not realize this, however, as Asmodeus took up the guise of Laduguer in an effort to gain more followers. Duergar began making pacts with devils as a result, securing infernal power for themselves.\nFollowing the Second Sundering, Laduguer was once again present and revered by the duergar, although the circumstances of his return were unknown."
