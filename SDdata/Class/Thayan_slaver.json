        "Culture": "Considering there were fewer realms that allowed slavery as opposed to those who opposed it, Thayan slavers often worked under some guise that granted them anonymity.\n\nThey often congregated in the great Thayan cities of [[Bezantur]], [[Eltabbar]], and [[Tyraturos]], each of which had a sprawling slave market.",
        "Abilities": "Slavers were highly skilled at inflicting non-lethal harm with their attacks.\n\nSimilarly, Thayan slavers were considered experts at breaking down the will of other beings.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Reg Neroz|Reg Neroz \"the Whip\"]], one of the most infamous slavers operating in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]\n* [[Faxam Rul]], another notorious slaver who harried the lands of [[Thesk]]"
