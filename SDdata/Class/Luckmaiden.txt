Luckmaidens were specialty priests devoted to Haela Brightaxe, the Lady of the Fray.
The vast majority of luckmaidens were shield dwarves or gold dwarves, but female members of all of the dwarf races could become a luckmaiden.
Luckmaidens were skilled weaponsmiths. Haela Brightaxe blessed her luckmaidens so they had a stronger chance of resisting the effects of spells and other such attacks during combat. Their practice with weaponry allowed them to strike more often during combat, similar to a warrior.
In addition to their normal spells, luckmaidens could cast armor, shield, aid, strength, draw upon holy might, lighten load, prayer, flame strike, heal, and heroes feast on a daily basis. Furthermore, they could detect weapons at will.
Luckmaidens did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the armor they were allowed to wear.
