Malagents were masters of poisons and sadistic specialty priests devoted to Talona, the Lady of Poison.
Most malagents underwent some form of ritual tattooing or self-mutilation upon their initiation into the faith.
Given the nature of their goddess, all malagents were skilled herbalists and naturally resistant to poisons. Malagents were also immune to all nonmagical diseases and resistant to magical ones. These individuals gained expertise with poisons the more they worked with them allowing them to identify a poison by its smell, taking a sip of a poisoned drink, and taking a small bite of poisoned food.
Malagents could spread contagion, use a poison touch, cause disease by touch, and exhale a cloud of pestilence or stinking cloud once per day.
All malagents carried a special ceremonial dagger that had poison grooves along both sides of the blade. The symbol of Talona was typically worked into the handle of these daggers. Aside from the ceremonial dagger, malagents wielded a blunt weapon of some type. Malagents did not have restrictions on the type of armor they could wear.
