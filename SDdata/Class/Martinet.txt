Martinets were specialty priests devoted to Gilgeam, the Supreme Ruler of Unther.
As with all of Gilgeams clergy, martinets were deeply involved in the governing of Unther.
Marinets were always humans of Mulan ancestry.
A martinet could choose to have Gilgeam permanently boost their physical strength in exchange for sacrificing some of their wisdom. Many were highly skilled wrestlers just like Gilgeam.
Martinets could cast strength, strength of one, and free action once per day. They could also cast draw upon holy might and right of might once per tenday and tyranny once per month.
Weapons used commonly by martinets included the mace, quarterstaff, flail and staff sling. The heaviest armor they wore was scale mail or bronze plate mail and martinets never used a shield.
