'''Martinets''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Gilgeam]], the Supreme Ruler of [[Unther]].

==Activities==
As with all of Gilgeam's clergy, martinets were deeply involved in the governing of Unther.

==Culture==
Marinets were always [[human]]s of [[Mulan]] ancestry.

==Abilities==
A martinet could choose to have Gilgeam permanently boost their physical strength in exchange for sacrificing some of their wisdom. Many were highly skilled wrestlers just like Gilgeam.

Martinets could cast ''[[strength]]'', ''[[strength of one]]'', and ''[[free action]]'' once per day. They could also cast ''[[draw upon holy might]]'' and ''[[right of might]]'' once per tenday and ''[[Tyranny (spell)|tyranny]]'' once per month.

==Possessions==
Weapons used commonly by martinets included the [[mace]], [[quarterstaff]], [[flail]] and [[staff sling]]. The heaviest [[armor]] they wore was [[scale mail]] or [[plate mail|bronze plate mail]] and martinets never used a [[shield]].
