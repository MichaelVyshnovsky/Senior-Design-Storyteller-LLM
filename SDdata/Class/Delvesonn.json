        "mainbody": "'''Delvesonns''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Dumathoin]], the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain.",
        "Culture": "The vast majority of delvesonns were [[shield dwarves]] or [[urdunnirin]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, both males and females, could become a delvesonn. Particularly powerful delvesonns were sometimes selected by Dumathoin to become his [[chosen]].",
        "Abilities": "Delvesonns were always skilled blacksmiths or weaponsmiths. They also excelled at mining and mountaineering.\n\nIn addition to their normal [[spell]]s, delvesonns could cast ''[[fist of stone]]'', ''[[detect metals and minerals]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', and ''[[passwall]]'' on a daily basis. Additionally, they could cast ''[[identify]]'' at will and ''[[stone tell]]'' three times per day. Dumathoin's blessing protected a delvesonn at all times similar to wearing a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', protecting their mind from magical intrusions of [[psionic]]s and spells such as ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''etc''.",
        "Possessions": "Delvesonns did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the [[armor]] they were allowed to wear."
