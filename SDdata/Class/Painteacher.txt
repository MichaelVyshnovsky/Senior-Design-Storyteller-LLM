Painteachers were specialty priests of the Church of Loviatar who served as inquisitors of the Maiden of Pain.
As inquisitors, painteachers sought weak-willed targets in order to end their lives.
Painteachers understood the difference between the varieties of pain and used it as a communication tool. They were quite fearless and accepted pain upon their own bodies with relish. One earned their respect by retaining their dignity under torture.
These individuals could usually get what they wanted through their impressive skills at intimidation and were never intimidated themselves. Their close experience with pain made it possible for them to not only remain conscious, but also to continue fighting when severely injured. All painteachers were immune to the symbol of pain.
Any healing spell cast by a painteacher was weaker than if cast by another priest. The healing would also cause pain in the victim while restoring their wounds. Since they relied heavily upon their torture skills during interrogation, the effects of their divination spells were also weaker. Painteachers were unable to turn undead.
Painteachers wore pleated scale armor covered with a nearly transparent cloak of black gauze. Many also wore a black silk hood to portray a menacing appearance. For most, the weapon of choice was either a cat-o-nine-tails or a morning star.
