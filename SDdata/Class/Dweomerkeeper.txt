'''Dweomerkeepers''' were the [[specialty priest]]s who dedicated themselves to the various iterations of the Goddess of Magic, including the ancient [[Mystryl]] and [[Mystra|both incarnations]] of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]. Over the centuries they served the Lady of Mysteries by tending to the [[Weave]] and protecting it against those who sought to warp its cohesion.

==Culture==
These Mystran [[spellcaster]]s were found all across the Realms and lived a wide range of lifestyles, from cloistered scholars who remained in isolation to cosmopolitan [[wizard]]s who preferred [[Faer√ªn]]'s great metropolises.

Dweomerkeepers formed a powerful connections with the Weave but were forbidden from tapping into the [[Shadow Weave]].

==Abilities==
Both in ancient [[Netheril]] and contemporary times, Dweomerkeepers were granted great boons by their goddess. They gained inherent protections from all forms of magic and their spells functioned normally in  [[dead-magic zone]]s or areas affected by [[wild magic]]. They could readily ''[[read magic|read scrolls and spellbooks]]'' and gained the ability to ''[[detect magic|detect]]'' and ''[[dispel magic]]'' once per day.

As they progressed in their training Dweomerkeepers of Mystryl learned to mimic [[metamagic]]al effects and cast spells quicker than other priests. They were granted access to a limited selection of [[Arcane magic|arcane spells]] and given the ability to ''[[air walk|walk upon air]]'' once every day if they so wished.

The most powerful dweomerkeepers gained protections against magic. They became significantly resistant to all manner of magical spells and were invulnerable to three specific spells of their choosing.

Dweomerkeepers who served the aspect of Mystra were granted different boons than the protectors of the Weave that came before them. They were granted improved sight in form of [[darkvision]] and allowed to cast one of Mystra's signature spells, ''[[Mystra's lingering touch]]''.

More experienced dweomerkeepers were allowed to maintain personal ''[[spell mantle]]s'', such as those maintained by [[mage]]s and other arcane spellcasters. The most powerful among their ranks were wrapped in a unique ''mantle'', referred to as a "cloak of mysteries", which allowed them to more readily tap into metamagic abiltiies when casting their spells.

==History==
The dweomerkeepers were one of the longest-serving orders of specialty priests, having served their goddess for millennia.

==Notable Dweomerkeepers==
