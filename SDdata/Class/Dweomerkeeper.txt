Dweomerkeepers were the specialty priests who dedicated themselves to the various iterations of the Goddess of Magic, including the ancient Mystryl and both incarnations of Mystra. Over the centuries they served the Lady of Mysteries by tending to the Weave and protecting it against those who sought to warp its cohesion.
These Mystran spellcasters were found all across the Realms and lived a wide range of lifestyles, from cloistered scholars who remained in isolation to cosmopolitan wizards who preferred Faer√ªns great metropolises.
Dweomerkeepers formed a powerful connections with the Weave but were forbidden from tapping into the Shadow Weave.
Both in ancient Netheril and contemporary times, Dweomerkeepers were granted great boons by their goddess. They gained inherent protections from all forms of magic and their spells functioned normally in  dead-magic zones or areas affected by wild magic. They could readily read scrolls and spellbooks and gained the ability to detect and dispel magic once per day.
As they progressed in their training Dweomerkeepers of Mystryl learned to mimic metamagical effects and cast spells quicker than other priests. They were granted access to a limited selection of arcane spells and given the ability to walk upon air once every day if they so wished.
The most powerful dweomerkeepers gained protections against magic. They became significantly resistant to all manner of magical spells and were invulnerable to three specific spells of their choosing.
Dweomerkeepers who served the aspect of Mystra were granted different boons than the protectors of the Weave that came before them. They were granted improved sight in form of darkvision and allowed to cast one of Mystras signature spells, Mystras lingering touch.
More experienced dweomerkeepers were allowed to maintain personal spell mantles, such as those maintained by mages and other arcane spellcasters. The most powerful among their ranks were wrapped in a unique mantle, referred to as a "cloak of mysteries", which allowed them to more readily tap into metamagic abiltiies when casting their spells.
The dweomerkeepers were one of the longest-serving orders of specialty priests, having served their goddess for millennia.
