        "Difference from other Clerics": {
            "Differences in Powers": "The options for powers possessed by every cleric was very varied. This was because the cleric was offered a huge variety of powers from every member of his pantheon. A specialty priest was limited in his choices even to the point of forfeiting some, like the ability to [[turn undead]]. In return, a specialty priest gained specific powers from his specific deity, which starkly differed from those of a standard cleric.",
            "Difference in Reception": "A cleric was—at least in theory—respected and liked by the entire pantheon, both by its members and priests thereof, A specialty priest on the other hand was poorly received by other members of the pantheon of the deity he or she worshiped, and by their followers, although of course exceptions existed."
        },
        "History": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], it was unheard for non-[[human]] deities &mdash; such as those of the [[Dwarven pantheon]], [[Elven pantheon]], [[Gnome pantheon]], and [[Halfling pantheon]] &mdash; to have specialty priests. With the passing of that event, specialty priests for these pantheons began to emerge in [[Evermeet]], the [[Great Rift]], and in the nation of [[Luiren]].<ref>"
