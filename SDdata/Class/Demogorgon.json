He was worshiped by the intelligent manta ray race known as [[ixitxachitl]]s, who drew power from the Abyss itself in order to become more powerful spellcasters. In turn, vital energy drained by [[vampiric ixitxachitl]]s was transferred directly to Demogorgon via an unknown Abyssal mechanism.\n\nDemogorgon's other worshipers included [[troglodyte]]s, [[kuo-toa]], and other [[humanoid]]s, particularly evil [[human]]s. His cult prospered in times of chaos and caused great destruction wherever it was found. Temples to Demogorgon were split in half, with one side representing Aameul and the other representing Hethradiah. Demogorgon's domains were [[Chaos domain|Chaos]], [[Corruption domain|Corruption]], [[Demonic domain|Demonic]], and [[Evil domain|Evil]]. His symbol was that of a forked tail, often wrapped around a skull or sword.\n\nDemogorgon was sufficiently powerful to offer patronage pacts with [[warlock]]s, who usually kept [[quasit]]s as familiars. His most devout followers were granted magic boons, such as an aspect of his dual minds that conferred resistance to mind-affecting effects.

        "Divine Realm": "Demogorgon lived on the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 88: Gaping Maw|88{{th}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]], known as the [[Gaping Maw]]. This was a layer consisting of a great sea of briny water broken by tall, sharp, ugly, rocky promontories. Demogorgon's palace, called [[Abysm]], consisted of two twin towers roughly shaped like tightly coiled serpents, crowned at the top with skull-shaped minarets. The two towers were linked by a bridge near the top. Most of the fortress lay underwater beneath the towers.\n\nDemogorgon also kept a fortress in the bog of the Gaping Maw called [[Ungorth Reddik]]. This was where he housed his armies of [[hezrou]]s, aboleths, [[scrag]]s, [[skum]], and [[ichythoid]] creatures. The fortress was guarded by unusual [[retriever]]s, [[golem]]s, and other evil [[construct]]s. Demogorgon was also served by [[abyssal marauder]]s.\n\nThe only significant landmass of the layer was a vast continent covered in tropical jungles.

        "History": {
            "Origin and Ascension": "[[File:Demogorgon.png|thumb|right|300px|The Prince of Demons]]\nThere were conflicting legends about the origin of Demogorgon. One account claimed that he was the first of the [[tanar'ri]], who originated out of the consolidated fear of mortal souls, shortly after the [[obyrith]] [[Obox-ob]] was defeated by the [[Queen of Chaos]]. Cast aside as a deformity with his boneless arms and twin heads, Demogorgon lay hidden while the Queen of Chaos used [[sibriex]]es to better shape other primal mortal emotions into more refined tanar'ri.\n\nAnother legend claimed that Demogorgon was originally a [[primordial]] and the first of his kind to set foot in the Abyss shortly after the formation of the plane, followed closely by Dagon, who challenged him for control of the plane. As he and Demogorgon fought, Obox-ob seized the opportunity to become the first Prince of Demons. A temporary alliance between Demogorgon, Orcus, and [[Baphomet]] was formed to defeat Obox-ob.\n\nAccording to this second legend, Demogorgon once had a single head until a blow from [[Amoth]] split it in two. Soon after that battle, Demogorgon defeated the stone [[primordial]] [[Storralk]]. He kept Storralk beneath his throne, torturing him for eternity through a ritual that created the [[ettin]]s from Storralk's blood and linked them to his body. Every time an ettin felt pain, that agony was transferred to Storralk.\n\nIn both accounts, Obox-ob had since vowed to murder Demogorgon and reclaim his title.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Queen of Chaos at the hands of the tanar'ri, the leading demon lords Graz'zt and Orcus then competed for the title of Prince of Demons. At that moment, Demogorgon, who had grown stronger during his exile, launched a massive assault throughout the plane to crush his rivals' forces. After he slew a dozen demon lords, draining their life forces with his tentacles, even Graz'zt and Orcus were forced to kneel. Thus, Demogorgon asserted his position as Prince of Demons.\n\nAt one point, Demogorgon and Dagon worked up an alliance of sorts, given the proximity of the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 89: The Shadowsea|Shadowsea]] to Gaping Maw.",
            "Recorded History": "[[File:Demogorgon_in_darklake-5e.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Demogorgon rampaging in the Darklake toward Sloobludop.'']]\nOver a millennium before the [[Era of Upheaval]], Demogorgon was shackled and imprisoned in [[Faerûn]]. within the fortress of [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Tethyr]].\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], the magic maintaining Demogorgon's prison began to fail. In response, [[Helm]] himself tasked an [[Knights of the Vigil|order of his knights]] to maintain the magic that kept \"Imprisoned One\" from escaping into the [[Prime Material plane]]. After some time the magic would expire, and members of the order would venture deep within the keep to complete the [[ritual]] that would sacrifice their life in order to restore the magical seal.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Odren]] and the knights sought to break the cycle of sacrifice their order undertook. The Knights of the Vigil petitioned the famous adventurer [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions to perform the ritual in place of the knights and keep Demogorgon sealed away once again. While it was unknown if the ritual was performed again, Demogorgon was not sealed away forever and at some point returned to the Abyss.\n\nOn [[Nightal 15]], [[1486 DR]], [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan|Archmage]] [[Gromph Baenre]] weakened the barriers of ''[[faerzress]]'', inadvertently \"summoning\" Demogorgon and allowing him to pass from the Abyss to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. He arrived at the tower of [[Sorcere]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] and cut a swath of destruction as he exited the cavern. Gromph was able to weaken the ''faerzress'' because of his study of [[psionics]] and the psychic conveyance of a plan devised by the goddess [[Lolth]].\n\n[[File:Drizzt vs Demogorgon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Drizzt and Demogorgon in battle.'']]\n\nIn [[1487 DR]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] defeated Demogorgon in Menzoberranzan by acting as a conduit for a barrage of magical energy, released upon him and held by the kinetic barrier of an [[illithid]] hive-mind.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], as a result of a vision of the demon lord in the [[Darklake]], a faction of the kuo-toa of [[Sloobludop]] started a cult of Demogorgon."
