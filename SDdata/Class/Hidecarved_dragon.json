        "mainbody": "A hidecarved dragon was a member of an enigmatic order of mystic dragons, famous for the runes they carved onto their hides.\nA hidecarved dragon slowly learned to suppress, and then overcome, their own elemental weaknesses, while developing broad resistances to other elements. Their inherent ability to thwart spells aimed at them was boosted as well, and slowly they added resistances to poison, and enchantments their ability to shrug off nonmagical weapons was also enhanced.\nNear the pinnacle of their disciplines, hidecarved dragons became capable of healing their own wounds, gained complete immunity to poison, and the ability to cast death ward to bolster themselves. Once they reached the pinnacle, they had not only overcome their elemental weakness and turned it into a resistance, they had developed two more energy immunities and were able to shrug off just about any weapon, magical or not, save for those that transcended the limits of known magic and were also aligned with chaotic energies.\n* Ishenalyr"
