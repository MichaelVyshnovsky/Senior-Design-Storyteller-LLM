'''Hephaestus''' was a multispheric interloper [[deity]] of artisans, craftsmen, and smiths of the [[Olympian pantheon]]. His existence was known by a few on [[Toril]], but overall he was rather obscure in the Realms.

==Description==
[[File:Hephaestus-Symbol.jpg|thumb|273px|''The holy symbol of Hephaestus.'']]
He was considered by some to be the only unattractive deity within his pantheon, due to having a [[Wikipedia:club foot|club foot]] and hunchback. He bore a resemblance to [[hill giant]]s and had a full beard. He stood roughly {{SI|20|ft}} tall.

Hephaestus's [[avatar]] usually took the form of a muscular [[human]] male with shaggy, dark hair and untrimmed beards, with some kind of physical deformity.

==Personality==
Hephaestus was a very peaceful and generally benevolent deity, but this could be confounded by his sensitivity towards his deformity. 

He highly valued and taught the virtues of hard labor, honesty and dependability. He emphasized loyalty to family and whomever else it was due &mdash; such as superiors, just rulers, and most of all elders. He encouraged his followers to tackle their problems with vigor and persistence.

==Abilities==
Hephaestus was impervious to harm from [[fire]]. He could cast at will the spells could ''[[teleport without error]]'' and ''[[plane shift]]''. His skills related to the working of metal and stone were incredible.

In addition to being capable of casting [[spell]]s from the school of [[alteration]], some of the many spells that Hephaestus knew included the following:

: ''[[aid]]'', ''[[animate rope]]'', ''[[blade barrier]]'', ''[[bless]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[dispel evil]]'', ''[[earthquake]]'', ''[[elemental swarm]]'' (Only in the form of fire and [[earth (element)|earth]]), ''[[fabricate]]'', ''[[fire seeds]]'', ''[[fire shield]]'', ''[[fire storm]]''. ''[[hardening]]'', ''[[heroes' feast]]'', ''[[holy aura]]'', ''[[holy smite]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[incendiary cloud]]'', ''[[iron body]]'', ''[[magic circle against evil]]'', ''[[magic stone]]'', ''[[major creation]]'', ''[[mass heal]]'', ''[[minor creation]]'', ''[[miracle]]'', ''[[Prayer (spell)|prayer]]'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[Rary's telepathic bond]]'', ''[[Refuge (spell)|refuge]]'', ''[[resist elements]]'', ''[[shield other]]'', ''[[soften earth and stone]]'', ''[[spike stones]]'', ''[[status]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[summon monster IX]]'', ''[[true creation]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[wall of stone]]'', and ''[[wood shape]]''.

==Combat==
This deity typically wielded a {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}} [[warhammer]] that had a ''+5 [[flaming burst]] [[item enchantment|enchantment]].

==Realm==
Hephaestus lived and worked within a volcanic section of [[Mount Olympus]], in the [[divine realm]] known as [[Olympus]]. This volcano was situated in an area where volcanic activity was quite common. His workshop had animated chairs and tables.

==History==
After she had discovered that [[Zeus]] was having multiple affairs, his wife [[Hera]] created Hephaestus wholly from her body. When Zeus discovered this, the god was so furious at her insolence that he hurled Hephaestus down on to the [[Prime Material plane]], where he impacted so terribly that his body was injured, giving him a clubfoot and hunchback. Some time later he reconciled with Zeus and became a welcomed member of their pantheon. 

Hephaestus went on to marry the Olympian goddess [[Aphrodite]]

==Activities==
Hephaestus spent much of his time crafting armor, structures, tools, and weaponry for the other deities within his pantheon. This included forging the thunderbolts that Zeus would hurl at his enemies. His most preferred metal to work with was [[adamantine]], as he worked best with extremely hard metals.

His avatars were often sent to observe volcanic eruptions and witness or assist in epic feats of smithing.
==Relationships==
[[File:Hephaestus&Cyclops.png|thumb|273px|''A depiction of the god Hephaestus hammering away at an anvil alongside one of his cyclops servitors.'']]
Hephaestus had many [[cyclops|cyclopes]] that lived inside his volcanic mountain home with him, assisting in his craftsmen activities. Other creatures that lived with him as helpers included [[efreeti]] and [[fire elemental]]s. In addition, the tunnel entrance to his lair was guarded by a [[red dragon]].

He was one of the closest allies of the [[dwarven pantheon|dwarven deity]] [[Dumathoin]] and was supplied by him with adamantine ore.{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}} The [[Gnome pantheon|gnomish deity]] [[Nebelun]] occasionally visited him, offering advice and help, and at times they created incredible items together. Some claimed that Hephaestus had an ongoing rivalry with other deities who had the forge in their portfolios, but little was known about it.

Although he was married to Aphrodite, Hephaestus had affection for [[Athena]], but she either didn't notice or chose to show ignorance.

==Worshipers==
[[File:Hephaestus-Manifestation.png|thumb|273px|''Hephaestus manifests in the fires of some forge.'']]
Hephaestus had very few followers, some of which included [[dwarves]].{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}} His followers were typically artisans, craftsmen, and smiths. Because he had so few worshipers he sought to treat them very well, often crafting them gifts in the form of adamantine armor, shields, and weapons with a [[item enchantment|''+5 enchantment'']].

The [[priest]]s of his faith typically wielded [[hammer]]s as weapons and wore a leather [[apron]] as part of their priestly vestments. They were often skilled in creating and repairing magical armor and weapons. In their temple smithies they worked alongside the worshipers of Hephaestus, encouraging finer production, offering or receiving training, and developing new forging techniques. When not working at their forges his priests were charged with maintaining civic life, performing a wide range of public ceremonies.

Before anyone was accepted into his clergy, Hephaestus would send his avatar to see how they reacted to a deformed individual. Those who did not show kindness would be rejected. For one of the duties of his clergy was to help the crippled and disabled of society.

On Toril, the [[dwarves]] of [[Faerûn]] occasionally showed reverence for Hephaestus, due to him representing powers of smith-work and the earth, but this was only a rare occurrence.{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}}
===Places of Worship===
Temples and shrines to Hephaestus typically had a fire that was kept perpetually lit. Most also included a smithy or other workshop.{{Cite dragon/153/Following in their Footsteps|30}}

==Trivia==
* The [[red dragon]] [[Velcuthimmorhar]] was also known by the alias "Hephaestus" in reference to him.
* Within the Realms there existed a [[book]] titled ''[[Hephaestus, God of Blacksmiths]]''. One copy of this tome laid within [[Bard Keep]], a temple of [[Oghma]] that stood within [[the North]] near [[Silverymoon]].{{Cite dungeon/29/Ex Libris|38}}
* The deity was known to the [[firbolg]] [[Morten]] under his alias Vulcan. When Morten had a hot [[fire poker]] pressed against his face by the [[hill giant]] chieftain [[Noote]] in [[1366 DR]], he compared the pain filling his head to being hit by Vulcan's hammer.<ref>
