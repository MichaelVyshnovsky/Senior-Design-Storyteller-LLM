        "mainbody": "'''Iceguardians''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Ulutiu]], the Lord in the Ice.",
        "Culture": "Iceguardians were always [[ice hunter]] [[human]]s native to the [[Great Glacier]] called [[Ulutiun]]s. They abided by the taboo that they would never personally start a fire. Doing so would cause them to lose all of their special abilities. They could however enjoy the benefits of a fire started by someone else.",
        "Abilities": "They eventually became completely immune to all normal and magical cold-based attacks save for a [[white dragon]]'s breath weapon, powerful [[artifact]]s, or other such powerful creatures. They had access to [[elemental water]] [[wizard]] [[spell]]s or any other spells related to cold, chill, snow, and ice. They could cast ''[[ice storm]]'' , ''[[wall of ice]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', and ''[[Otiluke's freezing sphere]]'' once per day. They could ''[[shapechange]]'' into their totem animal twice per tenday.\n\nThe [[magic]] and special abilities an ice hunter shaman had access to depended on their tribal totem animal. Their powers are outlined below:\n* With [[Clever Oomio]], they could bestow ''[[selkie form]]'' upon themselves or others once per day for ten minutes.\n* With [[Grandfather Walrus]], they could call upon ''[[tusks of strength]]'' for themselves and others once per day for ten minutes.\n* With [[Great White Bear]], they could call upon ''[[polar fury]]'' for themselves and others once per day for ten minutes.\n* With [[Pindalpau-pau]], the Reindeer Mother, they could call upon ''[[horns of wisdom]]'' or ''[[reindeer hooves]]'' for themselves and others once per day for ten minutes.",
        "Possessions": "They typically wore [[leather armor|leather]] or [[hide armor]] and never carried a [[shield]]. Some weapons favored by nakurits included the [[short bow]], [[dagger]], [[ritiik]], [[spear]], [[trident]], and [[iuak]]."
