        "mainbody": "ceguardians were specialty priests devoted to Ulutiu, the Lord in the Ice.\nIceguardians were always ice hunter humans native to the Great Glacier called Ulutiuns. They abided by the taboo that they would never personally start a fire. Doing so would cause them to lose all of their special abilities. They could however enjoy the benefits of a fire started by someone else.\nThey eventually became completely immune to all normal and magical cold-based attacks save for a white dragons breath weapon, powerful artifacts, or other such powerful creatures. They had access to elemental water wizard spells or any other spells related to cold, chill, snow, and ice. They could cast ice storm , wall of ice, cone of cold, and Otilukes freezing sphere once per day. They could shapechange into their totem animal twice per tenday.\nThe magic and special abilities an ice hunter shaman had access to depended on their tribal totem animal. Their powers are outlined below\n* With Clever Oomio, they could bestow selkie form upon themselves or others once per day for ten minutes.\n* With Grandfather Walrus, they could call upon tusks of strength for themselves and others once per day for ten minutes.\n* With Great White Bear, they could call upon polar fury for themselves and others once per day for ten minutes.\n* With Pindalpau-pau, the Reindeer Mother, they could call upon horns of wisdom or reindeer hooves for themselves and others once per day for ten minutes.\nThey typically wore leather or hide armor and never carried a shield. Some weapons favored by nakurits included the short bow, dagger, ritiik, spear, trident, and iuak."
