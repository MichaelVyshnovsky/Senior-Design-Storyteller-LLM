'''Nar demonbinders''' were masters of summoning [[demon]]s who maintained the black magic traditions of [[Narfell]].

==Culture==
The empire of Narfell achieved power thanks to the magic of its mages and priest-lords, though its conjuring of demons ultimately led to its collapse. Nevertheless, even over a millennium later, by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], spellcasters continued to delve into forgotten vaults and ruins seeking lost Nar lore and secrets. Scholars of high principles sought it so that they might better battle demons, but the reckless and immoral only desired the power and dark knowledge.

==Entry==
Nar demonbinders were usually [[cleric]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[wizard]]s, as a fair amount of skill with [[magic]] was demanded and only they knew the [[spell]]s needed to summon and command [[fiend]]s. Specifically, they needed to know one of the ''[[summon monster]]'' spells and to focus on [[conjuration]] magic.

They were also required to speak [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]] and to have a deep knowledge of planar lore. Furthermore, to deal with their demons, they needed a little skill in sensing deceit and more in intimidating them, and an iron will to resist them.

==Abilities==
A Nar demonbinder learned a narrow but powerful suite of [[arcane]] spells, casting them spontaneously as sorcerers did. They commanded spells of fire and the summoning, binding, and banishment of planar beings. In particular, with inimical casting, a demonbinder could change the effects of alignment-based spells to turn aside the attacks of opposing [[outsider]]s, whatever their own alignment. A demonbinder could turn ''[[dispel good]]'' into ''[[dispel evil]]'', ''[[dispel chaos]]'', or ''[[dispel law]]''; their ''[[magic circle against good]]'' the same way; a ''[[blasphemy]]'' as a ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[word of chaos]]'', or ''[[dictum]]''; and an ''[[unholy aura]]'' as a ''[[holy aura]]'', ''[[cloak of chaos]]'', or ''[[shield of law]]''.

Demonbinders could call forth a fiendish [[familiar]], either an [[imp]] or a [[quasit]]. As normal, it was linked to them in various ways and required a day-long ceremony to summon.

A demonbinder learned to craft a unique token called an "[[iron]] sign". This took three days and magical materials worth 1000 [[gp]]. It was the size of a large amulet and just had to be placed on an appropriate surface to function. It had two functions. First, it could serve as a ready-made calling diagram in a ''magic circle'' with a ''[[dimensional anchor]]'' for the purposes of a ''[[planar binding]]'', and it kept a called planar creature within {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} of it in the same way for a number of days. Unless physically moved, it could not be disrupted and the called creature could not disturb it in any way. Second, the demonbinder could try compel a nearby free outsider to move into this space and become trapped. The iron sign crumbled to dust when the trapped creature left (either at the demonbinder's permission or its own ingenuity) or its time expired.

Later, the demonbinder could make a "[[brass|brazen]] sign", over five days and costing 2000 [[gp]]. This worked the same way, but was more effective, as the creature's resistance to spells did not apply. Finally, they could make a "[[silver]] sign", over seven days and costing 5000 gp. This made it harder for the creature to escape and prevented its attacks and powers reaching outside the area.

A demonbinder became a master summoner, becoming better able to compel or trap planar creatures called via a ''[[planar binding]]''.

Later, their spells could more easily penetrate the defenses of any outsider, thanks to the demonbinders long study of such creatures and the sureness of their magic.

At their pinnacle, a demonbinder's destructive spells bore a baleful energy, with half of it coming from infernal power that could not be resisted by other magic. Their ''[[flame strike]]'' was even entirely infernal power and could not be resisted at all.

==Notable Nar Demonbinders==
* [[Clymph]], thought to be a Nar demonbinder, builder of the demon-infested [[Clymph Tower]] in the [[Rawlinswood]] of the [[Great Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|888}}, and slain by his demons two years later.
* [[Jesanta Beril]], a Nar demonbinder and cleric to [[Talona]] both, she learned the ancient ways of the demonbinders from the [[Balor]] [[Fareeansis]] that wandered the [[Cold Lands]] under the guise of a sage called Benedict.{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Jesanta Beril}}
