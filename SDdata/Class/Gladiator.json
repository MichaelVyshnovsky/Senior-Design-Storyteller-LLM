        "mainbody": "A '''gladiator''' was a warrior that fought other creatures for the amusement of others,",
        "Activities": "Gladiators spent much of their lives in arenas and coliseums, sport fighting for great throngs of adoring fans.",
        "Culture": "While some gladiators were in control of their own destiny, others fought as slaves to benefit and garner wealth for others.\n\nMany of them were considered just as much entertainers as they were warriors, utilizing bold and extravagant combat maneuvers that were just as deadly as they were thrilling to watch.",
        "Abilities": "Gladiators were adept at sizing up their opponents and gaining insight about their fighting prowess by observing their movements. They could use this knowledge to their benefit but tiring out their foes, gaining an advantage, and delivering a vicious ''coup de grace'' to the roar of the enthralled audience. \n\nSome gladiators were known to utilize underhanded and \"dirty\" fighting tricks like coating their weapons in [[poison]], inflicting wounds that bled profusely, and even throwing sand or dirt in the face of an opponent. Using their performing abilities, some even took the tactic of pretending they were mortally wounded, only to turn around and score a hit on their foe.",
        "Possessions": "Some gladiators preferred to hone their skill with less-traditional weapons, such as the [[cestus]]. Despite the fact they fought on land in arenas, gladiators often trained themselves in the use of [[net]]s and [[trident]]s.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], gladiatorial arenas could be found in the [[Moonsea]] city of [[Hillsfar]];<ref name=Moonsea\"> [[Calimshan]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]], the city-state of [[Reth]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]], various locales the [[Dragon Coast]] and perhaps most famously, all across the unforgiving realm of [[Thay]] in the [[Unapproachable East]]. \n\n[[Tharchion]]s of Thay employed gladiators from many different races, along with monstrous beasts and other fantastic creatures. Due to their size and strength [[goliath]]s made perfect gladiators. Slavers were known to steal goliath infants and raise them as brutal fighters for the arena.{{Cite_dragon/386/Winning_Races:_Goliath_Giants_of_War}}\n\nWhile gladiatorial contests were forbidden in many other civilized lands during the late 15{{th}} century, as of [[1479 DR]] they remained popular in [[Calimport]], where the [[Pasha]] [[Marod el Arhapan]] held a large number of games in a floating arena. The frontier merchant-city of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] also maintained a dedicated arena around that time, and small-scale underground fighting pits were not unheard of, such as that found within\nthe [[Black Blade and Bloody Boar]] in [[Mulmaster]].{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|8}}",
        "Notable Gladiators": "* [[Garmult]], proprietor of [[Garmult's House of Mastery]] in [[Baldur's Gate]].\n* [[Hamsetis]], the former gladiator-slave of the [[Red Wizards]] that devoted himself to the deity [[Set]].\n* [[Jekk Ironfist]], a [[shield dwarf|dwarven]] gladiator of [[Hillsfar]] that relocated to the town of [[Daggerford]].\n* [[Werrik Bonehand]], the [[grimlock]] gladiator that fought in the [[duergar]] city of [[Drik Hargunen]] in the [[Darklands]]."
