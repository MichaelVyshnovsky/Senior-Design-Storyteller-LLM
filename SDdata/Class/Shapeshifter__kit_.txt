'''Shapeshifters''' were a variety of [[druid]]s that forwent the versatility of [[wild shaping]] in favor of embracing [[lycanthropy]], usually of the [[werewolf]] variety, and specializing in the transformation that came with that condition.{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn Game Manual|88}}

==Culture==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], shapeshifter druids could be found in [[Faerûn]] across the [[Sword Coast]], all the way up to the [[Icewind Dale]] region, as well as in [[west Faerûn]] in the nations of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]].

==Abilities==
Unlike others afflicted with lycanthropy, shapeshifters had complete control over the condition, having undergone a series of intense study and training to master it.

==Combat==
A shapeshifter druid typically fought with either [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[sling]]s, [[spear]]s, or [[staves]]. They forwent armor of any kind and would only wield [[buckler]]s or [[shield]]s not fashioned from metal.

==Notable Shapeshifters==
* [[Cernd]], a high-ranking [[human]] shapeshifter that traveled throughout the [[Lands of Intrigue]] during the mid–14{{th}} century DR.<ref>{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn Game Manual|56}}
* [[Voltinabulai]], an [[elf]] shapeshifter that lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR.
