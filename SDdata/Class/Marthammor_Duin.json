The young '''Finder-of-Trails''' approached life with a [[gnome]]-like demeanor, curious to see what lay beyond the horizon and the '''Watcher over Wanderers''' was always willing to trade stories of travels. His was the rare spirit of dwarven exploration, and the spark of curiosity his followers associated with bursts of lightning.\n\nOn worlds besides [[Toril]], Marthammor was often referred to as '''Muamman Duathal''', and some in the Realms still worshiped him under this name.",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "When appearing before dwarves on the [[material plane]], Marthammor was known to take the form of either a glowing blue-white disembodied hand, a glowing [[mace]], or a glowing [[magic mouth]], depending upon the situation."
        },
        "Divine Realm": "Marthammor was said to reside in the Cavern of Rest beneath [[Nidavellir]], though was rarely found there as he spent most his time traveling across the northern regions of Faer√ªn. His home was guarded by the souls of dwarves who had perished\nwhile traveling the surface, as well as by [[boar]]s and [[war dog]]s that he had trained himself.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Marthammor symbol.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Symbol of Marthammor.]]\nOther members of the dwarven pantheon saw Marthammor's behavior as 'antics' and hoped his interest in the world above would soon pass. [[Moradin]] was grateful that at least his youngest son was more disciplined than [[Dugmaren]], one of Marthammor's greatest friends.\n\nHe hated the gods of [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s and [[giant]]s and held special enmity for the [[hill giant]] god [[Grolantor]].",
