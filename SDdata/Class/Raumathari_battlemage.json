        "mainbody": "Raumathari battlemages were the elite war-minded spellcasters of ancient Raumathar, an empire that rose and fell over a millennium before the 14 century DR.\nThese battlemages considered themselves to be the enemies of ancient Narfell and the demonic forces with which they cavorted.\nAll battlemages were required to attune themself to a single sword, using it as a focus rather than some other implement. This ritual took three days to perform, and required material components upwards of 1,000 gp in value.\nThis extra effort was rewarded with a unique power. Raumathari battlemages could in effect channel certain memorized spells through their sword as they struck down foes in battle. A creature struck by the weapon was also struck by the effects of the channeled spell, so long as they did not resist the effects.\nThey could also apply metamagic effects to their spells at a rapid pace, without extending the duration of a spells casting time.\nIn the final conflict between Raumathar and Narfell, the battlemages led the efforts to destroy the Narfelli capital of Val-Murthag.\nThere were few practitioners of Raumathari battlemagic in the millennia following the collapse of the great eastern empire."
