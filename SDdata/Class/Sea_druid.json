        "mainbody": "Sea druids were specialty priests devoted to Deep Sashelas, the Lord of the Undersea.\nAll sea druids were aquatic elves, half-sea elves, or malenti.\nThey were resistant against lightning-based attacks. They spoke many of the languages of other sea creatures including koalinths, merfolk, sahuagin, etc. They were immune to any charm spell cast by other seafolk. Sea druids could shapechange into any normal-sized fish, sea reptile, or sea mammal three times per day.\nSea druids wielded tridents, nets, spears, daggers, or knives. For armor they wore either sea elven scale mail or sea elven shell mail."
