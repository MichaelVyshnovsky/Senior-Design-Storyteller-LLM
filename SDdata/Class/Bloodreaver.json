        "mainbody": "Bloodreavers were specialty priests devoted to Garagos, the god of war and destruction.\nAs with all worshipers of Garagos, bloodreavers were mortal enemies of anyone associated with Tempus. They attacked and slaughtered Tempus followers whenever they could.\nBloodreavers were completely immune to any kind of magic attempting to command them or take control of their mind. Spells such as taunt, forget, suggestion, domination, geas, demand, succor, enthrall, quest, and exaction were useless against them. They were also immune to magic items that affected the targets emotions or loyalties. However, they found it particularly difficult to resist the effects of a philter of love or philter of persuasiveness.\nBloodreavers could incite a berserker rage within themselves on a daily basis. While raging, the bloodreaver was more easily able to strike and harm their enemies and often got the jump on their opponents during combat. These rages lasted for a full ten minutes. The intensity of the berserker rage was so high that if the bloodreaver ran out of enemies to attack while raging, they would turn on their comrades and attack the nearest person until their rage ended.\nThese individuals were extremely hearty and healthy. They gained the following spells as they progressed through the ranks chaotic combat, blood mantle, and whirlwind of steel. Spells from the combat sphere cast by higher ranking bloodreavers were twice as potent as normal.\nGaragos used to grant bloodreavers the blade barrier and an enhanced prayer ability during the time of ancient Netheril, but these powers had not been granted since Garagos demotion to that of a demigod.\nUnlike priests of other faiths, bloodreavers could wield any kind of weapon and wear any kind of armor. Their armor was of the highest quality, but often marred from frequent use during battle. Bloodreavers wore red gloves and boots and crimson capes. High priests typically wore rubies shaped to look like drops of blood. All bloodreavers proudly displayed the tentacus, the holy symbol of Garagos, on their person."
