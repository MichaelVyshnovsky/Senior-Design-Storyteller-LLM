Skyweavers were specialty priestesses devoted to Isis, the Lady of All Love within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Skyweavers helped oversee agricultural production on farms, particularly during planting time. Their magic was often used to induce favorable weather conditions for such purposes.
All skyweavers were human or half-elf women of Mulhorandi descent. With regards to half-elves, their elven heritage was required to be from either moon elves or gold elves.
Skyweavers were both wizards and priests, making them skilled in both arcane and divine magic. They could be specialist in any schoool of magic save necromancy. They could all cast southern magic spells via the use of the read southern magic spell. Skyweavers possessed an innate resistance to magic that grew as their skills increased. They could cast dispel magic, air walk, magical vestment, and control weather once per day, and charm person and regenerate once per tenday.
In addition to any blunt weapons, skyweavers often carried a dagger, knife, darts, a net, or lasso. Skyweavers did not wear armor or use a shield.
