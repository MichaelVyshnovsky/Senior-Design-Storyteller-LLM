'''Skyweavers''' were [[specialty priestess]]es devoted to [[Isis]], the Lady of All Love within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Activities==
Skyweavers helped oversee agricultural production on farms, particularly during planting time. Their [[magic]] was often used to induce favorable weather conditions for such purposes.

All skyweavers were [[human]] or [[half-elf]] women of [[Mulhorandi]] descent. With regards to half-elves, their [[elven]] heritage was required to be from either [[moon elves]] or [[gold elves]].

==Abilities==
Skyweavers were both [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s, making them skilled in both [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic]]. They could be specialist in any schoool of magic save [[necromancy]]. They could all cast [[southern magic]] [[spell]]s via the use of the ''[[read southern magic]]'' spell. Skyweavers possessed an innate resistance to magic that grew as their skills increased. They could cast ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[air walk]]'', ''[[magical vestment]]'', and ''[[control weather]]'' once per day, and ''[[charm person]]'' and ''[[regenerate]]'' once per tenday.

==Possessions==
In addition to any blunt weapons, skyweavers often carried a [[dagger]], [[knife]], [[dart]]s, a [[net]], or [[lasso]]. Skyweavers did not wear [[armor]] or use a [[shield]].
