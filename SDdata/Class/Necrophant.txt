'''Necrophants''' were specialty priests devoted to [[Velsharoon]], the Archmage of [[Necromancy]].

==Activities==
Most necrophants spent the majority of their time in pursuit of necromantic research, creating hundreds of [[undead]] servants in the process. Necrophants often branded a worthless undead creation with Velsharoon's symbol and sent the creature to wander the world. Low-ranking necrophants often helped cure disease and illness in communities in order to raise funds for the [[Church of Velsharoon|church]].

==Abilities==
Given their specialization in necromancy, necrophants were quite knowledgeable with regards to anatomy and [[necrology]], the lore of undead creatures. Their knowledge of anatomy was useful when harvesting organs or body parts for specific [[spell]]s and treating diseases.

One of a necrophants most useful abilities was casting both [[Divine magic|divine]] and [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spells related to necromancy, providing a degree of expertise far beyond the typical wizardly or priestly [[necromancer]]. Necrophants did not memorize their wizard spells. Instead they prayed for arcane necromancy spells just as they did for divine ones. Necrophants were always able to read and use necromancy spells from [[scroll]]s or [[spellbook]]s as if they cast ''[[read magic]]''.

Initiate Necrophants could cast ''[[chill touch]]'' and ''[[speak with dead]]'' once per day. Mid-ranking necrophants could cast ''[[spectral hand]]'' and ''[[animate dead]]'' once per day. High-ranking necrophants could cast ''[[wraithform]]'' and ''[[energy drain]]'' once per day, and they could also assume [[gaseous form]] once per day.

==Possessions==
Necrophants carried bludgeoning weapons and did not wear [[armor]].
