        "Strength is as much a function of the mind as one's body. Train hard and think craftily in preparation for war, for all life is an endless battle.\n|An excerpt from the doctrine of Ilneval.\n}}": "=Description==",
        "mainbody": "neval appeared as a confident and seemingly war-wise, yet perpetually unsmiling, {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}} tall orc. His face and arms were marred heavily by battle scars that only increased his appeal to his orcish followers.",
        "Description": "Ilneval appeared as a confident and seemingly war-wise, yet perpetually unsmiling, {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}} tall orc. His face and arms were marred heavily by battle scars that only increased his appeal to his orcish followers.",
        "Personality": "Bold and direct, Ilneval was a daring leader that charged headfirst into battle with only the destruction of his opposition and triumph over his adversaries on his mind. He was a take-charge figure of inspiring bravery that loathed cowardice and underhandedness, but was not, as one might assume, an unthinking brute.\n\nIndeed, Ilneval was actually a devious strategist, but his careful plans were made before the battle to maximize his odds of success and ensure he inflicted as much damage on the enemy as possible. He was both self-serving and ambitious, preferring to plan the conquest to come rather than reminisce on victories past.",
        "Powers": "Ilneval was nearly as strong as the incredibly powerful [[Bahgtru]], and his [[avatar]] was immune to non-magical weaponry. It could also use [[cleric]]al magic and cast ''[[domination]]'' three times per day.",
        "Possessions": "Ilneval's dreadful [[broadsword]] was enchanted, and caused profuse bleeding in those it struck unless magic on or above the level of ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' was applied. There was a chance that any non-orc it hit would be instantly slain.\n\nThe War Maker also wore an enchanted suit of red, iron [[chainmail]] that deflected all missile weapons including arrows, bolts, and ray-form spells or spell-like abilities, though it was possible that enchanted missile weapons could harm him.",
        "Realm": "The orc pantheon was known to move between the planes in their war against the [[goblinoid pantheon]]. At one point they went from the [[Nine Hells]] to [[Acheron]], with Ilneval inhabiting a smaller block orbiting the cube of [[Nishrek]].\n\nIn the [[World Tree]] cosmology, where Nishrek was its own realm (a twisted natural landscape marred by carnage and warped to fit orc ideals), Ilneval dwelt within [[Gruumsh]]'s [[Iron Fortress]].",
        "Activities": "Ilneval's role in the orc pantheon was that of the captain, the master commander (next to Gruumsh)Â who devised the tactics and stratagems that allowed orcs to dominate the battlefield and fill their war wagons with gore and treasure. Ilneval was called upon to lead Gruumsh's forces when the One-Eyed God lacked the time, or otherwise did not wish to do so himself, and the Crafty Warrior only sent an avatar at his superior's command, and only when the battle was important.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Others": "Though he had his differences with his fellows in the orc pantheon, Ilneval hated the goblinoid gods, [[Morndinsamman]], [[Seldarine]], and all their other traditional enemies, and would never betray his race as a whole.\n\nIlneval's [[proxy]] was the half-orc warrior known as General [[Guldrin Blut]]."
        },
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Ilneval taught his followers to train hard and think smart to prepare for the unending battle that was life. It was their duty to unite the tribe into a raging storm that could attack as one, using the strength found in numbers to triumph. Nonetheless, when combat began, they were to charge into the fray and let the blood fall as it would. Ilneval's own courage inspired great loyalty, and only through personal courage would one prove themselves worthy of leadership.",
            "Rituals": "Clerics and adepts of Ilneval prayed for their spells at dusk to prepare for the battle of the upcoming night. Their holy days were before and after battle, but they had only a few besides token rituals of obeisance to honor Gruumsh, a calculated show of fealty by the Crafty Warrior. The clergy's most sacred celebration was an annual raid on [[Greengrass]], when the clerics of the War Maker gathered hordes of orcs to descend upon the civilized world and destroy all in their path. Sacrifices to Ilneval could be performed anywhere and consisted of blood and weapons."
        },
        "History": "Near the end of the [[Orcgate Wars]], Ilneval fought against the leader of the [[Untheric pantheon]], [[Gilgeam]], before [[Tiamat]] used the situation to launch an ambush against the God-king. The [[Unther]]ic aspect of [[Bahamut]] known as [[Marduk]] managed to defeat Tiamat before she could land a killing blow, though at the cost of his own life."
