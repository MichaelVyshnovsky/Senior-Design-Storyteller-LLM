        "Activities": "A healer provided healing services to those within their village. Most of their time was spent dealing with minor sicknesses and assisting with childbirth. They usually avoided combat at all costs as it went against their nature. The exception to this was usually in self defense.",
        "Culture": "Each individual healer held to beliefs that many found to be strange. Examples included never eating meat when the sun was showing, never killing harmless animals, or always entering a room with the same foot. Healers developed more of these behaviorial nuances as they developed.",
        "Abilities": "Healers were completely immune to all known poisons. They could [[turn undead]] like normal [[priest]]s.",
        "Possessions": "A turquoise and [[copper]] pendant was the healer's badge of status. They carried a variety of [[herb]]s and ointments used to combat disease."
