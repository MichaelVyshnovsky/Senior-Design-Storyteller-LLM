        "mainbody": "Healers were kindly individuals who tended the sick and injured among the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin.\nA healer provided healing services to those within their village. Most of their time was spent dealing with minor sicknesses and assisting with childbirth. They usually avoided combat at all costs as it went against their nature. The exception to this was usually in self defense.\nEach individual healer held to beliefs that many found to be strange. Examples included never eating meat when the sun was showing, never killing harmless animals, or always entering a room with the same foot. Healers developed more of these behaviorial nuances as they developed.\nHealers were completely immune to all known poisons. They could turn undead like normal priests.\nA turquoise and copper pendant was the healers badge of status. They carried a variety of herbs and ointments used to combat disease."
