        "mainbody": "A nightrunner was a specialty priest of the Church of Mask who specialized in operating within wilderness environments and dungeons.\nNightrunners were commonly associated with adventurers where they could exhibit how Masks blessings were useful even outside of settled areas.\nThey did not hide the fact that they were priests of Mask. Nightrunners were usually confident and extremely opportunistic.\nMany of their abilities were parallel to skilled thieves, including their awareness of their surroundings, their ability to backstab enemies, climb, move about in silence, and remain hidden.\nA nightrunner could only turn weaker undead.\nThey typically wore leather armor and dressed like normal adventurers. Nightrunners wielded any weapon appropriate for a common thief. Their sacred dagger, which also served as their holy symbol, was stamped on the bottom of the hilt with the symbol of Mask."
