        "mainbody": "Lashers were martial combatants that devoted themselves to mastery over whips above all other weapons, learning to wield them as though they were extensions of their body.\nThe life of a lasher was typically taken up by barbarians, fighters, rangers, as well as some former druids and paladins. It was also seen as an attractive path by some bards, monks, and rogues.\nLashers delighted in showing off their skills, considering the use of whips to be as much of an art form as it was a martial art.\nLashers were such masters in the art of whips that they could use them to grab or interact with far away objects or even disarm their foes. The most skilled of lashers had such a transcendent understanding of whips that they gained a supernatural power to rapidly whirl their weapon above their heads, incapacitating foes within a  radius.\nDue to their proficiency with wielding whips, lashers often had skills in leatherworking and in the proper usage of ropes.\n* Sardak, an expert half-elf lasher and bandit leader who wielded both a +3 keen sweeping mighty whip dagger and a masterwork whip."
