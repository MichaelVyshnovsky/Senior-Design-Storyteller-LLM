        "mainbody": "Mercenary barbarians were a special type of warrior found in Zakhara. In some ways they were the counterparts to mamluks. Mercenary barbarian was a 2nd edition warrior class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.\nThere were no special requirements for mercenary barbarians, but all hailed from the hills, jungle, or plains.\nThose who didnt have slave warriors (mamluks) often hired mercenary barbarians to do their fighting for them. As such, these warriors were considered a necessary evil. These warriors were awkward when associating with anyone not of their homeland. They were often strong fighters, but not as adept at fighting as a single unit as mamluks were.\nMercenary barbarians had an unlimited amount of choice when selecting their equipment, as long as their purse could back up their selections.\nThese warriors were especially intimidating toward other human or humanoid natives of Zakhara.\nTheir bad reputation hindered these warriors when dealing with all not from their native homeland."
