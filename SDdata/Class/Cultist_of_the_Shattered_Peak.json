        "mainbody": "A Cultist of the Shattered Peak was a member of the Cult of the Shattered Peak, a secret society whose members were all of Netherese descent.\nCultists were always humans of Netherese descent.  These bloodlines are most prevalent in the Anauroch Desert, Halruaa, Nimbral, on the Sword Coast North, in the Ride, among the Uthgardt, and in the Western Heartlands.\nMost members were originally fighter/rogues, though single-class rogues and rogue/rangers have also been known to join the cults ranks.  Paladins are rare due to the cults sometimes ruthless tactics, and arcane spellcasters are banned altogether. They were also required to speak Loross.\nThe cultists recalled the arcane hubris that was Netherils downfall, not to mention its oppression of nonhumans, and fought to keep the old ways dead and buried. Their goal was to prevent Netherese secrets from being rediscovered, in the hopes of protecting Toril from suffering a similar apocalypse. To this end they employed a myriad of tactics ranging from disinformation and theft to outright assassination.\nCultists normally favored stealth and guile over direct combat, but when forced they attack with ferocity and efficiency.  Their prowess was equivalent to a rogue, and they struck fast and hard, preferably before their target realized that the cultist is there.  Their special abilities, particularly the Death Attack (see below) make such surprise attacks devastating.\nSpellcasting  Cultists gained the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells from the schools of abjuration and enchantment.\nOminous Presence  Cultists had a knack for lying and intimidation which was useful for dissuading adventurers from uncovering dangerous Netherese secrets.\nZeal  Cultists had a boost in morale when fighting arcane spellcasters.\nSneak Attack  Like rogues, cultists could stab opponents in the back with lethal force.\nSmite Mage  Like paladins, cultists could smash through enemy defenses.\nDeath Attack  Like assassins, cultists could instantly kill rival combatants.\nCultists were proficient with many deadly weapons, wore light armor, and used bucklers in combat.\nCategoryPrestige classes\na4gal07vpbgmsp0vr2248auy9yhwnks"
