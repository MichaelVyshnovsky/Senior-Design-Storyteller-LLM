At the end of the great Procession, most of Tyr's archon warriors had been slain or banished, but he was successful in destroying [[Valigan]], a god of anarchy, and by this time, Tyr was committed to inspiring justice on Toril as a whole. Torm joined them to complete the Triad some years later.\n\nHowever, the faith of Tyr did not become a dominant one in Faerûn until shortly before the establishment of the [[Standing Stone]], when most of the other members of the pantheon were already well-established in their roles, but after some 1,600 years since the Procession of Justice, Tyr successfully had become known over all of Faerûn.\n\nTyr lost his right hand to [[Kezef the Chaos Hound]],{{Cite polyhedron/118/Forgotten Deities: Dendar; Kezef|20-21}}{{Cite web/Bane of the Gods: The Elder Eternal Evils of the Forgotten Realms}} in a test of his honor and strength of will.

They would lift the ban on him if he could escape from chains forged for him by [[Gond]]. Kezef insisted that if this were truly a fair challenge then Tyr must be willing to place his right hand into the elder evil's mouth. Tyr agreed. Kezef was enchained, the chain was anchored deep in [[Cocytus]] in [[Pandemonium]], and [[Mystra]] placed an enchantment to prevent the chain from ever being severed. Furious, Kezef bit off Tyr's hand. It was said that he feasted on the god's hand, drawing power from it, for centuries. (Among the [[Asgard]]ians, the story of the loss of Tyr's hand was similar but involved the members of the Aesir and the entity Fenris Wolf instead.{{Loss of Tyr's hand}})\n\n[[File:Tyr - comics.jpg|thumb|right|233px|''The god Tyr holding the [[Claw of Malar]] and standing over the cowering [[Pasha]] [[Abon Duum]].'']]\n\nAt some point, the conman [[Conner]] made a deal with Tyr: he promised to bring the god the ''[[Claw of Malar]]'', (which was then in the possession of the tyrannical crime-lord [[Pasha]] [[Abon Duum]],) in exchange for some unknown service, debt, or crime. Finally, in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, emboldened by Conner's apparent death, Abon Duum used the power of the [[Catlord (old)|Catlord]] to travel to Tyr's realm in [[Gladsheim]] to confront Tyr with the ''Claw of Malar'', apparently seeking to seize the power of the gods. However, \"Tyr\" was revealed to be Conner in a cloak, having faked his death and been spirited to Gladsheim. The Catlord stole the ''Claw of Malar'' and passed it to Conner, before the real Tyr appeared and took the artifact. With a warning that he would keep an eye on Conner and the scales of justice, he sent the heroes home, while Duum was left to face Justice himself.{{Cite comic/The Last Betrayal|10-14}}\n\n===Time of Troubles===\nAt the onset of the [[Time of Troubles]], Tyr's eyes were put out by [[Lord Ao]] for failing to notice the theft of the [[Tablets of Fate]] and for questioning the justice of Ao's response. Ilmater, true to his ethos, worked to teach Tyr to live with his blindness and to rely upon his feelings instead,<ref> though in truth they were not a great hindrance in view of his power as a greater god.\n\n===The Spellplague===\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, shortly before the catastrophic events of the [[Spellplague]], Tyr and [[Siamorphe]], who then dwelt in the House of the Triad, had a great disagreement over a battle between [[Tethyr]]ian and Calishite forces. The argument was so severe that Siamorphe left the House of the Triad to make her realm with [[Sune]] in [[Brightwater]]. Tyr sent [[Helm]] as a messenger to Sune to explain his position, and Sune tried to act as a peacemaker. As the goddess of love, she proposed a marriage between Tyr and [[Tymora]] as a way to restore balance to the [[Celestial Planes]]. Tyr agreed and began a formal courtship with the goddess of good fortune.\n\nIt was suspected that [[Cyric]] plotted to corrupt the arrangement, for rumors came to Tyr that Helm, who had been delivering messages from the House of the Triad to Brightwater for Tyr, had been having a secret affair with Tymora and that she loved the god of guardians instead of the god of justice. Tyr believed that the only way to reach the truth of the matter was to challenge Helm to a duel, and Helm felt that it was the honorable act to accept the challenge.\n\nIn the duel that followed, Helm was slain, leading to more chaos in the Celestial realms. Heartbroken, Tymora left Brightwater to be with Tyr out of duty, but Ilmater left the Triad and accepted Sune's invitation to Brightwater.\n\nMore tragedy among the gods shortly followed. In the next year, [[1385 DR]], Cyric teamed with [[Shar]] to bring about the death of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] and the resulting [[Spellplague]]. At least this event brought Sune and Tyr onto the same side again, and the two of them, with Lanthander's aid, pursued and captured Cyric, imprisoning him for a sentence of one thousand years.\n\nAfter imprisoning Cyric, Tyr abdicated his godhood and granted Torm all his deific power, because the Even-Handed had lost faith in himself and in his ability to lead and judge. Tyr counseled all of his followers to offer their allegiance to Torm. Tyr's portfolio of justice was subsequently absorbed by [[Bahamut]], who later became a subservient deity of Torm.{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|92}}\n\nAt some point, Tyr sent the [[deva]] [[Ayrx]] into [[Undermountain]] to try and talk sense into [[Fazrian]]. Unfortunately, [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]] was able to capture Aryx, and trapped her in a shield in his [[Mad Wizard's Lair|Lair]].\n\n===Death===\nAt some point between 1385 DR and [[1479 DR]], Tyr died fighting off a [[demon]]ic invasion of the upper realms in an act of heroic sacrifice. Tyr's absence reinforced the role of Torm as the new master of Celestia.\n\n===Resurrection===\nTyr managed to return to life during the event known as the [[Second Sundering]], in the 1480s DR.",
        "Description": "[[File:Tyr p196-Glen Angus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A depiction of Tyr from other worlds, incorrectly showing his left hand missing.'']]\nTyr was portrayed as blind or with a bloody bandage over his eyes and missing his right hand, and he did not try to hide or bandage his stump. He usually was shown as a burly, noble warrior with a powerful build and a bearded face.\n\nWhen an [[avatar]] of Tyr appeared to his followers, his eyes (or eye) were at first the color of bright steel, but they faded away to empty sockets before the avatar vanished. His brow always shone with a white radiance or halo, leaving no doubt as to his divine nature.\n\nTyr was often shown wielding a powerful magic sword or [[warhammer]] and dressed in light armor or [[chainmail]].",
        "Personality": "Tyr was strong-spirited and noble. He was primarily concerned with the punishment of wrong-doers and the general furthering of law and good in the world. Tyr hated duplicity, trickery, rule-breaking, and wanton destruction. He likewise hated lies and the breaking of oaths and was disgusted by persons who earned from such things. For his own part, he never would break a promise.\n\nTyr urged the establishment of moral and ethical codes for sentient beings in all lands.\n\nTyr was a fair judge, but he was hard to understand to those outside his faith, as they more readily perceived him as a stern and rigid punisher. On the other hand, he was seen as a brave father-figure to his followers. In truth, he was well aware that a lawful utopia would never be possible in the imperfect [[Prime Material plane|Material Plane]], yet this did not stop him from trying to make the world a better place for his mortal followers. He wanted his followers to see themselves as a \"perfect family\", not made of perfect individuals but rather of members who ''tried'' and wanted to be perfect, who acted out of trust, courage, and love toward each other. His knowledge that such a dream would never be achieved among the mortal realm filled him with genuine sadness.\n\nTyr was at first more willing than many other gods to manifest in some form or other to his followers, because of his fierce feelings of fatherly protection toward them. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], however, Tyr had tired of appearing in the Realms and began limiting his appearances to cases with important repercussions that were not obvious to mortals.\n\nBesides his avatar, Tyr might send an intelligent [[war dog]] as a representative, or he might use a resounding gong, a choir of male voices, or a floating warhammer to express his will. The colors blue, white, and purple were considered sacred to his followers.",
        "Powers": "Tyr was said to be able to instantly perceive any thief coming near him and to [[See invisibility|see invisible objects and persons]]. He could create magical items that also bore such powers. He always knew anyone's moral and ethical viewpoint and could [[Discern lies|detect any lies]]. Tyr was immune to all illusions, fear, or magics affecting one's emotions.\n\nIf casting magic, Tyr never used damaging [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]] spells. His spells from the [[law sphere]] were three times as powerful as normal.\n\nTyr was powerful enough to grant his clerics their spells even if they traveled to another [[crystal sphere]]. However, not all deities were powerful enough to do this, and if one of his clerics found her- or himself in the presence of a cleric of one of these lesser powers, Tyr would only grant spells of the same power as those granted by the other weaker cleric. He did this out of a sense of fairness.\n\nAs god of justice, Tyr could foretell any injustice up to six months before it occurred and felt the pang of that injustice for six months afterward.",
        "Possessions": "Tyr's [[longsword]] was named [[Justicar (sword)|''Justicar'']]. It was said to have been a gift either from Tyr's predecessor or from [[Lord Ao]] himself. It was crafted with the aid of [[Mystra]]. Tyr's warhammer was especially disrupting to [[undead]].",
        "Divine Realm": "Within the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Tyr had his [[divine realm]] called [[the Court]] on [[Lunia]], the first of the [[Mount Celestia|Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia]]. He also still considered [[Asgard]] on the [[Ysgard (layer)|first layer]] of [[Ysgard]] his home, the joint realm of most of the Norse pantheon. In the [[World Tree cosmology]], the Court was located on a mountain surrounding Mount Celestia, one of three mountains each held by each member of the Triad. In that cosmology, all ''four'' mountains were considered the [[House of the Triad]].",
        "Activities": "In the [[divine realm]] of [[Asgard]], Tyr was responsible for ensuring that only the most valiant of warriors were permitted access to the great hall of [[Valhalla]].",
        "Relationships": "[[File:The Triad.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The members of [[the Triad]]: Tyr, supporting [[Ilmater]], follows behind [[Torm]].'']]\nTyr was said to be the son of the god [[Odin]] and his wife Frigga.\n\nTyr was the head of the group of deities known as the Triad. The two other gods who made up the Triad were [[Ilmater]] and [[Torm]].\n\nAmong the greater deities of Faerûn, Tyr was the only one of [[lawful good]] alignment. Along with the Triad, Tyr was close to [[Lathander]]. He opposed the deities [[Bane]], [[Bhaal]], [[Cyric]], [[Mask]], [[Talona]], and [[Talos]].\n\nTyr gave great respect to [[Zaphkiel]] and the archons of Mount Celestia, but it was not believed that he had authority over them.",

            "Early History": "As the only lawful member of the Norse pantheon, Tyr faded largely from prominence. For this reason, he sought a means of strengthening his power by obtaining worshipers from other worlds. He chose the crystal sphere of [[Realmspace]] and submitted himself to the authority of the overgod Ao.\n\nThe first recorded instance of Tyr on Toril was in the [[Lake of Steam region]], ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-2600}}. A warrior known as [[Belaros]] and a group of priests were said to have met with Tyr in person in the mountains near the northern border of [[Turmish]]. In response, Belaros crafted the mighty [[artifact]], the ''[[Balance of Belaros]]''.\n\nFor at least 5,000 years of Faerûnian history, Tyr also seemed to appear under other names—'''Achanatyr''', '''Iltyr the Blind but All-Seeing Eye''', '''Arrtyr Judge of All''', and Anachtyr, among others. Under one of these names, he was a member of [[Jhaamdathan pantheon]] before that empire's fall.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2014)/Tyr's ancient past}}<!--per Ed on Patreon and Discord, he was a member of the Coramshite? (Calsihite Nine) as Anachtyr, and was *not* the same entity as the Norse Tyr-->\n\nIn Calimshan, Anachtyr had been worshiped for far longer than Tyr had been in other parts of Faerûn. Among the Calishites, religious legends suggested that the god who was Tyr passed on his portfolio to another at the end of each millennium, and that Anachtyr was actually an earlier Tyr who passed his portfolio on to the Norse newcomer.",

Tyr counseled all of his followers to offer their allegiance to Torm. Tyr's portfolio of justice was subsequently absorbed by [[Bahamut]], who later became a subservient deity of Torm.{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|92}}\n\nAt some point, Tyr sent the [[deva]] [[Ayrx]] into [[Undermountain]] to try and talk sense into [[Fazrian]]. Unfortunately, [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]] was able to capture Aryx, and trapped her in a shield in his [[Mad Wizard's Lair|Lair]].",
            "Death": "At some point between 1385 DR and [[1479 DR]], Tyr died fighting off a [[demon]]ic invasion of the upper realms in an act of heroic sacrifice. Tyr's absence reinforced the role of Torm as the new master of Celestia.",
            "Resurrection": "Tyr managed to return to life during the event known as the [[Second Sundering]], in the 1480s DR."

        "Rumors": "One of the many ancient aspects of Tyr, Iltyr the Blind but All-Seeing Eye, was still being venerated in secret, even after Tyr's death after the Spellplague. This ancient cult involved a number of [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] and [[Cormyr]]ian nobles and even included some [[beholder]] and [[elven]] followers. Iltyr was depicted as an entirely black, flying, weeping eyeball with a prehensile tail. Iltyr's hidden shrines, however, often included large portraits that included one or a pair of large but normal staring eyes, which his followers often dismissed to visitors as the only surviving portrait of an ancestor. Iltyr supposedly communicated with followers with a booming, telepathic voice.\n\nSome suggested that Tyr invented the concept of trial by combat."
