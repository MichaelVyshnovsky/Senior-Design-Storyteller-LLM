        "mainbody": "ighthunters were specialty priests devoted to Set, the Lord of Evil within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nNighthunters participated in countless schemes and plans designed to undermine the authorities and other gods in Mulhorand.\nAll nighthunters were humans or half-orcs of Mulhorandi lineage. They kept their heads clean shaven.\nThey were quite stealthy and able to sneak up on targets and stab them in the back like an assassin. They radiated protection from good, 10 radius and were permanently masked by an undetectable lie. They were skilled at crafting deadly poisons and eventually became immune to all poisons. All nighthunters could see well in the dark. Their sinister reputation gathered like-minded individuals to serve them. Nighthunters could cast summon divine minion once per day. Particularly powerful nighthunters could coat any held weapon with lethal poison on touch.\nIn addition to any blunt weapons, a nighthunter could carry a dagger, darts, longbow, blowgun, khopesh, scimitar, spear, or whip. They did not have armor restrictions."
