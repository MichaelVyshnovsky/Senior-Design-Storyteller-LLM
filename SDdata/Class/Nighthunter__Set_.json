        "Activities": "Nighthunters participated in countless schemes and plans designed to undermine the authorities and other [[god]]s in [[Mulhorand]].",
        "Culture": "All nighthunters were [[human]]s or [[half-orc]]s of [[Mulhorandi]] lineage. They kept their heads clean shaven.",
        "Abilities": "They were quite stealthy and able to sneak up on targets and stab them in the back like an [[assassin]]. They radiated ''[[protection from good, 10' radius]]'' and were permanently masked by an ''[[undetectable lie]]''. They were skilled at crafting deadly [[poison]]s and eventually became immune to all poisons. All nighthunters could see well in the dark. Their sinister reputation gathered like-minded individuals to serve them. Nighthunters could cast ''[[summon divine minion]]'' once per day. Particularly powerful nighthunters could coat any held weapon with lethal poison on touch.",
        "Possessions": "In addition to any blunt weapons, a nighthunter could carry a [[dagger]], [[dart]]s, [[longbow]], [[blowgun]], [[khopesh]], [[scimitar]], [[spear]], or [[whip]]. They did not have [[armor]] restrictions."
