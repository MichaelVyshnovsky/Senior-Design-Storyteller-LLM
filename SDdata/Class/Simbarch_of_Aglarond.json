        "mainbody": "The simbarchs of Aglarond were elite wizards of the late 15 century DR who took their inspiration and principal teachings from the Simbul, the former Witch Queen of Aglarond. They held a prominent place in Aglarondan society of the time, effectively forming the ruling class of the nation.\nWhile she was ruler of Aglarond, the Simbul took on apprentice mages and taught them the art of using magic, while also passing on magical secrets of her own. Having reigned well over a century, in time she had many apprentices, and they later had apprentices of their own. her former apprentices made an effort to preserve her knowledge and techniques and took on new apprentices of their own. They called themselves \"simbarchs\" in honor of their departed master.\nFrom the Simbuls former palace in Veltalar, fifteen simbarchs ruled Aglarond as the Simbarch Council.\nAs of 1489 DR, the Simbarch Council had softened its militant stance toward Thay.\nThe simbarchs of Aglarond were often like the Simbul herself compassionate and restrained individuals who, nonetheless, when provoked, hurled their magic with a recklessness that terrified their foes.\nAny simbarch had the right to petition to take a seat on the Simbarch Council. This involved taking on many significant responsibilities and engaging in politics, and it could take months or years before one was formally recognized and accepted. However, not all simbarchs were councilors, and these others preferred to study and practice their arts privately. They operated independently, often as adventurers.\nSimbarchs had a vitality unusual to wizards, using their magical power to fuel their health and endurance. They could find fresh reserves of energy more often and in tight circumstances, and eventually, even when hurt, their determination carried them through more strongly.\nIn particular, they learned to wield a form of silver fire. In one foundational spell, called simply silver fire, they could summon a jet of silver fire that would blast a target creature, burn out their defenses, and bolster their subsequent spells against them. Next, with the synostodweomer spell, they could use this silver fire to heal themselves or another up to  away.\nWith the Simbuls tempest spell, they could not only produce a storm of telekinetic energy to assault their foes over a  area, but also envelop themselves in silver fire to cleanse themselves of debilitating spells and effects."
