More experienced horn guards could also cast ''[[bless]]'', ''[[create food and water]]'', ''[[efficacious monster ward]]'' and ''[[wyvern watch]]''. The most powerful horn guards could additionally cast ''[[animal growth]]'', ''[[heroes' feast]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'' and ''[[restoration]]''. In addition, they gained the natural immunity to paralyzation and fear-based spells and effects.\n\nThe most powerful horn guards could naturally shapechange. They could only assume the form of terrestrial mammals who did not live in trees and burrowing animals. While shapechanged they could not bestow healing on themself or anyone else."
