        "mainbody": "Avengers were druids that had witnessed a significant defilement of nature\nAvengers were fanatical or obsessive in their quest to carry out vengeance upon those who defiled nature, not bothering to explain or justify their actions to others.\nA grim demeanor was characteristic of most avengers, with bitterness and often misanthropy coloring their worldview as a result of the experience that drove them to become one. Many refrained from taking on companions, such as hirelings and mercenaries, until much later in their life. This grimness also made them rather silent individuals, rarely speaking more than was necessary to humans and most demihumans, though they were open to conversing with animals and intelligent races of the wilderness, such as wood elves.\nSuch druids lived nomadic lives and disliked remaining in one place for too long, actively traveling in search of wrongs to right and injustices to avenge. all the way up to the Icewind Dale region, as well as in west Faer√ªn in the nations of Amn\nAvengers were often skilled in the arts of hunting, tracking, and training animals, as well as in general lore about animals, setting snares, herbalism, and weaponsmithing.\nThey differed from other druids in their wild shape forms and spell selection, which were gained through undergoing intense training and an extensive series of rituals that were physically draining.. In addition to traditional forms like a bear or wolf, avengers could wild shape into a salamander, a sword spider, and a baby wyvern. And in addition to typical druidic spells, avengers gradually gained access to six arcane spells chain lightning, chaos, chromatic orb, improved invisibility, lightning bolt, and web. Notably, their version of chain lighting could penetrate through magic resistances.\nWhile avengers were proficient in the same manner of weaponry as other druids, the two they most often preferred were the scimitar and spear. They typically dressed in leather armor, studded leather, or hide armor."
