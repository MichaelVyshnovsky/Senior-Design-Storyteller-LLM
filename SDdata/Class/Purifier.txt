'''Purifiers''' were specialty [[priest]]s of the [[Church of Cyric]] who were established after the [[Cyrinishad]] incident and were tasked by the [[Cyric|Prince of Lies]] to cleanse his church of members who were not fully commited to the Dark Sun.<ref name="WaPotR-p73" >

==Activities==
In addition to purifying the church, purifiers were also tasked with slaying any followers of non-evil gods in an attempt to reduce the power of Cyric's counterparts.

==Culture==
Purifiers were highly intelligent followers who believed Cyric was the one true god. They did not shy away from violence when it was necessary.

==Abilities==
A purifier could animate a skull that had the intelligence of the purifier. The skull lasted for many hours depending on the skill of the purifier. The skull hovered near its creator and was capable of biting targets or emitting an ear-piercing shriek that could ''[[confusion|confuse]]'' anyone who heard it. A purifier could create one of these skulls per week.

Purifiers were unable to cast [[spell]]s from the [[healing sphere]].

==Possessions==
A purifier's robes were deep black with crimson streaks. They wore [[silver]] [[bracer]]s at their wrists and a silver circlet adorned with a skull and black sun. They wielded a decorated [[footman's mace]] in combat.

==Relationships==
Purifiers were not welcome within [[Zhentil Keep]] and were attacked outright if they approached too close to the city.
