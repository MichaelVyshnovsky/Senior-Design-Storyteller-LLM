}}'''Ragarran priests''' were specialized [[outland priest]]s who worshiped the savage [[Zakhara]]n goddess [[Ragarra]].{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|13}}<ref group="note">Ragarran priest was a [[cleric]] class kit for the [[Al-Qadim]] setting.

==Requirements==
Though males could certainly become Ragarran priests, the hierarchy was dominated by females. Similarly most Ragarran priests were [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] though other races were represented to a lesser effect as well.

==Role==
The primary role of all Ragarran priests was to increase the power and worship of their goddess. This task was of the utmost importance as of [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} since the followers of Ragarra had diminished greatly since the rise of the empire of [[Kadar]].{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|12}}

Ragarran priests were most powerful and comfortable within the jungle, but the need to recruit more followers drove them toward the more civilized lands of the [[Cities of the Ancients]]. Ragarran priests despised civilization and used their unique powers to destroy all aspects of it whenever possible.

==Possessions==
Since Ragarra made no restrictions in the shedding of blood, her priests were allowed to carry and use bladed weapons. Most Ragarran priests wore light armor and some even carried a shield.

==Benefits==
All Ragarran priests were quite adept in the art of disguise, a skill which suited their role well when infiltrating civilization. Their inherent roguish nature also made them more skilled with weaponry commonly used by [[thief|thieves]] when compared to priests of other religions.

Since Ragarra was a goddess closely bound with nature, all of her priests could pass through any natural surrounding without leaving a trace.

Ragarran priests could speak with animals for extended periods of time when in natural surroundings, similar to the ''[[speak with animals|spell]]'', on a daily basis.

Ragarran priests could summon and command [[bat]]s and [[crocodile]]s when in the jungle or other forests. Once summoned, these creatures followed the priest for a full day.

More powerful priests could summon and command [[giant crocodile]]s or [[mobat]]s.

Ragarra also granted her priests access to several unique spells.

The strongest of Ragarra's priests could undertake a special ceremony where they were transformed into powerful creatures known as [[greater segarran]]s.

==Hindrances==
The very nature of Ragarra demanded that all of her followers be evil individuals.
