        "Culture": "The vast majority of luckmaidens were [[shield dwarves]] or [[gold dwarves]], but female members of all of the [[dwarf]] races could become a luckmaiden.",
        "Abilities": "Luckmaidens were skilled weaponsmiths. Haela Brightaxe blessed her luckmaidens so they had a stronger chance of resisting the effects of [[spell]]s and other such attacks during combat. Their practice with weaponry allowed them to strike more often during combat, similar to a warrior.\n\nIn addition to their normal [[spell]]s, luckmaidens could cast ''[[Mage armor|armor]]'', ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'', ''[[aid]]'', ''[[strength]]'', ''[[draw upon holy might]]'', ''[[lighten load]]'', ''[[Prayer (spell)|prayer]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[heal]]'', and ''[[heroes' feast]]'' on a daily basis. Furthermore, they could ''[[detect weapons]]'' at will.",
        "Possessions": "Luckmaidens did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the [[armor]] they were allowed to wear."
