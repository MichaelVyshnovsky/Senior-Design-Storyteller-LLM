Serphidians were specialty priests devoted to Sseth, the World Serpent.
Serphidians spent much of their time hunting or courting government officials to widen their sphere of corruption.
These individuals were always humans, ophidians, spirit nagas, yuan-ti (with the exception of histachii), or any other reptilian race. Regardless of their race, all serphidians eyes became slitted like a snake as soon as they joined the priesthood.
Serphidians were immune to every type of reptilian venom. They also gained immunity to all poisons as they progressed through the ranks. Serphidians also enjoyed a variety of magical abilities including speak with reptiles, sleep, sticks to snakes, snake skin, animal summoning II, and vipergout. Particularly powerful serphidians could shapechange into a giant constrictor snake, boalisk, or amphisbaena.
Serphidians typically wore scale mail. They were not restricted in the type of weapons they could wield.
