        "based": "William Shakespeare's [[wikipedia:en:Titania|Titania]]",
        "histrefs": "",
        "mainbody": "'''Titania''' (also known as '''Tiandra'''",
        "Description": "Titania appeared as an [[eladrin]] of immense beauty. Her skin was the color of honey and her hair shimmered in all of the colors of autumn leaves. Her eyes glowed with gold like the sun.\n\nAlternatively, her [[avatar]] would appear as a small but beautiful gossamer-winged [[Fey|fairie]] with flawless, pale skin and immaculate cheekbones and gray-blue eyes.",
        "Personality": "Titania was hard to classify personality-wise. She seemed flighty and frivolous to some, but in truth she was a brilliant strategist both in court and on a battlefield. She had a dry sense of humor and could be very pragmatic when needed. It was almost impossible to make her angry, but if a truly despicable act roused her ire, the perpetrator would be faced with the most powerful wrath!\n\nTitania was amused by mortals and had been known to take some as lovers.",
        "Powers": "Titania's very smile could cause crops to ripen, and her frown could trigger wildfires. Her gaze could cause mortals to go mad.\n\nTitania's avatar shared a number of innate magical powers in common with the other sylvan gods. Her avatar was immune to paralysis, all illusions and mind-affecting magics, and [[symbol]]s and [[power word]]s and could only be harmed by enchanted weapons. She was able to immediately recognize pure water, [[Locate animals or plants|all animals and plants]], and [[Detect poison|poisons]]. She had great [[charm]]ing powers, including the ability to place a [[geas]] on any creature to never enter sylvan lands. Titania could [[summon]] woodland creatures or [[Summon swarm|swarms of critters]] to her aid. With a simple wave of her hand, she could [[entangle]] foes with any nearby vegetation.",
        "Possessions": "Titania always carried a [[diamond]]-tipped wand, and her avatar fought with a magic [[dagger]]. Compared to her innate powers, the dagger was mostly decorative, but the wand was a ''[[staff of power]]'' that glowed as a ''[[gem of brilliance]]'' and surrounded her with a [[magic circle against evil]]. The wand could also [[create food and water]] or a [[Heroes' feast|feast fit for heroes]]. It could also [[purify food and drink]].",
        "Divine Realm": "The Seelie Court was also the name of Titania's [[Divine realm|realm]]. It had no permanent location but instead wandered from plane to plane, from the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] to [[Arborea]] to [[Ysgard]].\n\nThe realm was one of the most beautiful places in existence, and time flowed differently there.\n\nTitania's palace was [[Senaliesse]], where she held her [[Summer Court]]. Her throne room was overflowing with flowers, water fountains, and fine silks, and [[Sprite (classification)|faeries]] flitted all about. Mortal bards and playwrights often performed for her.\n\nTitania's throne was ornately carved from ice in the shape of a [[dragon]]. (It was a mirror of the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]]'s throne, except that that one was made of darkness and shadow.) The throne was in fact a magical [[construct]] that could serve as a guardian if needed.",
        "Activities": "Titania watched over all fey beings, be they [[dryad]]s, [[pixie]]s, [[satyr]]s, [[treant]]s, [[unicorn]]s, or any of the other nearly countless varieties, desiring that all such creatures could someday live in utter joy.\n\nWhen the Seelie Court met, Titania's avatar was always present and almost always accompanied by at least one other member of the Inner Circle of the Court. All faeries knew when and where the Court would be meeting.\n\nIf harm ever came to faerie lands, Titania would not hesitate to send her avatar to intervene.",
        "Relationships": "Titania had a famous love affair with [[Oberon]], the Green Lord, and it was he who built her palace. Some even called the couple husband and wife, while admitting that both took other lovers freely. At other times, they were also great enemies; at still other times, they were both lover and foe at the same time.\n\n[[Damh]], the god of satyrs and [[korred]]s, was seen as Titania and Oberon's son. [[Verenestra]], the goddess of dryads, was considered Titania's daughter. The [[Prince of Frost]] was also a son of Titania.<ref>{{Cite dragon/374/Court of Stars: The Prince of Frost}}\n\nThe so-called \"Inner Circle\" of sylvan gods respected Titania as their queen and deferred to her in matters of judgment. [[Skerrit]], god of [[centaur]]s, and other \"Outer Circle\" gods did not follow Titania's rule, but she had great love for them and their worshipers nonetheless.\n\nThe [[Seldarine]] were on good terms with Queen Titania and were willing to aid her whenever she requested it of them.\n\nThe Queen of Air and Darkness was rumored to be the dark sister of Titania. Whatever the truth, Titania refused to wage open war against the evil queen and instead grieved for her.\n\n[[Noble eladrin]] infused with the power of summer served as her barons.\n\nTitania's niece, Lady Shandria, governed [[Astrazalian]], the City of Starlight in the Feywild.",
        "Worshipers": "Titania was worshiped by a plethora of non-evil fey beings. [[Brownie]]s, [[booka]]s, pixies, and [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]] considered her their patron deity. Titania, like other sylvan gods, did not grant spells to her followers, nor did she have priests or [[cleric]]s, for all fey creatures had magical powers of their own.\n\nTitania's followers taught that she was a goddess of goodness and mercy. They saw her as a mother figure. Her [[holy symbol]] was a white diamond with a blue star.",
        "History": "Periodically, Titania hosted a parliament of all the separate fey courts—[[Seelie Court|seelie]] and [[Unseelie Court|unseelie]]—at Senaliesse, which was sometimes called the [[Court of Stars (Feywild)|Court of Stars]].\n\nTitania was a [[archfey patron|patron]] to many [[warlock]]s in the Realms."
