'''Garl Glittergold''' ({{Pronounce|garl|refs=}}), also known as '''The Watchful Protector''', was a [[lawful good]] [[greater deity]] of [[gnome]]s. Garl led the [[Lords of the Golden Hills]] as the [[deity]] of luck, protection and trickery.
{{Quote|Most splendiferous, gregarious, and overall duplicitous of Gods (especially for the gnomes who embody those attributes quite cheerfully) is Garl Glittergold.|The introduction to ''[[Gnomefather]]'', a book featuring Garl Glittergold}}
==Relationships==
Aside from the other non-[[evil]] members of the gnomish pantheon, Garl was allied with [[Yondalla]], [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Moradin]]. His main companion was his intelligent battleaxe, [[Arumdina|Arumdina the Justifier]].

Garl's tendency to jest with the various deities worshiped by the creatures and monsters of the [[Underdark]] resulted in him garnering many enemies, but chief among them was the [[kobold]] god, [[Kurtulmak]].

==Worshipers==
{{Quote|Grant me but a fraction of thy wit, sire. It is all one could need.|A basic prayer.}}
Garl was the most popular of the gnomish deities, and honored, in one way or another, by nearly all gnomes. His [[cleric]]s, known as Glitterbrights, wore war helms and gold belts. 

===Rituals===
On the 13{{th}} day of each month, the Forgotten Folk held the [[Communion of Laughter]] in his honor. It consisted of joke-telling contests, communal meals, dancing, prayers, and storytelling, and donations of [[gold]], which Garl's church used to the benefit of the entire community.

==History==
According to legend, Garl Glittergold was exploring underground when he found a new cavern, and inside, a new peopleâ€”the gnomes. He told them a joke and then led them out into the wider world.

According to legend, Garl let himself be captured by Kurtulmak, only to escape and cause the entire roof of Kurtulmak's cavern to fall on his head.
