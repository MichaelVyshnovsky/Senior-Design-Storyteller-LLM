'''Odin All-Father''' was the leader of the [[Norse pantheon]] of [[Asgard]], and the supposed father of [[Tyr]], god of justice of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]].

==Description==
Odin typically appeared as an older man with a bald head and a long gray beard. He wore a patch over one eye and a gray [[tunic]] under a hooded [[cloak]] of blue. His [[avatar]] often was seen wearing a slouch hat.

==Abilities==
Odin was an immensely powerful entity. He could take any shape or form desired. In combat, his presence instilled allied warriors with [[Barbarian|beserker]] [[rage]]. If angry, Odin's gaze would [[paralyze]] his foes. He also shared the abilities of [[bard]]s, [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, and [[Wizard|mages]].

Odin also had two strange weaknesses. He could not directly [[Raise dead|raise the dead]], and if he ever used his deific powers to heal, he fell into a deep sleep for several days.

==Personality==
The All-Father was a proud god, stern, and brave. Two of the only acts that his worshipers could do that would truly anger him were to help a [[giant]] or to lose a battle.

Odin's moral outlook was [[Neutral good|good]], with a balance of [[lawful good|law]] and [[Chaotic good|liberality]], though he sometimes leaned more toward the side of chaos.

==Possessions==
[[File:Odin2e.png|thumb|right|250px|''Odin All-Father riding into battle upon his steed Sleipnir, with his two wolves Freke and Gere at his side.'']]
Odin wore a magic [[breastplate]] and helmet in battle and bore a great spear named ''Gungnir'', which always pointed toward the most powerful opponent in any battle. He also fought with a massive [[longbow]] and utilized a golden [[Wand|magic wand]] covered in runes.

Odin wore a magical ring, ''Draupnir''. Every night, if he so desired, he could use the ring to create a duplicate. While not magical, these duplicates were valued between 3,000 and 30,000 [[gold piece]]s, and Odin offered them as rewards to servants who pleased him. 

==Divine Realm==
The All-Father ruled from Asgard, home of the Norse pantheon, on the plane of [[Ysgard]]. He claimed three separate halls there as his realm, Valaskialf, [[Valhalla]], and [[Gladsheim (hall)|Gladsheim]]. Valaskialf was the seat of his all-seeing throne Hlidskialf, from which he could observe anywhere in the multiverse. Valhalla served as his council chambers, while Gladsheim was his feasting hall.

==Activities==
On occasion, Odin would disguise himself as an old man, riding upon a mangy horse, and visit the worlds of his followers to see how they fared in person.

When he grew bored, Odin would sometimes travel to the [[Lower planes]]—sometimes accompanied by his son Thor and daughter-in-law Sif—with a horde of [[valkerie]]s and [[einheriar]] to shake things up amongst the [[fiend]]s involved in the [[Blood War]].

==Worshipers==
[[File:Odin holy symbol.png|thumb|right]]
The only known [[Temple of Odin|site of worship]] to Odin in [[Realmspace]] was on the worldlet of the [[Rock of Bral]], among the [[Tears of Selûne]] orbiting [[Toril]]. By the end of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Odin had about 100 worshipers there, almost enough to elevate him to the level of [[demipower]] in that [[crystal sphere]]. On other worlds, most of Odin's priests were tribal chieftains.

Odin's holy symbol was a watching blue eye. His worshipers were never evil creatures. They saw their god as ruling over battles, knowledge, poetry, and wisdom.

==Relationships==
Odin was said by some religious scholars to be the father of Tyr by his wife Frigga, and indeed, he was believed by his worshipers from other worlds to have fathered most of the gods of the Norse pantheon.

Odin kept a pair of [[wolves]], a pair of [[raven]]s, and an eight-legged [[horse]] as companions. His giant black wolves were named Freke and Gere, and they traveled the [[planes of existence]] to keep Odin informed. His ravens were sent as his messengers and spies and were named Hugin and Munin. Sleipnir was the name of his mighty steed, who carried him into battle.

==History==
As a deity from another crystal sphere, the mythology and legends surrounding Odin's actions on the [[Material Plane]] have little bearing on the history of the worlds of Realmspace.<ref group="note">Most of the lore provided for Odin is very focused on real-world Norse myths with references to Midgard and do not match with the cosmology presented by the [[Planescape Campaign Setting]], much less that of the Forgotten Realms. As such, it would simply not be fitting to record it on this wiki. It was said, however, that his missing eye was traded for a drink from the Well of Knowledge.
