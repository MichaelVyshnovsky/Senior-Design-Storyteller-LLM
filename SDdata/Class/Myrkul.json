            "Mortal Life": "As a mortal, Myrkul's full name and title was said to have been ''Myrkul Bey al-Kursi'', Crown Prince of [[Murghôm]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|80}} He was a powerful adventuring [[necromancer]], traveling with Bane and Bhaal during his mortal years ''circa'' the [[Shadowed Age]] of ancient [[Netheril]], each dedicated to a quest to attain divinity for themselves. The trio scoured the Realms for power and information to get closer to godhood, and eventually managed to slay one of the [[Seven Lost Gods]] in the {{YearlinkName|-357}}. That year they led a coalition of forces drawn from the [[Moonsea North]], and slew [[Maram of the Great Spear]] at the [[Monument of the Ancients]] in the [[Frozen Forest]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}} Having gained some [[divine]] power, they embarked into the [[Gray Waste]], and after slaying legions of [[undead]], stood before the Lord of the End of Everything, [[Jergal]].\n\nThe ancient god had grown tired of his reign and freely agreed to hand over his dominion of the underworld. As the three could not decide who among them would sit upon the throne of the dead, they left the decision to chance with a game of [[knucklebones]]. Bane emerged the winner and declared himself \"ruler for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant\". Myrkul had come in second place and his decision seemed to out-maneuver the Black Lord.\n\nSo Myrkul ascended, or rather descended, as the ''Lord of the Dead'', ruler of the [[Hades|underworld]].",
            "Betrayer's Crusade": "{{Fq|text=Death walks behind each of us, every day. Nay, don't look back nor try to run—none can outrun his fate, though many try strange and elaborate ways of doing so.

It's the way of Death.|source=[[Oren Bel Danarr]], Sage of Triel, ''Musings on the Realms''<ref>{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|95}}}}\nWhen the [[Rashemen]] city of [[Mulsantir]] was ravaged by a plague known as the [[Black Whisper]], only two [[priest]]s, both of them faithful to Myrkul, were willing and able to tend [[Rashemi]] that died within the streets. As a rare symbol of recompense, the Lord of the Dead retrieved the ''[[Silver Sword of Gith]]'' from the [[Abyss]] and presented it to his follower, [[Akachi]]. Myrkul anointed him as his [[chosen]] and directed him to continue his teachings in Faerûn.\n\nWhen Akachi's [[faithless]] [[founder|lover]] died in an accidental [[arcane]] backfire, the priest knew her soul would be lost to the [[Wall of the Faithless]] in the [[City of Judgement]]. He begged Myrkul to spare her from this fate, but the Lord of Bones refused. Filled with anger and sorrow, Akachi renounced his god, and along with his brother [[Araman]], assembled group to [[Betrayer's Crusade|march on the City of Judgement]] by means of the [[Betrayer's Gate]], tear down the wall and retrieve his beloved.\n\nAkachi's crusaders were met on the [[Fugue Plane]] by Myrkul himself, who led an army comprised of ancient heroes, a horde of [[devil]]s from the Abyss and those judged to have broken oaths with their deities. During the ensuing battle, Myrkul broke through Akachi's forces and had the former Chosen bound in chains and dragged to the [[basilica]] to face judgement. He was denounced as one of [[false|\"the False\"]], and rather than be banished to the City of Judgement,  was cursed to roam Faerûn as the ''faceless man'', an abomination with an insatiable hunger for the souls of others that became known as the [[Spirit-Eater]]. Myrkul handed down this punishment as a sort of contingency plan that ensured the people of Toril would always fear his name.",
            "Time of Troubles": "Many years later, Myrkul again allied himself with Bane and the two dark gods conspired to steal the [[Tablets of Fate]] from the overgod [[Ao]], in hopes that the loss of these tablets would weaken him enough that he could be overthrown. In response, the gods were banished from their respective Realms, forced to live on Toril in [[avatar]]s that held a mere fraction of their divine power.\n\nSometime in the first half of the year [[1358 DR]], the gods appeared in the Realm of Faerûn. While it was unclear where Myrkul first turned up, at one point he traveled to the [[Goldenfields]], a temple dedicated to the Earthmother [[Chauntea]], where he fought the High Priest [[Tolgar Anuvien]]. Myrkul was stopped from destroying the temple outright, but he left Anuvien dying on the ground after their battle.\n\nOn [[Eleasis 13]], Myrkul assisted Bane with their continued pursuit of the tablets and had his clergy work to create and cast a mass-scale ''[[death spell]]'' that, by use of their true names, killed all of the [[assassin]]s throughout Faerûn. These souls were consumed by Bane and his worshipers in an ultimately futile attempt for the Black Lord to assault the [[Temple of Torm's Coming]] in the city of [[Tantras]], where one of the tablets rested under guard.\n\n[[File:Servants of Myrkul.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''The undead host of Myrkul riding through the streets of Waterdeep.'']]\nIt was unknown exactly when, but Myrkul learned of the location of the other Tablet of Fate and recovered it to his realm, the Great Waste. Remaining in his realm with his tablet, Myrkul sent his [[night rider]]s to intercept the mortal [[Midnight]] at [[High Horn (hold)|High Horn]], as he knew her to be in possession of the other divine artifact.\n\nAfter Midnight and her companions arrived at [[Waterdeep]], Myrkul followed from Hades through the [[Pool of Loss]] beneath the [[Yawning Portal]] inn. He rode through the city with a horde of undead and [[fiend]]ish minions, finding Midnight, her allies and the remaining Tablet of Fate taking refuge in [[Blackstaff Tower]]. He briefly reunited the two divine slabs and ascended the spire towards the [[Celestial Stairway]]. A magnificent battle ensued on the tower's roof, and when the Lord of Bones was distracted by a swooping [[griffon]] he was ''[[disintegrate]]d'' by the young mage whom he had been pursuing. The avatar of Myrkul was destroyed in an eruption of plague and death. Some of the dust from this explosion drifted far to the north and came to rest in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] southeast of [[Neverwinter]], causing outbreaks of [[undead]] from ancient battles in the area.{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, \"the Black Death\"}}",
            "Crown of Horns": "As Myrkul's avatar was slain, just before the majority of his power was transferred to Cyric during his ascension, the last remnants of his energy entered into the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', which was locked away within a vault inside [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben \"Blackstaff\"'s]] tower. The ancient [[Netherese]] artifact held what was left of his personality and memories for a decade, after which it reformed its physical form on Toril. By Myrkul's lingering will, the crown transported around Faerûn to a number of hosts, allowing the god to maintain his influence among the mortals, as he ever did, sowing dissent and fear via suggestion and influence. Among those that wore the crown were [[Aumvor|Aumvor \"the Undying\"]] and the [[Yuan-ti pureblood]], [[Nhyris D'Hothek]].",
            "Third Crusade of the Faithless": "[[File:Dead Power Myrkul.jpg|thumb|250px|''Myrkul as a Dead Power.'']]\nIn [[1374 DR]], while escaping from the [[Academy of Shapers and Binders]] in [[Thay]], the [[Kalach-Cha]] passed through a portal to the [[Astral Plane]] and happened upon Myrkul's corpse, spending some time conversing with the nearly-dead god on the nature of the Spirit-Eater curse.",

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Lord of Bones' [[Chosen]], [[Ketheric Thorm]], sacrificed himself to Myrkul in a last-ditch effort to defeat a party of [[True Soul]] [[adventurer]]s who had pursued him beneath [[Moonrise Towers]], resulting in Ketheric being resurrected as an avatar of Myrkul.\n{{quote|''I am the smile of the worm-cleansed skull.
