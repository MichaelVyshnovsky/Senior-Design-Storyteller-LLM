        "mainbody": "Necrophants were specialty priests devoted to Velsharoon, the Archmage of Necromancy.\nMost necrophants spent the majority of their time in pursuit of necromantic research, creating hundreds of undead servants in the process. Necrophants often branded a worthless undead creation with Velsharoons symbol and sent the creature to wander the world. Low-ranking necrophants often helped cure disease and illness in communities in order to raise funds for the church.\nGiven their specialization in necromancy, necrophants were quite knowledgeable with regards to anatomy and necrology, the lore of undead creatures. Their knowledge of anatomy was useful when harvesting organs or body parts for specific spells and treating diseases.\nOne of a necrophants most useful abilities was casting both divine and arcane spells related to necromancy, providing a degree of expertise far beyond the typical wizardly or priestly necromancer. Necrophants did not memorize their wizard spells. Instead they prayed for arcane necromancy spells just as they did for divine ones. Necrophants were always able to read and use necromancy spells from scrolls or spellbooks as if they cast read magic.\nInitiate Necrophants could cast chill touch and speak with dead once per day. Mid-ranking necrophants could cast spectral hand and animate dead once per day. High-ranking necrophants could cast wraithform and energy drain once per day, and they could also assume gaseous form once per day.\nNecrophants carried bludgeoning weapons and did not wear armor."
