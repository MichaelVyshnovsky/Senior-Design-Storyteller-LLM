        "mainbody": "Father of the DanceThe Horned DancerThe Horned Leaper\nTapann was the patron deity of korreds. His symbol was a laughing mouth.\nTapann appeared as a six-foot-tall male korred, carrying a cudgel. He wore a rough tunic made from the hide of a bear or owlbear and a belt with pouches containing his own hair, a pair of silver shears, and vials of holy water.\nTapann was said in some myths to have fathered the goddess Shiallia, thanks to a brief dalliance with the dwarven goddess Sharindlar.\nTapann brought dead korreds of unusual bravery to Limbo with him to be his personal servants. Some of this servants were named Jambul, Hrressek, Tishlun, and Bresk. All korreds obeyed Tapann or his servants without question.\nTapanns realm on the plane of Limbo was a hill studded with standing stones. However, he spent most of his time on the Prime Material Plane.\nTapann was worshiped by korreds.\nTapann had no shamans or clerics, and did not grant spells to his followers.\nEvery seven days (or more often, if they were requesting or thanking Tapann for his aid), korreds gathered in a circle in a glade, hilltop, clearing, or ring of standing stones. There, they beat drums and played the bone-flute, slowly working themselves into a wild frenzy. This ritual literally drained the life from the korreds. Aged and mortally injured korreds might seek to literally dance themselves to death. They might even force captives to dance along with them, and even more of their life was drained than that of the korreds, although other fey lost no more life than the korreds. This life-force was sent to Tapann as an offering."
