'''Profitprophets''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Waukeen]] who preached about the [[Waukeen|Golden Lady's]] return while also undertaking sucessful business ventures. In reality, [[Lliira]] was the one answering the profitprophets' prayers.<ref name="WaPotR-p89" >

==Activities==
Profitprophets did everyting in their power to keep Waukeen's traditions alive. They spent much of their time and money investing in business opportunities.

==Culture==
Waukeen's faithful profitprophets refused to accept that Lliira was granting their [[spell]]s.

==Abilities==
Profitprophets were skilled in determining the quality of [[gemstone]]s, making it easy for them to spot a fake. They were also extremely accurate to within 5% when estimating the value of any item or service. Profitprophets could [[turn undead]].

==Possessions==
These [[priest]]s dressed in the finest clothes with the hopes of showing others that Waukeen's graces were still strong.

==Relationships==
Palpable friction existed between the profitprophets and the [[Church of Lliira]] after the Joybringer's faithful assumed control of the Church of Waukeen and the rest of her clergy. This tension often lead to outbreaks of violence even in public places.
