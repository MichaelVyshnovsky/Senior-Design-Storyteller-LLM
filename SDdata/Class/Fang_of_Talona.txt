'''Fangs''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Talona]] who worshiped the [[Talona|Lady of Poison]] through both healing and harming.<ref name="WaPotR-p110" >

==Activities==
Fangs used disease and poisons to harm others, but also used their abilities to make antidotes and heal as well.

==Culture==
Most fangs voluntarily scarred their faces and covered their bodies in tattoos to honor Talona. Fangs laced their words with veiled threats, taking advantage of their goddess' aura of fear in order to further their goals.

==Abilities==
Given their close work with poisons and venoms, fangs were better able to resist their effects. These substances also took longer to affect a fang, giving them more time to prepare an antidote. All fangs were skilled at brewing poisons and their appropriate antidotes using specific methods which developed over time.

Fangs were immune to all diseases both normal and magical, save for [[lycanthropy]]. They could also ''[[Remove disease|cure]]'' disease in other several times per week.

They were slow to engage in normal combat, preferring instead to backstab or use poison. Fangs could not [[turn undead]]. They also found the [[undead]] to be especially disgusting since their poisons had no effect on them, making them much more awkward if forced to combat any form on undead with weapons.

==Possessions==
Fangs dressed in drab olive-colored clothing. A black chain worn around their neck bore their [[holy symbol]]. [[Leather armor]] was the only [[armor]] they would consider wearing, and this was always dyed green or black. They preferred using weapons that were easy to use with poison including [[dart]]s, [[blowpipe]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[short sword]]s.
