        "mainbody": "'''Nomog-Geaya''' was the [[hobgoblin]] [[god]] of warfare and authoritarianism, an iron-fisted deity who handled matters of militant conquest in the [[goblinoid pantheon]]. Powerful warrior and dangerous warlord, Nomog-Geaya was an oppressive entity that brought pain to both his patron race and their enemies, whether on or off the battlefield.",
        "Description": "Nomog-Geaya appeared as a powerful, {{SI|10|ft}} tall hobgoblin with rough, ash-gray skin, cold, orange eyes, and [[shark]]-like teeth.",
        "Personality": "Nomog-Geaya exemplified the traits associated with and admired by hobgoblins; he was brutal and pitiless but also stoic and courageous. The only expression he was ever stated to display was that of a grim despot with a stiff upper lip, his dour countenance remaining unchanged even when injured. He was quiet, speaking only when something had to be said, a part of why he was said to be one of the greatest commanders of the [[plane]]s. He was disgusted by weakness and cowardice yet he was not unbearably egotistical, being aware of his own capabilities and able to recognize greater authorities.\n\nDespite having some considerably noble traits however, the merciless general was still the Torturer, a sadistic entity said to have mastered the art of pain. He was a fairly unpleasant individual to be around with such unsavory habits as consuming the cooked flesh of vanquished foes.",
        "Powers": "Of [[Maglubiyet]]'s servants, Nomog-Geaya was likely the most powerful in terms of individual might, one of the toughest among them and immune to strength-draining magic. Befitting a god that promoted fearlessness and ferocity, he was also immune to magic that sowed terror and despair.",
        "Possessions": "Nomog-Geaya's iconic weapons were his [[broadsword]] and handaxe with which he slashed his enemies with astonishing speed. Both were enchanted but while the broadsword possessed the [[wounding]] property, the handaxe inflicted those it struck with an effect similar to a ''[[symbol of pain]]''.",
        "Divine Realm": "Like most of the [[goblinoid]] [[pantheon]], Nomog-Geaya dwelt on the first layer of [[Acheron]], [[Avalas]], on the goblin barracks of the planes that was the floating metal cube of [[Clangor]]. He supposedly commanded his hobgoblins to settle a giant mesa known as [[Redspike]], turning it into a giant tower to serve as their greatest city in Clangor.",
        "Activities": "Nomog-Geaya was Maglubiyet's war general, responsible for leading the goblinoid legions, although he was particularly responsible for and interested in ensuring the survival, expansion and continued discipline of the hobgoblin race.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Subordinates": "Often portrayed as his second-in-command, the goblinoid god [[Bargrivyek]] was one that incited hatred and revulsion, albeit thinly constrained, from Nomog-Geaya for his relative weakness and cowardly demeanor. The Peacekeeper, as he was called, was terrified of Nomog-Geaya's wrath, leaping to fulfill his every order to avoid it, none of which helped improve the image the General had of him. Though he would quickly destroy him if given the chance and would have placed someone else in his position if he could, Bargrivyek was the only hobgoblin deity left after Maglubiyet's murder of the rest of the hobgoblin pantheon, and even if he could find a replacement, Bargrivyek's position was secure so long as Maglubiyet sanctioned it.\n\nBut while Bargrivyek had earned Nomog-Geaya's contempt, it was the god below the Peacekeeper, [[Khurgorbaeyag]], that was the General's true rival, a being he also regarded with barely contained disgust. Leaders of the goblins and hobgoblins respectively, Khurgorbaeyag competed with Nomog-Geaya to earn Maglubiyet's favor, so it fell to Bargrivyek to play diplomat between these forces."
        },
        "Worshipers": {
            "Rituals and Duties": "Once per year at [[midwinter]] in underground temples, hobgoblins were known to conduct mass torture rituals on non-hobgoblins. Nomog-Geaya's priests took part in various other ceremonies and rituals imitating the General, such as officiating gristly after-battle feasts where they consumed their cooked enemies.\n\nThe priests of Nomog-Geaya were no less dangerous in terms of martial skill than mundane counterparts, trained in the combined use of longswords and axes (either handaxes or battleaxes). They typically donned iron or steel armor, normally [[banded mail]], and with all but their eyes covered by great helmets. Their magic was frequently used to harm rather than heal, with them gaining access to spells like ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'' or ''[[symbol of pain]]'', as well as dominating spells such as ''[[command]]''.\n\nNomog-Geaya sent his [[avatar]]s to deal with matters regarding the discipline of hobgoblins, but it was possible to manipulate them into conflicting with goblins. Otherwise, he sent omens in the form of involuntary phrases, uttered by the torture victims of his hobgoblin priests. The favored animal of Nomog-Geaya was the carnivorous [[ape]], it being considered a compliment to \"fight like an ape\", implying great savagery. The bright, glossy red that was the holy color of Nomog-Geaya, as one would expect, represented blood."
        },
        "History": "While there was once an entire pantheon of hobgoblin gods, Maglubiyet massacred the rest, so long ago that their names had been lost to time, and Nomog-Geaya and Bargrivyek were the only ones to remain.\n\n''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-3400}}, hobgoblins and their dwarven slaves constructed a [[Idol of Nomog-Geaya|gigantic statue to Nomog-Geaya]], in the [[Gorge of Nomog-Geaya the Warrior]], at the mouth of the [[River Ith]]. The gorge became a gathering place for hobgoblin tribes for three centuries. The idol was destroyed in {{Yearlink|-1931}} by [[Calimshan|Calishite]] armies."
