        "mainbody": "Alaghor were specialty priests devoted to Clangeddin Silverbeard, the Father of Battle.\nThe vast majority of alaghor were either gold dwarves or shield dwarves, but members of all of the dwarf races, both males and females, could become an alaghar.\nAlaghar possessed superior skills with weapons, similar to warriors. They practiced their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat. An alaghar could pour all of their energy into a devastating swing of their weapon once per day.\nIn addition to their normal spells, alaghar could cast command, spiritual hammer, strength, strength of one, defensive harmony, axe storm of Clangeddin, and blade barrier on a daily basis. They could also detect magic at will.\nAlaghor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the armor they could wear. Many favored the battle axe."
