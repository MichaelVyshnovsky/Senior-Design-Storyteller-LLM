'''Vecna''' ({{Pronounce|VEK|nah|refs= While he was once considered the most powerful lich to dwell on that world,{{Cite dragon/225/Three Greyhawk Grimoires|53}} over the ages he spent in [[undeath]] Vecna became maligned across the [[multiverse]], and was considered the scourge of all civilization.{{Cite dragon/361/The Allure of Evil|26-28}}

{{Quote|Evil is not an absence of good. [&hellip;] It is not a choice. [&hellip;] Evil is one of two forces in the cosmos, an agency locked in eternal struggle against its antithesis. [&hellip;] Only good and evil exist. And not even a hair's width of space separates them.|Vecna}}

==Description==
As a deity, Vecna appeared as a decrepit lich missing his left hand and left eye.

==Personality==
According to some, Vecna had an obsession with acquiring and maintaining secrets,{{Cite dragon/348/Vecna|19}} but was at times prone to bouts of intense rage.{{Cite dragon/402/History Check: Kas and Vecna|1-6}}

Vecna believed that every being in existence held a single secret that could be manipulated to bring about its destruction. Uncovering that secret and exploiting its truth were the key to gaining dominion over others.

==Divine Realm==
As a deity, Vecna did not claim a domain, but instead wandered the entire multiverse. He maintained the [[Citadel of Cavitius]], originally on the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Ash]] near the border to the [[Negative Energy plane]], which he had wrested away from the [[Doomguard]] long before. The Citadel was used by Vecna as his fortress, which he visited regularly, to gloat on the despair of his defeated enemies. Later, it became his prison as it was drawn into the [[Domains of Dread]] by the [[Dark Powers]].

He also kept a hidden "black tower" within the plane of [[Pandemonium]].{{Cite dragon/360/Design & Development: D&D Cosmology|68-69}}

==Powers==
Vecna possessed a number of tremendous powers, including the ability to ''[[paralyze]]'' others with his touch, inherently cast a variety of powerful spells, and alter reality at will. He was immune to disease, ''[[disintegrate|disintegration]]'', mind-controlling powers, and a variety of other debilitating effects. His sensory perception extended far beyond that of mortal beings, up to a range of {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}}, and could similarly perceive anything within the same range as any of his worshipers. He could also feel whenever someone uncovered, disclosed, or otherwise wrote down any secret that contained information that could affect the lives of five hundred people or more.

At any time Vecna could craft any variety of magic, so long as it was valued at 30,000 [[gp]] or less.

==Possessions==
[[File:Hand_and_eye_of_vecna-5e.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The ''[[Eye of Vecna|Eye]]'' and the ''[[Hand of Vecna|Hand]]'' of Vecna, his only physical remains for a time.'']]
Vecna carried with him a ''+5 [[Unholy (weapon quality)|unholy]]'' dagger named ''[[Afterthought]]'' and protected himself with ''[[bracers of armor]]'' and a powerful ''[[cloak of resistance]]''. He also carries the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' at all times. In fact he sculpted his lich form, so it fits within his rib cage.

While not among his possessions ''per se'', there existed two powerful [[artifact]]s in the [[multiverse]] that drew their power from his undead body: his ''[[Eye of Vecna|eye]]'' and his ''[[Hand of Vecna|left hand]]''. while his eye was rumored to belong to [[Emirikol]] the [[planewalker]], both of whom spent significant time on [[Avernus]].{{Cite adventurers league/Hellfire Requiem|43}}

Even items Vecna wore as a mortal, such as a set of [[Robe of Vecna|his robes]] absorbed tremendous magical power from the undead lord and bestowed a fraction of it upon future wearers.

==Relationships==
According to Vecna's own accounts, his mortal mother was a wholly evil woman who sacrificed animals and consorted with monstrous beings. It was her cruelty that helped shape the man he was in life and undeath.

Vecna had something of a working relationship with [[Asmodeus]], the powerful [[archdevil]] having offered the archlich use of his [[devil]] minions. Ironically, Asmodeus' servant [[Fierna]] stole a valuable secret from Vecna: that of how to directly travel between the [[Prime Material plane]] and the [[Nine Hells]].

He had two known [[exarch]]s: [[Falazure]] the Night Dragon, and allegedly, [[Vocar]] the Disobedient, the latter of whom was rumored to possess a powerful secret regarding Vecna himself.

===Enemies===
Vecna was obsessed with taking revenge on his [[vampire]] lieutenant [[w:c:greyhawk:Kas|Kas]] for the [[Vecna#Death and Ascension|legendary betrayal]] he committed against his master on Oerth.

The Whispered One was a sworn enemy of the [[Raven Queen]], whom he envied for her unique abilities to tap into the flow of souls and to harvest knowledge. One of his goals was to overthrow the Queen and rule the entire [[Shadowfell]] from her [[Fortress of Memories]]. His servants constantly battled with the Raven Queen's [[shadar-kai (elf)|shadar-kai]] followers.

As a demigod, Vecna sought to attain dominion over time from the god [[Pelor]], as it as a concept stood in opposition to the existence of lichdom,{{Cite dragon/430/Bazaar of the Bizarre: It's About Time|28}} and was considered an enemy of the deity [[Hlal]].

==Activities==
{{Quote|I have but one warning before I leave you to your awakening. Resist not the truths I and perhaps others record here. Open your mind and heart to the knowledge contained on these pages. Only then will you understand and receive the wisdom darkness can provide. [&hellip;] Embrace the lore and spurn the light, and you too shall ever after walk in darkness.|Vecna's introduction to the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]''}}

Vecna sought to destroy other gods in order to garner more power for himself.

Some sages also claimed that Vecna had laid out traps for wizards seeking forbidden secrets in their quest for power. Those wizards that stumbled upon those traps were transformed into [[nothic]]s. It was common to find nothics in cults to Vecna serving as guardians or jesters, as well as spies to Vecna himself, who could always see through their single eyes.

Many academics believed Vecna was the original author of the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'', which later received additions from other evil scholars. He also authored other lesser-known works such as ''[[Ordinary Necromancy]]''{{Cite dragon/82/Spells between the covers|59}} and ''[[Vecna's Ineffuble Variorum]]''. He crafted a number of spells including ''[[Vecna's conflagration]]'' and ''[[Vecna's Ultimate Abjuration]]'', the latter of which could theoretically protect liches from the powers of gods.{{Cite dragon/225/Three Greyhawk Grimoires|49-51}}

He was also believed to be the creator of the ''[[pearl of secrets]]'', a sentient ''[[pearl of power]]'' that compelled its owner to seek out ''Vecna's hand'' and ''eye''.

==Worshipers==
[[File:Vecna_symbol-3e.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''A [[holy symbol]] of Vecna.'']]
{{Quote|The cult of Vecna teaches that Vecna was cursed by gods who were jealous of his power. [&hellip;] Vecna confronted his own death and imprisoned it in a castle on the gray sands of an alien world, where it wails in eternal torment.|A member of the Zarovan tribe of [[Vistani]].}}

The [[cult of Vecna]] acted in secret for much of the Arch-Lich's existence and were emboldened upon his ascension to godhood.{{Cite dragon/348/Vecna|22}} They were a wholly [[evil]] group, and the Shadowfell— and exploit secret information to accumulate power and gain control over others. 

Vecna attracted among his worshipers a notable number of [[kenku]]s, [[half-fiend]]s, and even some [[neogi]]. Some [[evil|morally-corrupt]] [[psion|practitioners]] of [[psionics]] also offered their veneration to Vecna.{{Cite dragon/377/The Psion|6}}

Among Vecna's worshipers was a secret society referred to as the [[Halls of Secrets]]. They believed that knowledge was the most pure form of power, and only those that made the effort to fully understand the nature of that knowledge were worthy of the power that accompanied it. They maintained anonymity while parsing through all the accumulated knowledge in their possessions, in order to fully assess and judge its value. It only attracted members that were [[neutral|unconcerned with morality or ethics]].

The [[Eyes of Vecna]] was an order of Vecna's followers that strove to keep knowledge and secrets from those considered unworthy to possess them. It operated in small cells of a handful of individuals.

==Places of Worship==
Temples of Vecna were known to have been built in [[House of the Eye|Gloomwrought]] and [[Zerthadlun]].

==History==
===Mortal Life===
Vecna's early life was clouded in legend and contradiction. Most accounts stated that he was originally a [[human]] [[wizard]] from Oerth, although some reports claimed that he was a [[half-elf]]. After having become an extremely powerful wizard, Vecna began to fear for his own mortality, an obsession some say was triggered by the death of his mother.

One theory states Vecna was taught by [[Orcus]] how to achieve undeath, eventually leading to his becoming one of the most powerful liches in existence.{{Cite dragon/348/Vecna|32}} believed to have been a personification of magic itself. Regardless of how it began, Vecna's path to becoming a lich was said to be the first instance of a mortal possessing the willpower to sacrifice their own body for such a feat.{{Cite dragon/395/Channel Divinity: Vecna|22-28}}

===Rise to Power===
In one of his earliest battles, Vecna was nearly destroyed by clerics of the Oerthian god Pelor, but was spared annihilation by one of his most trusted lieutenants—and former apprentice— the half-[[demon]] called [[Acererak]]. In truth, Acererak arranged for Vecna to be ambushed in order to gain favor with his master and position himself closer to Vecna's most treasured secrets.

After Vecna became aware of Acererak's treachery, he vowed to never let his esoteric knowledge be compromised again. Vecna's zeal for secrecy and ever-growing power led to him being worshiped as something of a god, even before any form of ascension. From among his most-fervent devotees arose the heartless [[paladin]] named Kas. 

Over time Vecna conquered a vast expanse northwest of the [[w:c:greyhawk:Azure Sea|Azure Sea]] on Oerth, forming the [[Occluded Empire]].{{Cite dragon/418/Backdrop: Hochoch|28}}{{Cite dragon/348/Vecna|20}} During his reign, Vecna trusted his lieutenant Kas with most administrative tasks, using [[necromantic]] magic to grant him unnatural longevity as a vampire and forging the powerful ''[[w:c:greyhawk:Sword of Kas|Sword of Kas]]'' as an instrument of his authority.

===Death and Ascension===
However, Vecna's evil manifested in the sword and seduced Kas into usurping and killing his master. According to one storyteller, Vecna had accumulated enough collective power and magic to achieve apotheosis by means of a ritual in his [[Rotted Tower]], but Kas interrupted the ritual and attacked his master; the two engaging in a tremendous battle. In the end Vecna gained the upper hand, but just as the lich moved to slay his former servant, Kas cut off his hand and plunged his sword into Vecna's left eye. Finally, a massive explosion destroyed the tower and shook the surrounding lands. According to others, Vecna banished Kas to the realm of Cavitius, but not in time to avoid his own destruction.

Regardless of the exact specifics, the only traces left of Vecna's physical body were his left hand and eye, which still carried a fragment of the lich's will. Their latent power turned them into the artifacts known as the ''[[Hand of Vecna]]'' and the ''[[Eye of Vecna]]''.

Vecna's spirit endured, however, languishing across the planes and slowly gathering power from the surviving members of his cult;{{Cite dragon/348/Vecna|26}}

After several centuries,  Vecna amassed sufficient followers and worshipers among ambitious wizards to reach the status of [[demigod]], At this point, many, including  [[Elminster]], were aware of the threat of Vecna's ascension.{{Cite dragon/188/The Wizards Three: Sorcery from Three Worlds|27}}

After a failed attempt to ascend to full deity status, Vecna himself was banished to Cavitius, which was drawn into the Domains of Dread by the Dark Powers;

===Vecna Dies, Again===
[[File:Vecna_DVD!.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Vecna, as he appeared around the invasion of [[Sigil]].'']]
Some time later, Vecna once again attempted to ascend to the status of [[greater deity]] via organizing a centuries-long plot culminating in his absorbing the essence of the demigod [[w:c:greyhawk:Iuz|Iuz]] and also invading [[Sigil]], from where he  could exert control over the entire multiverse. 

Vecna invaded the City of Doors, becoming the only deity in existence that successfully breached Sigil's defenses, and caused a great disturbance in the multiverse but was once again thwarted by adventurers  and expelled from Sigil with assistance from the [[Lady of Pain]]. Following Vecna's defeat, the Lady of Pain strengthened Sigil's defenses and reorganized the planar structure in order to repair the damage caused and to prevent such an event from ever happening again.

===Travels Through Time===
At some point in his existence Vecna managed to steal one of the original ''[[black obelisk]]s'' created by the enigmatic group known as the [[Weavers]]. He used the powerful artifact to travel to essentially remove all trace of the Weavers from known history and stole all knowledge regarding the obelisk's creation. By some means, that information came into the hands of the [[arcanist]]s of ancient [[Netheril]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Some scholars speculated whether or not Vecna actually authored his namesake ''Variorum''. The inclusion of the spell ''[[depth perception]]'' within the [[spellbook]] led to the theory that the Vecna foresaw the loss of his eye—but not his own death—and thus created a spell to improve his hampered vision.

The origins of Vecna's ascension to divinity was considered a great secret, fitting for the god that obsessed over them. One of the most outlandish, though widely believed, theories stated that Vecna's assault on Sigil granted him the will to restructure the multiverse as he saw fit.
