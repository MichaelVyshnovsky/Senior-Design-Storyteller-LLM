Gruumsh created the orcs and guided their destiny with the aid of his divine subordinates, ruling over orcish mortals and gods alike as their unquestioned patriarch.

        "mainbody": "All sensation was erased from Gruumsh's mind in a burst of white-hot pain. Corellon simply regarded his foe, uncertain of whether or not the fight was over as Gruumsh spoke out against him. The orc threatened and swore at the Protector, whose own fortitude was beginning to falter from his various injuries, promising him eternal misery and the destruction of all he created. Unsure if Gruumsh could live up to his promise of continuing the fight, Corellon left, back towards Arvandor. Gruumsh's other injuries would heal, and quickly at that, but he would remain half-blinded for all time.\n\nSome said that Corellon made particularly sure to twist his blade so that Gruumsh's eye would never heal, and that in fact it was the cause of the meeting. In this tale, Corellon knew Gruumsh's eye gave him his prescient powers, and at great personal cost had secured knowledge on how to strip this power from him. Never, neither at the battle's start or end, did he plan on killing the orc; assuming that he could, he didn't want to (perhaps out of some sense of divine kinship, whether one believed the stories of their relatedness or not). Neither would it be honorable to slay an unarmed or wounded foe, a dishonor that Sehanine herself would be bound to report.\n\nStanding once more, Gruumsh attempted to track down Corellon, expressly planning to fight him if he still stood or slay him where he layed. Even if not for Arvandor's natural defenses, he was stopped by Lolth, caught as a fly in the Weaver's conjured web. She would attempt to gain information out of the One-Eye, but Gruumsh would have none of it, especially after his defeat and subsequent capture at her hands. Fact or fiction, their history cast aside, Gruumsh denied her, and counted her as a foe ever since.\n\nWith Corellon beyond his reach (an arguable retreat on the elven god's part), Gruumsh was left to leave Arborea on his own. The connection was but a rumor however, as was the blood's alleged link to the one-eyed [[cyclops]]es.\n\nWhether or not one believed that Gruumsh won the battle, elves and orcs thought of this (albeit incorrectly) as the genesis of the latter race. nursing his hatred for him below the earth. Just as Corellon's blood (mixed with Sehanine's tears) formed the souls of new elves, In his most painful hour, his race of special servitors that would bring destruction to Corellon's works, the vision he had foreseen, would come to pass.\n\n===Birthright===\nThe creation legends of the various demihuman (including elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings) and human peoples stressed the importance of the deal their gods had with one another about allocated living spaces in the world. The greatest gods created and/or shaped the worlds, and in them Corellon took the woodlands, Moradin the mountains, Garl the hills, and [[Yondalla]] the meadows, with the protean humans allowed to live wherever they could thrive. The gods were in agreement regarding their peoples places and it was deemed good; not so in the myths of the orcs.\n\nIn the myths of pre-history constantly retold by their shamans, the orcs held to the\n\nIt was important to note that even in some elven myths of this ancient story, where the gods agreed on dominions rather than selecting them randomly, the element of there being no good territories remaining for Gruumsh remained. In non-orc legends he was said to have emerged from the shadows of the Underdark, almost always being the one to bring strife into the world through his violence and fell creatures. Indeed, in elven myths it was the hatred he introduced through the Godswar that resulted in the gods secretly encouraging their people to spread beyond their chosen borders. In any case, Gruumsh's divine fury was said to have been respected by his fellow gods in the past, and yet in this moment he felt himself and his chosen people cast aside without respect, robbed of a place in the world.\n\n[[File:GruumshSmite.png|thumb|right|450px|Gruumsh destroying the world to make lands for his people.]]\nAt first Gruumsh was silent, but then he lifted his spear over the world and unleashed a furious bellow. So did Gruumsh pierce the mountains, lay waste to the green hills, gouge the meadows and burn the forests. He made chasms, rifts, caves, badlands, barren wastes, and blighted glades for his followers to inhabit (although in some he just takes the caves, cliffs, and dark places no one else wants and plots vengeance from there). Then did Gruumsh swear that his people would avenge themselves by taking other lands for themselves, declaring total war against the other gods (especially the Seldarine and [[Morndinsamman]], whose forests and mountains he would have chosen second and first respectively and who he felt particularly cheated by) and that a time would come when orcs ruled the world.\n\n===Acheron===\nOver the course of history, Gruumsh and his pantheon had always been without a permanent home, It is unclear if the gods mentioned in [[Dragon magazine 62]], [[Monster Mythology]], and [[Faiths and Pantheons]] are meant to be the same deities. This might have been because they conspired to depose Gruumsh (since then he ruled the others tyrannically) and were destroyed utterly, or the result of Ilneval undermining and systematically destroying them. The Crafty Warrior's scheming saw other (possibly the same or including the same) orc gods relegated to lesser status in his climb to power, and it was letting his pantheon members fight amongst themselves that saw them removed from the Hells.\n\nForced to leave their territories in the other planes of lawful evil, Neither side would move to another dull cube or share the current one, fighting for centuries to secure one dismal hill only to lose it again the next decade. So it continued until the cubes were separated, not that this ceased the feud between the rival powers.\n\n===Orcgate Wars===\nGruumsh's pantheon suffered even more casualties with the advent of the [[Orcgate Wars]]. In [[-1076 DR]], on a southern portion of the [[Plateau of Thay]], a horde of orcs was unleashed, quickly overrunning the territories of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]]. The orcs were from another world, having discovered a massive [[Gate]] opened years earlier by the rebel [[wizard]] [[Thayd]]. The god-kings of those lands mustered opposing armies and charged against them, and in response the orc shamans (using magic since lost to their descendants) summoned avatars of their own gods to counterattack.\n\nThe war would rage on for the next four years, culminating in heavy losses on the sides of both armies. Despite enemy tactics, the orcs nearly overwhelmed the hastily assembled human forces, who only survived by the grace of [[Re]], Lord of Sun and leader of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], blinding the orc army. It was then that Gruumsh and his divine allies charged forward, and at great personal cost to themselves, slew the god-king of Mulhorand, thus committing the first act of deicide in the Realms.\n\nRe's death was not in vain however, for [[Anhur]], Lord of War, had devised a brilliant trap. The elite forces of both Unther and Mulhorand had been held in reserve up until this point, and once the orcs charged had smashed into their flanks. The orc was army scattered and Gruumsh, along with the rest of his pantheon, was forced to retreat. the price of this unprovoked conflict was steep. Many gods and divine manifestations from his side had died as well, and those that hadn't were severely weakened from the fight against Re.\n\n===Recent History===\nThe problems for the orc gods did not stop in Faerun's ancient past. During the [[Time of Troubles]], the travel god [[Shaundakul]] was said to have slain at least one demipower, possibly of orcish origin, in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. His position did improve with the advent of the World Tree Cosmology however, where Nishrek was its own domain not constantly beset by goblinoid hosts, even if the wars just turned inwards.\n\n[[File:Gruumsh symbol - Mike Schely.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gruumsh's symbol during the Spellplague]]\nThe [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] and the decades preceding it saw a further flourishing of Gruumsh's influence. The orc population grew and more humanoids fell under his sway as he put his own pantheon and other minor deities of savage races under his control.\n\nUnfortunately for Gruumsh, this supremacy did not last. Over the course of the [[Second Sundering]] he lost his Talos aspect and Maglubiyet had broken free of Bane's control, their eternal war in Acheron recommencing. Furthermore, his control over his own pantheon had waned, as it was around this time when Luthic's secret romance with Grumbar was uncovered.\n\nThe [[archmage]] [[Tzunk]] went so far as to predict that the Cave Mother would outlast Gruumsh in the war against Maglubiyet, surpassing even her husband in ferocity when her children were threatened. Where Gruumsh saw the war simply as an opportunity for glorious battle, she took a longer view of the conflict, understanding its cosmic implications for the orcs. Tzunk predicted that the war would end with her the last god standing, ascending to rule her warrior children.\n\n[[File:CvsGAgain.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Gruumsh and Corellon clash yet again.]]\nRegardless of his future, Gruumsh was still a powerful, destructive force in the multiverse. He swore revenge against all other gods for their alleged crimes against him, and Corellon above all others for maiming and robbing him of his own powers of premonition. Thus would the One-Eyed God continue his eternal war of vengeance against his peers; he remained a threat into the modern era, too treacherous to be dealt with and far too angry to be ignored.",

        },
        "Personality": "Violent and bloodthirsty, Gruumsh was a god that exulted in battle and reveled in warfare. whose desire to wreak havoc could only be satisfied through destruction and carnage. and he needed no greater reason to create gore than to hear the pleasing sound of viscera flopping wetly to the ground. Gruumsh was also driven and aggressive,\n\nAppropriately for a god with only one eye, Gruumsh had two crippling weaknesses that often undermined him: his narrow perspective and shortsighted outlook. Gruumsh had only one view of the world—his own—and could prove incapable of looking at a situation from other angles or seeing things from someone else's position. When not given what he believed to be due respect or proper notice, he immediately attacked the other party rather than asking why, and it was this \"act first, think later\" attitude which had negatively impacted Gruumsh's effectiveness in many tales.\n\nFor example, if [[Bahgtru]] (his son) were to stub his toe on a large rock, Gruumsh's response would likely be to curse the stone and destroy it with his son's help before declaring a victory against the forces of nature. The injuries either of them may have sustained or opponents they were planning on fighting later on were irrelevant, as the point had to be made then and there. None of this was to say Gruumsh was stupid, as he normally had the capacity to plan and act for the future, but it was easy to spark his wrath, and once inflamed, his judgement and foresight was inevitably clouded.\n\nGruumsh was an unreliable deity, ultimately more concerned with victory than any kind of honor{{Cite dragon/378/Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms|34,36-37}} and more interested in causing devastation than making long-term plots or complex maneuvers.{{Cite dragon/408/History Check: Corellon and Gruumsh|5-11}}\n\nDespite his severe standards and despotic reign, Gruumsh, in his own way, did care about the orcs. Part of why he waged war was for the glory for his people, and he always sought ever more territory for them to occupy. In the opinion of the One-Eyed God, nearly all territory rightfully belong to the orcs and he encouraged them to take their birthright by driving other races from their lands. It was this drive to acquire territory and living space that was Gruumsh's greatest motivation, and even with his bloodlust and creed of unending war, he would not object to simple colonization provided it could be arranged.",
        "Powers": "Incredibly powerful even by divine standards, Gruumsh was a god of immense physical strength and impossible vitality, even before he entered a barbaric rage. A wide variety of spell-like abilities and clerical magic powers were at his disposal.\n\nGruumsh had several unique powers as the primary god of the orcs. He could sense anything that would affect orc welfare around four months before it happened, would retain that feeling for about four more months after the event, and had a similar awareness of whenever orcs fought, warred, or had a change in territory. He could also generate a cloud of acrid, black smoke from around his body, a billowing haze similar to a ''[[cloudkill]]'' spell around {{SI|30|ft}} diameter and {{SI|10|ft}} high. It was believed that at one point he had minor powers of prescience, allowing him to receive visions of the future.",
        "Possessions": "Among Gruumsh's most iconic possessions was his [[Bloodspear (spear)|Bloodspear]], an iron weapon covered in the blood of elves. The enchanted spear could increase in length, changing from a [[halfspear]] to a [[longspear]] to strike foes that would be out of reach or too close, and those pierced by it could find themselves paralyzed.\n\nGruumsh also had other spears he could use in combat, and on occasion he was known to fling one at a cleric of his he was annoyed with. Clerics that atoned for their transgressions and that kept the spears would find it had become a ''[[spear of retribution]]'', able to return to its wielder when thrown and particularly dangerous against those that had recently harmed the user.\n\nConversely, shamans could so impress Gruumsh with their outstanding destructive tendencies that he rewarded them with a magical iron spear, a weapon granted to only a twentieth of the most powerful among them. They functioned as ''+4'' weapons when held (not thrown) by an orc shaman, were non-magical for all others, and burned elves that touched them, forcing them to be dropped.{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|30}} \n\nHis spears aside, another of Gruumsh's infamous tools was his eternal torch, that burned with a fire that could never be dimmed or quenched which was reflected in his one remaining eye. From the torch could come corrosive black clouds, and using it Gruumsh could cast both ''cloudkill'' and ''[[death fog]]'' three times per day.\n\nAlong with these Gruumsh always carried either a ''[[horn of blasting]]'' or a glass vessel with around 2-8 doses of ''[[dust of sneezing and coughing]]'', which he could light with the torch (while remaining immune to the effects) to create a {{SI|20|ft}} radius of the foul substance.\n\nGruumsh was fully capable of working metal and stone to craft weapons and armor, magical or otherwise. His suit of armor was supposedly fashioned from the hides of forty slain [[dragon]]s.",

            "Tree": "[[File:Cosmology.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Nishrek in a chart of the [[World Tree cosmology]].]]\n\nIn the [[World Tree Cosmology]], Nishrek was different from its incarnation in Acheron in that the endless battle was not against the goblinoid hordes of Maglubiyet. Every night, orc warriors clashed in devastating battles, waging war in favor of peace and foregoing diplomacy to instead brutalize each other internally. The reason for this conflict was that each tribe of orc petitioner sought to prove themselves to Gruumsh, believing that one day he would declare a single tribe his true children, and the orcs within it to be the superior to all others. [[Hellwasp]]s were also said to be native there, their swarms being one of the few events able to provoke the attention of orc armies. The [[Blood War]] between [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s often spilled into the plane, a frequent connection to the [[Blood Rift]] mixing the two eternal conflicts.\n\nThough not many creatures could survive in Nishrek, those that fought on its battlefields would be suffused with [[positive energy]], orc or otherwise. Almost every creature in Nishrek recovered from injury at an enhanced rate, could regrow lost limbs given the time, and even if slain in battle, would rise again each sunset with renewed vigor, as if they had received a ''[[true resurrection]]'' spell. Nishrek's petitioners were mostly orcs and half-orcs, which looked the same as they did as mortals, although they had the benefit of being unfazed by electricity or the cold and resistant to acid and flames. Followers of elven and dwarven gods were weakened on Nishrek.\n\nNishrek appeared as an endless plain, with the [[River Styx]] flowing through it and linking it to other [[fiendish planes]]. Its surface was scarred with crisscrossing trenches and riddled with fortresses, in both of which lived whole orc petitioner communities. Both types were wretched, and the orcs within spent their days waiting for the next attack. Gruumsh watched the carnage from his [[Iron Fortress]], and within its walls all orc and orc petitioners were extremely resistant to magical powers and injury in general.",
            "Axis": "In the [[World Axis Cosmology]], Nishrek was a dark reflection of [[Warrior's Rest]]. It was a setting ravaged by conflict and carnage, a realm of self-destructive savagery where the favored of Gruumsh slaughtered each other for destruction's own sake. The natural setting had been warped by the endless warfare, with jagged badlands, scorching deserts, devastating volcanoes, twisted forests, dark rivers, and black seas. The realm was connected to the Abyss in the [[Elemental Chaos]], and Gruumsh watched this land from his Iron Fortress."

Much of his attention was taken up by the war between goblinoids and orcs in their afterlife, Normally he only dispatched an [[avatar]] to oversee an important battle that the other orcish gods of war ([[Bahgtru]] and [[Ilneval]]) couldn't be entrusted with. He also sent one on rare occasion to interfere with the appearance of an elven avatar, or if he suspected Corellon or some other meddling power was plotting against the orcs.\n\nGruumsh was always watching over the orcs and especially wary of transgressions, but this could be as much a curse as a boon. Orcs that couldn't meet his high expectations were destroyed by Gruumsh either through fire or through the aggression of rival orc clans. He often wandered Nishrek, the orcish afterlife, as the orcs warred amongst themselves, choosing to aid either side (as far as anyone could tell) on his whims. Sometimes he would allow an orc army to take shelter from within the Iron Fortress from which he watched the fighting, and at other times he refused.",

Luthic's at birth, Luthic's at death, and striving to prove themselves to Gruumsh in between.}}\n\nThough Gruumsh's servant, Luthic proved more dangerous than her subservient position would first make her appear. She was among the few beings able to bend Gruumsh's ear, often able to manipulate him to get what she wanted (even if he didn't truly heed her words), and she wasn't shy about using her influence. Even so, Luthic was not truly faithful to her demeaning husband, and was actually involved in a secret romance with the god of elemental earth [[Grumbar]]. When Luthic managed to secure the Eye of Gruumsh, she did not give it to her husband but rather to Grumbar in order to prevent him from leaving in an attempt to protect her from Gruumsh's wrath. Though Gruumsh discovered the tryst, the consequences were unknown.\n\nThe son of Gruumsh and Luthic was Bahgtru, the orc god of might and loyalty. It was through the Fist of Gruumsh's tests of strength that his brash followers would prove who among them would one day be worthy of standing under the One-Eyed God's gaze. Bahgtru (who curiously had two eyes) was as phenomenally powerful as he was unbelievably stupid, trusting both his parents completely and requiring guidance in things other gods would do without need for instruction. The one exception to the rule of complete obedience to his father came when his commmands were countermanded by his mother. He gave heed to her orders where Gruumsh did not, and when forced to choose between them would unfailingly pick Luthic, a minor betrayal Gruumsh tolerated only grudgingly.\n\nGruumsh's lieutenant and right hand was Ilneval, orc god of war and strategy, although Gruumsh did not trust him. The Crafty Warrior secretly desired Gruumsh's position, which the One-Eyed God was fully aware of, and had been waiting for ages to take his place. However, Gruumsh chose not to take action so long as Bahgtru, who Ilneval was terrified of, was on his side. Ilneval was also believed to lust after Luthic, but feared the consequences of acting on this desire.\n\n[[Shargaas]] the Night Lord, orc god of darkness and stealth, hated all living things, which extended to divine life and included his master. and only worked with his pantheon out of pragmatic self-preservation. Shargaas sought to ignore the war between goblins and orcs, but had little choice but to assist Gruumsh when asked. Gruumsh did not always appreciate subtle subterfuge, as the orcs were supposed to obtain what they desired with direct force, but he occasionally needed the Night Lord's agents to assassinate a goblinoid general, after which Shargaas would retreat so deep into his realm that not even Gruumsh could contact him for over a year.\n\n[[Yurtrus]] the Rotting Lord, orc god of death and disease, had a silent alliance with Shargaas to counterbalance the warmongering influence of Gruumsh, as well as Bahgtru and Ilneval. but he was nonetheless a punisher, serving Gruumsh by spreading disease. Those orc tribes that did not follow the decrees of Gruumsh—bringing ruin to the land, raiding neighbors, and killing elves and dwarves—risked a plague by Yurtrus's white hands. Though Gruumsh could likely kill Yurtrus if he got close enough, it was rumored that even he was too frightened by the disgusting abomination that was the Lord of Maggots to do so.",
                "Agents": "Gruumsh would often send incredibly powerful, [[fiendish creature|fiendish]] orc barbarians to act as his heralds on the Material Plane. His embrace of chaos saw him lose some of his ability to command [[Angel (astral)|astral angels]], though he still occasionally made use of them. \n\nThe best known proxy of Gruumsh was [[Makrete Ironskull]] of the Three Fang tribe, an [[ogrillon]] petitioner that commanded thousands of soldiers in the field from the army's rear. His epithet was taken from the metal plate covering a head wound that never properly healed, oozing blood and pus when he fought hand to hand and occasionally causing him to enter maddened rages. Still, he was affable when not in pain, and hadn't lost his tactical brilliance which allowed him to best every one of Rostorhan the Foul's (an exiled [[cornugon]] under Maglubiyet obsessed with defeating him) maneuvers on the battlefield.\n\nThe greatest of Gruumsh's proxy chieftains was [[Arderott]], who was in command of the town of Rotting Eye. It was rumored that he named almost everything the \"rotting\" something in an attempt at clever wit. He ruled the Rotting Eye from the Rotting Throne, a gross mass of dead captives, stolen loot, and battle standards.",
                "Others": "Gruumsh disliked everything that wasn't an orc or made by orcs, [[Asmodeus]] and his vassals had long had pacts with various evil gods, Gruumsh included, meaning that devils could commonly be found serving the One-Eyed God. Flamebrother [[salamander]]s were also among his allies.\n\nThe [[kobold]] god [[Kurtulmak]] had also worked with Gruumsh in the past and was reluctant to oppose him and gods like him, although he considered Gruumsh and the orc pantheon specifically to be stupid oafs. Gruumsh struck a deal with Kurtulmak once, who revealed how he could get his revenge. Using potent magic that involved the sacrifice of thousands of orcs, kobolds, and captive elves they hid away the [[Misty Isle]], a place sacred to the Corellite faith. Neither god nor mortal could find it, knowing only that elves still lived there and couldn't leave, and the ordeal led to the creation of the [[Seekers of the Misty Isle]], an order dedicated to scouring the cosmos for it. The two patron gods could have hidden the portal to the Isle anywhere, from a city sewer or lonely mountain, to the depths of the Abyss.{{Cite dragon/394/Channel Divinity: Corellon's Devoted|39}}"

            "Enemies": {
                "Elves": "[[File:CorellonvsGruumsh.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Corellon taking out Gruumsh's eye.]]\nOf all the various races and their patron deities, Gruumsh had a particular hatred of the elven gods.\n\nOf all the elven gods however, at the very least before his legendary fight with Corellon, it was [[Sehanine Moonbow]] that Gruumsh reserved a special hatred for. Corellon was bad enough from Gruumsh's perspective, but when confronting him he could at least expect straightforward battle and invigorating bloodshed, something he could not only understand, but also respect. Sehanine on the other hand was subtle, her behavior unpredictable and her ways unfathomable to the mind of an orcish warrior. She was not only pale and wispy, but also feminine, all traits that would indicate weakness, and yet she was a still a dangerous foe. The fey, magical Sehanine offended Gruumsh's sensibilities regarding size, strength, and gender roles, and for that she earned a unique enmity from He-Who-Watches.\n\nOne might think that [[Lolth]] and Gruumsh would make natural allies, as both were comparable entities of divine chaos with a strong hatred of Corellon. Though the two were believed to have had dalliances in the past, they were, in truth, fundamentally different. The Spider Queen was whimsically wicked, but her complicated acts of malice were deliberate and well-woven. Gruumsh, meanwhile, was steady in his rage, but this focused fury was as mindless as a tempest. Gruumsh had never been a cooperative deity, and once the deceptive demoness betrayed him, he refused to work with her again. As far as he was concerned, she was an elf, making her his enemy, and he hated her as much as he ever hated Corellon. Lolth had little issue with this, and was happy to be rid of the odorous orc deity, knowing there were other gods she could manipulate.",
                "Dwarves": "Gruumsh's hatred for the dwarven gods, especially [[Moradin]], was roughly equivalent to his loathing of the elven ones. but every orc tribe dreamed of taking a dwarven stronghold, as well as the loot within.\n\nAlthough the orcs lost their war for the mountains,",
                "Gnomes": "Of the [[gnome]] gods, [[Garl Glittergold]] and [[Baervan Wildwanderer]] could become annoyances. Garl was a prankster that valued light-heartedness over grim determination, and when mischief was on his mind Gruumsh's axe could sprout donkey heads at the worst possible time just as Moradin's beard could end up tied with giggling flowers. Baervan's constant companion [[Chiktikka Fastpaw]], a trouble-making, giant [[raccoon]], was known to perform acts as outrageous as stealing Gruumsh's breakfast, and Baervan was often held responsible when she did.",
                "Goblinoids": "The goblinoid god Malgubiyet was, in many ways, similar to Gruumsh. Both were iron-fisted tyrants that reveled in warfare, seeking conflict for the acclaim of their peoples and always urging them on to find more. However, the exact motivations of the two varied slightly.\n\nGruumsh saw his war in Acheron as a chance to pit his race against an eager enemy, allowing them to prove their worth to their gods, and he both relished every victory and cursed every setback (short-term or otherwise). Meanwhile, Maglubiyet marshaled his Host of Immortals against Gruumsh's slavering hordes in attempt to bring him and the rest of his pantheon to heel. Maglubiyet could also be said to be even more motivated by bloodshed than Gruumsh, for while the One-Eyed God also sought to have his people destroy the surface races, this was driven by his desire for territory, and he urged the orcs to inhabit any environment they could find. Goblinoids meanwhile had a stronger affinity with underground terrain, and Maglubiyet sought the destruction of surface races for the conquering and killing rather than the land.\n\nHowever, Maglubiyet suffered from the fact that his own pantheon (disregarding the [[bugbear pantheon]]) was both more divided and less populated than that of Gruumsh. Unlike Gruumsh, Maglubiyet had no trusted and capable right hand to command the troops without his supervision, being too paranoid to allow his servitors great power, and he felt this vulnerability keenly. On the other hand, he also had a mediator deity in [[Bargrivyek]], who kept [[Khurgorbaeyag]]'s [[goblin]]s and [[Nomog-Geaya]]'s [[hobgoblin]]s cohesive. The orcs had no such thing, and Gruumsh's willingness to let the members of his pantheon squabble was possibly one of his major weaknesses.\n\nGruumsh was known to harbor ill-will towards the goblinoid god [[Grankhul]], [[bugbear]] deity of stealth and hunting, for his symbol was an always open eye surrounded by darkness. The strange, dark, elemental entity known as [[the Stalker]] could also be counted among Gruumsh's enemies. Legend said that when a race of entities (the exact type depending upon the storyteller) entered its dark cave complex, the demigod was driven out and had sought vengeance ever since. It was fueled by a hateful hunger for souls, but was not strong enough to oppose gods as powerful as Gruumsh, instead focusing its anger on creatures like bugbears, kobolds, and [[gnoll]]s.",
                "Other Enemies": "While gods such as Lolth and [[Tharizdun]] had demonstrated a potential willingness to side with primordial forces if the ancient war between [[Dawn War|Law and Chaos]] was to begin anew, Gruumsh, although chaotic in several ways and not to be depended on, would likely side with beings of order.\n\nThe iron-fisted patriarch of the orcs looked down on the tanar'ri as rabble, seeing the chaos of the undisciplined fiends as weakness. In the mind of the One-Eyed God, weakness had to be burnt away. The thought of the tanar'ri running rampant throughout reality was enough to anger Gruumsh, In any case, when he had soldiers to spare, Gruumsh sent his fiercest orc warriors to crush the mewling mobs of demonkind. Given his war with Maglubiyet however, where both sides would attack whenever the other lulled in ferocity, orcs sent to fight the Blood War had to be ready to return home at a moment's notice."
            },
            "Others": "Gruumsh had searched the cosmos for his eye, and sought to rip apart whatever being had kept it for him. Unbeknownst to him, it was the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian]] goddess of magic, [[Hecate]], that had the eye, and who had left a trail of clues for him to follow. It would have been possible for him to get it back if he could ever decipher the hints, but eventually Luthic, who had persistently been trying to obtain Hecate's assistance, managed to obtain it.\n\nGruumsh, along with Corellon, had accidentally created the [[elder evil]] known as the [[Elf Eater]]. Spawned by the combination of both their blood, the abominable Ityak-Ortheel fled into the Abyss soon after its creation, and had plagued the elves since that time."
        },
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Orc society was based on the ideals of strength, survival, fear, and war, principles founded in the veneration of Gruumsh and taught to young orcs through cruel experience. Gruumsh, as it was said, made his children strong so that they could take what they needed from others, and such orcs saw the world as theirs for the taking.\n\nGruumsh drove the orcs to follow his example by conquering their opposition. They were to crush their foes by any means necessary (despite Gruumsh's preference for straightforward brutality) and kill or enslave those that stood in their way. They were to seek never-ending war against their enemies, a dictate ensured by Gruumsh's own deep, spiteful hate for other gods and his desire to lay waste to civilization and revel in its despair. As such, devotees of Gruumsh felt it was their duty to direct the natural orcish proclivity for war. They would encourage it, becoming war-leaders (or key advisors to same), and acted as emissaries to the goblinoids that often joined their hordes.\n\nOn a personal level, Gruumsh demanded his followers to be strong and prepared to showcase their strength at any moment, hence why his disciples were sure to maintain their physical fitness. As was the way in Nishrek, what didn't kill them would make them stronger, and Gruumsh supported the strong. Conversely, Gruumsh encouraged his followers to slaughter the weak to earn his favor, for runts and cripples were not just burdens, but signs of his disfavor. Showing weakness would lead to death quickly and there was no place for cowardice when the orcs had yet to claim what belonged to them.",
            "Rituals": "[[File:EyeofGruumsh.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An Eye of Gruumsh.]]\nClerics and [[adept]]s of Gruumsh prayed for their spells in the dark of night and their holy days took place during the new moon. Anniversaries of great battles against dwarves, elves, or other orc tribes were also considered holy days. The last day of [[Marpenoth]], called Gharfek’taaz (meaning the Feast of the Bloodied Stones) by Gruumans, commemorated Gruumsh’s ascendancy as the master of Nishrek and it was on this day that new shamans were ordained in bloody orgies of sacrifices and tortures.\n\nGruuman orcs had a variety of conflicting messages about how Gruumsh was to be worshiped, and different tribes had their own superstitions about how to garner his favor or ward off his ire. A clear example of the divide in religious practices regarded the matter of ritual eye removal. Orcs often attempted to prove their faith to Gruumsh by gouging out and sacrificing to him one of their eyes, If an orc slayed an elf in his name and offered the corpse as a sacrifice, he might personally appear as an aspect and demand either of the supplicant's eyes, the reward for which was the ultimate honor of carrying a small part of Gruumsh's unyielding rage into battle in the form of divine magic.\n{{Fq\n| width  = 275px\n| source = A [[vistani]].\n| text   = Regardless of the original number of eyes their god possessed, orc shamans are required to remove one of their own — usually the left eye. Why? This is an act of devotion and pain made to honor He Who Watches.\n}}\nDespite how different they could be, religious practices regarding Gruumsh did have common features. All prayers to Gruumsh began with the word \"kharg-hark\", meaning \"revenge\" in [[Orcish]], regardless of the prayer's context. Following the One-Eye's shortsighted example, religious ceremonies made no mention of the future outside of the oft-repeated declaration that they intended to take over the world. The most famous rite however was the \"Ritual of the Poles\", whereby orcs would mark newly conquered territory. After the battle's conclusion, the Gruumans would pound longspears point up into the ground at the boundaries of their domain, placing the head of a fallen foe on each spear-point."

        "History": {
            "In the Beginning": "{{Fq\n| width  = 375px\n| source = The introduction to [[One-Eye]], a book by [[Palmer Junisugga]].\n| text   = As Corellon Larethian's diametric opposite, Gruumsh presents a cyclopic portrait of destruction, loathing, and cruelty. Contentious orcish mythologians have dared (to their credit) to cast Gruumsh in the position of spurned son, prideful and powerful despite foul circumstances, and therefore worthy of absolution, admiration, even faith. Unconvincing, as arguments go, when weighed against the dearth of his kindnesses and mercies.\n}}\n\nGruumsh's origins were shrouded in the myths and legends of pre-history, though one tale bandied about by particularly dauntless theologians claimed a link to his archenemy Corellon. According to the legend, Corellon and Gruumsh were twin brothers (though Corellon slightly older) created by a primogenitor deity since lost to history. Some degree of clairvoyance was within this being's purview, and it foresaw a war that would engulf the gods. This forgotten deity believed its sons would be able to turn the tides in their favor, and sacrificed itself so that its children could live.{{Cite dragon/394/Channel Divinity: Corellon's Devoted|33-36}}\n\nWhether or not this tale was true, part of the reason Gruumsh and Corellon hated each other was that they diametric opposites. Where Corellon had allegedly been imbued with intelligence and light, Gruumsh was given savagery and darkness. Corellon was graceful where Gruumsh was brutal and fair where he was wanton, peerlessly agile where he was tirelessly mighty and vital, one brother reason and beauty and the other rage and ugliness. Corellon was blessed with the power to create, while Gruumsh could only destroy. Furthermore, the deity granted arcane magic to Corellon, knowing he would have the wisdom and care to deliver it to mortals, while seeding in Gruumsh a spark of divine prescience out of great compassion for its less intelligent and attractive son.\n\nDespite being cast as mirror images of each other or divine echoes of the same being, direct parallels between the two did not always line up properly or could be confusing. Some claimed Corellon possessed \"excellence\", or that one of Gruumsh's contrasting traits was \"chaos\". There was no knowing the truth of this origin myth and asking either elves or orcs would be unwise as both considered this legend to be heresy. No matter their origins, however, none would deny that a vicious rivalry had always existed between the two.\n\nThough Gruumsh and Corellon remained leery of each other, sparring and coming to blows time and again, the eternal hatred between the two had not yet been realized. At one point, Gruumsh tried to destroy [[Arvandor]] (possibly located in the [[Feywild]] at this point) before the realm could be built, and so Corellon met him in battle atop a mountain. Though some members of the [[Seldarine]] existed by this point, Corellon wished to face Gruumsh in a one-on-one duel, and managed to come out the victor, Gruumsh's blood scalding the land for miles around and turning it into a sizzling stretch of blackened badlands. Yet even this was not what truly sparked the unceasing enmity between them.",
            "Timeline": "The exact series of events that would precede the legendary clash between Corellon and Gruumsh were clouded in legend and confusion. Among them included the fall of Lolth, the ancient war between the forces of law and chaos, and the creation of the elves and orcs, each of which was riddled with interpretations and retellings. Many could potentially be true at once, and since time was experienced differently in the Feywild (when chaos invaded, they only heard rumors of violence) few could say if even the Seldarine interpretation (assuming they would give one) was correct.\n\nLolth's role in the build-up was incredibly varied. Some divinations placed her involvement with him ages before the ancient Dawn War, and that her betrayal was of Corellon due in part to having dallied with him back then. During Gruumsh's initial attack on the unfinished Arvandor, she was said to have watched in secret, admiring his fury, although any bond that may have existed between them had long since gone out. In any case, it was undisputed that she secretly acted in the One-Eye's favor at one point. Not even Corellon or Sehanine could tell whether she had turned evil or had always been different, though some claimed that the fall of the Weaver was Gruumsh's own permanent wound on Corellon.\n\nThe role of the Dawn War in events was also a matter of confusion. In some tales Lolth's betrayal and the subsequent ruin brought to Arvandor opened the eyes of the Seldarine to the larger issues of the multiverse, leading them to get involved with the conflict which Gruumsh was already fighting. Since the shedding of Corellon's blood was instrumental in the elven origin story however, elven scholars were conflicted on whether the two had their ultimate clash before that conflict. In truth, the two had fought many times before, and from various divine ichors, elves and orcs had come into being before.",
            "Dawn War": "As the story was told in every orc tribe, Gruumsh never stopped fighting during the Dawn War, never needing to rest or break off to replenish his apparently limitless strength. Corellon and his host joined the fight later, yet the elven god's devotion to the war was second to none, his fervor like that of a general. Gruumsh and Corellon fought besides one another at this time, cooperating if only grudgingly,  and indeed their combined prowess turned out to be necessary to thwart the hordes of malevolent chaos.\n\nEven as Corellon fought with the camaraderie of a sibling, however, Gruumsh harbored murderous thoughts towards Arvandor's Coronal, growing more bitter and jealous with each passing battle. Corellon had been joined the war late and yet was beloved by many, praised as a champion of war and magic. Furthermore, in his eyes at least, Corellon's host of beauteous mortals and fey servitors failed to show him proper deference. Some elven scholars claimed that it was this moment that marked the inevitable clash, going so far as to purport that it was the first time he thirsted for blood.\n\nOthers, however, purported that there was one other straw that would see the epic struggle between the rival gods explode. When the Dawn War ended, it gave the various deities time to deal with other matters, including mortals. Corellon had long regarded mortals besides elves as unrefined, yet through Sehanine realized his error, coming to embrace devotees from other peoples to bestow his gifts and wisdom upon them. And it was this act, it was said, Corellon's desire for influence in the mortal world, that was too much for Gruumsh to allow. Many times had they come to blows in the past, but it was their attempts to stake their claims on creation and gain a following among the mortal races that would be the true conception for a fight that would shape fate.",
            "The Battle's Start": "Gruumsh had seen visions of his desired battle against Corellon, as well as its gristly conclusion, as a result of his divine prescience. He dreamt of Corellon's death, his sundered body paraded through the [[Astral Plane]] as he assumed the elf's providence over magic, and of the mortal world made into a battlefield, the elven races torn down while they were still young and replaced with a people created in his own image. All he had to do, as he saw it, was make the first move.\n\nIt was Gruumsh's intent to ambush the elven god and paralyze him with his spear, hoping to kill Corellon and drink his blood to obtain his powers. Gruuman shamans would freely admit this aggressor status, claiming Corellon deserved it due to his failure to show proper deference. Gruumsh, of course, would fail due to his own shortsightedness, though it was possibly Corellon's own hauteur that allowed Gruumsh to get close enough to wound him.\n\nWhile accounts of the battle disagreed on who technically started the battle, in reality, both knew it was coming. Indeed it was Corellon who invited Gruumsh into his domain in the hopes of discussing an end to the destructive war between their peoples, and though he would have liked to claim that he had expected good faith in return, he was unsurprised when the truce was broken. Corellon had granted the orc god advantage upon advantage, foreswearing the use of elven magic, meeting him in a hilly rather than forested region as a courtesy, and surrendering his right to banish him until he chose to leave, all because it never occurred to him that he might lose.\n\nCompiled legends regarding the legendary battle purported that Gruumsh had no intention to parley with Corellon, and was loudly intent on seeing through his vision. In yet another act of treachery Gruumsh had, ironically, levied elven magic against the Coronal, colluding with Lolth to do so. One of these boons, so it was said, was a terrible spell woven into Gruumsh's weapon, rendering it invisible and poisoning its tip with paralytic venom. From that same compilation it was said that neither god was truly playing fair, and that Gruumsh's attempt to lay low his enemy failed because Corellon's apparent form was in reality one of Sehanine's most potent illusions (arguably not \"using magic against him\" as the oath went).",
            "Godswar": "The tale of Gruumsh and Corellon's battle was deeply intertwined with the event known as the Godswar, a battle primarily between the Seldarine and their allies against a varied host of wicked divinities. While it was Lolth that truly masterminded the conflict, Gruumsh, in elven legend, was said to have gotten other gods to flock to his standard when he was preparing to crush the Seldarine, and one could argue that he was the catalyst for the war.\n\nExactly who participated in the Godswar was not known, although at least a hundred divinities were reported to have joined the Anti-Seldarine coalition. Among them included evil Realmsian powers such as [[Malar]] and [[Auril]], gods such as Kurtulmak, Maglubiyet, [[Hruggek]], and [[Ghaunadaur]], and unnamed deities of the goblinoid, orc, and ogre races. On the Seldarine's side were gods from a hundred worlds, those of the woodland, the faerie folk, and even the ancient Fairy Court, including deities of the [[pixie]]s, [[sprite]]s, [[centaur]]s, [[faun]]s, and [[unicorn]]s. [[Garl Glittergold]] also aligned with the Seldarine, though various other gods, especially gods of law such as [[Bahamut]] and possibly [[Moradin]], lamented this impetuous chaos so soon after the Dawn War.\n\nThe war would go on for days, at least by the measure of immortals. Each combatant in this war suffered great injury both in body and spirit, some falling from the wayside after being badly hurt and some possibly dying. Some legitimately cared about the conflict, others had scores to settle, and others still were simply using the conflict between gods as an excuse for battle. Nonetheless, Gruumsh and Corellon's battle was a different event from the Godswar, albeit closely related, and ended before the Godswar began.",
            "The Battle": "[[File:CorellonGruumshDuel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gruumsh and Corellon locked in battle.]]\nDepending on who told the story, the battle between Gruumsh and Corellon was a mere trifle for the elf god, a combat that raged from dawn to dusk, a week long battle, or a clash of titans that spanned many planes and touched several worlds, shaking the earth and causing storms in the skies. None could say how long it lasted or to where it was confined. In Arborea, where the fight took place, a single day could last longer than a year on certain worlds, and if the fight was taken near the Feywild, as some tales purported, time would be even less reliable.\n\nIn terms of where the battle happened, certain legends claiming the Feywild as a location for the fight stated that it was where the borders of the mortal and Faerie realms were particularly thin, allowing effects to seep through to other realities. Furthermore, Corellon was said in myth to have led Gruumsh on a chase through the wilder places of the mortal world, avoiding civilizations and turning back to face him when his divine wrath would have smote wilderness too fragile to endure him. Cracks would course across the hills and yawning chasms would open;\n\nThe start of the duel saw no telling blows delivered between the rival gods; in combat, they were perfect counterparts. Gruumsh's unending strength was a match for Corellon's unrivaled agility, and his alleged foresight allowed him to anticipate the swifter swings of the elf's blade. The corrosive clouds of Gruumsh's torch and the swift thrusts of his spear were countered by the sweeps of Corellon's glittering sword. Their weapons would clash again and again but each strike was parried, and every killing strike foiled.\n\nEven so, Gruumsh, from his first strike, had seemed more confident and grimly determined than ever before, doggedly pursuing the elven deity when he inevitably began to tire. Eventually both would be bleeding equally as hard and suffering from true wounds, Gruumsh having slashed Corellon with his spear just as Corellon had pierced Gruumsh's flesh with his sword. Corellon had known well the cunning and battle fury of his opponent but had counted on two things to assure his victory despite his yielded advantages: his superior agility and [[Sahandrian]], his incredibly powerful blade. Much was his surprise when it seemed that, with naught but a rusted axe, Gruumsh shattered his sword. This, however, was yet another deception woven by Lolth, who Gruumsh had been working with; she had hexed Sahandrian's sheath, but the blade was still in shards all the same.",
            "One-Eye": "As the day waned and night waxed, Gruumsh was empowered by the growing darkness while Corellon was weakened. not just for his own sake but to protect the essence of the elven people, much as he would have liked to continue fighting. Even as he sat down to rest under the shade of a gnarled tree Gruumsh was pursuing him, the open terrain and bright moonlight making the elf all the easier to track.\n\nAnd it was at this point, the conclusion of the mythic battle, where the most contention arose and long debates were focused, primarily around a single question; what cost Gruumsh his victory, and subsequently, his eye? denied that he lost an eye to Corellon, and suggesting otherwise was blasphemy. He had either always had one eye or had gouged it out at birth, either to enhance his senses or as a sign of fealty to chaos. At best, they claimed Corellon stole the eye because he couldn't win fairly.\n\n[[File:GruumshArrows.jpg|thumb|right|800px|Gruumsh fleeing a hail of arrows from Corellon.]]\nIn contrast, elven versions of the story could skew the situation nearly as heavily in the opposite direction. Not all elves acknowledged the battle went on all that long, and in some stories, it simply annoyed the Father of Elvenkind. These elven myths stated that the battle was over before it even began, for Corellon defeated Gruumsh with a single, well-placed arrow. The illusion provided by Sehanine hid the fact that he was standing high on the other side of the valley before letting loose a divine shot, which according to some elven loremasters, blinded Gruumsh then and there. Such sages underestimated Gruumsh, for his premonitory sight and keen eyes alerted him just in time to dodge.\n\nIn this area, orc shamans spoke the truth regarding Corellon's miss (the shot just grazed Gruumsh and invigorated him with the pain). Elven stories that granted this, however, purported that this was not his intent. The arrow was meant as a warning shot rather than an actual attack, meant to point out his vulnerability since losing his eye would spell the end of much of his divine power. Given how Gruumsh would never again directly assault the Seldarine (though none could say if he might try again in the future), instead focusing his wrath on mortal elves, the threat seemed to have affected him. At that time though, Gruumsh simply bellowed and laughed; Corellon knew he would not have time to fire again, and so the fight proper began.\n\nElves that recognized the fight between Gruumsh and Corellon as a long battle normally chose to believe that Corellon won solely of his own merits. Gruumsh simply let down his guard, Corellon managing to wear down even the tireless orc god and strike him down when his strength failed.\n[[File:Corellon vs Gruumsh.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Corellon Larethian cutting out the eye of Gruumsh.'']]\nSome among orcs and elves claimed that it was Sehanine's doing that Gruumsh was defeated. She gave Corellon strength in his darkest hour, her tears mingling with his blood to give him the push he needed (similar tales had him draw strength from the spirit and song of the Feywild or find his fortitude at the sight of his friends). Both races had versions where she directly intervened, distracting Gruumsh with illusions or blinding him with light. Other orcs claimed it was Lolth who interfered, again using some dark glamour to draw Gruumsh's attention. The [[drow]] had similar teachings, claiming that the enchantments Lolth wove into Gruumsh's spear turned against him and paralyzed him at a crucial moment, only to be rewarded with exile and pain.\n\nThe truth behind these myths laid somewhere in the middle. Sehanine did appear and get involved near the battle's end, using her magic to blind Gruumsh when he attempted to attack her, and mixed her tears with Corellon's blood to create elven souls. Most importantly however, she returned Corellon's ability to fight back by restoring the destroyed Sahandrian and giving it to Corellon before clouds covered the moon and she disappeared. Lolth arguably assisted Corellon but mostly by accident, entrapping Gruumsh in her web to prevent him following Corellon into Arvandor. In reality, this was an excuse for her magical lashing out at the fact he wasn't killed, and Gruumsh would have been halted by Arvandor's mystic defenses regardless.\n\n{{Fq\n| width  = 375px\n| source = The introduction to [[One-Eye]].\n| text   = In myth, Gruumsh lost his eye to his brother-in-origin, Corellon. He was following his idiotic pride (long had Gruumsh envied Corellon's grasp of magic, his beauty, and his fixed domains) when he charged cornea-first into the fray. With his maiming, Gruumsh presents the singular mythological case where an eye - usually a symbol of insight and greater knowledge - was sacrificed on the altar of utter stupidity.\n}}\n\nSo did the final phase of this battle of gods commence, Gruumsh with his spear and Corellon with his blade. While Corellon could not equal Gruumsh's attacks, he could dodge, parry, and get in close despite Gruumsh's attempts to keep him at bay. The orc god managed to blow him back with the spear's hilt long enough to switch to a dagger and axe, yet Gruumsh still could not properly strike Corellon. Sahandrian would not break again, and even against two weapons Corellon was too agile for his guard to be broken, preventing Gruumsh from bringing his full strength to bear. Sensing the turning tide of battle, Corellon made his move, thrusting his sword so Gruumsh could only block with his arm. Too late did Gruumsh realize his dagger remained in his hand; Sahndrian sunk between his arm bones, and drove Gruumsh's weapon into his eye.",
            "Retreat": "{{fq\n| width  = 300px\n|text= Yet another sign of Corellon’s weakness. He should have slain the orc when he had the chance. I would have. Or, at the very least, I would have gelded him!\n|source= Lolth commenting on Corellon sparing Gruumsh's life.\n}}\n\nAll sensation was erased from Gruumsh's mind in a burst of white-hot pain. Corellon simply regarded his foe, uncertain of whether or not the fight was over as Gruumsh spoke out against him. The orc threatened and swore at the Protector, whose own fortitude was beginning to falter from his various injuries, promising him eternal misery and the destruction of all he created. Unsure if Gruumsh could live up to his promise of continuing the fight, Corellon left, back towards Arvandor. Gruumsh's other injuries would heal, and quickly at that, but he would remain half-blinded for all time.\n\nSome said that Corellon made particularly sure to twist his blade so that Gruumsh's eye would never heal, and that in fact it was the cause of the meeting. In this tale, Corellon knew Gruumsh's eye gave him his prescient powers, and at great personal cost had secured knowledge on how to strip this power from him. Never, neither at the battle's start or end, did he plan on killing the orc; assuming that he could, he didn't want to (perhaps out of some sense of divine kinship, whether one believed the stories of their relatedness or not). Neither would it be honorable to slay an unarmed or wounded foe, a dishonor that Sehanine herself would be bound to report.\n\nStanding once more, Gruumsh attempted to track down Corellon, expressly planning to fight him if he still stood or slay him where he layed. Even if not for Arvandor's natural defenses, he was stopped by Lolth, caught as a fly in the Weaver's conjured web. She would attempt to gain information out of the One-Eye, but Gruumsh would have none of it, especially after his defeat and subsequent capture at her hands. Fact or fiction, their history cast aside, Gruumsh denied her, and counted her as a foe ever since.\n\nWith Corellon beyond his reach (an arguable retreat on the elven god's part), Gruumsh was left to leave Arborea on his own. The connection was but a rumor however, as was the blood's alleged link to the one-eyed [[cyclops]]es.\n\nWhether or not one believed that Gruumsh won the battle, elves and orcs thought of this (albeit incorrectly) as the genesis of the latter race. nursing his hatred for him below the earth. Just as Corellon's blood (mixed with Sehanine's tears) formed the souls of new elves, In his most painful hour, his race of special servitors that would bring destruction to Corellon's works, the vision he had foreseen, would come to pass.",
            "Birthright": "The creation legends of the various demihuman (including elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings) and human peoples stressed the importance of the deal their gods had with one another about allocated living spaces in the world. The greatest gods created and/or shaped the worlds, and in them Corellon took the woodlands, Moradin the mountains, Garl the hills, and [[Yondalla]] the meadows, with the protean humans allowed to live wherever they could thrive. The gods were in agreement regarding their peoples places and it was deemed good; not so in the myths of the orcs.\n\nIn the myths of pre-history constantly retold by their shamans, the orcs held to the\n\nIt was important to note that even in some elven myths of this ancient story, where the gods agreed on dominions rather than selecting them randomly, the element of there being no good territories remaining for Gruumsh remained. In non-orc legends he was said to have emerged from the shadows of the Underdark, almost always being the one to bring strife into the world through his violence and fell creatures. Indeed, in elven myths it was the hatred he introduced through the Godswar that resulted in the gods secretly encouraging their people to spread beyond their chosen borders. In any case, Gruumsh's divine fury was said to have been respected by his fellow gods in the past, and yet in this moment he felt himself and his chosen people cast aside without respect, robbed of a place in the world.\n\n[[File:GruumshSmite.png|thumb|right|450px|Gruumsh destroying the world to make lands for his people.]]\nAt first Gruumsh was silent, but then he lifted his spear over the world and unleashed a furious bellow. So did Gruumsh pierce the mountains, lay waste to the green hills, gouge the meadows and burn the forests. He made chasms, rifts, caves, badlands, barren wastes, and blighted glades for his followers to inhabit (although in some he just takes the caves, cliffs, and dark places no one else wants and plots vengeance from there). Then did Gruumsh swear that his people would avenge themselves by taking other lands for themselves, declaring total war against the other gods (especially the Seldarine and [[Morndinsamman]], whose forests and mountains he would have chosen second and first respectively and who he felt particularly cheated by) and that a time would come when orcs ruled the world.",
            "Acheron": "Over the course of history, Gruumsh and his pantheon had always been without a permanent home, It is unclear if the gods mentioned in [[Dragon magazine 62]], [[Monster Mythology]], and [[Faiths and Pantheons]] are meant to be the same deities. This might have been because they conspired to depose Gruumsh (since then he ruled the others tyrannically) and were destroyed utterly, or the result of Ilneval undermining and systematically destroying them. The Crafty Warrior's scheming saw other (possibly the same or including the same) orc gods relegated to lesser status in his climb to power, and it was letting his pantheon members fight amongst themselves that saw them removed from the Hells.\n\nForced to leave their territories in the other planes of lawful evil, Neither side would move to another dull cube or share the current one, fighting for centuries to secure one dismal hill only to lose it again the next decade. So it continued until the cubes were separated, not that this ceased the feud between the rival powers.",
            "Orcgate Wars": "Gruumsh's pantheon suffered even more casualties with the advent of the [[Orcgate Wars]]. In [[-1076 DR]], on a southern portion of the [[Plateau of Thay]], a horde of orcs was unleashed, quickly overrunning the territories of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]]. The orcs were from another world, having discovered a massive [[Gate]] opened years earlier by the rebel [[wizard]] [[Thayd]]. The god-kings of those lands mustered opposing armies and charged against them, and in response the orc shamans (using magic since lost to their descendants) summoned avatars of their own gods to counterattack.\n\nThe war would rage on for the next four years, culminating in heavy losses on the sides of both armies. Despite enemy tactics, the orcs nearly overwhelmed the hastily assembled human forces, who only survived by the grace of [[Re]], Lord of Sun and leader of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], blinding the orc army. It was then that Gruumsh and his divine allies charged forward, and at great personal cost to themselves, slew the god-king of Mulhorand, thus committing the first act of deicide in the Realms.\n\nRe's death was not in vain however, for [[Anhur]], Lord of War, had devised a brilliant trap. The elite forces of both Unther and Mulhorand had been held in reserve up until this point, and once the orcs charged had smashed into their flanks. The orc was army scattered and Gruumsh, along with the rest of his pantheon, was forced to retreat. the price of this unprovoked conflict was steep. Many gods and divine manifestations from his side had died as well, and those that hadn't were severely weakened from the fight against Re.",
            "Recent History": "The problems for the orc gods did not stop in Faerun's ancient past. During the [[Time of Troubles]], the travel god [[Shaundakul]] was said to have slain at least one demipower, possibly of orcish origin, in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. His position did improve with the advent of the World Tree Cosmology however, where Nishrek was its own domain not constantly beset by goblinoid hosts, even if the wars just turned inwards.\n\n[[File:Gruumsh symbol - Mike Schely.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gruumsh's symbol during the Spellplague]]\nThe [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] and the decades preceding it saw a further flourishing of Gruumsh's influence. The orc population grew and more humanoids fell under his sway as he put his own pantheon and other minor deities of savage races under his control.\n\nUnfortunately for Gruumsh, this supremacy did not last. Over the course of the [[Second Sundering]] he lost his Talos aspect and Maglubiyet had broken free of Bane's control, their eternal war in Acheron recommencing. Furthermore, his control over his own pantheon had waned, as it was around this time when Luthic's secret romance with Grumbar was uncovered.\n\nThe [[archmage]] [[Tzunk]] went so far as to predict that the Cave Mother would outlast Gruumsh in the war against Maglubiyet, surpassing even her husband in ferocity when her children were threatened. Where Gruumsh saw the war simply as an opportunity for glorious battle, she took a longer view of the conflict, understanding its cosmic implications for the orcs. Tzunk predicted that the war would end with her the last god standing, ascending to rule her warrior children.\n\n[[File:CvsGAgain.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Gruumsh and Corellon clash yet again.]]\nRegardless of his future, Gruumsh was still a powerful, destructive force in the multiverse. He swore revenge against all other gods for their alleged crimes against him, and Corellon above all others for maiming and robbing him of his own powers of premonition. Thus would the One-Eyed God continue his eternal war of vengeance against his peers; he remained a threat into the modern era, too treacherous to be dealt with and far too angry to be ignored."
