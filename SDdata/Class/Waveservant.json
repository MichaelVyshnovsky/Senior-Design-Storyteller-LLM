        "mainbody": "aveservants were specialty priests devoted to Umberlee, the Bitch Queen. \nThese specialty priests were both male and female and primarily humans.\nThey served as enforcers and tribute gatherers of the Bitch Queen. They were typically solitary individuals, with some living on stormy islands and coastlines, while others spent their entire lives on ships. Many earned their livelihood as pirates, targeting merchant ships that failed to offer adequate tribute to their goddess. They seldom strayed far from large bodies of water.\nIn addition to their normal spells, waveservants could cast watery double, striking wave, and control weather on a daily basis. They could water walk and breathe while under water at will. They were also able to move through water as if wearing a ring of free action. If located in an appropriate area, waveservants could summon up to four shark servants per day. A waveservant could not turn or command undead unless the undead died while at sea or were \"natural\" aquatic forms of undead such as lacedons.\nIn addition to bludgeoning weapons, waveservants often wielded tridents, harpoons, and a special dueling knife. The heaviest armor they wore was leather armor and some carried a shield."
