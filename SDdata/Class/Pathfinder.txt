'''Pathfinders''' were bold scouts and [[ranger]]s dedicated to finding pathways for others to follow. Pathfinders did this through their superior perception but also through their battle prowess, which allowed them to carve a path if none was available.

==Activities==
Pathfinders sometimes worked as retainers for various lords and kings, though more often worked independently. They often joined [[adventuring companies]] on quests to promote the common good, rarely doing so purely for personal gain. In adventuring companies they often found themselves moving ahead of their companions, scouting ahead to ascertain any hazards and the best route for their party to take.

==Culture==
Some [[half-elf]] [[Windwalker (class)|windwalkers]], [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Faer√ªn]]ian god of exploration and travel, chose to follow the [[Church of Shaundakul]]'s dogma by being pathfinder rangers.<ref>

==Abilities==
In order to survive their dangerous treks through the wilderness, pathfinders honed their combat skills intensively. At an early age, pathfinders learned to make the most of their physical capabilities, allowing them to endure long after others would collapse or perish. With more advanced training pathfinders became so confident in their abilities that they appeared to grow more powerful with each blow they deal against their quarry. Additionally, since their role was that of a scout rather than a long-term combatant, pathfinders relied on staying mobile throughout a battle.

==Possessions==
A pathfinder typically wielded weaponry that could aid in clearing paths or cutting away brush, such as [[sword]]s, [[hand axe]]s, and [[machete]]s. Because they spent a lot of time on the go, a pathfinder preferred lightweight armors such as [[leather armor|leather]] or [[padded armor]].
