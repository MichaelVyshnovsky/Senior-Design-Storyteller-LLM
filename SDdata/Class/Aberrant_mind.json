        "mainbody": "berrant mind sorcerers were those arcane spellcasters that possessed potent psionic abilities that originated from alien powers and entities far removed from the natural world of Toril.\nSome of these sorcerers gained their powers from the planes beyond the Prime Material, such as the reality-warping energies of the Far Realm or the infinite expanse of the Astral Plane. Yet others were touched by otherworldly beings, like the mind flayers that originated from wildspace or the aboleths that dwelled within the depths of the Underdark.\nThrough their supernatural powers, aberrant mind sorcerers gained access to spells that manipulated the minds of others, such as mind sliver, calm emotions, and detect thoughts, along with others like arms of Hadar and Evards black tentacles that drew upon powers from beyond. They also possessed an inherent form of telepathy that allowed for non-verbal communication with others for a limited time over the span of one or more miles. \nBy tapping into their inner reserves, experienced sorcerers learned to cast some magic differently from arcane spellcasters. They did not require verbal or somatic components when casting certain spells, and only needed material components if they were consumed during casting. As their psionic-like spellcasting became more potent, so did their defenses against psychic assaults. Aberrant mind sorcerers became well-defended against attacks upon their psyche and gained resilience to charming or frightening effects. \nAs they increased in power, sorcerers gained the ability to mutate their body into an aberration-like being, one whose form better reflected their sorcerous origin. During this transformation, their physical form took on one of several powers or properties it gained ability to see invisible creatures, acquired supernatural flight, grew functional gills and webbed appendages that facilitated rapid swimming, or became increasingly elastic and covered in some manner of slime-like substance. \nThe most impressive aberrant mind sorcerers learned how to manifest anomalies that warped space and gravity around it. Any creature that could not resist its effects was pulled into the anomaly, and crushed by intense waves of force energy."
