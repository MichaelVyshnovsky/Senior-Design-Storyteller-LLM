'''Martyred champions of Ilmater''' were followers of [[Ilmater]] who had heroically sacrificed themselves in accordance with the Broken God's teachings and returned to life to continue along the same path, ready to sacrifice themselves again if need be. As such, they sought to follow in the footsteps of [[St. Sollars|St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred]] and [[St. Ulrach|St. Ulrach the Twice Martyred]].

==Culture==
These martyrs were highly revered, even venerated, and they lay outside the hierarchy of the [[Church of Ilmater]], operating as free agents. Such people were heroes of the struggle against evil and suffering, and they were completely devoted to Ilmater's teachings.

==Entry==
A would-be martyr was typically very skilled in some field and familiar with matters of faith, hardy and enduring, of a [[lawful good|good and lawful]] disposition, and blessed and illuminated by the good powers. However, most of all, they must be a follower of Ilmater and have died in sacrifice and been resurrected.

==Abilities==
Any person could become a martyred champion, because anyone could find themselves made a martyr. Therefore, the path of the martyred champion offered varied benefits to those who dared take it, allowing them to continue advancing their [[spell]]casting or to learn to practice other great feats as they chose.

Some abilities, however, were common to all. First, a martyred champion was understandably increasingly very difficult to kill again. They could take blows or injuries that would otherwise knock them unconscious, and still stay active. They had a divinely enhanced ability to endure suffering and strive against the odds. Later, a champion's faith strengthened their ability to withstand adversity. Thanks to their holy suffering, if they took a blow that could kill a person, and they survived, then Ilmater blessed them for it, enhancing resistances, skills, and their ability to deal back the punishment they'd taken. Finally, a martyred champion could shrug off all but the most serious injuries, unless they came from an [[evil]] weapon.

A martyred champion could fight empty-handed just like their patron deity, and trained in the unarmed martial arts. They struck with greater force as they advanced in their training.

A martyred champion knew no fear, whether caused by magic or from within their own minds.

The greatest martyred champions were on speaking terms with their god. Once a day, they were able to engage in a communion with Ilmater and be permitted to ask the Crying God a single question, similar to a ''[[commune]]'' spell, though at some personal cost.

The highest martyred champions could forgo the need to eat, drink, or even breathe altogether. They still felt the pain of starvation, thirst, or suffocation if they did, but they put their minds above such trivial concerns.
