        "mainbody": "A '''sword''' was a specialty [[priest]] of the [[Church of Cyric]] who was tasked with spreading strife, disaster, and deception throughout [[Faer√ªn]].<ref name=\"WaPotR-p74\" >",
        "Activities": "Cyric's swords were militant priests who openly battled the clergy of other [[deities]]. A sword would usually attack anyone wearing the [[holy symbol]] of a good-natured god. The sword's personality determined whether that action would be an outright attack, or something with a little more subterfuge.",
        "Culture": "Swords were always tense as if waiting for a reason to kill someone around them, which always stood a chance of happening.",
        "Abilities": "Swords were quite adept and moving about silently and using shadows to conceal their location. They were also skilled in the art of backstabbing. The hatred experienced when a sword viewed another god's holy symbol translated well during combat, making it slightly easier for them to strike and harm their opponents.\n\nSwords were openly despised in [[Zhentil Keep]] and throughout the [[Moonsea]], [[Dalelands]], and [[Cormyr]]. Swords could not cast [[spell]]s from the [[healing sphere]], nor could they [[turn undead|turn or command undead]].",
        "Possessions": "Given their frequent martial conflicts, swords were always wearing either [[chainmail]], [[scale armor]], or [[plate mail]] with a purple tabard. They wielded [[longsword]]s or [[dagger]]s during combat."
