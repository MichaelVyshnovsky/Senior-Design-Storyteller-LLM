'''Questers''' were specialty [[priest]]s of the [[Church of Helm]] who were tasked by [[Helm|He of the Unsleeping Eyes]] to retrieve lost items and rescue kidnapped people.<ref name="WaPotR-p79" >

==Activities==
These individuals spent all of their time striving to complete their current objectives.

==Culture==
Questers were completely focused on their quests to rescue kidnapped victims or retrieve lost items. Anything or anyone standing in their way of achieving these goals was dealt with swiftly.

==Abilities==
Questers were very skilled at casting [[spell]]s from both the [[guardian|guardian sphere]] and [[protection sphere]]s. Their version of the ''[[locate object]]'' spell lasted for a full 24 hours.

They could not cast any spells from the [[Animal sphere|animal]] or [[plant sphere]]s.

==Possessions==
Quester wore [[plate mail|full plate mail]] with an open-faced [[helm]] adorned with a gold plume. Most also covered their [[armor]] with a gold tabard emblazoned with the eye of Helm centered on the chest. A quester could wield any weapon of their choice, but many favored the [[two-handed sword]].

==Relationships==
Due to Helm's role during the [[Time of Troubles]] in barring the gods from accessing the [[Celestial Staircase]]s and slaying [[Mystra]], Questers were not held in high regard in the [[Heartlands|northern Heartlands]].
