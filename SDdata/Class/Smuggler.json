        "mainbody": "'''Smugglers''' were a variety of [[rogue]] that specialized in the trafficking of goods (and sometimes people) into areas where they were considered illegal{{Cite adventurers league/State of Hillsfar|8}} to avoid seizure, or legal goods in order to avoid tariffs, a role that was vital to many black markets and criminal underworlds.",
        "Culture": "Smugglers would sneak into locations, such as by going on foot or through port under the cover of night, entering the waters by means of a [[canoe]] or [[rowboat]]. Alternatively, smugglers would have hidden compartments and false doors within their boats or [[wagon]]s for the purpose of hiding their illicit goods.\n\nWhen traveling through dangerous areas rife with bandits and monsters a freelance smuggler might hire the service of some thugs or [[mercenaries]] to protect them, otherwise they would have to resort to paying their harassers off with a cut of their merchandise in return for their safety. Though this never guaranteed their safety, as there was always a chance of being double-crossed. Because of this many smugglers were part of [[thieves' guild]]s, the [[Hillsfar Rogues' Guild]],{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|81}} which they could rely upon for muscle. Some charismatic smugglers even specialized in dealing diplomatically with other guilds. Smugglers also benefitted from the safehouses and secret routes that thieves' guilds had within their respective cities.\n\nSmugglers largely operated through [[fence]]s. They rarely, if ever, sold their goods directly. or fences themselves.\n\n[[File:Smuggler.png|thumb|232x232px|Someone smuggling supplies into [[Yartar]].]]\nIn [[Faerûn]] smugglers could be found in and around [[the Dalelands]] region,<ref> notably frequenting [[The Dragon's Tail]] in [[Scardale Town]],<ref> [[Cormyr]], [[Waterdeep]],<ref> Westgate,[[Polyhedron 110|''Polyhedron'' #110, \"Living City Character Generation,\"]] an article on character creation for the RPGA [[The Living City|Living City]] Campaign, had smugglers listed among the [[character kit]]s from ''[[The Complete Thief's Handbook]]'' as an acceptable option for [[thieves]]. A later article on character creation, \"Making a Living\" from [[Polyhedron 134|''Polyhedron'' #134]], also noted smugglers as an acceptable thief kit for the setting.\n\nBeyond Faerûn, in [[Zakhara]] smuggling was largely the domain of [[corsair (kit)|corsairs]],<ref> the nautical [[warrior]]s of the Land of Fate. And beyond [[Toril]], smugglers could be found on the [[Rock of Bral]].<ref>",
        "Possessions": "Smugglers used a great deal of the equipment and weapons that were in common use by other types of rogues, Some were also known to utilize [[forgery kit]]s.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a great deal of smugglers across the [[Sword Coast North]] did business with the [[Blackdagger Bandits]].",
        "Notable Smugglers": "* [[Coobert Draftworth]] and [[Norry Waywocket]], a duo of smugglers who also operated as fences, specializing in treasures that were small and easy-to-carry.\n* [[Flame (person)|Flame]], a person-trafficker and kidnapper who sometimes smuggled people out of places.<ref> \n* [[Folehar Flametree]], a [[halfling]] smuggler in [[Elturel]] who also operated as a merchant.\n* [[Ferret Jones]], a notorious smuggler that had earned the ire of the Zhentarim in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|311|\"Ferret\" Jones}}\n* [[Jaccob]], a halfling smuggler who eventually retired from that line of work to be a tourist guide in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].{{Cite polyhedron/121/Contests|22}}\n* [[Misker]], a [[beholder]] that ran a large smuggling operation out of [[Skullport]].\n* [[Violet Dindower]], a [[Waterdhavian]] halfling that took to a life of smuggling aboard a [[spelljammer]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|438|Violet Dindower}}"
