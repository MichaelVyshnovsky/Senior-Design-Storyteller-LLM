        "mainbody": "'''Riddlemasters''' were exceptionally intelligent [[bard]]s that devoted themselves to intellectual pursuits, becoming masters at conceiving and solving all manner of riddles, puzzles, and rhymes.",
        "Activities": "All riddlemasters shared the view that daily life could be navigated like any puzzle. From this mindset they sought to advance their intellectual understanding such as what were the best questions to ask\n\n[[Evil]]-aligned riddlemasters sought to demean and put down others, [[good]] ones sought to educate people, and others simply reveled in poking fun at other people. In general, many riddlemasters liked to flaunt their intellectual skills by speaking in riddles or rhymes and they loved to pose questions to commoners in the form of carefully constructed riddles. These riddle questions would conceal either lessons or observations that applied to the those being questioned. It was also custom among riddlemasters to not explain what seemed obvious to them unless asked direct, specific questions, but instead only offer one or two observations so that those around them could work their way to the conclusion themselves.\n\nThough most riddlemasters were too absorbed in intellectual pursuits to cultivate other skills, some became skilled in bartering, gambling, or the art of being a jeweler.",
        "Culture": "Some believed that the skills displayed by riddlemasters were nothing more than extraordinary luck, Also like jesters, many commoners labeled riddlemasters as being crazy due to their strange actions and behavior. Their way of living tended to irritate commoners and fellow [[adventurer]]s alike,<ref> necessitating a mobile lifestyle.",
        "Abilities": "Riddlemasters were more proficient than the average bard in learning new [[spell]]s and using spell [[scroll]]s or other other [[magic item]]s that were in written form, such as [[book]]s or [[map]]s.",
        "Equipment": "In terms of weaponry a riddlemaster favored those that required some level of finesse to use, such as [[blowgun]]s, [[bow]]s and [[crossbow]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s, [[hand axe]]s, [[javelin]]s, [[quarterstaves]], [[sling]]s and [[staff sling]]s, [[spear]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[whip]]s.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1364}},{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} riddlemasters were considered to be relatively rare in [[Faer√ªn]].\n\nSome time during or prior to 1364 DR, the riddle-hoarding [[green dragon]] [[Grimnoshtadrano]] destroyed the village of [[Taskerleigh]] near [[Waterdeep]] and from it took the magical [[harp]] ''[[Morninglark]]'', which he carried back to his lair in the [[High Forest]]. Soon thereafter, Grimnosh was approached by the [[spellsinger]] [[Iriador Wintermist]], under the alias of \"Garnet\", with a proposition: if she could have the ''Morninglark'', she would use it to issue a widely spread challenge for adventurers and riddlemasters to approach Grimnosh with their best riddles. Grimnosh agreed and received a scroll from Garnet to give to anyone who succeeded at the challenge.\n\nSoon enough, a rag-tag army of adventurers, [[minstrel]]s, and [[mercenaries]] led by [[Danilo Thann]] and [[Elaith Craulnober]], accompanied by the riddlemaster Vartain, sought out the lair of Grimnosh in order to obtain the ''Morninglark'' for themselves.",
        "Notable Riddlemasters": "* [[Elvira of the Bluff]], a [[Ravenian]] [[half-elf]] bard and [[mage]], was referred to by some as being a riddlemaster.<ref>\n* [[Vartain]], a widely traveled [[human]] riddlemaster that hailed from [[Calimshan]]."
