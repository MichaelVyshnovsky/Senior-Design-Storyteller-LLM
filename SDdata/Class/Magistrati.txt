'''Magistrati''', also known as '''magistrata''', were specialty priests devoted to [[Azuth]], the Lord of Spells.

==Activities==
As with all of Azuth's clergy, magistrati sometimes served as neutral messengers between [[wizard]]s. They also helped organize annual [[magefair]]s. Magistrati encouraged wizards to share unique spells with others so that knowledge of the spell would not vanish when the wizard died.

==Abilities==
Magistrati were able to cast their [[divine magic]] [[spell]]s much quicker than non-Azuthan priests. All magistrati were capable of casting [[arcane magic]] spells nearly as soon as they joined the clergy. They prayed for these wizards spells just as they did for their clerical spells as opposed to memorizing them like a wizard. With the exception of the ''[[read magic]]'' spell, which was always available, a magistrati could only cast wizard spells from one [[school of magic]]. This school was chosen by the magistrati when they prayed for their very first wizard spell.

Magistrati could use magic [[scroll]]s usually only available to wizards. A ''read magic'' spell was required to use the scroll if the spell it contained was different from their chosen school of magic.

A magistrati could ''[[identify]]'' [[magic item]]s by touch. This magic lasted for five minutes and could only be used once per item. Use of this power did not activate any [[curse]]s held within the item.

Depending on their progression within the clergy, a magistrati could cast the following spells once per day as a granted power that did not affect the number of spells they could cast during the dayâ€“''[[magic missile]], [[fireball]], [[lightning bolt]], [[wall of fire]], [[wall of ice]], [[wall of stone]], [[wall of iron]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]''.

==Possessions==
A magistrati was permitted to wield blunt weapons. They did not wear [[armor]] of any kind. Because of their association with Azuth, magistrati were capable of using magic items usually only wielded by wizards.
