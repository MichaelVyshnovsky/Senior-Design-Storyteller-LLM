Magistrati, also known as magistrata, were specialty priests devoted to Azuth, the Lord of Spells.
As with all of Azuths clergy, magistrati sometimes served as neutral messengers between wizards. They also helped organize annual magefairs. Magistrati encouraged wizards to share unique spells with others so that knowledge of the spell would not vanish when the wizard died.
Magistrati were able to cast their divine magic spells much quicker than non-Azuthan priests. All magistrati were capable of casting arcane magic spells nearly as soon as they joined the clergy. They prayed for these wizards spells just as they did for their clerical spells as opposed to memorizing them like a wizard. With the exception of the read magic spell, which was always available, a magistrati could only cast wizard spells from one school of magic. This school was chosen by the magistrati when they prayed for their very first wizard spell.
Magistrati could use magic scrolls usually only available to wizards. A read magic spell was required to use the scroll if the spell it contained was different from their chosen school of magic.
A magistrati could identify magic items by touch. This magic lasted for five minutes and could only be used once per item. Use of this power did not activate any curses held within the item.
Depending on their progression within the clergy, a magistrati could cast the following spells once per day as a granted power that did not affect the number of spells they could cast during the dayâ€“magic missile, fireball, lightning bolt, wall of fire, wall of ice, wall of stone, wall of iron, and wall of force.
A magistrati was permitted to wield blunt weapons. They did not wear armor of any kind. Because of their association with Azuth, magistrati were capable of using magic items usually only wielded by wizards.
