The '''Order domain''' was a [[domain]] granted by [[deity|deities]] associated with discipline and obedience, with respect for method and hierarchy above all else.

==Deities==
{{ListDeitiesByDomain|{{PAGENAME}}}}

==Spells==
[[Cleric]]s who chose this domain were granted free access to these spells (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance): ''[[command]]'', ''[[heroism]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[zone of truth]]'', ''[[mass healing word]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[compulsion]]'', ''[[locate creature]]'', ''[[commune]]'', and ''[[dominate person]]''.

==Other Powers==
In addition, Order domain clerics gained access to the following powers:

===Channel Divinity===
Clerics with the Order domain gained the ability to use the [[channel divinity]] power called ''[[order's demand]]'', which allowed the caster to exert a commanding influence over others.

===Other Powers===
Other abilities included ''voice of authority'', which could command immediate actions from an ally in the battlefield; ''embodiment of the law'', which empowered [[magic]] from the [[enchantment]] school aimed at controlling others; ''divine strike'', which infused a [[weapon]] with divine energy so it also dealt damage to its target's mind; and ''order's wrath'', which cursed a designated creature to waste away at each of the cleric's allies' strikes.
