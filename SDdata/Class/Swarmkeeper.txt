'''Swarmkeepers''' were [[ranger]]s that specifically bonded with swarming [[nature spirit]]s that appeared throughout the Realms.

{{Quote|When he's threatened, the forest buzzes and the air hums with [[dragonfly]] wings.|Anonymous.}}

==Activities==
There were some known swarmkeepers that dwelled within the [[Cloak Wood]] forest on the [[Sword Coast]].{{Cite MTG|CLB|222|[[Cloakwood]] [[Swarmkeeper]]|[[Yangtian Li]]}}

==Culture==
Some swarmkeepers preferred a solitary lifestyle away from civilization, free from the obligation of dealing with other people. Yet others used their powers to form and strengthen bonds with other members of their community, utilizing their swarms for the benefit of their fellows.

==Abilities==
A keepers' bond of nature spirits could manifest in a variety of different forms, including: a swarm of insects (such as [[dragonfly|dragonflies]]), a horde of small-sized [[twig blight]]s, a flock of birds, or a group of [[pixie]]s, among others. These spirits assisted their keepers by helping carry or ''[[teleport]]'' them limited distances, attacking or knocking back their foes, or engulfing their body to deflect any oncoming attacks.

Experienced keepers could guide their swarm with expert control, directing them to ''[[mage hand|manipulate objects]]'' a distance away, surround their foes so they were ''[[faerie fire|easier to strike]]'', ''[[web|pin them in place]]'', or even inflict ''[[insect plague|physical harm]]''. Additionally, these spirits could ''[[arcane eye|observe far away areas]]'' for their keeper, or even envelop them, allowing them to ''[[gaseous form|become insubstantial]]'' for a time.
