        "mainbody": "A crusader is a warrior in the service of a deity who acts according to a certain code.\nCrusaders are rare warriors who are in the highest favors of their chosen deities. These warriors are true zealots, striking in the name of their chosen causes with fury. A crusader will never betray her chosen cause willingly, and is a devastating warrior on the battlefield. Each crusader is bound to an alignment, be it order, good, evil, or chaos.\nThese warriors gain extra accuracy and skill if they are harmed or injured in battle. A crusader also gains many powerful divine abilities and maneuvers, which they cannot select when to use, but their God grants them in the course of a combat. The maneuvers are rejuvenated by meditating for five minutes.\nCategoryClasses\n7w6h8dvrahbjwptg7z7f8snes7775bb"
