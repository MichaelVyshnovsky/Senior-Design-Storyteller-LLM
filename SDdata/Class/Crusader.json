        "Culture": "Crusaders are rare warriors who are in the highest favors of their chosen deities. These warriors are true zealots, striking in the name of their chosen causes with fury. A crusader will never betray her chosen cause willingly, and is a devastating warrior on the battlefield. Each crusader is bound to an alignment, be it order, [[good]], [[evil]], or chaos.",
        "Abilities": "These warriors gain extra accuracy and skill if they are harmed or injured in battle. A crusader also gains many powerful divine abilities and maneuvers, which they cannot select when to use, but their God grants them in the course of a combat. The maneuvers are rejuvenated by meditating for five minutes.",
