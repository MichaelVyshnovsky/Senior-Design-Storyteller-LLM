        "mainbody": "Shadowcasters were a class of magic user that focused on using shadow magic.\nShadowcasting required its practioners to be both cunning and intelligent, with disciplined minds and strong wills. Shadowcasters learned to master what they called fundamentals and and mysteries, rather than spells. Fundamentals were relatively simple, but mysteries ranged in difficulty and formed paths of mastery. However, this arrangement of paths meant that shadowcasters tended to be limited in versatility. The flip side was that because of its nature and rarity, shadowcasters mysteries tended to be difficult to recognize, let alone disrupt or dispel.\nMore powerful shadowcasters displayed an interesting bond with the Plane of Shadow, acquiring simple darkvision in just a short time (or extended darkvision if they naturally possessed it), and more powerful darkvision capable of seeing even through magical darkness as their power increased. Even more curiously, the shadow magic would begin to sustain a shadowcaster in place of food, drink, and eventually air.\nSome shadowcasters would specialize, various becoming children of night, masters of shadow, noctumancers, shadowblades, shadowsmiths, or shadow adepts.\nShadowcasters tended to be secretive and studious, spending most of their time either meditating or studying their magic.\nOther spellcasters typically disliked shadowcasters for their strange magic, and clerical reactions towards shadowcasters tended to be mixed at the least."
