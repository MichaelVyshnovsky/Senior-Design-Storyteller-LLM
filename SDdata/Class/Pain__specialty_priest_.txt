'''Pains''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Loviatar]], the Maiden of Pain.

==Culture==
Pains were both male and female and could be any race.

==Abilities==
These individuals could use a ''pain touch'' on any target, wracking them with intense pain for several minutes depending on the skill and rank of the pain who touched them. Pains could cast a number of [[spell]]s on a daily basis including ''[[whip of pain]]'', ''[[dance of pain]]'', ''[[Loviatar's caress]]'', ''[[kiss of torment]]'', ''[[eyebite]]'', and ''[[symbol]]''. Particularly powerful pains could cast ''[[ensnarement]]'' once per month.

==Possessions==
In addition to either a [[whip]] or [[scourge]], pains wielded bludgeoning weapons in combat. The heaviest [[armor]] they were permitted to wear was [[scale mail]], preferably pleated ceremonial scale mail, and some carried a [[shield]].
