Pains were specialty priests devoted to Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain.
Pains were both male and female and could be any race.
These individuals could use a pain touch on any target, wracking them with intense pain for several minutes depending on the skill and rank of the pain who touched them. Pains could cast a number of spells on a daily basis including whip of pain, dance of pain, Loviatars caress, kiss of torment, eyebite, and symbol. Particularly powerful pains could cast ensnarement once per month.
In addition to either a whip or scourge, pains wielded bludgeoning weapons in combat. The heaviest armor they were permitted to wear was scale mail, preferably pleated ceremonial scale mail, and some carried a shield.
