'''Thalornor''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Sharindlar]], the Lady of Life.

==Culture==
The majority of thalornor were [[shield dwarves]] or [[gold dwarves]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, both male and female, could become a thalornar.

==Abilities==
Thalornor were skilled herbalists and healers.

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, thalornor could cast ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[aid]]'', ''[[merciful touch]]'', ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', ''[[cure critical wounds]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[flowstone]]'', and ''[[word of recall]]'' on a daily basis. Additionally, they could cast ''[[detect dwarves]]'' at will and ''[[gate]]'' twice per tenday.

==Possessions==
Thalornor did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were allowed to wear. They were permitted to wield bludgeoning weapons and [[knives]].
