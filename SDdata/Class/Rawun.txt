'''Rawuns''' ({{Plural|rawunin}}) were the [[bard]]s and storytellers of the desert in [[Zakhara]]. They used epic poems to spread the legends of their tribe.

Rawunin sometimes grouped together to form a ''[[Midani dictionary|takht]]'', allowing for a greater range of detailed performances.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

==Requirements==
Only [[human]]s and [[half-elves]] could become bards, and only a bard could be a rawun.

==Role==
Rawunin had strong memories and stronger voices. They were the keepers and spreaders of knowledge in the Land of Fate. Rawuns in urban areas were often well-read.

==Possessions==
Many rawun were drawn to collecting books and scrolls wherever they could find them.

Rawun with a degree of musical talent tended to prefer instruments that left their mouths free to narrate as story as they played.

==Skills==
These individuals were adept at determining the magical properties of items. Once per day they could cause the ''[[evil eye]]'' to fall upon someone or remove it from a person.

Rawuns were only able to use [[universal spell]]s in Zakhara.
