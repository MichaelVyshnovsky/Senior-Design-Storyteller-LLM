Rawuns () were the bards and storytellers of the desert in Zakhara. They used epic poems to spread the legends of their tribe.
Rawunin sometimes grouped together to form a takht, allowing for a greater range of detailed performances.
Only humans and half-elves could become bards, and only a bard could be a rawun.
Rawunin had strong memories and stronger voices. They were the keepers and spreaders of knowledge in the Land of Fate. Rawuns in urban areas were often well-read.
Many rawun were drawn to collecting books and scrolls wherever they could find them.
Rawun with a degree of musical talent tended to prefer instruments that left their mouths free to narrate as story as they played.
These individuals were adept at determining the magical properties of items. Once per day they could cause the evil eye to fall upon someone or remove it from a person.
Rawuns were only able to use universal spells in Zakhara.
