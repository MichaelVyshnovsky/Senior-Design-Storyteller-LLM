        "mainbody": "uills were specialty priests of the Church of Oghma who collected and recorded knowledge.\nGiven the amount of time spent recording various forms of knowledge, quills were usually well-versed with the history of their region.\nQuills prided themselves on their diligence to their duties. They usually possessed an impressive memory and had a pleasing speaking voice.\nQuills usually had all of the items required to write magical clerical scrolls.\nSpells from both the combat and necromantic spheres were denied to a quill, nor could they turn undead.\nQuills dressed similar to holy singers with a white tunic and pants and a black gold-trimmed vest. Their hat was small and box-like. Many quills also wore a sleeve protector on the forearm of their writing arm to protect their clothes from ink stains. These were sometimes decorated and served as a badge of office.\nThey spent very little time with martial training, thus they usually only carried smaller weapons, such as daggers. Lighter armor such as leather armor could also be worn."
