        "Abilities": "Quills usually had all of the items required to write magical clerical [[scroll]]s.\n\n[[Spell]]s from both the [[Combat sphere|combat]] and [[necromantic sphere]]s were denied to a quill, nor could they [[turn undead]].",
        "Possessions": "Quills dressed similar to [[holy singer]]s with a white [[tunic]] and pants and a black [[gold]]-trimmed vest. Their hat was small and box-like. Many quills also wore a sleeve protector on the forearm of their writing arm to protect their clothes from [[ink]] stains. These were sometimes decorated and served as a badge of office.\n\nThey spent very little time with martial training, thus they usually only carried smaller weapons, such as [[dagger]]s. Lighter [[armor]] such as [[leather armor]] could also be worn."
