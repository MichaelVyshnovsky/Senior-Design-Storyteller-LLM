        "mainbody": "'''Ajami''' were alien [[wizard]]s in [[Zakhara]].<ref group=\"note\">Ajami was a [[wizard]] class kit for the [[Al-Qadim]] setting. The word \"ajami\" can also mean \"outlander\" in general in [[Midani]].",
        "Requirements": "Ajamis had no special requirements.",
        "Role": "Zakharans treated all outsiders with suspicion, but they were especially wary of those who wielded more power.",
        "Possessions": "Ajamis typically had foreign equipment. Replacing such outland equipment while in Zakhara usually cost at least five times the item's value.",
        "Benefits": "Ajamis were able to learn new universal Zakharan [[spell]]s.",
        "Hindrances": "New Zakharan magic was impossible for ajamis to learn without taking drastic measures.  Even \"regular\" spells such as ''fireball'' were beyond their reach because the Zakharan ''fireball'' was based on the elemental \"flame\" magic unique to the [[Zakhara|Land of Fate]]. Only alien elementalists could learn spells from the equivalent Zakharan element.\n\nAjamis desperate to learn Zakharan magic could abandon their outsider practices and begin study of Zakharan magic but at the cost of forever losing access to all previous spells they learned.",
