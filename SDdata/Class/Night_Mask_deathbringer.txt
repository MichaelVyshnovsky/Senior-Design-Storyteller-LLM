'''Night Mask deathbringers''' were elite agents of the [[Night Masks]] in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Night Mask deathbringers served the leadership of the Night Masks as their most elite assassins and lieutenants. They were feared by the natives of [[Westgate]], and were hungry for power in their own right.

The [[vampire|vampiric]] leadership of the Night Masks created the deathbringers as unique intermediaries between themselves and those outside of the guild. Using the inherent strength in their blood, [[Orbakh|The Faceless]] and his [[Night Masters]] chose elite members of the Night Masks to become bizarre hybrids, neither fully mortal nor truly [[undead]]. These creatures were the deathbringers, and they learned to harness their new powers to aid their own quests for power and to increase the might of the Night Masks as a whole.

==Abilities==
Night Mask deathbringers exuded auras of death, which made all animals (except for [[bat]]s, [[wolves]], and [[rat]]s) uncomfortable.

These evil agents could use the power of their partially undead body to crawl along walls and ceilings. In addition, Night Mask deathbringers could cause others to become [[charm]]ed. The charmed victims became fully under the deathbringers' commands by being fed three drops of the deathbringers' own blood. This charm became more powerful as the deathbringers became more experienced.
