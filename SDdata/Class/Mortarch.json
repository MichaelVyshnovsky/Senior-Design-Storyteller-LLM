        "Activities": "Mortarchs were specialized in the arts of funerals. Their main duties were to consecrate graves, maintain and pass on knowledge regarding burial customs, and to provide comfort to the grieving family members of the deceased.",
        "Abilities": "Mortarchs used a unique version of the ''[[bless]]'' spell, which was cast on graves both to prevent the buried corpse from becoming [[undead]] and also to keep undead creatures away. This effect lasted a full year. Mortarchs were capable of ''[[Turn undead|turning]]'' undead creatures more powerful than themselves. They were unable to cast ''[[raise dead]]'' or ''[[resurrection]]'' or wield any [[magic]]al item that duplicated the effects of those spells.",
        "Possessions": "The dress of a mortarch were robes of dark blue and grey. They also wore a circlet of [[silver]]. The weapons carried by the priests were [[club]]s, [[flail]]s, or [[mace]]s, which were always carefully concealed under these robes, in respect for mourners.",
        "Notable Mortarchs": "* [[Gracie Scyre]], a mortarch in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>"
