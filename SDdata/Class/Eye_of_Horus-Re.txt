The '''Eye of Horus-Re''' was a special class of [[cleric]]s faithful to the chief deity of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], [[Horus-Re]].

Among their ranks were those who crusaded against servants of [[Set]] and their [[undead]] minions. Unlike other organizations of [[Mulhorand]], they were not tied to the [[pharaoh]] and followed their own hierarchical structure. They could be found in any place where followers of Set or the undead existed.<ref>
