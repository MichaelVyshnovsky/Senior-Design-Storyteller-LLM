The Eye of Horus-Re was a special class of clerics faithful to the chief deity of the Mulhorandi pantheon, Horus-Re.
Among their ranks were those who crusaded against servants of Set and their undead minions. Unlike other organizations of Mulhorand, they were not tied to the pharaoh and followed their own hierarchical structure. They could be found in any place where followers of Set or the undead existed.
