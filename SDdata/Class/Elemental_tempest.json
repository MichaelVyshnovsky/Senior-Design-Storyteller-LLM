        "mainbody": "'''Elemental tempests''', which were also sometimes called '''tempests'''{{Cite dragon/367/Ecology of the Genasi|14}} or '''Genasi tempests''',{{Cite dragon/367/Ecology of the Genasi|21}} were [[Genasi]] capable of manifesting two elemental forms simultaneously. This was an unusual talent amongst their race. Unlike most Genasi, who typically had a single, dominant elemental manifestation, elemental tempests embraced the chaos that fueled their physical nature. As a result, elemental tempests were inconstant and passionate individuals capable of both vast power and an unusual amount of versatility.",
        "Culture": "Because manifestations were so closely tied to a Genasi's appearance and psychology, elemental tempests were unusual in a few ways beyond their abilities. An elemental tempest's physical appearance was likely the most immediately obvious difference, as a tempest's body constantly flickered between one element and another. For instance, an elemental tempest of fire and wind might have been covered in red flames across most of his body with an arm of chilly blue. This caused a constant strain on an elemental tempest's body, though such Genasi usually embraced the feeling, rather than seeing it as a burden.\n\nElemental tempests could also appear psychologically unstable. Because each manifestation had broad psychological traits associated with it, elemental tempests often appeared to have two warring personalities. However, in reality, a tempest was generally no more insane than the average Genasi in spite of frequent mood swings.{{Cite dragon/367/Ecology of the Genasi|16}}",
        "Abilities": "The most obvious ability of an elemental tempest was the one that defined themâ€“their ability to manifest two elements at once. These elements could be of any combination found amongst Genasi in which the tempest was already capable of manifesting. While manifesting these elements, which a tempest could change while resting, a tempest acquired the benefits of both manifestations simultaneously. On rare occasions an elemental tempest, when determined, could change one of their manifestations instantaneously or even temporarily adopt a manifestation they were normally incapable of using.\n\nNaturally, the ability to manifest two elements led into the rest of an elemental tempest's abilities. Each elemental tempest, for instance, charged the attacks they gained as tempests with elemental energy from each of the manifestations they were currently using, such as fire and cold. Experienced elemental tempests also gained an increased resistance to harm by [[:Category:Fire spells|elemental fire]], [[:Category:Cold spells|cold]], or [[:Category:Electricity spells|lightning]].\n\nAlthough it seemed natural that elemental tempests would draw upon [[elemental magic]], this was hardly necessary. Tempests could come from any background, from [[rogue]]s to [[paladin]]s, and the power that fueled their abilities may have come from any of several sources, be they [[arcane magic|arcane]], [[divine magic|divine]], or simply the result of tapping the Genasi's inner potential. Each of a Genasi's powers were unmistakably elemental in nature, however. For instance, ''[[absorb elements]]'' was an ability novice tempests were capable of that allowed an elemental tempest to absorb harmful elemental energy and charge their own attacks with it. ''[[Elemental fury]]'' similarly allowed tempests to blast their foes with elemental power."
