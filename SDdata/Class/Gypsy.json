        "mainbody": "'''Gypsy''' was a general term used to refer to itinerant people of a typically roguish nature, though the exact prevalence of [[rogue]]s among such people was possibly exaggerated. Such people might otherwise be referred to as '''forest nomads''' or in some places as '''tzigone'''.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"language\">In ''[[The Magehound]]'' it is said that the word tzigone meant \"...gypsy in some obscure northern tongue...\", but it is never specified what specific language the word came from. In the context of the novel, \"northern\" would mean anything north of the nation of [[Halruaa]].",
        "Culture": "People classified as \"gypsies\" lived rural, nomadic lives, traveling from place to place, sometimes in groups with [[horse]]-drawn carts and [[wagon]]s, Occasionally they settled in one place for an extended period of time and operated stores.{{Cite organized play/LC/Envy Life|9}} The life of a gypsy was usually had by [[human]]s,{{Cite dragon/59/Gypsies: A curse or a blessing|17}}{{Cite dragon/191/Open your Mind|18}} [[elves]],{{Cite organized play/LC/The Gift of Song|6}} Elves were generally well disposed to such people, especially [[wood elves]], as were most rogues, [[bard]]s, [[ranger]]s,\n\nAll gypsies lived by some form of rigid code of personal honor and laws. These were colored by the morality and values characteristic of each individual's alignment, that instilled among some outsiders a sense of distrust towards gypsies.\n\nThey generally did not have any societal hierarchies, although sometimes they would lay claim to the titles of \"King\" or \"Queen\" in order to gain advantage in bartering,\n\n[[File:MadameEva Fortune.jpg|thumb|273px|''There are many fortunes to be read by [[Madam Eva]] of the [[Zarovan]] Vistani.'']]\nMuch like bards, having gathered much knowledge and common sense during their journeys. This, coupled with a common proficiency in music, lead many such people to take up the life of a true bard. \n\nWhat gypsies were most well known for were their skills in fortune-telling or soothsaying, often charging a price for their services.<ref> They often utilized decks of cards in telling fortunes,{{Cite organized play/LC/An Average Day in Ravens Bluff|8}}{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2}} such as a [[tarokka]] deck, or crystal balls.<ref><ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Luck Takes a Vacation|7}}\n\nThere existed a great variety of gypsy groups across the wider Realms, as well as beyond [[Toril]] itself in the form of the [[aperusa]] of [[wildspace]], the [[w:c:greyhawk:Rhennee|Rhennee]] of [[Oerth]],{{Cite dragon/191/Open your Mind|17}} and in the [[Domains of Dread]], with the most notable group of Ravenloft being the [[Vistani]].\n\nThroughout [[Faerûn]]'s [[Western Heartlands]] there were the [[Gur]], a human ethnic group\n\nIn [[the Vast]], another region of northern Faerûn, was home to many people that identified as gypsies, especially in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite organized play/LC/The Rogue of the World|3-4}}{{Cite web/RPGA/Ravens Bluff Bard's Guild}}{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stars and Moon Above|2}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Alter Egos|8-9}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Cloaks and Daggers|13}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Monday's Child|11,14-15}} There anyone not a member of the city's [[Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists|bards guild]] had to pay for a temporary permit in order to perform, an exception was notably made for gypsy bards so long as they first paid their respects at the [[Guildhouse of the Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists|guildhouse]] after entering the city.{{Cite polyhedron/42/The Living City: The Crescent Moon|7}} Madame [[LaTachia]]; and [[Jadrian]], a jewelry merchant and member of the [[Knights of the Hawk]].",
        "Abilities": "Gypsies were often gifted in [[the Art]],{{Cite dragon/380/Playing Vistani|78}} Common spells included ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[object reading]]'', ''[[precognition]]'', and ''[[telepathy]]''. Fledgling mages, not yet skilled enough to use true forms of divination magic, might resort to learning spells that would allow them to fake seances, such as ''[[magic mouth]]'', ''[[ventriloquism]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'',{{Cite dragon/59/Gypsies: A curse or a blessing|18}} and ''[[audible glamer]]''.<ref>{{Cite dragon/59/Gypsies: A curse or a blessing|20}} In place of arcane magic, other gypsies cultivated a connection with nature and gained the use of druidic spells, such as ''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[locate animals or plants]]'', and ''[[speak with animals]]''. \n\nBeyond magic, it was quite common for gypsies to be [[psion]]s,{{Cite dragon/59/Gypsies: A curse or a blessing|18}}\n\nMany gypsies uniquely possessed an ability to lay [[curse]]s upon people,<ref>{{Cite dragon/59/Gypsies: A curse or a blessing|17,19-20}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Alter Egos|18,21}}<ref> with some being so powerful that only a [[deity]] or the gypsy themselves could undo a curse.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Alter Egos|18}} They also had an affinity for identifying or recognizing the presence of curses.",
        "Possessions": "Beyond innate abilities, gypsies often possessed or were skilled with [[magic item]]s that emulated divination spells and utilized them in their fortune-telling, This left them to choose such things as [[hide armor]], [[leather armor]], [[studded leather]], [[padded armor]], and sometimes even [[elven chainmail]], though others felt even the metalwork of elves couldn't be trusted when it came to stealth.\n\nAcross many realms it was commonly found that gypsies wore vibrant clothing. In the Vast for instance, gypsy women were well known for dressing in embroidered skirts that were brightly colored.",
        "Combat": "Rather than engaging in direct confrontations, gypsies preferred the rather roguish approach of stealth and trickery. They were typically quite skilled in fighting with [[dagger]]s and knives, though were also known to fight with such weapons as [[bow]]s, [[crossbow]]s, and one-handed swords like the [[khopesh]] and [[scimitar]]. They generally forewent two-handed weaponry, such as [[polearm]]s."
