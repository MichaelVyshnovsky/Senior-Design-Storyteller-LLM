        "mainbody": "'''Warmages''' were arcane spellcasters who lived for the din of combat, clashing blades, screams of pain, and, especially, the epic destruction wrought by war. The more utilitarian spells of [[wizard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[bard]]s had little importance to a warmage. They favored function over form and were drilled only in spells most useful for smiting foes, sowing confusion, and screening allies. A warmage cared only for success in battle, often as part of an army, or in the smaller series of campaigns favored by adventuring companies.{{cite book/Complete Arcane|10}}",

            "Warmage Adventurers": "For adventuring companies, a warmage provided one thing: brute firepower. Warmages honed their skills through action, not study, so without prolonged use of their powers they could become truly deadly. Good-hearted warmages were concerned with using their skills to thwart evil. In contrast, vile warmages had little to no constraint on their actions, and adventured solely to gain power.",
