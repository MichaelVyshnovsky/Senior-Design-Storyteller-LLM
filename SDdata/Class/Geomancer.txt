'''Geomancers''' were powerful [[wizard]]s or [[priest]]s in [[Zakhara]] who mastered the [[element of earth]]. They worshiped the god [[Grumbar]].{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|9-10}}<ref group="note">Geomancers could be be priests, wizards or even dual-classed in the [[Al-Qadim]] setting.

==Requirements==
Geomancer priests worshiped Grumbar, the Cold God of the Earth. They were particularly wicked individuals.

==Role==
Geomancers sought to understand and interpret [[Fate]] through their unique magic. Their higher understanding of Fate would allow them to command the entire world. Their unique combination of both [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic]] set them apart from other practitioners and allowed them to create powerful [[geoglyph]]s.

The empire of the Geomancers was controlled by the priests of Grumbar, though the supreme ruling council, known as the [[Nine Council]], was led by individuals who had mastered both arcane and divine magic.

Priests with exceptional intelligence were given further training, granting them access to additional powers detailed below.

==Benefits==
Because of their connection to Grumbar, Geomancers were highly resistant to magic from the earth element and they could command or turn creatures native to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. This included creatures more powerful than the typical [[earth elemental]] like [[dao]] and [[monolith]]s. Geomancers could quickly summon earth elementals to do their bidding. Like priests from other religions, they could also turn and command [[undead]].

==Hindrances==
Geomancers could not wear armor or use shields. Any weapon they wielded needed to be made of unrefined metal or stone.
