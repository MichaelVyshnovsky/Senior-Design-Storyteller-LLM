        "mainbody": "Highborns were specialty priests devoted to Siamorphe, the Divine Right.\nAll highborns were required to be human or half-elven descendants from long-established noble families, many of these hailing from Waterdeep. Highborns were also commonly from Cormyr and Tethyr. Given their close ties with the nobility, highborns were always dressed in the latest fashions within their homeland, and quickly got themselves up to date on the latest trends when visiting new cities or lands.\nMost highborns were skilled at riding horses.\nHighborns could speak a soothing word up to three times per day. This power could remove magical fear within everyone surrounding the highborn and also make them look upon the highborn in a more favorable light.\nThey had access to a variety of magical abilities that could be used on a daily basis including divine bloodline, command, augury, enthrall, unquestioning obedience, loyal vassal, divination, commune, and consequence. Additionally, they could cast guards and wards, Forests fiery constrictor, and legend lore three times per tenday.\nHighborns only wielded bludgeoning weapons. They preferred wearing chainmail, or even heavier, metallic armor. Many also carried a shield."
