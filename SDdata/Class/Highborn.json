        "mainbody": "'''Highborns''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Siamorphe]], the Divine Right.",
        "Culture": "All highborns were required to be [[human]] or [[half-elven]] descendants from long-established noble families, many of these hailing from [[Waterdeep]]. Highborns were also commonly from [[Cormyr]] and [[Tethyr]]. Given their close ties with the nobility, highborns were always dressed in the latest fashions within their homeland, and quickly got themselves up to date on the latest trends when visiting new cities or lands.",
        "Abilities": "Most highborns were skilled at riding [[horse]]s.\n\nHighborns could speak a ''[[soothing word]]'' up to three times per day. This power could remove magical ''[[fear]]'' within everyone surrounding the highborn and also make them look upon the highborn in a more favorable light.\n\nThey had access to a variety of magical abilities that could be used on a daily basis including ''[[divine bloodline]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[augury]]'', ''[[enthrall]]'', ''[[unquestioning obedience]]'', ''[[loyal vassal]]'', ''[[Divination (spell)|divination]]'', ''[[commune]]'', and ''[[consequence]]''. Additionally, they could cast ''[[guards and wards]]'', ''[[Forest's fiery constrictor]]'', and ''[[legend lore]]'' three times per tenday.",
        "Possessions": "Highborns only wielded bludgeoning weapons. They preferred wearing [[chainmail]], or even heavier, metallic [[armor]]. Many also carried a [[shield]]."
