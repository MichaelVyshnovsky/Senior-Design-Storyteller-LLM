Barakor were specialty priests devoted to Gorm Gulthyn, the Lord of the Bronze Mask.
The vast majority of barakor were shield dwarves or gold dwarves, but members of all of the dwarf races, both males and females, could become a barakor.
Barakor were skilled armorers or weaponsmiths. If serving as a guardian, a barakor was never surprised and could easily detect the approach of intruders, allowing them to accurately target them in the darkness with missile weapons. They required only half the normal amount of sleep in order to rest and heal from injuries. Their practice with weaponry allowed them to strike more often during combat, similar to a warrior.
In addition to their normal spells, barakor could cast sentry of Gorm, blessed watchfulness, iron vigil, sacred guardian, spike stones, shield, fire eyes, unceasing vigilance of the holy sentinel, and wall of stone on a daily basis. Additionally, they could cast know alignment at will and true seeing twice per day. They were immune to any magical or psionic attacks attempting to put them to sleep.
Barakor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the armor they were allowed to wear.
