'''Dumathoin''' ({{Pronounce|DOO|muh|THOE|in|refs=|primary stress=3}} {{Pronounce|doo|ma|THO|in|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}|alt=yes}}), was the patron of [[shield dwarves]], and the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[deity]] of mining and underground exploration and was known as the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain. He was also the protector of the dwarven dead. His [[holy symbol]] was a cut, faceted [[gem]] inside a mountain.

==Worshipers==
[[File:Symbol of Dumathoin.jpg|thumb|''Symbol of Dumathoin.'']]
Dumathoin's [[cleric|clerics]], known as the ''talhund'' ("hidden gifts"), protected mines from disrespectful profiteers as well as sought out new veins and gem deposits. They also supervised all mining activities to ensure that the proper respect was paid to the mountain and produced new stratagem and combat techniques for fighting the many [[Underdark]] creatures exhumed during excavation.

Dumathoin is said to have specially blessed the [[urdunnir]] dwarves, and provided them with the gems they need to live.
