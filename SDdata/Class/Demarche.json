        "Culture": "Demarches were typically regarded as the elite of the Church of Mask, often rising to the position of high priest.",
        "Abilities": "Most demarches were proficient in [[thief|thieving]] skills, and could communicate in [[thieves' cant]]. They were usually also skilled at the arts of disguise, forgery, and reading lips.\n\nThrough their devotion to Mask, demarches could gain access to Maskarran [[spell]]s like ''[[Shadowcloak (spell)|shadowcloak]]''. With time and training, they could also learn to cast various shadow-themed spells such as ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[Lorloveim's creeping shadow]]'', ''[[shadow door]]'', ''[[shadow monsters]]'', ''[[demi-shadow monsters]]'', ''[[shades]]'', ''[[Lorloveim's shadowy transformation]]'', ''[[shadowcat]]'', ''[[shadow walk]]'', and ''[[vanish]]''.\n\nUnlike regular [[cleric]]s of Mask, demarches could neither ''[[turn undead|turn]]'' nor ''[[command undead]]''.",
        "Possessions": "A demarche was typically outfitted in some form of [[leather armor]] and armed with either a bludgeoning weapon or a [[knife]], [[dagger]], or [[hand crossbow]].",
        "History": "Following Mask's loss of status in the divine hierarchy after the [[Time of Troubles]], the amount of specialty priests in the church increased significantly. This was because Mask felt demarches fulfilled a useful support role for thieves, who made up the bulk of his base of worshipers, and so he furiously encouraged the recruitment and advancement of specialty priests. As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, demarches made up roughly forty percent of the Church of Mask, with regular priests making up about thirty percent.'\n\nAs of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the term demarche (and demarchess) referred to any priest of Mask.",
        "Notable Demarchs": "* [[Hond Rhauballa]], Shadowlord Demarche of the [[House of Spires and Shadows]] in [[Westgate]].\n* [[Avnon Des]], First Demarche of the [[Hall of Shadows]], a temple of [[Mask]] in [[Elgrin Fau]], a city from another world that was trapped in the [[Shadowfell]]."
