Savras (
He was portrayed as a man with a crystalline face, clear to all who saw him. His statements were clear, concise, and rarely what the listener wished to hear. Savras symbol was a monstrous eye, or a crystal ball filled with eyes.
Savras main duty was to monitor the casting of Epic Magic, and curb its usage amidst non-mortals & extraplanars, especially when this was done heedlessly.
Savras, along with Velsharoon, served Azuth, who was his superior, and thus served Mystra indirectly. He resented his service to Azuth, but the two were steadily, if cautiously, establishing a formal division of portfolios and responsibilities, and a more amiable relationship.

Savras was worshiped in both the north and south as a god of diviners and truth-speakers. His clergy was still sparse in the late 14 century DR, as Savras had just been released from his centuries-old prison. Savrass only famous servant was Alaundo of Candlekeep, the one true prophet of the Realms.
Savras was particularly beloved in the nations of the Chultan Peninsula (Tashalar, Samarach, Nimbral, and so on, where scrying and spying were practically the national pastimes because the inhabitants fear of the yuan-ti.
The Gurs were known to worship Savras, which may explain the survival of his faith during his long period of imprisonment.
The most devout worshipers of Savras carried around elaborate staves with them at all times. This was in the hope that their god might make their staff his temporary residence.
Benign Order of the Third Eye
 A secret cult would seem to be anathema for a god devoted to finding the truth, but in 1371 DR such a cult did form. Consisting mainly of archivists (and incidentally containing the highest concentration of archivists of any group in the Realms) the Benign Order of the Third Eyes members were all granted a vision from Savras where he impressed upon them the need to collect magic and lore in preparation for an upcoming battle with Cyric. Unfortunately, the Order was overzealous in its search and became known for graverobbing.
Once Savras was a mortal wizard of Halruaa.
Savras, a demigod, and Azuth, a wizard with god-like abilities, once dueled when Azuth contended for Savrass place in the . Savras fell, with Azuth becoming the one god of wizards.
Savras was imprisoned in the Scepter of Savras by Azuth, where he remained until the Time of Troubles in the . Following this, Azuth agreed to release Savras in exchange for a pledge of fealty.
But in the , Cyric entered Dweomerheart with Shars aid and there murdered Mystra. The plane broke apart, hurling Azuth and Velsharoon deep into the Astral Plane and killing Savras outright.
Yet he got better, returning to godhood by the 1480s DR. By 1490 DR, priests were still actively worshiping Savras in temples across Chult.
