        "mainbody": "Eachthighern (Pronounce|ek|tee|arn|refs=The in-universe language for this translation is not given in the source however, it is an approximate translation from real-world Gaelic, where each is \"horse\" and thigherna is \"lord\". The name Echthighern, also meaning \"horse lord\" was the name of an historic prince of Ireland. In the Forgotten Realms, this would most likely place it in one of the Waelan languages, such as Druidic.\nEachthigherns avatar was a powerfully strong and majestic, white-haired winged unicorn or horned pegasus. He had gray spots on his underbelly and gray fringes in his beard and mane.\nEachthighern was proud, loyal, and faithful—so much so that his name symbolized loyalty and bravery to the fey peoples. He sometimes allowed noble beings to ride him.\nEachtigherns kicks could magically paralyze foes, and his horn was as effective as a powerfully enchanted blade. His avatar shared a number of innate magical powers in common with the other sylvan gods. He was also immune to all enchantments and charms and to paralyzation. Only powerful magical weapons could harm him.\nMultiple times per day, his avatar had the power to cure serious wounds, to remove diseases, and to slow and neutralize poisons. Daily, he could cure critical wounds, restore health, and fully heal. Those who touched his horn were immediately cured of light wounds.\nOnce every tenday or so, he could muster the power to speak a holy word that could incapacitate or slay evil enemies, forbid them from planar travel, or banish them from his plane.\nEachthighern shared the divine realm of the Inner Circle of the Seelie Court, which had no permanent location but instead wandered from plane to plane, from the Beastlands to Arborea to Ysgard.\nEachtighern was a protector and defender of sylvan realms, often seen flying overhead in the Beastlands or around Mount Olympus, serving as guardian of forest glades and stone circles and other sites holy to fey.\nAt rare times, he might send an avatar to bring healing to faerie folk or elves in dire need from defending their homes from evil.\nSeveral legends were presented for Eachthigherns origin. Some said that he was a created as a gift from an unknown sky-god to the faerie folk. Others said that he was the son of Erevan Ilesere or another trickster god, who changed form into a female as a joke to bear him. The most common myth was that he was the son of Koriel, the god of ki-rins.\nSome religious myths held that Eachthighern was the father of Lurue of the Faerûnian pantheon) and of Yathaghera, the demigoddess of Evermeets pegasi. Others claimed that it was Kamerynn, the unicorn of the Moonshaes, who was Lurues father, but as was noted above, some scholars, especially of other worlds than Toril, believed Kamerynn to simply be an avatar of Eachthighern. For her part, Lurue denied this connection.\nThe elves of Evermeet believed that all of the unicorns of their island were direct descendants of the Lord of Unicorns.\nEachthighern was considered a member of the Inner Circle of the Seelie Court, serving Titania and Oberon along with Damh and Verenestra, their children, and with Sqeulaiche, the leprechaun god.\nEachthighern was known to have allowed both Oberon and Fionnghuala, demigoddess of the swanmays, to ride him, but typically Fionnghuala flew on her own beside him while Oberon rode his own flying steed. Another deity said to have ridden Eachthighern was Hanali Celanil of the Seldarine.\nEachtighern, like other sylvan gods, did not grant spells to his followers, nor did he have priests or clerics, for all fey creatures had magical powers of their own. Nevertheless, he was revered primarily by unicorns and secondarily by pegasi as a god of healing, loyalty, and protection.\nHe was not directly worshiped most places in the Realms however, Kamerynn, a unicorn summoned by the Earthmother of the Moonshae Isles may have been one of his avatars.\nOne place on Toril where Eachtighern was worshiped was Evermeet, where the herds of unicorns and pegasi there revered him, and it was said that he would come to the defense of the elves island if the unicorns and pegasi there were ever attacked by outside forces."
