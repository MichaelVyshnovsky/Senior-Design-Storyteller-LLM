'''Halruaan magehounds''' were the inquisitors of [[Halruaa]] who enforced its paramount [[magic]] laws and regulated the use of magic therein. They answered only to the [[Council of Elders (Halruaa)|Council of Elders]].

{{quote|''Justice? Is that what you think happens around here? I know the magehound who works the hold. He's an ugly little [[monkey]] of a man who holds a grudge against anyone better favored than he. One look at that handsome face of yours and he'll be howling for an Inquisition. If I were you, I wouldn't bet my future on the outcome.''|[[Tzigone]] of [[Khaerbaal]]}}

==Culture==
Magehounds were responsible for some of the most important tasks involved in the regulation of Halruaan magic laws. Among these were testing the [[Jordaini]] caste for magical abilities, and hunting down renegade or criminal magic users.

No [[wizard]]s were beyond their authority or reach, including the Council who oversaw their actions. Because of this authority, magehounds lived a solitary and lonely lifestyle, being feared and shunned by their arcane brethren. Despite this, magehounds would keep some associates with complimentary skills to assist in their hunts.

==Abilities==
Magehounds honed their skills to attain ''[[Arcane sensitivity|increased sensitivity]]'' towards [[arcane magic]] and protect themselves from its effects.

The most powerful from among their ranks were capable of developing ''[[antimagic field]]s'', in order to help them contain rogue [[spellcaster]]s.
