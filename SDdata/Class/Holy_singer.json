        "mainbody": "Holy singers were specialty priests of the Church of Oghma who specialized in arbitration and peacekeeping activities through song, hoping the harmony in their voices brought harmony to those around them.\nA holy singer would usually choose to sing rather than speak.\nAll holy singers were either humans, elves, or half-elves. They were quite humble, though they sometimes appeared to be arrogant to others. Still, a holy singers reputation often preceded them in a positive way.\nHoly singers used their voice to turn undead through song. Likewise, they could sing to create a protection from evil, 10 radius sphere as well. A holy singer could forgo the need for a somatic component by singing, but this did increase the casting time by a small amount.\nAny attack, magical or otherwise, against a holy singers voice or ability to speak often left them confused.\nThe attire of a holy singer was a white tunic and pants and a black gold-trimmed vest. They also wore a crimson hat complete with a feather."
