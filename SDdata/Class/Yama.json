        "mainbody": "'''Yama''' was one of the [[Lords of Creation]], who watched over the lands of [[Malatra]]. Within his pantheon, he was the god of death.",
        "Description": "Yama most typically appeared with green skin and [[copper]] eyes. He dressed in red robes.",
        "Abilities": "Yama was supremely intelligent and had mastery of all spells that caused damage to his enemies, particularly those of the school of [[necromancy]]. He had the ability to see the deeds of any soul's entire life in simply a passing look.",
        "Possessions": "Yama's red robes had many powers, including [[Magic resistance|resistance to all magic]] and immunity to damage from heat, light, cold, and electricity. They granted him the power to fly through both air and water. They also flashed in warning before any surprise attack.\n\nYama wore ''[[armor of etherealness]]'' and carried three weapons, a dagger that brought instant death, a red [[mace]], and a magical noose that strangled those whom he caught with it.",
        "Divine Realm": "While Yama usually wandered the planes, his [[divine realm]] was a palace called [[Yamasadena]]",
        "Activities": "It was Yama's role to decide where those who worshiped his pantheon went in the [[afterlife]], based on a record of their deeds in life. When souls died, they had to pass through the Vaitarani to reach his realm, and they were always covered in an amount of blood symbolic of their karmic debt. Yama decided what form a soul should take upon [[Reincarnate|reincarnation]]. Typically, souls remained in his realm for a relatively short time before being sent back to the [[Material Plane]] to be reincarnated, although others were sent instead to be judged by Varuna. Still others first had to travel through 21 different periods of torment before returning to life. Yama paid no heed to the prayers of mortals in making his judgments, though he might be persuaded by another deity's opinion. Those who had freed themselves of the binds of [[karma]] were not Yama's to judge, having become one with [[Brahman]].\n\nYama also invented weapons for other powers, but only for the Lords of Creation. He had little contact with gods and goddesses from other pantheons.\n\nHis role as judge of the dead left him little time to concern himself with the matters of the living. When a mortal was close to death, Yama might send a vision of an [[owl]], a [[pigeon]], or a four-eyed [[dog]].",
        "Relationships": "Yama was one of the many children of [[Aditi]] and had many brothers and sisters: [[Mitra]], [[Puchan]], [[Rudra]], [[Savitri]], [[Surya]], [[Tvashtri]], [[Varuna]], and [[Vishnu]].",
        "Worshipers": "[[File:Yama holy symbol.png|thumb|right|''The [[holy symbol]] of Yama.'']]\nYama and the rest of the Lords of Creation were worshiped in the Malatra region, especially in the [[Kuong Kingdom]]. The hill tribes of the area, who usually worshiped nature spirits instead of the Lords of Creation, sometimes did worship both Yama and his water buffalo. His [[priest]]s were responsible for preparing dead bodies for cremation, and if they tarried too long before cremating someone they might even lose their [[Divine magic|divine spell powers]].\n\nYama was represented by the [[holy symbol]] of a red mace.",
        "History": "Yama was said to have been the first mortal to die, promoted to godhood by the powers because of his ability to cause destruction.\n\nAfter the footsteps of Indra's [[elephant]] shaped the valleys and hills of the land of Malatra, Yama claimed the land as his own. Indra was furious, but she could not take the land back from him. Yama then created the animals and ancient [[human]]s of near [[demigod]]-power who populated his land."
