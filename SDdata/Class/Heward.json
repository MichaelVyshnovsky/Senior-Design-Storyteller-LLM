        "mainbody": "Heward was a hero-god of Oerth that served as a patron of bards. He was one of the Company of Seven, a band of variously divine former adventurers who were credited with the creation of many magical items found on many worlds.\nHewards mythological origins held that he was the first human to learn the art of music from the elves, and that he passed this knowledge onto the first bards with the help of his Mystical Organ. His mastery of the craft drove a number of deities to jealousy, and these powers—thought by some to have been the Seldarine, not wanting the elven musical tradition to end up overshadowed—influenced the mice of Hewards hall to sabotage the bards famous instrument. As they were pressed, the discordant keys of the ruined organ were said to be where harpies and sirens first got their magical songs. In an act of revenge against the mice, Heward cursed them to become lowly creatures with a final composition.\nA number of sages thought that Hewards divinity was attained by becoming an exarch in the service of Ioun, a power observed in some spheres as the original creator of the ioun stones.\nA number of magic items were attributed to Heward, including\n*Hewards handy haversack\n*Hewards handy spice pouch\n*Hewards Mystical Organ\n*Hewards bell\n*Hewards fortifying bedroll\n*Hewards hireling armor\n*Hewards lyre of truth\nHeward also composed a number of musical arrangements with his Mystical Organ, including the magically potent but potentially disastrous Hewards Mistake,"
