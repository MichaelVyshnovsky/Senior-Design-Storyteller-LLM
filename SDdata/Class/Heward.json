He was one of the [[Company of Seven]], a band of variously divine former adventurers who were credited with the creation of many magical items found on many worlds.{{Cite dragon/359/Treasures of Greyhawk: Magic of the Company of Seven|70-71}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Heward's mythological origins held that he was the first [[human]] to learn the art of music from the [[elf|elves]], and that he passed this knowledge onto the first bards with the help of his ''[[Heward's Mystical Organ|Mystical Organ]]''. His mastery of the craft drove a number of deities to jealousy, and these powers—thought by some to have been the [[Seldarine]], not wanting the elven musical tradition to end up overshadowed—influenced the [[mouse|mice]] of Heward's hall to sabotage the bard's famous instrument. As they were pressed, the discordant keys of the ruined organ were said to be where [[harpy|harpies]] and [[siren]]s first got their magical songs. In an act of revenge against the mice, Heward cursed them to become lowly creatures with a final composition.\n\nA number of sages thought that Heward's divinity was attained by becoming an [[exarch]] in the service of Ioun, a power observed in some spheres as the original creator of the [[ioun stone]]s.{{Cite dungeon/205/Stocking the Shelves|3}}",
        "Creations": "A number of magic items were attributed to Heward, including:\n*''[[Heward's handy haversack]]''\n*''[[Heward's handy spice pouch]]''\n*''[[Heward's Mystical Organ]]''\n*''Heward's bell''\n*''Heward's fortifying bedroll''\n*''Heward's hireling armor''\n*''Heward's lyre of truth''{{Cite dragon/359/Treasures of Greyhawk: Magic of the Company of Seven|71-72}}\n\nHeward also composed a number of musical arrangements with his ''Mystical Organ'', including the magically potent but potentially disastrous ''Heward's Mistake'',"
