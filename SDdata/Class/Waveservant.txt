'''Waveservants''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen. 

==Culture==
These specialty priests were both male and female and primarily [[human]]s.

They served as enforcers and tribute gatherers of the Bitch Queen. They were typically solitary individuals, with some living on stormy islands and coastlines, while others spent their entire lives on ships. Many earned their livelihood as pirates, targeting merchant ships that failed to offer adequate tribute to their goddess. They seldom strayed far from large bodies of water.

==Abilities==
In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, waveservants could cast ''[[watery double]]'', ''[[striking wave]]'', and ''[[control weather]]'' on a daily basis. They could ''[[water walk]]'' and breathe while under water at will. They were also able to move through water as if wearing a ''[[ring of free action]]''. If located in an appropriate area, waveservants could summon up to four [[shark]] servants per day. A waveservant could not [[turn undead|turn]] or [[command undead]] unless the [[undead]] died while at sea or were "natural" aquatic forms of undead such as [[lacedon]]s.

==Possessions==
In addition to bludgeoning weapons, waveservants often wielded [[trident]]s, [[harpoon]]s, and a special dueling [[knife]]. The heaviest [[armor]] they wore was [[leather armor]] and some carried a [[shield]].
