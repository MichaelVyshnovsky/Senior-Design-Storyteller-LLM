        "mainbody": "'''Feywardens''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Corellon Larethian]], the Creator of the Elves.",
        "Culture": "All feywardens were [[elves]] or [[half-elves]], with the vast majority being [[moon elves]] or [[gold elves]]. They were highly regarded among elves. A [[drow]] could not become a feywarden.",
        "Abilities": "Feywardens were completely immune to the paralyzing touch of [[ghoul]]s and [[ghast]]s, and resistant to similar touch attacks from other [[undead]] such as [[lich]]s. They were also immune to all ''[[Hold person|hold]]'' [[spell]]s and resistant to [[spider]] venom.\n\nIn addition to their normal [[spell]]s, feywardens could cast ''[[sixth sense]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[idea]]'', ''[[strength]]'' (including a variant that enhanced their dexterity), ''[[abjure]]'', ''[[minor creation]]'', ''[[enchanted weapon]]'', ''[[major creation]]'', ''[[banishment]]'', ''[[prismatic spray]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', and ''[[sunray]]'' once per day. [[Goblinoid]]s found it particularly difficult to resist spells cast by a feywarden.",
        "Possessions": "Feywardens did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield, nor the [[armor]] they could wear. All were skilled in the use of the [[longsword]] and [[longbow]]."
