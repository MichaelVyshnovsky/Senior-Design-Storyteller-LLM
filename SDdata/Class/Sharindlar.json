Although dwarves did not hide their worship of her, they called her the '''Lady of Mercy''' among non-dwarves to hide another aspect of her identity. Much more important to modern dwarves than her healing role was the status of the '''Lady of Life''' as their patron of romantic love, courtship, and most of all, fertility.",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Sharindlar was also known to manifest her favor through the discovery of [[emerald]]s, [[moonstone]]s, or round, [[silver]] coins, and indicated her displeasure by the appearance of curdled [[milk]], shattered [[egg]] shells, and worn, single boots (as opposed to a pair)."
        },
        "Personality": "Sharindlar was an invariably warm and caring goddess; she was naturally humble and unassuming, and always had a kind word for everyone, whether mortal or divine. She was known to look favorable upon both dwarves and non-dwarves, including pack animals and even monsters. The Shining Dancer was also spontaneously exuberant, given to shouts of joy, bursts of wild laughter, and impromptu dancing. \n\nAlthough she played a diplomatic peacekeeping role, she generally found politics dull and stuffy, preferring instead to speculate on the future love lives of both mortals and gods. The Lady of Life was a true romantic and habitual matchmaker who did her best to bring together star-crossed lovers no matter how astronomically low the odds.",
        "Powers": {
            "Manifestations": "Sharindlar was known to manifest to dwarves in need as a rosy or amber aura of radiance and warmth. The radiance was bright enough to read by and warm enough to allow for comfort in extremely cold areas."
        },
        "Possessions": "Sharindlar fought with a ''+6'', [[chaotic good]]-aligned [[whip]] studded with [[adamantine]] barbs. She also wielded a ''+2'' [[mace]] that always struck silently, and which forced [[ethereal]] and invisible creatures into full and clear view on the [[Prime Material Plane]] for at least two minutes on contact.",
        "Realm": "Sharindlar's realm was located in [[Nidavellir]] (the third layer of [[Ysgard]]) in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] and on a foothill near the primary mountain of [[Dwarfhome]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]]. The [[Merciful Court]], as it was known, was a circle of standing stones from which Sharindlar served as an intermediary between [[Moradin]] and the evil dwarven gods, including [[Abbathor]], [[Laduguer]], and [[Deep Duerra]]. It also served as the site of nightly dances in her honor.",
        "Activities": "Despite her known party visits, Sharindlar rarely appeared as an avatar, instead often helping dwarves in her radiant manifestation. A sick dwarf might be guided to shelter or water, while a dwarf searching for healing herbs or plant antidotes that they needed and that existed nearby would be marked by the radiance, guiding the searcher to it. The radiance might appear to dwarves that were cold and without shelter, keeping them comfortable even as they rested on glaciers or in rock ledges during blizzards.\n\nDuring dances, moots, and any over gatherings where a dwarven relationship might start, Sharindlar often tried to sway the thoughts and deeds of dwarves through her radiance. It was debated among dwarven scholars if those in her presence were simply following what they believed to be a hint and a sign of approval, or if the radiance could manifest a subtle aphrodisiac power. In any case, more than one dwarven maiden or bachelor favored by the Lady of Life had been swept into a series of dalliances as a result of her ceaseless attempts to find them the perfect mate.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Sharindlar_symbol.jpg|Symbol of Sharindlar|thumb|right|250px|Sharindlar's holy symbol.]]\nSharindlar was one of the older dwarven gods, and had always been in good standing within the [[Morndinsamman]]. She had established excellent relations with her peers over the millenia, as she had little tolerance for disputes or rivalries that interfered with her bringing of healing to the wounded and mercy to the distressed.\n\nAlthough she abhorred their principles and they weren't exactly allies, she had managed to forge working relationships with even [[Abbathor]] and the [[duergar]] gods, ranging from toleration to strained friendship. She was also one of the few dwarven gods to interact with the estranged [[Thard Harr]] on a somewhat frequent basis, in her case due to her interest in the rampant fertility of the jungle. As a result of this, Sharindlar served [[Moradin]] on several occasions as his ambassador, an intermediary between him and those he had cast away (such as Laduguer) in the rare cases when they were forced to communicate, such as if a disaster forced usually antagonistic dwarves to cooperate.\n\nA closer relationship could be seen between Sharindlar and [[Berronar]], Moradin's wife and the dwarf goddess of love and marriage. The two worked hand-in-hand in inspiring acts of love among dwarves, fulfilling notably different but complimentary roles. While Sharindlar oversaw courtship and romance, bringing dwarves together into relationships, Berronar guided dwarves into the lasting bonds of marriage and ensured that the relationship stayed healthy and strong. As her own doctrine would put it, Sharindlar restored the seed of dwarven life while Berronar protected the fruit.\n\nSharindlar had various other allies outside of her own pantheon. From the [[Seldarine]], she was close with [[Hanali Celanil]], [[elven]] goddess of love, and the triune goddess [[Angharradh]], the combined aspects of Hanali, [[Aerdrie]], and [[Sehanine]]. From the halfling pantheon, she had good relations with its matriarch [[Yondalla]], as well as [[Sheela Peryroyl]], goddess of dance, romance and agriculture, and [[Cyrrollalee]], goddess of friendship and hospitality. Other allies included the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerunian gods]] [[Chauntea]] (goddess of life and bounty), [[Eldath]] (goddess of peace and calm waters), [[Hathor]], ([[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandian]] goddess of love and dance) and [[Ilmater]] (god of martyrdom and perseverance). Aside from gods, she had good relations with some of the [[animal lord]]s of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].\n\nThe Shining Dancer also shared a great kinship with [[Shiallia]], the Dancer in the Glades and goddess of agriculture and new couples. It was believed by many that Shiallia was actually Sharindlar's daughter, the product of one of the Lady of Life's brief dalliances with a [[fey]] deity said in some myths to be [[Tapann]], god of the [[korred]]s.\n\nThere was only one being that could be truly called Sharindlar's enemy: [[Urdlen]], the [[gnome pantheon|gnome god]] of greed and hate. and harbored a deep hatred for everyone and everything.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Sharindlar's followers were called to be merciful in both speech and deed, bringing healing and relief to those in need. Their traditional duties, which they spent most of their time on, were ministering to the sick or frail members of dwarf communities, although they dispensed their aid to other individuals that required it. To act in this capacity, they worked both in hospices within dwarven strongholds, and traveled to remote holds throughout the wilderness, whether on the surface or subterranean. They were to use constructive efforts of charity to allay aggression and hostility, and provided words of encouragement to the unwell with gentle bedside manner. \n\nWhen not engaged in their primary responsibility, the devoted of Sharindlar instead worked to instruct dwarven youths on proper courting rituals The traditional rites of courting and marriage were to be maintained, encouraged, and taught by the faithful, and these included traditional dances, ritual forms of address, and similar customs. They strove to bring young dwarves together, especially those outside of traditional clans in the hopes of an increase in prolific unions, and in some cases went as far as playing matchmaker between two youths they deemed \"compatible\".\n\nAccording to Sharindlar's doctrine, it was necessary for the dwarves to live in safety so that they could propagate, and the church overall sought to increase the health and numbers of the dwarven population throughout all of the Realms. The slow decline of dwarven birthrates, particularly among the shield dwarves of the [[North Faerun|North]], saw them spending most of their time working in concert with Berronar's clergy (as they were encouraged to do) to reverse the trend. Given their concern with birth, both literal and metaphorical, most treated the [[Thunder Blessing]] with even greater reverence than ordinary dwarves, often going out of their way to encourage thunder twins to join the faith.\n\nIn regards to their personal lives, Sharindlar's followers were to treat life as an endless gift and dance, to be embraced and celebrated with joyful exuberance by living it to the fullest.",
            "Rituals": "Sharindlar's clerics normally prayed for their spells in the morning. Conversely, Sharindlar was often associated with the moon, and her holy days (aside from being on [[Greengrass]] and [[Midsummer Night]]) took place the night after the new moon and the night of the full moon. It was at this time when most of the more secret rituals of Sharindlar were enacted, commonly involving secret congregations performing them in hidden caverns with natural pools of water.\n\nDuring these rituals, the faithful cast golden items into a sanctified cauldron, which was heated until the gold was molten. This was mixed together with blood let by the worshipers from their forearms. Throughout the ritual, Sharindlar's name was chanted and the followers prayed for her mercy and guidance, dancing in a frenzy while keeping armor and weapons near at hand but not worn or carried. The contents of the cauldron were then poured into the pool of water, which In the [[Deep Kingdom]] of the gold dwarves was the [[Lake of Gold]], the rocky bottom of which was streaked with gleaming gold veins and covered with sparkling gold dust from the ages of worship.\n\nSuch rituals were mostly attempts to raise the low fertility rate of the dwarves, and the faithful were forbidden from removing gold from the lake. Couples (married or not) were also known to ask for Sharindlar's blessing in a similar way, entwining their arms and letting their blood flow together over melting, golden [[brazier]]s. All rituals of Sharindlar's fertility aspect celebrated in the Deep Realm always ended in great feasts and underway courting chases.\n\nRituals invoking the healing power of Sharindlar performed by two or more of her priests or priestesses had them gathering over the sick or injured. They would sprinkle the ill with a drop of their own freshly-let blood, usually drops from their palms, and a vial of water from the Lake of Gold while whispering secret names and descriptions of the goddess. Even Sharindlar's name, when whispered or silently repeated in the minds of those who had faith in her (even if they were members of a different faith) had a calming effect on upset dwarves and allowed those wracked with pain to sleep.\n\nThe healing ritual succeeded 20% of the time per each priest taking part, another 20% if the injured was favored, and 10% if Lake of Gold water was used. It amplified the healing process by making restorative spells take the maximal possible effect, doubling the rate at which rest helped the body, stopped the progress of poisons, diseases, and parasites (including [[rot grub]]s) for 2-5 days, and could have other beneficial effects depending on the circumstances.",
            "Temples": "Temples to Sharindlar were most often great halls free of pillars or other pieces of architecture, providing ample space for dancing and celebration. They were well-lit, often above ground or partially open to the sky, typically had fountains, pools, and formal gardens, and served as both chancels and grand ballrooms. Most had many small and intimate guest rooms for visiting revelers. They also normally had a small runestone library, which housed inscribed dwarven genealogies, clan records, courting rituals, formal dance descriptions, astronomy charts, medicinal practices, herbal brews, agricultural and animal husbandry records, and other similar documentation.\n\nOne of the most notable temples was located in the [[Sumber Hills]], hidden in the [[Vale of Dancing Waters]]. This temple was known as the [[Shrine of the Tender Oath]], and it was one of the few immaculate constructions remaining of the dwarven kingdom of [[Besilmer]]. In around [[1491 DR]], during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis, the temple was invaded by treasure hunters who hoped to dig into the ruins of [[Torhild Flametongue]]'s summer palace.",
            "Clothing": "Sharindlar's followers wore red robes with blue girdles for ceremony, leaving the head bare except for a [[robin]]'s egg blue [[scarf]]. A blue scarf was also tied around the brow, upper arm, wrist, or ankle as adornment. Although they avoided violence when possible, they were willing to protect both themselves and their charges from violent and clearly hostile opposition, girding themselves with armor when needed even if they preferred their normal clothing.\n\nThough rarely made apparent, followers of the Lady of Mercy normally carried small knives with which to end the suffering creatures about to die whose pain could not otherwise be alleviated. The holy symbol of the faith, a silver disk embossed on both sides with Sharindlar's sign, was often hung from a silvery [[chain]] around the neck."
        },
        "History": "Sharindlar was the patron deity of the Adamant Kingdom of [[Xothaerin]], a subkingdom of Deep Shanatar founded by one of the eight sons of Taark Shanat. It was once home to some of the greatest scholars of the dwarves and had strong ties to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], including a portal to the kingdom of the [[azer]], resulting in some level of interbreeding between them and the shield dwarves. The Xothaerin scepter, marked by Shainrldar's flaming needle symbol, laid in a lonely mountain cavern high within the [[Storm Horns]]. The mouth of the cave overlooked the [[Farsea Marshes]], yet no wind or predators would enter the cold cave, and the scepter was clutched close to the chest of a dwarf skeleton."
