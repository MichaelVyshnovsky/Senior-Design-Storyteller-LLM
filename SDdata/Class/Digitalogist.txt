Digitalogists were considered by many to be the most studious of all wizards. Other wizards viewed them with admiration since only a digitalogist was able to expertly break-down a spell into its functional components in order to make it perform at a higher level of efficiency.
A digitalogist could use the same weapons that regular wizards used. They never wore armor.
These wizards possessed a greater analytical understanding of magic compared to normal wizards. Because of this they were able to cast powerful spells that they would otherwise not have access to until much later.
Digitalogists were precise in their magical administrations. Because of this it took them longer to cast spells and longer to learn new spells. They could only use a magical scroll that was created by another digitalogist.
As with sorcerers, digitalogists chose two elemental provinces in which to specialize and they could not cast magical spells related to the other two elemental provinces.
