Traders were Azuposi rogues who earned a living traveling and trading wares with other communities.
They spent their time traveling between the many different settlements of the Azuposi.
Traders were wealthy by Azuposi standards. This earned them both a degree of respect and a fair share of envious glares.
They were skilled bargainers and generally got along well with others.
Traders dressed like most Azuposi, save for random accessories they accumulated during their far travels. A trader would usually dress appropriately for each village they visited, proving to the natives that they had been there before. They wielded clubs, slings, daggers, or short bows.
