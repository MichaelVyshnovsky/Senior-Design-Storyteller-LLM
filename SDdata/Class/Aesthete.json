        "mainbody": "esthetes were specialty priests of the Church of Sune who promoted physical beauty through the healing of scars and disfiguring injuries.\nThey tended to categorize unattractive people based upon whether their condition was a result of how they were born, an injury, or just poor grooming habits. Aesthetes openly ridiculed those with poor grooming habits, but helped bolster the inner beauty of those born with uncurable birth defects and did everything in their power to heal those with disfiguring wounds.\nThough aesthetes could be male or female, they were always stunning physical specimens. Those with red hair were especially favored by Sune.\nAn aesthetes healing magic excelled at healing without leaving a scar. Any protection spell cast by them lasted for twice as long as normal. They could use a special regenerate ability to allow others to heal from terrible wounds. This ability could be used once per week.\nTheir martial skills were lacking, preventing them from ever learning how to proficiently wield more than one weapon. Their worry about protecting their faces during combat sometimes left them attacking and defending themselves in a more clumsy manner.\nAesthetes wore fine clothing that was often very revealing. They all had a red velvet cloak when modesty was needed or to wear during inclement weather."
