        "mainbody": "ivine arbiters were specialty priests devoted to Osiris, the Lord of the Dead within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThey possessed extensive knowledge of the laws and legal customs of Mulhorand and used that knowledge to aid with resolving disputes. Their equally impressive knowledge of necrology and the netherworld aided them in finding lairs of the undead and in using their weaknesses to their advantage if confronted. They could raise the dead, but only if they were convinced that their death was contrary to the law or maat.\nDivine arbiters were always humans of Mulhorandi heritage.\nGiven their close association with the netherworld, divine arbiters excelled at turning undead. They had access to arcane magic from the school of necromancy and were more resistant against death spells, eventually becoming completely immune to any energy-draining attacks from undead. They could cast spiritual hammer, which they referred to as \"flail of deadly justice\", once per day. Their animate dead spell was twice as effective as normal, though they only used this spell in defense of tombs or sacred sites. They could speak with the dead with any target regardless of how long ago they died provided they had the deceaseds skull. Particularly powerful divine arbiters did not suffer any ill effects from casting resurrection or raise dead and those spells always succeeded.\nDivine arbiters wielded flails, warhammers, maces, staves, staff slings, or slings. They did not have any restrictions on the type of armor they could wear."
