        "mainbody": "'''Divine arbiters''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Osiris]], the Lord of the Dead within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].",
        "Activities": "They possessed extensive knowledge of the laws and legal customs of [[Mulhorand]] and used that knowledge to aid with resolving disputes. Their equally impressive knowledge of [[necrology]] and the [[netherworld knowledge|netherworld]] aided them in finding lairs of the [[undead]] and in using their weaknesses to their advantage if confronted. They could [[raise dead|raise the dead]], but only if they were convinced that their death was contrary to the law or maat.",
        "Culture": "Divine arbiters were always [[human]]s of [[Mulhorandi]] heritage.",
        "Abilities": "Given their close association with the netherworld, divine arbiters excelled at [[turning undead]]. They had access to [[arcane magic]] from the school of [[necromancy]] and were more resistant against death spells, eventually becoming completely immune to any energy-draining attacks from undead. They could cast ''[[spiritual hammer]]'', which they referred to as \"flail of deadly justice\", once per day. Their ''[[animate dead]]'' spell was twice as effective as normal, though they only used this spell in defense of tombs or sacred sites. They could [[speak with dead|speak with the dead]] with any target regardless of how long ago they died provided they had the deceased's skull. Particularly powerful divine arbiters did not suffer any ill effects from casting ''[[resurrection]]'' or ''raise dead'' and those spells always succeeded.",
        "Possessions": "Divine arbiters wielded [[flail]]s, [[warhammer]]s, [[mace]]s, [[staves]], [[staff sling]]s, or [[sling]]s. They did not have any restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they could wear."
