Additionally, she was self-absorbed, sadistic, and just generally mercurial, flitting about like a lit flame between her various obsessions.\n\n{{quote|Fly my pretties, fly!

        "Realm": {
            "Abriymoch": "The seat of Fierna and Belial's power was the stronghold known as Abriymoch, the primary, if not only, city in Phlegethos. It was built in the caldera of the largest volcano in the realm, a hollowed out mount still overrun with molten rock. The buildings inside were constructed of jagged obsidian, igneous rock, dark glass, basalt and other crystals and the lips of the crater were crowned with towers. The fortress was composed of a series of chambers stacked on top of one another that opened into the volcano's hole through balcony-like structures and were connected to each other by stairs, shafts and a grand central spiral that snaked around the inner edges. Some rooms stretched throughout the inside of the volcano's sloping structure and had windows and other exits that opened to its outer walls, which were constantly poured over by lava rivers.\n\nThe city's actual streets were so flooded with lava that foot travel was impossible, forcing visitors to pay for one of the dented, [[green-steel]] gondola manned by hundreds of spinagons and barbazus to ferry them to their destinations. Green-steel, in fact, was a primary export of Abriymoch, the valuable ore being derived from Phlegethos's magma which made it a primary weapons and armor trade center in Hell. Relatedly, Abriymoch was the strongest citadel in the middle hells, with black towers that kept innumerable [[merregon]]s and elite [[osyluth]]s and [[malebranche]]s. Hell hounds were also famous stays of Abriymoch, kept in kennels and raised in breeding pits that produced monsters to rival those defending Nessus.\n\nTechnically, the city was ruled by the [[pit fiend]] [[Gazra]], although he answered directly to the archdevils, from a crystalline castle housing a legion of 5,000 hamatula reserves. His forces, also comprising bone devils, were responsible for hunting down deserters, capturing unauthorized souls that slipped past the upper layers, spotting corruption amongst officers and checking the paper work for mortals and devils alike. Many unwary souls were killed by the zealous guardsmen as well as the hellish environment, so few came to Phlegethos by accident, although intruders weren't much better off, being imprisoned in the seemingly inescapable dungeons under Abriymoch.\n\nAbriymoch was also home to the [[Diabolical Courts]], a maddening complex of loopholes and ancient precedents where various legal disputes between devils could be settled and souls condemned by an infernal contract could petition for their freedom. Ironically, despite being a place of unflinching law, matters of security and legalistic argumentation, Abriymoch was also a respite for many devils. Many of the laws governing Abriymoch allowed it to be run as a kind of carnal carnival, filled with infernal versions of taverns, theaters, casinos and various other establishments for the fulfillment of darker desires.",
            "Fierna's Palace": "A key example of Phlegethos's pleasurable aspects was Fierna's palace, a slender, serpentine tower of crystal outside of the city, wreathed in blue flame and surrounded by a ring of magma pools. Only she and her closest companions were allowed inside since Belial spent a majority of his time there. Exorbitant marble halls and a bejeweled decor could be found deep within the tower,"
        },
        "Activities": "Fierna's presence was rarely noticed in Phlegethos, as she spent most of her time losing herself in pools of lava as others made decisions regarding the actual rulership of the plane. Although commonly thought of as Belial's mouthpiece, this wasn't entirely accurate, but part of a half-truth perpetuated by the Archduchess. Much of her pool time was spent with Belial as the two discussed strategems; rather than Fierna being a nominal puppet ruler or Belial being the true power behind the throne, both took a role in the decision making, albeit with Fierna being more preoccupied with her comforts. She was rightfully thought of as insatiably lustful, thoughtlessly going through members of the opposite gender, a trait she seemed to have adopted from her father.\n\nFierna was known to capture many [[nymph]]s from the [[Feywild]] to give as gifts and trophies to her loyal servants.{{cite dragon/419/The First Wielders|20}} Given her unexpected immunities, some theorized that Fierna was trying to master a second element, possibly in order to take over one of the colder layers of Hell, although she seemed generally uninterested in gaining new territory.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Archdevils": "[[File:Belial and Fierna.jpg|thumb|Fierna with her father, Belial.]]\nFierna's father Belial was the original archdevil of Phlegethos, and though many devils thought he was in decline and were waiting for Fierna to fully depose him, the two shared an unbreakable blood bond tightened by mutual necessity. He was adept at, if not quelling, focusing Fierna's fury similarly to how one controlled a fire. He also served as Fierna's mentor, teaching her from within the [[Hall of One Thousand Sighs and Screams]] of her palace about everything he knew regarding the \"arts of love and pain.\"\n\nHowever, the strength of their ties had undergone severe strain with the rise to power of Fierna's second role model, [[Glasya]]. Close even before becoming the Archduchess of [[Malbolge]], Fierna's relationship with Glasya was perhaps the closest that devils came to having \"best friends.\" The Fiery Lady became friends with the Lord of the Sixth fairly fast, and spent much of her time within the latter's fortress in Malbolge, returning home to proclaim new initiatives. She seemed absolutely infatuated with Glasya and couldn't stop talking about her whenever she was brought up, her search for greater autonomy being in no small part a result of her influence. Some of her decisions were made with Glasya's advice while others were Fierna imitating her close friend, but the relationship between the two nonetheless fostered uncertainty and discomfort in Belial.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|4-5}}\n\nBelial's ally, [[Baalzebul]], was wary of Fierna given her relationship with Glasya, since Asmodeus's daughter ruled over his former domain. If, however, Belial was to come to Baalzebul's aid then [[Mephistopheles]], the Lord of [[Cania]] and Baalzebul's rival, would likely try to use Belial's daughter against him, preferably as a partner but as a hostage if needed.",
            "Dukes": "Belial's consort and Fierna's mother was the late [[Naome]], a shrewd, well-regarded devil with a light sense of humor, appreciated for her level-headedness and ability to bargain. Like the rest of her family she enjoyed a good fight, battling with both spells and a long [[scimitar]].\n\nOf Fierna's servants, one of the most loyal was the archdevil [[Bathym]], a [[nightmare]]-riding knight with a black cloak and armor. He had served Belial loyally through the [[Reckoning]] but afterwards swore himself to Fierna after Belial cravenly placed her on his throne. Even before that, Bathym had secretly coveted Fierna, partially out of a belief that if he could seduce her, he could advance and potentially rule over all of Phlegethos.{{Cite dragon/360/Infernal Aristocracy: The Dukes of Hell|46-48}}\n\nThere was also Gazra, who served not only as her general but as a constant companion and consort responsible for dealing with the uninteresting matters of statecraft. Though loyal to Fierna, [[Levistus]] occasionally attempted to convert him to his side, temptations he managed to resist, and Fierna was careful enough not to grant him too much power and remind him of her authority if he showed signs of turning against her.\n\nLess interested with the Archduchess was [[Tymphal]], a mechanical master smith whose lesser devil legions and hundreds of [[duergar]] slaves toiled in a volcano forge to produce weapons and infernal [[construct]]s. Her reckless passion led him to isolate himself in his forge, making a conscious effort to avoid the happenings outside of his domain."
        },
        "Worshipers": {
            "Aspects": "Fierna's [[aspect]]s enjoyed company regardless of the activity and almost always were accompanied by at least one devilish bodyguard. Though less potent, their exotic beauty still inspired lust on sight and they preferred environments similar to Phlegethos, although it was less out of personal comfort, since they didn't really notice the difference, and more out of the pragmatic advantage of being in them. They more commonly appeared in the Nine Hells than in [[Faerun]], at least before Fierna had gotten to grips with creating them, but occasionally appeared to commemorate the establishment of a new cult, a job typically performed by [[erinyes]].<ref name= \"FAII\"/>"
        },
        "History": {
            "Forlarren": "Fierna once tried to court a mighty [[archfey]], hoping to seduce them into relinquishing their soul. Her efforts ultimately went nowhere, but a group of the lord's [[satyr]]s became infatuated with her. Desiring some form of gain from her time spent on the lord, Fierna decided to corrupt the satyrs with her infernal powers and transformed them into the creatures known as [[forlarren]].<ref>"
        },
        "Rumors and Legends": {
            "Naome": "The death of Naome was another point of contention in diabolical gossip circles. Although it was once reported that Asmodeus destroyed Naome as punishment for the Reckoning, another theory put forth that she died before it had truly begun. Naome had never been particularly fond of Glasya and had potentially called out her nefarious scheme to start the Reckoning. She wisely suggested that Belial ease the tensions between groups, but before the archdevils could be united by their common foe in the [[Abyss]], Glasya, according to the rumors, assassinated Naome.\n\nMost archdevils suspected that the latter rumor was true, a rumor that Fierna must have eventually heard but which she either didn't believe or wasn't bothered by. Although some wrote off their alliance as relative newcomers sticking together, others believe that Glasya was actually using Fierna for her own plans. Glasya had made clear many times her intent to kill Levistus, pursuing some ancient vendetta against their family, and her alliance with Fierna may have been a way of compensating for her lack of connections with the [[Dark Eight]] or general military might. Though Belial had long been plotting to invade Stygia, Fierna had little interest in conquering the frozen wasteland, and eventually Glasya could end up calling on her friend for aid in supplanting the Frozen Prince."
