Brimstone Speakers were divine casters that saw truespeak as a gift from their gods. They blended divine magic with truespeak in a way that allowed them to breathe flame, and to summon celestials, in their unending quest to purge all evil.
A brimstone speakers signature ability, the first one they uncovered, was an utterance such that it granted them a tongue of flames which scoured  straight ahead of them with fiery power. The next ability they mastered was the heavenly entreaty while at first, it was lesser, fetching only the aid of a Bralani eladrin, with increasing mastery they gained the ability to summon word archons or ghaele eladrins, and finally an astral deva. Alongside their increasing mastery, they developed a harder-burning tongue of flames.
Their practice of the Power lagged somewhat, and one who pursued the path to the end would likely never achieve its strongest spells.
Brimstone speakers were common in the churches of Lathander and more rarely Kossuth. Common starts as brimstone speakers came from a prospective speakers superiors noticing they combined zealotry with scholarly patience, and being taught the truename of the tongue of flames from there, they were expected to balance both pursuits themselves. They generally operated from small organizations within their churches, rarely being there organizations of brimstone speakers operating on their own.
