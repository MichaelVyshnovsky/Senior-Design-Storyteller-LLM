        "Activities": "As with others of Oghma's clergy, lorekeepers spent their time either secluded within libraries or temples, spending their time studying, copying, and preserving lore, or out in the world hunting down the tomes and [[scroll]]s that filled their libraries.<ref name=FaA-p133\"/>",
        "Abilities": "Though they carried blunt weapons, lorekeepers preferred to wrestle during combat, a skill at which they were quite adept. They were also quite skilled in [[Turn undead|turning]] creatures native to the [[Outer Planes]].<ref name=FaA-p133\"/>\n\nLorekeepers gained access to several powers as they progressed in rank. They could ''[[identify]]'' items once per day so long as they were within a temple, shrine, or other area sanctified by Oghma. They could cast ''[[friends]]'' once per day and ''[[mass charm]]'' twice per tenday. Similar to their ability to ''identify'', lorekeepers could cast ''[[legend lore]]'' twice per tenday if they were within an area sanctified by Oghma.<ref name=FaA-p133\"/>",
        "Possessions": "Lorekeepers were only allowed to use blunt weapons. They never used [[shield]]s, but wore [[armor]] no heavier than [[banded mail]]. They wore the traditional ''[[kantlara]]'' which was made unique by their own sigils and incriptions. Lorekeepers wore a ceremonial box-like hats during special religious events held on sacred ground.<ref name=FaA-p133\"/>"
