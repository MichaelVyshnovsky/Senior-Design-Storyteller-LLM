Deities of this domain taught patience and hard work and were patrons of artisans, blacksmiths, and metal workers. They also encouraged the recovery of lost mines and magic items, as well as the search for the materials and recipes for the creation of powerful items.\nNovice spellcasters were able to freely cast identify and searing smite, and later heat metal and magic weapon. Clerics of some experience could cast elemental weapon and protection from energy and later fabricate and wall of fire. Those that were masters of this domain had access to animate objects and creation.\nIn addition, Forge domain clerics gained access to the power artisans blessing."
