        "mainbody": "Chaos knights were specialty priests of the Church of Talos whom the Destroyer created to spread all forms of destruction.\nThey also served Talos as spiritual advisors to his crusaders.\nAll chaos knights where human. They considered destruction to be a form of art and encouraged others to partake in random acts of destruction. All of them tended to have at least a hint of insanity. Some perished as a result of their fervent need to destroy, but all died with a smile on their face in service to Talos.\nChaos knights could detect good up to  away in a single direction at will. They could both turn and command undead, provided the undead were not sentient.\nThey could use their touch, or utter a prayer, to foul holy water once per day. They received additional spells from the chaos sphere.\nThey could not cast any spells that healed, restored, or combated poison, but the reverse of these spells was available to them. Furthermore, healing spells did not work on a chaos knight.\nBecause of their plate or splint mail and full helms, chaos knights did resemble knights more than clerics. Their armor and helmets were jet black. They carried a black shield displaying the lightning bolts of Talos on its face. A black cloak, fringed with yellow stitching, completed their attire. Chaos knights favored the bastard sword in combat. Their swords were issued to them by the Church and they became intimately familiar with them, making them more efficient when wielding their specific sword in combat when compared to any other bastard sword."
