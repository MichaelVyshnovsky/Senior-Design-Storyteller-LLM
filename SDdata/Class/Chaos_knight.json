        "Activities": "They also served Talos as spiritual advisors to his [[crusader]]s.",
        "Culture": "All chaos knights where [[human]]. They considered destruction to be a form of art and encouraged others to partake in random acts of destruction. All of them tended to have at least a hint of insanity. Some perished as a result of their fervent need to destroy, but all died with a smile on their face in service to Talos.",
        "Abilities": "Chaos knights could ''[[detect good]]'' up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} away in a single direction at will. They could both [[Turn undead|turn]] and [[command undead]], provided the [[undead]] were not sentient.\n\nThey could use their touch, or utter a prayer, to foul [[holy water]] once per day. They received additional [[spell]]s from the [[chaos sphere]].\n\nThey could not cast any spells that healed, restored, or combated poison, but the reverse of these spells was available to them. Furthermore, healing spells did not work on a chaos knight.",
        "Possessions": "Because of their [[Plate mail|plate]] or [[splint mail]] and full [[helm]]s, chaos knights did resemble [[knight]]s more than [[cleric]]s. Their [[armor]] and helmets were jet black. They carried a black [[shield]] displaying the lightning bolts of Talos on its face. A black [[cloak]], fringed with yellow stitching, completed their attire. Chaos knights favored the [[bastard sword]] in combat. Their swords were issued to them by the Church and they became intimately familiar with them, making them more efficient when wielding their specific sword in combat when compared to any other bastard sword."
