        "mainbody": "'''Enki''' was a god with several connections to the gods of [[Toril]], although he was never worshiped on that world. He was god of rivers and oceans among the ancestors of the [[Mulan]], and also the patron of jewelers, goldsmiths, and stonecutters.",
        "Description": "Enki was a shapeshifter, but in all his [[human]] forms he was recognizable by his green skin. He carried a small [[mace]] carved from green jade. His armor and shield were made from water.",
        "Powers": "He could summon any being that died in the water, he could move like a [[blink dog]], and he was immune to all forms of heat. He was known as a binder of [[demon]]s; his hatred for the fiends so great that he would slay any being in his presence who had ever interacted with demons in a friendly way.",
        "Relationships": "Enki was a son of the [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric deity]] Nammu. He was once a lover of [[Lliira]]. He once had a wife, Nin-Hursag.",
        "Realm": "Enki once dwelled in a realm called the Waterwheel in the Clockwork [[Nirvana]] of [[Mechanus]]. There, he dwelled in a multifaceted ziggurat-like palace made from crystal and [[jade]].",
        "History": "Enki was the son of Anu, Ruler of Heaven, who was the son of Nammu, the sea.\n\nA suspicious plague decimated the empire of [[Imaskar]] sometime around {{Yearlink|-4370}}. In response, Imaskari wizards opened two portals to two different places and times on [[Earth|another world]]. They captured slaves from that world in a series of lightning raids. On Toril, the slaves intermarried with one another and became known as the Mulan. Although the Imaskari had created a barrier around Toril that denied entry to the gods of the Mulan homeworld, the prayers of the slaves were heard by [[Ao]], who summoned the god [[Ptah]] to invite the Mulan gods to come to Toril. Because of the barrier, the only way the gods could enter Toril was by creating avatars to physically sail through the Flow between spheres. To this end, Enki created a ship known as the ''[[Galley of the Gods]]'' for his fellow gods to sail in, while the children of [[Re]] sailed a war galley known as the ''[[Matet]]''. Enki himself elected not to follow the Mulan gods on this journey, and remained behind. Thus, he was never actively worshiped by anyone on Toril, but other gods of Toril could still interact with him on the planes.\n\nIn approximately [[1357 DR]],{{LliiraImprisonment}} the goddess [[Lliira]] became enamored with Enki and the two began a romance. Unfortunately, the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian goddess]] of [[magic]] [[Hecate]] became infatuated with Enki as well, so to rid herself of her rival, Hecate cursed Lliira so that she could return no man's love and imprisoned her in a \"Pleasure Palace\" called Zannibar on an unnamed world. Thanks to the efforts of an adventuring party, however, Lliira and Enki were reunited.\n\nShortly after that, tragically, Enki was murdered by the gods Anshar and [[Nergal (deity)|Nergal]]. Nergal lured Enki to a place on the [[Lower Planes]] known for its many demons. Then, while he was distracted, Nergal bound Enki and his co-conspirator Anshar drove a blade through his heart. Enki's father Nammu swore to avenge his son, but was yet to find an opportunity.\n\nBefore the [[Faction War (conflict)|Faction War]], the [[Sign of One]] faction of [[Sigil]] debated whether to attempt to use their supposed powers of imagination to will Enki back to life as a demonstration of the truth of their philosophy.",
        "Relics": "Enki was said to have created the ''[[Galley of the Gods]]'', a magical ship used by the [[Untheric pantheon]] to come to [[Faer√ªn]] and later by the people of [[Unther]] in several naval battles."
