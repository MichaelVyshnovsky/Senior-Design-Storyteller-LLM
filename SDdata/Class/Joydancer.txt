'''Joydancers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Lliira]], Our Lady of Joy.

==Culture==
Members of all races could become joydancers.

==Abilities==
Joydancers were skilled tumblers and acrobats. Given their heightened sense of balance and awareness of their body, joydancers were also quite skilled at unarmed combat. They could utter a ''[[soothing word]]'' once per day that would remove all emotion-affecting [[magic]] from anyone standing within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. The ''soothing word'' could also be used to make their allies slightly quicker to react to dangerous situations.

In addition to their memorized [[spell]]s, joydancers could cast a number of [[spell]]s on a daily basis including ''[[bliss]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[deadly dance]]'', ''[[candle of calm]]'', and ''[[Starella's aphrodisiac]]''.

==Possessions==
Though they were permitted to use bludgeoning weapons in extreme circumstances, most joydancers wielded either a [[net]] or [[lasso]]. A joydancer who used a weapon that inflicted pain upon another risked having their magical abilities revoked until the attoned for their actions. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
