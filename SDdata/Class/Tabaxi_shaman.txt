Tabaxi shamans, or spiritlords as they were also called, were specialty priests devoted to Ubtao, the Father of the Dinosaurs within the Chultan pantheon.
Spiritlords protected their tribe from offending ancient spirits or elemental creatures.
They were usually human Tabaxi.
They carved a special mask that served as the home of the very first spirit called. Their spirit could cast several spells selected by the spiritlord on their behalf. Having their spirit mask in close proximity made it more difficult for the spiritlord to be surprised.
Tabaxi shamans wielded clubs, spears, kerries, and yklwas. They usually wore dinosaur hide armor and carried a hlang.
