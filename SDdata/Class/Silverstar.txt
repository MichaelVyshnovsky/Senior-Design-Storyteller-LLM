A '''silverstar''' was a [[specialty priest]] of [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden. They were warrior priests armed with much moon-related [[magic]].

==Activities==
These followers of the Moonmaiden defended the weak and the oppressed and they would not stand [[slavery]]. They worked to cultivate harmony among both [[lycanthrope]]s and other people.

Silverstars generally operated in either big cities by the coast that relied on the sea for food and trade, or on the edges of civilization, where lycanthropes were often found. However, they would not stay in one place for a great length of time, instead being grabbed by a new cause or mission or simple wanderlust, and would soon move on.

==Culture==
They were an elite group within the [[church of Selûne]]. Silverstars were devoted advocates of freedom and tolerance and were dedicated seekers of truth. They were considered to be close to the goddess.

They were thought to be "touched" with prophecy and they occasionally received visions from their goddess. They commanded lunar energy and some of the power of the moon in order to serve Selûne's aims on [[Toril]].

==Possessions==
They could wear any [[armor]] and wield any bludgeoning [[weapon]], but they favored the [[Moon's Hand]], a smooth-headed [[mace]].

==Abilities==
Throughout history, Silverstars proved themselves to be proficient in [[astrology]] and navigation.

In the time of Netheril, silverstars were immune to ''[[maze]]'', ''[[guards and wards]]'', and other spells and effects that confused direction or cause one to get lost.

In the hands of a silverstar, a magical or even mundane ''[[Moon's Hand]]'' mace was more accurate and more damaging, and harmed creatures that could only be hurt by [[item enchantment|enchanted]] weapons. Later on some silverstars learned to treat any [[heavy mace]] they wielded as a Moon's Hand, transforming it into an enchanted weapon with ''[[shock]]'' and later ''[[shocking burst]]'' powers.

===Spellcasting===
[[File:Silverstar LoD.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''A female silverstar healing an injured man in the late 15{{th}} century DR.'']]
Many years before the [[Era of Upheaval]], during the time of ancient [[Netheril]], silverstars could cast spells such as ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[locate object]]'', ''[[locate creature]]'', ''[[abjure]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', ''[[dream]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', and ''[[restoration]]'' or ''[[regenerate]]''.

''Circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], Silverstars could cast certain bonus [[spell]]s, namely ''[[starshine]]'', ''[[moonbeam]]'' or [[lower water|''lower''/''raise water'']], ''[[moon blade]]'', ''[[moon path]]'' or ''[[true seeing]]'', the latter of which was known as "prophet's sight". After [[1372 DR]] they could freely cast [[Moon domain]] spells, and finally received the ''[[moonfire (spell)|moonfire]]'' spell.

===Powers===
Silverstars could also [[turn undead]] like other [[cleric]]s, and were also granted [[infravision]] to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. After 1372 DR, they instead received [[low-light vision]], known as "lunar sight".

Veteran silverstars could launch shooting stars from a hand or their eyes, up to three per [[tenday]], to a distance of {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}}. These glowing projectiles with tails of fire exploded on impact or at the end of their range and caused much damage over {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}. After 1372 DR, they could only project small orbs of glowing lunar energy from their eyes. Referred to as the ''tears of Selûne'', these motes were similar to ''[[dancing light]]s''.

Also around that same time, senior silverstars learned to resist [[Shadow Weave]] magic with a power called "moonshield", becoming resistant to [[enchantment]]s, [[illusion]]s, and [[necromancy]] and against spells of darkness, whatever the source of the magic.

===Lycanthropy===
[[File:Silverstar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Human]] and [[werebat]] silverstars, with the moon and Selûne's holy symbol in the background.'']]
An experienced silverstar was not immune to [[lycanthropy]], but they could take some control of the condition if infected. If the infecting lycanthrope was [[chaotic good|morally upstanding, without any care for ethical standing]], or the moral and ethical outlook of that creature was in line with that of the silverstar, then the priest or priestess of Selûne became a natural lycanthrope, rather than an afflicted one. In those cases, the silverstar could control their transformations, and thanks to the blessing of Selûne, they were not vulnerable to [[silver]] weaponry. However, any transformed being that turned to [[evil]] could not remain a silverstar. Furthermore, their memory in their animal or hybrid forms remained intact in their humanoid forms.

==Relationships==
They were utterly opposed to the machinations of Selûne's twin sister, [[Shar]], and her followers. They despised most kinds of [[undead]].

==Members==
A being of any race could become a silverstar, but they were required to be reasonably wise and hardy In the time of [[Netheril]], they could be any [[good]] alignment, but in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] they were required specifically to be [[chaotic good]].

They needed to be capable in battle, especially in the dark or when unable to see, and to master a combat style based around dodging and making mobile attacks. They should be skilled in finding their way and in scrutinizing the motives of others. They also needed the ability for divine [[magic]]; [[cleric]]s needed access to the Moon domain. Most began as clerics, others as [[ranger]]s.

The clergy of the [[House of the Moon]] temple in [[Waterdeep]] counted at least 50 silverstars among its number around [[1370 DR]],<ref> with senior members often becoming silverstars. Two high-ranking silverstars were guarding the ''[[Wand of Four Moons]]'' here at all times.<ref><ref>

===Notable Silverstars===
* [[Feluna Moonstar]], a [[werecat]] silverstar at the House of the Moon<ref>
* [[Naneatha Suaril]], high priestess of the House of the Moon
* [[S'feria Ranul]], a [[drow]] Silverstar from the city of [[Silverymoon]] and the leader of the [[Sisters of the Blood Moon]] adventuring group ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].<ref>
