'''Plumaweavers''' held an honored position in [[Maztica|Maztican]] culture. They weaved [[pluma]] magic to help ease the hardships of life for those around them. 

==Culture==
Plumaweavers were cosmopolitan, found in cities and villages. When they weren't working on featherweaving projects, they were assisting their neighbors. When they created an object of pluma, they often gifted it to an individual they felt deserved such a gift. 

Plumaweavers were nearly always of a [[lawful good]] alignment.

==Abilities==
Plumaweavers were proficient in the use of several weapons. [[Bow]]s, [[sling]]s, and [[club]]s were the weapons most plumaweavers learned how to use. They were also proficient in healing, animal lore, tracking and hunting, and of course weaving.  

Plumaweavers were experts in pluma magic, also know as feathermagic. Pluma was bestowed by [[Qotal]], the Feathered Dragon. Plumaweavers learned new spells as they practiced their art, but advancing in skill levels was a slow process. Plumaweavers were often [[human]] although [[Dog People|dog people]] and [[Desert dwarf|desert dwarves]] were known to become plumaweavers as well.
