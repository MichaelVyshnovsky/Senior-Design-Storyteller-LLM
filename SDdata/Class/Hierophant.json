        "mainbody": "'''Hierophants''' were high-ranking [[clerics]], [[druids]], or other [[divine]] spellcasters.",
        "Culture": "Hierophants were higher-ranked members of clergy and [[druid circle|druidic circles]]—often exemplars of their faith—who decided to temporarily forgo gaining the highest levels of divine [[spell]]s in order to concentrate on mastering what they already possessed. This had the chief consequence of them having spells that were much more potent than normal, allowing hierophants to heal and damage much more efficiently and powerfully through understanding rather than calling on more involved prayers.\n\nClerical hierophants were found among many faiths. In the [[church of Ilmater]], [[monk]]s of the [[Broken Ones]] and [[paladin]]s of the [[Order of the Golden Cup]] who were also clerics could train as hierophants. Similarly, paladins of [[Horus-Re]]'s [[Claws of the Sun and the Ankh]] and [[Lathander]]'s [[Order of the Aster]] could also become hierophants.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7-8}}\n\nOriginally, a hierophant was a druid who had risen to the rank of Grand Druid, the highest rank in their order, but stepped down again from that position. That change resulted in a loss of some of the druid's spellcasting power, but with new experience they gained certain spell-like abilities.<ref>{{Cite dragon/93/Life beyond 15th level}}<ref>",
        "Requirements": "Hierophants needed to have extensive knowledge of religious lore, the ability to use [[metamagic]], and the power to cast high-level divine spells.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Hierophant DMG.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A hierophant of another world.'']]\nAs they advanced, a hierophant could learn a handful of unique powers, selected from the following.\n\nHierophants could enhance how they handled [[Positive energy|positive]] or [[negative energy]]. With ''blast infidel'', spells channeling [[negative energy]] (such as ''[[inflict light wounds]]'' and so on) could be cast at maximum strength at beings of an [[alignment]] directly opposing their own. Similarly, with ''faith healing'', healing spells (such as ''[[cure light wounds]]'') could be be cast at maximum strength at beings of the same [[alignment]] as the hierophant, and on the hierophant themself. With ''mastery of energy'', a cleric hierophant could more effectively channel positive or negative energy and thereby [[Turn undead|turn or rebuke undead]] with greater force (depending on which they could do).\n\nHierophants could manipulate and enhance how they used their spells. They could increase the power at which they cast spells. They could also learn more techniques of metamagic. With ''divine reach'', spells applied with a physical touch could be done so at up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} or even {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nA hierophant could even share their god-given abilities with willing allies, but they remained beholden to their [[deity]] on these were used or misused. This lasted for a period of 1 to 7 days, during which the ability was denied to the hierophant themself. With ''gift of the divine'', a cleric hierophant could transfer the ability to turn or rebuke undead. This person turned or rebuked undead at the same strength as the hierophant, though the hierophant could use the power less often. With ''power of nature'', a druid hierophant could transfer any druid ability from themself to another, including wild shapeshifting, except for the ability to cast spells or have an [[animal companion]].\n\nFinally, a hierophant could turn one of their divine spells into an innate power they could use freely twice a day, or a lesser spell more often. They could even apply metamagic if they were capable of it.",
