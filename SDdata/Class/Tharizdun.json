        "History": {
            "Ancient History": "In the time when the [[multiverse]] was young, Tharizdun was a power hungry deity who was not happy with the idea of sharing the multiverse with the other gods, and for a long time he searched for something that would give him an edge against them.\n\nSome time later, when the gods were fighting the [[primordial]]s during the initial stages of what would be known later as the [[Dawn War]], Tharizdun returned, killed the guardian of the Living Gate and opened it, releasing corruptive energy from the Far Realm into the multiverse.\n\nBut the obyriths' plan to seize the celestial realms controlled by Tharizdun and his kind was met with resistance and a twist they had not anticipated. The obyriths demanded Tharizdun to plant the seed of evil within the [[Astral Sea]], promising him total dominion of that realm in exchange for his fealty. Even within his madness, Tharizdun recognized that his fellow gods would turn on him before he could fully seize the power the obyriths promised. Instead, the mad god traveled to the farthest reaches of the cosmos, planting the seed of evil in a primordial expanse of the churning [[Elemental Chaos]], which he hoped to seize as his own.\n\nThis seed eventually grew into the Abyss, and though the act gained him great power, the other gods of the multiverse temporarily put aside their differences in order to imprison him.",
            "Modern History": "In [[1340 DR]], a cult of Tharizdun formed in western [[Chessenta]]. It hired bandits, consorted with [[demon]]s, and caused much havoc before an alliance of forces destroyed it. Some credit the fact that Tharizdun did not gain a permanent foothold on [[Toril]] to the personal intervention of the goddess [[Mystra]].\n\nA new cult of Tharizdun was formed by the [[plague demon]] [[Murmur]] in [[1479 DR]] after a burnt portion of its corpse was discovered by the [[Firestorm Cabal]] in [[Akanûl]]. It possessed [[Leheren]], one of the members of the Cabal, and created a secret order within the order devoted to freeing Tharizdun and releasing him on the continent of [[Faerûn]].\n\nAt roughly the same time, the last of the [[Clan Sabrak|Sabrak clan]] of [[dwarves]] discovered an intrusion of the [[Abyssal Plague]] in a temple of [[Ghaunadaur]] in the mountains south of [[Easting]] and devised a way to transform victims of the plague into plague demons with which they hoped to create an army that would fight for the Elder Elemental Eye.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/214/The Elder Elemental Eye|66-67}}\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], several cults dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye arose in the [[Dessarin Valley]] trying to summon the Princes of Elemental Evil."
