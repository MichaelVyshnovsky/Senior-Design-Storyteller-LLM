        "mainbody": "Tharizdun (), also known as The Chained God and The Elder Elemental Eye, was a long-forgotten interloper god originating from Oerth who sought to destroy all that is. During the Dawn War, he created the Abyss, an act for which he was imprisoned by the gods. His followers hoped to set him free.\nTharizdun appeared as an amorphous, roiling pitch-blackness.\nTharizdun was not simply neutral evil his evil transcended law and chaos, reflecting a primal nature so ancient it went back to the early days of the Great Wheel cosmology.\nright|300px|thumb|Tharizduns symbol\nTharizduns exact dogma is unknown, as the ages he was imprisoned in the Abyss along with his own growing insanity left him unable to communicate in a meaningful manner. Even when he appeared to his followers, he only spoke to them in the form of a shrieking babble that was impossible for mortals to comprehend. The following are his assumed teachings, followed by his cults.\nTharizdun was one of the evil deities within the Oerthly, Dawn War, and Exandrian pantheons. He was worshiped only by mad people.\nIn the time when the multiverse was young, Tharizdun was a power hungry deity who was not happy with the idea of sharing the multiverse with the other gods, and for a long time he searched for something that would give him an edge against them.\nSome time later, when the gods were fighting the primordials during the initial stages of what would be known later as the Dawn War, Tharizdun returned, killed the guardian of the Living Gate and opened it, releasing corruptive energy from the Far Realm into the multiverse.\nBut the obyriths plan to seize the celestial realms controlled by Tharizdun and his kind was met with resistance and a twist they had not anticipated. The obyriths demanded Tharizdun to plant the seed of evil within the Astral Sea, promising him total dominion of that realm in exchange for his fealty. Even within his madness, Tharizdun recognized that his fellow gods would turn on him before he could fully seize the power the obyriths promised. Instead, the mad god traveled to the farthest reaches of the cosmos, planting the seed of evil in a primordial expanse of the churning Elemental Chaos, which he hoped to seize as his own.\nThis seed eventually grew into the Abyss, and though the act gained him great power, the other gods of the multiverse temporarily put aside their differences in order to imprison him.\nIn 1340 DR, a cult of Tharizdun formed in western Chessenta. It hired bandits, consorted with demons, and caused much havoc before an alliance of forces destroyed it. Some credit the fact that Tharizdun did not gain a permanent foothold on Toril to the personal intervention of the goddess Mystra.\nA new cult of Tharizdun was formed by the plague demon Murmur in 1479 DR after a burnt portion of its corpse was discovered by the Firestorm Cabal in Akanûl. It possessed Leheren, one of the members of the Cabal, and created a secret order within the order devoted to freeing Tharizdun and releasing him on the continent of Faerûn.\nAt roughly the same time, the last of the Sabrak clan of dwarves discovered an intrusion of the Abyssal Plague in a temple of Ghaunadaur in the mountains south of Easting and devised a way to transform victims of the plague into plague demons with which they hoped to create an army that would fight for the Elder Elemental Eye.\nIn the late 15 century DR, several cults dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye arose in the Dessarin Valley trying to summon the Princes of Elemental Evil."
