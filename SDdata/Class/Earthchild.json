These individuals were incredibly strong and hearty, while at the same time being rather awkward in social situations. They were skilled in mountaineering and similar skills and could detect slopes, grades, traps, pits, and deadfalls like a dwarf.\n\nEarthchildren could cast the following [[spell]]s once per day: ''[[detect metals and minerals]]'', ''[[dust shield]]'', ''[[dig]]'', ''[[conjure earth elemental]]'', ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[earthquake]]'', and ''[[sink]]''",
        "Possessions": "In addition to blunt weapons, some earthchildren used a [[pick]] in combat. Most favored metal [[armor]]."
