        "mainbody": "Indulgents were priests of the Church of Sharess who specialized in spying, seduction, and celebration.\nIndulgents went about their duties to the extreme.\nThough similar in their purpose to Sunes silkwhispers, indulgents performed their duties with a hint of a dark side influenced by Sharess. They did not shy from violence and cruelty when needed. Indulgents were extremely attractive men and women.\nIndulgents were quite skilled at prying secrets from anyone whom they spent a little bit of time with in a private setting. They could use their wiles to essentially charm a target for twelve hours. These abilities usually only worked on members of the indulgents race.\nThey could not turn undead.\nThey favored lace or satin garments usually decorated with patterns of red, white or black. A rich crimson cloak completed their ensemble. Their holy symbol was usually worn as an anklet. They never wore armor.\nIndulgents preferred smaller weapons such as daggers, darts, or garottes. They often carried debilitating non-lethal poisons as well."
