        "mainbody": "'''Specialty priests of Lucha''' were worshipers of [[Lucha]], known elsewhere as [[Sel√ªne]], within [[Durpar]] in the [[Shining Lands]].",
        "Culture": "These individuals, along with Lucha's common clergy, performed nearly all marriages with Durpar. They strove to drive the worship of [[Mask]] and other wicked [[god]]s from their homeland.",
        "Abilities": "These [[specialty priest]]s could [[turn undead]] like normal [[priest]]s. They were skilled navigators. They could cast ''[[locate object]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', ''[[locate creature]]'', ''[[moon blade]]'', ''[[moon path]]'', ''[[true seeing]]'', and ''[[find the path]]'' once per day.\n\nThey were immune to ''[[maze]]'' spells and other [[magic]] that attempted to confuse their sense of direction. They could cast ''[[protection from evil]]'' several times per day depending on their skill.",
        "Possessions": "They were permitted to only wield blunt weapons, [[lasso]]s, [[net]]s, or any other form of weaponry that allowed them to capture an enemy without breaking the skin. The first weapon they learned to wield was the [[quarterstaff]]. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they could wear. Their ceremonial dress consisted of a circlet woven of flowers with white robes and no footwear."
