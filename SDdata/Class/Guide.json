        "mainbody": "Specialty priests of Lucha were worshipers of Lucha, known elsewhere as Sel√ªne, within Durpar in the Shining Lands.\nThese individuals, along with Luchas common clergy, performed nearly all marriages with Durpar. They strove to drive the worship of Mask and other wicked gods from their homeland.\nThese specialty priests could turn undead like normal priests. They were skilled navigators. They could cast locate object, find the path, locate creature, moon blade, moon path, true seeing, and find the path once per day.\nThey were immune to maze spells and other magic that attempted to confuse their sense of direction. They could cast protection from evil several times per day depending on their skill.\nThey were permitted to only wield blunt weapons, lassos, nets, or any other form of weaponry that allowed them to capture an enemy without breaking the skin. The first weapon they learned to wield was the quarterstaff. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they could wear. Their ceremonial dress consisted of a circlet woven of flowers with white robes and no footwear."
