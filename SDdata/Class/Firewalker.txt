'''Firewalkers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Kossuth]], the Tyrant Among Fire.

==Culture==
These individuals were always [[gold elves]], [[moon elves]], [[half-elves]], [[fire giant]]s, or [[gnome]]s. However, elven and gnomish societies often looked with disdain upon members of their race who chose to become firewalkers.

==Abilities==
In addition to their [[divine magic]], firewalkers could cast [[wizard]] [[spell]]s related to fire. They enjoyed a degree of resistance to any magical or mundane fire attacks targeted at them. They could use the following abilities on a daily basis: ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', and ''[[fire charm]]''.

They could summon stronger and stronger [[fire elemental]]s as their skill improved. Especially powerful firewalkers could travel through the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] without the need for any kind of sustenance. Finally, firewalkers could work together to cooperatively summon an immense fire elemental to do their bidding.

==Possessions==
Firewalkers only wielded blunt weapons. They wore [[armor]] as heavy as [[chainmail]] and sometimes carried a [[shield]]. They were unable to use any [[magic item]]s related to water.
