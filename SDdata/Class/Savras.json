Following this, Azuth agreed to release Savras in exchange for a pledge of fealty.\n\nBut in the {{yearlinkName|1385}}, [[Cyric]] entered [[Dweomerheart]] with [[Shar]]'s aid and there murdered [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]. The plane broke apart, hurling Azuth and Velsharoon deep into the [[Astral Plane]] and killing Savras outright.\n\nYet he got better, returning to godhood by the 1480s DR. By [[1490 DR]], priests were still actively worshiping Savras in temples across [[Chult]]."
