She also owned a cloak with powers of [[cloak of protection|protection]] and [[cloak of displacement|displacement]], which similarly varied in potency. Her black-handled crop, which she used to stun her victims, was a potent artifact with the powers of a ''[[wand of wonder]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Zinzerena was a master deceiver in the mythology in the drow, with no member of the pantheon totally immune to her duplicity. Even Lolth, despite being otherwise impervious to her manipulation, was sometimes tricked when she shifted the blame for her deeds onto others. \n\nZinzerena's sponsor to divinity was Lolth's consort [[Keptolo]], who Zinzerena deceived and used as a tool in many stories regarding the [[Dark Seldarine]].

            "Dogma": "According to the teachings of Zinzerena, one was to raise themselves up by bringing others down. As patron of assassins and chaos, she taught the importance of stealth and misdirection, as well as doing whatever it took to get by. Her followers were not to reveal true feelings, nor their strength, until the one they planned to use them on was helpless, only striking when they had the advantage. Humiliation was also in her portfolio and cruelty was part of her creed, with her adherents encouraged to make time to gloat before the kill as \"the legs of the spider are made to be broken\"."
        },
        "History": "Zinzerena was born on a world other than [[Toril]], and had a known presence in the [[Underdark]] of [[Oerth]] (but not the surface) for a time. Stories told of her mortal exploits saw many drow view her as a hero to the point that some revered her as a goddess in her own right, their belief eventually allowing her to asecnd to godhood. The Oerthan deity Keptolo helped sponsor her apotheosis, after which she stole a fraction of her benefactor's power, earning his enmity. Before she could properly establish a worshiper base, a divine realm on the planes, and otherwise fully transcend her mortality however, Zinzerena found herself pursued by several members of the drow pantheon for her refusal to play by the rules.\n\nTrapped on the [[Material Plane]], Zinzerena eventually came to the city of [[Menzoberranzan]] on Toril where, in the wake of the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Lolth found and slew her (or at least banished her influence from the Realms), subsuming the Princess of the Outcasts as one of her aspects in order to attract the worship of drow who would otherwise rebel against her. This was partially as a test to see if multiple aspects would increase or decrease her own divine power, and some suspected that much of the chaos taking place that around the time attributed to Zinzerena was really Lolth's doing. \n\nPost [[Second Sundering]], Zinerena managed to return from Lolth's culling of the drow pantheon. Though she lost her previous influence over chaos, that instead going to [[Malyk]], she reclaimed the assassination part of her portfolio and reemerged with added power over lies and illusion.",
        "Rumors & Legends": {
            "The Capture of Zinzerena": "According to legend, a centuries-old Zinzerena —old even for a surface [[elf]], let alone a drow — was hired by a Lolthite noble named [[Alacantra]] to assassinate her older sister. In none of these tellings was the sister's name mentioned, but she had obtained greater authority in both their house and the Church of Lolth, and long had Alacantra coveted her sibling's position. Having never been caught or thwarted, Zinzerena accepted the task without hesitation, though knew that killing a priestess of Lolth and matriarch of a great house would be a challenge.\n\nHer senses augmented by magic, Zinzerena learnt her target's routines after watching her from afar for several days, and, as if they glowed in the dark, could see the mystic defenses surrounding her house. One night, when the matriarch had just returned home from a tiring day of rituals, Zinzerena moved in to complete her mission. She swept through the property knowing she could avoid the defenses like a spider could navigate its web, passing by the guards cloaked in illusion and wearing the shadows like a suit, scaling the great stone walls without stopping as if they were flat, and using wires and magic to unlock the matriarch's window, finally sneaking in unheard.\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 350px\n| source = An assembly of Lolthite priestesses to Zinzerena.\n| text   = Soon the name of Zinzerena will vanish from the lips and the ears of the drow.\n}}\nYet Zinzerena was captured the only way such a skillful assassin could be; betrayal. Alacantra was in fact working with her sister to create a new assassin's guild and could not abide Zinzerena as competition. Using her burgeoning cult as evidence towards her threat, they convinced the clergy of Lolth that she was a threat that had to be eliminated and drew upon all the community's resources to weave their trap. Hidden in the shadows and concealed from Zinzerena's scrying by layers of powerful magic were [[web golem]]s made by the church, [[construct]]s against which her illusions, poisons, and skills were useless, that came lumbering from the darkness to finally lay her low.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = 350px\n| source = Zinzerena to her priestess captors.\n| text   = You are cowards, and you are fools.
