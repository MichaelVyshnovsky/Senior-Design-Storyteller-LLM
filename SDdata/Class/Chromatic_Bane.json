        "mainbody": "hromatic Banes were divine champions of Bahamut who swore an oath to defeat the evil goddess Tiamat and her minions, especially evil dragons. Chromatics, metallics, or dragons of any other kind who were evil or servants of Tiamat became targets of the Chromatic Banes.\nChromatic Banes developed techniques that allowed them to resist draconic attacks and also helped their allies in battle against dragons. They also had access to a special spell granted to them by Bahamut, platinum mantle, which allowed them to channel divinity into a barrier to protect them and those with them against attacks that affected a large area, such as a dragons breath weapon."
