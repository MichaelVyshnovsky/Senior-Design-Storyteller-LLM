Tempests were specialty priests of the Church of Umberlee who were created by the Queen of the Depths to instigate inclement weather in order to receive donations from mariners hoping to avoid disaster.
A tempest protected sailors and vessels from violent storms or ensured peaceful sailing altogether. Their fees depended on the number of sailors onboard, and a separate fee was paid for the vessel itself. Thirty percent of these fees were donated to Umberlee, literally by tossing it into the sea.
Sometimes their abuse of the weather offended other deities such as Talos, Chauntea, Silvanus, and Eldath. An offended deity would intervene and negate the effects of the tempests magic, then send one of their druids to confront the tempest to show them the error of their ways, usually with forceful tactics such as call lightning.
Tempests often experienced rapid shifts in their moods from tranquil to violent in moments, usually triggered by some kind of offense. Despite their chaotic and wicked nature, a tempest could be trusted to offer their protection when their services were paid for. They were loyal to allies and extremely cruel to enemies.
They had access to a number of wizard spells that caused weather-related effects including wall of fog, fog cloud, whispering wind, lightning bolt, cone of cold, death fog, incendiary cloud, wind wall, solid fog, control weather, lower water, part water, and gust of wind. These spells were prayed for just like their normal clerical spells.
Tempests could not turn undead.
Similar to anchors, tempests dressed in a blue-green body stocking with a white cloak for warmth. Especially distinguished tempests also wore a rare tiara made from black coral. They never wore armor or carried a shield. Their favored weapon was the trident.
