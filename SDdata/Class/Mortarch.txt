Mortarchs were specialty priests of the Church of Kelemvor.
Mortarchs were specialized in the arts of funerals. Their main duties were to consecrate graves, maintain and pass on knowledge regarding burial customs, and to provide comfort to the grieving family members of the deceased.
Mortarchs used a unique version of the bless spell, which was cast on graves both to prevent the buried corpse from becoming undead and also to keep undead creatures away. This effect lasted a full year. Mortarchs were capable of turning undead creatures more powerful than themselves. They were unable to cast raise dead or resurrection or wield any magical item that duplicated the effects of those spells.
The dress of a mortarch were robes of dark blue and grey. They also wore a circlet of silver. The weapons carried by the priests were clubs, flails, or maces, which were always carefully concealed under these robes, in respect for mourners.
