        "mainbody": "Nakurits were specialty priests devoted to Ulutiu, the Lord in the Ice.\nNakurits were humans native to the Great Glacier called Nakulutiuns. They were distrustful of strangers nearly to the point of paranoia. The best a stranger could hope for usually was to just be ignored. \nA nakurits paranoia toward strangers fueld them in combat when facing one, making it slightly easier for them to strike and harm any non-Nakalutiun opponent. Particularly wise nakurits excelled at memorizing spells and usually had twice as many spells memorized as a regular priest. All nakurits were completely immune to all normal and magical cold effects. They could lay their hands on someone to cause physical harm that increased with their skill. They found it easier to resist spells cast at them from wizards. Nakurits could commune with Ulutiu on a weekly basis. They could command others once every ten minutes and cast prayer once per day. Particularly skilled nakurits harmed their enemies with biting cold in addition to the physical harm done by weapons when striking them during combat.\nThey typically wore leather or hide armor and never carried a shield. Some weapons favored by nakurits included the short bow, dagger, ritiik, spear, trident, and iuak."
