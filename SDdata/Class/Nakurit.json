        "mainbody": "'''Nakurits''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Ulutiu]], the Lord in the Ice.",
        "Culture": "Nakurits were [[human]]s native to the [[Great Glacier]] called [[Nakulutiun]]s. They were distrustful of strangers nearly to the point of paranoia. The best a stranger could hope for usually was to just be ignored.",
        "Abilities": "A nakurit's paranoia toward strangers fueld them in combat when facing one, making it slightly easier for them to strike and harm any non-Nakalutiun opponent. Particularly wise nakurit's excelled at memorizing [[spell]]s and usually had twice as many spells memorized as a regular [[priest]]. All nakurits were completely immune to all normal and magical cold effects. They could lay their hands on someone to cause physical harm that increased with their skill. They found it easier to resist spells cast at them from [[wizard]]s. Nakurits could ''[[commune]]'' with Ulutiu on a weekly basis. They could ''[[command]]'' others once every ten minutes and cast ''[[prayer]]'' once per day. Particularly skilled nakurits harmed their enemies with biting cold in addition to the physical harm done by weapons when striking them during combat.",
        "Possessions": "They typically wore [[leather armor|leather]] or [[hide armor]] and never carried a [[shield]]. Some weapons favored by nakurits included the [[short bow]], [[dagger]], [[ritiik]], [[spear]], [[trident]], and [[iuak]]."
