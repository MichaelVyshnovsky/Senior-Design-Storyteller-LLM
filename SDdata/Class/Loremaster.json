        "Abilities": "As a loremaster became experienced in gathering and using the knowledge obtained, they gained the ability to speak additional languages, remember tiny tidbits of helpful information, and enhance their own abilities.\n\nA loremaster learned information that they could apply to themself. The result was an improvement in the body's capabilities, additional skill in magic, or a new talent that they could use to their own benefit.\n\nA loremaster learned multiple additional languages, using them to gain more access to knowledge.\n\nA loremaster could use their knowledge to recall stories and histories. Later on, the loremaster could cast [[spell]]s to aid in uncovering information about [[magical item]]s and [[artifact]]s."
