        "mainbody": "A battlepriest of Cormyr was a priestly member of the Cormyrean Purple Dragons. They aided the military in battle and war while leading prayers for peace and prosperity.\nThe priests provided healing to their fellows, assisted with the planning of tactics, and sped along the pace of their comrades marching.\nThe battlepriests garnered a great deal of respect from their fellow soldiers. However their activities were monitored closely by the War Wizards, lest one of their ranks attain too much power and become a threat to the throne. The War Wizards actually looked down upon the battlepriests, commonly referring to them as \"spellbeggars\".\nBattlepriests learned how to shout out inspiring speeches before, as well heroic rallying cries during battle, that boosted the morale of their fellow soldiers. Perhaps the only thing more uplifting was the magical feasts fit for heroes, that battlepriests learned how to prepare. \nThey were trained in some form of alchemy, learning how to brew various types of potions.\nAs healing other soldiers was one of their primary duties, battlepriests learned to more effectively cast healing spells and form healing circles.\nThe most experienced battlepriests were a terrible sight to behold. The mere sight of them slaying another person in combat was more than enough to send some of their foes fleeing from the battlefield.\nWhile most battlepriests were clerics who venerated the deities Helm, Lathander, Sel√ªne, Tempus, Torm, Tymora, and Tyr, some among their ranks were also stalwart paladins."
