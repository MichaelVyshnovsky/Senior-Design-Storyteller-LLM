        "Activities": "Wormlucks were the harbingers of accidents and bad luck wherever they roamed, though they were just as much subject to [[Beshaba]]'s illfortune as those around them.",
        "Culture": "Wormlucks were fatalistic individuals who walked about with an air of gloom surrounding them. They believed all good luck was just one shoe out of a pair, and waited for the bad luck they knew was coming.",
        "Abilities": "Wormlucks could directly inflict a period of bad luck to anyone they chose. This ability could be used three times per week. The risk of using this ability was that there was a slight chance the wormluck would be the one to experience the bad luck instead of their chosen victim.",
        "Possessions": "A wormluck preferred a bright red [[robe]] worn on top of their [[armor]]. Regardless of their sex, all wormlucks wore white wigs in honor of Beshaba. The wormlucks were forced to wear wigs by Beshaba's other specialty priests, the [[doommaster]]s, so that there would be no confusion between the two."
