        "The children of [[Laduguer]] shall conquer the earth and stone from which they sprang and the voids in which they dwell. The seizing of new lands, new wealth, and new servitors is the manifest destiny of those who mine the Night Below.\n|An excerpt of Duerran dogma.\n}}": "=Description==",
        "The mind is but another material, set before us to shape into a weapon.\n|Gargosa Ironmind\n}}\n[[File:Duerracleric.png|right|thumb|250px|A [[cleric]] of Duerra.]]\n\nLike Laduguer, Duerra was venerated by the duergar to the near-exclusion of all other Morndinsamman members, the rest being only revered in name. Duerra's worshipers were primarily duergar that studied psionics and the militant warriors among the gray dwarves that chafed at the defensive ways of Laduguer's priests, those that sought to conquer much of the Underdark and would rather crush than cooperate with their neighbors.\n\nThough a few rare surface dwellers called upon the Queen for help in understanding, and more importantly concealing, the Invisible Art that was so often viewed with fear and suspicion, few outside the Underdark had heard of Duerra or her followers. Even [[hill dwarf|hill]] and [[mountain dwarves]] were unlikely to have heard of her, although a handful of hill, mountain, and [[jungle dwarves]] skilled in psionics secretly served her (making up less than a percentage of her followers).\n\nUnder the surface, Duerra's specific worshipers were known as ''norothor'', (norothar singular) a [[dwarvish dictionary|dwarvish word]] roughly translated as \"those who seize enemy land\". The vast majority of her clergy (97%) were female, and before the [[Time of Troubles]] they were entirely so. Being [[lawful evil]] wasn't a requirement to become one, with [[lawful neutral]]ity also being an option.": "==Dogma===",
        "Our gods sprang from among us. They endured our hardships and carved a path to our salvation. What has your god done for you?\n|Morkai Ashlord\n}}\nDuerra's deeds in the ancient past had long since become myth, spoken as legend in stories told by elderly duergar [[mindwarden]]s. Under Duerra's centuries long dominion, she had expanded the duergar empire to include the vast reaches of the Underdark, bringing the race to the pinnacle of their power.\n\nIn [[-1850 DR]],{{Cite polyhedron/110/Forgotten Deities: Deep Duerra}} the latter of which captured and transformed them long ago around [[-8100 DR]] to [[-8080 DR]]. It was on one of these occasions, according to dubious tales and legends, that Deep Duerra's forces overran the city of Oryndoll, shackling the resident mind flayers that had once done the same to them. Over the course of the next century, Duerra and her surgeons supposedly wrestled the many secrets and powers of psionics from the minds of the captive illithids, stealing the Invisible Art and transferring it to her clan's bloodline. So great was her psionic might, so the legends said, that she turned the entire illithid colony into her thralls. \n\n{{Fq\n| width": "400px",
        "source": "''[[Mordenkainen]]''",
        "text": "The mental powers that duergar wield was given to them by the illithids, no matter what the adherents of Deep Duerra might claim. Why, then, would the illithids create slaves that could turn invisible or grow to [[ogre]] size? Most likely because those slaves would excel at herding their masters' other chattel. In retrospect, it seems arguable that the duergar escaped bondage because their jailers had already given them the keys.",
        "mainbody": "Some doubted the accuracy of this myth, notably the mind flayers themselves. the duegar invasions of Oryndoll had occurred, and any potential embellishments aside, Duerra did at some point steal much energy and many of the psionic secrets of Ilsensine.\n\nSometime around [[-1800 DR]], Duerra's forces turned their simmering hate to the remnants of [[Deep Shanatar]]: [[Ultoksamrin]], [[Holorarar]], and the caverns of [[Alatorin]]. For her many successes, Laduguer rewarded Duerra with divine ascension, right before her immediate exile from the Morndinsamman. Since Duerra's departure, the Underspires fell into a centuries-long decline, fragmenting and contracting in her absence. Regardless of the questionable veracity of her legends, Duerra was honored by the duergar as the progenitor of their psychic powers, which not only established the gray dwarves as separate from other dwarves, but also enabling them to hold their own against drow magic and illithid psionics. The ancient queen was further worshiped for the uncompromised ambition she displayed to increase duergar dominion, and was revered as a symbol of duergar dominance through expansion and enslavement.\n\n===Time of Troubles===\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], when [[Ao]] forced the gods to walk [[Toril]] in avatar form, Duerra took the body of the [[Queen Mother]] of Underspires to be her mortal form. Duerra's return sparked a new age of empire-building, helping the city to emerge from its long torpor. The army of elites which she had assembled and trained had made attacks against the outlying settlements of [[Ironfang]] and Undreath, helping them to reach their highest level of readiness in centuries. The empire managed to expand their rule to Underdark tunnels beneath the [[Cloven Mountains]], reaching the deepest mines of [[Tathtar]]. When the Time of Troubles concluded that same year, Duerra disappeared to the southernmost reaches of the Underdark, her Queen Mother aspect's fate being unknown.\n\nThe Queen Mother was serving as regent for her young son [[Olorn Ridaugaur]], who ascended to the Underthrone upon her disappearance. He claimed to be Duerra's son, (a debatably true sentiment) and since his mother's departure, he had initiated a great military crusade to expand to the north, an attack so fanatical it was thought Duerra had granted him a ''[[warband quest]]'' spell.\n\nOver twelve years, his holy warriors had gathered for strikes against the underlands of [[Dragonreach]] held by the drow and studded with a few isolated dwarven and svirfbelin settlements. In little time, he had managed to crush many of the enclaves and overrun at least one minor drow city. At the same time, he had also sent his armies against the mind flayers of Oryndoll to the west beneath the [[Shining Plains]]. Despite their enthusiasm, the actual successes of these quick conquests had been few and far between, and the awakening empire had quickly created for itself a wide number of rivals and foes, potentially making it vulnerable to a concerted strike.\n\n===Death and Revival===\nIn [[1383 DR]], Moradin assembled other members of his pantheon to crush the forces of Hammergrim. Though [[Gorm Gulthyn]] and [[Haela Brightaxe]] died in the battle, [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] dispatched Duerra while Moradin slew Laduguer. Hammergrim dispersed into the [[Astral Plane]] to the sound of victorious battle hymns. She seemingly returned after the [[Second Sundering]].",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Duerra indicated her favor via the discovery of small pools of fresh, completely still water, and through the discovery of [[greenstone]]s, [[sapphire]]s and crown-like [[silver]] rings. If displeased, she was known to unavoidably ''[[feeblemind]]'' the annoyance."
        },
        "Personality": "Duerra was a pompous and arrogant authoritarian with the expectation that her every whim be immediately attended to. She dismissed [[arcane]] magic as inferior to psionic power, viewed the duergar as a unique race whose ancestral relation to other dwarves as an irrelevant piece of best forgotten trivia, and was resolute in her conviction that it was her inalienable right to rule.\n\nHowever, it was not the actual possession of territory that Duerra enjoyed, but the act of obtaining it; the Axe Princess was always plotting, planning, and strategizing for her next glorious conquest. Never content, Duerra was ruthless in her pursuit of assured victory, having no tolerance for anyone, no matter who they were, that didn't meet her expectations, and considering no sacrifice too great for her continued success.",
        "Powers": "An avatar of Duerra could cast spells from any [[sphere]] and use psionics of all types. Every minute at will, Duerra could cast ''[[deflect psionics]]'', though she herself was completely immune to any mind-affecting abilities, whether spells or psionics. She emitted a constant mental ''[[chant]]'' at all times, and allied duergar within {{SI|90|ft}} of her were fearless, even in the face of supernatural terror like a [[dragon]]'s aura.\n\nDuerra could only be harmed using enchanted weapons. Like some other dwarven gods, Duerra could enter a [[ghost]]-like anima form upon being killed. This phantasmal form couldn't be [[turn undead|turned]], could become invisible at will, and use any of her magic powers, though she was only half as durable in this state.\n\nDuerra could manifest her influence as a crown-like nimbus of silver light that surrounded a creature's head. For the next ten minutes, the target's reservoir of psionic power would quadruple, they would have some kind of psionic defense surrounding them (such as ''[[intellect fortress]]'', ''[[mental barrier]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[thought shield]]'', or ''[[tower of iron will]]''), and/or, like Duerra, their minds would be immune to magic tampering.",
        "Possessions": "The Axe Princess of Conquest's weapon was [[Mindshatter]], her enchanted [[battleaxe]] that, upon striking an enemy, could ''[[steal psionic strength]]'' and transfer it to its wielder. The enchanted, [[everbright]] [[chainmail]] armor she was clad in was both shimmering and ornate.",
        "Realm": "Like [[Laduguer]], Duerra's home was the pessimistic [[plane]] of [[Hammergrim]], a gray, massive fortress with windowless walls a mile thick. In Hammergrim's vast courtyard, Duerra had her own hall, her personal realm known as the [[Citadel of Thought]].",
        "Activities": "Aside from the constant formulization of military plans, Duerra was known to dispatch avatars to intervene in matters regarding the duergar and other races. Occasionally this was to aid in conflicts where the duergar faced psionic foes, particularly [[aboleth]]s and [[illithid]]s, and at other times it was because a duergar city had a perfect opportunity to expand their dominion at the expense of others, but, for whatever reason, the ruling duergar authority was unwilling to capitalize on it.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Others": "Among their list of foes were the [[derro]] gods [[Diirinka]] and [[Diinkarazan]], the [[beholder]] deities [[Gzemnid]] and the unnamed [[Great Mother]], as well as the entire [[drow]] pantheon. There were also the deep-dwelling gods [[Blibdoolpoolp]], of the [[kuo-toa]], the [[ixzan]] deity [[Ilxendren]], and the [[aboleth]]ic [[elder evil]] [[Pisaethces]]. [[Laogzed]] and [[Urdlen]], the ever-hungry gods of [[troglodyte]]s and evil [[gnome]]s respectively, were also among their enemies, with Urdlen specifically burrowing under Hammergrim's ore-rich earth looking for food. On the other hand, the duergar gods had less wicked opposition in [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], deity of the [[deep gnome]]s, [[Psilofyr]], protector god of the [[myconid]]s, and [[Shevarash]], the [[elven]] god of vengeance.\n\n[[Orcus]] was also an enemy of Duerra since the Prince of [[Undead]] once subverted the worship of duergar beneath the [[Mines of Bloodstone]]. Particularly fierce was the hatred between Duerra and [[Ilsensine]] (as well as [[Maanzecorian]] before he died), since the Queen of the Invisible Art had stolen much of the psionic secrets and energy from the Great Brain of the [[illithid]]s."

        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "[[File:Duerra_symbol.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Duerra's mind flayer skull symbol.]]\nDuerra's teachings were that it was the duergar's destiny to rule the Underdark, conquering the stone from which they were spawned, taking the voids in which they dwelt, and claiming the wealth and servitors that could be found within both. Inspired by her mythic accomplishments, her followers stood at the forefront of duergar offensives against the foes they hated most, dwarves and mind flayers, seeking to utterly obliterate such communities. She expected her priests to be capable leaders, and to use cunning strategy in their endless quest for unlimited power, part of their responsibilities being to train younger gray dwarves in the art of war and teach them Underdark survival techniques. While the Ladugueran clergy defended duergar holdings, senior mindaxes took their elite strike forces of duergar warriors and Duerran priests (as well as junior followers of Laduguer) on missions to scout, clear, and seize tunnel systems to help grow the community.\n\nAnother crucial facet of her faith was the supposed inferiority of arcane magic;",
            "Rituals": "Norothor prayed for spells at night. The duerran clergy had two annual holy days, during each of which an offering to Duerra was made in the form of dirt or stone from the borders of newly conquered land, the brains of psionic individuals, or the shattered skulls of any intelligent creatures."
