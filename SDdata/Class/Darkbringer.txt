'''Darkbringers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Moander]], the Rotting God.

==Culture==
Darkbringers were both male and female and could be any race.

==Abilities==
Any [[spell]] from the [[plant sphere]] cast by a darkbringer experienced double the normal area of effect and duration. They could cast several spells on a daily basis including ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[puffball]]'', ''[[handfang]]'', ''[[speed rot]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[rising rot]]'', ''[[speed rot]]'', ''[[spirit trap of the Darkbringer]]'', ''[[roots of the assassin]]'', and ''[[tentacle of withering]]''.

The effects of the ''plant growth'' spell varied when cast by a darkbringer. Firstly, the affected vegetation rotted and died after a tenday unless a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell was cast upon them. Secondly, all plant life within {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} of the spot where the spell was cast would become disease-ridden and die within a month unless a ''[[bless]]'' spell followed by ''dispel magic'' was cast within the area.

==Possessions==
Darkbringers did not have restrictions on the weapons they wielded in combat or the [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
