        "mainbody": "'''Deep diviners''' were spell practitioners of the [[Underdark]] that used the mystical energies of the deep places of the world to accomplish feats of [[magic]]. They were particularly impressive because of their use of [[node magic]], which involved manipulating deposits of magic within the Underdark, called [[earth node]]s.\n\nDeep diviners used earth nodes to enhance and refuel their own magic, which focused primarily on communicating with the stone that surrounded them and the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. They became quite formidable, eventually becoming capable of calling upon [[earth elementals]] and becoming one themselves.",
        "Abilities": "A deep diviner could detect the power and direction of earth nodes. However, even the thinnest layer of [[lead]] would block this ability.\n\nA deep diviner could ask questions of the pebbles, caves, and stalactites around him or her. The presence of the deep diviner allowed the stone in question to recall events from a limited time in the past. This proved quite useful in investigating recent events.\n\nA deep diviner could transform into a greater earth elemental for a limited amount of time. The deep diviner had all of the abilities of the elemental transformed into."
