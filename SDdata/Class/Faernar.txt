Faernor were specialty priests devoted to Berronar Truesilver, the Matron of Home and Hearth.
The vast majority of faernor were either gold dwarves or shield dwarves, but members of all of the dwarf races, to include both males and females, could become a faernar.
Most faernor were skilled healers and herbalists.
In addition to their normal spells, faernor could cast cure light wounds, aid, spiritual hammer, cure disease, detect lie, cure serious wounds, neutralize poison, fortify, cure critical wounds, succor of Berronar, wall of force, wall of iron, and wall of stone on a daily basis. They could also cast gate twice per tenday. Any protection sphere spells cast by a faernar were cast with skill beyond their current ability.
Faernor wielded battle axes, clubs, crossbows, flails, hand axes, maces and morning stars. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear.
