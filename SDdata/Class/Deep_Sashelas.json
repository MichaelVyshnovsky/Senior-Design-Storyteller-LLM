        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Deep Sashelas appeared to his worshipers in three different ways:\n* A twinkle of light from afar that, if followed by worshipers, led them to a safe place.\n* A small vent from which bubbles of air escape. He  appeared in this form in sea elf communities to warn them of a potential threat or attack.\n* A dolphin-shaped vision made of water with a silver glow. He used this form when communicating with sea elf communities."

        "Personality": "Deep Sashelas' presence was felt all across [[Toril]] and he sought to be on good terms with underwater races beyond the [[sea elves]]. To do so, he relied on the charisma that made him a natural leader, and on his skill as mediator.\n\nSashelas preferred to use [[water]]-based [[magic]] and avoided [[fire]] [[spell]]s.",
        "Activities": "Despite his involvement, his avatar rarely appeared to fight directly, but he made an exception if [[Sekolah]] or [[Panzuriel]] were involved. About half the time, he was accompanied by [[Trishina]]'s avatar. On rare occasions, he would appear with another ''[[asathalfinare]]'' member's avatar.",

            "Seldarine": "As a member of the [[Seldarine]], Deep Sashelas had good relationships with its other members. He answered directly to [[Corellon Larethian]].",
            "Dark Seldarine": "Deep Sashelas was an enemy of the [[Dark Seldarine]], but [[Eilistraee]] counted him as her friend.",
            "Asathalfinare": "Sashelas was the leader of the ''asathalfinare'' pantheon, and he had good relationships with its members ([[Eadro]], [[Persana]], [[Trishina]], and [[Surminare]]). His relationship was deeper with Trishina, his consort, specifically."
