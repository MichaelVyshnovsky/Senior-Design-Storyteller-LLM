        "mainbody": "'''Treetenders''' were [[gnome]] [[priest]]s of nature that devoted themselves to a [[druid]]-like lifestyle.",
        "Activities": "Like druids, treetenders vigorously sought to protect and preserve their environment against all threats. They lived hermetic lives, rarely interacting with fellow gnomes in their daily lives, though they were not complete recluses. A treetender would help usually any gnome that passed through their forest, sometimes even [[halfling]]s, and usually would make the trip to a local village in order to attend major festivals.",
        "Culture": "These nature priests were typically highly respected for their efforts to preserve their wilderness.",
        "Abilities": "All treetenders possessed an immunity to ''[[charm]]'' [[spell]]s cast by forest creatures and an ability to [[Pass without trace|leave no trace]] as they passed through overgrown areas. They could also identify any animal or plant, as well as pure water.\n\nTreetenders were skilled in using [[herb]]s and roots to make [[potion]]s, such as ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]'', and would typically carry such supplies around.",
        "Combat": "A treetender specialized in fighting with weapons crafted primarily from wood, such as [[bow]]s, though they were not opposed to using weapons with stone heads. If more than 10% of an [[armor]] or weapon's weight was made up of metal, they would not use it.",
        "Notable Treetenders": "* [[Lorth Blaenarry]], an [[Eldathyn]] treetender in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>"
