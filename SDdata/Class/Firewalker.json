        "mainbody": "Firewalkers were specialty priests devoted to Kossuth, the Tyrant Among Fire.\nThese individuals were always gold elves, moon elves, half-elves, fire giants, or gnomes. However, elven and gnomish societies often looked with disdain upon members of their race who chose to become firewalkers.\nIn addition to their divine magic, firewalkers could cast wizard spells related to fire. They enjoyed a degree of resistance to any magical or mundane fire attacks targeted at them. They could use the following abilities on a daily basis burning hands, fireball, and fire charm.\nThey could summon stronger and stronger fire elementals as their skill improved. Especially powerful firewalkers could travel through the Elemental Plane of Fire without the need for any kind of sustenance. Finally, firewalkers could work together to cooperatively summon an immense fire elemental to do their bidding.\nFirewalkers only wielded blunt weapons. They wore armor as heavy as chainmail and sometimes carried a shield. They were unable to use any magic items related to water."
