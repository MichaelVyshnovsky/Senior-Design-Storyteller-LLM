Darkwalkers were specialty priests devoted to Ibrandul, the Lord of the Dry Depths.
The vast majority of darkwalkers were human, with a large group of skulks inhabiting the Underdark beneath Calimshan. However, Ibrandul allowed other races to become darkwalkers as well. These included dwarves, gnomes, drow, and half-drow.
Any darkness-related spell cast by a darkwalker affected twice the normal area and duration. All darkwalkers could see in the dark with infravision, even if their race normally could not. Darkwalkers of a race that already possessed infravision had their range extended. They could use a number of abilities on a daily basis including darkness, dark path, continual darkness, blacklight, meld into stone, stone shape, and skulk. A darkwalkers eyes eventually became so accustomed to the dark that they could see in utter darkness as if it were daytime.
Darkwalkers did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they carried. The heaviest armor they wore was chainmail and they did not carry a shield.
