'''Darkwalkers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Ibrandul]], the Lord of the Dry Depths.

==Culture==
The vast majority of darkwalkers were [[human]], with a large group of [[skulk]]s inhabiting the [[Underdark]] beneath [[Calimshan]]. However, Ibrandul allowed other races to become darkwalkers as well. These included [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, [[drow]], and [[half-drow]].

==Abilities==
Any darkness-related [[spell]] cast by a darkwalker affected twice the normal area and duration. All darkwalkers could see in the dark with [[infravision]], even if their race normally could not. Darkwalkers of a race that already possessed infravision had their range extended. They could use a number of abilities on a daily basis including ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[dark path]]'', ''[[continual darkness]]'', ''[[blacklight]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', and ''[[Skulk (spell)|skulk]]''. A darkwalker's eyes eventually became so accustomed to the dark that they could see in utter darkness as if it were daytime.

==Possessions==
Darkwalkers did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they carried. The heaviest [[armor]] they wore was [[chainmail]] and they did not carry a [[shield]].
