        "mainbody": "Sibylites were specialty priests devoted to Savras, the All-Seeing One.\nThey spent much of their time in meditation seeking glimpses of the future.\nIn addition to divine magic spells, all sibylites could cast arcane spells from the divination school. Instead of memorizing these spells like a wizard, a sibylite would pray for them.\nThey gained a number of special powers depending on their advancement including augury, clairvoyance, detect lie, cure blindness, true seeing, magic font, reflecting pool, and consequence.\nAll sibylites eventually became immune to being surprised during combat or sneaked up on. Especially powerful sibylites could automatically perceive a targets true form regardless of any cloaking spells.\nSibylites did not wear armor, but could wield any bludgeoning weapon of their choice."
