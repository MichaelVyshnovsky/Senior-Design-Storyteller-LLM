        "Activities": "They spent much of their time in meditation seeking glimpses of the future.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to [[divine magic]] [[spell]]s, all sibylites could cast [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spells from the [[divination]] school. Instead of memorizing these spells like a [[wizard]], a sibylite would pray for them.\n\nThey gained a number of special powers depending on their advancement including ''[[augury]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[cure blindness]]'', ''[[true seeing]]'', ''[[magic font]]'', ''[[reflecting pool]]'', and ''[[consequence]]''.\n\nAll sibylites eventually became immune to being surprised during combat or sneaked up on. Especially powerful sibylites could automatically perceive a target's true form regardless of any cloaking spells.",
        "Possessions": "Sibylites did not wear [[armor]], but could wield any bludgeoning weapon of their choice."
