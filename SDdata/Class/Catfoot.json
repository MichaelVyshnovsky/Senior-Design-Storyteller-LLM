        "mainbody": "A '''catfoot''' was a [[specialty priest]] of the [[Church of Mask]] who belonged to one of two branches of [[cleric]]s designed to help bolster [[Mask]]'s worship following the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'' incident.<ref name=\"WaPotR-p92\" >\n\nThere was no plural word for catfoot as the clergy disliked the sound of \"catfeet.\"",
        "Activities": "A catfoot's locale was always an urban setting where they collected money from other [[thieves]], provided healing and general counsel, and came to the defense of other thieves.",
        "Culture": "In addition to the wealth they collected for the church, Mask encouraged a catfoot to steal wealth for themselves as well, provided he got his cut of course.",
        "Abilities": "A catfoot was intimately knowledgeable about their home city. This knowledge came in many forms including the best escape routes, shortcuts, safe houses, and which city guards could be bribed. A catfoot possessed all of the skills and abilities of common thieves.\n\nA catfoot could not [[turn undead]].",
        "Possessions": "They always dressed in either black or gray. If a catfoot chose to wear [[leather armor]] then it was dyed black or gray as well. They favored a black or dark blue hooded cloak worn with either a domino mask that covered their eyes or a full face mask. They carried any type of weapon used by common thieves."
