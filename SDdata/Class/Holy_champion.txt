Holy champions were specialty priests devoted to Torm, the Loyal Fury.
These specialty priests were both male and female and primarily humans. Through frowned upon by their cultures, elves, dwarves, and even centaurs could also become holy champions of Torm. They tithed one quarter of their income to the church at their home temple or shrine. Followers of holy champions were fiercely loyal.
They were usually skilled at riding horses. Holy champions could both turn and command undead, usually to serve as guardians in specific locations. In addition to their normal spells, holy champions could cast command, mount, hold portal, compel, detect lie, dispel evil, flame strike, power word, stun, power word, blind, and holy word once per day. Additionally, any divination or protection sphere spells cast by them lasted twice as long. They practised their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat similar to warriors.
Holy champions wielded the same weapons as normal clerics. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear.
