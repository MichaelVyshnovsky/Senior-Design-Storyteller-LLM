'''Holy champions''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Torm]], the Loyal Fury.

==Culture==
These specialty priests were both male and female and primarily [[human]]s. Through frowned upon by their cultures, [[elves]], [[dwarves]], and even [[centaur]]s could also become holy champions of Torm. They tithed one quarter of their income to the [[Church of Torm|church]] at their home temple or shrine. Followers of holy champions were fiercely loyal.

==Abilities==
They were usually skilled at riding [[horse]]s. Holy champions could both [[Turn undead|turn]] and [[command undead]], usually to serve as guardians in specific locations. In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, holy champions could cast ''[[command]]'', ''[[mount]]'', ''[[hold portal]]'', ''[[compel]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[dispel evil]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[power word, stun]]'', ''[[power word, blind]]'', and ''[[holy word]]'' once per day. Additionally, any [[divination]] or [[protection sphere]] spells cast by them lasted twice as long. They practised their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat similar to warriors.

==Possessions==
Holy champions wielded the same weapons as normal [[cleric]]s. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
