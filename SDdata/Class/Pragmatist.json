For example, a pragmatist worshiping a god of healing was usually found at a hospice.\n\nPragmatists moved around often, sometimes only holding a position for a few months before travelling to their next destination. Pragmatists were very tolerant of other faiths and their beliefs. It was not uncommon to find two pragmatists of \"opposing\" religions travelling together in harmony.\n\nEvery religion in Zakhara had a pragmatist wing, even those of the heavily moralist pantheon. The [[Temple of Ten Thousand Gods]] was the most popular church among pragmatists.",
