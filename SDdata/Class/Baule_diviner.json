Thus they also had access to spells from the [[Divine magic|priestly]] [[elemental sphere]], while their specialization precluded them from using [[conjuration/summoning]] magic.\n\nOutwardly, they could be recognized by their shaved heads, special red garments, and the golden rings they wore around their arms and necks.\n\nTheir insight into the ways of Fate was highly respected especially by [[Al-Hadhar|city-dwellers]], but they were known to reveal their wisdom only in a guarded way."
