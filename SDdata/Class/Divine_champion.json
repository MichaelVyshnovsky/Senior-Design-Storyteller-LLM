        "mainbody": "'''Divine champions''' were warriors in the service of a [[deity]] and their faithful, known in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Culture": "Divine champions were holy warriors, dedicated to their deity, their cause, and their church. They were seen as the strong right arms of their gods. They took the role of church-sponsored warrior commonly filled by [[paladin]]s in more [[good]]ly and [[lawful]] churches, particularly for deities whom paladins could not follow; however, every church could have divine champions.\n\nThe faithful and clergy of their churches loved them just as much as the foes of the church despised them. The battles between divine champions of opposing faiths were legendary, oft-told by bards over the centuries.\n\nMost of them had a military or otherwise combat-oriented background, most commonly paladins, [[fighter]]s, and [[monk]]s, as well as [[barbarian]]s and [[ranger]]s, and often militant clerics and [[druid]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7-8}} All members of the [[Bloodmoon Circle]], [[lycanthrope]]s dedicated to [[Malar]], were divine champions.<ref>",
        "Activities": "They fought to protect sacred sites and the priests and [[pilgrim]]s of their faith. They also served as leaders in crusades and battled to destroy their church's enemies, to defeat [[cleric]]s of rival gods, and slay mythical beasts.\n\nDivine champions opposed the faithful of deities who were enemies of their own, and selected one enemy deity to work against. For example, a divine champion of [[Selûne]] could be opposed to [[Shar]] and her worshipers.",
        "Requirements": "Divine champions were required to possess some learning in religious lore and excellent skill-at-arms, and to have focused on wielding their god's [[favored weapon]]. They also obviously needed a patron deity; they could not be considered [[Faithless]] or [[False]].",
        "Abilities": "Training as warriors, divine champions acquired proficiency with most traditional weapons if they weren't already. They could gain skills in athletic areas like climbing, leaping, and swimming; in riding and handling animals; and in the crafting of items. They could also learn to intimidate others and they might study religious lore.\n\nNotably, being defenders of the faith, divine champions possessed the ability to heal simply by [[lay on hands|laying on hands]] just like paladins. However, this only worked on those who shared their faith, and on the divine champions themselves, not on outsiders. For divine champions who were also paladins, this was separate from any other power to lay on hands they had.\n\nThey also advanced their martial training, by learning certain combat techniques. These could include expert defensive fighting, the ability to fight whilst visually impaired, and improved reactions for the start of battle, seizing an opportunity against a foe, or drawing their weapon swiftly. They could also continue to focus on their deity's weapon or on another, by gaining proficiency, improving skill in attack, or inflicting more grievous injuries. Alternatively, they could improve their ability to [[turn undead]] if they had it.\n\nThey also acquired a power known as \"sacred defense\", helping them resist [[divine]] [[spell]]s and the magic and supernatural abilities of [[outsiders]].\n\nLike paladins, divine champions could smite \"infidels\", be they the [[faithful]] of other gods or the [[Faithless]] who believed in none. Once a day, they could attack such a foe with the full force of their conviction. However, if the divine champion had a similar power as a former paladin or cleric, they could instead use that power one more time each day.\n\nFinally, a veteran divine champion could channel some of their deity's power into a divine wrath, boosting their prowess in battle considerably. They attacked with more skill and force; better resisted harmful effects; and ignored light wounds made by any weapon, manufactured or natural. The power that sustained them was sacred if the deity or the champion was good, or profane if the deity or the champion was evil.",
