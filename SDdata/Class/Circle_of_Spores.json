They held true that the ongoing cycle of life and death were integral to the balance of the natural world. To them, death was not an end, but rather a new beginning.\nUnlike other practitioners, Circle of Spores druids did not believe undead were abominations of nature, but rather a third alternative to life and death. Undead beings that sought to snuff out all life, or cheat a deserved death however, were considered abhorrent. For nature to be in balance, all three aspects of existence should be in approximate fluctuation with the other two.\nEarly in their studies, Circle of Spore druids could form a halo-like cloud of undetectable, necrotic spores that remained inert and harmless unless otherwise directed. As the druid wish, the cloud upon any creature that passed within  of their person. As they furthered their training, the spore cloud grew in lethality, if not size. By tapping into their inherent powers of transformation, they could form a symbiotic relationship with their spores, confer magical energy into their fungal cloud, and either increase its lethality or imbue the weapon they held with necrotic energy.\nMore experienced druids could use their halo of fungal spores to penetrate, and even animate a deceased corpse for up to an hours time. The corpse was transformed into a zombie-like creature,\nWhile in symbiosis with their spore cloud, druids could launch a tempest of their spores up to a range of  away. This expansive spore storm proved just as harmful as the cloud that surrounded the druid.\nOver time, the bodies of the most experienced Circle of Spores druids were transformed by their spore clouds. Their senses were heightened, and they could not become blinded or deafened, they were entirely fearless, and could not succumb to the effects of poison, whether mundane or magical in nature.\nThe connection that these druids felt with natural decay, along with the cycle of life and death, granted them access to spells outside the realm of divine magic. As they progressed in their order, Circle of Spore druids gained access to the following arcane spells chill touch, blindness or deafness, gentle repose, animate dead, gaseous form, blight, confusion, cloudkill, and contagion."
