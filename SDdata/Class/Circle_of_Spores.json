I wouldn't want it steering a corpse around and touching my stuff, though.|[[Tasha]].}}",
        "Culture": "These druids believed that mold and fungi held the power to transform decaying organic material into new, and strangely beautiful, forms of existence. They held true that the ongoing cycle of life and death were integral to the balance of the natural world. To them, death was not an end, but rather a new beginning.\n\nUnlike other practitioners, Circle of Spores druids did not believe [[undead]] were abominations of nature, but rather a third alternative to life and death. Undead beings that sought to snuff out all life, or cheat a deserved death however, were considered abhorrent. For nature to be in balance, all three aspects of existence should be in approximate fluctuation with the other two.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Spellcasting": "The connection that these druids felt with natural decay, along with the cycle of life and death, granted them access to spells outside the realm of [[divine magic]]. As they progressed in their order, Circle of Spore druids gained access to the following [[arcane spell]]s: ''[[chill touch]]'', ''[[blindness or deafness]]'', ''[[gentle repose]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[gaseous form]]'', ''[[blight]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[cloudkill]]'', and ''[[contagion]]''."
