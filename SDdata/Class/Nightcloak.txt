'''Nightcloaks''' were elite [[cleric]]s and [[ranger]]s who worshiped [[Shar]].

==Description==
Nightcloaks served Shar in a variety of capacities, such as helping her hide knowledge, searching for her enemies, and using the [[Shadow Weave]] to increase her power. Most nightcloaks possessed great charisma and intelligence, a powerful combination to manipulate ignorant nobles and commoners alike. Using their wit, they were able to bring about events in accordance with Shar's vision: the end of all existence.

==Abilities==
Nightcloaks were able to send silent messengers to other worshipers of Shar. As well as this, nightcloaks were able to modify another person's memories and manipulate what they remembered. Such rangers and clerics could summon [[shadow]]s, a kind of sentient creature linked to the [[Plane of Shadow]]. Like their summoners, they were loyal to Shar herself.
