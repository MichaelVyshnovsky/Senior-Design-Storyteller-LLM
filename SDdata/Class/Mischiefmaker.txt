Mischiefmakers were specialty priests devoted to Erevan Ilesere, the Trickster.
Mischiefmakers could be elves or half-elves, sprites, leprechauns, or pixies. The majority were green elves or moon elves.
They were skilled in the use of thieves cant and possessed limited thieving skills including the art of disguise. They were somewhat resistant to spells from the law sphere.
In addition to their normal spells, mischiefmakers could cast faerie fire, reduce, knock, change self, alter self, tree shape, chaos, invisibility, misdirection, nondetection, polymorph any object, and shapechange on a daily basis.
Mischiefmakers did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield. For armor they wore leather armor, padded armor, studded leather, or silenced elven chainmail.
