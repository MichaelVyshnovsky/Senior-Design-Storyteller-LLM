'''Mischiefmakers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Erevan Ilesere]], the Trickster.

==Culture==
Mischiefmakers could be [[elves]] or [[half-elves]], [[sprite]]s, [[leprechaun]]s, or [[pixie]]s. The majority were [[green elves]] or [[moon elves]].

==Abilities==
They were skilled in the use of [[thieves' cant]] and possessed limited thieving skills including the art of disguise. They were somewhat resistant to [[spell]]s from the [[law sphere]].

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, mischiefmakers could cast ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[reduce]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[tree shape]]'', ''[[Chaos (spell)|chaos]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', ''[[nondetection]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', and ''[[shapechange]]'' on a daily basis.

==Possessions==
Mischiefmakers did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield. For [[armor]] they wore [[leather armor]], [[padded armor]], [[studded leather]], or silenced [[elven chainmail]].
