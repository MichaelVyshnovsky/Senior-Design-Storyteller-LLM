However, Demeter is mentioned in ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' as having a good relationship with the [[Faer没n]]ian goddess [[Chauntea]]. For this reason, Demeter is documented in this article.",
        "Description": "[[File:Demeter symbol.jpg|thumb|273px|''The holy symbol of Demeter.'']]\nThis goddess generally appeared in the form of a beautiful, motherly woman that was draped in [[robe]]s whose colors varied depending upon the season. A lush green hue for the spring and summer, a golden hue for autumn, and a brown or black hue in the winter. Her [[avatar]] also sometimes took the form of a [[horse|mare]].",
        "Personality": "Demeter was a generally benevolent deity and almost never held grudges.",
        "Abilities": "Demeter had some resistance to harm from [[fire]]. She could cast at will the spells ''[[teleport without error]]'' and ''[[plane shift]]''. She was able to perceive anything within {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} of worshipers, holy sites, sacred objects, as well as any location where her name or one of her many titles had been spoken in the last hour. And could sense anything that affects cultivated crops the instant it happened.\n\nDemeter was capable of shapechanging at will, in a manner similar to the ''[[wild shape]]'' ability of [[druid]]s. She could take the form of all but gargantuan animals, including [[dire animal]]s, six times per day. While she could take the form of an [[elemental]] three times per day. At will she could also ''[[polymorph other]]s'' and create any type of weather for any length of time.\n\nDemeter could summon, control,\n\nHer avatar form was capable of casting [[spell]]s from the [[sphere]]s of [[animal sphere|animal]], [[elemental sphere|elemental]], [[healing sphere|healing]], and [[weather sphere|weather]].''[[Legends & Lore (2nd edition)]]'' states that she can cast spells from the illusion [[school of magic]], but ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' states that she is prohibited the use of such spells. Some of the many spells her avatar form was capable of casting included the following:\n\n:''[[antimagic field]]'', ''[[barkskin]]'', ''[[changestaff]]'', ''[[command plants]]'', ''[[control plants]]'', ''[[earthquake]]'', ''[[elemental swarm]]'' (as an [[earth]] spell only), ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[iron body]]'', ''[[magic stone]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', ''[[protection from elements]]'', ''[[repel wood]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'', ''[[sanctuary]]'', ''[[shambler]]'', ''[[shield other]]'', ''[[soften earth and stone]]'', ''[[spell immunity]]'', ''[[spell resistance]]'', ''[[spike stones]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[wall of stone]]'', and ''[[wall of thorns]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Demeter possessed a [[chariot]] that was pulled by two ancient [[green dragon]]s.\n\nShe wielded a [[longspear]] that was made of [[ash]] wood and carried a ''[[item enchantment|+2 enchantment]]'', though in later years this enchantment was enhanced to a ''+5''. Additionally, her spear's enchantment made it so that trees would sprout from any wound made by it.",
        "Realm": "Demeter lived in a rather common-looking cottage amidst an immense field of golden grain in the [[divine realm]] known as [[Olympus]].",
        "History": "Demeter was among the first six Olympians,\n\nDemeter went on to be the wife of Poseidon for a time, eventually parting ways as he took up residence in [[Aquallor]]. She then went on to marry Zeus and bore him a daughter named [[Persephone]]. This child would later be abducted into the Underworld by her brother Hades,{{Cite dragon/113/Welcome to Hades|26}} However, Persephone had already sealed her fate by partaking in the food of Hades's realm. Zeus would intervene in the matter, brokering a compromise that allowed Persephone{{Cite dragon/113/Welcome to Hades|26}} to spend part of her time in the underworld and part of her time in Olympus, what mortals would consider equivalent to six months.\n\nDemeter would go on to mourn the loss of Persephone every winter, during which time the crops of Olympian worshipers would not grow, and hold a longstanding grudge against Hades for what he had done.",
        "Relationships": "Throughout their time knowing each other, Demeter had always gotten on well with the [[Faer没nian pantheon|Faer没nian goddess]] [[Chauntea]].\n\nHer favored [[proxy]] was a [[human]] by the name of Triptolemus. He drove a chariot pulled by a pair of [[bronze dragon]]s and scattered grain seeds wherever he went."
