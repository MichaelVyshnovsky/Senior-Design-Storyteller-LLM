'''Chillbringers''' were specialty [[priest]]s of the [[Church of Auril]] devoted to the [[Frostmaiden]].<ref name="WaPotR-p67" >

==Activities==
These individuals spent their time focused on tasks related to winter and cold, ranging from conjuring harsh winter storms purely for Auril's glory, or guiding a group of [[adventurer]]s through a bitter cold forest.

==Culture==
Most chillbringers were quite reclusive. Their personalities were similar to snow—either representing something fun to play in, or something cold and life-threatening. Chillbringers could be emotionless individuals, stirred to emotion only when a storm was summoned.

==Abilities==
All chillbringers were expert guides in arctic lands. Chillbringers could summon snow storms provided the ambient temperature was below {{SI|30|F}}. The storm lasted for 1–12 hours and the snowfall was several inches per hour depending on the skill of the chillbringer. The winds of these storms prevented animals and creatures from flying, as well as the use of ranged weapons. All priests of Auril were immune to these effects.

A chillbringer could not turn [[undead]] like other priests. Given their close ties to the climate of the north, it was impossible for anyone born south of [[Neverwinter]] to become a chillbringer. A chillbringer traveling south of Neverwinter would lose all of their granted powers. These individuals were not allowed to use any [[spell]]s or [[magic item]]s that involved heat or fire.

==Possessions==
Chillbringers donned long white robes in favor of [[armor]]. These robes were cinched with a belt and [[ice bracer|wrist bracers made from real ice]]. These icy adornments were created during the [[Feast of the Moon]] and lasted until [[Greengrass]]. Only ice taken from the [[Great Glacier]] and crafted by a high-ranking clergy would be used in their creation. These bracers functioned like a [[magic item]] that bestowed protection and functioned like a ''[[ring of warmth]]'' for the chillbringer.

Most chillbringers wielded an [[ice dagger (weapon)|ice dagger]] or [[handaxe]] in combat. A chillbringer's ice dagger caused additional cold damage to their enemies.

==Relationships==
Most "right-thinking" folk were scared of chillbringers.
