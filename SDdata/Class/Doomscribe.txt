Doomscribes were specialty priests devoted to Jergal, the Lord of the End of Everything.
Only a small number of doomscribes existed and they never went adventuring unless at Jergals behest. They were experts in both necrology and the netherworld. When each doomscribe died Jergal determined whether or not they would continue to serve him in undeath as either a mummy or greater mummy.
When attempting to either turn or command undead, a doomscribe could double the number of undead affected. This power could be used three times per day. A doomscibes intimate knowledge of necrology allowed them to easily identify the various forms of undead, allowing them target their specific weaknesses during combat. Their knowledge of the planes provided a similar benefit when facing baatezu and tanarri. 
All spells cast by a doomscribe from either the law sphere or time sphere were twice as strong as normal in all aspects. Their connection with Jergal granted them resistance to energy draining attacks.
Doomscribes could cast the following spells on a daily basis depending on their skill feign death, ray of enfeeblement, mummy touch, skull watch, undead ward, animate dead, and energy drain. They could also cast age creature twice per day, and enervation three times per day.
Doomscribes could wear any type of armor available to them and could wield the bludgeoning weapon of their choice in combat.
