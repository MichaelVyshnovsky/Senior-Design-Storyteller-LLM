        "mainbody": "A '''scout''' was an [[adventurer]] similar to a [[rogue]] or [[ranger]], preferring to stay hidden and attack from a distance rather than up close and personal.",
        "Activities": "They had varying roles, from leading an army through unknown terrain to working as a mercenary going solo to learn terrain for the payer. Usually they wore [[leather armor]], as they relied more on speed and agility to outmaneuver an opponent.",
        "Tactics": "A scout often used light melee weapons, such as [[dagger]]s and [[shortsword]]s, and a small ranged weapon, like a [[shortbow]] or [[hand crossbow]]. They fought dirty, preferring to end the fight quick and were generally they are proficient in stealth and lock-picking."
