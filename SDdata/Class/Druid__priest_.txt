'''Druids''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Shiallia]], the Dancer in the Glades.

==Culture==
The druids of Shiallia were always female [[half-elves]], [[gold elves]], [[moon elves]], [[wild elves]], or [[human]]s.

==Abilities==
These individuals were skilled in wilderness survival and often spoke the languages of sylvan races such as [[dryad]]s, [[korred]]s, [[satyr]]s, [[sylph]]s, [[treant]]s, and [[unicorn]]s.

They could not cast the ''[[raise dead]]'' or ''[[resurrection]]'' [[spell]]s nor any spell from the [[necromantic sphere]].

==Possessions==
Druids wielded a variety of weapons depending on their personal preference including [[club]]s, [[sickle]]s, [[dart]]s, [[sling]]s, [[spear]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[quarterstaves]], and [[scimitar]]s. The heaviest [[armor]] they wore was [[padded armor]] and some chose to carry a [[shield]] as well.
