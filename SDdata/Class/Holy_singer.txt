'''Holy singers''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Oghma]] who specialized in arbitration and peacekeeping activities through song, hoping the harmony in their voices brought harmony to those around them.<ref name="WaPotR-p99" >

==Activities==
A holy singer would usually choose to sing rather than speak.

==Culture==
All holy singers were either [[human]]s, [[elf|elves]], or [[half-elves]]. They were quite humble, though they sometimes appeared to be arrogant to others. Still, a holy singer's reputation often preceded them in a positive way.

==Abilities==
Holy singers used their voice to [[turn undead]] through song. Likewise, they could sing to create a ''[[protection from evil, 10' radius]]'' sphere as well. A holy singer could forgo the need for a [[somatic component]] by singing, but this did increase the casting time by a small amount.

Any attack, magical or otherwise, against a holy singer's voice or ability to speak often left them ''[[Confusion|confused]]''.

==Possessions==
The attire of a holy singer was a white tunic and pants and a black [[gold]]-trimmed vest. They also wore a crimson hat complete with a feather.
