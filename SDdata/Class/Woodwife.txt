Woodwives were specialty priests devoted to Shiallia, the Daughter of the High Forest.
Woodwives were always female humans, gold elves, moon elves, wild elves, halflings, half-elves, forest gnomes, green elves, or korreds.
Similar to a paladin, a woodwife could heal wounds by laying her hands on someone. This could be done three times per day. All woodwives could speak with animals and plants at will. They had access to a variety of spell-like abilities including entangle, goodberry, animal summoning I, call woodland beings, plant growth, animal summoning II, commune with nature, animal summoning III, conjure animals, fire seeds, and heal. Each of these abilities could be used once per day.
These individuals were skilled in wilderness survival and often spoke the languages of sylvan races such as dryads, korreds, satyrs, sylphs, treants, and unicorns.
Most woodwives wore padded armor and carried a wooden shield. They wielded a variety of weapons depending on their personal preference including clubs, sickles, darts, slings, spears, daggers, quarterstaves, and nets. Woodwives also carried a strange magic item called a korred rope made from their own hair.
