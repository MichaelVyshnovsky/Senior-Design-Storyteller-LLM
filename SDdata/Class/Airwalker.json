        "mainbody": "'''Airwalkers''' were free-spirited specialty priests devoted to [[Akadi]], the Lady of the Winds.",
        "Activities": "In addition to [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s, [[kenku]]s and [[aarakocra]] could also become airwalkers.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to their normal assortment of [[divine magic]] [[spell]]s, airwalkers could also cast [[wizard]] spells from the [[elemental air]] school. They prayed for these wizard spells just like they did for their other spells.\n\nAirwalkers had an easier time avoiding the brunt of any harmful effects from airborne weather, air spells, breath weapons, or poisonous clouds. Akadi protected these individuals from falling by allowing them to ''[[feather fall]]'' at will. Airwalkers gained magical powers that could be used once per day as they progressed including ''[[wraithform]], [[conjure air elemental]], [[fly]]'', and ''[[cloudkill]]''. Once per tenday an airwalker could summon an incredibly powerful [[air elemental]]. Particularly powerful airwalkers were able to move through the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] without the need for food or water. Airwalkers working together were capable of summoning and controlling a stronger air elemental that would otherwise have been beyond their control if summoned alone.",
        "Possessions": "Airwalkers could wield any single melee weapon of their choosing. Any additional weapons wielded by them were missile weapons. The heaviest [[armor]] worn by an airwalker was [[chainmail]] and they sometimes carried a [[shield]]. Airwalkers were forbidden from using any [[magic item]]s with [[earth]]-based effects."
