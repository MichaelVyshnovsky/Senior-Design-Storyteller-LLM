==(2e) in category names?==
In several instances we have categories for kits both with and without the addition of "(2e)", e. g. [[:Category:Farisan]] and [[:Category:Farisan (2e)]]. Do we really need both? Actually, do we need the added "(2e)" at all, or should we have [[:Category:Mamluks]] only instead of [[:Category:Mamluks (2e)]]? As far as I know, kits only exist in 2nd Edition. ([[:Category:Sorcerers (2e)]] is an exception, as sorcerer was the name of a kit in 2nd Edition, but [[Sorcerer]] is a class in 3rd and higher edition.)

:Those categories are supposed to be automatically generated by the {{tl|Class table}} template, and yes, they should have the edition in the name. If they don't, then something is wrong. Apparently, the problem with "Farisan" is that the kit/class is called "Faris" and the plural is not "Fariss", (see [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]] where it generated [[:Category:Fariss (2e)]]). This is easily fixed, I just didn't notice it had happened and nobody brought it to my attention until now. 
:We are treating 2nd edition kits as analogous to 3rd edition prestige classes and 4th edition paragon paths. There should be a non-edition specific article and category (e.g., [[Morninglord]] and [[:Category:Morninglords]]) and an edition-specific class category (e.g., [[:Category:Morninglords (3e)]], [[:Category:Morninglords (4e)]]) for every class. Individuals are placed in these as they apply and also a level-based category, if known (e.g., [[:Category:Morninglords of 3rd level (3e)]]). The edition-specific categories should always be generated by {{tl|Class table}} (if possible). Does that help? &mdash;[[User:Moviesign|Moviesign]] ([[User talk:Moviesign|talk]]) 19:50, May 23, 2015 (UTC)

:Okay, someone with the proper references will probably have to do this, or at least answer some questions. Is Farisan a title or a kit/class, or both? We have to be careful when distinguishing titles and occupations from PC classes. Are they Fighter kits or Warrior kits? It makes a difference for category purposes. Likewise, are they Priests kits or Cleric kits? Rogue, Thief, or Bard kits? When all is said and done, [[:Category:Kits]] should look just like [[:Category:Prestige classes]] in content and have subcategories that are analogous. [[:Category:Corsairs (2e)]] looks right, except for maybe the Warrior/Fighter question. When you get down to the level-based categories, there should be only two categories, and it should be sorted by the level number, like 08 or 14 as in [[:Category:Corsairs of 8th level (2e)]] and [[:Category:Corsairs of 14th level (2e)]].

::According to ''[[Arabian Adventures]]'', the faris is a kit (with a well-defined role). It might be used as a title, too, but the source does not clearly say so.<br>
::All warrior kits from ''Arabian Adventures'' really are for warriors, not only fighters. The "priest kits" there (so far we have the ethoists and pragmatists) are really all cleric kits only (except the outland priest). How is this done? Should there be a sub-category [[:Category:Cleric kits]] within [[:Category:Priest kits]]? (Actually, are priest kits out there in the sense that they are available for clerics, druids and specialty priests, all?) The situation for rogues is mixed. [[Barber]]s may be thieves or bards. So do we need [[:Category:Rogue kits]] here, or do we just add [[:Category:Bard kits]] to [[:Category:Barbers (2e)]]?

:::I think we should just make a decision to categorize them by Priest, Warrior, Wizard, and Rogue kits and not use Thief, Bard, Cleric, or Fighter, etc. Kits are variations on a theme and I don't think we need to quibble about where to draw the line between a Thief and a Bard, or a Fighter and a Ranger, let's just go with the broader categories. There are plenty of other kits that could be documented, like from [[The Complete Priest's Handbook]] and others from that series. I am trying to model the [[:Category:Kits]] category tree after what we've done for [[:Category:Prestige classes]] with the addition that we put [[:Category:Mamluks (2e)]] as a subclass of [[:Category:Warriors (2e)]], for example. If 5th edition brings back the concept of kits, then we won't have to rearrange our categories, we'll just add (5e) cats to [[:Category:Kits]]. &mdash;[[User:Moviesign|Moviesign]] ([[User talk:Moviesign|talk]]) 13:41, May 26, 2015 (UTC)

::::Sounds good to me. [[User:Daranios|Daranios]] ([[User talk:Daranios|talk]]) 19:36, May 26, 2015 (UTC)

Okay, I have to state something... all the ''Land of Fate'' character statblocks have an inhabitants' class, such as [[Nasir el-Mamadin]] is a [[fighter]]... and while it does say he is a [[mamluk]]... I feel it is more important that he is a fighter for our category system... a kit feels more like the 5e archetypes... or our occupation line in the Person infobox... 3e Prestige classes are an actual separate class, while kits are just flavor... I propose we add a '''Kit/Archetype/Background''' line to the Person infobox... and just make Class level categories... of course, keep the kit categories, like [[:Category:Mamluks]], but do not have levels... 
So Nasir is a 10th level Fighter who would also have the mamluk category... a good example is in 5e, a fighter can be a Champion or Battlemaster... we should not have Battlemasters of 12th level, because these archetypes really only add flair to the Fighter class... my two cents :) - [[User:Darkwynters|Darkwynters]] ([[User talk:Darkwynters|talk]]) 23:21, May 26, 2015 (UTC)

:So you want to take "Mamluk" ''et. al.'' out of the {{tl|Class table}} and replace it with the basic class? That's okay with me, but they did go to the trouble of making three-letter abbreviations for some of these kits, treating them like a class, didn't they? Oh well, I think it would be better to use Fighter for the class, just for sorting and listing purposes if nothing else. I'm not sure what to call the additional field for the {{tl|Person}} template. The archetype of Mamluk would be Fighter, right? Any suggestions on what to call it that would work across editions? How about "Flavor", "Variation", or "Variant"? Maybe "Subclass"? I think "Build" has a different meaning to 4th edition players (?) Thoughts anyone? &mdash;[[User:Moviesign|Moviesign]] ([[User talk:Moviesign|talk]]) 13:19, May 27, 2015 (UTC)

::Hey guys, I'm late to the party but just noticed this talk page. All of these kits I'm adding are for Al-Qadim, which was 2E only I believe. So if there aren't any [[Corsair]]s for 3E,4E, etc then maybe removing the 2E from the kit title/cat is a viable option. Personally I'd prefere to have all these Zakharan characters classified by their kit and just treat it a their class.  [[Jayani al-Jasir]] would be a corsair not a fighter and so on and so forth. Just let me know what you guys want to do and I'll adapt accordingly. ;) [[User:Artemaz|Artemas]] ([[User talk:Artemaz|talk]]) 13:33, May 27, 2015 (UTC)

:I think I agree with [[User:Artemaz|Artemas]]. To me, kits are like wizard specializations in 3e. Everyone knows that a necromancer is a kind of wizard, but a lot of official products list them as Nec, not as Wiz. 2e sourcebooks did this too. Like [[User:Moviesign|Moviesign]] said, if there are abbreviations for these things, that indicates that they be treated like classes. We can script it so that all necromancers get categorized as wizards and so that all mamluks get categorized as fighters. ~ ''[[User:Lhynard|Lhynard]]'' ([[User talk:Lhynard|talk]]) 18:34, May 27, 2015 (UTC)

::At the moment I rather tend towards  [[User:Darkwynters|Darkwynters]]' variant (whatever the solution in detail). E.g. [[Aban al-Hadhar]] is at the moment classified as a barber of 7th level, but that does not tell us if he is a thief or bard, which rulewise would probably have more consequences than the barber kit. It would be fine with me if we just added [[:Category:Thieves]] (which he is), but I would prefer to put in thief of 7th level and somehow add that he is the barber variant of a thief. In the same vein we might run into trouble with the scripting suggested by [[User:Lhynard|Lhynard]], as all mamluks are warriors, but might be paladins or rangers instead of fighters.

:::Is there a way to change the template lines so a person who is a 7th level thief of the barber kit would show up as "Thief (Barber) 7th Level?" Before I had Thief 7 and Barber 7 which made it look like the character actually had 14 levels. [[User:Artemaz|Artemas]] ([[User talk:Artemaz|talk]]) 20:09, May 27, 2015 (UTC)

::::No, we don't want to go changing the templates to handle special cases or create non-standard categories, we just need to decide on the way we want to handle kits. I want to keep the [[:Category:Thieves of 7th level (2e)]] category so that Zakharan NPC don't get shunted off to their own corner of the category tree, and the {{tl|Class table}} does that just fine. We just need to add one or two additional categories, like [[:Category:Barbers]] and [[:Category:Barbers (2e)]] and then you can find all the Barbers, if that's what you want, and you can use {{tl|Category intersection}} to find all  thieves who are 7th level and also barbers, ''etc.'' That's my idea, anyway. &mdash;[[User:Moviesign|Moviesign]] ([[User talk:Moviesign|talk]]) 20:39, May 27, 2015 (UTC)

::::Ah, I did not realize that a kit could apply to two (or more) classes like that. A Nec is always a Wiz, but if a barber can be a thief ''or'' a bard, that is a problem. In that case, I change my vote.

::::However, a new param for the infobox won't fix this, because the issue is within {{Tl|class table}}.

::::~ ''[[User:Lhynard|Lhynard]]'' ([[User talk:Lhynard|talk]]) 20:41, May 27, 2015 (UTC)

:::::Also, in the game stats... these characters have a class and a kit... the sourcebook states [[Nasir el-Mamadin]] IS a fighter... personally, I think keep the class table as is... keep the class by level as is and just add a kit line like Lhyn's ethnic line or the occupation line in the Person infobox... then add a category, such as Mamluk... or Mamluk (kit) - [[User:Darkwynters|Darkwynters]] ([[User talk:Darkwynters|talk]]) 21:28, May 27, 2015 (UTC)

::::::Would it be possible to add a named param to the {{Tl|Class table}} template such as <code>kit1</code>, which would format the table such that the setting would appear in parentheses after the class? For example:
