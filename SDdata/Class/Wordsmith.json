        "mainbody": "Wordsmiths were specialty priests of the Church of Deneir who served as translators, teachers, scribes, and librarians throughout Faer√ªn.\nWordsmiths spent a great amount of their time performing charity work.\nWordsmiths were highly intelligent and educated individuals but did not appear to be snobbish.\nMost wordsmiths were fluent in at least three languages. Their skill with languages was so polished that it was difficult to tell which language was the wordsmiths native tongue. Wordsmiths were also adept at identifying magical writings such as glyphs and other symbols.\nWordsmiths were not able to turn undead.\nWordsmiths always wore their holy writing kit, which was a leather belt pouch outfited with ink, parchment, and quills. They usually wore a simple tan and white tunic, a golden circlet, and a crimson cloak. Wordsmiths avoided combat so never wore armor. If they bothered to carry a weapon it was usually something small and inconspicious."
