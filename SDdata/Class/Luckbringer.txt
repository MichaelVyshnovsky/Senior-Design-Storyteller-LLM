'''Luckbringers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Tymora]], the Lady of Luck.

==Culture==
These specialty priests were both male and female and primarily [[halfling]]s, though members of any race could become luckbringers.

==Abilities==
They were able to use Tymora's power to increase their luck and chances for a favorable result in a single situation on a daily basis. In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, holy champions could cast ''[[moment]]'', ''[[favor of Tymora]]'', ''[[feat]]'', ''[[probability control]]'', ''[[lower resistance]]'', and ''[[luckbolt]]'' once per day. Once per tenday they could ask Tymora for ''[[divine inspiration]]''.

==Possessions==
Luckbringers only wielded bludgeoning weapons. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
