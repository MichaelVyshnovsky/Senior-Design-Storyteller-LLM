Rillifane Rallathil (Pronounce|RILL|ih|fayne|_|RALL|uh|thihl|refs=
The Yuir elves worshiped a giant treant called Relkath of the Infinite Branches, which was purported to be an aspect of Rillifane Rallathil.

The Leaflord was friendly with the fellow deities of Seldarine, and many of sylvan and faerie deities, in particular Eldath, Mielikki, Silvanus, Oberon, and Titania, as well as Baervan Wildwanderer, Cyrrollalee, Eilistraee, Emmantiensien, Sheela Peryroyl, Skerrit, Osiris, Verenestra and various Animal Lords. He was opposed to Malar, Talos and the Dark Seldarine.
Khalreshaar, an interloper goddess in the elven pantheon, aspect of Mielikki serves Fillifan Rallathil under this aspect.
Though not a temple, Rillifanes Grove in Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet served as a sacred place for wood and wild elves to conduct marriages, funerals, or other ceremonies, as well as a place used to contact the Seldarine by moon and sun elf priests.
* Aerilaya, a green elf druid.
* Eira, a Chosen of Rillifane.
When the SyTelQuessir settled in the Yuirwood, the Seldarine merged with the ancient gods of the Yuir, taking them on as aspects. Magnar the Bear and Relkath of the Infinite Branches became a part of the Leaflord. As a result of these changes, over the centuries since, the Wild One once more become more primordial in spirit.
