'''Raumathari battlemages''' were the elite war-minded [[spellcaster]]s of ancient [[Raumathar]], an empire that rose and fell over a millennium before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Culture==
These battlemages considered themselves to be the enemies of ancient [[Narfell]] and the [[demon]]ic forces with which they cavorted.

==Abilities==
All battlemages were required to [[Attunement|attune]] themself to a single [[sword]], using it as a focus rather than some other implement. This [[ritual]] took three days to perform, and required [[material component]]s upwards of 1,000 [[gp]] in value.

This extra effort was rewarded with a unique power. Raumathari battlemages could in effect channel certain memorized spells through their sword as they struck down foes in battle. A creature struck by the weapon was also struck by the effects of the channeled spell, so long as they did not resist the effects.

They could also apply [[metamagic]] effects to their spells at a rapid pace, without extending the duration of a spell's casting time.

==History==
In the final conflict between Raumathar and Narfell, the battlemages led the efforts to destroy the Narfelli capital of [[Val-Murthag]].

There were few practitioners of Raumathari battlemagic in the millennia following the collapse of the great eastern empire.
