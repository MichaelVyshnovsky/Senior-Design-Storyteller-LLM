        "mainbody": "'''Elven high mages''', or '''selu'taar''' in the [[elven language]], were among some of the most passionate [[mage]]s from among the [[elven]] species, whose zeal was viewed by others as bordering on obsession. They saw the uncovering of secrets of [[elven high magic]] as the culmination of their career, and ultimately their purpose on [[Toril]], and fiercely guarded their esoteric knowledge and arcane lore.",
        "Members": "As of the 1370's DR, there were less than a dozen elves that knew where the repository of knowledge regarding high magic was even located, let alone how to practice the [[epic magic]].\n\nAt least three elven high mages lived in [[Evereska]] around that time, though one was killed by the [[phaerimm]] in [[1371 DR]].",
        "Requirements": "[[Wizard]]s or [[sorcerer]]s could become high mages, but under normal circumstances only elven casters were capable of casting high magic. There were two methods to becoming a High Mage. The first method was to petition the few remaining councils of high mages who resided in various elven strongholds or cities. If the petitioner was accepted, he or she could begin the study of High Magic through conventional means under the guidance and direction of the council. The second method was to inherit a ''[[Selu'Kiira]]'' and be taught high magic from the stone, provided they meet the stone's requirements and that it possessed such knowledge. Elves under the age of 300 generally weren't permitted to attain the rank of high mage. It was assumed that regardless of skill that they weren't experienced enough to possess such power.\n\nNormally it was only possible to cast true high magic spells with a group of high mages. Although some spells such as those that made changes, added to, or took away certain functions of a ''[[mythal]]'' were possible provided the requisite knowledge was held. It was however possible for a single high mage to cast true high magic spells alone. In order to do so it was necessary for the caster to become something more than mortal, such as the case of the [[daemonfey]] sorceress [[Sarya Dlardrageth]]. It may have been possible for other [[planetouched]] creatures to yield the same effect but the only races known to have been joined were the [[demon]]s and [[celestial]]s.{{Page needed}}",
        "Abilities": "[[Image:ElvenHighMage.jpg|right|''An [[elven]] high mage''|225px|]]\n{{Quote|I see your high mages have kept their knowledge to themselves. Perhaps I should honor their wisdom until I know why.|[[Melegaunt Tanthul]], to an elf from [[Evereska]].}}\n\nThe elven high mages were masters of creating the elven magic of ''Mythals'' which could grow in power to envelop and protect entire cities.\n\nThey were capable of casting spells with the power to change the [[Weave]] itself and the physical world of [[Toril]]. Some uses of high magic extended from [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s efforts to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]], as [[Rhymanthiin]], the Hidden City of Hope.\n\nElven high mages could readily communicate with others by means of the ritual known as ''[[A message on Birds' Wings to Silver|Vuorl'Kyshuf]]''.",
        "History": "The [[Dark Disaster]] that transformed the realm of Miyeritar into the [[High Moor]] in {{Yearlink|-10500}} was actually caused by elven high mages from [[Aryvandaar]].<ref name=GHotR-p15\">\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-255}}, the elven high mages [[Nikerymath]] conjured an enormous tidal wave to wash over the twelve cities of [[Jhaamdath]], essentially leveling the empire in one fell swoop. The tremendous magical feat reshaped the face of [[Faer√ªn]], transforming the [[Bay of Jhaamdath]] into the the much larger [[Vilhon Reach]] as it later came to be known.<ref name=GHotR-p51\">\n\n[[Q'arlynd Melarn]] and the other masters of the [[College of Ancient Arcana]] once cast a spell that wiped the name and memory of the [[drow]] [[Dark Seldarine|goddess]] [[Kiaransalee]] from every being on every [[plane of existence]] causing her untimely death.{{Page needed}} The same group also cast a spell that turned all non[[Lolth|-Lolth]] worshiping Drow without demon tainted blood back into brown skinned Dark Elves. Master Melarn established the school of Ancient Arcana to bring the knowledge back into the hands of Dark Elves.",
        "Notable Elven High Mages": "* [[Gervas Imesfor]], a [[gold elf]] lord of Everska that remained in the city as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n* [[Lyrna Fathomlin]], a high mage of Miyeritar that was assimilated by the [[sharn]].<ref name=GHotR-p15\" />\n* [[Tyvollus Aluviirsan]], the high mage of Cormanthyr that transformed one of the sets of the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' into the ''[[Quess'Ar'Teranthvar]]''."
