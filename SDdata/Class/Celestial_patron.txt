A '''celestial patron''' was one possible sponsor for a [[warlock]]. If a bargain was made between a warlock and a being from the [[Upper Planes]], such as an [[empyrean]], [[ki-rin]], [[solar]], [[unicorn]], or some other resident of the realms of [[good]], the warlock's patron gave them access to certain powers, that included a suite of [[spell]]s. Warlocks of such patrons were recorded to exist by the crime lord and [[beholder]], [[Xanathar]].

==Culture==
These individuals were often quite successful at establishing trust between different parties.

==Abilities==
Starting off, beginner warlocks who had chosen a celestial sponsor would gain two [[cantrip]]s: ''[[light]]'' and ''[[sacred flame]]''. They were also able to heal their allies' wounds, and should they become experienced enough, they could resist radiant damage. These warlocks would also find themselves having an additional pool of health after they had rested, and may have also been able to resist death from crucial blows.

Novice warlocks of such a pact could cast ''[[cure wounds]]'', ''[[guiding bolt]]'', ''[[flaming sphere]]'', and ''[[lesser restoration]]''. The Celestial would grant both ''[[daylight]]'' and ''[[revivify]]'' to experienced spellcasters. Those that were very skilled and were still sponsored by their patron would gain access to ''[[guardian of faith]]'' and ''[[wall of fire]]'', as well as ''[[flame strike]]'' and ''[[greater restoration]]''.
