Fetishists were Azuposi rogues who also used a special form of animal magic called fetish magic that granted them access to specific types of priest spells.
Fetishists dealt with spirits on a regular basis. They helped the hunters of their village and protected their community from dangerous roaming wild animals.
A fetishist was a well-respected member of their Azuposi community, though they lacked the status of true priests.
They were usually quite skilled with training, handling, and mimicking animals.
They wielded clubs, slings, daggers, or short bows.
