Revered mothers were specialty priestesses devoted to Hathor, the Dancer of Fortune within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
These holy women often delivered newborns, practically ensuring that zero life-threatening mishaps for the mother or child would occur during the process. Wealthy individuals were expected to pay for these services, but revered mothers aided those in need for free.
These individuals were always human women of Mulhorandi descent. They were "revered" because of their wisdom and knowledge.
Revered mothers could used a number of powers on a daily basis including charm person or mammal, music of the spheres, divination, commune, consequence, charm monster, restore youth, and restoration. They could remove or dispel charms by touch as well. They could bestow a curse upon anyone threatening a pregnant woman or child.
Revered mothers carried a variety of weapons including a sling, clubs, daggers, flails, and staves. Their preferred armor was padded, chainmail, leather armor, studded leather, and they sometimes carried a shield.
