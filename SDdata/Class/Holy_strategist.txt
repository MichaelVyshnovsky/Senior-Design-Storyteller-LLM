Holy strategists were specialty priests devoted to the Red Knight, the Lady of Strategy.
A holy strategists life revolved around warfare. They often served as respected military commanders or instructors at war colleges.
These speciality priests excelled when using spells from the war sphere and travelers sphere. The effects of spells cast from these spheres were doubled. They also found it easier to see through illusions.
They gained a number of abilities as they progressed through the ranks including clairaudience/clairvoyance, divination, consequence, hallucinatory terrain, and mass invisibility. These powers could be used once per day.
They could cast wizard spells when using scrolls.
A holy strategists familiarity with weaponry allowed them to execute more attacks during combat than a typical priest. They nearly rivaled a fighter in their proficient use of weapons.
Holy strategists could carry any weapon they desired for combat. They were not restricted in the type of armor they wore, but most preferred plate mail, field plate, or full plate armor.
A holy strategist almost always rode an exquisite steed. Though their mount could certainly be a well-trained horse, other options included pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, tigers, etc.
