        "Description": "Raxivort resembled a xvart of great hideousness (even for a xvart). His skin was bright blue and his eyes glowed with orange light. Raxivort's [[avatar]] could also take the form of a [[rat]],",
        "Possessions": "He typically wore [[silk]]en garments over blue [[chainmail]], all of which shimmered as if aflame. He carried small, bladed weapons such as knives and [[dagger]]s, as well as a small unique [[falchion]], the ''[[Azure Razor]]''.",
        "History": "Before his demigod status, Raxivort was a treasurer for [[Graz'zt]]. He eventually betrayed him by stealing some of this treasure and fleeing to the [[material plane]]. One of the items he stole was the [[Infinity Spindle]], a crystal shard from the early times of the multiverse that could transform creatures into gods.\n\nIn order to hide his whereabouts while on the prime plane, Raxivort spawned creatures that were his exact physical duplicate. This was the creation of the beings known as xvarts.\n\nOne of his more direct actions against Graz'zt included causing a massive rat infestation in [[Fogtown]], [[Zelatar]]'s neighborhood on the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layers 45–47: Azzagrat|45{{th}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]], and the [[Queen's Causeway]], the undermarket connecting Fogtown to [[Gallenghast]], Zelatar's neighbourhood on the 46{{th}} layer of the Abyss. This infestation made life there difficult and extended to practically every building and was hard to combat. The Night Flutterer had the rats under his control and could direct them as he wished.",
        "Realm": "After leaving the Abyss, Raxivort forged a realm known as the [[Black Sewers]] in [[Pandesmos]], the top layer of [[Pandemonium]]."
