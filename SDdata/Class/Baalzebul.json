        "Description": "Triel was once renowned as among one of the most beauteous denizens of [[Celestia]] but was physically altered after his corruption. His new form was that of a {{SI|12|ft}} tall humanoid with shimmering, sable skin and the jittering, compound eyes of a fly. Still [[angel]]ically stunning even after his fall from grace, Asmodeus put a curse upon him as punishment for a later crime, forcing him into an even more demeaning form.\n\n[[Image:Baalzebul.jpg||thumb|left|250px|An aspect of Baalzebul]]\n\nThe former [[celestial]]'s mutated form was that of a {{SI|25|ft}} tall [[slug]],{{Cite web|url=http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20070216a|title=Fiendish Codex II Fiendish Aspects|accessdate=2020-04-03|author=[[Robert Wiese]]|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|date=2007-02-16}} The Lord of the Flies was constantly surrounded by swarms of the buzzing, scuttling creatures that earned him his title. His body glistened with mucus and thanks to his curse, fecal matter and other rancid filth manifested in piles wherever he went, resulting in his notoriously noxious stench. His deformed arms rested at his front and were more comparable to prehensile tails in functionality. Replacing his handsome visage was a gross, human-like face with torpid lips, incapable of properly pronouncing words without a slimy, wet lisp.\n\nHowever, even when reduced to such an unsightly state, faint glimpses of the Slug Archduke's previously glorious appearance could still be made out.",
        "Personality": "Of Baalzebul's numerous flaws, his most crippling was his perfectionist extremism. His unfiltered dedication to achieving physical flawlessness and greater dominion was what caused his initial fall from the Seven Heavens, as such callous ambition was more befitting of a devil. Seemingly incapable of realizing when he had gone too far, his utter arrogance led him to undermine his own plans by overreaching. He might have even been able to defeat his rival [[Mephistopheles]] if in his overconfident scheming he didn't also aim to defeat Asmodeus, causing him to fall even further than before.\n\nBaalzebul made an effort to seem calm on the surface, often withholding his true feelings from others.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|22-26}} but after being cursed he became neglectful and miserable himself. Often times he ignored his depressing duties in favor of plotting revenge and fantasizing about regaining his original, Triel form.\n\n{{Fq\n| width  = 300px\n| source = Baalzebul\n| text   = Your gods have fled this place. The spirits of the world no longer walk your streets. Your mages’ spells have failed you. In your hour of need, I alone hear your pleas.\n}}\n\nDespite his flaws, Baalzebul was still dangerously cunning and charismatic. If not for the interference of [[Geryon]], he might have not only been able to best Mephistopheles, but even oust Asmodeus himself. Even when trapped in his inarticulate, slug-like form, he was still the Lord of the Lies, whose every deception and false statement was made with ease. He was not to be mistaken as a pathological liar as he told each untruth with a purpose in mind and indeed managed to keep a hold on his layer for several millennia without lying, at least to other devils.",
        "Powers": "Various spell-like abilities were at Baalzebul's command, such as the power to manipulate and create light and flames, [[Create greater undead|create powerful undead]], enchant and mentally command others, turn [[invisibility|invisible]] and use various types of [[divination]] magic. His more powerful abilities let him create [[symbol of pain|symbols of pain]] and [[symbol of insanity|insanity]], speak ''[[unholy word]]s'' and even use ''[[wish]]''. He could choose to summon [[barbazu]]s, [[erinyes]], [[gelugon]]s or [[pit fiend]]s but particularly [[cornugon]]s. Normally however, Baalzebul's spells were his fallback plan used when his other supernatural powers, proved unsuccessful at dealing with his enemies.\n\nWhen in his slug form, Baalzebul's first tactic was normally to belch out gargantuan clouds of flesh-devouring flies, an ability he had to wait a few dozen seconds to reuse. Although the flies normally dispersed after being spewed, he could cause them to swarm and envelop his form if he so desired for about a minute, protecting him from harm as the flies didn't attack his grotesque mass. The flies could be blown away by a strong ''[[gust of wind]]'', but even without them shielding him, Baalzebul's stench was so putrid that simply trying to get anywhere close to him was sickening. Despite being more sluggish than he once was, he was able to burrow underground and his adhesive slime-coated form was adept at scaling surfaces.\n\nHis arms were so feeble that he normally relied on his servitors to perform tasks like turning pages, opening doors and feeding him, but they served a purpose in combat besides wielding weapons. Blood, muscle and sinew quickly withered away with even the slightest touch from the Slug Archduke's atrophied limbs, although immortals like devils or [[demon]]s were immune to the effect. Like an actual slug however, limbs and body parts removed from Baalzebul simply grew back, although his regeneration was supernaturally fast, allowing him to regrow body parts in a few minutes and reattach severed limbs. His regenerative powers were less effective when he was harmed with good-aligned spells and [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]] weapons.\n\nAlthough many of his powers were a result of his slug form, Baalzebul possessed some before his metamorphosis, such as the ability to fly or ''[[shapechange]]''. Another was his direct gaze, which combined the powers of a ''[[fear]]'' and ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'' spell to leave his victims trembling in terror even after he stopped staring at them. His slug form shared his gaze, but couldn't use it properly when surrounded by flies.\n\nAfter he was restored to his humanoid form, Baalzebul retained his ability to ''shapechange''. He was capable of transforming into a [[giant fly]] or a swam of fist-sized flies, similar to those he could previously spew.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-22/Baalzebul's post-slug form}}",

        "Realm": {
            "Malagard": "The personal residence of Baalzebul was the fortress city of Malagard. Malagard was so vast that not even its lord knew all of its many miles of passages and rooms. Even as it was being constructed however, Baalzebul's servants knew that while it was without doubt his greatest city, he would end up declaring it unsatisfactory and force them to start again, with some even sabotaging their own work to delay the inevitable. Sure enough, Malagard became a symbol of sloth and nihilistic ruin as it slowly crumbled and fell into the surrounding dirt while the poorly kept roads became rivers of trash. Even the occasional repairing spree quickly ended, and every day the crushing defeatism weighed more upon the devil denizen, with even the incessant Baalzebul eventually giving up preventing its demise.\n\nIn the center of Malagard was the Palace of Filth, Baalzebul's castle that was turned into a building-shaped pile of amorphous [[dung]] at the same time that Baalzebul was cursed and ordered by Asmodeus to be filled with even more filth. Baalzebul had to hollow the interior himself to create corridors and rooms and periodically reinforced slumping ones with the ooze from his bloated body, lest they collapse on his servants. The palace was practically indistinguishable from the surrounding city and inhabited by [[otyugh]]s and [[ghargatula]]s, the former of which were ignored as they disposed of the feces and the latter of which were Baalzebul's personal guards."
        },
        "Activities": "After his mortifying experience as a slug, Baalzebul limited his open plotting to the Lord of the Eighth and focused his energies on sneaking more spies into Asmodeus's court while also appealing to him, primarily by making his rivals look incompetent by comparison. The curses inflicted on him by his master effectively neutralized his ability to properly forge alliances with his peers, so much of his time was spent completing his actual duties as an archduke and overseeing the soul-driven bureaucracy of his layer. Edicts, policies, treatises and other documents were kept in the underground archival labyrinth that Maladomini had made after his defeat, protected by traps, devils and confounding classification systems.\n\nHe jealously guarded all the power and secrets he could from the other archdevils, particularly Asmodeus and Mephistopheles, in order to eventually enact his take over of Hell,{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|9}}",
        "Relationships": {
            "Dukes": "Baalzebul servants included his generals [[Abigor]], [[Bileth]], and [[Zepar]]. The authoritarian Marshal of Maladomini, [[Barbatos]], was never known to have displayed any personal ambitions of true feelings, but the shrewd authoritarian had managed to win Baalzebul's respect and limited trust. There was also [[Neabaz]], the Herald of Lies, a polite bringer of Baalzebul's mandates. His civil behaviors towards others were a precaution born of the slightly paranoid assumption that anyone could be an archdevil in disguise, but his respect for his master was genuine. He enjoyed and appreciated his role, having realized his association with Baalzebul granted him more power than he could access on his own. \n\nBaalzebul's First Consort was [[Baftis]], a quiet and subservient concubine that feared his wrath and normally acted only with his explicit permission. The Second Consort [[Lilith (archdevil)|Lilith]] was a somewhat different story. Baalzebul gave her to Moloch as a transparent gift to curry his favor and perhaps to leverage the alluring devil's talent for keeping others distracted. Over time her loyalty to Baalzebul ebbed as she came to resent her service to Moloch, feeling of powerlessness, and being moved around at Baalzebul's behest. She returned to Maladomini after Moloch's fall, but her resentment only grew as she was relegated to Second Consort and made to endure the Slug Archduke's revolting touch. Ultimately she chose to stay with Baalzebul over Glasya, if for no other reason than to find a weakness to exploit so she might replace him, but until then would counsel him in his schemes in the hopes they both might be returned to glory.\n\nThere was also the matter of Baalzebul's former servant Tartach, for whom Baalzebul made no attempts to conceal his hatred for and tried to kill on several occasions. When the former celestial servant first descended into the Hells, he bound his fate to Baalzebul, who wasted no time dispatching him to act as Moloch's legate. Despite always maintaining a loyal façade, he chafed at the assignment, believing himself to have been relegated to a lesser position to neutralize him. He languished for ages, entering the scheme against Moloch to try and escape his fate, only for the Hag Countess to take Malbolge, leaving him to return to Maladomini and serve an abominable slug. There he met Glasya, who convinced him to join her after she became archduchess, although Tartach saw his position as yet a stepping stone to the ranks of archduke. He set his eyes on replacing his old master, who he detested and found foolish and weak even if he would still never say it out loud."

        },
        "History": "Baalzebul was originally the archon known as Triel, and one of the most powerful and beautiful ones to be found in Celestia. Unfortunately, Triel came to crave more power and authority than the Mount would grant him, and became blinded by ambition. His selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from the Seven Heavens. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, favored and quickly promoted Triel to the ranks of baatezu nobility.\n\nHis ruthless lust for power served him well in Hell, and before long Baalzebul, and at one point was second only to Asmodeus himself.\n\nHowever, Baalzebul later attempted to take the Dark Lord's throne, although the manner with which he did so to get him punished was disputed. but more recently it was thought that he altered documents to confuse the bureaucracy of Hell and make Asmodeus seem incompetent, a plan upended by the unpredictable [[Blood War]] before his actions were discovered. Maladomini was thought to have become a warzone between Baalzebul, who was attempting to hide his actions, and the other archdukes trying to expose his conspiracy, supposedly resulting in the ruined state of many of Maladomini's cities.\n\nWhatever his crime, a series of bizarre penalties befell Baalzebul; a retroactive curse turning him into a slug for a year per each lie he had told to a devil, his inability to strike deals without disaster befalling his associate, having his castle turned to excrement and filled with filth and having his dominion of Malbolge stripped from him. He recently returned to his old form, as his vanity forbade him from further extending the duration of his punishment.\n\nEven as a slug, Baalzebul still held great influence and managed massive feats of deception, such as supposedly creating the [[meazel]]s by promising to save a kingdom from dying of an awful, hunger-inducing blight. Whether they knew of his identity was unclear but upon agreeing they found themselves rendered immune to the plague but still suffering from its torturous symptoms and only able to feed upon the flesh of sentient beings, although Baalzebul's creations had a tendency to ally with the cults of his enemies.",
        "Rumors": "{{quote\n|Temptation is the best tool to use against the holy. In the back of their pure little minds, those archons always think they are missing something. And they are.\n|[[Rule-of-Three]]\n}}\nSome reports claimed that Asmodeus was the one who instigated Baalzebul's transformation into a devil rather than the infernal powers of Baator. In fact, it was rumored that Asmodeus himself personally masterminded Triel's fall by appearing in the form of flower whose beautiful exterior belied its venomous nature. While persistent, the myth had no corroborating evidence."
