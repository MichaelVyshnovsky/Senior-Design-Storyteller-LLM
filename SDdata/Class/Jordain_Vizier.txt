| classname       = Jordain viziers
Jordain viziers were specially trained members from House Jordain who dedicated their lives in service of the upper-class Halruaan spellcasters. They forewent the use of any magic or any magical devices for a broader knowledge of the arcane and a life of service to Halruaas magocracy.
Viziers underwent exhaustive training and went through distinct ordeals for their service. This began with an education and dedication to the study and understanding of magic. An upbringing in House Jordain included many academic disciplines, familiarity with legends and lore from a number of lands, knowledge of at least four languages, including common and Halruaan, and worship of either Azuth or Mystra.
They were indoctrinated to always obey Halruaan authorities and wizards, follow all laws of Halruaa and never cast any spells or use magic items. Viziers were also expected to maintain abstinence from any spellcasting or use of devices that would mimic or mirror spell-like effects. Failure to do so would warrant the intervention of a magehound.
Upon graduation, Jordain viziers were sterilized and thus were unable to have children. They were also trained to seldom handle money so as to lessen any possible lure and seduction of material goods. These practices exemplified the actions needed to imbue the viziers with their calm, placid demeanor. They were taught to value philosophy over materialism and maintain a demeanor that was unexcitable in the face of wondrous magic.
Jordain viziers were masters in mnemonic skills and deductive reasoning this led to exceptional eidetic memory, as well as drawing exceptionally accurate conclusions. Their honed memories and rigorous and logical thought processes allowed them to make lightning-fast deductions and state reasonable facts about people and places about which they possessed very limited knowledge. This granted them exceptional combat insight.
Although they were forbidden from practicing magic, viziers were trained to turn their inherent magic resistance outward into spell-like abilities. They could uniquely counter opposing arcane spellcasters magic as if casting the spell.
