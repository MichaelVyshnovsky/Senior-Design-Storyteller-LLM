        "mainbody": "ilkwhispers were specialty priests of the Church of Sune who focused on spreading their goddess love and passion.\nSilkwhispers often represented Sune by playing roles as matchmakers, councilors in etiquette, spies, negotiators, and seducers.\nThese individuals were aware of the power they held over members of the opposite sex and used that power to their advantage, though they did so with subtlety and poise.\nSilkwhispers were masters of espionage and were usually skilled actors. They were skilled in determining when someone was lying.\nThey could cast the wizard spell charm person on a daily basis and regained the spell by praying to Sune.\nFemale silkwhispers usually wore sheer gowns to capture attention. Males favored kilts with loose shirts. Both also carried a long hooded cloak of red velvet on one side and black on the other should the need for modesty or stealth be required. They were not very skilled in martial combat so usually only carried small weapons. They never wore armor.\nSilkwhispers could not turn undead."
