        "Abilities": "Silkwhispers were masters of espionage and were usually skilled actors. They were skilled in determining when someone was lying.\n\nThey could cast the [[wizard]] [[spell]] ''[[charm person]]'' on a daily basis and regained the spell by praying to Sune.",
        "Possessions": "Female silkwhispers usually wore sheer gowns to capture attention. Males favored kilts with loose shirts. Both also carried a long hooded [[cloak]] of red velvet on one side and black on the other should the need for modesty or stealth be required. They were not very skilled in martial combat so usually only carried small weapons. They never wore [[armor]].\n\nSilkwhispers could not [[turn undead]]."
