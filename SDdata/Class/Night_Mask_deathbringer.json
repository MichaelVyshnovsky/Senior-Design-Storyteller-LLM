        "mainbody": "Night Mask deathbringers were elite agents of the Night Masks in Faerûn.\nNight Mask deathbringers served the leadership of the Night Masks as their most elite assassins and lieutenants. They were feared by the natives of Westgate, and were hungry for power in their own right.\nThe vampiric leadership of the Night Masks created the deathbringers as unique intermediaries between themselves and those outside of the guild. Using the inherent strength in their blood, The Faceless and his Night Masters chose elite members of the Night Masks to become bizarre hybrids, neither fully mortal nor truly undead. These creatures were the deathbringers, and they learned to harness their new powers to aid their own quests for power and to increase the might of the Night Masks as a whole.\nNight Mask deathbringers exuded auras of death, which made all animals (except for bats, wolves, and rats) uncomfortable.\nThese evil agents could use the power of their partially undead body to crawl along walls and ceilings. In addition, Night Mask deathbringers could cause others to become charmed. The charmed victims became fully under the deathbringers commands by being fed three drops of the deathbringers own blood. This charm became more powerful as the deathbringers became more experienced."
