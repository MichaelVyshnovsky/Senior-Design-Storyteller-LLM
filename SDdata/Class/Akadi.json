        "mainbody": "'''Akadi''' ({{Pronounce|ah|KAH|dee|refs=}} was the embodiment of the [[element of air]] and [[goddess]] of elemental air, speed, and flying creatures. As an immortal being of freedom and travel, the '''Queen of Air''' instructed her followers to move as much as possible from place to place and from activity to activity.",
        "Description": "Akadi was both the whispering wind and the turbulent tempest, sweet and moist at times while bitter and cold at others, her form changing with the seasons. In religious depictions she was often portrayed as a giant, blue, translucent woman with huge feathery wings that trailed away into the clouds. The Lady of the Winds was revered in both male and female aspects in different parts of the world, and the distinction between these representations made no difference to her faithful.\n\nThe Queen of Air's avatar usually appeared as a {{SI|160|ft|long=yes}} tall column of swirling winds, reminiscent of (but not actually) a giant tornado reaching into the clouds. Her voice could range in volume from the slightest breeze to an insistent squall audible for miles in every direction.",
        "Personality": "Akadi's reactions were difficult to gauge, for she demonstrated almost alien behavior towards most mortals not native to the Plane of Elemental Air. Like the other elemental lords she was relatively uncaring towards her [[Toril]]lian followers, yet did seem to have some small degree of affection for them. This was most often displayed when large offering were made however, so it could be argued that she only cared when bribed.",
        "Activities": "Akadi's wings were said to send the winds across Faerun's surface. She carried many sights and sounds along the journey, but never stopped to make clear the importance of her travels to others. While she could be appealed to alter or stop the wind, or to provide good flying currents and gentle rain, she would neither stop nor create true storms, for such things were within the domain of [[Talos]] and [[Umberlee]].",
        "Relationships": "Akadi had many allies, including [[Quorlinn]] and [[Syranita]], but she was enemies with [[Grumbar]], the elemental god of earth and a fellow greater power. The [[archomental]] [[Yan-C-Bin]] wanted to challenge her power, but in truth Akadi had no superiors among aerial beings.\n\nThe elven goddess [[Aerdrie Faenya]] was also reported to be an aspect of Akadi.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Clergy": "Before dawn, clerics of Akadi prayed for their divine spells so they were able to chant their incantations on the morning winds. The church of Akadi did not have many official holidays, and there was only one holy day of the order, which was [[Midsummer]]. Worshipers gathered in the [[Shaar]], at the ruins of [[Blaskaltar]], where the first shrine to Akadi was constructed. The ancient shrine itself was lost to many years of erosion by wind and rain. The chant of heroes of their faith was spoken, while new names were added to the list of those who had died during the past year.\n\nThe priests of Akadi were divided into two primary philosophies according to the manner in which they spread her dogma, though were otherwise similar in their practices. The Whisper worked quietly, trying to discreetly bring about change, while the Roar were those who openly preached the Lady of Air's dogma.",
            "Orders": "The priests of Akadi were often arranged into small sects, which followed either the Whisper or the Roar. They included:\n* [[Knights of the Wind's Four Quarters]]: a [[crusader]] order that carried out quests for church elders or fought with the followers of Grumbar\n* [[Companions of the Summer Wind]]: An order of [[good]] [[mystic]]s\n* [[Disciples of Spring's Breeze]]: An order of [[neutral]] mystics\n* [[Alliance of Midwinter's Teeth]]: An order of [[evil]] mystics\n* The [[Azure Guard]]: An elite guard of a dozen female [[air genasi]] fighters who served as Akadi's [[Proxy|proxies]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].",
            "Worship in Zakhara": "On the continent of [[Zakhara]], Akadi was called one of the [[Zakharan pantheon#The cold gods of the elements|cold gods of the elements]]. As they were seen as uncaring for human affairs, they were considered opposed to the Land of Fate's pervasive culture of [[Enlightenment]]. Only a few Zakharans were willing to worship a cold god in order to gain power.<ref>",
            "Worship in the Hordelands": "Within the [[Hordelands]], Akadi was known as '''Teylas''', also called the '''Lord of the Sky''' and '''Lord of Storms''', and was the God of Heaven to the nomads of the steppe.\n\nTeylas monitored the nomads and herdsmen of the great steppes, sending rain and blessings to protect them from evil spirits. He also sent savage storms when he was angered to strike at his enemies."
        },
        "History": "Akadi was considered one of the four elemental deities, a god who remained unchanged by history and the passage of time.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Akadi was reported to be not a true goddess but a [[primordial]], a member of an elemental race once in competition with the gods before they were driven away to [[Abeir]]. As one of the few primordials who did not war with the gods, Akadi remained in power on [[Toril]].\n\nOver the course of the [[Second Sundering]], Akadi left Toril for Abeir. However, she still seems to have a presence in [[Faerûn]]."
