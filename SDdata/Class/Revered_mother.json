Wealthy individuals were expected to pay for these services, but revered mothers aided those in need for free.\nThese individuals were always human women of Mulhorandi descent. They were \"revered\" because of their wisdom and knowledge.\nRevered mothers could used a number of powers on a daily basis including charm person or mammal, music of the spheres, divination, commune, consequence, charm monster, restore youth, and restoration. They could remove or dispel charms by touch as well. They could bestow a curse upon anyone threatening a pregnant woman or child.\nRevered mothers carried a variety of weapons including a sling, clubs, daggers, flails, and staves. Their preferred armor was padded, chainmail, leather armor, studded leather, and they sometimes carried a shield."
