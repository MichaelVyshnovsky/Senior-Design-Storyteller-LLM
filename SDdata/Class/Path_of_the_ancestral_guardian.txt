The Path of the Ancestral Guardian was a primal path for barbarians from clans and tribes that held special reverence for their deceased ancestors.
These barbarians decorated their bodies with elaborate tattoos that honored the lives and deeds of their forebears. These tattoos often depicted epic battles against monstrous creatures and other sagas that were shared down through the generations.
Ancestral guardians believed that long-dead warriors from their tribes continued their afterlife as spirits, and passed down wisdom and guidance to their descendents in times of need.
Barbarians that walked the path of the Ancestral Guardian learned to tap into the spirit world in battle. Whenever they entered into their barbarous rage, spectral warriors appeared and hindered their foes in battle.
Experienced barbarians could form a spiritual shield and protected themselves and their allies. Over time, ancestral guardians learned how to turn their foes attacks against them, causing the spirits of their ancestors to retaliate against an enemy when they were struck in battle.
Veteran ancestral guardians learned how to not only conjure the spirits of their forebears, but communicate with them as well. They could consult with their ancestor to better understand the potential outcome of an event or impose upon them to glean insight to a location beyond their senses.
