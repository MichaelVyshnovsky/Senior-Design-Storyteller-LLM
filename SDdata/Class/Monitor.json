        "mainbody": "onitors were specialty priests of the Church of Mystra who were tasked by the Lady of Mysteries with ensuring magic was not abused.\nThey were tasked with destroying cursed items, keeping the balance of magical power, and aiding wizards unjustly accused of crimes.\nAll monitors were either humans, elvess, or half-elves. Their minds were very analytical and they viewed magic with a lawful regard. Their dedication to their duties often made them seem brusque to others, though that was not their intent.\nA monitor could identify an item once per day purely by sight. They could also dispel magic several times per day and detect magic three times per day. Monitors could turn undead like normal priests which was a special gift from Kelemvor to honor his friendship with Mystra when they were mortals.\nWild magic areas had no effect on a monitors spells.\nMonitors wore the traditional blue robes of Mystras clergy. Each wore a silver necklace adorned with stars that was both their badge of office and holy symbol. Though they could wear any armor they wished, monitors could only wield weapons used by normal wizards."
