        "Culture": "All monitors were either [[human]]s, [[elves]]s, or [[half-elves]]. Their minds were very analytical and they viewed magic with a lawful regard. Their dedication to their duties often made them seem brusque to others, though that was not their intent.",
        "Abilities": "A monitor could ''[[identify]]'' an item once per day purely by sight. They could also ''[[dispel magic]]'' several times per day and ''[[detect magic]]'' three times per day. Monitors could [[turn undead]] like normal priests which was a special gift from [[Kelemvor]] to honor his friendship with Mystra when they were mortals.\n\n[[Wild magic]] areas had no effect on a monitor's [[spell]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Monitors wore the traditional blue robes of Mystra's clergy. Each wore a silver necklace adorned with stars that was both their badge of office and [[holy symbol]]. Though they could wear any [[armor]] they wished, monitors could only wield weapons used by normal wizards."
