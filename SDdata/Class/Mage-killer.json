        "mainbody": "'''Mage-killers''' were rare individuals who mastered the use of combat [[magic]] specifically to be used against other [[spellcaster]]s.",
        "Culture": "These individuals were often [[bounty hunter]]s who specialized in tracking down and capturing, or slaying, [[mage]]s. Followers of both [[Azuth]] and [[Shar]] often hired them for jobs. Azuth's faithful used mage-killers as a last resort against a mage who continually ignored their condemnation of their abuse of magic. Shar's faithful usually had a mage-killer execute a target in a public manner to send a grisly message and weaken [[Mystra]]'s hold on the [[Weave]].",
        "Abilities": "Mage-killers often developed martial skills designed to be effective against magic-users. They could cast [[spell]]s used by [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s. Mage-killers possessed an assortment of skills allowing them to gather information on their targets and hunt them without being discovered. Given their extensive knowledge of the spells they used to attack others, mage-killers stood a better chance of resisting the effects if the same spells were used against them.",
        "Possessions": "They typically carried a variety of equipment similar to normal bounty hunters."
