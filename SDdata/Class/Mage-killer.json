        "mainbody": "Mage-killers were rare individuals who mastered the use of combat magic specifically to be used against other spellcasters.\nThese individuals were often bounty hunters who specialized in tracking down and capturing, or slaying, mages. Followers of both Azuth and Shar often hired them for jobs. Azuths faithful used mage-killers as a last resort against a mage who continually ignored their condemnation of their abuse of magic. Shars faithful usually had a mage-killer execute a target in a public manner to send a grisly message and weaken Mystras hold on the Weave.\nMage-killers often developed martial skills designed to be effective against magic-users. They could cast spells used by wizards and priests. Mage-killers possessed an assortment of skills allowing them to gather information on their targets and hunt them without being discovered. Given their extensive knowledge of the spells they used to attack others, mage-killers stood a better chance of resisting the effects if the same spells were used against them.\nThey typically carried a variety of equipment similar to normal bounty hunters."
