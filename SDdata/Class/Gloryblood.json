        "mainbody": "Glorybloods were specialty priests of the Church of Tempus who specialized in military tactics, strategy, logistics and morale.\nGlorybloods disdained commanding from afar, preferring instead to lead by example, often at the frontline of combat. They were intolerant of combat mistakes made by others, drilling such mistakes out of their comrades with skills practice.\nThese individuals radiated a sense of natural command and authority among others, distinguishing them from common soldiers and other followers of Tempus. Their presence inspired others among Tempus faithful to fight harder for his glory. If ever forced to retreat a gloryblood would swear to one day finish the original task.\nThe glory of Tempus exuded from a gloryblood to all comrades within sight of them up to , making them more dangerous and effective in combat.\nA gloryblood could not turn undead or cast spells from the healing sphere.\nA glorybloods armor was usually battered and bloodied from its frequent use. Most favored chain mail, splint mail or plate mail. They carried the weapon of choice that best suited them."
