        "mainbody": "The Grave domain was a deity domain pertaining to the line between life and death. Deities of this domain were aware of the fundamental importance of death and the afterlife and regarded the undead as abominations. Therefore, clerics of this domain were concerned with ensuring peace for the dead and comfort for the dying, as well as delaying death for those that still had great accomplishments ahead of them.\nNovice spellcasters were able to freely cast bane and false life, and later gentle repose and ray of enfeeblement. Clerics of some experience could cast revivify and vampiric touch and later blight and death ward. Those that were masters of this domain had access to antilife shell and raise dead.\nIn addition, Grave domain clerics gained access to the power path to the grave."
