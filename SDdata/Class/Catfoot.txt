A catfoot was a specialty priest of the Church of Mask who belonged to one of two branches of clerics designed to help bolster Masks worship following the Cyrinishad incident.
There was no plural word for catfoot as the clergy disliked the sound of "catfeet."
A catfoots locale was always an urban setting where they collected money from other thieves, provided healing and general counsel, and came to the defense of other thieves.
In addition to the wealth they collected for the church, Mask encouraged a catfoot to steal wealth for themselves as well, provided he got his cut of course.
A catfoot was intimately knowledgeable about their home city. This knowledge came in many forms including the best escape routes, shortcuts, safe houses, and which city guards could be bribed. A catfoot possessed all of the skills and abilities of common thieves.
A catfoot could not turn undead.
They always dressed in either black or gray. If a catfoot chose to wear leather armor then it was dyed black or gray as well. They favored a black or dark blue hooded cloak worn with either a domino mask that covered their eyes or a full face mask. They carried any type of weapon used by common thieves.
