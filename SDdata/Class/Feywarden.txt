Feywardens were specialty priests devoted to Corellon Larethian, the Creator of the Elves.
All feywardens were elves or half-elves, with the vast majority being moon elves or gold elves. They were highly regarded among elves. A drow could not become a feywarden.
Feywardens were completely immune to the paralyzing touch of ghouls and ghasts, and resistant to similar touch attacks from other undead such as lichs. They were also immune to all hold spells and resistant to spider venom.
In addition to their normal spells, feywardens could cast sixth sense, faerie fire, idea, strength (including a variant that enhanced their dexterity), abjure, minor creation, enchanted weapon, major creation, banishment, prismatic spray, holy word, and sunray once per day. Goblinoids found it particularly difficult to resist spells cast by a feywarden.
Feywardens did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield, nor the armor they could wear. All were skilled in the use of the longsword and longbow.
