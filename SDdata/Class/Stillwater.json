        "Here's a jest for you: why are Stillwaters' cloaks dyed brown? To hide the bootprints all over their backs!\n|''[[Mendryll Belarod]]''\n}}\n'''Stillwaters''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Eldath]] who devoted themselves to peace and tranquility.<ref name": "\"WaPotR-p76\" >",
        "mainbody": "",
        "Activities": "A stillwater would not raise a hand in anger no matter what heinous act was being committed against them or in their presence. They did their best to use reason to talk others out of such barbarity.",
        "Culture": "Stillwaters evolved of their own volition from their general disgust of warfare and combat. Many within [[Eldath]]'s clergy looked down upon them as being too pacifistic to be of any use. Stillwaters exuded peace and tranquility wherever they went, believing that it would bring them closer to Eldath.",
        "Abilities": "Stillwaters could speak a ''[[soothing word]]'' that would magically cease hostilities around them for several minutes. This power could be used several times per day depending on the stillwater's skill. Stillwaters could also cast ''[[sleep]]'' and ''[[forget]]'' once per day.\n\nThese individuals were prevented from using any [[magic item]]s or [[spell]]s that caused harm to others.",
        "Possessions": "Given their extreme pacifistic nature, stillwaters never wore [[armor]] nor carried any weapons. They donned long [[robe]]s or gowns and [[cloak]]s. Many chose to wear garlands in their hair of whatever local flower represented peace."
