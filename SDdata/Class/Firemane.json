        "mainbody": "iremanes, also called Lights of the Lions Mane, were specialty priests devoted to Nobanion, the King of Lions.\nThe priests of Nobanion served as guardians against evil, particularly against Malar and his followers. They often served as judges or constables in smaller communities.\nThese priests were quite adept at tracking and surviving on their own in the wild. They were able to call upon a wide variety of feline companions through their summoning magic.\nFiremanes assuming a feline form, either as their natural form or via magic, were skilled in fighting with their natural weaponsâ€“i.e. their claws and teeth. They could execute brief periods of ferocious wild striking to overwhelm their opponents at the cost of a high expenditure of energy.\nDepending on their expertise, firemanes could cast the following spells once per day lionheart, roar of the king, pride of Nobanion, and feline form. All firemanes eventally became immune to all forms of magical fear.\nFiremanes typically carried a spear or any type of bludgeoning weapon. They preferred hide armor but were allowed to wear heavy forms of armor. They wore the symbol of Nobanion, an unblinking lions eye, painted on their foreheads."
