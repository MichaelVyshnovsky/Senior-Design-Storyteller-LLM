        "mainbody": "'''Firemanes''', also called '''Lights of the Lion's Mane''', were specialty priests devoted to [[Nobanion]], the King of [[Lion]]s.",
        "Activities": "The priests of Nobanion served as guardians against evil, particularly against [[Malar]] and his followers. They often served as judges or constables in smaller communities.",
        "Abilities": "These priests were quite adept at tracking and surviving on their own in the wild. They were able to call upon a wide variety of [[feline]] companions through their [[Summoning sphere|summoning]] magic.\n\nFiremanes assuming a feline form, either as their natural form or via magic, were skilled in fighting with their natural weaponsâ€“i.e. their claws and teeth. They could execute brief periods of ferocious wild striking to overwhelm their opponents at the cost of a high expenditure of energy.\n\nDepending on their expertise, firemanes could cast the following spells once per day: ''[[Lionheart (Nobanionite spell)|lionheart]]'', ''[[roar of the king]]'', ''[[pride of Nobanion]]'', and ''[[feline form]]''. All firemanes eventally became immune to all forms of magical ''[[fear]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Firemanes typically carried a [[spear]] or any type of bludgeoning weapon. They preferred [[hide armor]] but were allowed to wear heavy forms of [[armor]]. They wore the symbol of Nobanion, an unblinking lion's eye, painted on their foreheads."
