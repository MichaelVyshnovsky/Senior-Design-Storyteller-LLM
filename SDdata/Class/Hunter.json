They tailored their fighting style according to the threats they may face, their preferred weapon of choice, and how best to avoid or mitigate attacks directed at them.\nAll hunters chose one of several distinct fighting styles, each of which were more efficient against a different type of foe.\n* Colossus Slayer A style how to gradually weaken and exhaust a single imposing opponent. After inflicting even a single wound, they learned how to deliver more lethal attacks.\n* Giant Killer The style that utilized well-time counterattacks to give the hunter an edge. It took advantage of the slow, lumbering attacks of giant-sized creatures, mitigating the threat they otherwise presented.\n* Horde Breaker A fighting style focused on intercepting and slaying numerous opponents. These hunters gracefully connected one attack to another as they dispatched foe after foe.\nHunters that preferred to be in the thick of battle developed whirling maneuvers that allowed them to strike each enemy nearby. Those that preferred bows, crossbows, and other ranged weapons, learned how to fire massive volleys of projectiles in mere moments.\nAs they became more experienced, hunters developed numerous defensive techniques to remain out of harms way. Some hunters taught themselves how to avoid opportunistic attacks made by foes, while others studied the attacks of a single foe in order to gain advantage. They became masters of evasion, dodging away from opponents strikes to lessen any harm, and even redirecting their opponents attacks against their own allies."
