        "mainbody": "celestial patron was one possible sponsor for a warlock. If a bargain was made between a warlock and a being from the Upper Planes, such as an empyrean, ki-rin, solar, unicorn, or some other resident of the realms of good, the warlocks patron gave them access to certain powers, that included a suite of spells. Warlocks of such patrons were recorded to exist by the crime lord and beholder, Xanathar.\nThese individuals were often quite successful at establishing trust between different parties.\nStarting off, beginner warlocks who had chosen a celestial sponsor would gain two cantrips light and sacred flame. They were also able to heal their allies wounds, and should they become experienced enough, they could resist radiant damage. These warlocks would also find themselves having an additional pool of health after they had rested, and may have also been able to resist death from crucial blows.\nNovice warlocks of such a pact could cast cure wounds, guiding bolt, flaming sphere, and lesser restoration. The Celestial would grant both daylight and revivify to experienced spellcasters. Those that were very skilled and were still sponsored by their patron would gain access to guardian of faith and wall of fire, as well as flame strike and greater restoration."
