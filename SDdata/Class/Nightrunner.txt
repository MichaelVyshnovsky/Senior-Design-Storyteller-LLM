A '''nightrunner''' was a [[specialty priest]] of the [[Church of Mask]] who specialized in operating within wilderness environments and dungeons.<ref name="WaPotR-p93" >

==Activities==
Nightrunners were commonly associated with [[adventurer]]s where they could exhibit how Mask's blessings were useful even outside of settled areas.

==Culture==
They did not hide the fact that they were priests of Mask. Nightrunners were usually confident and extremely opportunistic.

==Abilities==
Many of their abilities were parallel to skilled thieves, including their awareness of their surroundings, their ability to backstab enemies, climb, move about in silence, and remain hidden.

A nightrunner could only [[turn undead|turn]] weaker [[undead]].

==Possessions==
They typically wore [[leather armor]] and dressed like normal adventurers. Nightrunners wielded any weapon appropriate for a common thief. Their sacred [[dagger]], which also served as their [[holy symbol]], was stamped on the bottom of the hilt with the symbol of Mask.
