        "mainbody": "Bear warriors were crazed warriors who adopted the bear as their totem animal.\nThe majority of these warriors were barbarians and usually the champion of their tribe or village.\nBear warriors tapped into the spirit of a bear, gaining immense strength and ferocity during combat. They could transform into a bear when enraged. Examples included black bears, brown bears, and dire bears for particularly powerful bear warriors. This could happen several times per day so long as the bear warrior was enraged. They had a heightened sense of smell in either their normal form or bear form.\nHagar Hlutwigsson, a hagspawn inhabiting Waterdeep in the , was a bear warrior."
