The '''Circle of the Moon''' comprised [[druid]]s that were seen as among the fearsome protectors of the wild. They dwelled within the most perilous stretches of wilderness, perfectly comfortable surrounding themselves with only animals and beasts for [[tenday]]s at a time.

{{Quote|Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of nature who haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness.|Anonymous.{{Cite MTG|AFR|177|Circle of the Moon Druid|[[Nicholas Elias]]}}}}

==Activities==
Circle of the Moon druids gathered together every month when [[Sel没ne (moon)|Sel没ne]] shown brightest in the night's sky. At these conclaves, each member shared with others new accounts of their time in the wild, along with any new dangers they encountered.

==Culture==
These druids tended to be highly mutable individuals, who preferred to experience nature in multiple ways. Some days they navigated the forest floor as a fearsome beast, on others they soared across the night's sky as a bird of prey.

Many druids from [[Emerald Enclave]], and others from the [[Circle of Swords]] near [[Neverwinter]], were also members of the Circle of the Moon.

==Abilities==
Druids of this circle drew upon the power of Sel没ne itself to bolster their shape-changing abilities. They could ''[[wild shape]]'' more swiftly than other druids, and chose from the forms of more bestial animals. Additionally, transformed druids could heal themselves using unspent [[primal magic]] power. Wild shaped druids of the Moon were considered far more efficient predators than those from other circles.

Over time, Circle of the Moon druids became so powerful in their wild shape form, their attacks struck true as any [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] weapon. They could inflict similar damage upon those individuals and beings that could only be harmed by magical weapons.

Powerful druids mastered the elements in their wild shape form. In addition to their bestial forms, they also learned how to transform into [[air elemental|air]], [[earth elemental|earth]], [[fire elemental|fire]], and [[water elemental]]s.

Master druids of this circle could ''[[alter self|assume any humanoid form]]'' they wished at will.

==Notable Circle of the Moon Druids==
* [[Doric]], the [[tiefling]] agent of the [[Emerald Enclave]] who hailed from a community of [[elves]] in the [[Neverwinter Wood]].{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Thieves' Gallery}}
