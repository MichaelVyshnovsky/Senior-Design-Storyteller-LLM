        "mainbody": "Shapeshifters were a variety of druids that forwent the versatility of wild shaping in favor of embracing lycanthropy, usually of the werewolf variety, and specializing in the transformation that came with that condition.\nIn the 14 century DR, shapeshifter druids could be found in Faerûn across the Sword Coast, all the way up to the Icewind Dale region, as well as in west Faerûn in the nations of Amn and Tethyr.\nUnlike others afflicted with lycanthropy, shapeshifters had complete control over the condition, having undergone a series of intense study and training to master it.\nA shapeshifter druid typically fought with either daggers, darts, scimitars, slings, spears, or staves. They forwent armor of any kind and would only wield bucklers or shields not fashioned from metal.\n* Cernd, a high-ranking human shapeshifter that traveled throughout the Lands of Intrigue during the mid–14 century DR.\n* Voltinabulai, an elf shapeshifter that lived in the city of Baldurs Gate in the mid–14 century DR."
