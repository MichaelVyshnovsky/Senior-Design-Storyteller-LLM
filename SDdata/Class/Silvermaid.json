        "mainbody": "ilvermaids were specialty priests devoted to Lurue, the Unicorn Queen. As with all of Lurues clergy, silvermaids were always female humans, half-elves, or elves.\nSilvermaids provided aid and comfort to those in need. They were particularly fond of helping those with grand dreams and aspirations. Many silvermaids were filled with wanderlust and roamed across Faer√ªn.\nThese women were not only skilled horseback riders, but also at riding both unicorns and pegasi. They could speak with animals at will. Lurue protected them from all forms of poison and death spells, and they could never be magically charmed or held.\nSilvermaids gained a number of magical abilities depending on their skill including remove blindness or deafness, cure disease, dance of the unicorns, negative plane protection, neutralize poison by touch, and teleport without error. These powers could be used once per day.\nThose silvermaids truly pure of heart could summon a loyal unicorn companion. The unicorn would serve as the silvermaids mount and friend for its entire life provided the silvermaid never fell out of favor with Lurue. If the unicorn was slain for any reason Lurue would hesitate before granting the silvermaid another such companion.\nSilvermaids were not restricted with the weapons they used during combat, but all were trained in both the longsword and lance. With regards to armor the heaviest mail they could wear was chainmail. Many also carried a polished shield.\nMany silvermaids were served by a familiar similar to wizards. Their familiars were able to speak the silvermaids native tongue."
