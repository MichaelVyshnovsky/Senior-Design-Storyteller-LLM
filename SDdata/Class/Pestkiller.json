        "mainbody": "A '''pestkiller'''<ref group=\"note\" name=\"merger\">''[[Demihumans of the Realms]]'' states in its introduction that the \"pestkiller\" kit was partially a fusion of the \"pest controller\" and \"vermin slayer\" kits from ''[[The Complete Book of Dwarves]]''. It also lists many skill proficiencies that were introduced in ''The Complete Book of Dwarves''. was a professional expert in combating all manner of creatures considered vermin.",
        "Activities": "The standard priorities of any pestkiller on the job The study of live specimens was also necessary in order to devise effective [[poison]] powders. Some pestkillers were known to develop a peculiar sort of empathy and understanding towards certain vermin after extensive studying, though this never kept them from eliminating the pest.\n\nFor pests of small size and base intelligence, pestkillers designed and baited specialized traps for around 1 to 4 [[gold piece]]s.\n\nThe typical [[animal]]s considered \"vermin\" that pestkillers fought against ranged from all manner of arthropods (like [[centipede]]s and [[millipede]]s), arachnids ([[scorpion]]s and [[spider]]s), [[bat]]s, small [[lizard]]s, [[rat]]s, [[snake]]s, [[weasel]]s and [[giant weasel]]s. They also were known to combat more monstrous creatures and certain pestering [[humanoid]]s, such as [[carrion crawler]]s, [[jermlaine]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[mite]]s, [[rot grub]]s, all types of [[fungi]] and [[ooze]]s, and other ameboid creatures.",
        "Culture": "The life of a pestkiller was typically taken up by the small, industrious [[demihuman]] races of [[Faerûn]], namely [[hairfeet]], [[rock gnome]]s, [[shield dwarves]], and [[stout halfling]]s.\n\nBy the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], pestkillers had been a staple of many large cities all across Faerûn, such as [[Calimport]] and [[Neverwinter]]. They were also common in the cities along the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], as ships had a tendency to track rats into their port-cities. Beneath the surface, [[dwarf]] and [[gnome]] strongholds relied upon pestkillers yearly to combat the creatures of the [[Underdark]], as well as any vermin that stowed away in their food stores or trade goods.\n\nTheir line of work inevitably lead pestkillers to become experts in navigating city [[sewer]]s and urban [[dungeon]]s, or the varied tunnels and passageways of the stronghold they inhabited.\n\nWhile most were content with their profession, some pestkillers were enamored by the excitement of [[adventuring]]. Such individuals would aid adventuring companies in delving into vermin-infested dungeons or act as guides for those heading into subterranean areas in which they lived.\n\nDespite the essential work pestkillers provided society, few people were truly aware of the vast knowledge that they had. They were typically considered lower class, with few having any respect for them. This could even be the case among dwarves, as shield dwarf pestkillers often trimmed their beards short, which in turn made them perceived as having a lower status in the eyes of their fellow dwarves.",
        "Abilities": "A pestkiller was typically defined by their proficiency in capturing underground pests with traps,\n\nPestkillers were skilled in navigating and fighting in the constricted passageways and tunnels created by many kinds of vermin.\n\nBeyond their varied repertoire of skills, pestkillers were noted for building up an immunity to the various natural poisons and [[venom]]s produced by the monsters, insects, reptiles, snakes, spiders, and other vermin that they regularly faced. However, this tolerance did not extend to manufactured poisons, such as those that were commonly used by [[assassin]]s. Their extended exposure to the unsanitary environments vermin were found in also made pestkillers uniquely resilient towards many common infections, parasites, and non-[[magic]]al diseases.",
        "Possessions": "The outfit of a pestkiller was often dirty and odorous, but made of durable material. [[Boot]]s were considered a necessity, [[gloves]] and hand wrappings were common, and extra padding was often added to their elbows and knees to cushion them when crawling. [[Bandana]]s were a common accessory among dwarves. [[Belt]]s and other forms of straps were never used, as they ran the risk of getting snagged in the narrow environs that pestkillers frequented.\n\nIf armor was ever needed, pestkillers would opt for something light, allowing them a granter range of movement. If their armor was loose, a baggy [[tunic]] would be worn over top to mitigate the chance of it snagging on projections in narrow passages and to muffle noise. Armor would be paired with a thick [[leather]] [[helmet]], fastened down over the head, and occasionally outfitted with a metal plate to guard against attacks in crawlspaces.\n\nIn terms of weaponry, pestkillers utilized many of the same tools as [[rogue]]s, as well as [[blowgun]]s, [[hand axe]]s, [[short bow]]s, [[warhammer]]s, They also were known to manufacture poison powders of their own design, tailored to a specific vermin. These were most effective against \"cleanup crew\" monsters, like [[green slime]]s and rot grubs. Making this powder took 3 to 12 days and cost around 10 to 100 gp in supplies that could easily be acquired within any large city in the Realms.",
        "Combat": "In contrast to those who took up the life of a [[giant-killer]],<ref> their choice of study left pestkillers deficient in combating [[giant]]s, [[giant-kin]], [[ogre]]s, [[ogre magi]], and [[troll]]s."
