'''Vaprak''' ({{Pronounce|VÆP|ræk|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}}) the Destroyer of greed, destruction, frenzy, and violence [[Othea]], mother of [[giant]]s, had an affair with him, which led to the birth of the ogre race.

==Description==
Vaprak's avatar was a hideous humanoid ogre in form, He had mottled greenish-brown skin and taloned claws.

==Personality==
The Destroyer preferred to rip apart his enemies with his bare claws rather than use any weapons. He was always hungry.

==Powers==
Vaprak was exceptionally strong

==Realm==
Up until the Spellplague, Vaprak resided within the [[Abyss]], in the realm of [[Shatterstone]] in the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 524: Shatterstone|524{{th}} layer]]. Post-Spellplague, Vaprak resided within Nishrek.

==Relationships==
Vaprak had a reverent fear of the [[giant pantheon]] and was afraid of losing followers to them. Thus, he constantly urged his worshipers to frenzied aggression.

==Worshipers==
[[Ogre]]s{{Cite dragon/301/Malignant Growth: The Ecology of the Troll|64}} and [[troll]]s And some [[human]]s in the land of [[Thay]] also worshiped Vaprak as part of their evil pantheon, having a temple for him in the city of [[Bezantur]].

Occasionally, a [[frost giant]] would turn to the worship of Vaprak in exchange for physical prowess, in a ritual that involved devouring a willing troll sent by Vaprak. This process transformed the few who persevered into an [[everlasting one]], gaining enhanced strength and regenerative qualities as a result, although they attempted to hide such oddities. 

His worshipers favored him for his viciousness and destructive power. Vaprak sometimes rewarded his [[shaman]]s with a violent rage.

Vaprak the Destroyer's symbol was a taloned claw, All were required to eat their food greedily and fight often.

==History==
The true origin of Vaprak was in doubt; however, some giant tales claimed that he was the son of a horribly ugly and tall proto-ogress who disguised herself to seduce [[Annam All-Father]], leading to Vaprak's conception. Many scholars at least agreed that Vaprak was descended from Annam in some way,{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|14}} but if not directly then through one of his children.

Vaprak later had an affair with Annam's wife Othea, which led to the creation of the ogre race. (This was before her later affair with the god [[Ulutiu]], which resulted in the creation of the [[giant-kin]].) The trolls believed that Vaprak also bore daughters, who became the mothers of their own race.

The [[oni]], in contrast, believed that both ogres and trolls were only the offspring of ancient [[human]] warriors who had been blessed by Vaprak, whereas it was their own race who were the true descendants of Vaprak.{{Cite dragon/349/Ecology of the Ogre Mage|68-72}} Though this was doubted by the [[human]] scholars of [[Kara-Tur]], the oni claimed that Vaprak sired three sons by [[demon]]s from the Abyss, named [[Anori]], [[Hakuni]], and [[Muaj]]. He caused his three demonic sons to be reborn as mortals on the [[Material Plane]], one son to each of three violent tribes. His sons, however, failed to lead their tribes in conquering the lands with their armies of ogres and trolls, being driven back by the civilized races. Enraged, Vaprak cursed his sons and exiled them forever from the Abyss, leaving them as mortals until their deaths. The descendants of Anori, Hakuni, and Muaj became the oni or [[ogre mage]]s.

Vaprak also comes into the tales of [[halfling]]s regarding the founding of [[Luiren]]. Long before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], the [[Lluirwood]] covered the lands that would later be Luiren. These forests were inhabited by Vaprak's ogres. The god [[Brandobaris]] appeared and challenged Vaprak first to catch him. Vaprak could never catch the nimble hin after chasing him endlessly for ten days and ten nights.

Next, Brandobaris challenged the ogre god to a contest of strength. Since Vaprak trusted in his own prowess, he accepted the challenge before hearing it fully. The test was to determine which god could remove a tree from the ground without damaging it. Vaprak ripped many trees from the ground but tore apart the roots of the trees in doing so. Brandobaris, on the other hand, carefully removed a tiny sapling without any harm to its single taproot. Vaprak was furious, but he had no choice but to admit defeat. He moved his ogres to the [[Toadsquat Mountains]] and left the Lluirwood to the halflings evermore.

Following the [[Spellplague]], Vaprak became an [[exarch]] of [[Gruumsh]] and made his home within that deity's plane of [[Nishrek]].
