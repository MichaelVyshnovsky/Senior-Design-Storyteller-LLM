Umberlee (
The symbol of Umberlee.|alt=
The Bitch Queens seldomly seen avatar was a giant woman with the body colored like the sea, of blues and greens. Her hands had talons. Her elbows had fins. She had green hair of seaweed and kelp. Her white eyes were reminiscent of pearls, and her voice sounded like the fiercest sea storm, booming with breaking waves. The goddess appeared in this form to terrify the mortals on board sinking ships. The towering avatar wore jewelry made out of seashells, carried a trident, and was dressed in a flowing cape made out of countless pale-purple jellyfish. Umberlees avatar laughed with malicious glee as she toyed with doomed vessels.
After the Godswar, the aspect of Umberlee that gathered her devotees from the Fugue Plane appeared as a humanoid with a manatee face and green seaweed hair.
The most common manifestations of the Bitch Queen were waves and winds of the seas. Sailors knew that when storms hit their ships, and the winds or waves carried sinister cold laughter or hissing words, they were facing the cruel goddess herself.
Following the Time of Troubles, Umberlees powers were decreased, and she could manifest gales of wind four times a day. Her watery manifestation in the form of waves did not have many limitations in the sea. She used wave forms that reached heights of  and which possessed considerable power. These waves could instantly kill an unlucky victim or grab and carry away items and treasures of value from the ships, including items such as rings and gauntlets.
Another common manifestation of the Great Queen of the Sea was in the shape of an aquatic monster of terrible size. She took on many shapes, including monstrous-sized sharks, krakens, and aquatic undead and undead lake-dwelling monsters. Her most notable aspect was the kraken-like Dweller that grew within the Temple-Under-The-Sea, slowly increasing its strength and corruption influence.
Umberlee rising from the sea to meet with her fellow 370x370pxSilvanus was technically Umberlees superior, as the ruler of the the Deep Wilds within which she resided. However, Umberlee did not see herself as Silvanus servant.
Umberlee openly fought with Selûne, the goddess of the moon whose light guided navigators at sea Chauntea, the goddess of the earth and land Sune, whose beauty spurred jealousy within the Bitch Queen and Valkur, the deity to whom sailors prayed for safe return from the sea.
Umberlee was a member of the Deities of Fury, a group that included Auril and Malar and was led by the Storm Lord Talos. As Talos encroached upon Umberlees portfolio since both deities ruled over storms, she attempted to distract him with a romantic relationship. 
Even though Talos was her superior and patron, he often attempted to usurp Umberlees power over sea storms and hurricanes, folding them under his own portfolio. Despite that, the Queen of the Depths positioned herself as a flirt, keeping herself in Talos good graces. Although her ambitions were limited by not being able to affect land directly, given the opportunity, she would have gladly destroyed her patron, taking his portfolio of destruction for herself.
The closest deity Umberlee could consider an ally was Auril, the fellow member of the Deities of Fury. When Umberlee required aid, she was likely to call on the Frostmaiden.
In the late 15th century DR, Umberlee was a part of the loosely related group of deities known as the First Circle to their worshipers. The First Circle consisted of the gods who lorded over nature Chauntea, Eldath, Mielikki, Silvanus, Auril, Malar, Talos, and Umberlee herself.

The Great Queen of the Sea was worshiped out of fear by most. Umberlee acted on her turbulent whims when making deals with mortals. Temples of Umberlee were few and far between, and the church was disorganized, universally hated throughout Faerûn, and perpetuated out of fear of the goddess. The organization of Umberlees church reflected her chaotic nature disputes were settled in favor of the strongest individual.
Druids who worshiped the First Circle also venerated Umberlee, as she was a representation of nature in its cruel form.
In the lavish magical hedge maze of Moonstone Palace, Evermeet, multiple globes of illusion depicting moments from the history of the elven race were placed. One of them depicted the birth of sea elves, with the avatar of Umberlee rising from the depths of a stormy sea.
Umberlee had worshipers among krakens, sahuagin, anguiliians, water genasi, and other evil sea creatures. A number of these were actually worshipers of Panzuriel, a deity with no power on Toril Umberlee merely granted spells on his behalf. In addition, some tanarri priests were known to pledge themselves to Umberlees service.
Most weresharks, created by the Queen of the Depths herself as a way to undermine her bitter opponent Selûne, venerated Umberlee out of admiration rather than fear.
The Undrowned and Umberlants held no ethical standards nor persuasions the only thing that was set in stone was their belief in the cruelty and viciousness of the sea, the most dangerous place. The folk who were brave enough to travel the savage seas should be ready to pay the price for their challenge to the Bitch Queens domain. The Church of Umberlees doctrine was fear all were to tremble before the Queens power, as her waves and winds were all-reaching. The mercy of the Great Queen of the Sea was to be bought with generous offerings, as they brought fair winds. All who dared to travel through her domain were to know that Umberlee controlled the monsters of the deep and the drowned dead. Priests and priestesses of Umberlee were to spread the holy word of the Bitch Queen and spread the fear of her rage, and perform no service in her name without collecting high tithe. They were to promote the fear of Umberlees waves and winds unless her clergy accompanied the travelers. The final divine directive was for the followers of Umberlees faith to slay anyone claiming the storms over the seas were Talos doing.
There were numerous shrines dedicated to Umberlee, predominantly located in port cities of the Sea of Fallen Stars and in the Nelanther Isles. Travelers by sea were sure to pay their tribute to the Bitch Queen, as the preaching of her clerics were built upon the terrible fate that would befall any who did not bring a sacrifice to Umberlee. Clerics were available at these temples, who, for a price, would travel with sailors to ensure no harm was inflicted.
Apart from the region around the Sea of Fallen Stars and at Nelanther Isles, Umberlee had places of worship at many ports. Among these were a temple in Urmlaspyr, Sembia, Murann, a small shrine in the city of Marsember in Cormyr, an opulent shrine in Athkatla, a shrine of Umberlee could be found in the palace Dangwaru on the Snout of Omgar, and another small shrine in Hillsfar on the Moonsea.

At some point before the 14 century DR, Umberlee flooded the city of Memnon and a part of Calimshan to inspire worship by fear. Since then, her temple in Memnon, adjacent to the citys cemetery, was kept in impeccable cleanliness with all its tiles polished to brilliance by the devotees of the goddess of the sea.
In 1358 DR during the Time of Troubles, Umberlee manifested herself in the Sea of Fallen Stars, where she entertained herself by destroying pirate islands with her storms and minions. Umberlee took an opportunity to visit the island of Kelthann during the Time of Troubles and exact revenge on the denizens of the island for their belief that winter storms in the sea came from Grumbars rivalry with the Bitch Queen. She made several attempts to wash the Kelthanni off the island with her powerful storms but failed to achieve her goal, strengthening the islanders belief in Grumbar, to Umberlees disdain.
After the end of that calamitous period of time, Kelthann remained ravaged by storms for some time, although not as powerful as when the Queens avatar was personally stirring the sea. With the efforts of the alliance of merchants, inhabitants of the coastal cities, and the Iron Throne, of all people, Umberlee was appeased and calmed the Sea of Fallen Stars by 1360 DR–1361 DR. During the same period of time, the Queen of the Depths was responsible for the creation of weresharks within the Realms to spite Selûne .
In 1360 DR, during the Crusade against the Tuigan invasion, Umberlee was responsible for almost destroying the ship that carried king Azoun Obarskyr IV across the Lake of Dragons. The vessel Welleran failed to pay the tithe to the Queen of the Sea and only stopped the deadly storm after King Azouns scribe sacrificed his most prized possession to the sea, the historical records of the ongoing Crusades.
In 1363 DR, during the Day of Wonders festival in Waterdeep, a wondrous mechanical dragon turtle sank after completing one lap around the harbor, becoming a part of the treasures of Umberlees Cache.
Circa 1372 DR, Umberlee led her local priestess Tasina Alcrest to acquire a mysterious artifact of power and deliver it to the Temple-Under-The-Sea in the Fiddlers Green underwater region of the Sea of Swords. There, a horrific sea-beast called the Dweller lived. That creature was one of the first aspects, the first avatars of the goddess since the Time of Troubles. The kraken-like Dweller grew and expanded its corrupting influence, nourished by the priestesses and sahuagin worshipers alongside Umberlees humanoid avatar manifestation.
By 1479 DR, recently abandoned Port Llast was claimed by Umberlee and her sea monsters.
Around the same year, a northlander who called herself the Storm Maiden led her followers on a crazed mission to take over the Sea of Swords, consumed by the power of the Bitch Queen. The Storm Maiden was defeated and disappeared along with her ship.
In 1484 DR, Umberlee pummeled Neverwinter with a devastating storm after Dagult Neverember offended the goddess by restricting regular sacrifices to her.
In 1490s DR, Umberlee contributed to the destruction unleashed upon the Sword Coast by the four elemental prophets. She empowered Gar Shatterkeel as her chosen, and Olhydra gave him powers of one of the prophets. After the prophets defeat, Gar found a way back to Toril and was re-empowered by his otherworldly patrons. Umberlee gifted him a powerful artifact, a trident called the Wave. With the Bitch Queens guidance, he was able to find an elemental node off the coast of Turmish at Umberlee’s Maw, opening the rift to the Elemental Plane of Water.
In the 15 century DR, a book called Shanties for the Bitch Queen was published and beloved by fishermen of the Western Heartlands.
*According to one legend, Umberlee once had a relationship with Iakhovas, variously described as a megalodon, wereshark, or sharkwere. She even granted him immortality. However, their relationship fell apart, and she sought revenge on him.
*There were some superstitions among the seafaring folk and pirates of the Sea of Fallen Stars. They believed that cutting hair and trimming nails while at sea angered Umberlee, who thought grooming to be an offering to her enemy Sune. It was forbidden to say the word "drown" while at sea as it was believed it attracted Umberlees attention. They also believed that if you fell overboard, it was useless to fight Umberlees will and learn to swim. 
*Legends claimed that Umberlee was responsible for the creation of cyclopskin. She placed a curse on giants, firbolgs, or some such creatures for their refusal to acknowledge the Bitch Queens control over winter storms.
