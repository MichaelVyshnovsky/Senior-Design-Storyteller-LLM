Paragons were specialty priests of the Church of Torm who behaved more like paladins and maintained a close relationship with the church mainly around Tantras in the Vast.
These individuals performed specific quests in Torms honor, hoping along the way to attract more followers for their god through their virtuous example. They were required to complete difficult heroic quests in order to advance their station.
Paragons were completely loyal to Torm and took any vows with extreme devotion. All paragons were human.
Paragons shared all of the abilities of a paladin save for their spell abilities. They also shared all of a paladins weaknesses.
Paragons wore white plate mail polished to a glistening shine. Large white helmets and sky-blue cloaks completed their ensemble. They usually did not carry a shield since most wielded either a two-handed sword or a bastard sword with two hands.
