        "mainbody": "Quorlinn (also spelled Quorlin) was a lesser deity of the winged kenku race.\nOn the off chance that Quorlinn did manifest an avatar, he appeared as a typical,  kenku wearing plain clothing and a black mask.\nQuorlinn was a peery and deceitful trickster god known to be easily irritated, bad-tempered, snappy, and fickle. He whined constantly about the responsibility of caring for the kenku and bemoaned his very godhood, complaining that it weighed him down.\nDespite these traits, Quorlinn was not actually evil, and was in fact strangely likable. The oddball was akin to a jaded jester,  and though he might be indifferent to matters of cosmic destiny, he was not truly uncaring. His attitude towards his patron race was possibly just an excuse stemming from insecurity and a concern that he was too weak to be a decent protector. The Raven had an edge of malice at times, but no true viciousness, and was even said to help races besides his own (and be embarrassed if confronted with such claims).\nAvatars of Quorlinn moved quite fast and flew several times faster. They could fight with beak and talon, and could cast the spells alter self, change self, dimension door, improved invisibility, rope trick, shadow door, and taunt, each twice a day. No natural bird or avian creature would attack them.\nWhen forced to fight, Quorlinns avatar wielded a +3 short sword of sword of quickness.\nThe Ravens realm of Filchnest was based in Krigala, the 1 layer of the Beastlands.\nQuorlinn did not have many friends among his divine peers.\nQuorlin was an ally of the elemental goddess Akadi, Lady of the Winds,With her power and portfolio, Akadi is a possible candidate for Quorlinns creator. as well as his fellow god of theft, the halfling deity Brandobaris.\nQuorlinn was worshiped by neutral kenku as a patron and creator deity, although he didnt send omens to his followers, let alone avatars. Even his priests had to whine at him for spells, and even then only got them three-quarters of the time. His priests and shamans alike could only get so powerful under him, and in many respects acted as thieves rather than conventional clerics at any rate.\nQuorlinns priests and shamans were particularly cunning and devious. They worked as spies, masterminded kidnapping operations, and set up traps and ambushes, but also worked to rescue kenku slaves, which they were bound to do. Cells and spy rings of priests gathered up and hoarded all kinds of secrets, though most of them were petty, and they refused to share them with other groups out of childish stubbornness.\nA number of obscure myths told of the creation of Quorlinn and the kenku. It was said that a certain deity, a potent, non-lawful sky god, had experimented in creation, but the effort was a failure, producing only the strange god Quorlinn. The sky god was too embarrassed to own up to its botched job, but the Raven would eventually prove his worth.\nAfter a series of legendary and dubious misadventures in which Quorlinn used disguises, thieving, trickery, and guile, often losing a few tail feathers for the effort, to bring his creator choice prizes, the sky god relented and rewarded Quorlinn with a race created in his own image the kenku. Quorlinn however was unexcited by this prospect, for he did not want the responsibility of being god to a whole race. Thus did Quorlinn teach the kenku the arts of disguise, theft, and magic, so they could look after themselves."
