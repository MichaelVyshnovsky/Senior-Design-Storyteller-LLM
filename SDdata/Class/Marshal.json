        "mainbody": "'''Marshal''' were honorable, martial leaders and tacticians from all walks of life.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Swashbucklers, Marshals, Dragonfire Adepts}} They were considered by many in the Realms to be an essential facet of an army.",
        "Activities": "Many marshals lived rather mercenary lives, hiring out for commission the strategic services of themselves and any forces they commanded. They could often be found traveling in the midst of armies or as part of [[adventuring companies]]. Most felt honor bound to fulfill any commission they undertook, but would not sacrifice the lives of the people they commanded &ndash; in such circumstances, they would rather choose to end their contract and find a new patron for their compatriots elsewhere.\n\nThe types of commissions that a marshal took on were generally reflective of their [[alignment]]. [[Good]]-aligned were often crusading types, seeking out [[evil]] to eradicate, whilst [[evil]]-aligned marshals tended to accept commissions that put them in invading and plundering forces. Those of a [[Law]]ful bent tended to accept commissions that involved the repelling of such foreign aggressors, while those of a [[chaos|chaotic]] bent were often found in proper [[mercenary]] companies.",
        "Culture": "All marshals in the Realms had significant military experience, with some being also [[fighter]]s or [[paladin]]s. Some marshals underwent some form of formal training and study to acquire their marked skills in leadership and battle strategy, usually in the army of a noble or within a military academy or war college. There existed several such colleges across the Realms, such as the [[Academy of Arms]] in [[Athkatla]]. Others started their lives as mere grunts footsoldiers, working their way up the ranks of an army and acquiring experience over time. The decision to undertake this profession sometimes grew from a want to follow in the footsteps of a parent that had served as an officer in an army or mercenary company.\n\nIn [[Cormyr]], marshals could be found amongst the ranks of the [[Purple Dragon knight]]s, where they often had to learn how to coordinate magical strategies alongside conventional military strategies as they worked alongside Cormyr's [[War Wizards]].\n\nMarshals viewed themselves and other marshals as being part of a select class in society,",
        "Abilities": "While all marshals had basic training in fighting and general knowledge of various forms of [[armor]] and weaponry, In some cases, this commanding aura was even found to improve [[spell]]casting abilities.",
        "Notable Marshals": "* [[Forthar Helvenstron]], a marshal who served as commander under the [[Zhentilar]] during their invasion of [[Shadowdale]] in [[1375 DR]].\n* [[Rolbanyion Zelnar]], an instructor at the Academy of Arms."
