Rogues to their core, these men and women owed allegiance to none but themselves.Saluk was a rogue class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.\nThere were no special requirements for saluks, and they had no special hindrances.\nSaluks usually roamed wherever they wanted. They survived by their skill at thieving, and lived for the moment. Freedom was what a saluk most appreciated. They would do what they wanted, when they wanted.\nSaluks usually had nothing to tie them down to one location. Even after scoring a successful haul, they typically spent their wealth quickly on superficial baubles or entertainment."
