Shadowcrafters were spellcasters of the Underdark who specialized in creating illusions from shadow magic.
Experts at manufacturing their own realities out of thin air, shadowcrafters were typically wizards or sorcerers with some aptitude for shadow illusion magic. The powers associated with shadowcrafters also appealed to a select few bards.
Most of a shadowcrafters abilities were focused on strengthening his or her shadow illusions, particularly those created through the spells shadow conjuration and greater shadow conjuration. Shadowcrafters specialized in strengthening these quasi-real shadows a veteran shadowcrafter could conjure up illusions that were nearly as strong as the real thing.
As they grew in power, shadowcrafters became more resistant toward illusions conjured by other casters&mdasheventually to the point that they could recognize illusions with great ease. Their shadow spells also grew in power, allowing them to more easily affect their foes. Finally, veteran shadowcrafters eventually became so attuned to shadow and illusion magic that they themselves became outsiders.
The drow of Menzoberranzan distrusted shadowcrafters, and would attack or drive them off on sight.
