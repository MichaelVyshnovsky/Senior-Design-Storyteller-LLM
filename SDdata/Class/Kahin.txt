Kahins (females were sometimes called kahinas) were the practitioners of an unusual and ancient faith in the burning land of Zakhara.Kahin was a cleric class kit for the Al-Qadim setting. Also called idol priests, they saw divinity not only in the gods but in all things, and saw a divine force at work in the universe as a whole. They did not, however, necessarily believe that this force worked toward a discernible goal. Kahins strove for balance and moderation both for themselves and the world around them. Together with the fact that they were often wandering, this attitude often led them to take the role of mediators, especially in Al-Badia society.
Each kahin channeled the power of the universe in a different way, through worship of a particular idol, holy site, or local god.
Kahins were very loosely organized, usually traveling without others of their faith, but recognized and helped each other whenever the need arose. Very experienced idol priests formed the Circle of Aged Masters and took upon themselves the instruction of like-minded youths.
The symbol of the kahin faith was six arrows pointing down arranged in an arc.
This faith had some common ground with the Durpari belief in Adama.
Kahins could be clerics of any race, but always had at least a partly neutral outlook.
Kahins eschewed all armor except hide.
As divine spellcasters, kahins could gain major access to the spheres of All, Animal, Divination, Elemental, Healing, Plant, and Weather. They could also gain minor access to the spheres of Creation, Protection, and Sun.
Members of the Circle of Aged Masters became step by step immune to a specific weapon type, an element, and a species of creatures.
Kahins could not turn or command undead creatures.
