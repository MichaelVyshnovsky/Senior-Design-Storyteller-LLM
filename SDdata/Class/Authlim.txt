'''Authlims''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Iyachtu Xvim]], the Godson of [[Bane]].

==Culture==
Authlims often served as spies for High Tyrannar [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

==Abilities==
''[[Fear]]'' [[spell]]s had no effect upon an authlim. They were able to heal themselves once per day by calling on Xvim's divine power. They could cast several spells on a daily basis including ''[[mace of Xvim]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', ''[[Poison (spell)|poison]]'', ''[[reaving blades]]'', ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', ''[[protection from good]]'', and ''[[cure critical wounds]]''. ''[[Heal]]'' could be cast once per tenday, ''[[gate]]'' once per month, and ''[[binding]]'' twice per month. Authlims could also generate an aura of fear for {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} around themselves.

==Possessions==
Authlims only wielded blunt melee weapons and [[javelin]]s. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were allowed to wear.
