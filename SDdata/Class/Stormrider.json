        "mainbody": "Stormriders were specialty priests of the Church of Talos who exemplified the Destroyers power through their ability to call natural storms.\nA stormriders main goal was to cause natural forms of destruction in Talos name.\nDespite the current weather, a stormrider always look disheveled as if they just walked through a violent maelstrom. They were wild individuals who enjoyed destruction to the point of haphazardly running straight toward dangerous situations.\nTalos granted stormriders access to several wizard spells that could be cast once per day including gust of wind, whispering wind, and lightning bolt. Once they had gained sufficient favor from Talos a stormrider could attempt to summon a storm or any other weather condition similar to the control weather spell. This could be attempted once per week.\nClear skies and generally beautiful weather had a slightly negative impact on a stormriders psyche, negatively affecting their abilities during combat, casting spells, etc.\nStormriders wore black clothing and black cloaks. Their holy symbol was worn on a chain around their neck. Their weapon of choice was a special staff made from iron and wood with a silver ball at the end."
