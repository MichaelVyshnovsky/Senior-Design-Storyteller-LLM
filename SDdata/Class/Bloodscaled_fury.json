        "mainbody": "A bloodscaled fury was a dragon that, after developing the ability to draw on their rage through other means, supernaturally honed this ability to a transcendent degree. When driven into a rage, their scales oozed with dragonblood, preternaturally increasing their might.\nMost bloodscaled furies had approached that power from the path of a barbarian but other kinds of berserkers amongst dragons gravitated towards this path, as did some sohei. The power of a bloodscaled fury bolstered its frightful presence and increased the power unlocked by its fury. Soon, a bloodscaled fury achieved the namesake ability to make the dragons blood ooze around its scales, bolstering its resistances to damage and to spells alike.\nBloodscaled furies of some experience learned how to rend anything that more than one of its claws managed to catch at the same time. More advanced furies further enhanced their rage and the defense provided by their oozing blood, making the rage last longer, managing their energy better so as to not suffer the debilitating effects of a rage ending, and finally gaining the ability to awaken a similar rage within their allies. The most experienced of bloodscaled furies gained the ability to act in bursts of blinding speed, akin to a haste spell, but without involving any magic in the process.\n* Malazan"
