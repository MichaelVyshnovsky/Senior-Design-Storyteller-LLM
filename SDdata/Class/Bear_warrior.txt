'''Bear warriors''' were crazed [[warrior]]s who adopted the [[bear]] as their [[totem]] animal.

==Culture==
The majority of these warriors were [[barbarian]]s and usually the champion of their tribe or village.

==Abilities==
Bear warriors tapped into the spirit of a bear, gaining immense strength and ferocity during combat. They could transform into a bear when enraged. Examples included [[black bear]]s, [[brown bear]]s, and [[dire bear]]s for particularly powerful bear warriors. This could happen several times per day so long as the bear warrior was enraged. They had a heightened sense of smell in either their normal form or bear form.

==Notable Bear Warriors==
[[Hagar Hlutwigsson]], a [[hagspawn]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, was a bear warrior.
