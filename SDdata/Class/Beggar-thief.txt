Beggar-thieves were among the lowest individuals of Zakharan society.Beggar-thief was a thief class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.
As the name implied, beggar-thieves were thieves. Bards were not allowed to become beggar-thieves.
These individuals focused on daily survival on the scorched streets of the Land of Fate. Their lives were dominated by hunger and basic needs. Dreams of grand adventure were just that&mdashdreams. Beggar-thieves were generally respectful of authority, assuming that the authorities had their backs turned.
Beggar-thieves had scant possessions. Those who had anything of value typically kept it hidden or stashed away to increase their chances of begging coins or food from charitable citizens.
Since there were many ragged individuals populating the streets of Zakhara, beggar-thieves had an uncanny ability to disappear in a crowd.
Beggars were regarded as the lowest members of society, negatively affecting any interaction with non-beggars.
