        "mainbody": "Stalkers were rangers that specialized in the fields of secrecy, stealth, and information gathering.\nStalkers typically took up roles as informants, spies, or interrogators.\nLike most rangers, stalkers highly valued honor, falling from grace if they ever murdered in cold blood. Owing to their emphasis on stealth, stalkers preferred a rather nondescript appearance that wouldnt draw attention to themselves, dressing like laborers or peasants. For similar reasons they avoided socializing, even that of small talk, unless directly addressed or when freely invited to express their opinion among their fellow adventurers. And they typically worked alone, eschewing animal companions that werent small and allies that werent demihuman or human, such as an aarakocra or a pixie, as either could become unnecessary distractions or draw unwanted attention.\nTheir skills in the art of stealth garnered respect from many, though it and their secrecy also made people wary of them as both were typically traits of a thief. However, in times of crisis a noble rarely hesitated to hire them and it was not uncommon for a stalker to be an enemy of a thieves guilds or an assassins guilds. Criminals and outlaws in general typically disliked them for snooping around and informing authorities.\nStalkers felt equally at home in the wilderness as they did urban areas, all the way up to the Icewind Dale region, as well as in west Faerûn in the nations of Amn\nLike any ranger, stalkers were trained in a limited degree of magic. They notably knew how to charm animals. and the ability to cast the following arcane spells — haste, protection from normal missiles, and minor spell deflection.\nStalkers were cautious and tactical combatants, preferring to surprise their opponents and strike from the shadows or wait for an opportunity to present itself, rather than rushing into conflict. They were typically proficient in weaponry that could easily be concealed, such as blowguns, daggers, darts, garrotes, short swords, slings, staves, stilettos, and sword canes. They almost never utilized shields, feeling they were awkward to use and too restrictive. In terms of armor they preferred leather, studded leather, and hide armor.\n* Valygar Corthala, an Amnian noble and stalker in the 14 century DR."
