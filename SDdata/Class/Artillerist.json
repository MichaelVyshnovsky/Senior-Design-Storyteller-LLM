        "mainbody": "rtillerists were those artificers that chose to construct and utilize magically explosive devices, such as firearms and hand-held cannons.\nThe distinct creativity and ingenuity artillerists displayed for laying pure destruction across battlefields made them highly sought after by commanders and generals across the Realms. During times of peace, they often concentrated their efforts to help prevent ongoing conflicts.\nArtillerists typically utilized a certain set of spells that they learned throughout their career. Among these were shield, thunderwave, scorching ray, shatter, fireball, wind wall, ice storm, wall of fire, cone of cold, and wall of force.\nIn addition to other tools and devices, they trained themselves in the use of woodcarvers tools. Experienced artillerists learned how to use these tools to customize arcane implements―namely rods, wands, and staves―into magical firearms to conduct spells they cast. By utilizing specific arcane sigils, these firearms dealt significantly more damage than when wielded in the hands of others.\nthumb|right|250px|A human artillerist with his flamethrower eldritch cannon.\nOne of the first unique devices artillerists learned to craft were eldritch cannons. Functioning as a type of magical ordnance, these cannons were highly customizable and could deliver destruction in a variety of different ways. Eldritch cannons could be hand-held in size, or mounted upon stands for additional stability. Types of eldritch cannons included\n* Flamethrower, which projected jets of flame outwards up to .\n* Force ballista, which shot out bolts of pure force energy to to a range of .\n* Protector, which released a pulse of positive energy that bolstered the life force of allies within a  radius.\nAs they continued throughout their careers, artillerists mastered the art of warfare utilizing their arcane cannons. They developed techniques to make their cannons more destructive, implemented self-destruction contingencies, and created fortified defenses of shimmering magical energy. Mastere artillerists were so adept at their craft, they could crew and maintain two arcane cannons at once."
