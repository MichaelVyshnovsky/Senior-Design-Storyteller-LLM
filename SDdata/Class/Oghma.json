He was still the judge of ideas and innovations, choosing which would be remembered and forgotten, but the Lord of Knowledge could not stand the suppression of any original thought, regardless of whether the consequences were good or bad. He thrived on ideas, especially new ones, and the sharing of knowledge in all its forms.\n\nIf the Wise God had a weakness, it might be his tendency to overthink things. He often concocted convoluted schemes in his head and implemented those rather than simply act directly.",
        "Description": "Although he was seldom sighted and was depicted in many different forms, Oghma's [[avatar]] most often appeared as a handsome, dark-skinned man in bright, resplendent, and stylish clothes and ornate armor more appropriate to a fantastic stage play than anywhere else. Typically, his outfit included a [[tabard]] with projecting, ornamented shoulder plates; a [[cummerbund]] with an exquisitely beautiful scene painted on its [[medallion]]-shaped [[buckle]]; and open-meshwork [[boots]] with long pointed toes that curled around and were tipped with dangling crystal teardrops that nearly touched the toes.\n\nOn very rare occasions, when battle was expected, Oghma appeared as an enormous, elderly but brawny man entirely cloaked by his long, flowing hair and beard, which was either white or black streaked with white.",
        "Personality": "While Oghma was outwardly carefree and cheerful in manner, often with a quiet humor and a ready smile, the Binder was possessed of great wisdom and could be solemn and righteous when needed. He was legendary for his geniality and all beings apart from the most evil and hateful appreciated his fine singing voice and fabled musical talents. He possessed profound powers of persuasion, using his good looks, peerless charm, and rhetorical prowess to sway even his most fierce opposition toward his point of view, and he did so at any opportunity. However, his critics—like fellow deities Lathander and Lliira, who were often radically opposed to conservatism—saw such oratory and charm as manipulative and narrow-minded. \n\nBut it was Oghma's burden to choose which ideas and thoughts would spread and which would fade away with their creator, so that all others would not be in jeopardy. Resting heavily in his heart were the experiences of millennia and hence in this duty he was serious, firmly protective, and deeply cautious. He favored a doctrine of ideological conservatism and sticking strictly to the status quo, rather than risking a rogue idea disrupting the delicate balance of knowledge he had been preserving since history began.\n\n{{fq\n| width  = 300px\n|text= Knowledge must be free to travel where it is desired.\n|source= Oghma post-[[Time of Troubles]].\n}}\n\nYet after the Spellplague, something changed in Oghma.

He often concocted convoluted schemes in his head and implemented those rather than simply act directly.",
        "Powers": {
            "Manifestations": "When Oghma did manifest, it was commonly as a blue-green radiance with an accompaniment of musical [[Wikipedia:chord (music)|chords]]. These were distinctive, being described as crawling or rising and almost menacing in their pitch.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts}} The chords never changed between manifestations and were proprietary to the Patron of Bards—any musician who dared to try play them was instantly met with a manifestation warning them to desist. Those who continued were also encircled by a ring of blue flame that could burn them, inflicting serious injuries and even death if they had angered the god enough. In any case, those who beheld the blue-green radiance had a strong feeling that were being watched. Oghma was known to speak through it in a voice that was aged, refined, and echoing and made laconic statements such as \"Well said,\" \"Tis well done,\" \"Desist from thy course, or perish,\" or \"What ye seek is to be found in...\"\n\nAn alternative manifestation was as a white light of blinding intensity. It could display a pair of eyes of blazing flames; project colored beams of force to apply magical effects; or extrude arms and hands capable of carrying items, wielding weapons, and indicating things of importance.\n\nTo aid his followers or show his approval or disapproval of their actions, the Binder could send [[golem]]s of various makes; [[metallic dragon]]s, particularly [[electrum dragon]]s; [[feystag]]s, [[translator]]s, [[Watcher (beholderkin)|watchers]] (a type of [[beholderkin]]); [[watchghost]]s, and [[lillendi]]."
        },
        "Possessions": "Oghma usually carried a [[Oghma's yarting|special yarting]] made of white [[snowwood]]. This instrument could play any tone or song flawlessly, sound like several instruments at once, and perfectly mimic any noise. Any music Oghma played from it could influence the emotions of the listener, filling them with enrapturing joy, deep despair, or uncontrollable fury. The yarting seemed to possess other magical powers that might change each time. Oghma sometimes lent it to his followers when they were carrying out some important mission for him, in which case its powers could differ from those Oghma commanded.\n\nIn battle, Oghma wielded a magical [[longsword]] known as ''[[Mortal Strike]]''. He wore ''+4 [[chainmail]]''.",
        "Tactics": "Oghma preferred to use his spells in combat, but was incredibly capable as a warrior. When he had need of a weapon, he could summon his longsword into his hand, and was highly specialized in its use. His battle-specialized avatar flew through the air hurling [[spell]]s.\n\nIn addition, he was exceptional at the sport of wrestling, being the best among the Celtic pantheon at least and their chosen champion in their battles with [[giant]]s. He would often call out foes for a wrestling match, with the loser being forced to leave the field of battle. However, his strength in wrestling was always the sum of his own strength and that of his opponent.",
        "Divine Realm": "Oghma's [[divine realm]] was known as the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]] which, contrary to its name, was actually a wilderness of old oaks and clear pools, a lonely woodland across which could be heard the echoing music of harps. The plane was dedicated not just to preserving written text in dusty scrolls, but to living, oral tales, the blessings of speech, the understanding of deep familiarity with others, and all other forms of knowledge. Oghma maintained the three magical springs scattered amidst the woods, the question-answering Spring of Knowledge, language-granting Spring of Poetry, and performance-enhancing Pool of Music, each of which changed locations at his leisure,<ref> but he spent only about half of his time in his realm.\n\nWithin the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], it was found in the [[Outlands]], also called Concordant Opposition, a [[plane]] of complete neutrality. There, it lay in the land of [[Tir na Og]]. But in the [[World Tree cosmology]], the House of Knowledge was considered a plane in its own right<ref> and in the [[World Axis cosmology]], it was a [[Astral dominion|dominion]] in the [[Astral Sea]].",
        "Activities": "Oghma much preferred quiet conversations with travelers and sages to combat.\n\nHowever, it was his role to decide what place each idea and invention had to have in the world. Oghma passed judgement on each and every new idea and innovation, determining if it should be released to the world or if it should remain with the one who formed it. Thus, he was widely viewed as the source of creativity and inspiration. He was quite protective of this duty and of the body of knowledge that was in the world.\n\nOghma loved music and the bardic arts, and so enjoyed hearing stories, poetry, and songs that he regularly adopted human form and wandered the world in search of the most talented composers and performers. When a song was sung for the first time, there was a one-in-a-hundred chance that Oghma would be in the audience. Otherwise, when a new song or story was then spread by others, there was a one-in-twenty chance the Patron of Bards would soon hear it and gift its creator with [[gold]], often via the local lord strangely choosing to bestow it. His avatars would perform the greatest ballads in all Faerun for those willing to stop and listen.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Enemies": "Oghma's most common foes were [[Mask]], patron of thieves; [[Cyric]], the god of lies; [[Talos]], the god of destruction; and [[Bane]], the god of tyranny,<ref> He saw these gods as the greatest threats to his balance of knowledge, as they all tried to lock away knowledge for their own end, corrupt it, or destroy it altogether. Oghma had also opposed the former goddess of lies, [[Leira]], and their conflicts were legend. Over the centuries, every time Leira, goddess of lies, sent revolutionary and dangerous ideas to her faithful, Oghma restricted them to remain among her small cult, thus preventing them doing harm to wider society. In the planes, the [[Lords of the Nine]] and [[Druaga]] hated Oghma for his habit of trapping fiends, but he did not fear them.",
            "Others": "Oghma's [[proxy]] was the bard [[Fial Cairbre]], who was believed to be his son.\n\nA minor servant of Oghma was the [[brass dragon]] [[Ileuthra]]. According to legend, the [[Dragon aging|great wyrm]] adored the game of chess and became so great at it that no mortal players could provide enough of a challenge. Finally, Ileuthra challenged Oghma himself to a match of three games—and handily defeated the god each time. Ileuthra then politely thanked Oghma and offered to then play a game of the god's choice. Oghma would raise Ileuthra to his servitor status and the two would continue to play chess, Ileuthra continuing to win.<ref group=\"note\">It's not specified what game Oghma challenged Ileuthra to. It may be that serving Oghma is the game, or possibly the price for losing."

        },
        "History": {
            "Time of Troubles": "When the gods were cast down to walk the Realms in mortal form during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the fate and deeds of Oghma, were, perhaps surprisingly, a matter of mystery.{{speculation}} Early on, in [[Kythorn]], one old man in [[Arabel]] fervent in his belief, insisted that Oghma had adopted the form of his [[cat]], [[Pretti]]. Supposedly the cat even talked, speaking to the man on things of great import. No one in Arabel believed him, and they were distracted by [[Tymora]]'s much more public arrival anyway.<ref><ref>\n\nMore importantly, Grand Patriarch [[Cullen Kordamant]], head of the whole Oghmanyte church and widely recognized as the Voice of Oghma, vanished without a trace from his home in [[Procampur]],{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|71}} as did much of his immediate clergy. The disappearance was a subject of much mystery and speculation. Unfortunately, answers from Oghma and other gods were confusing and contradictory, providing no clear solution. Though some thought that Kordamant simply died during the chaos, others claimed that it was actually Oghma who died, and the Grand Patriarch ascended to replace him. Some admitted the possibility that the Patriarch might be on another [[plane]] or had ascended to semi-divinity.\n\nWith the Oghmyte church left without an ultimate head, the mystery caused a growing split into rival factions, disagreeing along hierarchical and theological lines. In Procampur, the [[Orthodox Church of Oghma]] stated that Kordamant had ascended to semi-divinity and was currently serving Oghma and, until he was proven dead or the god appointed a replacement or commanded otherwise, Kordamant was still the only true Patriarch and they would not recognize any replacement. On the other hand, the [[Oghmanyte Church in Exile|Oghmanyte Church]] in [[Sembia]] and the [[Pursuers of Pure Knowledge]] in [[Mintar]] claimed that a new Patriarch had in fact already been appointed by Oghma himself, and naturally put forward their own competing candidates.  This remained unresolved more than a century later.\n\nLater, there arose a belief or heresy, depending on the faction, suggesting that Kordamant's fate had been concealed by Oghma as a test of faith for his priests, to determine whether they would hold to the quest of discovering and recording knowledge, or if they would fall prey to power struggles and reinterpretations of scripture.Many deities possessed mortal worshipers as their avatars during the Time of Troubles, so it's likely Oghma chose Kordamant for his.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Cyric created the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'', a book of great power that gave a false account of his life and twisted the reader to his faith. To counter it, Oghma collaborated with Mask, Mystra, and [[Fzoul Chembryl]] to create another book, an accurate biography titled ''[[The True Life of Cyric]]''. Both Cyric and Oghma enlisted the Zhentish scribe [[Rinda]] to write their respective books. Oghma granted Rinda an ''[[amulet of godblinding]]'' to shield her from all detection, allowing her to escape with the ''Cyrinishad'' in her care. The books were switched and ''The True Life'' read by Fzoul, revealing Cyric's treachery to the Zhents. This thwarted the schemes of the Prince of Lies, at least for the time being, but only after much of [[Zhentil Keep]] was destroyed and Mask inadvertently read the ''Cyrinishad'' and lost his power."
