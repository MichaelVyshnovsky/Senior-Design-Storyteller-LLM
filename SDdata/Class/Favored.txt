The favored were specialty priests of the Church of Tymora who were tasked by Lady Luck to provide good luck to adventurers.
These individuals spent most of their time adventuring, providing Tymoras good graces to their companions, or random strangers they met while exploring, at the same time.
Confidence surrounded the favored and rightly so, given that Tymoras blessings were indeed bountiful with them. They did not worry about the future, even when appearing to behave recklessly, because their goddess held their fate in her hands.
The favored experienced good luck so often that it appeared to be a special ability of theirs. All favored could turn undead.
The favored wore whatever armor they wished and wielded the weapon of their choice. They appeared to be normal adventurers aside from their holy symbol and a permanent smirk that rarely left their face.
