        "mainbody": "oly builders were specialty priests of the Church of Gond who excelled at invention and fixing broken things.\nHoly builders spent most of their time tinkering with items and working on designs. They often forgot to verbally preach about Gond to others, but the Wonderbringer didnt seem to mind.\nThese individuals were fascinated with every aspect of an items construction and how to improve upon it.\nHoly builders were skilled in repairing and building items, allowing them to fix or produce about twice as many items as others during a same time period.\nThese priests could not turn undead. They were easily surprised since their minds were constantly analzying the devices around them instead of paying attention to danger.\nMost holy builders wore attire more suited to blacksmiths than priests, including leather aprons and common dark work clothes which were usually stained, scorched, and generally unkempt."
