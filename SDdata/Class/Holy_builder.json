        "Activities": "Holy builders spent most of their time tinkering with items and working on designs. They often forgot to verbally preach about [[Gond]] to others, but the Wonderbringer didn't seem to mind.",
        "Culture": "These individuals were fascinated with every aspect of an item's construction and how to improve upon it.",
        "Abilities": "Holy builders were skilled in repairing and building items, allowing them to fix or produce about twice as many items as others during a same time period.\n\nThese priests could not [[turn undead]]. They were easily surprised since their minds were constantly analzying the devices around them instead of paying attention to danger.",
        "Possessions": "Most holy builders wore attire more suited to blacksmiths than priests, including [[leather]] [[apron]]s and common dark work clothes which were usually stained, scorched, and generally unkempt."
