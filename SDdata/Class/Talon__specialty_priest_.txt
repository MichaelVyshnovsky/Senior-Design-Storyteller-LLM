'''Talons''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Malar]], the Beastlord.

==Culture==
Talons were both male and female and could be any race. The vast majority of talons were [[human]], but other represented races included [[wemic]]s, [[half-orc]]s, [[half-ogre]]s, and other vile [[humanoid]]s.

==Abilities==
Talons possessed honed survival skills, allowing them to accurately identify plants, pure water, and animals. They could also track animals by their spore. They could cast several [[spell]]s on a daily basis including ''[[beast claw]]'', ''[[rage]]'', and ''[[animal transfer]]''. Talons were immune to all mind-affecting spells such as ''[[charm person]]'' if cast by a woodland creature.

==Possessions==
In addition to bludgeoning weapons, talons often wielded [[dagger]]s or [[claws of Malar]]. Claws of Malar were always a gift from the [[Church of Malar|church]]. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
