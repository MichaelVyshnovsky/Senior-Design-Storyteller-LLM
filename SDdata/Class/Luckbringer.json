        "mainbody": "Luckbringers were specialty priests devoted to Tymora, the Lady of Luck.\nThese specialty priests were both male and female and primarily halflings, though members of any race could become luckbringers.\nThey were able to use Tymoras power to increase their luck and chances for a favorable result in a single situation on a daily basis. In addition to their normal spells, holy champions could cast moment, favor of Tymora, feat, probability control, lower resistance, and luckbolt once per day. Once per tenday they could ask Tymora for divine inspiration.\nLuckbringers only wielded bludgeoning weapons. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear."
