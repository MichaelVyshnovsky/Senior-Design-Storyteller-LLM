        "mainbody": "'''Thayan knights''' were the protectors of [[Thay]]'s famed [[Red Wizards]], and leaders within Thay's armies. They were unfailingly loyal, notably knowledgeable in the ways of [[magic]] (even if they did not practice it), and extremely skilled in martial warfare.",
        "Activities": {
            "Tactics": "In battle, Thayan knights followed the orders of their Red Wizard masters, and skilled knights could anticipate such commands as well as other needs that might arise. Because of their experience in combat, wiser Red Wizards would even consult their knights on matters of strategy.\n\nA Thayan knight's primary duty was to protect their wizard superior from melee attackers, and so they never left their charge's side for long. Instead, they focused on coordinating other soldiers in battle as per their superior's wishes. If a knight did engage in close quarters combat, many were trained to survive the impact of explosive spells, allowing the Red Wizards to bombard the melee from a distance with only the knight emerging alive.\n\nBecause of the importance of their duty to protect the Red Wizards, Thayan knights almost always fought to the death, preferring to throw themselves on enemy blades than face the cruel fate that awaited those who failed this duty.{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|18}}"

        "Culture": {
            "Initiation": "[[File:Thayan_Knight_by_Wayne_Reynolds.jpg|thumb|400px|''A Thayan Knight being ordered by a Red Wizard.'']]Upon becoming a Thayan knight, an individual was adorned with a ''[[create magic tattoo|magical tattoo]]'', either on their forehead or back, that branded them as unique. Once the tattoo was completed, it made the knight unable to resist any mind-affecting magics wrought by a Red Wizard. This intimidating symbol thus marked them as completely loyal to the Red Wizards.\n\nThe most veteran of knights would have themselves marked with an additional tattoo upon their face. Some variants of these tattoos bound the knight to a specific Red Wizard, often a [[Zulkir]], and allowed them to absorb some injuries that Red Wizard would otherwise receive."
        },
        "Abilities": "Having been exposed to the innate cruelty of their homeland, Thayan knights were extremely resilient to ''[[fear]]'' on the battlefield, and could seldom be ''[[charm]]ed''. Their zeal and fervor for protecting the Red Wizards was so intense, they would surpass their normal limits when attacking any person or creature they saw attempt to harm one of the crimson-robed [[mage]]s. Due to their conditioning to serve unfailingly, Thayan knights found it much more difficult to fight or to resist the [[spell]]s of a Red Wizard.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it became more common for Thayan knights to also be trained in spellcasting. Their spells focused on protecting their charges&mdash;such as with ''[[protection from evil and good]]''&mdash;and smiting their enemies&mdash;such as with ''[[thunderous smite]]'', ''[[branding smite]]'', or ''[[blinding smite]]''. They also enhanced their existing abilities to inspire allies and intimidate enemies with magical auras.{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|30-31}}",
        "Possessions": "Most Thayan knights were equipped with [[enchanted]] [[full plate]] armor and a ''[[cloak of resistance]]''. They wielded [[longsword]]s, [[composite shortbow]]s, and metal [[shield]]s, which were also often enchanted or at least of fine craftsmanship. Most carried a handful of [[potion]]s.\n\nWhile skill with the longsword was expected if not mandatory, Thayan knights were also skilled with a wide variety of weapons. The [[glaive]] was also a popular option.",
        "Notable Thayan Knights": "[[File:Ivy Enclave.jpg|thumb|350px|''A pair of Thayan knights guarding a Red Wizard within a Thayan enclave.'']]\n* [[Savvis Daal]], overseer of the Red Wizards' slave pits at the [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|Thayan enclave]] in [[Proskur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Oscillok]], a servant of Zulkir [[Ethra Dralas]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|10}}\n* [[Arzel Phen]], a defender of the Thayan enclave in Proskur in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Nular Rhyn]], the bodyguard and advisor of the Red Wizard [[Chathin Zurn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Magnus Varn]], the bodyguard and messenger of the Red Wizard [[Torisk Haut]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Azar Vrask]], another defender of the Thayan enclave in Proskur in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR."
