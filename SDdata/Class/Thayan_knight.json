        "mainbody": "century DR.\nThayan knights were the protectors of Thays famed Red Wizards, and leaders within Thays armies. They were unfailingly loyal, notably knowledgeable in the ways of magic (even if they did not practice it), and extremely skilled in martial warfare.\nThese warriors acted as commanding officers of Thayan soldiers, defenders of Thayan enclaves all over Faer√ªn, and as personal bodyguards to Red Wizards. They were knights only in name, as they did not have any code of conduct. The only rule to which they adhered was that their life was of no importance compared to the safety of the Red Wizards, whom they were sworn to protect.\nOutside of battle, Thayan knights shadowed their Red Wizard charges and maintained a constant vigilance. They were known to project a stern and intimidating presence.\nIn battle, Thayan knights followed the orders of their Red Wizard masters, and skilled knights could anticipate such commands as well as other needs that might arise. Because of their experience in combat, wiser Red Wizards would even consult their knights on matters of strategy.\nA Thayan knights primary duty was to protect their wizard superior from melee attackers, and so they never left their charges side for long. Instead, they focused on coordinating other soldiers in battle as per their superiors wishes. If a knight did engage in close quarters combat, many were trained to survive the impact of explosive spells, allowing the Red Wizards to bombard the melee from a distance with only the knight emerging alive.\nBecause of the importance of their duty to protect the Red Wizards, Thayan knights almost always fought to the death, preferring to throw themselves on enemy blades than face the cruel fate that awaited those who failed this duty.\nTo become a Thayan knight, a skilled human warrior had to be born in Thay, possess significant martial abilities, and swear absolute allegiance to the Red Wizards. Non-humans were prohibited from joining their ranks as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, but this prohibition had been relaxed as of the late 15 century DR.\nDiscipline and obedience were paramount characteristics in a Thayan knight, who were expected to focus on defending the Red Wizards at all costs. As a result, warriors trained in the ways of barbarians were not considered eligible, but fighters and the occasional monk or ranger were.\nthumb|400px|A Thayan Knight being ordered by a Red Wizard.Upon becoming a Thayan knight, an individual was adorned with a magical tattoo, either on their forehead or back, that branded them as unique. Once the tattoo was completed, it made the knight unable to resist any mind-affecting magics wrought by a Red Wizard. This intimidating symbol thus marked them as completely loyal to the Red Wizards.\nThe most veteran of knights would have themselves marked with an additional tattoo upon their face. Some variants of these tattoos bound the knight to a specific Red Wizard, often a Zulkir, and allowed them to absorb some injuries that Red Wizard would otherwise receive.\nHaving been exposed to the innate cruelty of their homeland, Thayan knights were extremely resilient to fear on the battlefield, and could seldom be charmed. Their zeal and fervor for protecting the Red Wizards was so intense, they would surpass their normal limits when attacking any person or creature they saw attempt to harm one of the crimson-robed mages. Due to their conditioning to serve unfailingly, Thayan knights found it much more difficult to fight or to resist the spells of a Red Wizard.\nIn the late 15 century DR, it became more common for Thayan knights to also be trained in spellcasting. Their spells focused on protecting their charges&mdashsuch as with protection from evil and good&mdashand smiting their enemies&mdashsuch as with thunderous smite, branding smite, or blinding smite. They also enhanced their existing abilities to inspire allies and intimidate enemies with magical auras.\nMost Thayan knights were equipped with enchanted full plate armor and a cloak of resistance. They wielded longswords, composite shortbows, and metal shields, which were also often enchanted or at least of fine craftsmanship. Most carried a handful of potions.\nWhile skill with the longsword was expected if not mandatory, Thayan knights were also skilled with a wide variety of weapons. The glaive was also a popular option.\nthumb|350px|A pair of Thayan knights guarding a Red Wizard within a Thayan enclave.\n* Savvis Daal, overseer of the Red Wizards slave pits at the Thayan enclave in Proskur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n* Oscillok, a servant of Zulkir Ethra Dralas in the late 15 century DR.\n* Arzel Phen, a defender of the Thayan enclave in Proskur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n* Nular Rhyn, the bodyguard and advisor of the Red Wizard Chathin Zurn in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n* Magnus Varn, the bodyguard and messenger of the Red Wizard Torisk Haut in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n* Azar Vrask, another defender of the Thayan enclave in Proskur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR."
