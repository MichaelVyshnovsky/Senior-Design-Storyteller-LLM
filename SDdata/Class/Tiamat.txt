'''Tiamat''' ({{Pronounce|TEE|a|mat|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}} {{Pronounce|TEE|a|maht|refs= and later [[Asmodeus]]. Before entering the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], she was a member of the [[Draconic pantheon]],

Tiamat was also the eternal rival of her brother [[Bahamut]], ruler of the good [[metallic dragon]]s.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
[[File:Tiamat 3e.png|thumb|''Tiamat's humanoid avatar form.'']]
Tiamat was a unique [[chromatic dragon]], who had one head for each primary color of the most common species of chromatics ([[black dragon|black]], [[blue dragon|blue]], [[green dragon|green]], [[red dragon|red]], [[white dragon|white]]). Each head was able to operate entirely independently of each other and had the powers of a member of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body also had traits in common with a [[wyvern]], including a long tail tipped with a venomous stinger.

She also had three main avatars. ''The Dark Lady'' was a [[mulan]] woman with long dark hair and completely black eyes. She always wore dark robes and frequently had a seductive smile on her face.

''The Chromatic Dragon'' was a dragon with stubby legs and five heads that could be any combination of head belonging to a chromatic dragon, the skin of each merged into three stripes -- blue-green, gray and purple before they merged again into brown skin that covered her tail. Sometimes, ''The Chromatic Dragon'' appeared in the form of [[Tchazzar]] when manifesting in [[Chessenta]]. ''The Undying Queen'' was a [[dracolich]] version of ''The Chromatic Dragon''.

Tiamat had three manifestations in [[Avernus]] as well, one of which never left the gate to [[Dis]]. Her manifestation as [[Azharul]]{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)/Tiamat's Many Homes}} was her other 'public' face used for when foes challenged her to combat, meanwhile her original body remained secluded in her lair.

==Personality==
Tiamat was arrogant, greedy, hateful, spiteful and vain. She never forgave any kind of slight and was focused on obtaining more power and wealth. She disdained mortals, regarding them as mere disposable tools in her schemes. When needed, she was charming and fey, but her self-serving and reptilian personality betrayed her sooner or later.

After having experienced relative mortality as an archfiend, she became less reckless but also paranoid.

Tiamat enjoyed the company of dragons, and had many great wyrm consorts of the chromatic varieties.

She had an insatiable greed for treasures, but preferred that her followers brought it to her in the form of gifts instead of searching for riches on her own.

==Powers==
[[File:Tiamat p93.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tiamat as the Chromatic Dragon]]As a unique type of chromatic dragon with the traits of the five most common chromatic varieties, Tiamat was a foe to be reckoned with in battle.

Along with all the standard powers and godly senses of a deity of her rank, those who saw her fight claimed that her heads were able to cooperate in battle, and that those heads had the ability to use the breath weapons and spell-like abilities common to their species. Although her sheer size prevented claw and kick attacks while on the ground, she was adept at their use while flying. She also had a stinger on her tail that injected a powerful venom on her foes, killing them in agonizing pain.

==Realm==
When she was part of the Untheric pantheon, Tiamat had a realm in [[Zigguraxus]]. She also had a lair in Avernus, on the [[Nine Hells]], known as ''[[Tiamat's Lair]]''.

After the dissolution of the Untheric pantheon, her realm was the ''Dragonspawn Pits of Azharul'', a realm she obtained after having killed Azharul and renamed into the ''[[Cave of Greed]]''. It was located in the [[Dragon Eyrie]] lowest region, and she somehow connected it to her lair in Avernus.

She was reputed to have a realm in [[Heliopolis]] but in fact that was a hoax Tiamat used in hopes of confusing her enemies.

==Activities==
Tiamat wanted to take control of the Realms, and even as she was thwarted again and again by her enemies, she didn't give up. She had a particular interest in controlling [[Unther]] and Chessenta, and after the [[Spellplague]], she also had interest in [[Murghôm]], [[Tymanther]], and the dragon empires of [[Laerakond]]. She didn't like to leave her lair, however, and usually acted to advance her agenda by using members of her Church or her agents in the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

Tiamat kept an active watch over evil dragonkind and always stirred them to further actions of avarice, pride and wickedness.

As of [[1491 DR]], however, her primary goal was to break free from the Nine Hells.

==Relationships==
[[Image:tiamat1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Cult of Tiamat'', by [[Wayne Reynolds]]]]Tiamat was the antithesis of her brother Bahamut, as both of them represented opposing values,

Being a member of certain pantheons made her some other enemies. She conflicted with [[Iyachtu Xvim]] as he was the only significant opposition to her joining the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], then later with his father, Bane. She also counted [[Ilmater]] among her enemies.

Having once been an [[archfiend]] living on Avernus, Tiamat was loosely allied with [[Bel]] and lent him many [[Abishai]] to fight in the [[Blood War]]. She resented [[Mammon]] for converting some evil dragons away from her. She helped [[Asmodeus]] forge his ''[[Ruby Rod of Asmodeus|Ruby Rod]]''. She developed an enmity with Asmodeus and the archdevil Bel after they betrayed her.

She maintained a consort from each of the chromatic dragon races. She urged her evil dragonblood followers to populate the world and fill it with her spawn

Inhabitants of the [[Outer Planes]] noted that Tiamat was extremely similar to Takhisis, a major goddess worshiped on the world of [[Krynn]]. Both appeared as five-headed dragons with an alternate form as a "Dark Lady" and had similar personas and portfolios. Some planar inhabitants claimed they were the same goddess and others that they were as different as night and day, while still others said one was a reflection or avatar of the other. All these theories might have had a bit of truth, but the reality remained unknown.<ref> Takhisis did, however, maintain a separate [[divine realm]] from Tiamat known as Abthalom, or the Nether Reaches, also in Avernus in [[Baator]].<ref>

== Worshipers ==
{{Quote|Many mouths speak your hunger into this world, mistress. Let me be the loudest.|A basic prayer to Tiamat.}}[[File:Tiamat symbol.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[unholy symbol]] of Tiamat.]]
Tiamat had a reputation amongst the people of the state of [[Unther]] for battling with the other members of their pantheon and was blamed for every one of the many setbacks Unther experienced. This later became an advantage when Gilgeam's behavior served to foment rebellion against him and those rebels began to worship her, eventually creating an organized church.

Tiamat had made inroads into the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and claimed some members as her worshipers. Also, for fifteen years, the [[House Karanok|Karanok]] family of [[Luthcheq]] unwittingly served Tiamat while they were worshiping the [[primordial]] [[Entropy]]. Tiamat transformed Entropy into a conduit for her power and gained the Karanoks as pawns.

Many evil dragons have worshiped Tiamat since their species first appeared on Toril, and kobolds believed she was their creator, and although they didn't worship her as god, they revered her as their creator. After the Spellplague, she also gained a few dragonborn followers.

===Clergy===
Tiamat accepted only evil clerics. They, like Tiamat herself, sought to place the world under the domination of evil dragons.

===Church of Tiamat===
{{main|Church of Tiamat}}
[[File:Tiamat MtG.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Followers of Tiamat praising their goddess]]
The church of Tiamat was regimented by a strict hierarchy of ranks and titles. Her clerics were occupied by the twin tasks of acquiring an ever-increasing hoard of wealth for the faith and sabotaging the faiths of other deities. As a result, they occupied most of their time with an unending series of thefts, assassinations, acts of vandalism, and arson. In Unther and Chessenta they were primarily concerned with seizing as much power as possible, while in western Faerun, the cult's agents were focused on subverting the Cult of the Dragon.

==History==
For ages, sages debated whether Tiamat actually was a deity or not. Many believed she was the archetype of evil dragonkind, a [[devil]] or [[demon]], the avatar of another deity or even a mortal dragon so powerful that chromatic dragons revered her as their queen and creator. Whatever she was, sages knew for certain that she was powerful and worshiped by evil dragons as a goddess.

===Origins===
According to sages of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Tiamat was actually a goddess. She came into existence alongside the rest of the draconic pantheon when the first dragons were born.

Her origins were highly conflicting, however, as there were many accounts about how she came into being. In the more commonly accepted traditions, she was the daughter of Asgorath and sister of Bahamut and [[Null]]; According to the ancient draconic myth ''[[Elegy for the First World]]'', Bahamut and Tiamat both coalesced from the primordial chaos at the beginning of time.

Whatever the truth, her cult grew rapidly in the communities of chromatic dragons, especially among blue, green, and red dragons.

===Creation of the First World===
According to ''Elegy for the First World'', after Bahamut and Tiamat awakened from the primeval chaos they partnered and worked together to create a world. This world was known as the Prime Material plane, but in the poem was known as the ''First World''. After the creation of the ''First World'', they created the dragon god [[Sardior]] to help them to create the rest of the dragonkind: the first [[metallic dragon|metallic]] and [[chromatic dragon]]s. When the gods of the Outer Planes came to invade the ''First World'', Tiamat resisted and opposed them even after Bahamut was defeated. She was eventually defeated by the combined might of the gods and sealed away in "a prison of darkness".

===Imprisonment in the Nine Hells===
According to myths, the [[Thousand Year War]] ended as a result of a curse that struck Tiamat after she slew an unknown giant [[deity]]. Tiamat was doomed to become a prisoner in Avernus, only able to leave the plane if summoned by a powerful ritual. Other accounts say that Tiamat was sent to the Nine Hells as a punishment for opposing the gods when they first came to the Material Plane, while other accounts even say that Tiamat went to the Hells by her own choice.

===The Dragonfall Wars===
Once dragons as a race had established themselves during the [[Time of Dragons]], the various religious factions of dragons began to battle one another over their different ideologies. Over time, religious fervor waned and draconic philosophers came to the conclusion that gods who allowed such behavior were not worthy of their worship. This started the draconic apathy toward their gods which lasted for thousands of years. However, the hatred that had developed between Tiamat, Bahamut and their followers was so intense that they refused to stop fighting. Their conflict came to be known as the [[Dragonfall War]]. During the first years of the war, Tiamat bred horrific and aberrant draconic creatures known as the [[dragonspawn|Spawn of Tiamat]], in an attempt to wipe out the followers of Bahamut.

The war waxed and waned in intensity, with the last era of intense fighting occurring between {{Yearlink|-2087}} and {{Yearlink|-1071}}.

Now that both Bahamut (who had become a member of the Untheric pantheon under the alias of [[Marduk]]) and Tiamat had humanoid worshipers, the Dragonfall War entered into a new period of intensity. The two siblings fought each other personally, with neither being able to gain the upper hand. Tiamat also worked against the other Untheric gods, with the result of the church of [[Enlil]] naming her the "Nemesis of the Gods" and blaming her for every problem the nation had.

Then, in −1071 DR in a fight of the [[Orcgate Wars]] known as the [[Battle of the Gods]], Tiamat saw an opportunity to slay [[Gilgeam]] while he was battling [[Ilneval]]. However, Marduk intercepted her and in the ensuing battle they killed each other. With both of their Untheric aspects dead, Tiamat and Bahamut were both stripped of their divine power. Tiamat was reduced to the status of an [[archfiend]], her last few followers in Unther not enough to allow her to remain even as a lesser deity. However, as Gilgeam became a tyrannical God-King, the people of Unther never forgot the Nemesis of the Gods and they increasingly turned to her in secret for succor.

As an archfiend, she was given rulership of Avernus by [[Asmodeus]]. Her job was to prevent outcast devils on that layer of [[Nine Hells|Hell]] from becoming a threat but performed so poorly that Asmodeus demoted her. Knowing her failure was not deliberate (by reading her thoughts), Asmodeus deigned to allow Tiamat to remain in Avernus unpunished, and even gave her a chance to regain her position if she impressed him in her new role as the guardian of the main gate to [[Dis]].

===Rise of the Dragon Queen===
[[Image:TiamatVsGilgeam.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Gilgeam battles Tiamat'', by [[Dana Knutson]]]]This state of affairs lasted until [[1346 DR]] when some Untherite cultists managed to summon another aspect of Tiamat to [[Toril]]. This aspect, known as ''the Dark Lady'', fomented rebellion all over Unther against the church of Gilgeam. Gilgeam was so hated that the membership in her own church swelled, and Tiamat was elevated to status of a [[demigod]]dess. She also took the opportunity to influence the lich [[Sammaster]] and his Cult of the Dragon into tracking down the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]''.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], after [[Ao]] banished the gods from the [[Great Wheel cosmology|planes]], ''the'' ''Dark Lady'' was transformed back into her three-headed Untheric avatar, which was promptly slain by [[Gilgeam]]'s. three powerful chromatic dragons. Tchazzar devoured the other two, combining the three essences and ushering in the reappearance of Tiamat's more powerful five-headed form, which she used to kill Gilgeam and therefore cause Ao to dissolve the Untheric pantheon completely.

Having attained the status of a lesser deity once again, she was able to manifest avatars once more, until one of them was destroyed in [[1359 DR]] by King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] who had been tasked by Bahamut to destroy the Wand of Orcus in her heartsblood. Having done so, the king of [[Damara]] also brought the worship of Bahamut back to his people, elevating Bahamut to the status of lesser deity and rekindling the Dragonfall War once more. In response, Tiamat unleashed her aberrant dragonspawn and many of her followers to Vaasa to make trouble for the Church of Bahamut in Damara, while gaining some followers among disaffected members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the process. This time, however, the Platinum Dragon countered them by reviving the ancient race known as the [[dragonborn of Bahamut]].

She projected her wishes through the transformed primordial [[Entropy]], and while in this guise expanded her base of humanoid worshipers. She eventually joined the Faerûnian pantheon in [[1371 DR]] after gaining the worship of a cult in [[Luthcheq]]. Tiamat's body had been suffering from aches and pains that had been growing worse over time, but her elevation back to deity-hood reinvigorated her. However, the relative mortality she had experienced as an archfiend made her less reckless and more paranoid. She misinformed her clergy that she no longer resided in Avernus, but instead maintained a grand divine realm in [[Heliopolis]].

When members of the [[Twisted Rune]] discovered that her only asset in Heliopolis was a disturbed [[lichnee]] [[netherese]] [[archwizard]], known as the [[Listener]], they attempted to steal his magic.  In retaliation, Tiamat manifested an aspect that defeated the intruders and forced them to kill the minor draconic deity [[Azharul]] in his home in [[Dragon Eyrie]]. With the Listener and the Twisted Rune's forced help, Tiamat subsumed Azharul, taking his body and divine realm, completely unbeknownst to anyone but herself. All the while, she had already begun creating her real divine realm in the mountains of Avernus.

In [[1373 DR]], Sammaster managed to alter the ''Dracorage mythal'' to cause permanent insanity in all dragons unless they allowed themselves to become dracoliches. In one of the worst dracorages ever seen on Toril, Tiamat resurrected Tchazzar, Gestaniius and Skuthosiin to act as emissaries which she would use to solidify and expand her power base in Chessenta, [[Mulhorand]], [[Threskel]], and Unther.

After the destruction of Sammaster and the end of the [[High Magic]] that sustained the ''Dracorage mythal'', she had to withstand an invasion launched by Bahamut on her demesne in [[Dragon Eyrie]].

The destruction of the ''Dracorage mythal'' also heralded the prophesied "[[Draconic pantheon#Turning of the Great Cycle|Turning of the Great Cycle]]" which sparked off the religious fervor lacking in dragons since the beginning of the Dragonfall War, and Tiamat gained new draconic converts. In [[1374 DR]], lightning and meteor showers pounded Faerûn, and Bahamut and Tiamat instructed their respective followers to seek out specific sites that would each contain some form of dragon egg. Unfortunately for Bahamut, Tiamat's followers were much more effective in retrieving the eggs than his own. Tiamat's followers brought the eggs they collected to [[Unthalass]] in preparation for a new battle of the Dragonfall War.

Tiamat spent her new forces mostly in her efforts to conquer the east, but that task proved more difficult than she envisioned. Only Tchazzar met with success, cementing his rule in Chessenta while Unther was conquered by Mulhorand. Her tentative ally [[Alasklerbanbastos]] also ruled Threskel and allowed Tiamat's church to establish a stronghold there. A short-lived but powerful cult of humanoid fanatics was also lost to her in the [[Wyrmbones]].

Her losses outweighed her gains, however: during the Spellplague, Entropy ceased being a simple vessel for communication and spells, taking away her power base in Luthcheq. The dissolution of her subsumed realm in [[Dragon Eyrie]] during the Spellplague also saw the badly-wounded body of Azharul fall into the hands of Bane. In [[1479]], Tchazzar managed to conquer Threskel for himself, but this just drew him into a war with the Abeiran nation of [[Tymanther]] in which he was killed.

With her most powerful servant dead, her forces beginning to crumble and Bahamut's power increasing after he became the subservient god of [[Torm]], the Dragonfall War stalled. In [[Banehold]], Bane discovered that Azharul was merely a vessel for Tiamat and enslaved it. Furious but overwhelmed by other events, Tiamat did not immediately retaliate against her enemy, instead serving Bane loyally despite his harassment. During this period, Tiamat discovered Bane's secrets and passed them on to Asmodeus. 

Some time in the next decade, Tiamat saw an opportunity and took it, wrenching Azharul out of Banehold along with much of Bane's divine energy. She used that energy to mend Azharul's broken body and increase her own divine power. Delighted, Asmodeus offered her the rulership of Avernus once more. However, to avoid disappointing Asmodeus again and to prevent a conflict with [[Bel]], Tiamat refused, instead offering to be Asmodeus' champion and devouring all who opposed him (and offering covert aid to [[Zariel]] to prevent Bel from becoming too powerful).

Yet agreements in the Hells are binding, and Tiamat was subsequently placed under the direct compulsion of Bel. Her brief attempt at resistance allowed her to see into Bel's mind and learn of the directions Asmodeus had given him to imprison her in her divine realm to prevent her from becoming ambitious.{{cite book/The Rise of Tiamat|79,85}} he and his forces were ultimately defeated and Tiamat was banished back to the Nine Hells.<ref>{{cite book/Storm King's Thunder|7}}
