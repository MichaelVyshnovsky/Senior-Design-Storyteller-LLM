        "mainbody": "pecialty priests of Yondalla were worshipers of Yondalla, the Protector of Halflings, within Luiren in the Shining South.\nThese individuals were always halflings. These specialty priests did not exist prior to the Time of Troubles.\nThey could not turn undead like normal priests. These specialty priests were extremely skilled at throwing rocks as weapons, throwing quickly with a great degree of accuracy. They could cast magic stone once per day. They were adept at blending in with their surroundings in natural environments. They could shapechange similar to a druid, but only into mammals that burrowed into the earth.\nThey were permitted to wield non-edged weapons with the only exception being the short sword. Favored weapons included the sling and simply throwing rocks. They wore leather armor or no armor."
