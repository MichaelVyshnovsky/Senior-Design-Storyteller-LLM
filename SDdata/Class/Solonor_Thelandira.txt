Solonor Thelandira () was the elven god of hunting, archery, and survival in wild and harsh places. He taught his followers the arts of hunting including archery, moving unseen, and hiding in the wild places. He watched over the borders of wilderness and farmed land and sought to maintain the balance between them. Solonor lived in the realm of Arvandor on the plane of Arborea.
Solonor manifested as a lean and muscular male elf clad in a cloak of leaves. Wolf, a Beast Totem Spirit worshiped by wild elves, was often depicted at the side of Solonor in religious iconography.
