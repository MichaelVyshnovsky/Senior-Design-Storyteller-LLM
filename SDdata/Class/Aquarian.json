        "mainbody": "quarians were specialty priests devoted to Deep Sashelas, the Lord of the Undersea.\nAll aquarians were aquatic elves, half-sea elves, or malenti.\nThey could turn underwater undead, such as lacedons, like normal priests. However, their turning skill suffered when used against terrestrial undead. They excelled in combat against sahuagin. All aquarians had an intuitive understanding of how to speak and understand the Dolphin language.\nIn addition to their normal spells, aquarians could cast surface sojourn, charm person, summon cetacean, and divination once per day. They could cast cetacean form twice per day and conjure water elemental twice per tenday.\nAquarians wielded tridents, nets, spears, daggers, knives, or a special underwater crossbow. For armor they wore either sea elven scale mail or sea elven shell mail."
