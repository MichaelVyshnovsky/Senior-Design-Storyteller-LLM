'''Lei Kung''', also known as the '''Duke of Thunder''' or the '''Thunder God''', was a minor god of thunder and vengeance who served the [[Celestial Emperor]] in the [[Celestial Empire]], the dominant religion of [[Kara-Tur]], particularly [[Shou Lung]].Many of the [[deities]] detailed in ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' and ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' were referred to simply by their titles, expecting readers to infer which deities in ''[[Legends & Lore]]'' they were intended to be. Lei Kung is assumed to be the same deity as the "Thunder God" detailed in those sourcebooks, as they share the same [[portfolio]]s and are punishers of wrongdoers. 

==Avatar==
Lei Kung's avatar was an ugly brute with blue that were red and spotted with a span of {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}. He was typically clad in only a [[belt]] and [[loincloth]], but sometimes wore ''+3 [[plate mail]]''.

==Personality==
Lei Kung was a vicious, vengeful, and and malicious individual. He had infamous tantrums. And he derived enjoyment from inflicting pain upon wrongdoing mortals and [[spirit]]s alike. This sadism was so strong, that if he ever ran out of deserving victims Lei Kung would resort to going after those who were merely accused of wrongdoing, whether those accusations were true or false.

==Abilities==
The avatar of Lei Kung was impervious to harm from attacks based around [[water]], electrity, or thunderous sound. It could cast [[druid]]ic [[spell]]s, but only those from the [[elemental sphere|elemental]] or [[weather sphere|weather]] [[sphere]]s.

==Possessions==
Lei Kung possessed an [[enchanted]] pair of [[drum]]s, green in coloration, that he hung from his belt. When struck, these drums unleashed an effect similar to a ''[[horn of blasting]]'' and ''[[drums of panic]]''. He also typically carried around a [[hammer]] and a [[chisel]], which he used as weapons to strike criminals dead. The former unleashed electricity upon those it struck and had a ''+4'' enchantment.

==Activities==
Lei Kung had several duties as a deity in the Celestial Empire. He was in charge of thunder during storms, making foul weather at the request of other members of the Celestial Empire in order to teach their worshipers a lesson. He delighted in windstorms that destroyed beautiful or valuable things of fragile quality.

More importantly, when instructed to do so by the [[Celestial Emperor]], Lei Kung punished those who committed crimes not governed by mortal law and hunted down [[evil]] spirits that dominated mortal bodies, such as the wicked [[hu hsien]]. Regardless of whether they were a mortal or spirit, Lei Kung brutally punished wrongdoers the same.

==Realm==
He resided in the [[plane]] of [[Acheron]], on the layer of [[Avalas]]. where he rested in when not out doing his duties. The roads of this realm were paved in dark red bricks and were lit by bright green [[lantern]]s.

Being the only divine realm in Acheron not devoted to war, Resounding Thunder acted as a sanctuary for the many deserters, traitors, and cowardly individuals who would flee from the ongoing wars between [[Gruumsh]] and [[Maglubiyet]]. Such individuals would convert to his faith and devote their time to defending his borders, gaining the allegiance of others, or scouting for approaching armies.<ref>

Whenever the [[Great Modron March]] made its scheduled sojourn through the Avalas layer of Acheron, Lei Kung guaranteed the [[modron]]s safe passage through Resounding Thunder.<ref>

==Worshipers==
The [[priest]]s of Kei Lung's faith typically wielded hammers and [[javelin]]s. They wore black leather as part of their priestly vestments. They also had skills like that of a [[thief]] and access to spells from the [[All sphere|all]], [[Combat sphere|combat]], elemental, [[Sun sphere|sun]], and weather spheres.

His priests dedicated their lives to ferreting out the misdeeds of others, even minor ones. To this end, they often worked as informers or spies, but were sometimes asked to assist Lei Kung in tracking down spirits that had assumed the form of a man. It was deemed sometimes permissible for a cleric of Lei Kung to attribute false misdeeds to their enemies, though doing so was considered a minor misdeed and thus had to be done in secrecy.

On the [[Kara-Turan calendar]], Kei Lung had a holy day on the month of Kao II.
