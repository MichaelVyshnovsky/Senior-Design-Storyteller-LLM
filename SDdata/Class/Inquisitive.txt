'''Inquisitives''' were [[rogue]]s that specialized in discovering truths in the world, by uncovering secrets and solving puzzles of the unknown.

==Culture==
These individuals were highly valued among the leadership of the [[Waterdhavian]] adventuring company [[Acquisitions Incorporated]].

==Abilities==
These rogues finely honed their ability to process the words and actions of others. They excelled at deductive reasoning, had masterful attention to detail, and let no clue go unexamined. Inquisitives learned to readily identify any lie they heard in conversation.

They specialized in fighting off creatures that preyed upon the innocent and obscured their presence among everyday folk. They trained themselves to see through [[illusion]] and obfuscation and to strike true against hidden enemies such as [[shapechanger]]s.

Their senses became so finely tuned, inquisitives could discern an opponent's weaknesses in battle and strike against where they were most vulnerable.
