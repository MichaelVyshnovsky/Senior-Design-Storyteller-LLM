'''Shadow stalkers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Eshowdow]], the Shadow Giant within the [[Chultan pantheon]].

==Activities==
Shadow stalkers were involved in planning the downfall of the [[Tabaxi (tribe)|tabaxi]].

==Culture==
Shadow stalkers were always [[human]]s of [[Eshowe]] descent. They all participated in the ''[[summon shadow spirit]]'' incantation upon becoming a shadow stalker. They composed approximately one third of Eshowdow's [[Eshewtak]], holding prominent roles over other members of the clergy.

==Abilities==
They were skilled at remaining hidden within shadows similar to a [[thief]]. They could cast the following [[spell]]s once per day: ''[[spook]]'', ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'', ''[[spirit armor]]'', ''[[wraithform]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[shadow monsters]]'', ''[[shadow magic]]'', ''[[demi-shadow monsters]]'', ''[[shades]]'', ''[[demi-shadow magic]]'', ''[[shadow walk]]'', and ''[[shadowform]]''. The strength or weakness of these spells was directly affected by the lighting conditions present when they were cast, with darker conditions making them stronger or more difficult to resist.

==Possessions==
They used a variety of weapons including [[hand axe]]s, [[blowgun]]s, [[club]]s, ''[[kerrie]]'', [[machete]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[spear]]s, and ''[[yklwa]]s''. [[Armor]] usually consisted of [[Hide armor|dinosaur hide]], Eshowe [[scale mail]], or [[leather armor]].
