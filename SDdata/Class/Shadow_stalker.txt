Shadow stalkers were specialty priests devoted to Eshowdow, the Shadow Giant within the Chultan pantheon.
Shadow stalkers were involved in planning the downfall of the tabaxi.
Shadow stalkers were always humans of Eshowe descent. They all participated in the summon shadow spirit incantation upon becoming a shadow stalker. They composed approximately one third of Eshowdows Eshewtak, holding prominent roles over other members of the clergy.
They were skilled at remaining hidden within shadows similar to a thief. They could cast the following spells once per day spook, darkness, 15 radius, spirit armor, wraithform, fear, shadow monsters, shadow magic, demi-shadow monsters, shades, demi-shadow magic, shadow walk, and shadowform. The strength or weakness of these spells was directly affected by the lighting conditions present when they were cast, with darker conditions making them stronger or more difficult to resist.
They used a variety of weapons including hand axes, blowguns, clubs, kerrie, machetes, scimitars, spears, and yklwas. Armor usually consisted of dinosaur hide, Eshowe scale mail, or leather armor.
