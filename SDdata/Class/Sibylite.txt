Sibylites were specialty priests devoted to Savras, the All-Seeing One.
They spent much of their time in meditation seeking glimpses of the future.
In addition to divine magic spells, all sibylites could cast arcane spells from the divination school. Instead of memorizing these spells like a wizard, a sibylite would pray for them.
They gained a number of special powers depending on their advancement including augury, clairvoyance, detect lie, cure blindness, true seeing, magic font, reflecting pool, and consequence.
All sibylites eventually became immune to being surprised during combat or sneaked up on. Especially powerful sibylites could automatically perceive a targets true form regardless of any cloaking spells.
Sibylites did not wear armor, but could wield any bludgeoning weapon of their choice.
