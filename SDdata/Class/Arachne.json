The arachne called upon Lolths power only to dominate everyone else in drow society.\nArachne were able to summon hairy spiders as familiars, and skilled arachne could see through the eyes of their familiars. In addition, experienced arachne were able to use giant spiders as a mounts. These clerics, when they become skilled enough, were able to create types of undead known as zin-carla. These undead could be commanded by the arachne themselves, and would carry out their will. These spellcasters of the greatest power became divine in nature and effectively immortal. They could also assume the shape of yochlols, the closest minions of Lolth."
