In addition, experienced arachne were able to use [[giant spider]]s as a mounts. These clerics, when they become skilled enough, were able to create types of [[undead]] known as [[zin-carla]]. These undead could be commanded by the arachne themselves, and would carry out their will. These spellcasters of the greatest power became divine in nature and effectively immortal. They could also assume the shape of [[yochlol]]s, the closest minions of Lolth."
