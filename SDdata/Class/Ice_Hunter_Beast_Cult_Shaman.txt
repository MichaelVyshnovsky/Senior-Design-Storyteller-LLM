All ice hunter shamans could summon common forms of their totem animals to their clans base twice every tenday. They could shapechange into their totem animal twice per tenday.

They typically wore leather or hide armor and never carried a shield. Some weapons favored by nakurits included the short bow, dagger, ritiik, spear, trident, and iuak.
