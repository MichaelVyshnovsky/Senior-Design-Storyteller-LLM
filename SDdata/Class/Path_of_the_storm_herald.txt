The '''path of the storm herald''' was a [[primal path]] taken by [[barbarian]]s who chose to channel the [[primal magic]] of nature into their bodies during a [[rage]]. Individual barbarians that took this path in life were known as '''storm heralds'''.

==Description==
While in their rage, a storm herald became a tempest of natural magic, which swirled around their body in a dramatic display.

==Culture==
They were among the highest-regarded barbarians of their given tribes. They often trained in understanding and harnessing primal magic alongside [[ranger]]s and [[druid]]s.

Some among their ranks chose to dwell in the harshest and most remote locations, such as isolated glaciers, barren deserts, and storm-wracked coastal lands.

==Abilities==
Early during their training, storm heralds learned to create an aura around their body that resembled a magical tempest. This aura behaved differently depending on the habitat with which the barbarian most closely identified. Heralds of the deserts conjured blistering heat, while those who harnessed the power of icy tundra solicited ice spirits to their aid.

As a barbarian's very [[soul]] became closer in tune with nature, they acquired inner strength and resilience to the elements.

The most powerful storm heralds could harness their storm auras to the greatest effect. They could extend their own elemental resilience to others and even turn their auras on their foes. Heralds of the sea could use their aura to knock down enemies as if struck by a wave, while those from the cold lands could freeze them where they stood.
