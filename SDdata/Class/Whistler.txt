'''Whistlers''' were special [[halfling]] [[bard]]s found commonly in [[Luiren]] in the [[Shining South]].

==Requirements==
Only halfling bards could be whistlers.

==Role==
Whistlers served as special guardians for halfling settlements in Luiren. Nearly every village or hamlet had a least one whistler to help protect them from harm. They often worked together with [[cleric]]s of [[Yondalla]].

==Skills==
Through whistling their unique songs, whistlers were able to summon and control animals, control plants, and even control the weather.
