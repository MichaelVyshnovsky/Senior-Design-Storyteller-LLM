        "mainbody": "Thuldor were specialty priests devoted to Laduguer, the Gray Protector.\nThe vast majority of thuldor were gray dwarves, but members of all of the dwarf races, both male and female, could become a thuldar.\nThuldor were skilled herbalists and animal handlers. Many were also psionicists. Laduguers blessing made it harder to strike thuldor in combat while also making it slightly easier for them to resist the effects of magic, poison, etc.\nIn addition to their normal spells, thuldor could cast darkness, strength of stone, slow poison, meld into stone, stone shape, stoneskin, wall of stone, and stone tell on a daily basis. Additionally, a thuldar could cast find traps at will and turn pebble to boulder, to include the reverse of the spell, twice per day.\nThuldor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the armor they were allowed to wear."
