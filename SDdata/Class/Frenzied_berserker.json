        "mainbody": "Frenzied berserkers were warriors who enhanced their fighting abilities by entering a self-damaging frenzy. \nFrenzied berserkers sought out conflict to fulfill their need for the thrill of battle. It was like an addictive drug for them—they constantly sought out more fighting to feed their craving. Because of their traditional love for battle, barbarians were the ones who most frequently adopted the fighting style of frenzied berserkers. Spellcasters, of course, rarely became frenzied berserkers.\nLeather armor and headpieces made from animals were associated with frenzied berserkers.\nThese warriors could perform powerful attacks and kill their enemies in quick succession. They were also physically tougher than most people. Their power attacks and cleaving were more effective than those of other warriors.\nFrenzied berserkers were able to enter a state of frenzy that increased their strength but also the chance of them being hit. While frenzied, they could perform attacks quickly. However, being in this state was exhausting, with the berserker suffering physically until the end of the frenzy. Furthermore, any injury could trigger the frenzy and it took a great act of will to snap themselves out of it early.\nThe strongest frenzied berserkers were even able to delay their death while in a frenzy. They could also make others enter a frenzy who werent trained in their arts.\nFrenzied berserkers had an easier time learning intimidation, survival, and parrying skills. They were also known for their high fortitude. \nPractitioners of this combat style could be found in many different regions of Faerûn around 1374 DR.\n* Lorne Starling, a human fighter from West Harbor on the Sword Coast North and an agent of Black Garius during the Shadow War in the late 14 century DR."
