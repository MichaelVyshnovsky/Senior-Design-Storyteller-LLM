        "mainbody": "Whistlers were special halfling bards found commonly in Luiren in the Shining South.\nOnly halfling bards could be whistlers.\nWhistlers served as special guardians for halfling settlements in Luiren. Nearly every village or hamlet had a least one whistler to help protect them from harm. They often worked together with clerics of Yondalla.\nThrough whistling their unique songs, whistlers were able to summon and control animals, control plants, and even control the weather."
