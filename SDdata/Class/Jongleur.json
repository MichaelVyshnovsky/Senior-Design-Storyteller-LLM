        "mainbody": "'''Jongleurs''' were a form of traveling entertainer that entertained audiences through their skills in a variety of forms of acrobatics and juggling.",
        "Culture": "These entertainers were typically found accompanying carnivals or circuses, as well part of a traveling troupe. They often performed in clubs or taverns, though occasionally some desperate jongleurs performed on the streets. Sometimes jongleurs took up the life of an [[adventurer]], often acting as scouts for a group.\n\nIn the Realms, jongleurs could particularly be found in [[the Dalelands]]<ref> and all throughout the city of [[Waterdeep]].<ref> They could also potentially be found in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Speculation}}<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/110/Living City Character Generation|24}}<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/134/Living City: Character Creation Guidelines|27}}<ref group=\"note\">[[Polyhedron 110|''Polyhedron'' #110, \"Living City Character Generation,\"]] an article on character creation for the RPGA [[The Living City|Living City]] Campaign, did not have jongleurs listed among the [[character kit]]s from ''[[The Complete Bard's Handbook]]'' as an acceptable option for [[bard]]s. While a later article on character creation, \"Making a Living\" from [[Polyhedron 134|''Polyhedron'' #134]], noted that jongleurs were an acceptable bard kit for the setting. Whether or not this meant jongleurs were canonically present in Ravens Bluff is a manner of speculation.",
        "Abilities": "Jongleurs were masters at manipulating [[jugglables|small items]] with their hands, being capable of catching and juggling almost anything. They could even utilize this to deflect some weapons thrown towards them. and squeeze into tight places.\n\nThough not typical of the profession, some jongleurs were noted as being proficient in poetry and the use of [[rope]]s",
        "Possessions": "Jongleurs tended to dress in flashy colors, though not to the garish degree typical of [[jester]]s, and avoided garments that could tangle or get caught, such as large [[cape]]s and [[robe]]s. Adventuring jongleurs typically wore lightweight armor that wouldn't restrict their acrobatic abilities. These included [[leather armor|leather]], [[studded leather armor|studded leather]], [[padded armor|padded]], and [[elven chain mail]].\n\nIn terms of weaponry, jongleurs fought with anything that could be thrown or utilized in their performances. The latter included [[polearm]]s, [[quarterstaff|quarterstaves]], [[sling]]s, [[staff sling]]s, and [[whip]]s."
