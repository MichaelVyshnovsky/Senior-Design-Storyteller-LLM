        "mainbody": "Shadow magic sorcerers of the Realms drew their power directly from the Shadowfell. Their connection with that plane or the dark entities that dwelled within differed with each practitioner. Some claimed lineage from a denizen of Shadowfell, while others may have directly been influenced by its malign energies.\nThese sorcerers were viewed by some organizations as ideal infiltrators, spies, and most of all hired assassins.\nWhatever the origin of their connection, shadow magic sorcerers regularly manifested peculiar quirks of their behavior or character. Some individuals were entirely cold to the touch, while others rarely (if ever) bled or in some cases, blinked but once a tenday. A few particularly macabre sorcerers could not for the life of them remember there were inherent differences between the living and the dead.\nShadow magic sorcerers did however have access to tremendous arcane powers. They felt quite comfortable in the darkness, armed with potent darkvision that extended outwards for  and the ability to conjure darkness around them. By their nature, their existence was one that straddled both life and death simultaneously. As such, they recovered more often from mortal wounds and were exceptionally difficult to truly kill.\nThose sorcerers that honed their connection to the Shadowfell and its magic could walk through shadows.\nMaster shadow magic sorcerers learned how to temporarily transform their physical form into that of pure shadows. While in their umbral form, sorcerers became highly resistance to damage and forms of magical energy (save for radiant) and could pass through solid objects as will."
