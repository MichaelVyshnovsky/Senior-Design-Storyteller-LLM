'''Holy justices''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Tyr]], the Even-Handed.

==Culture==
These specialty priests could be male or female and were primarily [[human]]s. They were well-versed in the laws and customs of their place of birth and wherever they lived.

==Abilities==
In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, holy justices could cast ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[strength of one]]'', ''[[memory read]]'', ''[[legal thoughts]]'', and ''[[holy word]]'' on a daily basis. They could ''[[detect lie]]s'' and ''[[see invisibility]]'' at will and impose ''[[impeding permission]]'' once per [[tenday]]. The effects of any spell from the [[law sphere]] cast by a holy justice were particularly difficult to resist. They practiced their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat, similar to warriors.

==Possessions==
In addition to bludgeoning weapons, holy justices often wielded [[longsword]]s or [[bastard sword]]s. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
