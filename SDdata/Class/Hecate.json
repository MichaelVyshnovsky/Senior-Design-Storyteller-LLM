        "Hear me, then, mortals. I desire a simple deed, easily done, and well rewarded... Should you succeed, your reward will be great. If you fail... well, it’s been a long time since I’ve burned anyone alive. It might be fun.\n|Hecate.\n}}": "=Description==",
        "mainbody": "r true form was that of a three-headed woman with a gorgeous body, milk white skin, scarlet nails, and eyes that burned like embers. She wore a deep red dress. Her [[avatar]] could take on almost any form, but she typically appeared as a beautiful woman with lustrous, dark hair.",
        "Description": "Her true form was that of a three-headed woman with a gorgeous body, milk white skin, scarlet nails, and eyes that burned like embers. She wore a deep red dress. Her [[avatar]] could take on almost any form, but she typically appeared as a beautiful woman with lustrous, dark hair.",
        "Personality": "Hecate was an enigmatic goddess whose motivations and methodology have always been unclear. At times her behavior seemed to be in accordance to [[lawful evil]], with greater tendencies towards the former. Some claimed that her movements were governed by ancient laws she adhered to despite the lack of any clear schedule, and her preference for kinds of magic notably changed with the nightly weather. At others times however she was noted to be independent and capricous, a [[chaotic evil]] goddess that got what she wanted, and that in fact it was her mood which caused the weather to change. She was patron of those who used magic for their benefit, promoting its use in both [[spell]] and [[magical item|item]] form and the idea that it was the key to all desirable things.\n\nHer exact ethics aside, Hecate's morality was mystifying in general, seemingly at odds with a being of [[evil]]. She often hindered mortals just because she had nothing better to do, but would also help them by the same principle. She was a defender of children who, on rare occassion, would notice and exact vengeance on people who harmed them, and sometimes appeared at night to lonely shepherds to defend their flocks. Those who unknowingly traveled on while she was (on whatever she considered \"her night\") were attacked by her hounds, but if the beasts were held off she would call them back and perhaps even offer recompense to her victims.\n\nIn any case, Hecate was an incredibly dangerous and deceptive goddess. She was widely famed for her cutting wit and great eloquence, with some even claiming she was the one who taught [[Apollo]] his oratory skills. Few could detect the plans she put in motion as she played champions like instruments, but she could prove neglectful to the consequences of her actions (even regarding divine beings) after losing interest.",
        "Powers": "Hecate was capable of casting any spell accessible to [[magic-user]]s, especially those of the [[illusionist]] [[school of magic]], as often as she liked without any restriction. She was also capable of controlling [[undead]].",
        "Possessions": "Hecate's personal weapon was a ''+5 [[dagger]]'' with the ''[[ghost touch]]'' [[weapon quality]]. She also possessed the legendary eye of [[Gruumsh]], which had been believed lost in his conflict with [[Corellon]].\n\nTwin ''[[Sphere of annihilation|spheres of annihilation]]'' were by her side at all times, ready to be used against her enemies. They moved by themselves after being started and could not be controlled by mortals.",
        "Realm": {
            "Hades": "The Aeaea of Hades was in a constant state of night, though what kind of night depended on the whims and moods of Hecate,\n\nThe domain was quite hilly, with omens and portents around every corner. It had groves of [[poplar]] trees, which Hecate's most faithful petitioners were said to gather during full moons to perform arcane rites. There were meandering roads, lined with poplars, that lead and came from nowhere. And minor villages lay scattered about the realm, with more appearing along the roads that didn't remain long-term. Hecate herself had no fixed palace within the domain, though maintained a lighthouse of ancient construction on the outer fringe.\n\nThere were no restrictions on spellcasting within this domain, allowing every spell cast therein to work with maximum efficiency. However, Hecate was aware of every spell cast within her domain and determined whether or not they had their desired effect. On clear nights she allowed most spells to succeed. On stormy nights she favored those casting flashy and destructive spells.",
            "Nine Hells": "The Aeaea of Minauros was smaller compared to Hecate's divine realm in Pluton. \n\nThe validity of their claims was questionable, but it was known that they fed [[soul]]s to the machines, converting them into divine and sorcerous energy that would be used by both Hecate and her minions. These devices were also capable of consuming other entities, such as extraplanar beings and mortals. Whenever supplies ran low, the lowliest of her servants would be fed to the machines.\n\nThis Aeaea had also been described as a blackened and charred realm featuring rivers of [[fire]] and volcanoes as far as the eye could see. Within one of these volcanic craters sat a throne of [[obsidian]], studded in [[fire opal]]s, upon which Hecate sat. The environment changed to reflect her mood, volcanoes erupting and fires flaring to signify her dissatisfaction or exasperation. This description is derived from ''Tales of the Outer Planes'' and ''Manual of the Planes 1st edition'', which posited that her realm was in the [[fire]]-dominant plane of Phlegethos."
        },
        "Activities": "Hecate spent some of her time crafting evil, magical items with the aid of her clerics, which she would trade with [[baatezu]] for souls to power the machines in her divine realm in Minauros. or her domain of Aeaea, accompanied by a pack of hell hounds. While doing so her avatar would sometimes aid children, herders, and shepherds on a whim. But most times she would send her hounds to attack those who dared to travel on the same night as her and if they managed to fend the hounds off for some time she would call them back. On rare occasions, she would offer the traveler some form of recompense.",
        "Relationships": "Hecate had nine hell hound servants that she would unleash to hunt down anyone that desecrated her temples or attacked her higher ranking [[cleric]]s. Occasionally she would simply sic them on those traveling at night.\n\nHecate had no allies among the various deities, with the exception of [[Persephone]]\n\nShe was one of the [[Lower Planes]] deities that had strategic alliances with [[Asmodeus]], lord of the Nine Hells.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "The doctrine of Hecate's church was that finding and holding power was the primary goal of all life,{{Cite dragon/153/Following in their Footsteps|30}} and that the ideal path to achieving power, wealth, and practically all desirable things was magic. She taught the joys of abundance but also warned against the folly of wastefulness, teaching that a good harvester, whether of crops or wildlife, left some behind for next year.",
            "Rituals": "Clerics of Hecate wore blue-white garments, a color akin to moonlight. Her temples were well hidden, often located in the depths of dark haunted forests and guarded by the undead. Each month, clerics of Hecate would make their sacrifices to her under the night of a full moon, often in the form of black [[sheep|ewes]] and [[honey]]. Failure to do so would result in her depriving the worshiper of their magical powers until the proper sacrifice was made.\n\nAll of Hecate's clerics had a special rapport with hell hounds and would never be attacked by them."
        },
        "History": "Hecate was born to a pair of [[greater titan]]s.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note6\">Not to be confused with the [[dawn titan]]s or the [[true giant]] race known simply as the [[titan]]s. Some believed these greater titans were known as [[Crius]] and [[Eurybia]], while others claimed her parentage lied with ones named [[Asterie]] and [[Perses]].\n\nShe had some unclear history of dealings with the [[Norse pantheon|Norse deity]] known as [[Loki]]. \n\nOver the years she was served faithfully by a mortal, [[human]] sorceress named [[Circe]]. After many years of faithful service they came to a mutual agreement that she deserved a raise in power, thus she promoted Circe to the full status of a [[proxy]].\n\nIn approximately [[1357 DR]],{{LliiraImprisonment}} Hecate grew infatuated with the deity [[Enki]], but at the time he was in a relationship with the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian deity]] [[Lliira]]. Unwilling to let this get in her way, she [[curse]]d Lliira so that she could return no man's love and imprisoned her in a \"Pleasure Palace\" called Zannibar on an unnamed world. Hecate eventually lost the feelings she felt for Enki, but neglected to remove the curse she had placed upon Lliira.\n\nLater that same year she sent her [[jester]] out to the [[World Serpent Inn]] to acquire some suitable [[adventurer]]s to obtain her [[Wild Hunt hound|a hound from the]] [[Wild Hunt]], wanting to crossbreed it with her [[hell hound]]s. As the adventurers were guided through the planes by the jester and got caught up in other transactions they learned of Lliira's fate. They went on to free the goddess from her imprisonment, offering the captured hound to Hecate in return for her removing the curse."
