'''Silvermaids''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Lurue]], the Unicorn Queen. As with all of Lurue's clergy, silvermaids were always female [[human]]s, [[half-elves]], or [[elves]].

==Activities==
Silvermaids provided aid and comfort to those in need. They were particularly fond of helping those with grand dreams and aspirations. Many silvermaids were filled with wanderlust and roamed across [[Faer√ªn]].

==Abilities==
These women were not only skilled horseback riders, but also at riding both [[unicorn]]s and [[pegasi]]. They could ''[[speak with animals]]'' at will. Lurue protected them from all forms of poison and death [[spell]]s, and they could never be magically ''[[Charm person|charmed]]'' or ''[[Hold person|held]]''.

Silvermaids gained a number of magical abilities depending on their skill including ''[[remove blindness or deafness]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[dance of the unicorns]]'', ''[[negative plane protection]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'' by touch, and ''[[teleport without error]]''. These powers could be used once per day.

Those silvermaids truly pure of heart could summon a loyal unicorn companion. The unicorn would serve as the silvermaid's mount and friend for its entire life provided the silvermaid never fell out of favor with Lurue. If the unicorn was slain for any reason Lurue would hesitate before granting the silvermaid another such companion.

==Possessions==
Silvermaids were not restricted with the weapons they used during combat, but all were trained in both the [[longsword]] and [[lance]]. With regards to [[armor]] the heaviest mail they could wear was [[chainmail]]. Many also carried a polished [[shield]].

==Relationships==
Many silvermaids were served by a [[familiar]] similar to [[wizard]]s. Their familiars were able to speak the silvermaid's native tongue.
