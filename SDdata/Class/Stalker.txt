'''Stalkers''' were [[ranger]]s that specialized in the fields of secrecy, stealth, and information gathering.

==Activities==
Stalkers typically took up roles as informants, spies, or interrogators.

==Culture==
Like most rangers, stalkers highly valued honor, falling from grace if they ever murdered in cold blood. Owing to their emphasis on stealth, stalkers preferred a rather nondescript appearance that wouldn't draw attention to themselves, dressing like laborers or peasants. For similar reasons they avoided socializing, even that of small talk, unless directly addressed or when freely invited to express their opinion among their fellow [[adventurer]]s. And they typically worked alone, eschewing [[animal companion]]s that weren't small and allies that weren't [[demihuman]] or [[human]], such as an [[aarakocra]] or a [[pixie]], as either could become unnecessary distractions or draw unwanted attention.

Their skills in the art of stealth garnered respect from many, though it and their secrecy also made people wary of them as both were typically traits of a [[thief]]. However, in times of crisis a noble rarely hesitated to hire them and it was not uncommon for a stalker to be an enemy of a [[thieves' guild]]s or an [[:category:Assassins guilds|assassin's guild]]s. Criminals and outlaws in general typically disliked them for snooping around and informing authorities.

Stalkers felt equally at home in the wilderness as they did urban areas, all the way up to the [[Icewind Dale]] region, as well as in [[west Faerûn]] in the nations of [[Amn]]

==Abilities==
Like any ranger, stalkers were trained in a limited degree of [[magic]]. They notably knew how to ''[[charm animals]]''. and the ability to cast the following [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]]s — ''[[haste]]'', ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', and ''[[minor spell deflection]]''.

==Combat==
Stalkers were cautious and tactical combatants, preferring to surprise their opponents and strike from the shadows or wait for an opportunity to present itself, rather than rushing into conflict. They were typically proficient in weaponry that could easily be concealed, such as [[blowgun]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s, [[garrote]]s, [[short sword]]s, [[sling]]s, [[staves]], [[stiletto]]s, and [[sword cane]]s. They almost never utilized [[shield]]s, feeling they were awkward to use and too restrictive. In terms of armor they preferred [[leather armor|leather]], [[studded leather]], and [[hide armor]].

==Notable Stalkers==
* [[Valygar Corthala]], an [[Amn]]ian noble and stalker in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
