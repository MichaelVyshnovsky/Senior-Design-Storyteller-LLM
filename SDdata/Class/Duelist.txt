A duelist, also called a swashbuckler, was an elite warrior who focused on precious, acrobatic skill, and agility.
Duelists preferred to wander alone, often seeking adventure or a scheme to get rich fast. Sometimes, they operated in small, close-knit bands that used teamwork tactics.
A duelist specialized in wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon designed to pierce rather slash or bludgeon, typically a rapier. They did not don armor or carry shields, which interfered with their abilities.
A would-be duelist trained to dodge blows, to be mobile in battle, and to wield a weapon with finesse. They were also skilled at tumbling, and had some talent in performance.
Duelists used speed and coordination in a deadly blend with their intelligence to become capable fighters. They employed nimble footwork wits and reflexes and a good eye to strike with precision. They preferred to avoid getting hit instead of wearing armor or relying on resilience to take blows.
A canny defender, a duelist used their own wits and intellect to adopt the best defense, rather than rely on armor or a shield. A duelist could move around a battle with ease, evading opportunistic blows against them. With elaborate parrying, an experienced duelist on the defensive was skilled at deflecting attacks and could even knock aside arrows and other projectiles aimed at them.
A duelist had increasingly quick reactions when a fight broke out. They also had greater reflexes and grace, provided they were not encumbered by armor or a shield.
Striking with precision, a duelist could do extra injury to a living creature, at least one with obvious anatomy.
A duelist could use their agility to charge acrobatically across terrains that other fighters would find impossible. Chairs, tables, stairs, swinging on chandeliers all were useful to a duelist who needed to get to the enemy as quickly as possible.
