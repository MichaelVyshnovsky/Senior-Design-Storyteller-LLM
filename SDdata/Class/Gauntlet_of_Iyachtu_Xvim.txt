A '''gauntlet of Iyachtu Xvim''' was a [[specialty priest]] of the [[Church of Iyachtu Xvim]]. They were fanatics who bullied followers of others faiths, with special focus on those of [[Cyric]].<ref name="WaPotR-p82" >

==Activities==
These miscreants devoted all of the time and energy into spreading strife and hatred to those they encountered.

==Culture==
Gauntlets prided themselves on their assistance in [[Iyachtu Xvim]]'s rise in power, spreading hatred and tyranny among their god's rivals. Though homicidal and fanatical, the gauntlets were highly organized and disciplined and adhered to a strict hierarchy. Many were previously [[priest]]s of Cyric who left the faith after Cyric's betrayal of [[Zhentil Keep]].

==Abilities==
These individuals could [[Turn undead|turn]] and [[command undead]]. They were immune to all forms of ''[[fear]]''. Gauntlets could usually easily determine if someone was a Cyricist just by looking at them.

Gauntlets could not cast any beneficial [[spell]]s from the [[healing sphere]] or [[necromantic sphere]] with the exception of ''[[cure light wounds]]''.

==Possessions==
Gauntlets wore black [[armor]] such as [[chainmail]] or [[plate mail]]. They favored black [[helmet]]s and black [[cloak]]s and cowls with forest green trim. They could wield any weapon of their choice, but were required to carry one bladed weapon and one blunt weapon.

==Relationships==
Gauntlets and followers of Cyric attacked each other on site with homicidal frenzy.
