The '''Coronal Guard''', whose members were known as '''''armathors''''' in [[Elven language|Elven]], was a tradition of [[swordmage]]s in late-15{{th}}-century [[Faerûn]], built upon the foundations of [[eladrin]] culture. Skilled warriors armed with a graceful and cultured combination of [[arcane magic]] and [[sword]]play, Coronal Guards were among the greatest of swordmages and among the first to defend the ancient city of [[Myth Drannor]], from which their style initially originated.

==Culture==
Since the [[Crown Wars]], eladrin had widely practiced [[arcane magic]] and combined its use with that of a [[longsword]]. From these meshes of arcane and martial skill, some of the first swordmages emerged, who would go on to become some of the greatest warriors the world had ever seen. Of these empires, [[Cormanthyr]] was among the strongest and to protect its [[coronal]]s the eladrin of Cormanthyr developed an elite class of swordmages, whose loyalty to their liege was unquestionable. These early swordmages of Cormanthyr, like the modern Coronal Guard, were known as ''armathors'' and it is from their heritage that the Coronal Guard of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] drew inspiration from.

However, the ancient order that once protected Cormanthyr was no more. During the [[Weeping War]], the ancient nation was obliterated in a single night and the vast majority of armathors were slain protecting the capital of Myth Drannor. However, though the guardians of the coronals were no more, the skills and traditions that defined them were not lost. The few remaining armathors passed on what they knew to others, allowing the Coronal Guard to survive, albeit in a reduced form. Through this, the tradition spread to other lands, such as [[Evermeet]] or [[Luruar]], where it gained followers and practitioners. Most recently, with the reclamation of Myth Drannor by the [[sun elves]] of Evermeet, the tradition returned from exile to its original home, some of its followers banding together to form the [[Coronal Guard of the City of Song]]. However, while many or perhaps most Coronal Guard were affiliated with this new order, not all were and across Faerûn the tradition had many imitators and learners, demonstrating its strength and longevity.

==Abilities==
The traditions of the Coronal Guard granted a number of useful abilities to their followers. All Coronal Guard were versed in the [[abjuration]] school to some degree, knowing how to shield themselves against enemy assault at a moment's notice through their magic. Armathors could also use this affinity for defensive magic to increase their body's own vitality, so that even if an attack pierced their wards, it would be less deadly to them. Some of the most experienced swordmages of the armathor's path could increase their ability to deflect or avoid damage by an even more impressive degree, often by freeing one of their hands to reinforce the ward.

Coronal Guard [[spell]]s focused partially upon interrupting enemy attacks or redirecting their movements. ''[[Countering thunderclap]]'', for instance, used a blast of sonic energy to push an enemy backwards. Another spell, ''[[avaunt foe]]'', similarly allowed an armathor to [[teleportation|teleport]] an opponent from one spot to another.
