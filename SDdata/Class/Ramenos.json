        "He demands manling, of course! It has been too long. After that, the maw will be sated for many seasons. The fish will be plentiful! To be food for the maw is an honor indeed.\n|A bullywug chieftain to a soon-to-be sacrifice to Ramenos.<ref name": "\"TF\"/>",
        "mainbody": "",
        "Description": "Ramenos's true form was unimaginably massive, his innards alone estimated to be about ten miles in length and his mouth always open to intake more food. His [[avatar]] took the form of a bloated, {{SI|20|ft}} tall frog with vast, {{SI|10|ft}} wide maw.",
        "Powers": "When manifested as an avatar, Ramenos's fought by leaping forward about {{SI|15|ft}} while crushing his opponent underneath his corpulence or simply consuming his foe whole and allowing them to be digested, although a trapped enemy could still slice the avatar's insides. Every few minutes he could belch out a massive, inebriating gas that would leave those caught within physically and mentally handicapped for up to twenty minutes. He was able to use [[evocation]] magic and was immune to [[illusion]]s and [[phantasm]]s.",
        "Divine Realm": "Ramenos dwelt in a hollow tree on the 74{{th}} [[layers of the Abyss|layer of the Abyss]], [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 74: Smaragd|Smaragd]], a vivid jungle filled with poisonous [[frog]]s, venomous [[snake]]s, layers of jungle canopies and fermenting toxicants. It was a relatively non-hostile region of the [[Abyss]], its dangers coming more from the environment, such as the heat or acid rain.",
        "Activities": "Ramenos spent all his time in a drunken stupor hibernating within his tree, completely uncaring about the fate of his worshipers and barely interested in his own. He sent no signs and only manifested avatars if they were summoned.",
        "Relationships": "Ramenos did possess a consort in the [[slaad lord]] Urae-Naas. Her current appearance was that of a morbidly obese [[slaad]] capable of moving only by crawling and whose tongue lolled out until it practically touched the ground.\n\nRamenos shared Smaragd with another dormant deity, the [[yuan-ti]] god and [[World Serpent]] [[aspect]] [[Merrshaulk]] to whom he was possibly related.",
        "Worshipers": "Although he once had other worshipers, Ramenos was eventually left only with followers among the bullywugs He lacked [[cleric]]s and his [[shaman]]s were weak and simplistic. Fortunately, Ramenos's poor support of his people was offset by the few duties of his shamans, who were only required to assist their tribal chiefs, likely relatives, and regularly partake in plant alkaloids,\n\nBullwugs that worshiped Ramenos did not necessarily have anything more than the shallowest of understandings of him. They were known to placate him hoping for food, and some believed he manifested himself as certain locations, such as his mouth being a lake.<ref name =\"TF\"/>",
        "History": "Once active and capable, Ramenos's thoughtless pleasure seeking had led to his decline, his power and standing having deteriorated alongside that of his worshipers. His temples were nothing but forgotten ruins amid deep jungles and atop lonely plateaus, with great stone statues of him and his open mouth awaiting sacrifices dominating the open areas. Aside from powerful [[gate]] magic, only by performing ancient rituals in such abandoned areas could his avatars be called.\n\nRamenos was once the god of the [[batrachi]], one of the [[Creator Races]], but sometime after {{Yearlink|-31000}} the batrachi left [[Toril]] due to an event known as the [[seven-turn winter]] that had driven them to near extinction. From the plane of [[Limbo]], home of the slaad, they established the [[Supreme Throne]] and Ramenos altered them for at least the second time to serve his agenda.\n\nEventually Ramenos was left only with the bullywugs, the regressed descendants of the batrachi and races of proto-amphibians, as his followers. It was possible that Ramenos could no longer properly recollect his past at some point, and the bullywugs themselves were completely unaware of such events, lacking any but the most basic creation myths centered around their own limited scope of themselves and their environment.\n\nEventually Ramenos's self-destructive behavior proved fatal, and his corpse was used to create a new Abyssal layer by Urae-Naas in which to create slaad tadpoles. His entrails were repurposed and used to form the tunnel system and internment facility that was the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 53: Phage Breeding Grounds|Phage Breeding Grounds]], the relatively small but nonetheless grotesque, 53{{rd}} layer of the Abyss."
