        "mainbody": "Platinum knights were devoted to the Platinum Dragon Bahamut, Lord of Good Dragons. Swearing allegiance to their deity, they worked to defend noble and benevolent dragonkind from the evil chromatic dragons.\nThey worked with dragons, celestials, and paladin orders and ally themselves with any morally upstanding individuals that wished to oppose evil dragons, especially those associated with Tiamat.\nPlatinum knights stood bold in the face of fierce dragons and were immune to their frightening presence. Veteran knights were stoic champions of dragonkind. Over time their skin hardened and took on the gleam of metallic dragon scales, offering them a form of natural armor. \nBahamuts grace shielded platinum knights and bestowed upon them power as they smote evil dragons. The most exalted among them were said to be able to see all things as they truly were.\n* Innerdain Justdark, a half-silver dragon member of the Talons of Justice."
