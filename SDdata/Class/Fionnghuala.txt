'''Fionnghuala''' ({{Pronounce|fin|ell|ah|refs=The in-universe language for this translation is not given in the source; however, in the real world, [[wikipedia:Fionnghuala|Fionnghuala]] was a common [[wikipedia:Irish language|Irish]] name in older times. In the Forgotten Realms, this would most likely place it in one of the [[Waelan]] languages, such as [[Druidic language|Druidic]].

==Description==
As a mortal, Fionnghuala was a small, petite [[human]] woman with red hair and green eyes.

Fionnghuala's armor was gossamer, and she wore white feathers on her shoulders and as a crown. 

==Personality==
Fionnghuala was brave, selfless, and virtuous. She was devoted to the cause of the Seelie Court and to that of the sorority of swanmays and was always ready to defend the [[fey|faerie folk]], killing to defend them if need be.

==Powers==
Fionnghuala was nigh impossible to surprise. She was immune to [[Paralyze|paralysis]] and petrification. No avian creature would ever harm her.

Fionnghuala had the fey powers to send a [[Whispering wind|whispered message on the wind]] and could convince any small animals to deliver messages for her as well.

Her most notable ability, as a swanmay, was being able to turn into a giant swan. She had the ability to [[Polymorph|turn anyone else into a swan]] also.

==Possessions==
She bore a magical white feather, a gift from Titania and the source of her fey powers. Her weapons were a magical [[longsword]] that could [[heal]] her daily and a magical [[longbow]] with a quiver of [[flight arrows]].

==Divine Realm==
Fionnghuala shared the same [[divine realm]] as other members of the Seelie Court, which had no permanent location but instead wandered from plane to plane, from the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] to [[Arborea]] to [[Ysgard]].

==Activities==
Titania sometimes used her magic to send one of Fionnghuala's avatars on missions throughout the [[planes of existence]]. She often visited the meetings of the sisterhood of swanmays, and she patrolled the borders of faerie lands seeking out evil to stop.

==Relationships==
Because her interests kept her away from sylvan realms more than other fey deities, Fionnghuala was considered a member of Titania and [[Oberon]]'s Outer Circle. She was very close friends with the [[giant]] goddess [[Iallanis]].

Fionnghuala was one of the few persons the [[unicorn]] god [[Eachthighern]] allowed to ride him. More commonly, however, she simply flew alongside him in her swan form.

She was counted as one of [[Aerdrie Faenya]]'s allies, as well as that of [[Solonor Thelandira]] and [[Baervan Wildwanderer]].

==Worshipers==
Fionnghuala was the patron of swanmays, and they all revered her, but most had allegiances to other gods as well. Her followers believed in the power of communication and sorority and were always good. Like other sylvan gods, she did not grant spells to her followers, nor did she have priests or [[cleric]]s, for all fey creatures had magical powers of their own. Her [[holy symbol]] was a white feather.

==History==
Fionnghuala was once a mortal woman with a great love of the fey people. She sacrificed her life to defend the fey during the most recent great war between the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]]'s forces and the Seelie Court, taking a last stand to defend [[Oberon]]'s sorely wounded avatar.

In reward for her selfless bravery and sacrifice, Oberon raised her from the dead and made her a demigod, while Titania offered her the magic white feather that transformed her into a part-fey being and made her into the very first swanmay. Throughout the centuries, similar shared feathers have continued to transform noble female [[druid]]s and rangers into members of the swanmay sorority.
