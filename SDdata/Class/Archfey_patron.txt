An '''archfey patron''' was one possible sponsor for a [[warlock]]. If a bargain was made between a warlock and one of the [[archfey]], the warlock's patron gave them access to certain powers, including a suite of [[spell]]s.

Novice warlocks that were sponsored by an archfey patron had access to ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[calm emotions]]'', and ''[[phantasmal force]]''. These warlocks, if they were somewhat experienced could cast ''[[blink]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[dominate beast]]'', and ''[[greater invisibility]]''. Master warlocks under the sponsor of an archfey could even cast ''[[dominate person]]'' and ''[[seeming]]''.
