'''Greenlords''' and '''greenladies''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Silvanus]] who passionately defended flora and fauna, often to the detriment of nearby civilized regions.<ref name="WaPotR-p107" >

==Activities==
Greenlords viewed any mark of civilization as an affront to [[Silvanus]], including roads and cultivated land. They carefully monitored civilized expansion to ensure it did not encroach too far into the wild. They would visit towns and cities if needed, but preferred to spend their time in the wild.

==Culture==
Though they did not despise [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s, a greenlord's actions did favor flora and fauna instead.

==Abilities==
A greenlord could ''[[speak with animals]]'' and ''[[Speak with plants|plants]]'' three times per day. They could also transform into an animal of their choosing on a daily basis.

Given the perverse nature of the [[undead]] and a greenlord's close tie with living things, they risked being temporarily petrified with fear when encountering them. A greenlord could not [[turn undead]].

==Possessions==
Greenlords wore [[leather armor]] decorated with intricate carvings, usually in the form of leaf motifs. They also wore forest green [[cloak]]s, [[bronze]] neck torcs embedded with green [[gemstone]]s, and a tan tunic. For weaponry they preferred a wooden [[quarterstaff]].
