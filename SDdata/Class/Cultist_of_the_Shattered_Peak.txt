A '''Cultist of the Shattered Peak''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Shattered Peak]], a secret society whose members were all of [[Netherese]] descent.

==History==
Cultists were always [[human]]s of Netherese descent.  These bloodlines are most prevalent in the [[Anauroch|Anauroch Desert]], [[Halruaa]], [[Nimbral]], on the [[Sword Coast North]], in [[the Ride]], among the [[Uthgardt]], and in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Organization==
Most members were originally [[fighter]]/[[rogue]]s, though single-class rogues and rogue/[[ranger]]s have also been known to join the cult's ranks.  [[Paladin]]s are rare due to the cult's sometimes ruthless tactics, and arcane spellcasters are banned altogether. They were also required to speak [[Loross]].

===Goals and methods===
The cultists recalled the arcane hubris that was Netheril's downfall, not to mention its oppression of nonhumans, and fought to keep the old ways dead and buried. Their goal was to prevent Netherese secrets from being rediscovered, in the hopes of protecting [[Toril]] from suffering a similar apocalypse. To this end they employed a myriad of tactics ranging from disinformation and theft to outright assassination.

==Combat==
Cultists normally favored stealth and guile over direct combat, but when forced they attack with ferocity and efficiency.  Their prowess was equivalent to a rogue, and they struck fast and hard, preferably before their target realized that the cultist is there.  Their special abilities, particularly the ''Death Attack'' (see [[#Cultist Abilities|below]]) make such surprise attacks devastating.

==Abilities==
;Spellcasting:  Cultists gained the ability to cast a small number of [[arcane]] spells from the schools of [[abjuration]] and [[enchantment]].
;Ominous Presence:  Cultists had a knack for lying and intimidation which was useful for dissuading adventurers from uncovering dangerous Netherese secrets.
;Zeal:  Cultists had a boost in morale when fighting arcane spellcasters.
;Sneak Attack:  Like rogues, cultists could stab opponents in the back with lethal force.
;Smite Mage:  Like paladins, cultists could smash through enemy defenses.
;Death Attack:  Like [[assassin]]s, cultists could instantly kill rival combatants.

==Equipment==
Cultists were proficient with many deadly weapons, wore light armor, and used [[buckler]]s in combat.
