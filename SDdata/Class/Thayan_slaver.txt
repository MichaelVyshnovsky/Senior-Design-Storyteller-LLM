Thayan slavers were those malevolent individuals from Thay who traveled across the Realms capturing and subjugating other living beings.
Considering there were fewer realms that allowed slavery as opposed to those who opposed it, Thayan slavers often worked under some guise that granted them anonymity.
They often congregated in the great Thayan cities of Bezantur, Eltabbar, and Tyraturos, each of which had a sprawling slave market.
Slavers were highly skilled at inflicting non-lethal harm with their attacks.
Similarly, Thayan slavers were considered experts at breaking down the will of other beings.
