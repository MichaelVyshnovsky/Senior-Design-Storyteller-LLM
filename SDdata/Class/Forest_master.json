            "Nature & Knowledge": "Forest Masters, as their name suggested, masterful in their knowledge of forested areas. They were able to recognize and know the form every type of forest plant they came across, as well as to assess drinkability of any source of [[water]].\n\nThese agents of Silvanus gained a much longer lifespan than other mortals, due to their connection with nature.",
            "Combat": "These worshipers of the Forest Father often used blunt weapons, which became infused with power as they themselves gained power. Forest Masters with a great connection to Silvanus could treat plants similar to how evil clerics could treat [[undead]], choosing either to send them away or command them.\n\nForest Masters had many unique combat abilities, such as slamming into their enemies with great strength. When this slamming ability was used, the masters became oak-like in appearance, gaining a green tint and leafy hair Taking this connection further, powerful Forest Masters could morph into sentient plant creatures, with all the added benefits (and weaknesses) and immunities of such creatures.\n\nWhen these agents of Silvanus were completely still, they could gain enormous strength, and send out roots over a short period of time to quickly regenerate."
