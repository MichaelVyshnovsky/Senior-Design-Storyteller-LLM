In [[Faiths and Pantheons]] he is stated to be a Lesser Deity, and deities don't usually have a CR. This is speculation, but CR 20 might refer to Baphomet as a demon lord in other cosmologies (as implied in [[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition]] page 62 D&D 3e had all settings in separate cosmologies, opposed to ADnD; and as stated in [[Faiths and Pantheons]] page 4, local aspects of deities were considered intependent from their other selves in other "worlds").

'''Baphomet''' ({{Pronounce|ba|FOM|et|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}|audio=Baphomet.ogg}} {{Pronounce|BAF|u|met|refs=}}) was a [[demon lord]] who ruled a layer of the [[Abyss]] called the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 600: Endless Maze|Endless Maze]]. He was the Prince of Beasts, an embodiment of savagery and an insidious force that wormed its way into the heart of his followers to deceive them into embracing brutality.{{Cite dragon/369/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Baphomet, the Prince of Beasts|19-22}}

==Description==
Baphomet appeared as a great, {{SIAdj|20|ft|adj=tall}} black-furred minotaur with six iron horns. A fiendish light burned in his red eyes.   

==Powers==
Baphomet could spit out gouts of [[unholy water]].

==Possessions==
He wielded a giant [[bardiche]] called ''[[Heartcleaver]]''.

==Realm==
Baphomet's realm was the Endless Maze, the 600{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], supposedly infinite in size. Here, Baphomet dwelt in his palace, the Lyktion,{{Cite dragon/341/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Baphomet: Prince of Beasts|24-25}}

==Relationships==
[[File:Baphomet - dragon 369.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Baphomet, the Horned King.'']]
Baphomet hated Yeenoghu, and the two were bitter enemies. They'd warred against each other{{Cite dragon/359/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Apocrypha|57}}

Baphomet had an unusual relationship (for a [[tanar'ri]]) with [[Pale Night]], who shared his lair. The two were neighbors with what amounted to an unofficial noninterference pact, as Pale Night's influence did not really extend much further than the edges of her plateau. Though they never joined forces to accomplish a goal, it was possible that any attempt to lay siege to the holdings of one might provoke the other.

==Worshipers==

Baphomet had a multitude of [[minotaur]] and [[humanoid]] followers and minions. He was also served by [[bulezau]] and by [[ghour]] demons, a race of demons resembling burly, hairless minotaurs that commanded troops of these mortal minions. He sought to use them to further his schemes, notably to gain the upper hand in his battles against [[Yeenoghu]]. A multitude of other twisted creatures revered Baphomet as well, some becoming his thralls, and if they pleased their bestial patron, they would be granted rulership of a portion of the Endless Maze. Those who failed Baphomet were devoured, naturally.{{cite book/Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss|152-154}}{{Cite dragon/369/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Baphomet, the Prince of Beasts|25-29}}{{Cite dragon/341/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Baphomet: Prince of Beasts|27-28}}

Baphomet granted spells as a [[lesser deity]] and had as his symbol a twisted circular maze awash in blood.

==History==
Baphomet began his existence as a mortal creature, though it was unknown, even by Baphomet himself, whether he was a beast that lived as a man or a man who lived as a beast. It was also suggested that he was cursed by the gods for daring to treat them like cattle, and thus banished to the Abyss. In any case, Baphomet reveled in his power, seeing the curse more as a blessing.{{Cite dragon/341/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Baphomet: Prince of Beasts|21}}

By the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Baphomet had been captured by an alliance between [[Yeenoghu]] and [[Orcus]] and resided as prisoner in Orcus' layer.<ref group="note">The year 1357 DR was derived from the event of King [[Virdin]]'s death which is mentioned as a past event in ''The Throne of Bloodstone'' on page 3.
