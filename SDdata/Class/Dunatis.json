But the author of that article does note that Welsh versions of the Mabinogion briefly mention someone named Ossol, quoting from it, “under whose feet the highest mountain straightaway became a plain.”\nThe avatar form of Dunatis was that of a rather ordinary looking human male.\nDunatis was allegedly one of the most approachable members of his pantheon, as he found himself rarely called upon due to his portfolio. He was even known to prefer spreading the word of his faith himself.\nDunatis was immune to charm, paralysis, and petrification effects.\nThe most notable power of Dunatis was to flatten large mountains into flat plains and vice versa. This effect occurred instantaneously and was often utilized to destroy an enemys fortifications. He could also manifest boulders in thin air and throw them with great accuracy at targets up to  away.\nDunatis owned a shield and set of armor, both with a +4 enchantment, that he always donned when entering combat.\nIn the kingdom of Bakar, a survivor state of the Imaskar Empire, a mighty city known as Medinat Muskawoon housed temples to gods of faiths that the populaces ancestors brought over from their original worlds. Among these temples was one dedicated to Dunatis.\nthumb|273px|The Pinnacle stands out proudly on a map of Tir na Og.\nDunatis lived within the Outlands, in the divine realm of Tir na Og. His own divine realm within Tir na Og was a vast mountain on its fringe, known as the Pinnacle.

Trees covered the slopes of this mountain and wild animals could be found roaming freely about it.\nDunatis was known to be revered by some rilmani.\nThis deity claimed to have been the one responsible for the creation of the Spire that stood at the center of the Outlands."
