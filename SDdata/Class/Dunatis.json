        "mainbody": "'''Dunatis''' was a minor interloper [[deity]] of mountains and peaks who originated from another [[earth|plane of existence]].[[Dragon magazine 65|''Dragon'' #65, \"Tuatha De Danann — A revised Celtic mythos\"]] notes that the [[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities & Demigods'']] sourcebook's source for Dunatis is a mystery. But the author of that article does note that Welsh versions of the [[Wikipedia:Mabinogion|Mabinogion]] briefly mention someone named Ossol, quoting from it, “under whose feet the highest mountain straightaway became a plain.”",
        "Description": "The [[avatar]] form of Dunatis was that of a rather ordinary looking [[human]] male.",
        "Personality": "Dunatis was allegedly one of the most approachable members of his pantheon, as he found himself rarely called upon due to his portfolio. He was even known to prefer spreading the word of his faith himself.",
        "Abilities": "Dunatis was immune to ''[[charm]]'', paralysis, and [[petrification]] effects.\n\nThe most notable power of Dunatis was to flatten large mountains into flat plains and vice versa. This effect occurred instantaneously and was often utilized to destroy an enemy's fortifications. He could also manifest boulders in thin air and throw them with great accuracy at targets up to {{SI|1000|yards|long=yes}} away.",
        "Possessions": "Dunatis owned a [[shield]] and set of [[armor]], both with a [[item enchantment|''+4 enchantment'']], that he always donned when entering combat.",
        "History": "In the kingdom of [[Bakar]], a survivor state of the [[Imaskar Empire]],<ref> a mighty city known as [[Medinat Muskawoon]] housed temples to gods of faiths that the populace's ancestors brought over from their original worlds. Among these temples was one dedicated to Dunatis.",
        "Realm": "[[File:The Pinnacle.png|thumb|273px|''The Pinnacle stands out proudly on a map of Tir na Og.'']]\nDunatis lived within the [[Outlands]], in the [[divine realm]] of [[Tir na Og]]. His own divine realm within Tir na Og was a vast mountain on its fringe, known as the Pinnacle. Though just a single mountain, the Pinnacle's terrain varied considerably across its surface, from nearly flat areas to sheer, steep rocks. Trees covered the slopes of this mountain and wild animals could be found roaming freely about it.",
        "Worshipers": "Dunatis was known to be revered by some [[rilmani]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "This deity claimed to have been the one responsible for the creation of the [[Spire]] that stood at the center of the Outlands."
