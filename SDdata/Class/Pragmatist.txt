Pragmatists or Clerics of the Faith Pragmatic, were the most liberal and most common of all priests in Zakhara. A pragmatists belief system was based upon taking the ethos of the gods and fitting it to face the problems of the contemporary world. Pragmatists often wandered far from their temples in order to help spread their teachings.Pragmatist was a cleric class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.
Pragmatists did not have any special requirements.
These men and women were considered to be the most even-tempered and understanding of all religious figures in Zakhara. They were very active with their gods ethos. For example, a pragmatist worshiping a god of healing was usually found at a hospice.
Pragmatists moved around often, sometimes only holding a position for a few months before travelling to their next destination. Pragmatists were very tolerant of other faiths and their beliefs. It was not uncommon to find two pragmatists of "opposing" religions travelling together in harmony.
Every religion in Zakhara had a pragmatist wing, even those of the heavily moralist pantheon. The Temple of Ten Thousand Gods was the most popular church among pragmatists.
Pragmatists prominently displayed the symbol of their faith. Other than that they carried a wide array of equipment and gear depending on their current goal or mission.
Pragmatists were given free room and board at any mosque of their faith.
