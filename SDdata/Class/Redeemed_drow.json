        "mainbody": "A redeemed drow was a term applied to drow who tried to become redeemed, meaning a drow whom Lolth lost any hold over. It did not mean that theyd already succeeded at it but merely that they were on their way towards success.\nThe Spider Queen had some influence over every drow. This hold over an individual was inescapable for a drow except by one method, which was to ascend to a higher level of existence to become a redeemed drow. This was done through a complete mental denial of Lolth as well as through committed actions against Lolth.\nThese committed actions served to advertise to the world that the redeemed drow was indeed an enemy of Lolth and was serious about getting rid of her influence.\nIf this advertisement was successful, Corellon took notice of the redeemed drow and imbued a sense of purpose on them. This sense of purpose had a driving effect, but the closer the drow managed to come to the end of the mission to oppose Lolth, the more minions Lolth sent against him or her and tried to make the redeemed drow doubt him or herself.\nWhen the drow succeeded in the mission, Corellon redeemed the drow and gifted them with a second life as an elf with no trace of the Spider Queens hold left. On reincarnation, their memories faded and the former drow was free to enjoy life.\nRedeemed drow had a few abilities that helped them to complete their mission against all odds. On killing demons or spiders, they could revitalize themselves. They could use the energy from their Lolthtouched abilities to regain access to their already expended abilities. If they survived a killing blow, they were instantly healed and acquired additional protection for the rest of the battle, but only once a day.\nThey also gained one magical ability called light of heaven, which allowed them to temporarily channel Corellons anger, which he felt against those who dared to hurt the redeemed drow. This anger was not destructive but of a protective nature. Their wounds healed and the redeemed drow shed light that provided those within it protection against dark powers.\nCorellon Corellon was the god who could lift Lolths touch from a drow and was the one who determined whether the redeemed drow was worthy of true redemption upon completion of the mission to oppose his former wife.\nLolth Lolth was the goddess whose touch the redeemed drow wanted to get rid of. As the redeemed drow started to work more effectively against her, the more servants she set against him or her."
