        "mainbody": "uthlims were specialty priests devoted to Iyachtu Xvim, the Godson of Bane.\nAuthlims often served as spies for High Tyrannar Fzoul Chembryl.\nFear spells had no effect upon an authlim. They were able to heal themselves once per day by calling on Xvims divine power. They could cast several spells on a daily basis including mace of Xvim, neutralize poison, poison, reaving blades, cure serious wounds, protection from good, and cure critical wounds. Heal could be cast once per tenday, gate once per month, and binding twice per month. Authlims could also generate an aura of fear for  around themselves.\nAuthlims only wielded blunt melee weapons and javelins. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were allowed to wear."
