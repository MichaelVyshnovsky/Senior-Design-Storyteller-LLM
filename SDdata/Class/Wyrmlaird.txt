'''Wyrmlairds''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Tiamat]], the Dragon Queen within the [[Untheric pantheon]]. Wyrmlairds specifically served [[Tchazzar]], her [[aspect]] within [[Chessenta]].

==Activities==
These individuals assisted in executing Tchazzar's plans and schemes within Chessenta.

==Culture==
Wyrmlairds were always [[human]]s of [[Chessenta]]n lineage.

==Abilities==
Their association with Tchazzar made it easier for them to resist normal and magical fire. They could cast ''[[hold person]]'' and ''[[suggestion]]'' and they could breathe fire as if they had consumed a ''[[potion of fire breath]]'' once per day. Their time spent perfecting martial training made them nearly as capable as skilled warriors in combat. Particularly powerful wyrmlairds were able to summon a faithful [[red dragon]] to serve as their personal mount.

==Possessions==
In addition to any blunt weapons, a wyrmlaird sometimes carried a [[longsword]] or [[two-handed sword]]. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear.
