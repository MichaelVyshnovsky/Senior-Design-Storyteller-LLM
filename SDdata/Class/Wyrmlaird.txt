Wyrmlairds were specialty priests devoted to Tiamat, the Dragon Queen within the Untheric pantheon. Wyrmlairds specifically served Tchazzar, her aspect within Chessenta.
These individuals assisted in executing Tchazzars plans and schemes within Chessenta.
Wyrmlairds were always humans of Chessentan lineage.
Their association with Tchazzar made it easier for them to resist normal and magical fire. They could cast hold person and suggestion and they could breathe fire as if they had consumed a potion of fire breath once per day. Their time spent perfecting martial training made them nearly as capable as skilled warriors in combat. Particularly powerful wyrmlairds were able to summon a faithful red dragon to serve as their personal mount.
In addition to any blunt weapons, a wyrmlaird sometimes carried a longsword or two-handed sword. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear.
