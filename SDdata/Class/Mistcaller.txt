'''Mistcallers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Leira]], the Lady of the Mists.

==Culture==
Mistcallers were always [[human]]s or [[gnome]]s, though other gnomes often looked down upon their brethren who chose this path.

==Abilities==
Many mistcallers were skilled ventriloquists and in the art of disguise. In addition to their clerical [[spell]]s, mistcallers could cast [[wizard]] spells from the school of [[illusion]]. They were able to cast illusion or phantasm spells from [[scroll]]s without the need for a ''[[read magic]]'' spell. They excelled at seeing through illusions created by others. They could cast the following spells once per day: ''[[impenetrable falsehood]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'', ''[[audible glamer]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', ''[[shadow magic]]'', ''[[demi-shadow magic]]'', ''[[disbelief]]'', and ''[[mislead]]''. Extremely powerful mistcallers could create a ''[[permanent illusion]]'' three times per tenday.

Mistcallers were strictly forbidden to cast the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell or use any [[magic item]] with similar affects.

==Possessions==
They only wielded bludgeoning weapons. They did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were permitted to wear. However, armor of any type completely negated their spellcasting abilities and other magical powers.
