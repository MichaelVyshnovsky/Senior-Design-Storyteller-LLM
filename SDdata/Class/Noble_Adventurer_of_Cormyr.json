        "mainbody": "Noble adventurers of Cormyr were aristocratic upper-class Cormyreans who fancied themselves as dashing warriors, simply looking for the thrill of adventure to liven up their lives.\nDespite their name, not all of these adventurers were actually born into the Cormyrean nobility many of them were wealthy merchant heirs or already-wealthy adventurers who had found a place within the kingdoms aristocracy.\nMany noble adventurers were prideful and talked down to anybody they considered beneath them.\nWhile lone adventurers were frowned upon, and groups were required to purchase an official charter, those who sought the adventuring lifestyle for the good of others garnered good will from their neighbors. Many nobles set off on their own to give some monsters or bandits a good seeing-to, though few were actual paragons of virtue who actually endeavored to do the right thing.\nThese ostentatious personalities often used their wealth to buy themselves powerful or just plain flashy equipment.\nNoble adventurers were familiar with the ins and outs of life in court and have become adept at talking the talk. They were knowledgeable about to whom they should speak and the manner in which to do so.\nThey often thought themselves as dashing heroes and expected glory when they dove head first into battle. Noble adventurers were often emboldened by the ideal they have set aside for themselves in their minds, to the point where they exuded a natural aura of leadership."
