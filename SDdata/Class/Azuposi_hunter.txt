'''Hunters''' were [[warrior]]s who represented the closest thing to soldiers among the peaceful [[Azuposi]] people of the [[Pasocada Basin]].<ref name="CoG-pA5-A6" >

==Activities==
All hunters proved themselves through their skill with weapons, earning the honor to provide meat for their community. Hunters were the first, and sometimes only, line of defense against any attack from both [[monster]]s or [[Nahopaca]] raiders.

==Culture==
In order to honor the [[spirit]]s of their slain prey, a hunter would always leave choice organs from the kill behind for the spirit to reclaim. Fraternities of hunters observed ceremonial rituals together. Hunters held a prestigious position among the Azuposi. They were forbidden from ever bragging about their exploits.

==Abilities==
Hunters were skilled in tracking and a variety of survival tactics.

==Possessions==
All hunters carried either a [[short bow]] or [[sling]]. Most of the gear needed for a hunt was included in a leather sack strapped to their back.
