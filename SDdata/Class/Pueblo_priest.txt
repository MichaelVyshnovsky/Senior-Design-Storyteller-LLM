Pueblo priests monitored the spiritual welfare of the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin.
Pueblo priests used their magic to benefits others, but also offered guidance through their wisdom. They were prepared to guide their community through any hardship on the horizon.
Given their importance to their village, a pueblo priest could only avoid their duties for personal matters if granted the permission of their superiors.
They were skilled in the use of talismanic magic. They could not turn undead.
These priests were always dressed in their ceremonial garb including headresses, charms, and talismans. If they bothered to carry a weapon, it was always of the blunt variety.
