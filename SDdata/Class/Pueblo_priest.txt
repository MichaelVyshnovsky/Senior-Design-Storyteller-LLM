'''Pueblo priests''' monitored the spiritual welfare of the [[Azuposi]] people of the [[Pasocada Basin]].<ref name="CoG-pA8-A9" >

==Activities==
Pueblo priests used their magic to benefits others, but also offered guidance through their wisdom. They were prepared to guide their community through any hardship on the horizon.

==Culture==
Given their importance to their village, a pueblo priest could only avoid their duties for personal matters if granted the permission of their superiors.

==Abilities==
They were skilled in the use of [[talismanic magic]]. They could not [[turn undead]].

==Possessions==
These priests were always dressed in their ceremonial garb including headresses, charms, and talismans. If they bothered to carry a weapon, it was always of the blunt variety.
