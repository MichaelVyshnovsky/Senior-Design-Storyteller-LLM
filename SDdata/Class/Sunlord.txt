'''Sunlords''', or '''sunladies''' if female, were the [[specialty priest]]s of [[Amaunator]].

==Culture==
[[Church of Amaunator|Amaunatori]] priests were mandated to learn the intricacies of the law of the land they lived in. The sunlords' legal knowledge reached extreme levels. Every sunlord knew the laws of the country, down to the individual provinces and cities they'd been raised and/or had lived in, which were not necessarily the same place. This knowledge could also extend to very obscure and/or foreign laws.

Every sunlord was literate and had a grasp of etiquette.

==Abilities==
===Magical Abilities===
Sunlords were spellcasting priests with an especially high aptitude for [[spell]]s from the [[Sun sphere|sun]], [[Law sphere|law]], and [[Elemental sphere|fire]] spheres. They had major access to the [[all sphere|all]], [[Charm sphere|charm]], [[Elemental sphere|fire, air]], [[Law sphere|law]], [[Summoning sphere|summoning]], [[Sun sphere|sun]], and the [[time sphere]]s, while they had minor access to the [[Divination sphere|divination]], [[Elemental sphere|earth]], [[Healing sphere|healing]], [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]], [[Numbers sphere|numbers]], [[Protection sphere|protection]], and [[thought sphere]]s.

With increasing strength, Sunlords developed ever more magical abilities. These included the ability to cast ''[[detect lie]]'' an increasing number of times per day. Abilities they could use once per day were ''[[rigid thinking]]'', ''[[compulsive order]]'', ''[[legal thoughts]]'', and ''[[Sol's searing orb]]''. ''[[Impeding permission]]'' could be cast once every three days. ''[[Sunray]]'' could be cast twice per day.

Although not every god's specialty priest could [[turn undead]], Sunlords could do turn undead. However, they were not as good at it as their [[cleric]] brethren. This ability was shared even by evil sunlords, though they could no command them. This power was thanks to Amaunator's association with [[the sun]], which was anathema to many [[undead]], but also because these creatures were against the "laws of nature".

Sunlords could also get an idea about a person's ethical outlook.

==Possessions==
All sunlords were capable of wearing all kinds of [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s as long as they were designed to bludgeon people.

==History==
Sunlords were the specialty priests of Amaunator.
