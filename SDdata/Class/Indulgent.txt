'''Indulgents''' were [[priest]]s of the [[Church of Sharess]] who specialized in spying, seduction, and celebration.<ref name="WaPotR-p105" >

==Activities==
Indulgents went about their duties to the extreme.

==Culture==
Though similar in their purpose to [[Sune]]'s [[silkwhisper]]s, indulgents performed their duties with a hint of a dark side influenced by [[Sharess]]. They did not shy from violence and cruelty when needed. Indulgents were extremely attractive men and women.

==Abilities==
Indulgents were quite skilled at prying secrets from anyone whom they spent a little bit of time with in a private setting. They could use their wiles to essentially ''[[charm person|charm]]'' a target for twelve hours. These abilities usually only worked on members of the indulgent's race.

They could not [[turn undead]].

==Possessions==
They favored lace or satin garments usually decorated with patterns of red, white or black. A rich crimson [[cloak]] completed their ensemble. Their [[holy symbol]] was usually worn as an anklet. They never wore [[armor]].

Indulgents preferred smaller weapons such as [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s, or [[garotte]]s. They often carried debilitating non-lethal poisons as well.
