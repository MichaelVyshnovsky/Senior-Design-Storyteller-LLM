'''Orbs''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Iyachtu Xvim]] who served as missionaries by spreading the ugly word of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] through blackmail and intimidation. They were named for Xvim's glowing green eyes.<ref name="WaPotR-p83" >

==Activities==
An orb's primary mission was to recruit new followers for Iyachtu Xvim in order to increase his influence. They usually did this by orating charming speeches about [[Cyric]]'s failure and Xvim's resurgence. Anyone who failed to see the wisdom in following Xvim was confronted privately with threats.

==Culture==
Orbs were obsessed with finding and destroying the [[Cyrinishad]] to the point where it would take precedence over recruiting followers if an orb received any information about the book's whereabouts.

==Abilities==
These individuals could [[Turn undead|turn]] and [[command undead]]. They were immune to all forms of normal and magical ''[[fear]]'' and could cast the ''fear'' [[spell]] once per day. They could not cast any spells from the [[creation sphere]].

==Possessions==
Orbs garbed themselves in long black [[robe|cassocks]], black [[iron]] [[skullcap]]s, and green stoles. Their black [[gauntlet]]s had green eyes painted on the back of the hand and actually served as their [[holy symbol]]. Orbs wore their cassocks over [[armor]], which was usually [[chainmail]]. Their weapon of choice was the [[warhammer]].
