        "mainbody": "'''Psionicists''', also known as '''psions''',{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-23/Amauna}} were individuals that used the powers of the mind―or [[psionics]]―to supernaturally influence the world around them.",
        "Culture": {
            "Alignment": "Due to their introspective world view, psions typically leaned towards the [[alignment]]s of [[neutral evil]], [[neutral good]], or [[true neutral]]. While some could be found that were [[chaotic]]-aligned or [[lawful]]-aligned,<ref group=\"note\" name=\"chaos\">In [[AD&D]] psionicists were restricted from having a chaotic alignment, to the point that an alignment changing to chaotic made a psionicist gradually lose their disciplines. In 3{{rd}} & 4{{th}} edition, no such restrictions were in place, though this cited 3{{rd}} edition text suggests to players that psions are thematically best suited towards neutral-alignments. Good-aligned psions often sought out what was best in the world and would attempt to use their powers to preserve it. Evil-aligned psions, whether openly or discretely, often sought to mold others to meet their desires.",
            "Religion": "Many psions were not particularly drawn to one [[deity]] or another; Later generations of psions commonly worshiped [[Sardior]].{{Cite web/The Legend of Sardior}}\n\nOn other worlds, such as [[Nerath]], psions could be found worshiping either [[Corellon]], [[Ioun (deity)|Ioun]], [[Sehanine Moonbow]], or even [[Vecna]].\n\nDuergar psionicists were largely worshipers of [[Deep Duerra]], whose legendary exploits were credited for their innate ability to wield the Invisible Art.<ref> In [[1371 DR]], pure psionicists made up 22% of Deep Duerra's clergy across [[Faerûn]], while about three-quarters of her [[cleric]]s and [[norothor]] were also psions. Similarly, the other duergar god, [[Laduguer]], had about two-thirds of his clergy made up by cleric/psions. Duerran priests also typically acted as teachers for duergar youth, helping them to develop their innate talents.\n\nAmong illithid psions, the deity [[Ilsensine]] was commonly worship. Some evil psions of other races were also known to form cults to the power, as it did not discriminate in its promises of power and dominion.<ref>",
            "Reputation & Relationships": "Psionicists were considered in some areas of the Realms, such as in the [[Dalelands]], to be strange and dangerous people. But for most of the general populace in the Realms, psionics and psionicists alike were unrecognized or barely understood, often confusing them with traditional spellcasters of magic, hence the term \"mind mages\".\n\nIn the nation of [[Cormyr]] there was long debate held over whether or not psions should be allowed in the Cormyrian military, with the [[War Wizards]] being considerably suspicious of mind mages. The matter finally was resolved in favor of psions in [[1373 DR]], when the clairvoyant powers of the young seer [[Ormion Bowbreaker]] allowed [[Castle Crag]] to be prepared for an impending [[gnoll]] raid. After an interrogation to determine their trustworthiness, the War Wizards set about combing Cormyr for prospective wild talents.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}\n\nIn the [[Underdark]], many [[drow]] cities had academies that catered towards psions.<ref>\n\nWhenever gitzherai got together to form a [[Gith dictionary#R|rrakkma]], at least one member of the hunting party was always a psion.<ref>{{Cite dragon/281/Calm amid the Storm|33}}\n\nThough they shared some similarities with [[wilder]]s, in terms of the development of their powers, Among other users of the Invisible Art, psions most often got along with [[monk]]s and [[psychic warrior]]s, as they similarly led disciplined lives and had to actively train in order to master their psionic powers."

            "Manifestations": "In many of the humanoid races, manifestations of psionic power could lead to a secondary displays that revealed the nature of their power. These included, but were not limited to, visual, auditory and olfactory senses that were triggered when their powers were used.<ref> Simple psionic charms and mind-reading abilities often elicited a low, droning sounds, while polymorphic manifestations induced phantom scents of [[saffron]] or [[ginger]] in others.<ref>\n\nFor those whom psionics was innate, manifestations could arise at a young age, though they became especially noticeable for during puberty.\n\nAs most of these secondary displays are difficult to observe, most tactics used by psionicists can prove surprising to non-psions. If caught unaware, or in the case of a powerful mind mage very aware, a psionicist could be a powerful force to reckon with.",
            "Psicrystal": "All psions possessed the capacity to create a ''psicrystal'', a physical extension of their own personality. Measuring roughly the size of a [[human]] hand, these crystaline [[construct]]s had the benefit of granting special powers to psions. Being that they were fragments of the psion's own personality, these constructs had some level of sentience. They exhibited a personality chosen by the psion at the moment of their creation, could understand all languages known by the psion, and could communicate in one language known by the psion."
        },
        "Possessions": "Traditionally, psionicists did not need any physical tools or weaponry to practice their discipline, though following the [[Spellplague]] some psions began using [[implement]]s to enhance their abilities. Typically these took the form of [[orb]]s and [[staves]], through which psions would channel their psionic energy into powers.\n\nSome psionicists disdained the use of weapons, feeling they were beneath people with such powwer, though their usefulness could not be fully denied. They tended towards weaponry of small or medium size, such as [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[warhammer]]s.\n\nIn terms of armor, most psionicists preferred to don themselves in either [[cloth armor]],",

        "History": "For much of [[Toril]]'s history, psionics were incredibly rare,{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-12-07 - Sardior's Activities}}\n\nDuring [[the Founding Time]], the most incidence of psions on the planet were in the psiocracy of Jhaamdath,\n\nIn the following age, the [[Age of Humanity]], there were no records of psionicists ever present in the [[Netherese Empire]]. They were, however, present across other nations and kingdoms of Toril.\n\nFollowing the Time of Troubles, psionics appeared to no longer exist in any form in the Realms. Many psionicists found themselves to have lost their abilities and received nothing in exchange. Prior to this event, some dismissed the existence of psionicists and their mind magic all together. However, in time psionic powers began stablizing into a new form on Toril and the planet saw a dramatic rise in the number of psionicists. Some scholars of psionics theorized that reason for psionics changing beyond recognition and human understanding nature occurred as a result of the goddess [[Mystra]]'s death and her essence merging with that of the land.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"changes\" />\n\nThe next dramatic rise in the population of psions would occur in the decades following the [[Spellplague]]. Some scholars speculated this rise correlated to the substantial changes in Toril's magic that were wrought by the event, whilst others bandied a hotly contested claim that the return of [[Abeir]] brought an influx of psionic energy.",
