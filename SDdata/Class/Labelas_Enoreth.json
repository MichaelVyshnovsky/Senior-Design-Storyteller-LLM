Together with [[Sehanine Moonbow]], he oversaw the long lifespan of the elves and their lives after they had left the mortal realms. His symbol was the setting sun.",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "On rare occasions, Labelas appeared as a mist that aged or, more commonly, revitalized creatures and objects he enveloped.\n\nLabelas showed his desires through subtle means and rewarded those who pleased him with rare [[gem]]s and valuable stones."
        },
        "Personality": "He was a philosopher, a patient teacher, and an instructor who gave wisdom and knowledge to young and old alike.",
        "Powers": "Labelas could place creatures into ''[[stasis]]'' merely by looking at them. He could restore or age a creature by up to one hundred years by touching them. If a creature had managed to travel through time, Labelas could restore them to their proper place in the timeline. He also ''[[slow]]ed'' any hostile creature within {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} of him. Magic cast upon him that interfered with time had no effect.",
        "Possessions": "Labelas wielded the ''[[Timestave]]'', a magical quarterstaff that aged or rejuvenated those who were hit with it, at the discretion of the wielder.",
        "Realm": "Labelas's divine realm was known as the [[Vanishing Tower]]. For the vast majority of the time, the Vanishing Tower was not visible on [[Arvandor]]. A few believed it to be invisible, but the more common theory was that it resided on a [[demiplane]] of some kind. When the Tower could be seen, it was considered an omen of great or perilous times ahead.",
        "Relationships": "Labelas had good relations with the rest of the Seldarine, though he could get impatient with [[Erevan Ilesere]]'s tricks. He was closely allied with [[Mystra]], both in her previous aspect as [[Mystryl]] the human god of time and in her later aspect as the Lady of Mysteries. He also was considered an ally of several gods concerned with knowledge: [[Deneir]], [[Milil]], [[Oghma]] and [[Savras]]; as well as the [[dragon]] god [[Null]], in his aspect of the Guardian of the Lost; the [[naga]] deity [[Shekinester]]; and the [[halfling]] deity [[Cyrrollalee]].\n\nHe was opposed to the gods of entropy, decay and those who promoted [[undead|undeath]]. [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], the dwarven god of battle, had a long-standing grudge against him.\n\nLabelas was very close to his [[Chosen]], [[Vartan Hai Sylvar]], whom he possessed as his [[avatar]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] and who briefly served as his [[proxy]] before returning to [[Faerûn]].\n\nThe [[White Stag of Labelas]] was another of the god's servants who appeared whenever elves needed guidance, though it had only ever been recorded as appearing on [[Evermeet]].",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Church": "{{Main|Church of Labelas Enoreth}}\n[[File:Labelas Enoreth priest.png|thumb|right|''A priest of Labelas Enoreth, wearing simple robes of the faith.'']]\nLabelas's priests were responsible for educating the young and promoting and acquiring knowledge. They were also record keepers and historians. They met in groves at sunset to pray, meditate, and mark the passing of another day by sharing prayers and knowledge. His [[cleric]]s typically dress in light gray robes."
        },
        "History": {
            "Rumors and Legends": "The reason Labelas appears to only have one eye, is that he traded one in exchange for the ability to see through the timestream."
