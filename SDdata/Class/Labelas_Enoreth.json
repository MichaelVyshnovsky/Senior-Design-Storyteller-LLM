        "mainbody": "Lord of the ContinuumThe Sage at Sunset\nLabelas Enoreth (), called the Lord of the Continuum, was the chaotic good elven deity who governed the orderly passage of time and guarded against those who would alter the path of history. Together with Sehanine Moonbow, he oversaw the long lifespan of the elves and their lives after they had left the mortal realms. His symbol was the setting sun.\nLabelas manifested as an androgynous elf with silver-colored hair and a single misty gray eye, the other was covered by an eyepatch. He wore multi-colored robes of blue, gray, green and white.\nOn rare occasions, Labelas appeared as a mist that aged or, more commonly, revitalized creatures and objects he enveloped.\nLabelas showed his desires through subtle means and rewarded those who pleased him with rare gems and valuable stones.\nHe was a philosopher, a patient teacher, and an instructor who gave wisdom and knowledge to young and old alike. \nLabelas could place creatures into stasis merely by looking at them. He could restore or age a creature by up to one hundred years by touching them. If a creature had managed to travel through time, Labelas could restore them to their proper place in the timeline. He also slowed any hostile creature within  of him. Magic cast upon him that interfered with time had no effect.\nLabelas wielded the Timestave, a magical quarterstaff that aged or rejuvenated those who were hit with it, at the discretion of the wielder.\nLabelass divine realm was known as the Vanishing Tower. For the vast majority of the time, the Vanishing Tower was not visible on Arvandor. A few believed it to be invisible, but the more common theory was that it resided on a demiplane of some kind. When the Tower could be seen, it was considered an omen of great or perilous times ahead.\nLabelas had good relations with the rest of the Seldarine, though he could get impatient with Erevan Ileseres tricks. He was closely allied with Mystra, both in her previous aspect as Mystryl the human god of time and in her later aspect as the Lady of Mysteries. He also was considered an ally of several gods concerned with knowledge Deneir, Milil, Oghma and Savras as well as the dragon god Null, in his aspect of the Guardian of the Lost the naga deity Shekinester and the halfling deity Cyrrollalee.\nHe was opposed to the gods of entropy, decay and those who promoted undeath. Clangeddin Silverbeard, the dwarven god of battle, had a long-standing grudge against him.\nLabelas was very close to his Chosen, Vartan Hai Sylvar, whom he possessed as his avatar during the Time of Troubles and who briefly served as his proxy before returning to Faer√ªn.\nThe White Stag of Labelas was another of the gods servants who appeared whenever elves needed guidance, though it had only ever been recorded as appearing on Evermeet.\nthumb|The holy symbol of Labelas.\nHe was often praised but rarely invoked. Those who worshiped him were those with an interest in ideas and knowledge, and the changes wrought by the passage of time sages, historians, philosophers, and librarians.\nthumb|right|A priest of Labelas Enoreth, wearing simple robes of the faith.\nLabelass priests were responsible for educating the young and promoting and acquiring knowledge. They were also record keepers and historians. They met in groves at sunset to pray, meditate, and mark the passing of another day by sharing prayers and knowledge. His clerics typically dress in light gray robes.\nBefore its fall, the realm of Orva worshiped Labelas as Chronos, the god of time.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in the , Labelas Enoreth possessed the body of one of his clerics, Vartan Hai Sylvar. Driven mad by his banishment from his home plane of Arvandor, Labelas committed a number of heinous deeds and fought with Clangeddin Silverbeard on Ruathym and harmed Vartans friends on the Realms Master. This caused Vartan to begin questioning his faith towards his god and creating a large deal of hostility from his party towards the deity. After the Time of Troubles came to end, however, a contrite Labelas made attempts to make amends with Vartan and his party. Due to Labelas show of remorse, Vartan accepted him as his god again, becoming the Chosen of Labelas.\nThe reason Labelas appears to only have one eye, is that he traded one in exchange for the ability to see through the timestream."
