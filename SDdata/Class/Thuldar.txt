'''Thuldor''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Laduguer]], the Gray Protector.

==Culture==
The vast majority of thuldor were [[gray dwarves]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, both male and female, could become a thuldar.

==Abilities==
Thuldor were skilled herbalists and animal handlers. Many were also [[psionicist]]s. Laduguer's blessing made it harder to strike thuldor in combat while also making it slightly easier for them to resist the effects of [[magic]], [[poison]], ''etc.''

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, thuldor could cast ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[strength of stone]]'', ''[[slow poison]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[wall of stone]]'', and ''[[stone tell]]'' on a daily basis. Additionally, a thuldar could cast ''[[find traps]]'' at will and ''[[turn pebble to boulder]]'', to include the reverse of the spell, twice per day.

==Possessions==
Thuldor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the [[armor]] they were allowed to wear.
