Militars were specialty priests devoted to Anhur, the Mulhorandi General of Gods.
As with all followers of Anhur, Militars were tasked with defending Mulhorands traditional borders. Later Militars began countering the weather-controlling magic used by the Red Wizards of Thay.
Militars spent much of their time training their martial skills and drilling Mulhorands legions for combat readiness.
These individuals were extremely vigorous compared to other clerics. They shave their heads bald and painted a trio of blue circles on their forehead to indicate their station. Their skin was usually dyed a reddish tint and covered with tattoos of fierce creatures they slew in combat. High-ranking Militars wore jeweled gold pectoral collars shaped like predators.
Militars were skilled charioteers. Novice Militars could cast both stumble or command once per day. Mid-ranking Militars also gained the ability to cast armor or shield once per day. Higher ranking Militars could cast bird of prey once per day and thunderstroke twice per day, and flame strike once per day. High-ranking Militars were also extremely proficient with their chosen melee weapon.
Militars were able to use any weapon of their choosing with the lance being the only allowed polearm. There were no restrictions on the type of armor they could wear, though most donned scale mail or lamellar mail. All Militars were proficient with either the scimitar or khopesh.
The holy symbol of a Militar was a miniature lance.
