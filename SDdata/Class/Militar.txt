'''Militars''' were specialty priests devoted to [[Anhur]], the [[Mulhorandi]] General of Gods.

==Activities==
As with all followers of Anhur, Militars were tasked with defending Mulhorand's traditional borders. Later Militars began countering the weather-controlling magic used by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].

Militars spent much of their time training their martial skills and drilling Mulhorand's legions for combat readiness.

==Culture==
These individuals were extremely vigorous compared to other [[cleric]]s. They shave their heads bald and painted a trio of blue circles on their forehead to indicate their station. Their skin was usually dyed a reddish tint and covered with tattoos of fierce creatures they slew in combat. High-ranking Militars wore jeweled [[gold]] pectoral collars shaped like predators.

==Abilities==
Militars were skilled charioteers. Novice Militars could cast both ''[[stumble]]'' or ''[[command]]'' once per day. Mid-ranking Militars also gained the ability to cast ''[[mage armor|armor]]'' or ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' once per day. Higher ranking Militars could cast ''[[bird of prey]]'' once per day and ''[[thunderstroke]]'' twice per day, and ''[[flame strike]]'' once per day. High-ranking Militars were also extremely proficient with their chosen melee weapon.

==Possessions==
Militars were able to use any weapon of their choosing with the [[lance]] being the only allowed [[polearm]]. There were no restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they could wear, though most donned [[scale mail]] or [[lamellar|lamellar mail]]. All Militars were proficient with either the [[scimitar]] or [[khopesh]].

The holy symbol of a Militar was a miniature lance.
