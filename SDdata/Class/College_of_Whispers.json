They applied their skills judiciously, understanding that subtlety and restraint helped foster a sense of trust within the the minds of their tragers.\nThe College of Whispers did not typically attract those with a strong sense of morality. Fortunately, that was not at all a concern for its members.\nNovices to the College of Whispers learned to strike at their foes psyche whenever they landed struck with their weapons. Similarly, their mere words could cut into a persons mind and instill deep feelings of dread within.\nAs they garnered more experience infiltrating places of power, College of Whispers bards learned how to adopt the personas of the dead. After witnessing someones death, these bards could magically adopt the dead persons shadow as a disguise. They took on the appearance and mannerisms of the deceased, and even acquired some trivial knowledge about their life and personality.\nThe most experienced College of Whispers bards could utter seemingly mundane phrases that granted control over the minds of others.
