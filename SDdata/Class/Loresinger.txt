'''Loresingers''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Milil]] who specialized in storytelling through song.<ref name="WaPotR-p96" >

==Activities==
A loresinger's life revolved around singing and storytelling, or better yet, a combination of both. With their music they hoped to encourage others to strive for greater things. They were well-versed in the history of their surroundings, allowing them to empower their songs with meaning.

==Culture==
All loresingers were either [[human]]s, [[elves]], or [[half-elves]]. They were easily confused with [[bard]]s which was not surprising considering many bards also worshiped [[Milil]].

==Abilities==
A loresinger could not [[turn undead]]. [[Spell]]s from the [[combat sphere]] were denied to them.

==Possessions==
During a performance a loresinger would wear a flowing white shirt with puffy sleeves and green or tan tights. All loresingers wore a short crimson cape embroidered with gold [[dragon]]s. They wore [[leather armor]], but did their best to make it blend in with their clothing. Their preferred weapons were the [[rapier]] and [[main-gauche]].
