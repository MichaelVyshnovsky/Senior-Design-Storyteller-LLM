Loresingers were specialty priests of the Church of Milil who specialized in storytelling through song.
A loresingers life revolved around singing and storytelling, or better yet, a combination of both. With their music they hoped to encourage others to strive for greater things. They were well-versed in the history of their surroundings, allowing them to empower their songs with meaning.
All loresingers were either humans, elves, or half-elves. They were easily confused with bards which was not surprising considering many bards also worshiped Milil.
A loresinger could not turn undead. Spells from the combat sphere were denied to them.
During a performance a loresinger would wear a flowing white shirt with puffy sleeves and green or tan tights. All loresingers wore a short crimson cape embroidered with gold dragons. They wore leather armor, but did their best to make it blend in with their clothing. Their preferred weapons were the rapier and main-gauche.
