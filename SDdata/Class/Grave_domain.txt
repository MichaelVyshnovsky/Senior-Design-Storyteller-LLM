The '''Grave domain''' was a deity domain pertaining to the line between life and death. Deities of this domain were aware of the fundamental importance of death and the [[afterlife]] and regarded the [[undead]] as abominations. Therefore, clerics of this domain were concerned with ensuring peace for the dead and comfort for the dying, as well as delaying death for those that still had great accomplishments ahead of them.

Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[antilife shell]]'' and ''[[raise dead]]''.
