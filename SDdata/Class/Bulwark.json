        "mainbody": "ulwarks were specialty priests of the Church of Helm who served an active defensive role as bodyguards and sentinels.\nThe revenue generated by bulwarks when they were hired for jobs represented most of the income received by the Church of Helm. Bulwarks donated half of their income to the church.\nBulwarks prided themselves on their focus on their duty. Most would not even speak with others while on the job.\nGiven their complete focus on their duty, it was very difficult to sneak up on and surprise them. They could turn undead like normal priests. Bulwarks were also adept at recognizing and utilizing a glyph of warding. Their version of the glyph of warding resembled the eye of Helm and would explode with extremely harmful blue light ripe with magical cold. They could use this power once per day by simply touching their holy symbol.\nMost bulwarks wore full plate mail with an open-faced helm topped with a blue plume. They almost always wielded a two-handed weapon such as a greatsword, polearm, or battleaxe. Both their armor and weapon were donated to them by the church.\nDespite the unpopularity of Helm and his church following the Time of Troubles, bulwarks were eagerly sought for difficult jobs given their reputation as stalwart defenders."
