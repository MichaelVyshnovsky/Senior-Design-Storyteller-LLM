        "mainbody": "'''Vassals of Bahamut''' were devout warriors who revered [[good]] [[dragon|dragons]] & battled [[evil]] [[chromatic dragon]]s wherever they found them. Swearing allegiance to their deity [[Bahamut]], the Lord of Good Dragons, they became his champions in the war against [[Tiamat|Tiamat's]] terrible plans.",
        "Membership": "Although most of Bahamut's champions were [[Metallic dragon|metallic dragons]], some members of the non-[[dragonkind|draconic]] races showed such moral fortitude & opposed evil dragons so fiercely, that he exalted them as his chosen vassals. These dutiful warriors were most often paladins, but some fighters, rangers & even barbarians were known to become worthy of Bahamut's favor.\n\nThis was no easy feat, as before they were sworn in as vassals they had to prove themselves worthy by slaying a [[red dragon]] in single combat.",
        "Activities": "They sought out good dragons to serve, took marching orders from the [[Talons of Justice]], & allied themselves with any morally upstanding individuals that wished to oppose evil dragons. However, vassals have been known to work with dubious characters to oppose or infiltrate groups in service to evil dragons & even Tiamat herself.",
        "Abilities": "Vassals of Bahamut were said to have an imperious aura about them that swayed good dragons to their cause & could even subdue evil dragons without a fight. Yet when it came to battle, these fierce knights struck such savage blows that if a dragon did survive, it would carry the wounds till the end of its days.\n\nThe telltale mark of a vassal was the shining platinum scale mail they wore. Warriors that forged their own armor from the scales of a red dragon had their suit blessed by their deity, as a gift for their service.",
        "Notable Vassals of Bahamut": "* [[Jaerlethket]] was a [[silver dragon]] [[paladin]] of Bahamut and a member of the Talons of Justice. He served as an advisor to King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]."
