'''Stormriders''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Talos]] who exemplified the [[Talos|Destroyer's]] power through their ability to call natural storms.<ref name="WaPotR-p112" >

==Activities==
A stormrider's main goal was to cause natural forms of destruction in Talos' name.

==Culture==
Despite the current weather, a stormrider always look disheveled as if they just walked through a violent maelstrom. They were wild individuals who enjoyed destruction to the point of haphazardly running straight toward dangerous situations.

==Abilities==
Talos granted stormriders access to several [[wizard]] [[spell]]s that could be cast once per day including ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[whispering wind]]'', and ''[[lightning bolt]]''. Once they had gained sufficient favor from Talos a stormrider could attempt to summon a storm or any other weather condition similar to the ''[[control weather]]'' spell. This could be attempted once per week.

Clear skies and generally beautiful weather had a slightly negative impact on a stormrider's psyche, negatively affecting their abilities during combat, casting spells, etc.

==Possessions==
Stormriders wore black clothing and black [[cloak]]s. Their [[holy symbol]] was worn on a chain around their neck. Their weapon of choice was a special [[mace|staff]] made from [[iron]] and wood with a silver ball at the end.
