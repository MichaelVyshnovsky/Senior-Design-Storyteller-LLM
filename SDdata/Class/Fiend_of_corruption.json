        "mainbody": "A '''fiend of corruption''' was a prestigious class of [[evil]] [[outsider]] who specialized in tricking or tempting mortals into embracing the darker aspects of themselves.",
        "Activities": "Fiends of corruption were preoccupied with ensuring that their victims' [[soul]]s would go to the [[Lower Planes]] after death. They sought to establish close, one-on-one or intimate relationships with the mortals whom they sought to corrupt, They particularly delighted in irredeemably corrupting pure individuals or&mdash;if that failed&mdash;luring such people into [[Infernal contract|inviolable bargains]].",
        "Culture": "[[Fiend]]s pursued this specialization in corruption if they already excelled at leading mortals to evil and at twisting good intentions toward their own dark ends.\n\nWhile some fiends corrupted mortals purely out of the spitefulness of their nature, others did so to earn status or infernal wealth while still others did so to amass conscripts for the [[Blood War]] or the granter conflict between evil and [[good]].",
        "Abilities": "They developed a number of [[spell]]-like powers that helped them achieve their dark goals. To get close to their victims, they had the ability to [[alter self|alter their form]] to adopt an attractive or appealing physical appearance, which they used to appear trustworthy if not sexually desirable. They bolstered these disguises with an ability to shield their minds from any attempt to ''[[detect thoughts]]'' or to discern their [[alignment]]. To aid them in starting mortals down dark paths, they further had the ability to [[Suggestion|suggest]] or even to [[Geas/Quest|compel]] mortals to commit evil acts.\n\nFiends of corruption relied heavily on a power to bestow their \"favor\" on a mortal once per day: this provided a powerful enhancement to the mortal's physical or mental capabilities, but it lasted only a day and was followed by a day when the same capabilities were cursed. However, receiving the find's favor again not only resolved the curse, but restored the full boon. The fiends would freely offer this boon to mortals in need, and then capitalize on their suffering  the next day to extract a price. This price would slowly but surely increase over time until the mortal was consumed by their desire for the boon. The most powerful fiends of corruption would then tempt the mortal into an unbreakable contract, often offering them their deepest desires or wishes in exchange for their soul. When such a mortal died&mdash;even in a way hastened by the fiend&mdash;their soul was transferred to a specially prepared [[soul gem|gemstone]] that the fiend took home to their native plane. Such pacts could only be formed by a willing mortal, and could only be broken by the destruction of the gem after their death.",
        "Relationships": "Fiends of corruption tended to work independently from other fiends, whom they found distracted from their goal of forming close relationships with trusting mortals. Occasionally, fiends of corruption would work in pairs, with [[succubi]] or [[erinyes]] bring known to do so.\n\nIt was said that a fiend of corruption may have once taught the secrets of [[graft]]ing flesh to the [[mind flayer]]s, who became avid practitioners of creating [[illithid graft|their own such grafts]].",
        "Notable Fiends of Corruption": "* [[Wendonai]], a [[balor]] in the service of the [[drow]] [[goddess]], [[Lolth]].\n* [[Elinaera]], a [[succubus]] posing as a courtesan at the [[House of Purple Silks]] in [[Waterdeep]].<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|8}}"
