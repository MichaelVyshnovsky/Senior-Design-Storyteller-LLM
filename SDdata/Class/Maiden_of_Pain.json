        "mainbody": "aidens of pain were fanatical followers of Loviatar, the Willing Whip.\nMaidens of pain were usually the most senior female members of a church. These depraved women reveled in all forms of pain. Most were addicted to a liquid drug called agony. Given their intimate relationship with pain, the negative aspects of the agony drug generally did not affect them, though they would suffer withdrawal symptoms if they did not take a dose of the drug on a daily basis.\nSome maidens of pain also possessed the skills of rogues or assassins. They could use their whip to enact any spell that required the caster to physically touch the target. Several times per day a maiden of pain could touch a target and cause instant wracking pain.\nAll maidens of pain carried a whip.\n* Yolanda Shamat"
