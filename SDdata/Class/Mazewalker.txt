Mazewalkers were specialty priests devoted to Ubtao, the Father of the Dinosaurs within the Chultan pantheon.
Mazewalkers maintained the spiritual state of members of their clan, navigating them safely through the "maze" of life. They also served as historians for their tribe, councilors, and peacemakers between other tribes.
They were usually human tabaxi.
Given Ubtaos particular loathing of the undead, mazewalkers were very skilled at turning undead. They were skilled navigators who never got lost within the jungles of Chult. All mazewalkers were immune to the maze and confusion spells. They could cast the following spells once per day analyze balance, mind read, memory read, addition, genius, fire purge, find the path, call dinosaurs, and mind tracker.
Mazewalkers only used blunt weaponry. They did not have armor restrictions.
