Hathrans were an elite class of female spellcasters who ruled over Rashemen. Hathrans were members of the Wychlaran, also called the Witches of Rashemen.
Hathrans developed a bond with their land that gave them exceptional power, as long as they didnt leave their homeland. They had to adopt some strict rules, like wearing a mask to conceal their face when traveling in Rashemen or refusing to craft magic items (an activity that is restricted to the order of male spellcasters). They may have used circle magic. They often spoke freely with spirits and sometimes used their bond outside Rashemen as they grew in power.
Cohort Hathrans had cohorts that were either female ethrans or male barbarians.
Place Magic Hathrans were able to draw upon the power and spirit of Rashemen to cast spells that they had not prepared.
Greater Command Hathrans were granted an ability similar to a quickened greater command.
