'''Hathrans''' were an elite class of female [[spell]]casters who ruled over [[Rashemen]]. Hathrans were members of the [[Wychlaran]], also called the '''Witches of Rashemen'''.

==Description==
Hathrans developed a bond with their land that gave them exceptional power, as long as they didn't leave their homeland. They had to adopt some strict rules, like wearing a mask to conceal their face when traveling in Rashemen or refusing to craft [[magic]] items (an activity that is restricted to the order of male spellcasters). They may have used [[circle magic]]. They often spoke freely with spirits and sometimes used their bond outside Rashemen as they grew in power.

==Abilities==
;Cohort: Hathrans had cohorts that were either female [[ethran]]s or male [[barbarian]]s.
;Place Magic: Hathrans were able to draw upon the power and spirit of Rashemen to cast [[spell]]s that they had not prepared.
;Greater Command: Hathrans were granted an ability similar to a quickened ''[[greater command]]''.
