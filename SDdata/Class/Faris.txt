A '''faris''' ({{plural|farisan}}; {{Gender|f|farisa}}) was a holy [[Warrior#2nd edition|warrior]] of [[Zakhara]].<ref group="note">Farisan was a [[Warrior#2nd edition|warrior]] class kit for the [[Al-Qadim]] setting.

==Requirements==
Farisan had no special requirements, though the vast majority of these warriors were good-natured.

==Role==
Farisan were the mortal champions of their gods. This level of devotion went beyond that of even [[paladin]]s as paladins leaned toward fighting for good and law. The will of a faris's god (and church) took priority above all other matters. A faris also played an important role in recruiting followers to their god's path.

Holy warriors went out of their way to aid others fighting for their gods. Goods, services, supplies, and shelter were just a few benefits that could be expected.

Farisan were obedient followers of their god's church. As such they were expected to carry out orders from their superiors even in the face of certain death.

==Equipment==
All armor and weapon types were available to farisan. Additionally, they usually carried the holy symbol of their chosen god.
