A '''painbearer''' was a [[specialty priest]] of [[Ilmater]], the Crying God.<ref group="note">After initially being presented as an unnamed specialty priest for 2{{nd}} edition in ''Forgotten Realms Adventures'', this class was named "painbearer" and gained a number of powers when it reappeared in ''Faiths & Avatars''. The name was reused in the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide'' for 4{{th}} edition, but applied to all [[cleric]]s of Ilmater. Therefore, this article focuses on the 2{{nd}}-edition information for the painbearer.

==History==
Specialty priests of Ilmater were simply called "clerics", like other [[cleric]]s, around [[1358 DR]]. The name "painbearer" was in use by [[1369 DR]], by which time they had gained additional powers.

By [[1479 DR]], however, all priests of Ilmater were called "painbearers".

==Relationships==
As specialty priests, painbearers were naturally included among the ranks of the Adorned, the clergy of the [[church of Ilmater]].

==Entry==
Painbearers were required to be quite hardy, in addition to being wise. Later, they also needed skill in healing and to be of a [[lawful good]] disposition.

==Culture==
Some painbearers trained at the [[Convent of St. Rhynda]] in [[Tethyr]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Possessions==
Painbearers learned to wield bludgeoning weapons as well as the [[scourge]]. However, they did not wear [[armor]].

==Abilities==
Painbearers learned techniques and gained greater endurance to help them undergo hardships, weather suffering, and resist pain and even drowning. A painbearer could also go without food and water for several [[tenday]]s and, though weakened, they would not die of starvation or thirst during this time. However, the painbearer was still afflicted by hunger pangs and thirstiness, which they simply had to endure as a matter of course for their faith.

Painbearers also learned the arts of herbalism. They could brew [[potion]]s with healing effects earlier than other clerics, beginning with the ''[[potion of healing]]''. 

With a touch, a painbearer could [[remove fear]] and dispel magics that negatively affected the emotions of others to cause pain, suffering, or despair. This worked on two other people a day, and later the painbearer could also perform it on themselves once a day.

As divine spellcasters, painbearers could gain major access to the [[sphere]]s of [[All sphere|All]], [[Charm sphere|Charm]], [[Creation sphere|Creation]], [[Guardian sphere|Guardian]], [[Healing sphere|Healing]], [[Necromantic sphere|Necromantic]], and [[Protection sphere|Protection]], with [[Law sphere|Law]] and [[Travelers sphere|Travelers]] following later. They could also gain minor access to the spheres of [[Combat sphere|Combat]], [[Elemental sphere|Elemental]], [[Summoning sphere|Summoning]], [[Sun sphere|Sun]], and [[Weather sphere|Weather]], with [[Wards sphere|Wards]] added later.

As they advanced, later painbearers learned to cast a number of spells outside their normal spellcasting: ''[[draw upon holy might]]'' (without need for rest), ''[[favor of Ilmater]]'', and ''[[endurance of Ilmater]]''. They could also [[commune]] with Ilmater.

The highest painbearers could, when enduring great suffering, torture, or extreme punishment, beg a good servant to Ilmater to aid them. This servant possessed the painbearer and took on all the pain they suffered, though none of the injury, for the duration of the ordeal. The servant was also unable to move the painbearer's body.

Early painbearers could not turn or command [[undead]] creatures.

==Notable Painbearers==
Some known painbearers were:<ref group="note">All these known painbearer characters have "Painbearer" as a title, suggesting that all painbearers adopt this as a title, unless the Painbearer title is distinct from the painbearer class, ''i.e.'', a regular cleric may be titled "Painbearer".
