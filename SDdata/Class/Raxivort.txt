Raxivort () was a very low-power demigod and the originator of xvarts.
Raxivort resembled a xvart of great hideousness (even for a xvart). His skin was bright blue and his eyes glowed with orange light. Raxivorts avatar could also take the form of a rat,
He typically wore silken garments over blue chainmail, all of which shimmered as if aflame. He carried small, bladed weapons such as knives and daggers, as well as a small unique falchion, the Azure Razor.
Before his demigod status, Raxivort was a treasurer for Grazzt. He eventually betrayed him by stealing some of this treasure and fleeing to the material plane. One of the items he stole was the Infinity Spindle, a crystal shard from the early times of the multiverse that could transform creatures into gods.
In order to hide his whereabouts while on the prime plane, Raxivort spawned creatures that were his exact physical duplicate. This was the creation of the beings known as xvarts.
One of his more direct actions against Grazzt included causing a massive rat infestation in Fogtown, Zelatars neighborhood on the 45 layer of the Abyss, and the Queens Causeway, the undermarket connecting Fogtown to Gallenghast, Zelatars neighbourhood on the 46 layer of the Abyss. This infestation made life there difficult and extended to practically every building and was hard to combat. The Night Flutterer had the rats under his control and could direct them as he wished.
After leaving the Abyss, Raxivort forged a realm known as the Black Sewers in Pandesmos, the top layer of Pandemonium.
