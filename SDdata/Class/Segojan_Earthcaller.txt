Segojan was closely allied with all of the [[Lords of the Golden Hills]], with the exception of Urdlen. Aside from gnomish gods, Segojan was most closely allied with other deities of [[:Category:Earth domain deities|earth]] and [[:Category:Nature domain deities|nature]], and to a certain extent, [[:Category:Death domain deities|death]].

His central foe was [[Urdlen]], for Segojan's domain was most threatened by the Crawler Below. His other enemies were [[Cyric]] and [[Abbathor]].

==Worshipers==
[[File:Earthcaller symbol.jpg|thumb|''Holy symbol of Segojan Earthcaller.'']]
The highly organized [[Church of Segojan]] was prominent within most [[rock gnome]] communities. In conjunction with the Church of [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], they worked to protect and preserve the natural world, especially below the surface. With the Church of [[Flandal Steelskin]] they oversaw the safety of mining operations, and with the Church of [[Callarduran Smoothhands]] they sought to forge ties between settlements of [[svirfneblin|deep gnomes]] in the [[Underdark]] and rock gnomes on the surface.

==History==
Segojan was one of the oldest of the Lords of the Golden Hills, and he once oversaw many aspects of gnomish life that were later the preserve of other deities, such as nature in general (which was later divided with [[Baervan Wildwanderer]]), mining (which passed to [[Flandal Steelskin]]), jewelry-making (which passed to [[Garl Glittergold]]), and magic (which passed to [[Baravar Cloakshadow]]).

It was also said that in ancient times, it was Segojan who gifted [[rock gnome]]s with their ability to speak to burrowing animals.
