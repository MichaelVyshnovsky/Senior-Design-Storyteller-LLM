They were often practiced in non-combat trades such as smithing or other forms of crafting.\nBy studying their foes in combat, battle masters could glean information about their martial capabilities. They could get a good sense for how strong or dextrous their opponent was, or how near they were to succumbing to their wounds.\nBattle masters developed special attacks or other moves they utilized in combat, known as maneuvers. Each battle master had enough endurance to perform a few of these specialized moves each day, and developed the capacity for more as they garnered more experience in battle. Known battle master maneuvers included\n* Commanding directions that allowed an ally to stroke against an opponent.\n* Evasive movements that made them harder to strike.\n* A rallying cry that bolstered the spirits of allies.\n* Defensive moves to parry away or counter incoming attacks.\n* A broad sweeping attack that struck multiple foes.\n* Attacks that could disarm, distract, push away, or frighten their foes."
