'''Trailblazers''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Marthammor Duin]], the Watcher Over Wanderers.

==Culture==
Nearly all trailblazers were [[shield dwarves]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, both male and female, could become a trailblazer.

==Abilities==
Trailblazers were skilled trackers and mountaineers who rarely got lost. They were completely immune to any [[magical]] or mundane attacks based on electricity or lightning.

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, trailblazers could cast ''[[free action]]'', ''[[pass without trace]]'', ''[[spiritual hammer]]'', ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[haste]]'' without suffering the effects of aging, ''[[clear path]]'', and ''[[hovering road]]'' on a daily basis. Additionally, they could cast ''[[find the path]]'' at will.

==Possessions==
Trailblazers did not have restrictions on the type of [[armor]] they were allowed to wear. However, they were permitted to only wield bludgeoning weapons in combat.
