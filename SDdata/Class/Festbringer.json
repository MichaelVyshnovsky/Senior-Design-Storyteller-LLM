        "mainbody": "Festbringers were specialty priests of the Church of Lliira who served the Joybringer by organizing celebrations and keeping track of holidays.\nThese joyous individuals realized that they could help alleviate the stife and strain of life in Faer√ªn through celebration and mirth.\nA festbringer always saw the joy in even the darkest situation provided it was not life-threatening. They seemed obsessed with laughter and parties, but this was caused by their view of how dark the Realms could be and their attempt to liven things up for those around them.\nFestbringers were up to date on all of the latest customs regarding dances and celebrations. Their long years of partying boosted their inner reserves, allowing them to maintain activity long after sleep would have claimed most individuals. They could use a version of the command spell up to three times per day. Festbringers usually used this power on anyone attempting to crash a party by commanding them to dance or perform a similar joyous activity. They also had an uncanny ability to know the precise date, otherwise a holiday might escape their notice.\nFestbringers could not turn undead.\nFestbringers rejected wearing armor or carrying weapons in favor of dressing like they were attending a lavish party. Women preferred flowing gowns while men donned fancy tunics and pants. Yellow and orange were the predominant themes for their dress."
