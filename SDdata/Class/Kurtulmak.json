        "mainbody": "The Devourer Steelscale Stingtail Gnomesmasher \nKurtulmak () was the patron deity of the kobolds they believed he gave them life and taught them how to survive by stealing, looting, and pillaging. Kobolds often had to compete with gnomes for living space, which fueled an eternal conflict between the races. Kurtulmak was always enraged that the more militarily organized and competent gnomes won most of these clashes over territory.\nKurtulmak was the sworn enemy of Garl Glittergold and the other gnome gods.\nKurtulmak removed himself from infernal politics and was careful to stay out of the way of beings stronger than himself. Various archdukes attempted to curry his favor as an ally in their constant power struggles, and he would accept any and all aid with a gracious smile. He would then proceed to rob them blind, all while fronting as an ally against other powers. \nKurtulmak rarely admitted to his followers that his resident plane had any other major inhabitants, and when forced to admit the truth, he admonished his followers to heed his example regarding forces beyond ones control.\nKurtulmak is mentioned in the Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, where he is called the first kobold & first of the dragonspawn. According to the document, around , Kurtulmak was leader of the kobold nation Darastrixhurthi, a vassal-state in service to his creator, the green dragon Caesinsjach. When the kobolds began enslaving the newly created gnomes & stealing the gemstones that contained their unborn souls, Garl Glittergold intervened by collapsing the mountain Darastrixhurthi was built in (this collapsed mountain eventually became known as the Shadow Sea in Netheril).\nMost of the kobolds died, including Kurtulmak, & most of the survivors were killed by Caesinsjach herself, who had been driven mad by the first Rage of Dragons. The dragonwrought kobold Kuraulyek had been ordered to watch for the returning Caesinsjach so that he could warn his people, but instead he escaped with his urds, settling in what would become known as the Thunder Peaks.\nThe dragon god Asgorath tried making amends for the destruction his children created by raising Kurtulmak to divinity. The newly reborn kobold deity saw Kuraulyek as a traitor & vowed revenge but Asgorath deified him as well so that the remaining survivors of both dragonspawn races, the kobolds & the urds, would have protectors to guide them.\nThis tale may be somewhat apocryphal, however, since other sources place the First Rage of Dragons five hundred years prior to the creation of the urds.\nKurtulmaks rise to divinity is the most venerated legend in kobold society, though each tribe might differ slightly in telling it. It seems to confirm some of what was written in the Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, however, it is rather biased in favor of the kobolds & their deity, while making a caricature of their gnome enemies.\nThe legend says Kurtulmak was the first kobold, the largest of his race, & their leader. He obediently served his creator, the dragon Caesinsjach, & when she commanded her kobolds to mine the mountains & gather wealth for her, Kurtulmak invented the pickaxe, taught himself sorcery & minted gold coins in the image of his mistress.\nCaesinsjach became the wealthiest dragon of all & in reward for his excellent service, she freed Kurtulmak & the rest of her kobold servants. They followed their heroic leader as he founded his own lair, dug the most advanced mine yet seen to uncover vast riches, & created a fortress fit for dragons called Darastrixhurthi. Apparently the gnome deity Garl Glittergold was envious of the achievements the kobolds had made, which dwarfed those of his own people. Out of spite, he cruelly collapsed the kobold fortress, massacring them all.\nThe gods were furious but took no action against Garl, The Trickster, who claimed it was all just a joke. Only The Ninefold Dragon, Asgorath took pity on the kobolds & sought restitution on their behalf. He saw that even buried by rubble, Kurtulmak still clung to life, the heroic kobolds soul still fought to free his people. So Asgorath gave Kurtulmak a choice, he could either return to life with the strength to rebuild his fortress, or he could step into divinity & become his peoples hero for all time.\n* According to another legend, Garl Glittergold stole something from Tiamats hoard, & Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve it. Unfortunately for the kobold, the trickster god lured Kurtulmak into a system of caves, which Garl escaped from & collapsed, leaving Kurtulmak trapped for eternity.\n* Another myth says Kurtulmak stole the gift of sorcery from a dragon deity to give to his people."
