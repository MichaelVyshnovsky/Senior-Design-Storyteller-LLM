        "History": "Kurtulmak is mentioned in the ''[[Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants]]'', where he is called the first kobold & first of the [[dragonspawn]]. According to the document, around {{Yearlink|-24500}}, Kurtulmak was leader of the kobold nation [[Darastrixhurthi]], a vassal-state in service to his creator, the [[green dragon]] [[Caesinsjach]]. When the kobolds began enslaving the newly created [[gnome]]s & stealing the gemstones that contained their unborn souls, [[Garl Glittergold]] intervened by collapsing the mountain Darastrixhurthi was built in (this collapsed mountain eventually became known as the [[Shadow Sea]] in [[Netheril]]).\n\nMost of the kobolds died, including Kurtulmak, & most of the survivors were killed by Caesinsjach herself, who had been driven mad by the first [[Rage of Dragons]]. The [[dragonwrought kobold]] [[Kuraulyek]] had been ordered to watch for the returning Caesinsjach so that he could warn his people, but instead he escaped with his [[urd]]s, settling in what would become known as the [[Thunder Peaks]].\n\nThe [[dragon]] god [[Asgorath]] tried making amends for the destruction his children created by raising Kurtulmak to divinity. The newly reborn kobold deity saw Kuraulyek as a traitor & vowed revenge but Asgorath deified him as well so that the remaining survivors of both dragonspawn races, the kobolds & the urds, would have protectors to guide them.\n\nThis tale may be somewhat apocryphal, however, since other sources place the First Rage of Dragons five hundred years prior to the creation of the urds.",
        "Rumors and Legends": {
            "Ascension of Kurtulmak": "Kurtulmak's rise to divinity is the most venerated legend in kobold society, though each tribe might differ slightly in telling it. It seems to confirm some of what was written in the ''[[Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants]]'', however, it is rather biased in favor of the kobolds & their deity, while making a caricature of their gnome enemies.\n\nThe legend says Kurtulmak was the first kobold, the largest of his race, & their leader. He obediently served his creator, the [[dragon]] Caesinsjach, & when she commanded her kobolds to mine the mountains & gather wealth for her, Kurtulmak invented the pickaxe, taught himself [[sorcerer|sorcery]] & minted gold coins in the image of his mistress.\n\n[[Caesinsjach]] became the wealthiest dragon of all & in reward for his excellent service, she freed Kurtulmak & the rest of her kobold servants. They followed their heroic leader as he founded his own lair, dug the most advanced mine yet seen to uncover vast riches, & created a 'fortress fit for dragons' called [[Darastrixhurthi]]. Apparently the gnome deity [[Garl Glittergold]] was envious of the achievements the kobolds had made, which dwarfed those of his own people. Out of spite, he cruelly collapsed the kobold fortress, massacring them all.\n\nThe gods were furious but took no action against Garl, The [[Trickery domain|Trickster]], who claimed it was all just a joke. Only The Ninefold Dragon, [[Asgorath]] took pity on the kobolds & sought restitution on their behalf. He saw that even buried by rubble, Kurtulmak still clung to life, the heroic kobold's soul still fought to free his people. So Asgorath gave Kurtulmak a choice, he could either return to life with the strength to rebuild his fortress, or he could step into divinity & become his peoples' hero for all time.\n\n* According to another legend, Garl Glittergold stole something from [[Tiamat]]'s hoard, & Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve it. Unfortunately for the kobold, the trickster god lured Kurtulmak into a system of caves, which Garl escaped from & collapsed, leaving Kurtulmak trapped for eternity.\n* Another myth says Kurtulmak stole the gift of sorcery from a dragon deity to give to his people."
