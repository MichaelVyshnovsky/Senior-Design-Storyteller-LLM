        "mainbody": "Barbers were rogues who plied their trade and honed their skills in the bazaars of Zakhara.Barber was a rogue class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.\nAll types of rogues could be barbers. However, some Moralistic areas of Zakhara required female barbers to only service other females.\nBarbers were masters of the street. Elaborate showmen, these rogues possessed quick wits and sharp tongues. Any gold they couldnt talk a customer out of could always be stolen by deft hands. These men and women were always a good source of gossip or for obtaining serious information.\nAll kinds of equipment were available to barbers, but they almost always had access to a full barbering kit with a sharp razor.\nBarbers were adept and figuring out the functions of magical items.\nBarbers lacked experience in many skills common to other thieves because they had to spend so much time mastering their barbering crafts, sometimes even attending formal classes."
