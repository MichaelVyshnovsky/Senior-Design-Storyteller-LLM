        "mainbody": "'''Oberon''', called the '''Lord of Beasts''' or sometimes '''King Oberon''', was a member of the [[Seelie Court]] worshiped as a [[deity]] of the wilderness and animals. He was at other times known as '''Oran''', and under that name was called the '''Green Lord'''.",
        "Description": "Oberon appeared as a wingless, unusually tall and muscular male faerie. His eyes were black and wild, his hair thatched and braided and run through with brambles, and his skin was comparable in color to oak wood. He was known to wear a cloak of green leaves stitched onto brown leather.",
        "Personality": "Oberon was a stern protector and warrior, if wild and mercurial at times. He relied less on illusion and camouflage than other members of the Seelie Court, and was unafraid of physical combat.",
        "Abilities": "Oberon's avatar had a number of spell-like abilities, being able to use ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[detect charm]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[forget]]'', ''[[goodberry]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[speak with animals]]'', ''[[obscurement]]'', and ''[[pass without trace]]'' (although even without magic he was nigh undetectable when in undergrowth) at will; thrice each day he could use ''[[animal summoning I]]'', ''[[Animal summoning II|II]]'', and ''[[Animal summoning III|III]]'', ''[[call woodland beings]]'', ''[[conjure animals]]'', and ''[[creeping doom]]''. He was immune to [[poison]], [[disease]], ''polymorph'' effects, and [[death magic]], and was also highly resistant to magic in general. Nonmagical weapons could not harm him. Furthermore, no natural woodland animal, faerie creature, or sentient, nonevil plant creature could be compelled to harm him.\n\nOberon himself was attuned to [[Feywild|fey]] forests he often roamed, able to both sense and affect every tree and stream. He was an unrivaled hunter and warrior, powerful enough that even [[Corellon]] treated him with a cautious respect there.",
        "Possessions": "King Oberon possessed a staff that could be used as a [[changestaff]] once per day, as well as a magicked [[longsword]] that could be used to cast ''[[light]]'' or ''[[continual light]]'' as willed, and ''[[sunray]]'' once a day. His [[longbow]] was no less magical, capable of turning up to 20 normal arrows into magicked ones each day. He was also known to carry [[arrow of slaying|arrows of slaying]] for [[orc]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[goblin]]s, as well as another twenty arrows specially enchanted to inflict nonlethal damage, that he used when hunting stags.",
        "Divine Realm": "Like the rest of the Seelie Court, Oberon dwelled in their [[Seelie Court (divine realm)|collective divine realm]], which drifted between the planes of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], [[Arborea]], and [[Ysgard]]. Oberon himself often roamed the Beastlands and [[Arvandor (layer)|Arvandor]] while hunting. At other times, the Lord of Beasts could be found living in the [[Feywild]].",
        "Activities": "The Lord of Beasts spent much of his time away from the Seelie Court roaming the Beastlands and Arvandor, or protecting various sylvan realms from incursion or attack by rapacious monsters or humanoids. One of his favorite activities was hunting stags, but he did not kill the animals he hunted.\n\nHe was one of the [[archfey]] known in [[Faer√ªn]] to make pacts with warlocks.",
        "Relationships": "Oberon was the consort of [[Titania]] and the father of [[Damh]], and presumably the father of [[Verenestra]] and the [[Prince of Frost]] as well. However, his relationship with Queen Titania was legendarily tempestuous: at times they were the dearest of lovers, at other times rivals, and at yet other times both. He was also the father of the archfey [[Selephra]],<ref>{{Cite dungeon/185/Court of Stars: The Bramble Queen|57}} and the archfey [[Hyrsam]] had been \"born\" from music he wrought long ago.<ref>{{Cite dragon/422/Hyrsam, Prince of Satyrs|4-6}}\n\nWith the rest of the Court, Oberon was allied with the [[Seldarine]], as well as various good deities of nature and hunting.\n\nHe was, like the rest of the Seelie Court, an enemy of the [[Goblinoid pantheon|goblinoid]] pantheon and the hag goddess [[Cegilune]], but most particularly the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], whom he often urged Titania to war against.\n\nHe was also the leader of the faction of fey called the [[Green Fey]], which was primarily composed of wilder, more nature-oriented fey such as [[satyr]]s, [[dryad]]s, and [[treant]]s, as well as some [[elf|elves]] that dwelled in the Feywild. Other archfey of the Green Fey, such as Damh and Selephra, also answered to him.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/185/Court of Stars: The Bramble Queen|60}}",
        "History": "Oberon was ancient, and was said to be the awakened spirit of a nature, possibly of some great forest. He was known to be part of the Inner Circle of the Seelie Court, and was present for their court and later flight in the realm of Ladinion.\n\nThe Green Lord was the one to craft Titania's palace of [[Senaliesse]] from living wood.<ref>"
