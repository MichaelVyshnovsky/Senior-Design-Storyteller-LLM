        "mainbody": "'''Drow wanderers''' were skilled [[drow]] who eschewed their race's traditions to wander the depths of the [[Underdark]]. These unusual drow may have been either [[good]] or [[evil]], having cast aside the way of their people to seek freedom in the darkness. Solitary and alone, these individuals honed themselves to excellence in order to survive the many terrors that were common below the surface world.",
        "Culture": "Most who wandered the dark caverns within the Underdark considered it a horrific and forbidding place, filled with unspeakable monstrosities and deadly horrors. Even most drow were unwilling to negotiate the twisting maze of tunnels. By contrast, drow wanderers not only lived but thrived in the Underdark. \n\nPart of their skill came from untapping the heritage of their race, turning the curse that ensnared their race into a strange blessing that gave them a special affinity for the pervading darkness of the world below. More importantly was the special care that drow wanderers took to train their pathfinding abilities, which allowed them to navigate the Underdark with relative ease.",
        "Abilities": "Drow wanderers could acquire their skills from a variety of sources and came from diverse backgrounds such as [[cleric]]s, [[fighter]]s, or [[wizard]]s. They were united solely by their race, their ability to survive the Underdark, and their rejection of [[Lolth]] and her ilk. As such a drow wanderer charged their abilities with [[arcane magic|arcane]] or [[divine magic|divine]] power, among other sources. Some of them were simply unusually skilled [[warrior]]s with an uncanny knowledge of underground locations.\n\nHowever, all drow wanderers displayed some supernatural abilities, many of which drew on those of the drow race. Drow wanderers took advantage of those struck with their innate ''[[darkfire]]'' ability to deal more lethality with their attacks. Similarly, drow wanderers had an uncanny sense for the stones around them, giving them an edge on most races that saw the underground world as strange and alien. They also possessed more mundane skills, such as their expertise at setting up ambushes.\n\nDrow wanderers could conjure a ''[[darkblade]]'' , taking advantage of the ''[[cloud of darkness|clouds of darkness]]'' that most drow could create. This allowed wanderers to fuse their weapons, granting them the power to temporarily blind their enemies. Drow wanderers could draw upon ''[[strength in darkness]]'', which allowed them to self-heal through the power of [[shadow magic|shadow]]."
