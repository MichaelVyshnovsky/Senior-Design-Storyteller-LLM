        "mainbody": "Profitprophets were specialty priests of the Church of Waukeen who preached about the Golden Ladys return while also undertaking sucessful business ventures. In reality, Lliira was the one answering the profitprophets prayers.\nProfitprophets did everyting in their power to keep Waukeens traditions alive. They spent much of their time and money investing in business opportunities.\nWaukeens faithful profitprophets refused to accept that Lliira was granting their spells.\nProfitprophets were skilled in determining the quality of gemstones, making it easy for them to spot a fake. They were also extremely accurate to within 5% when estimating the value of any item or service. Profitprophets could turn undead.\nThese priests dressed in the finest clothes with the hopes of showing others that Waukeens graces were still strong.\nPalpable friction existed between the profitprophets and the Church of Lliira after the Joybringers faithful assumed control of the Church of Waukeen and the rest of her clergy. This tension often lead to outbreaks of violence even in public places."
