They were required to complete difficult heroic quests in order to advance their station.\nParagons were completely loyal to Torm and took any vows with extreme devotion. All paragons were human.\nParagons shared all of the abilities of a paladin save for their spell abilities. They also shared all of a paladins weaknesses.\nParagons wore white plate mail polished to a glistening shine. Large white helmets and sky-blue cloaks completed their ensemble. They usually did not carry a shield since most wielded either a two-handed sword or a bastard sword with two hands."
