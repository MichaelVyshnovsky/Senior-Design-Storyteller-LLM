Windriders were specialty priests of the Church of Shaundakul who ministered to traders, explorers and adventurers travelling through Cormanthor.
Windriders aided those who were lost or in need but also protected Myth Drannor from looters. They only revealed themselves to be followers of Shaundakul once it was apparent that others needed their help or needed to be stopped. They never left the borders of the sacred elven forest.
These individuals were either humans or half-elves. Most windriders realized that Shaundakul was not as powerful as he used to be, which gave them an air of sadness that quickly turned to rage when faced with looters or desecrators.
Windriders were able to turn undead and cast spells that druids had access to.
Windriders preferred wearing leather armor wrapped with dark green cloaks. They usually wielded a longsword and shortbow. They wore their holy symbol beneath their clothing.
