Eshebala was the patron goddess of the werefoxes, as well as being a goddess of charm, vanity, greed, and cunning.
Eshebalas avatar took the form of either a werefox in her vixen (hybrid) form, or the form of a charming and lovely elven maid. In either case she wore rich jewellry and other finery, and carried an ornate silver mirror with which to admire herself.
She was wiley, cruel, and exceptionally vain. When "hunting" on the Prime Material plane, she preferred to overcome her victims with subtlety rather than force.
Eshebalas avatar was noted to be immune to poison, and enchantment and illusion magic, and could not be injured by nonmagical weapons. In rural areas she innately passed without trace, and in underbrush had a 95% chance of going wholly undetected. Akin to a wolfwere, she could cause lethargy by singing akin to foxwomen she could use charm person at will. Because of that last ability, she was always accompanied by 2-5 charmed male servitors.
Her avatar was known to use an enchanted longsword in combat. In her divine realm, she had a collection of gems and jewellry, furs and skins, objets dart, and other such things this collection actually vulgar and flashy rather than tasteful.
Eshebala lived on the 193 layer of the Abyss, Vulgarea.
Eshebala was known to visit the Material plane in avatar form out of boredom. On such trips, she would visit females she had infected with lycanthropy for gossips sessions, during which she expected to be the center of attention and flattery. She would also "hunt" for sport she particularly enjoyed capturing handsome males with illusion and charms before immobilizing them, dispelling the charm, and then carving their flesh off with a silver dagger and eating it.
Eshebala was the sister of Daragor, the god of werewolves and seawolves she regarded her brother as an oaf but did not actually hate him. She dwelled alone save for her charmed servitors and had no known allies.
She did, however, loathe the weretiger-goddess Ferrix, who was also vain and charming, and the tanarri and other Abyssal natives for their ugliness, brutishness, and/or stupidity.
Eshebala was, first and foremost, the goddess of the foxwomen.  She would also show favor to wolfweres because of their hatred of werewolves, though whether or not the creature worshiped her in return was unclear.
Despite Eshebalas loathing of tanarri, some tanarri priests were known to pledge themselves to her service. And some members of The Fated revered Eshebala as well.
