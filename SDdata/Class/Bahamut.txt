'''Bahamut''' ({{Pronounce|ba|HA|mut|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}} Before entering the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], he was a member of the [[Draconic pantheon]], as a deity of good dragons, [[metallic dragon]]s, wisdom, and enlightened justice (justice tempered with mercy and punishment with forgiveness) known by the name of '''Xymor''' ({{Pronounce|ZIE|more|refs=}}). For some time, he was also a member of the [[Untheric pantheon]], under the alias of [[Marduk]].

His natural form was that of a [[platinum dragon]], said by many to be the only one of his kind. He was also the eternal rival of his sister [[Tiamat]], queen of the [[chromatic dragon]]s. 

==Description==
[[File:Bahamut Spellfire.jpg|thumb|250px]]In his natural form, Bahamut was a massive dragon approximately {{SI|180|ft}}, with a tail the same length as his body, (said by some to be virtually indestructible) that glowed with a faint blue sheen,{{Cite polyhedron/73/Bahamut and Tiamat|19}} and blue eyes, the exact color of which was hard to specify and may have depended on Bahamut's mood.

[[File:Grand Master of Flowers AFR.jpg|thumb|200px| ''Bahamut in his Grand Master of Flowers persona.'']]When he wished to wander the [[Prime Material Plane|mortal world]], he usually took the appearance of an old [[human]] or [[demihuman]] [[wizard]] dressed in peasant robes accompanied by seven canaries{{Cite web/The Legends of Adventures in the Forgotten Realms}} This persona came to be known among mortals as '''[[Fizban]] the Fabulous'''. Some sages believed Bahamut used this humanoid guise to not frighten non-dragon beings. They also believed that while Bahamut was fond of his old man guise, he had other guises as well. Other recorded guises included that of a prince with a carriage drawn by seven horses, an urchin accompanied by seven friends, a beggar followed by seven dogs,{{Cite MTG|AFR|282|{{MTGc|Grand Master of Flowers||AFR|#=282}}|[[Yongjae Choi]]}} a [[Grandmaster of Flowers|title]] that was also used by the monks of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].

===Diet===
Bahamut's favored food was the early morning frost on blades of [[grass]], [[honey]], and daisy petals. He was able to eat anything, however, and he needed no sustenance while in his palace.

==Personality==

Bahamut was stern and very disapproving of evil, always arguing with [[Asgorath]] about his crusade against it. He accepted no excuses for evil acts, and didn't tolerate even minor offenses by evil creatures.

In spite of his stance, he was also considered one of the most compassionate beings in the multiverse. He had limitless empathy for the downtrodden, the dispossessed, and the helpless. although it was also said that Bahamut loathed to sully himself with the blood of evil creatures.

By draconic standards, Bahamut was neither vain nor desirous of treasure. He valued wisdom, knowledge, prophecies, and songs instead. He used the great wealth he had amassed over the ages to help those in need, while using the [[magic item]]s he had gathered to further his goals. However, he also pursued viciously (usually sending his champions and followers) those who tried to steal the hoard from his palace as, after all, he was a god of justice.

Bahamut also liked to prove the strength and worthiness of his followers by battling against them in his dragon form, halting the combat when his followers were injured or when they overcame him. However, he was prone to get carried away by his zeal, and had powerful healers on hand in case he had gravely injured one of his followers in those battles.

While his court comprised only gold dragons, Bahamut enjoyed the company of all good dragons, delighting in their differences and varied personalities.

==Powers==
[[File:Bahamut_p59.jpg|thumb|250px|''Bahamut in his dragon form.'']]
Bahamut disdained combat, and he preferred to talk with his opponents and convince them to surrender using his legendary diplomatic skills. Bahamut spoke many languages, including [[Draconic language|Draconic]], [[Celestial language|Celestial]], [[Auran]], and [[Common]], although he had the ability to speak to any intelligent creature thanks to his ever-present, receptive form of [[telepathy]]. 

Despite his aversion to battle, he was easily capable of defending himself. Along with all the standard powers and godly senses of a deity of his rank, as well as the natural abilities of an ancient dragon, those who saw him fight claimed that he had two breath weapons, one a powerful ''[[cone of cold]]'', the other a vapor that turned his enemies into gaseous forms. A third special attack was his roar, which was so powerful that it could ''[[disintegrate]]'' creatures or objects within 100 feet (30 meters). If facing off against more powerful creatures, this roar would still permanently deafen those who weren't turned to dust. He was also capable of breathing the holy winds of Mount Celestia, which allowed him to heal his allies and even resurrect his fallen comrades. On top of that he was more powerful than any mortal dragon, and was also reputed to know every [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] spell. Few things in the mortal world could cause him lasting harm.

Also, Bahamut had the ability to [[see invisibility|see invisible]] beings and objects, and to breathe underwater indefinitely. Likewise, he could freely use his breath weapons or cast spells while underwater.

===Aspects===
[[File:Aspect of Bahamut.jpg|thumb|250px|''An aspect of Bahamut.'']]
Bahamut was able to create [[aspect]]s of himself from the willing sacrifice of a powerful metallic dragon worshiper. While the dragon died during the ritual, the newly created aspect remembered all of its previous life and was utterly bound to Bahamut's will forever after. Unlike normal divine aspects of other gods, aspects of Bahamut were not extensions of Bahamut's self but rather independent beings. They were not as powerful as Bahamut's normal avatars, however.

Bahamut disliked creating aspects in this way, as he preferred that his dragon worshipers remained as dragons rather than sacrifice themselves, but he sometimes asked one of his dragon worshipers to become an aspect when it was needed, to act as an emissary, to become a long-term guardian, or to chase evil beings way too powerful for his mortal followers to face. 

Occasionally, aspects of Bahamut arose spontaneously on Celestia or a closely related plane. Unlike Bahamut's normal aspects, these spontaneous aspects were short-lived, biological echoes of Bahamut's divine will. These aspects usually faded to nothingness within a day. These aspects were usually the ones who answered the magical summons of Bahamut's worshipers.

According to some sages, aspects of Bahamut physically combined elements of all kinds of metallic dragons, and were big enough to tower even the greatest of the mortal ancient dragons. Aspects of Bahamut were fearless, surprisingly intelligent combatants who cared nothing for their continued existence, something that made them far more dangerous than mortal dragons because of their coldly calculated rage and battle acumen. Aspects of Bahamut usually fought to the death unless their existence was more important than any tactical gain they could get from a battle. Despite this, aspects of Bahamut were more willing to converse with mortals and deal diplomatically with them than most divine aspects, though they only spoke from positions of superiority due to them as representatives of the Platinum Dragon.

==Realm==
{{See also|Bahamut's Palace}}
Myths claimed that the great fortified castle that Bahamut called home was somewhere "behind the east wind" and many scholars believed Bahamut's castle was located on the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].{{Cite dragon/272/The King and Queen of Dragons: Bahamut &amp; Tiamat|30}} However, "[[Bahamut's Palace]]" was actually located on the [[plane]] of [[Celestia]]. 

==Activities==
[[File:Bahamut4e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Bahamut's dragon and human forms.'']]
Bahamut spent half of his time traveling the [[Prime Material plane|Material plane]]'s many worlds (including [[Toril]], [[Krynn]]{{Cite adventurers league/Into Darkness|6-9}} in the guise of an old man. Some said that Bahamut had visited every known world and plane during these travels at least once in his lifetime. When Bahamut assumed the form of the old man, he was usually accompanied by seven gold great wyrms polymorphed into canaries or some other small animal form, always ready to attack anyone foolish enough to threaten their god. 

He spent the rest of his time holding court in his shining palace on Celestia. Good-aligned [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s usually took pilgrimages to his castle, seeking to receive the blessings of the Platinum Dragon.  

Bahamut was ever watchful against the machinations of Tiamat, However, when he confronted her, he always took the necessary actions to stop the spread of her influence and to undo whatever damage she had done. 

Bahamut was unable to turn his back on any good creatures that were in need, however, even if Tiamat wasn't involved. Even so, he preferred to help them in indirect ways, such as giving them useful information, needed advice that bordered on prophecy, a safe refuge or healing, and bolstering them with his powerful magic. 

==Relationships==
Bahamut's allies included good dragons, [[half-dragon]]s, dragonborn (both Abeiran and ancient ones), and good draconic creatures.

Bahamut was a servant deity to Torm, occupying an equivalent position to that of a knight.

Bahamut's antithesis was Tiamat,

===Servitors===
As Bahamut was active in the Material plane, he needed less divine servants than other deities. The best known of his few [[exarch]]s was [[Kuyutha]], a dragonborn [[demigod]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

===The Seven Gold Wyrms===
A council of seven ancient gold dragons comprised Bahamut's court. They were Bahamut's closest servants and friends. Each one worked on specific tasks, and served as Bahamut's emissaries in tasks that didn't demand the god's personal attention. They also advised Bahamut on matters of honor and acted as a jury when the god was judging evildoers—often apprehended by his champions.

Some claimed these wyrms were reincarnations of dead kings, renowned for their sense of justice and returned to life to serve the Platinum Dragon. Gold dragons, however, believed that Bahamut chose among the most noble and courageous among them to serve him in this capacity, and they considered a position in his court to be the most prestigious of all. According to gold dragon traditions, Bahamut chose them through secret, elaborate, and dangerous tests that challenged their mettle. Once appointed to a position in his court, that gold dragon served Bahamut until dead or until it was too old or infirm to aid their god.

It was unknown if there was some form of hierarchy among them.

As of the 15{{th}} century DR, the Seven Gold Wyrms were [[Borkadd]] the Claw, [[Kurya]] the Eye, [[Sonngrad]] the Wing, [[Gruemar]] the Voice, [[Marroshok]] the Tail, [[Troannaxia]] the Presence, and [[Urgala]] the Fang.

==Worshipers==
{{Quote|Leave me blind to all but true light of justice, o Valiant One.|A basic prayer to the Platinum Dragon.}}
[[File:Bahamut.jpg|thumb|250px|''Bahamut in flight.'']]
The majority of Bahamut's worshipers prior to the Spellplague were metallic dragons. While he was revered by all good dragons, gold, [[silver dragon|silver]], and [[brass dragon]]s held him in particularly high regard.

His worship grew in the decades following the [[Time of Troubles]], when he regained his divine status, as non-dragons began to take interest in his teachings.

Followers of Bahamut often took quests to oppose the schemes of Tiamat and to stop or destroy her followers. They were allies of worshipers of Torm, [[Moradin]], [[Yondalla]], and other lawful good deities.

===Clergy===
Bahamut accepted only clerics of good alignments. Whether they were dragons, dragonborn, half-dragons, or other beings attracted to his philosophy, clerics of the Platinum Dragon always had to strive to take constant but subtle actions on behalf of good while trying to do as little harm in the process as possible.

Dragon clerics were usually nurtured from birth, trained by a senior dragon cleric, usually a parent or close friend of their parents, although it was not unusual that a dragon of any age heard the call of Bahamut and sought out clerical training. As with any dragon deity, dragons who wanted to become clerics of Bahamut had to first acquire an appropriate holy symbol. This holy symbol became the most prized item of their hoards after that, as it was a symbol of their status in dragon society and of the cleric's devotion to Bahamut, and to lose it was considered a blasphemy. If a dragon cleric didn't try to recover a stolen or lost holy symbol, he or she would lose their investiture. Usually a dragon had to acquire his or her holy symbol on their own, but Bahamut also bestowed a holy symbol to a dragon he wanted to be his cleric.{{Cite dragon/86/Dragons and their deities|36-37}} 

The holy symbol used by dragon clerics of Bahamut was a small dragon claw (about the size of a human hand) usually made of platinum or some other metal plated with platinum, although younger (and relatively poorer) dragons made theirs of their own metal type. They carried their holy symbol at all times, usually around their necks on a stout chain. One of the main goals of a dragon cleric was to acquire their most preferred type of holy symbol; in the case of Bahamut's worshipers, this was one made of platinum. In some instances, Bahamut blessed some of his clerics for services rendered by upgrading their holy symbol to one made of platinum.

Bahamut was known to work with his clerics more often than other dragon deities, and he asked his clerics to oppose the greatest weaknesses of dragonkind, which in Bahamut's point of view were the tendency of good dragons to perform questionable acts because of greed or cowardice, the chance to be subdued (something all dragon gods frowned upon), and the existence of evil dragons.

Like the dragon clerics of the other dragon deities, clerics of Bahamut were expected to perform three key functions alongside any other tasks he asked them to do: to act as role models for other good dragons, to function as emissaries of Bahamut in a given area, and to spread Bahamut's will to other dragons in that area while collecting sacrifices from Bahamut's worshipers. Those sacrifices were usually a small part of their dragon hoards, and dragon clerics were allowed to take a small share of this sacrifice as well, making this third function the favorite of many dragon clerics. Dragon clerics were also expected to sacrifice a part of their treasure to Bahamut once every year.

If a dragon cleric transgressed Bahamut's dogma, committed questionable acts, or was subdued, either voluntarily or by force, he or she would lose favor with him and would need to atone by sacrificing part of their treasure or by performing special tasks, or they would lose part of their clerical powers. Repeated transgressions would earn them the loss of all their clerical abilities, a merciful punishment compared to how other dragon gods, such as Tiamat, punished their failed clerics.

Non-draconic clerics of Bahamut typically learned his teachings at the foot of a wyrm, usually a gold or silver dragon in humanoid form. Teacher and student often traveled to see the effects of injustice and cruelty firsthand.{{cite book/Complete Divine|108-109}} Bahamut's wanderings gave rise to many bard tales about an unassuming old man with canaries who helped people on the roads that were well known among his faithful, and many of his human and demihuman priests undertook pilgrimages in the company of trained canaries, seeking to emulate their god.

===Orders===
The [[Talons of Justice]] was an order of dragon paladins dedicated to Bahamut that followed the Ptarian Code. No one knew exactly how many Talons there were, but the group probably numbered in the scores. Group members were spread throughout Faerûn, many living in [[human]] and [[demihuman]] form in cities and towns of other races.

The [[Platinum Cadre]] was an order of dragonborn knights from Tymanther who believed that not all dragons were evil, and that dragonborn were the [[dragonborn of Bahamut|ancient children of Bahamut]]. They worked actively to change Tymantheran prejudices about dragons, and although they were ridiculed by Tymantheran society, they were also acknowledged as some of the best warriors Tymanther had to offer, even if grudgingly.

===Temples===
Temples to Bahamut were extremely rare, as the Platinum Dragon didn't appreciate being honored by objects, taking into account deeds instead. Many gold, silver, and brass dragons maintained small shrines to Bahamut in their lairs, usually nothing more than Bahamut's holy symbol engraved on a wall.

The few temples that were made to honor him were beautiful and elegant buildings with simple furniture and no embellishment or adornment. Those temples had meeting rooms where followers could gather to plan their next campaign against Tiamat, and a few smaller rooms where individuals could pray, meditate, or rest in privacy.

===Dogma===
Bahamut's dogma was based on justice, nobility, protection, honor, mercy, and just authority.{{Cite dragon/378/Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms|37}}

His dragon adepts followed the Ptarian Code, a draconic code of honor created by the gold dragon [[Ptaris]] in the ancient past. Originally intended as a code of conduct for the lords who attended the King of Justice, the Ptarian Code eventually was adopted by many gold and silver dragons. The Ptarian Code was similar to the codes of chivalry adopted by knightly orders of humanity. It included paying homage to Bahamut, as well to the draconic deities Lendys and Tamara. The major precepts were:
[[File:Acolyte of Bahamut.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''An acolyte of Bahamut, praying at his shrine.'']]
* ''Justice and Good above all.''
* ''Honor and Fealty to the King.''
* ''Honor and Respect to Righteous Innocence.'' 
* ''Honor and Duty to the Balancer (Lendys), to Her Mercy (Tamara), and to the Justicemaker (Bahamut).'' 
* ''Honor and Protection to the Lesser Races.'' 
* ''Honor and Correction to the Enemies of Justice and Good.'' 
* ''Honor and Forbearance for oneself.''

===Rites===
Bahamut's worshipers and clergy had no formal rituals or ceremonies. Those who followed the Platinum Dragon believed in the philosophy of "praying through their deeds". The only activity that was considered as something like a ritual was the ''[[Rite of Rebirth]]'', the magical process by which non-dragon humanoids transformed themselves into dragonborn.

==History==
For ages, sages debated whether Bahamut actually was a deity or not. Many believed he was the archetype of good dragonkind, the avatar of another deity, or even a mortal dragon so powerful that other dragons revered him like a god. Whatever he was, sages knew for certain that he was powerful, was venerated by many good dragons as their king, and was even respected by evil ones.

===Origins===
[[File:Symbol of Bahamut - Dennis Crabapple McClain.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''An earlier holy symbol of Bahamut, before becoming a member of the Faerûnian pantheon.'']] According to sages of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Bahamut was actually a god. He came into existence alongside the rest of the draconic pantheon when the first dragons were born,

His actual origins were highly conflicting, however, as there were many accounts about how he came into being. In the more commonly accepted traditions, he was the son of Asgorath and brother of Tiamat and [[Null]]; Myths from the [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]] claimed instead that Bahamut and Tiamat were born from the sundered corpse of Io (the name by which dragonborn knew Asgorath) when he was killed in the [[Dawn War]]. According to the ancient draconic myth ''[[Elegy for the First World]]'', Bahamut and Tiamat both coalesced from the primordial chaos at the beginning of time.

Whatever the truth, his cult grew rapidly in the communities of metallic dragons, especially among young gold dragons.{{Cite polyhedron/73/Bahamut and Tiamat|20}}

===Creation of the First World===
According to ''Elegy for the First World'', after Bahamut and Tiamat awakened from the primeval chaos they partnered and worked together to create a world, that later was known as the Prime Material plane, but in the poem was known as the ''First World''. After the creation of the ''First World'', they created the dragon god [[Sardior]] to help them to create the rest of the dragonkind: the first [[metallic dragon|metallic]] and [[chromatic dragon]]s. When the gods of the Outer Planes came to invade the ''First World'', Bahamut resisted and opposed them, but was defeated by the combined might of the gods. When Bahamut recovered he began to travel the Material Plane to try to understand the different gods of the Outer Planes and their creations, while mourning Tiamat after she was imprisoned. After the destruction of the ''First World'' Bahamut fled to Mount Celestia, where he was accepted as one of the gods of that plane. 

===The Dragonfall Wars===
Once dragons as a race had established themselves during the [[Time of Dragons]], the various religious factions of dragons began to battle one another over their different ideologies, in what is known as the [[Draco Holy Wars]]. Although this conflict never degenerated into outright violence, religious intolerance became quite widespread among gold dragons, something that had no precedent until that time and never happened since.

Over time, religious fervor waned and draconic philosophers came to the conclusion that gods who allowed such behavior were not worthy of their worship. This started the draconic apathy towards their gods that lasted for thousands of years. The followers of Bahamut and Tiamat didn't lose their faith toward their gods, however, and continued fighting in what was known as the [[Dragonfall War]].

To combat Tiamat's [[dragonspawn|aberrant creations]], Bahamut created powerful draconic humanoids known as the ''[[dragonborn of Bahamut|Ux Bahamuti]]'', who served as his emissaries in the mortal realm during the first years of the war. The ''Ux Bahamuti'' were somehow related to the dragonborn native to Abeir; however, how they were related was a secret known only by a few older dragons.{{cite web|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|title=Ed's Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/722271292758585344|accessdate=2016-04-18}}

The war waxed and waned in intensity, with the last era of intense fighting occurring between {{Yearlink|-2087}} and {{Yearlink|-1071}}. It was during this time that the [[Unther]]ic empire began and with it, their pantheon became prominent. Bahamut became part of that pantheon by taking the alias of Marduk, one of the Untheric greater deities. A second front in the Dragonfall War opened and the two dragon gods fought each other personally, with neither being able to gain the upper hand.

In −1071 DR, in a battle of the [[Orcgate Wars]] known as the [[Battle of the Gods]], while [[Gilgeam]] fought with [[Ilneval]], Tiamat saw her chance to strike, but before she could kill the God-king, Marduk intervened and killed her, saving Gilgeam's life at the expense of his own. With both of their Untheric aspects dead, Tiamat and Bahamut were both stripped of their divine power. Marduk's church was eradicated and Bahamut was reduced to the status of [[celestial paragon]].

===Return of the Dragon King===
He was forced to stay like this, without enough followers to worship him as a god, living in the [[upper planes]] However, at some point before the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Bahamut was trapped in an ancient prison somehow related to the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]''.

In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, after the destruction of [[Sammaster]] and the end of the [[High Magic]] that sustained the ''Dracorage mythal'', Bahamut was able to free himself from his prison and reappeared in Celestia, and soon after launched an invasion of Tiamat's demesne in [[Dragon Eyrie]].

With the renewed faith in him, Bahamut began preparing for a renewal of the Dragonfall War as Tiamat had regained her status as a lesser deity thirteen years prior. He gifted his most devout followers with the ability to turn themselves into dragonborn of Bahamut, so that the war could continue between mortals again.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, lightning and meteor showers pounded Faerûn, and Bahamut and Tiamat instructed their respective followers to seek out such sites as they would each contain some form of dragon egg. Unfortunately for Bahamut, Tiamat's followers were much more effective in retrieving the eggs than his own.

In the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, after the [[Spellplague]] had wreaked havoc in the planes, a group of demons led by the [[balor]] lord [[Axithar]] invaded the [[House of the Triad]], and when [[Tyr]] and Torm sent calls for help, Bahamut answered by sending his legions to aid in destroying the demons.

Afterwards, Bahamut became part of the Faerûnian pantheon when Torm promoted him to the same position Torm once occupied while serving Tyr, becoming a temporary member of [[the Triad]],{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|92}} replacing Tyr until his return after the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s DR. He also gained a few followers among the dragonborn of [[Tymanther]].

After Tiamat's failed attempt to escape from [[Avernus]] in the late years of the 1480s [[DR]], Bahamut sent the [[copper dragon]] [[Balarystul]] to that plane to keep an eye on the activities of Tiamat's followers.
