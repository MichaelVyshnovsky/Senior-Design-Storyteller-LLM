They often participated in the games as well, though they remained constantly aware if anyone was cheating.\nLuckriders used chance in their daily lives even more so than the favored.\nThey were extremely skilled at detecting if someone around them was trying to cheat. They would lose access to all of their spells for a full day if they ever cheated during a game of chance.\nThey wore simple black robes with their holy symbol worn on a chain around their neck."
