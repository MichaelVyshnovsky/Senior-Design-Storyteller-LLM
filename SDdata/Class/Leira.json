Motes of her divinity coalesced into incorporeal beings known as [[Glamer (outsider)|glamers]].{{Cite dragon/299/The Dragon's Bestiary}}\n\nSome still believed Leira was alive and that she had used her death as a grand illusion, but the general consensus was that she was a dead power.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it became known that Leira was in fact alive and delighted in the confusion created by rumors of her demise and return. At this time, the faithful of Cyric also considered her to be his daughter."
