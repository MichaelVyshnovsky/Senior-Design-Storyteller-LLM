Lone wolves were specialty priests devoted to Fenmarel Mestarine, the Lone Wolf.
Lone wolves were elves or half-elves, with the majority being green elves.
Their survival skills in the wild rivaled those of rangers.
In addition to their normal spells, lone wolves could cast entangle, pass without trace, blur, obscurement, barkskin, spike growth, tree shape, plant door, hallucinatory forest, charm monster, commune with nature, wall of thorns, transport via plants, creeping doom, and acid storm once per day.
Lone wolves used a variety of weaponry including blowguns, clubs, daggers, darts, hand axes, knives, slings, quarterstaves, short bows, and staff-slings. For armor, they wore leather armor or hide armor and some carried a wooden shield.
