Holy slayers were elite assassins within Zakhara who meted out justice based on a specific set of principles and beliefs. Often, just the knowledge that a holy slayer was operating nearby was enough to dissuade those who opposed their goals or beliefs.Holy slayer was a thief class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.
Holy slayers were always thieves. Bards were not allowed to become holy slayers. These individuals could be male or female, but some of the holy slayer organizations only had members of one sex. The Soft Whisper was an all-female organization, and the Wind of Fate was all male. Examples of other groups were the Wrath of the Old, the Storm Which Destroys, and the Grey Fire.
Holy slayers had as many restrictions as paladins. They were utterly devoted to their organization, literally created to follow the orders of their Grandfather or Grandmother. All holy slayers were expected to sacrifice their lives if called upon to do so. Grandfathers and Grandmothers often used this devotion to show their power by having holy slayers jump off a building to prove their worth. Any holy slayer who disobeyed a direct order became an outcast, and was hunted down and killed.
Holy slayers could operate out of the base of their chosen organization, or dwell among regular citizens while waiting for direct orders or "The Call."
Holy slayers could use any one-handed weapon. Most of the different organizations specialized with a certain type. They often carried an array of virulent poisons, which were only used as a secondary option. Any fool could poison someones wine holy slayers were elite killers who preferred to get up close and personal with their victims.
Holy slayers could specialize in the use of one weapon just like a fighter, so long as the weapon was the favored choice for their organization. Some are listed below
* Soft Whisper jambiya
* Wind of Fate blowgun 
* Wrath of the Old dagger
* Storm Which Destroys longsword
* Grey Fire javelin
The biggest shortcoming of being a holy slayer was their short lifespan.
