        "mainbody": "'''Surtur''',",
        "Description": "Surtur looked like an immensely large fire giant with crackling flames in place of hair and eyebrows.",
        "Possessions": "Surtur's signature weapon was a [[greatsword]], wreathed in flame and {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} in length. He was also known to wear [[iron]] armor that was incredibly hot.",
        "Realm": "Surtur ruled [[Muspelheim (realm)|Muspelheim]]. In the [[World Tree cosmology]] this ever-burning realm was part of the [[Neutral Plane]] of [[Jotunheim]] and was connected by a [[portal]] to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].  In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] it was located on the fiery second layer of the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]]; the layer was also called [[Muspelheim]], named for Surtur's realm. In addition, Surtur shared the realm of Jotunheim on the [[Ysgard (layer)|layer of Ysgard]] with [[Thrym]], where the Lord of the Fire Giants resided in the ancient hall of [[Meerrauk]].",
        "Worshipers": "Nearly all of Surtur's worshipers were giants. A select few members of other races were known to have earned his approval, but they concealed their devotion to the giant lord.\n\nSurtur taught that [[fire]] was pure, cleansing, and strong. The weak and impure burned, while the strong survived. Fire was useful as a tool, but must be respected. It was dangerous when uncontrolled.\n\nSurtur's temples in the lands of men were hidden affairs. Those that were not hidden were huge buildings ringing with the sounds of forges and storing weapons in preparation for the battle at the end of the world. Visitors had only a few seconds to prove their intentions before the fire giants attacked. Fire giants did not enjoy leaving witnesses to their activities.",
        "History": "Surtur, a son of [[Annam]], was part of the second generation of giantish deities, born at about the same time as [[Skoraeus Stonebones]] and [[Thrym]]."
