Doommasters were particularly wicked specialty priests devoted to Beshaba, the Maid of Misfortune.
Doommasters helped spread the fear of Beshaba by working mysteriously to ensure those around them donated to the Church of Beshaba to avoid experiencing bad luck. They satisfied their own sadistic appetites in whatever manner they saw fit upon those who refused to acknowledge Beshabas influence.
These individuals gained a variety of magical abilities as their powers grew including Tashas hideous laughter, bane of Beshaba, misfire, probability control, lower resistance, and misfortune. Each of these spell-like abilities could be used once per day. Particularly powerful doommasters could cast a version of Mordenkainens disjunction once per tenday.
A doommaster could concentrate Beshabas ill luck on a single individual on a daily basis, causing the target to experience a quick streak of misfortune that affected them immediately. The doommaster glowed red while using this ability. Also on a daily basis, a doommaster could perform the opposite feat upon themselves and sidestep an event of bad luck that would have affected them.
Doommasters wielded bludgeoning weapons during combat. They were permitted to wear armor as heavy as plate mail and sometimes carried a shield.
