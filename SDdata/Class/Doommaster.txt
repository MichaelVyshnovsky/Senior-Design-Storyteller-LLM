'''Doommasters''' were particularly wicked specialty priests devoted to [[Beshaba]], the Maid of Misfortune.

==Activities==
Doommasters helped spread the fear of Beshaba by working mysteriously to ensure those around them donated to the [[Church of Beshaba]] to avoid experiencing bad luck. They satisfied their own sadistic appetites in whatever manner they saw fit upon those who refused to acknowledge Beshaba's influence.

==Abilities==
These individuals gained a variety of magical abilities as their powers grew including ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]], [[bane of Beshaba]], [[misfire]], [[probability control]], [[lower resistance]]'', and ''[[misfortune]]''. Each of these [[spell]]-like abilities could be used once per day. Particularly powerful doommasters could cast a version of ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'' once per tenday.

A doommaster could concentrate Beshaba's ill luck on a single individual on a daily basis, causing the target to experience a quick streak of misfortune that affected them immediately. The doommaster glowed red while using this ability. Also on a daily basis, a doommaster could perform the opposite feat upon themselves and sidestep an event of bad luck that would have affected them.

==Possessions==
Doommasters wielded bludgeoning weapons during combat. They were permitted to wear [[armor]] as heavy as [[plate mail]] and sometimes carried a [[shield]].
