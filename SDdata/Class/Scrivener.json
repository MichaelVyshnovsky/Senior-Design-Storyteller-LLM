        "mainbody": "'''Scriveners''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Thoth]], the Lord of Magic within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].",
        "Activities": "A scrivener's time was spent studying the various aspects of [[magic]] and its applications. Some served as scribes or librarians.",
        "Culture": "These individuals were always [[human]]s of [[Mulhorandi]] heritage. They were skilled [[wizard]]s as well as [[priest]]s.",
        "Abilities": "''[[Read magic]]'' and ''[[read southern magic]]'' were the first [[spell]]s they learned upon becoming scriveners. They could ''[[discern lies]]'' all the time if they could hear a conversation and were focusing on detecting any lies. They could perform a number of magical abilities on a daily basis including ''[[speak with birds]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[fly]]''. Additionally, they could cast ''[[commune]]'' once per tenday. Particularly powerful scriveners could create [[magic item]]s without suffering any permanent ill effects. This could be done three times per year. A scrivener's intelligence and wisdom grew as their skills progressed.",
        "Possessions": "Scriveners did not wear [[armor]]. The only weapons they had a degree of familiarity with were [[dagger]]s, knives, [[dart]]s, and [[staves]]."
