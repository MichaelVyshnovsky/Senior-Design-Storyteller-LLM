        "mainbody": "uccaneer was a term used to refer to rogues who dedicated their lives to piracy and the high seas. When legally sanctioned by a nation to perform their piracy, they were known as privateers.\nThe behaviors and attitudes of buccaneers often overlapped with the bandits of land, such as desperation, cruelty, fiendish cunning, and a likelihood for internal squabbling.\nSometimes buccaneer ships made alliances and cooperated to raid richly-laden mercantile vessels. Rivalries sometimes developed between buccaneer groups, especially when one carried a wealthy cargo of treasure. They tended to have secret sanctuaries where they would rest, store their provisions and treasure, and plan further acts of piracy.\nIn interior Faerûn, buccaneers could be found in the Sea of Fallen Stars, particularly in the Pirate Isles but occasionally showing up in the Dalelands and the port city of Ravens Bluff. In south Faerûn, there were a great deal of Dambrai half-drow buccaneers plying the Great Sea. \nIn west Faerûn, buccaneers could be found in much of the Trackless Sea, with many silver elves using this way of life to benefit Evermeet. Buccaneers of the Trackless Sea often made port at the city of Skullports Port district to take leave from their prolonged stays at sea, frequenting establishments such as the Broken Pike, the Crock and the Helm, and Skin-Deep Tattoos.\nBuccaneers eschewed many of the typical skills of thieves in favor of those befitting a sailor, such as navigating, swimming, and general seamanship. They often favored being able to decipher the secret codes that sometimes adorned maps. And they were particularly known for being adept at climbing and fighting on the ropes or rigging of ships.\nBuccaneers typically dressed in a manner befitting sailors, eschewing any sort of armor as they preferred to to be light on their feet and because it would prove troublesome in water. Their choice of weaponry was also typical of sailors, such as cutlasses.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, buccaneers of the Pirate Isles were one of the main threats facing the isle of Snowdown.\nIn 1370 DR, in the month of Ches, a great deal of buccaneer crews in Skullport mutinied or nearly mutinied after not having leave for months.\n* Akbet-Khrul.\n* Briney Valesaris, a half-elf buccaneer.\n* Carreigh Macumail, captain of the privateer vessel Mist-Walker.\n* Lanyard O the Sail."
