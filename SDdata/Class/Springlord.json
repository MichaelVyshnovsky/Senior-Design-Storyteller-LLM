        "mainbody": "Springlords and springladies were specialty priests of the Church of Lathander who epitomized the pure aspects of renewel.\nThey often served as healers, midwives, and provided services such as raising the dead.\nSpringlords performed their work to honor Lathander, often performing expensive tasks such as resurrection even if someone could not afford their services. They would only do this once per individual though. They disliked praise of any kind and were the least structured of the Morninglords clergy.\nSpringlords were artistic individuals who used their talent to praise Lathander. Springlords were skilled in all aspects of normal and magical healing. They could not cast spells from the combat sphere.\nSpringlords preferred robes of Lathanders traditional colorsâ€“yellow, pink, and red. The color green was used to trim the sleeves, hem, and collar and signified renewal. The heaviest armor a springlord could wear was chainmail. They wielded clubs, staves, or slings during combat."
