They were stalwart defenders, and served as the main line of defense along the border of the Deep Realm, the area underneath the Great Rift that connected it to the Underdark.\nThese elite dwarven fighters excelled at fighting in the tight, narrow corridors of the Underdark. Once they held ground in a narrow passageway, they were nearly unmovable."
