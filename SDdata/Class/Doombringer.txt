'''Doombringers''' were bastions of vengeance and righting injustices. These specialty [[priest]]s devoted themselves to [[Hoar]], the Hurler of Thunders.

==Activities==
As with other members of Hoar's clergy, Doombringers often spent their time travelling around, offering prayers to Hoar on the behalf of those who sought vengeance. Doombringers also helped those who suffered grave injustices.

==Abilities==
Though they could not [[turn undead]] like other priests, doombringers could attempt to [[command undead|command]] nearby [[undead]].

Doombringers could incite a focused rage upon a specific being on whom they sought vengeance. The rage made it much easier for the doombringer to strike and harm their targets, and resist the effects of any magical attacks directed at them from the same targets. Once held within the grip of their rage, a doombringer would relentlessly attack until the target was killed or incapacitated.

Doombringers were capable of exercising a [[prayer of revenance]] if they were present when someone who sought vengeance died. The prayer would cause the deceased to rise as a [[revenant]] so they could exact their vengeance in the afterlife.

Any doombringer killed in an unjust manner would always rise from their grave as a revenant. The difference between these creatures and regular revenants was that the undead doombringer was not always susceptible to harm from fire.

Doombringers gained a wide variety of magical abilities as they gained power. These included being able to use ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[hand of Hoar]]'', and ''[[thunder staff]]'' on a daily basis.

Especially powerful doombringers had a permanent aura that acted like the ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'' [[spell]].

==Possessions==
Doombringers were not restricted in the type of [[armor]] they wore. All doombringers were proficient in the use of a single blunt, slashing, and piercing weapon. They always carried one of each kind of weapon in order to exact vengeance on anyone who caused them harm with the same type of weapon.
