'''Maidens of pain''' were fanatical followers of [[Loviatar]], the Willing Whip.

==Culture==
Maidens of pain were usually the most senior female members of a church. These depraved women reveled in all forms of pain. Most were addicted to a liquid drug called [[agony (substance)|agony]]. Given their intimate relationship with pain, the negative aspects of the agony drug generally did not affect them, though they would suffer withdrawal symptoms if they did not take a dose of the drug on a daily basis.

==Abilities==
Some maidens of pain also possessed the skills of [[rogue]]s or [[assassin]]s. They could use their [[whip]] to enact any [[spell]] that required the caster to physically touch the target. Several times per day a maiden of pain could touch a target and cause instant wracking pain.

==Possessions==
All maidens of pain carried a whip.

==Notable Sacred Fists==
