        "mainbody": "ommoners were average folk who made up the bulk of Torils people. Commoners were responsible for farming the fields, staffing the shops, and performing most of the labor and production in their societies. They usually had no taste for risk like adventurers, and were quite happy to avoid such nonsense.\nCruel lords who sought to mistreat and oppress their people would find that the common folk had a sharp limit to their toleranceâ€”and serfs and slaves had even less. Even if only armed with knives and clubs, a sufficiently angered population of commoners could overthrow a kingdom."
