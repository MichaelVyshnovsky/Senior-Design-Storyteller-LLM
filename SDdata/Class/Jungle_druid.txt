'''Jungle druids''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Ubtao]], the Father of the Dinosaurs within the [[Chultan pantheon]].

==Activities==
They taught the various jungle tribes how to fit in with their role in jungle life, sometimes assuming the role of clan leader.

==Culture==
Jungle druids were usually [[human]] [[Tabaxi (tribe)|tabaxi]].

==Abilities==
In addition to possessing all of the abilities of "common" [[druid]]s, jungle druids were extremely knowledgable regarding [[dinosaur]]s. They also usually spoke several of the languages of the native creatures living in the area. They were very skilled at moving through the thick jungles of [[Chult]] without leaving a trail. They could ''[[shapechange]]'' into a normal [[reptile]], small dinosaur, or [[bird]] once per day per creature type.

==Possessions==
They used a variety of weapons including [[dart]]s, [[blowgun]]s, [[club]]s, ''[[kerrie]]'', [[scimitar]]s, [[spear]]s, and ''[[yklwa]]s''. [[Armor]] usually consisted of [[Hide armor|dinosaur hide]] or [[padded armor]] and their [[shield]]s were usually non-metallic.
