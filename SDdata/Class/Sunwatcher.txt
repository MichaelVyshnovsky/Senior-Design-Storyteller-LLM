'''Sunwatchers''' were [[priest]]s of the [[Azuposi]] people of the [[Pasocada Basin]] who tracked the sun through the seasons.<ref name="CoG-pA9-A10" >

==Activities==
These priests performed a variety of rituals and ceremonies throughout the year to keep the Azuposi people within the sun's graces. Their duty kept them busy at all times, preventing them from traveling or adventuring.

==Culture==
A sunwatcher connected his people to the mighty sun, which was considered to be the most powerful spirit by the Azuposi.

==Abilities==
Sunwatchers were skilled in the use of [[talismanic magic]]. They could not [[turn undead]].

==Possessions==
Sunwatchers wore a white and gold poncho that signified their status. They wielded [[spear]]s, [[short bow]]s, and [[dagger]]s, all of which were sanctified during a special ceremony before use. The spear and short bow represented the piercing rays of the sun to a sunwatcher.
