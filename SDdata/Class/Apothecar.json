        "mainbody": "pothecars were specialty priests of the Church of Mystra whose primary duty was the identification of potions, salves, ointments, and elixirs.\nAn apothecars extended exposure to bizarre chemicals and substances often made them look strange and disheveled, sometimes even with apparent burn marks or stains upon their skin. Most were also rather eccentric due to prolonged inhalation of fumes.\nAll apothecars were either humans, gnomes, or half-elves. They were a proud group of priests who often served Mystra for generations.\nSkilled apothecars could usually identify a substance just by smell or taste.\nGiven the amount of time spent researching potions and similar substances, apothecars dedicated very little effort to martial skills, resulting in them being weaker individuals who were clumsy with weapons.\nApothecars could not turn undead.\nThey wore the traditional blue robes of Mystras clergy with their holy symbol worn around their neck."
