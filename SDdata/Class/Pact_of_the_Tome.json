        "mainbody": "he Pact of the Tome was a type of pact between a warlock and their patron in which the former was gifted a grimoire of spells, known as a Book of Shadows, in recognition of faithful service.\nWarlocks who pursued this type of pact had the ability to conduct an hourlong ritual to manifest a Book of Shadows (and in the process dispose of a lost or damaged older tome) which granted them access to expanded magical knowledge.\nSome warlocks could also manifest new pages in the book, upon which others could write their names in order to bind themselves to the warlock in specific ways. These might include granting the warlock the ability to stay in contact with them by inscribing a message on the page (which would be transmitted to the signatory via a sending spell) or by offering special protection should they become grievously injured. A warlock could freely erase a name from their Book of Shadows, and was limited in the number of names that they could manage at a time.\nAdditionally, some bearers of a Book of Shadows gained the eldritch ability to stay awake in perpetuity, perhaps merely poring over their Book of Shadows rather than needing to sleep. Such warlocks also became immune to any magical compulsion to sleep.\nThe signature Book of Shadows contained cantrips that no warlock might otherwise know without the generosity of their patron. The warlock was able to cast these spells as long as the Book was on their person.\nThe appearance and design of a Book of Shadows was determined by the patron, The Book disintegrated into ash if the warlock was slain.\nFarideh, a tiefling warlock active around Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR, was said to carry a Book of Shadows given to her by her patron. She used it to drain the life from her enemies."
