'''Sea druids''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Deep Sashelas]], the Lord of the Undersea.

==Culture==
All sea druids were [[aquatic elves]], [[half-sea elves]], or [[malenti]].

==Abilities==
They were resistant against lightning-based attacks. They spoke many of the languages of other sea creatures including [[koalinth]]s, [[merfolk]], [[sahuagin]], etc. They were immune to any ''[[charm person|charm]]'' [[spell]] cast by other seafolk. Sea druids could ''[[shapechange]]'' into any normal-sized [[fish]], sea [[reptile]], or sea mammal three times per day.

==Possessions==
Sea druids wielded [[trident]]s, [[net]]s, [[spear]]s, [[dagger]]s, or [[knives]]. For [[armor]] they wore either [[sea elven scale mail]] or [[sea elven shell mail]].
