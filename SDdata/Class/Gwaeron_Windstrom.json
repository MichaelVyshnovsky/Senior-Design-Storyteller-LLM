        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Gwaeron was known to manifest as or through a wide variety of woodland creatures, as well as [[pseudodragon]]s and [[faerie dragon]]s, either individually or as a group. Other manifestations included a nimbus of ''[[faerie fire]]'' or a bare human footprint with a faint impression of his symbol visible in the heel print."
        },
        "Personality": "Like his divine associates, Gwaeron was an advocate of [[Druid#Culture|the Balance]] of nature. He was quiet, reclusive and taciturn, preferring to teach through action rather than words, but while he was slow to anger, his rage was terrifying once invoked. Regular targets of this wrath were [[troll]]s, creatures that he so utterly despised that in his hatred for them he personified the very concept of a [[ranger#Abilities|species enemy]]. He considered them kin of [[Malar]] and a blight that would inevitably upset the Balance in the long term.<ref name=FaP-pp96-97/>",
        "Powers": "After taking his legendary abilities as a ranger into consideration, Gwaeron's tracking abilities were still well beyond what one of even his level of skill and wisdom would normally be capable of. He had no rival in discovering the most obscure of woodland signs and finding paths several weeks old.\n\nGwaeron could cast ''wind walk'' and imbue ''[[natural attunement]]'' with his touch, both at will, as well as grant favored followers ''natural attunement'' by manifesting as a footprint the moment before they stepped in it. He could cast ''[[shroud of flame]]'' as a powerful [[wizard]] every minute in addition to his normal capabilities, as well as various other [[spell]]s normally.\n\nTrolls were particularly vulnerable to Gwaeron's attacks.",
        "Possessions": "Gwaeron was proficient in all weaponry but specialized in the use of [[two-handed sword]]s and [[composite longbow]]s.\n\nGwaeron's personal melee weapon was ''[[Flameheart]]'', a ''+1'' ''[[flame tongue]]''. Flameheart had a ''+2'' enchantment against regenerating creatures, ''+3'' against creatures that were avian, inflammable or harnessed the cold, and ''+4'' against [[undead]].\n\nHe also possessed a ''+3'' composite long bow and a [[quiver]] that provided an inexhaustible supply of [[arrow]]s. These included normal [[sheaf arrow]]s and ''[[arrow of slaying|arrows of slaying]]'' that worked against any sentient mortal who ever desecrated a forest without repentance. The arrows retained their magic only in his hands, save for the occassional cases when he bestowed one to a ranger on a specific quest to defend the forest against a specific enemy.",
        "Realm": "It was debatable whether Gwaeron's home plane was the [[Prime Material Plane]] or the [[House of Nature]]; he could freely wander both, though he had realm of his own there, and his \"realm\" on [[Toril]] was [[Faerûn]] as a whole.<ref>\n\n[[Image:Triboar mural.jpg|right|thumb|625px|The mural around the base of the stage in the Triboar playhouse, including Gwaeron on his seat.]]\nGwaeron was believed to rest and sleep just west of [[Triboar]], a bustling town active at all hours and thusly referred to as \"The Town Where Only Gwaeron Sleeps\". There stood a mystical forest known as [[Gwaeron's Slumber]] where many of the trees in were in a perpetual autumnal state, leaves dazzling in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Triboar law forbid any wood-cutting or hunting within the forest to avoid Gwaeron's ire.\n\nMost of his followers visited Gwaeron's Slumber at least once for a holy pilgrimage. Rangers who venerated him or Mielikki often visited those woods for prayer despite the lack of a shrine, or in hopes of receiving inspiration. It was said that worshipers of either who slept in the wood received special dreams, visions and prophecies that hinted towards the goddess's will. Non-rangers among them gained a once-in-a-lifetime, day-long ability to track like a ranger from this effect. Some believed Gwaeron also used dreams, although unbeknownst to them he encounters with him were always unexpected affairs.\n{{quote\n|Gwaeron never appears to those who come seeking him.\n|[[Volo]]\n}}\nLocal militia patrolled Gwaeron's Slumber; less intelligent monsters were never seen there, but creatures like [[orc]]s and trolls were actively prevented from camping there. There was however an [[oni]] that lived in a hillside cave nearby who occasionally visited to feast on unsuspecting rangers as they slept, taking Gwaeron's appearance. The fact that it cleaned up after itself led others to believe that Gwaeron sometimes spirited worthy supplicants away to his true divine domain.",
        "Activities": "Gwaeron was typically seen stalking [[North Faerun|the North]] with Flameheart in hand. He was regularly sighted just outside of Triboar, as well as in the [[High Forest]] and [[Cormanthor]]. He was also known to haunt the [[Evermoors]] searching for trolls to hunt.<ref name=FaP-pp96-97/>\n\nWhen Gwaeron manifested as an animal it was often in order to teach novice rangers about the creature's signs. He would appear as the appropriate creature near inexperienced trackers unfamiliar with the evidence before them, enabling them to correctly connect the two. He would also use birds or herds of herbivores to either reveal clues to his favored or obscure their own trails from foes looking for them.\n\nAnimals aside, Gwaeron manifested as faerie fire to highlight an obscure but useful woodland sign. He manifested in his bare print form to indicate to a devout worshiper who lost a trail how to pick it up again.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Powers and pantheons - Page 68.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Gwaeron Windstrom with [[Shiallia]], [[Siamorphe]], and [[Uthgar]].'']]\nGwaeron, along with his colleagues [[Lurue]] and [[Shiallia]], was allied to and a servant of Mielikki, and thus by extension a servant of [[Silvanus]], In the case of the Master of Tracking, he aided her on some of her missions and taught her rangers how to read forest signs. Despite their positive relations, Gwaeron's small following and the similar tenets of their faith put him at risk of being subsumed as an [[aspect]] of the Forest Queen, even if only by accident.<ref name=FaP-pp96-97/>\n\nGwaeron, in a rare move among the deities of Faerûnian pantheon, had forged alliances with the deities of the [[elven]], [[gnome]], and [[halfling]] pantheons whose portfolios most closely match those of Mielikki, Silvanus, and his own. For example, his demeanor allowed him and [[Fenmarel Mestarine]] to get along well,<ref name=FaP-pp127> better in fact than the [[elf]] god did with most of his fellow [[Seldarine]]. Other bonds included his ties to the elf god [[Solonor Thelandira]], the [[Yondalla's Children|halfling god]] [[Arvoreen]]<ref name=FaP-pp96-97/> and his friendly relationship with the [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnome god]] [[Baervan Wildwanderer]].<ref name=FaP-pp133> He was the natural messenger to send when Mielikki needed a favor from those pantheons.\n\nOther allies of Gwaeron included the traveler god [[Shaundakul]] and the noble beast god [[Nobanion]]. Gwaeron did not just oppose Malar,<ref name=FaP-pp96-97/> but had been relentlessly fighting against his works and Gwaeron was at risk of falling prey to his depredations if not careful.<ref name=FaP-pp96-97/> Aside from Malar, Gwaeron's only other true enemy was [[Vaprak]], the god of the trolls that he so despised.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Gwaeron's teachings mirrored those of his superior Mielikki, which themselves mirrored those of her superior Silvanus, albeit with a greater emphasis on the positive and outreaching aspects of nature.

        },
        "History": "Centuries before the [[Era of Upheaval]], Gwaeron was a mere mortal ranger who roamed North Faerun. His ascension to godhood came through his famous deed: the quick, successful, and successive stalking and slaying of several manifestations and at least one avatar of Malar. For this accomplishment he earned sponsorship to demi-divinity by Mielikki and the undying enmity of Malar.<ref name=FaP-pp96-97 />\n\nGwaeron continued his feud with Malar during the [[Time of Troubles]]. The Beastlord attempted to flee North after his defeat at the claws of Nobanion in Gulthmere Forest, only to be relentlessly hunted down by the Master of Tracking across the region. Nothing Malar could do could shake Gwaeron from his trail, and the accompanying Shiallia followed in their wake, undoing any damage his rampages caused.{{cite web/The Avatar Trilogy: The Gods Walk Toril}}"
