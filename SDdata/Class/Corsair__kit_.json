        "mainbody": "Corsairs were the warriors of the sea in Zakhara.Corsair was a fighter class kit for the Al-Qadim setting.\nCorsairs had no special requirements, but rangers could not become corsairs.\nThese warriors were free spirited and possessed adventurous souls. They prowled the borders of civilized society in search of easy prey or high adventure, sailing wherever their hearts desired. Corsairs often had a bad reputation that was unfounded. Many believed all corsairs to be simple pirates, but there were plenty of good-hearted corsairs sailing the seas surrounding the Land of Fate.\nA wide range of weaponry was available to corsairs, but they rarely wore armor heavier than regular or studded leather.\nMany corsairs were skilled in using two weapons at once.\nCorsairs typically refrained from wearing heavy armor as it presented the danger of drowning while at sea. Many in Zakhara viewed corsairs with disdain, causing the warriors to be looked down upon by other members of society who were aware of their profession.\nCategoryZakharan kits\nCategoryKits\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryFighters (2e)\nCategoryWarrior kits\nCategoryWarriors\nCategoryWarriors (2e)\n3csewqkc9k75mszs82bxaqby5j4xp5e"
