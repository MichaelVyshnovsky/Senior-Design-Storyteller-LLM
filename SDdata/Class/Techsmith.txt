Techsmiths were followers of Gond the Wonderbringer who dedicated themselves to creating new inventions and technical achievements.
Techsmiths received their unique training in the city of Illul in Lantan. Many stayed in Lantan, but others spread across Faer√ªn where they could usually be found within cities. They were usually quite eccentric. They were served by a special golem called a gondsman which was often their closest friend as well.
Given their intimate nature of building constructs, techsmiths also knew plenty of tricks on how to destroy them if needed. They were capable of communicating telepathically with any construct within .
Techsmiths owned a variety of tools useful for working with metals.
