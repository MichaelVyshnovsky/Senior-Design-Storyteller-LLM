'''Techsmiths''' were followers of [[Gond]] the Wonderbringer who dedicated themselves to creating new inventions and technical achievements.

==Culture==
Techsmiths received their unique training in the city of [[Illul]] in [[Lantan]]. Many stayed in Lantan, but others spread across [[Faer√ªn]] where they could usually be found within cities. They were usually quite eccentric. They were served by a special [[golem]] called a [[gondsman]] which was often their closest friend as well.

==Abilities==
Given their intimate nature of building [[construct]]s, techsmiths also knew plenty of tricks on how to destroy them if needed. They were capable of communicating ''[[Telepathy|telepathically]]'' with any construct within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.

==Possessions==
Techsmiths owned a variety of tools useful for working with metals.

==Notable Techsmiths==
* [[Trobriand]], the Metal Mage of [[Undermountain]].
