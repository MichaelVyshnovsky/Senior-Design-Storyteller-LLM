'''Buccaneer''' was a term used to refer to [[rogue]]s who dedicated their lives to piracy and the high seas. When legally sanctioned by a nation to perform their piracy, they were known as '''privateers'''.

==Culture==
The behaviors and attitudes of buccaneers often overlapped with the [[bandit]]s of land, such as desperation, cruelty, fiendish cunning, and a likelihood for internal squabbling.

Sometimes buccaneer ships made alliances and cooperated to raid richly-laden mercantile vessels. Rivalries sometimes developed between buccaneer groups, especially when one carried a wealthy cargo of treasure. They tended to have secret sanctuaries where they would rest, store their provisions and treasure, and plan further acts of piracy.

In [[interior Faerûn]], buccaneers could be found in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], particularly in the [[Pirate Isles]]<ref><ref><ref> but occasionally showing up in [[the Dalelands]]<ref> and the port city of [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/134/Living City: Character Creation Guidelines|27}} In [[south Faerûn]], there were a great deal of [[Dambrath|Dambrai]] [[half-drow]] buccaneers plying the [[Great Sea]].<ref> 

In [[west Faerûn]], buccaneers could be found in much of the [[Trackless Sea]],<ref> with many [[silver elves]] using this way of life to benefit [[Evermeet]]. Buccaneers of the Trackless Sea often made port at the city of [[Skullport]]'s [[Skullport/The Port|Port district]] to take leave from their prolonged stays at sea,<ref> frequenting establishments such as the [[Broken Pike]], [[the Crock and the Helm]], and [[Skin-Deep Tattoos]].<ref>

==Abilities==
Buccaneers eschewed many of the typical skills of thieves in favor of those befitting a sailor, such as navigating, swimming, and general seamanship. They often favored being able to decipher the secret codes that sometimes adorned [[map]]s. And they were particularly known for being adept at climbing and fighting on the [[rope]]s or rigging of ships.

==Possessions==
Buccaneers typically dressed in a manner befitting sailors, eschewing any sort of [[armor]] as they preferred to to be light on their feet and because it would prove troublesome in water. Their choice of weaponry was also typical of sailors, such as [[cutlass]]es.

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], buccaneers of the Pirate Isles were one of the main threats facing the isle of [[Snowdown]].<ref>

In [[1370 DR]], in the month of [[Ches]], a great deal of buccaneer crews in Skullport mutinied or nearly mutinied after not having leave for months.<ref>

==Notable Buccaneers==
* [[Akbet-Khrul]].
* [[Briney Valesaris]], a [[half-elf]] buccaneer.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|193}}
* [[Carreigh Macumail]], captain of the privateer vessel ''[[Mist-Walker]]''.<ref>
* [[Lanyard O' the Sail]].<ref>
