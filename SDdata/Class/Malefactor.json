        "mainbody": "'''Malefactors''' were specialty [[priest]]s devoted to [[Gargauth]], the Tenth Lord of the Nine.",
        "Activities": "Most of Gargauth's faithful kept their allegiance to the Hidden Lord a secret. They worked diligently to increase their personal power, the power of the [[Church of Gargauth]], and Gargauth's power.",
        "Abilities": "These specialty priests could use the following powers on a daily basis depending on their skill level: ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[enthrall]]'', ''[[forget]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[mind fog]]'', and ''[[plane shift]]''. A malefactor could cast ''[[mental domination]]'' three times per tenday, ''[[spiritual corruption]]'' once per tenday, and ''[[exaction]]'' once per month.\n\nA malefactor's skin and skeleton changed as they grew in power and their natural form was corrupted to a fiendish nature due to their allegiance to Gargauth. These changes made it harder for weapons to strike them.",
        "Possessions": "Malefactors were not restricted in the type of [[armor]] they wore or the weapons they wielded. Most were quite skilled at throwing [[dagger]]s."
