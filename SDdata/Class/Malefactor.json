        "mainbody": "alefactors were specialty priests devoted to Gargauth, the Tenth Lord of the Nine.\nMost of Gargauths faithful kept their allegiance to the Hidden Lord a secret. They worked diligently to increase their personal power, the power of the Church of Gargauth, and Gargauths power.\nThese specialty priests could use the following powers on a daily basis depending on their skill level charm person, command, enthrall, forget, charm monster, mind fog, and plane shift. A malefactor could cast mental domination three times per tenday, spiritual corruption once per tenday, and exaction once per month.\nA malefactors skin and skeleton changed as they grew in power and their natural form was corrupted to a fiendish nature due to their allegiance to Gargauth. These changes made it harder for weapons to strike them.\nMalefactors were not restricted in the type of armor they wore or the weapons they wielded. Most were quite skilled at throwing daggers."
