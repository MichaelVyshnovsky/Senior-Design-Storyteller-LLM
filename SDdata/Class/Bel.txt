Bel was an archdevil of the Nine Hells who acted as the Archduke of Avernus until he was supplanted by Zariel.
Unlike many other archdevils, Bel retained a resemblance to a pit fiend,
Calculating and calm in his assessments, Bel was one of the greatest military minds in the Nine Hells, using every tactical advantage available and only engaging in battle on his own terms. His favored tactics involved ambushes, double-crosses, feints and counter-feints, and backstabbing his enemies while anticipating the treacherous moves of his rivals. While he occasionally erupted with anger upon being foiled, he was generally cool-headed—a far cry from the constant, fiery fury of Zariel.
Cunning, analytical and, above all, a realist, Bel was fully aware that demons were infinite in number, if not literally then effectively, and so depended on slow defensive advances to fend them off. He was a long-term logistician, and in his mind the most he could do was contain the endless hordes of the Abyss. Even if victory only lasted a day, he valued the assistance of anyone, mortal or otherwise, and gave fair hearings to those who offered. Though certainly evil and sadistic, his duties came before his amusements.
Almost impossible to surprise, but he was a shrewd negotiator who, as one might expect, kept his promises to the letter and cared less about their spirit. Perhaps Bels only psychological weakness was his disdain for and suspicion of magic, preferring martial rather than magical might.
Bels powers were simply those of a physically and magically enhanced pit fiend. His sheer presence could be so overwhelming that weaker beings of virtue were left paralyzed with terror, while others were struck with awe.
As a general, Bel preferred to fight from afar and never went into battle without minions to command, always using variety when summoning aid. He used cornugons as aerial attackers and seemingly favored summoning gelugons, which he used to deal with the most hard-hitting opposition. 
Bel himself let loose destructive spell-like abilities like walls of fire when in combat, rarely deigning to enter melee himself unless he held some advantage and even then rarely committing to it. before later being said to detest magic, ultimately making him unpredictable in terms of his method of attack.
left|thumb|250px|Bel wielding his infamous blade and wearing a gruesome belt.
Bels personal weapon was his jagged +3 flaming greatsword, a strangely curved blade that radiated heat and was covered in flames. Bels blade was effective against both demons and cold-based creatures. Demons everywhere knew of and feared the weapon, for it was used to slay thousands of their kind over the course of the Blood War. The weapon had also been used to neatly sever the heads of at least a dozen angels, their decapitation not preventing them from screaming while attached to his belt.
Aside from his belt, Bel also wore a highly enchanted ring of protection +5 at all times.
Before becoming Archduke of Avernus, Bel inhabited a fortress likely larger than any on the Prime Material Plane. Constructed from basalt, marble, granite, and iron, and configured with a description-defying sense of infernal logic, Bels keep was incredibly well-fortified. It was surrounded by gigantic mountains, enclosed by a  iron fence with screaming skulls at the top, and featured various thick gates, jagged fences, spiked walls, protruding towers, and sharp angles. Guarding it were hordes of lemures, abishai, barbazu, and other fiends, some of which could perceive invisible objects and individuals, and most of which would gleefully eviscerate intruders. The entire stronghold exuded a feeling of hate, suffering, and wicked delight, and seemed to guarantee harm to anyone that came too close.
After ascending and becoming the Lord of Avernus, Bel ruled its wastes from the impregnable city known as the Bronze Citadel. Formerly a fortress of actual bronze, the original structure merely served as Bels personal quarters where he strategized with the Dark Eight and held meetings with his inner court. The city itself was always in a state of expansion, with work crews of lemures, soul shells, imps, and other slave laborers fortifying it and adding new defenses. The Citadel encompassed an over  territory encircled by fourteen concentric ring walls with barbazus, merregons, and spinagons, housed within the bulwark.
Each ring had several guard towers and a gate guarded by dangerous devils. These rings were outfitted with an unstoppable array of ballistae, catapults, magical relics, and other war machines. It was a utilitarian structure, with half of the wall support being bone scaffolding, and the rear of the unimaginative city was built on the foothills adjoining the Stigamaris Mountains. When captured adventurers came to plead their cases and travelers requested letters of safe passage, they would have to contend with either Bels lieutenants or the Warlord of Avernus himself inside its walls.
After being deposed, Bel made his home in an iron fortress carved out of a volcano. The bastion acted as a forge for Blood War weapons and armor and was protected by infernal legions and dark magic that divined intruders.
Before Bel became archduke, he spent his time as a commander currying favor from his superiors,During 2 edition, the identities of the archdukes were kept secret and had changed from the previous edition. Given recent contradictions regarding the order of Bels and Zariels ascents, Tiamats arguable former station as an archduchess, and Bels own subservience to the Dark Eight,  "superiors" is used in favor of a specific name or group. either by scouring Avernus of demon invaders or taking his legions through planar portals to hunt down tanarri. He was known to sweep across Avernus with his hellish horde in a search for troops to marshal, cutting down anyone foolish enough to stand in their way.
Once he was archduke, however, he spent most of his time simply trying to secure his position and advance the infernal agenda against demonkind by personally supervising defense constructions and planning new military campaigns. He did not become the Lord of Avernus through reckless action or simple luck, He held Avernus tightly considering its size, and kept an eye on events within it through spinagon and imp spies. 
Despite having the influence to reconstruct Avernus, Bel lacked the time, given the constant attention he spent warmongering in his destabilized domain, He also lacked the time to concern himself with diabolical politics, and went out of his way to avoid intrigues with the other Lords of the Nine.
Bel oversaw the production of Blood War arms and armor while scheming to retake his throne after Zariel supplanted him.

Bels bond with his fellow archdevils wasnt particularly strong, owing to the circumstances of his rise to power. He was often referred to as "The Pretender", since his rebellion against his original lord was public knowledge. Of course, they wouldve done the same, but his betrayal killed several of their hidden servants. Neither Mephistopheles, Baalzebul, or their respective faction leaders could look past his blatant treachery, but none cared enough to make a move against him.
Though Asmodeus had mandated that all archdevils were to pay Bel a portion of their soldiers, equipment, and souls for defending Hell, the fact that he kept the Abyss off their collective minds meant they could focus on the far more interesting acts of corruption and subterfuge. In a way, they appreciated his role as their defender and were happy to provide him with resources, so long as their lesser stayed out of their way.
While the forces Bel had at his command could allow him to march against any of the others and succeed to some degree, he showed no desire to try. Some reports claimed this was due to a strange lack of ambition and that Bel was content to lead the forces of Hell forever, while others stated it was because managing the Blood War was so time-consuming he had no opportunity to scheme against the others.
With no allies among his peers, Bel was forced to find them among other beings. In certain infernal courts, Tiamat was mockingly referred to as Bels "scaly watchdog" since she guarded, albeit poorly, the portal between Avernus and Dis, but the relationship between the two was more complex. Despite Tiamat being too prideful to acknowledge allies, the two had reached some sort of agreement, one that increased the number of abishai in Bels armies.
Bel stayed loyal to his master Asmodeus in an attempt to curry his favor for further advancement. The efforts of his spy networks to leak information to the King of Hell, while generally unneeded, were appreciated. In terms of priorities, he was loyal first to Asmodeus, then to the Nine Hells in general, and third to himself.
Bels relationship with Zariel was likely his worst, as the two hated each other with a burning passion. They could barely stand being near one another and both invented distractions to avoid each other, such as Zariel assigning him the busywork of weapons production. Despite Asmodeus decreeing that Zariel was to accept Bel as an advisor, Bel did not try to curb her reckless behavior, instead encouraging it. Believing that Asmodeus now favored Zariel, he tried using indirect tactics to tarnish Zariels reputation, such as trying to compel her to overextend herself and face a humiliating defeat, or otherwise hindering her plans to make her appear inept. If possible, however, the treacherous warlord would prefer Zariels outright removal from the hierarchy of the Nine Hells, even quietly hoping for her redemption.
Bel employed the services of various dukes throughout the Hells, such as Beleth, the Prince of Imps, who would inform the newer archduke what his older and stronger peers were planning. He was also a close ally, or at least a common employer, of Alloces, the Butcher of Nessus. Alloces kept herds of monsters for him (as he did with other archdevils) and Bel frequently made use of Alloces experiments and breeding programs to outfit his armies with new mounts and living weapons.
Various "rabble of devilkin"—powerful outcast devils who lurked in Avernus waiting for a chance to return to power—fought in Bels armies during his reign. One was Moloch, former Grand Duke of Malbolge, who had managed to insinuate himself back into the Hells. While the wolf-headed Amon didnt trust Bel given his past betrayal of his master, Bels loyalty to Asmodeus, and the fact that Bels former master sided with Baalzebul during the Reckoning, meant Bel was spared Amons attempts to avenge his own master, Geryon. Bel gave him covert aid when Amon was working against their shared enemies, and instructed his legions to let him pass through Avernus unharmed, although this support would end if Amons activities threatened him, the Dark Eight, or Asmodeus.
Perhaps Bels most perplexing relationship was with his vassals, the Blood War generals and baatezu administrators known as the Dark Eight. Nominally, the Dark Eight were Bels councilors and reported to him, but in truth, it was the reverse. Although he could theoretically crush all of them, and they had households in his Bronze Citadel, they spent most of their time in Nessus, where Bel lacked any authority. Fortunately for Bel, the Dark Eight remained enthusiastically supportive of his continued reign while he excelled in the Blood War, with their satisfaction warding off rivals and treasonous servants. If Bel were to show any sign of serious weakness, however, their extreme loyalty over the centuries would likely come to an end.
Bel was protected by several pit fiend bodyguards even when not leading his armies. He also surrounded himself with warlike devils, such as cornugons, that led his legions.
Bel was also served by the Erinyes Oreasha, who commanded great authority in the ranks of his armies.Jim Zub (February 2020). “Infernal Tides 4”. Infernal Tides #4 (IDW Publishing) (4)., pp. 2–4.
Bel owed his success in becoming leader of Avernus in part to the assistance of the Sign of One, a Sigilian faction that believed their thoughts influenced the world around them. Their methods worked to some degree, and Bel was secretly sworn to repay them with a favor of equal magnitude when their faction leader requested him to do so.
Zariels already-meager worshiper base scattered upon her defeat and didnt transfer their devotion to Bel, Worse yet, Tiamats ever-present nature in Avernus led to her being mistaken as the true Lord of the First, keeping the Bellic worshiper base small.
While Bel enjoyed cruelty and corruption, he wouldnt actively try to cause the fall of useful mortals in his employ, although as an entity of pure evil, he had a tendency to corrupt them even without conscious effort. Some of the most extreme paladins sworn to an Oath of Conquest went so far in their quest for order that they dealt with the infernal forces of Hell, and many of these "hell knights" were the most ardent supporters of the Warlord of Avernus.
It was important to Bel that those pledged to him succeeded in battle for as long as they lived, Those in Bels service could call upon his power to manifest accursed green flames, which would dance across their weapons and overpower resistance to fire. His brand, the mark of ones service to him, was a cold iron longsword or greatsword that glistened with green hellfire, which was particularly effective against good-aligned beings and even more so against demons.
thumb|left|250px|The avatar of Bel.
Bels avatar was a  muscular humanoid with red-tinged skin whose fearsome scowl and imposing form frightened off most that might bother it. Bels aspects, meanwhile, appeared more like himself, and wielded flaming greatswords. 
Though Bel was normally too busy waging the Blood War to consider the complicated dealings of the Material Plane, he did recognize it—including Faerun—as another one of its battlegrounds. He sent his aspects, typically with devilish followers, to oppose demonic cults of particular importance or power. While this could be seen as a benefit, a devils means of stopping demons could prove, in a different way, equally malevolent. Because of their fiendish methods, aspects of Bel were rarely appreciated more than the demons. However, they werent above partnering with mortals, even if only temporarily, to defeat their targets, and sometimes carried items to entice service from them.
Occasionally, despite his poor reputation, Bel used his aspects as ambassadors and subversives in the courts of other archdevils.
Bels story was one of the greatest inspirational tales in the Nine Hells and every devil wanted to do what he did, kill him, and take his place. Originally a mindless lemure, he climbed the ranks of the diabolical hierarchy, earning his place through strength, skill, and skullduggery until he became a full-fledged pit fiend.
Early in his career, the pit fiend led a response force of a thousand barbazus (around three companies worth) throughout Avernus, quashing rebellions and invasions while receiving accolades with every token tanarri attack thwarted. Eventually he took command of three companies of cornugons under Dispater known as the Iron Guard, but rose to further prominence after masterminding the assassination and replacement of his pit fiend commander and earning more gory glory on the Blood Wars battlefields.
His most famous campaign was likely the legendary political maneuver known as the Four-Cross (or the double double-cross). In an intense battle, Bel suddenly ordered his troops to turn on their baatezu comrades before approaching the wary tanarri with their secret battle plans. He offered to pretend to rejoin the forces of Hell before betraying them on the battlefield yet again, but unbeknownst to the demons, he had secretly leaked their plans and troop sizes to the devils. Afterwards, just as planned, he turned against the baatezu in the middle of the fighting and continued to fight for chaos for over a year before revealing his true masterplan—leading the tanarri into an ambush that would cripple them for over a decade. Beforehand, Bels legions consisted primarily of millions of lemures and nupperibos, as well as a few spinagons, abishai and barbazus, which served as cannon fodder, but he was eventually given control over practically all of Hells armies.
When Bel managed to take the 1 layer of the Hells from his former master, the newly self-titled Lord of Avernus prepared for an assault, only to be met by Martinet, Asmodeuss constable, who claimed the Lord of Nessus was impressed and had decided not to "make him burn in the Pit of Flame for all eternity." So long as Bel kept fulfilling his obligation to the Dark Eight and fought the demonic hordes, he would be allowed control over Avernus he happily accepted.
However, as Bel would soon discover, Asmodeus had ulterior motives behind his support that only became evident after accepting. Knowing that no other Lord of Hell would trust the upstart rebel and that fighting the Blood War was a full-time job, Asmodeus had allowed Bels coup to capitalize on Bels military expertise while preventing him from plotting against other archdevils, and more importantly, himself. It was even said that the Dark Eight (famously loyal to Asmodeus during the Reckoning) had intentionally raised Bel to take the former lords place.
With Bel standing high in his favor, in the , Asmodeus sent Sfena, the daughter of Glasya, to Toril to assassinate the daughter of a storm giant noble named Urdalshone. Urdalshone and a wizard of the surface world had been plotting to attack Avernus, and the assassination presumably would disrupt this for Bels benefit. Although the assassination attempt failed, the overall results of the attack were unknown.
When the fallen angel Zariel fell in 1354 DR after her failed assault against Avernus, Asmodeus was so impressed with her that he rose her up and put her in Bels place. The date 1354 DR coincides with devils occupying Dragonspear Castle, some way north of Elturel, also via portals from Avernus. However, a connection between them, or even which came first, is presently unknown.The story of the Hellriders has changed and evolved significantly in each edition. The 1- and 2-edition campaign settings mention "the story" of a small rescue mission of a single person "in the past" from the perspective of 1356/1357 DR, but Sword Coast Adventurers Guide and Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus expand this into a major campaign only two years before the 1-edition account, which seems contradictory. It may be that the story has grown in the telling over 140 years and that elements have been misremembered or propagandized. Meanwhile, the change from rescue mission to major campaign suggests a case of "mission creep", giving extra cause for the deserters to abandon Zariels crusade. All in all, given its horrific fate, they would seem to be the sensible ones.  Bel managed to return to power for a time, allegedly acting as Zariels loyal vassal until she made one crucial mistake that led to her undoing—she trusted a devil. Older editions positioned Zariel as the original lord of Avernus and the one Bel originally usurped, having guilefully betrayed her millenia ago back during the Reckoning of Hell after spending centuries gaining her trust. The most recent edition, and furthermore its Realmsian sources, are considered to take precedent.
However, Asmodeus eventually claimed that Bels tactics were inadequate in defending Avernus from demonic incursions, reinstating Zariel as its archduke and relegating Bel to a supporting, advisory role. He once again played the part of the obedient servitor, waiting for any opportunity to permanently dispose of the fallen angel.
Bel actively, if subtly and deviously, attempted to sabotage Zariels plans regarding Elturel and the The Companion.
One of the Tale Teeth of Dahlver-Nar, a magical collection of teeth each associated with a different legend, was called the "Daughters of Bel". It was a green steel pit fiend fang that allowed the wielder to summon a pit fiend or, if implanted in the users own mouth, cast dominate monster once per day at the cost of constantly reeking of sulfur.
