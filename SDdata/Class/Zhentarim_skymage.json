        "mainbody": "'''Zhentarim skymages''' were aerial-mounted [[spellcaster]]s that served the [[Black Network]] as spies or arcane enforcers. They were known for the fantastic and exotic beasts upon which they soared through the skies of [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Culture": "Skymages formed strong connections to their respective mounts, earning complete loyalty from their bond. It was possible for these Zhent [[mage]]s to call upon [[dire bat]]s, [[wyvern]]s, [[peryton]]s, [[nightmare]]s, [[sinister]]s, and in the cases of [[necromancer]]s, even the animated remains of a previously deceased mount. The relationships between rider and mount developed the closeness that non-flying mages created with their [[familiar]]s.\n\nContention and feuds were uncommon among the skymages and most disagreements originated from the superiority of various aerial steeds.",
        "Base of Operations": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the skymages maintained a barracks at the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].",
        "Abilities": "As befitting their role in the Zhentarim, skymages were adept riders that could maintain focus on spellcasting even during the most dire of aerial spellbattles. They also developed some skill with basic [[metamagic]].",
        "Possessions": "Skymages were regularly gifted spells [[scroll]]s by their Zhent patrons, to expand their known repertoire of magic.",
        "Relationships": "The skymages of the [[Moonsea]] were often contested by the [[Moonsea skysentinel]]s, the aerial cavalry branch of the paramilitary group the [[Knights of the North]].<ref name=\"CoV-p118>",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Glouris Mristifos]], a skymage that rode [[hippogriff]] transformed into a [[beast of Xvim]].\n* [[Istivin Naerindyth]], the powerful enforcer of the Zhentarim that operated in the [[Dalelands]] region.\n* [[Kurn Cormaeril]], the noble of [[House Cormaeril]] that betrayed his home nation of [[Cormyr]].\n* [[Xabndos]], a rider from [[Tethyamar Fortress]] that rode atop the [[dire bat]] [[Skirrak]]."
