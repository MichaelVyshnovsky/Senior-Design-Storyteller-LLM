Arcane scholar of Candlekeep was a title among the wizards, bards, and sorcerers at the fortress-library of Candlekeep in the late 14 century DR It was also a way of practicing and mastering arcane magic by people who never stepped inside Candlekeep.
Arcane scholars from Candlekeep were known to research archives around Faerûn and collect knowledge on magical theory. Other people practicing the arts of the scholars sometimes became adventurers.
Arcane scholars seldomly explored the practical application of spells because their interests mostly focused on expanding magical theory. These scholars sought to understand the fundamental processes of magic and the inner workings of the Weave. To achieve this goal, these researchers had to often leave Candlekeep and explore other expressions of magic worldwide. This led arcane scholars to spread their traditions and practices. The wizards of Candlekeep were very open to sorcerers and bards joining their ranks because they prized their unique insights into arcane magic.
Blue robes and feathered hats were associated with arcane scholars of Candlekeep.
By achieving a deeper understanding of magic and by discerning its underlying laws, arcane scholars become specialists in metamagic. Arcane scholars started their practice by learning to better concentrate while casting, to identify spells as they were cast, and how to increase the intensity of spells. With time, arcane scholars learned to maximize and quicken their spells with ease, which was not available to other arcane casters.
They were also masters of protecting themselves and others from spells with the use of their considerable knowledge of magic. Arcane scholars have also become especially adept at explaining the workings of magic to ordinary folk. The appraising of magical items, alchemy, diplomacy, and history were often learned by arcane scholars.
Becoming an arcane scholar meant improving previously learned magical arts from one arcane spellcasting tradition only.
The traditions and practices of arcane scholars probably started developing around the 2 century DR, when Candlekeep started to become a sanctuary of knowledge. Scholars began exploring the writings of mages that were found in the keeps dusty libraries. 
Because even the archives of Candlekeep had their limits, arcane scholars started exploring places outside the fortress in search of arcane knowledge and different perspectives on arcane magic. This led to the spread of their traditions around Faerûn.
