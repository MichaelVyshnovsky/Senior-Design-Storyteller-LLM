Heartbloods were members of the clergy of the Cult of Karsus dedicated to Karsus, the Momentary God.
The Cult of Karsus extinguished before any formal titles for the clergys hierarchy could be devised.
Heartbloods wore crimson robes with gold and silver filigree. The only weapons there were permitted to carry were daggers, darts, and staves.
