        "mainbody": "andering swordmages were those practitioners of sword magic who studied enjoyed a wide variety of combat styles and contrasting aspects of the arcane arts.\nThese swordmages gleaned insights from all across the Realms, forming their own unique style that was as varied as their scholarly interests. They were scholars of local folklore, history, and philosophy as much as they were practitioners of battle magic..\nUsing their keen intuition, wandering swordmages were able to bolster the effects of their defensive and offensive aegis spells.\nThey were quick learners and rapidly gained insight into the behaviors and patterns of their foes in battle.\nWandering swordmages developed a number of distinct moves, such as the \"four corners attack\" which slashed at an enemy from different angles.\nUsing their sword, they could create a pair of portals and ensnare an enemy through them to a location of their choosing.\nThe most experienced wandering swordmages could conjure a whirling shield of luminous, magical blades that defended them and their allies."
