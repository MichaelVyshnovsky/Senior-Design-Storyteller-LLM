        "mainbody": "oodscouts were specialty priests of the Church of Mielikki who were similar to rangers.\nWoodscouts often served as guides, as enforcers of Mielikkis doctrines within the forest, and as intermediaries between the forest and the civilized world. They regularly joined adventuring companies to explore, battle threats to the forest, and teach their companions to live in harmony with the wild.\nAll woodscouts were humans, elves, or half-elves. They had a reputation for wisdom and patience and considered themselves learned in the ways of nature and the ways of civilization. They espoused Mielikkis ethos that wilderness and civilization could coexist and tried to live their lives according to it as best they could.\nSimilar to rangers, woodscouts were skilled in combat compared to normal clerics and were adept trackers. Each woodscout had a certain creature as a sworn enemy. Their determination to smite these foes made them more effective when battling them in combat.\nA woodscout could not turn undead and their spells were restricted to the Animal, Combat, Plant, Sun, Weather, and Healing spheres.\nA woodscouts leather or studded leather armor and cloak often made them appear to be common rangers. The cloak could be any color, typically forest green, gray, tan, dark brown, or anything in between. They favored the shortbow and longsword during combat."
