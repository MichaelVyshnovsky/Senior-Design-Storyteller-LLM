        "mainbody": "'''Woodscouts''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Mielikki]] who were similar to [[ranger]]s.<ref name=\"WaPotR-p95\" >",
        "Activities": "Woodscouts often served as guides, as enforcers of [[Mielikki]]'s doctrines within the forest, and as intermediaries between the forest and the civilized world. They regularly joined [[adventuring companies]] to explore, battle threats to the forest, and teach their companions to live in harmony with the wild.",
        "Culture": "All woodscouts were [[human]]s, [[elves]], or [[half-elves]]. They had a reputation for wisdom and patience and considered themselves learned in the ways of nature and the ways of civilization. They espoused Mielikki's ethos that wilderness and civilization could coexist and tried to live their lives according to it as best they could.",
        "Abilities": "Similar to rangers, woodscouts were skilled in combat compared to normal clerics and were adept trackers. Each woodscout had a certain creature as a sworn enemy. Their determination to smite these foes made them more effective when battling them in combat.\n\nA woodscout could not [[turn undead]] and their [[spell]]s were restricted to the [[Animal sphere|Animal]], [[Combat sphere|Combat]], [[Plant sphere|Plant]], [[Sun sphere|Sun]], [[Weather sphere|Weather]], and [[Healing sphere]]s.",
        "Possessions": "A woodscout's [[leather armor|leather]] or [[studded leather]] [[armor]] and [[cloak]] often made them appear to be common rangers. The cloak could be any color, typically forest green, gray, tan, dark brown, or anything in between. They favored the [[shortbow]] and [[longsword]] during combat."
