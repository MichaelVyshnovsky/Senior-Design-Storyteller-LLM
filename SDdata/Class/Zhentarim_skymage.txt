Zhentarim skymages were aerial-mounted spellcasters that served the Black Network as spies or arcane enforcers. They were known for the fantastic and exotic beasts upon which they soared through the skies of Faer√ªn.
Skymages formed strong connections to their respective mounts, earning complete loyalty from their bond. It was possible for these Zhent mages to call upon dire bats, wyverns, perytons, nightmares, sinisters, and in the cases of necromancers, even the animated remains of a previously deceased mount. The relationships between rider and mount developed the closeness that non-flying mages created with their familiars.
Contention and feuds were uncommon among the skymages and most disagreements originated from the superiority of various aerial steeds.
As of the , the skymages maintained a barracks at the Citadel of the Raven in the Dragonspine Mountains.
As befitting their role in the Zhentarim, skymages were adept riders that could maintain focus on spellcasting even during the most dire of aerial spellbattles. They also developed some skill with basic metamagic.
Skymages were regularly gifted spells scrolls by their Zhent patrons, to expand their known repertoire of magic.
