Shadowdancers were those who used innate ability rather than arcane magic to harness the power of shadow magic. The term also referred to monks that followed the Way of Shadow, who were sometimes also called ninjas. Always existing in the place where light and darkness met, shadowdancers were enigmatic and dangerous. Despite the connotations between darkness and evil, many shadowdancers used their abilities for good. Shadowdancers drew upon the power of the shadows to attain stealth techniques that rivaled those of rogues. As they became more experienced, some shadowdancers even learned to command the shadows to do their bidding.
Monks affiliated with the Dark Moon heresy usually trained in the Way of Shadow, following the organizations philosophy that only darkness and loss could bring true wisdom.
Monks of the Way of Shadow learned to harness their ki to cast certain spells, such as darkness, darkvision, minor illusion, pass without trace, and silence.
The affinity with shadows granted shadowdancers the ability to hide from sight, even if closely watched, as long as they were within  of shadows, becoming effectively invisible if in a dimly lit or dark area. They could also travel through the shadows, teleporting from one shadow to another in a way similar to the dimension door spell. As they became more experienced, the distance they could travel grew longer.
Some shadowdancers could create silent, illusory images from shadows. More powerful shadowdancers could in addition call upon a shadow, which behave much like a druids companion, even sharing its summoners worldview. As the shadowdancer became more powerful, the shadow companion likewise became a more potent force.
