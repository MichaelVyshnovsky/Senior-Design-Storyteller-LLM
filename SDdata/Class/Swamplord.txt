Swamplords were specialty priests devoted to Sebek, the Crocodile God within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Swamplords spent most of their time competing with their peers and terrorizing humans who lived near swamps. They were required to slay at least one sentient creature per month and transform one native of Mulhorand per year into a werecrocodile.
Swamplords were always ferocious werecrodiles with robust health.
These individuals could breathe underwater and speak at will with all crocodiles, werecrocodiles, giant crocodiles, and alligators. They could alter self once per day to appear as a floating log. Other magical abilities they could use on a daily basis included crocodile tears, suggestion, sticks to crocodiles, monster summoning VII specifically for a pair of giant crocodiles, power word, stun, and eyebite.
Swamplords wielded a variety of weapons including maces, spears, slings, staff slings, daggers, scimitars, and khopeshes. The heaviest armor they wore, if any given the natural protection of their crocodile skin, was scale mail and they never carried a shield.
