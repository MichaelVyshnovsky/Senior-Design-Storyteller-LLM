'''Swamplords''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Sebek]], the [[Crocodile]] [[God]] within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Activities==
Swamplords spent most of their time competing with their peers and terrorizing [[human]]s who lived near swamps. They were required to slay at least one sentient creature per month and transform one native of [[Mulhorand]] per year into a [[werecrocodile]].

==Culture==
Swamplords were always ferocious werecrodiles with robust health.

==Abilities==
These individuals could breathe underwater and speak at will with all crocodiles, werecrocodiles, [[giant crocodile]]s, and [[alligator]]s. They could ''[[alter self]]'' once per day to appear as a floating log. Other magical abilities they could use on a daily basis included ''[[crocodile tears]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[sticks to crocodiles]]'', ''[[monster summoning VII]]'' specifically for a pair of giant crocodiles, ''[[power word, stun]]'', and ''[[eyebite]]''.

==Possessions==
Swamplords wielded a variety of weapons including [[mace]]s, [[spear]]s, [[sling]]s, [[staff sling]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[scimitar]]s, and [[khopesh]]es. The heaviest [[armor]] they wore, if any given the natural protection of their crocodile skin, was [[scale mail]] and they never carried a [[shield]].
