Rangers were specialty priests devoted to Gwaeron Windstrom, the Master of Tracking.
Some of Gwaerons rangers were selected to join the Fellowship of Stalkers of the Silent Path and enjoyed the use of several new abilities.
All rangers were skilled hunters and trackers. They could cast the natural attunement spell several times per day depending on their skill level. They could also wind walk once per day.
Rangers could use any weapon and wear any armor, though most preferred to avoid anything heavier than studded leather.
