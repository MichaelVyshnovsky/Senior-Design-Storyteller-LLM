        "mainbody": "'''Vuddor''' (singular '''vuddar''') were the specialty [[priest]]s of [[Thard Harr]], the patron of the [[Wild dwarf|wild dwarves]].",
        "Etymology": "The word ''vuddar'' means \"of the jungle\" in the [[Dwarvish#Authalan|Authalan]] dialect.",
        "Reputation": "The vuddor were held in high esteem by [[Wild dwarf|''dur Authalar'']], who considered Thard Harr to be the only dwarven god.",
        "Organization": "While the vast majority of vuddor were wild dwarves, Thard Harr's clergy did in fact include members of other dwarven subraces as members as well.\n\nAbout half of Thard Harr's clergy were vuddor. By [[1370 DR]] about 40% of the vuddor were male, a much higher percentage than in other dwarven clerical orders.",
        "Titles": "Like all priests of Thard Harr, upon initiation into the order, a vuddar would be granted a special title from his or her god through a dream in the middle of the night. This title was usually the name of a great jungle beast.",
        "Activities": "Along with the regular [[cleric]]s (called \"shamans\") of Thard Harr, the vuddor led their fellow dwarves on hunts or into war and also served as the spokespeople for their tribes.\n\nThey always prayed for their spells in the mornings.",
        "Abilities": "While the shamans of Thard Harr could turn [[undead]], members of the vuddor did not. Vuddor were granted spells from the [[All sphere|all]], [[Animal sphere|animal]], [[Combat sphere|combat]], [[Elemental sphere|elemental]], [[Guardian sphere|guardian]], [[Healing sphere|healing]], [[Plant sphere|plant]], [[Protection sphere|protection]], or [[Weather sphere|weather]] [[sphere]]s, with some additional spells from the [[Chaos sphere|chaos]], [[Charm sphere|charm]], [[Creation sphere|creation]], [[Divination sphere|divination]], [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]], [[Sun sphere|sun]], and [[Travelers sphere|travelers]] spheres.\n\nA vuddar was an expert in animal lore and survival skills. Vuddor could read and write in [[Dethek]] runes, unlike most wild dwarves. They sometimes also learned the ways of [[ranger]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Like all clergy of Thard Harr, the vuddor armored themselves in oil and dried mud. They wore animal skulls as helmets and never cut their hair or beards.\n\nRather than carry a holy symbol, the vuddor wore Thard Harr's icon as a tattoo on their forearms."
