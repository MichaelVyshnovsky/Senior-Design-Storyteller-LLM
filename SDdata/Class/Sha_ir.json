        "mainbody": "Shairs were unique Zakharan wizards who communicated with the spirits of the elements&mdashthe genies. In fact, some genies forced to deal with mankind would only interact with a shair.Shair was a wizard class kit for the Al-Qadim setting, and later adapted into a base class for v.3.5. Some Zakharans even believed traces of genie blood were spread across all races populating the Land of Fate and that this genie ancestry manifested itself the most within a shair.\nShairs had no special requirements, though it took a certain level of bravery and confidence to willingly deal with genies. Even members of races normally forbidden or unable to practice magic could become shairs. Races with a degree of innate resistance to magic, such as dwarves and drow, would have their fetched spells fail some of the time. This chance of spell failure was directly linked to the degree of magic resistance inherent in the shair.\nThese wizards were mysterious and powerful figures in Zakhara.\nMany genies who were forced to work with mortals would not cooperate unless working directly with a shair.\nFemale shairs were sometimes called shaira.\nShairs often only carried a staff or dagger, and they never wore armor, though they did use magical items that protected them from harm as other wizards did.\nShairs could not memorize spells, which was the norm for most wizards instead, they acquired all of their magic and enchantments through genies. Nor could these wizards create magical items or use spells in the conventional manner like other magic-users. They did not even have their own spellbooks.\nEven so, they had an awesome variety of magical powers, each revolving around genies, as explained below.\nShairs were able to summon a small elemental familiar called a gen. Gen could be summoned from each of the four elemental planes. No matter which plane the gen came from, it happily became the shairs servant and worked in all of the elemental planes to find magic for its master, including planes opposed to its native element. Most gen were fanatically loyal to their shair.\nThe ritual required to summon and bind a gen lasted many hours. A shair could spend time fasting and communing with the nature of the elemental plane from which the gen would emerge to ensure success. A shair could not be interrupted during this time or the ritual would fail.\nA shair could hear and see whatever their gen experienced. The two could also communicate at will with each other through a mental link. Though useful in the right situation, this mental link had a short range.\nthumb|right|250px|A shair and genâ€”a match made in heaven, or hell, depending on your perspective.\nOnce summoned, gen were able to find information for the shair by accessing a special network used by all genie-kind, allowing the gen to retrieve spells for their master. Once a shair stated the specific spell they required, the gen would travel to the appropriate plane and fetch it for their master.\nIn order to request a spell, a shair needed to know of the spells existence. Basic spells were considered common knowledge, but the shair needed to have actually seen more advanced spells cast in order to request them. Shairs could even request the strange spells cast by ajamis, or outland wizards. In rare instances, shairs were even known to request priest or cleric spells.\nGen required time to find a requested spell, and stronger spells took longer to find than weaker ones. Extremely powerful spells sometimes caught the attention of gods or god-like beings. Once a gen was sent off to find a spell, it was not guaranteed that they would return safely.\nOnce a spell was requested, the shair could not cancel the request or recall the gen. They were forced to wait for the gen to return with or without the requested spell. When a gen returned with a spell, the shair could only cast it once before the knowledge was lost. Also, shairs could not send their gen to retrieve another spell until their current spell was used or expired, preventing them from hoarding magic. Shairs still needed material components for applicable spells. All verbal and somatic components were imparted telepathically between the gen and their master.\nEspecially brave shairs could send their gen off in search of clerical or priest spells.\nConsequences of divine retribution could include\n* suffering a case of the evil eye,\n* having the hand of Fate turned against the shair,\n* dealing with a messenger sent by the offended god to teach the shair a lesson, or\n* being transported to face the offended god directly on their home plane.\nThrough their constant exposure to genies and genie-kind, shairs eventually gained the ability to recognize items that were crafted by genies, spells cast by genies, or even spells provided for other shairs by their gen. Shairs could also detect invisible genies and genies masquerading under an illusion or polymorph ability.\nOnce per day a shair could call upon a janni for assistance. Though they were lesser genies, jann could provide valuable aid to the shair and were readily available in Zakhara. To call a janni, the shair would yell out loudly to grab their attention. The call of more powerful shairs ranged farther than weaker shairs. If a janni was within range of the call they would come to the shairs aid.\nJann called in this manner offered their assistance freely. They were not charmed or under any compulsion to help the shair. Thus, if a shair, or his or her companions, showed hostility toward the janni, it would abandon them. Shairs who deliberately attacked a called janni lost the ability to call future jann unless some kind of restitution was made.\nJann who aided shairs sometimes sought the shair at a later time, seeking assistance in some manner or another. If the shair refused to aid the janni, then the shairs reputation in the eyes of all jann was greatly diminished. Likewise, if they shair went out of their way to assist the janni then their reputation was boosted.\nDue to their close relationships with genies, who were elemental creatures, shairs gained protection from all elements. Spells or attacks from the elements did not harm them as much, and they were able to resist their effects more. These abilities were increased for the shair when dealing with the element of his or her gens native plane.\nAdditionally, shairs were able to survive on any of the elemental planes without additional protection for a period of time based on the power of the shair.\nthumb|left|250px|A genie answers.\nOnce a shair gained a moderate amount of power they were able to call upon true genies&mdashdjinn, dao, efreet, or marids. Most shairs typically called a genie native to the same elemental plane as their gen. This power could only be used once per week.\nSuccessfully calling a genie did not mean that the arriving genie was friendly. Genies who were attacked by anything upon their arrival instantly lashed out at their attacker and the shair, regardless of whether or not the shair had anything to do with the attack in the first place. A genie would not perform services for the shair unless it was bribed, threatened, or otherwise convinced to help. Genies aligned with the same elemental plane as a shairs gen were more likely to offer their services. The opposite was true for shairs whose gen were from a different elemental plane than that of the genie.\nGenie services included manual labor, transportation, protection, or using the genies inherent abilities. Wishes could also be granted but only if the genie was able to figure out a way to twist them to its own advantage.\nShairs who called upon genies too often had a greater chance of randomly being visited by genies who tasked them with a small quest. Refusing these quests harmed the shairs reputation within the genie circles. If a shair refused enough genies in this manner, then that specific type of genie would refuse to answer calls for a full year.\nPart of the reason for a genies existence was servitude to mortals or greater beings. This was one aspect of genie culture that shairs were able to take practical advantage of by entering into contracts with the elemental creatures. Shairs were able to increase their standing in the entire genie community if they had a bound genie serving them. Genies entered into such contracts willingly they were not slaves to the shair, though they were under obligation to remain with their new master for the duration of the contract and perform all of the shairs orders. Such contracts were considered carefully by a genie before it agreed to the terms of service. Shairs were able to bind dao, djinn, efreet, and marids.\nTo bind a genie, the shair first needed to call the genie in the regular manner. At this point the shair and genie would discuss the terms of service. Genies were free to add or remove details from the contract. Any number of factors could influence the genies willingness to accept the contract, including\n* the shairs natural charisma,\n* how powerful or weak the genie considered the shair to be,\n* whether or not the shair had bound previous genies, (shairs were more likely to bind genies if they had bound genies in the past,)\n* the shairs acceptance or denial of the genies specific contract demands, or\n* if the shair ever used a genie prison.\nthumb|right|250px|A genie considers serving a shair.\nOnce the genie agreed to the contract, he or she became the shairs bound servant for 101 days.\nCommon contract demands from genies included\n* the shair would immediately release the genie from servitude if any other contract demand was broken\n* the shair agreed to disdain from asking for wishes\n* the shair agreed never to use a genie prison on the genie\n* the shair provided for the genie a lifestlye to which it was accustomed\n* the shair allowed the genie a one day break every ten days\n* the shair shared treasure with the genie, (sharing large amounts of treasure with genies was an easy way to make bound genies happy and eager to serve)\n* the genie would be allowed to flee (and return later) if it was critically injured during combat or\n* the genie would be free from the contract upon the shairs death.\nGenies who loathed serving shairs were known to make outlandish requests in the hope that the shair would utterly reject them.\nGenies under contract with a shair heeded their commands, but commands conflicting with the genies nature could carry unwanted results. For example, if a shair requested that a good-natured genie steal an item, the genie might perform the task and return with the item, but it would leave a letter with the victim of the theft explaining where the shair might be found. The same guideline applied for evil-natured genies asked to perform an act of kindness.\nA shair who allowed their bound genie to die while under contract could not call or bind another genie for 100 days. The next attempts to bind genies of the same kind that died were much more difficult.\nthumb|right|250px|A shair traps a terrified genie.\nThis bold ability allowed the shair to craft a specialized cell designed to ensnare a genie against its will. Genie prisons were used sparingly or in extreme situations when a shair needed to remove a genie hindering their goals.\nAfter years of developing their craft, shairs could cross the Ethereal Plane and traverse any of the elemental planes they wished. When traveling in this manner, a shair could spend many days upon an elemental plane.\nShairs could even bring other travelers, both willing and unwilling, along with them during their inter-planar travels. Any traveler brought in this manner gained the same elemental immunity that the shair enjoyed. Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the shair would reappear in the same spot from which he or she had departed. If that spot was occupied, he or she would appear close by.\nTruly powerful shairs were received by genie lords. This could occur only once per calendar month.\nIn order to do this, the shair needed to travel to the appropriate plane of existence for the type of genie lord desired to be contacted. Only one type of elemental genie could be contacted at a time. Several days would pass before the shair was greeted by a procession of genie-kind, who would accompany the shair to the genie lord.\nShairs could also designate someone to take their place in requesting an audience. The petitioner needed to wait for several days in a remote area such as the deep desert. He or she would then be greeted by the same procession of genies.\nThe procession that greeted the shair was comprised of noble genies, jann, and regular genies. They would not appear at the site of a battle. If the procession was attacked in any way, they would seek to destroy the attackers and then vanish without greeting the shair.\nShairs who were granted an audience were able to get advice from noble genies who possessed truly vast intelligence and wisdom regarding a wide array of topics. Shairs could even report the crimes of lesser genies who were then immediately summoned and dealt with by the noble genie.\nIn turn, shairs were also judged for any wrongdoings committed against genie-kind and punished accordingly.\nAs a shairs powers grew, their gen also gained power as well as more confidence. The gen also enjoyed a boost to their general health and hardiness.\nGenies devised the rituals that would enhance the shairs gen, so it was not uncommon for a shair to curry favor with a genie by completing special tasks or quests beforehand.\nThe actual power ritual was quite rigorous for the shair, prompting many to enhance their fortitude with a ritual strength spell beforehand so they were able to forego sustenance and the need for sleep. Any interruption in the ritual risked disaster.\nThe first shair was Jafar the Incomparable, creator of an artifact known as the Seal.\nA secretive society of some 70 shairs, called the Hands of Badiat abd Alai, was spread throughout the Land of Fate. The Hands served the various genie races, improving their relationship with the enlightened races of Zakhara. The genies often granted enhancements to the shairs already impressive magical powers in exchange for their services.\nListed below are shairs who traveled the Land of Fate\n* Aasim\n* Alai ibn-Hasim\n* Jadd Alai\n* Sudai Calin\n* Al-Fatat\n* Mara al-Gurab Sakir\n* Safia al-Gurab Sakir\n* Hadra bint Aswiyah\n* Akura al-Hiyali\n* Inayah bint Inam\n* Essafah al-Jamila\n* Akim al-Kalaas\n* Tamood al-Kasif\n* Khadiga\n* Khalil\n* Anwar al-Makruh\n* Kerim Najar\n* Nikolai Nikopolis\n* Othmar bin Jaqal\n* Othmar bin Kaloth\n* Qohadar\n* Adnan al-Raqi\n* Tamr na-Fia\n* Jafar al-Samal\n* Wadia bint Sali\n* Wudeia bint Samia\n* Alim Zangi"
