Anchors were specialty priests of the Church of Umberlee who guided ships at sea or aided those in danger, for a fee of course.
Anchors raised funds for the church by charging fees for guiding ships through treacherous waters and even saving people from drowning. Thirty percent of their earnings was donated to the church.
They served a role similar to a lifeguard who was also a mercenary.
Anchors could speak with animals at will for all marine life. They could turn marine undead as well. Anchors could not cast spells related to fire or earth.
While at sea anchors usually wore blue clothing suited for swimming. They never wore armor as it caused them to sink in water. Their land attire consisted of a blue-green body stocking with a white cloak for warmth. Especially distinguished anchors also wore a rare tiara made from black coral. Anchors favored tridents, harpoons, and daggers as weapons.
