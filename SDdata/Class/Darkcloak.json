        "mainbody": "'''Darkcloaks''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Shar]] who served as oracles and care-givers to those in emotional distress.<ref name=\"WaPotR-p103\" >",
        "Activities": "These individuals brought blessed forgetfulness and bliss to those with severe emotional issues.",
        "Culture": "Darkcloaks were an oddity among [[Shar]]'s clergy in that they actually provided beneficial services to others. Their activities helped Shar's faith gain a socially acceptable view among the general public.",
        "Abilities": "Darkcloaks could see well in the dark with ''[[infravision]]'' that extended to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. They could cast the ''[[forget]]'' spell several times per day depending on their skill. Though they spoke in riddles, a darkcloak's ''[[augury]]'' was always successful. They could provide one person with a glimpse of the future once per day. With a willing subject, a darkcloak could utter a soothing word that removed a single terrible memory from the subject's mind. This could be done once per day.\n\nDarkcloaks did not spend much time honing their martial skills and were often quite clumsy in combat. They fought even worse in sunlight or under a full moon. They were unable to use [[spell]]s from the [[combat sphere]], and could only use the reverse forms of any spells from the [[light sphere]].",
        "Possessions": "As their name implied, darkcloaks wore long black [[cloak]]s trimmed with purple. The rest of their attire was often black. They wore a strange [[perfume]] that many swore possessed amnesia-inducing properties, but the Church of Shar refused to comment on the matter.",
        "History": "Darkcloaks were found in the village of [[Reithwin]], before its ruination in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
