        "mainbody": "arkcloaks were specialty priests of the Church of Shar who served as oracles and care-givers to those in emotional distress.\nThese individuals brought blessed forgetfulness and bliss to those with severe emotional issues.\nDarkcloaks were an oddity among Shars clergy in that they actually provided beneficial services to others. Their activities helped Shars faith gain a socially acceptable view among the general public.\nDarkcloaks could see well in the dark with infravision that extended to . They could cast the forget spell several times per day depending on their skill. Though they spoke in riddles, a darkcloaks augury was always successful. They could provide one person with a glimpse of the future once per day. With a willing subject, a darkcloak could utter a soothing word that removed a single terrible memory from the subjects mind. This could be done once per day.\nDarkcloaks did not spend much time honing their martial skills and were often quite clumsy in combat. They fought even worse in sunlight or under a full moon. They were unable to use spells from the combat sphere, and could only use the reverse forms of any spells from the light sphere.\nAs their name implied, darkcloaks wore long black cloaks trimmed with purple. The rest of their attire was often black. They wore a strange perfume that many swore possessed amnesia-inducing properties, but the Church of Shar refused to comment on the matter.\nDarkcloaks were found in the village of Reithwin, before its ruination in the late 14 century DR."
