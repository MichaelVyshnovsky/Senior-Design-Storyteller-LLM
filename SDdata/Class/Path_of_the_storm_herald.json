        "mainbody": "he path of the storm herald was a primal path taken by barbarians who chose to channel the primal magic of nature into their bodies during a rage. Individual barbarians that took this path in life were known as storm heralds.\nWhile in their rage, a storm herald became a tempest of natural magic, which swirled around their body in a dramatic display.\nThey were among the highest-regarded barbarians of their given tribes. They often trained in understanding and harnessing primal magic alongside rangers and druids.\nSome among their ranks chose to dwell in the harshest and most remote locations, such as isolated glaciers, barren deserts, and storm-wracked coastal lands.\nEarly during their training, storm heralds learned to create an aura around their body that resembled a magical tempest. This aura behaved differently depending on the habitat with which the barbarian most closely identified. Heralds of the deserts conjured blistering heat, while those who harnessed the power of icy tundra solicited ice spirits to their aid.\nAs a barbarians very soul became closer in tune with nature, they acquired inner strength and resilience to the elements.\nThe most powerful storm heralds could harness their storm auras to the greatest effect. They could extend their own elemental resilience to others and even turn their auras on their foes. Heralds of the sea could use their aura to knock down enemies as if struck by a wave, while those from the cold lands could freeze them where they stood."
