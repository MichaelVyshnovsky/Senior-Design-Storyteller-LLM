Smugglers were a variety of rogue that specialized in the trafficking of goods (and sometimes people) into areas where they were considered illegal to avoid seizure, or legal goods in order to avoid tariffs, a role that was vital to many black markets and criminal underworlds.
Smugglers would sneak into locations, such as by going on foot or through port under the cover of night, entering the waters by means of a canoe or rowboat. Alternatively, smugglers would have hidden compartments and false doors within their boats or wagons for the purpose of hiding their illicit goods.
When traveling through dangerous areas rife with bandits and monsters a freelance smuggler might hire the service of some thugs or mercenaries to protect them, otherwise they would have to resort to paying their harassers off with a cut of their merchandise in return for their safety. Though this never guaranteed their safety, as there was always a chance of being double-crossed. Because of this many smugglers were part of thieves guilds, the Hillsfar Rogues Guild, which they could rely upon for muscle. Some charismatic smugglers even specialized in dealing diplomatically with other guilds. Smugglers also benefitted from the safehouses and secret routes that thieves guilds had within their respective cities.
Smugglers largely operated through fences. They rarely, if ever, sold their goods directly. or fences themselves.
