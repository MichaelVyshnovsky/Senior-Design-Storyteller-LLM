        "mainbody": "Hunters were warriors who represented the closest thing to soldiers among the peaceful Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin.\nAll hunters proved themselves through their skill with weapons, earning the honor to provide meat for their community. Hunters were the first, and sometimes only, line of defense against any attack from both monsters or Nahopaca raiders.\nIn order to honor the spirits of their slain prey, a hunter would always leave choice organs from the kill behind for the spirit to reclaim. Fraternities of hunters observed ceremonial rituals together. Hunters held a prestigious position among the Azuposi. They were forbidden from ever bragging about their exploits.\nHunters were skilled in tracking and a variety of survival tactics.\nAll hunters carried either a short bow or sling. Most of the gear needed for a hunt was included in a leather sack strapped to their back."
