A mythic sovereign was a monarch who was destined for true greatness. Their exemplary deeds and heroic feats were often the stuff of legends, shared for centuries after their reign.
These individuals could arise from any kingdom or realm across Faer√ªn. Champions of justice and tyrannical despots were both equally capable of earning the designation of mythic sovereign.
Mythic sovereigns were capable of heroic feats of inspiration to their subjects in battle, granting them a sense of ardent fervor.
If they were felled in combat, some of their ranks could entirely disregard their wounds and stand their ground.
* Azoun Obarskyr IV, the fabled king of Cormyr
* Gareth Dragonsbane, the paladin of Ilmater who united the realms of Damara and Vaasa
* Tchazzar, the red dragon who ruled over Chessenta
* Yamun Khahan, the leader of the Grand Army of the Tuigan and foe of Azoun Obarskyr IV.
