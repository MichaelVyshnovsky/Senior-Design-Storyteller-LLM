Their spirit could cast several spells selected by the spiritlord on their behalf. Having their spirit mask in close proximity made it more difficult for the spiritlord to be surprised.\nTabaxi shamans wielded clubs, spears, kerries, and yklwas. They usually wore dinosaur hide armor and carried a hlang."
