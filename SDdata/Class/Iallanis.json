        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Iallanis sometimes sent omens to her faithful in the form of pleasant scents (often floral) tinkling sounds (often tinkling winds), rare flowers, and similarly gentle signs."
        },
        "Personality": "Iallanis was an advocate for beauty, mercy, and love, hating no part of her father's creation and never turning away a good-natured or formerly [[evil]] but repented giant.{{Cite dragon/342/Spellcraft: Alien Blessings|75-76}}",
        "Powers": "Iallanis's avatar was a potent druid immune to [[poison]] and disease-causing spells and those that [[energy drain|drained energy]] and induced blindness, as well as [[inflict wounds|cause wounds]] or [[harm]] spells. She could [[charm person|charm people]] (including giants) at will, which was twice as effective against the giants. She could also cast [[remove curse]] on any mortal thrice a day.",
        "Realm": "Iallanis's realm of [[Florallium]] was a place of quiet gardens and crystal springs, located in either the 1{{st}} layer of [[Arborea]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] or [[Jotunheim]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]]. It was tacitly acknowledged as neutral territory for the residents of Jothunheim, god or [[petitioner]], where peace could be negotiated in times of war and celebrations could be had during times of peace.",
        "Activities": "Iallanis often sent an avatar to celebrate important events of joy and delight alongside giantkind. These included the wedding of a leader, the consecration of a magnificent temple or other building, the completion of a grand work of art, or the ending of a war.Â She always sought to harmoniously reunite the disparate giant races, her ultimate goal being to bring together all the [[Jotunbrud]] and reestablish [[Ostoria]] as a kingdom of not only ambition, but benevolence and learning.",
        "Relationships": "Like [[Memnor]], Iallanis was a \"singleton\" deity, a child of [[Annam]] not part of a larger grouping like her siblings [[Stronmaus]] and [[Hiatea]], [[Surtur]], [[Thrym]], and [[Skoraeus]], or [[Grolantor]] and [[Karontor]].\n\nDespite their conflicts with the giant gods in the past, the [[Seldarine]] refrained from driving her out of Arborea, although they lacked much respect for her. She had a close friendship with the [[swanmay]] goddess [[Fionnghuala]] for reasons unknown.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Priests of Iallanis were tasked with creating things of beauty (including things like artistry, crafts, and gardens), keeping the Jotunbrud united, dispensing mercy and absolution to all in need, working with all other good creatures, and striving to bring all giantkind itself into the fold of goodness. Only the honor of the gods was to be placed before that of mercy and only mercy's honor outweighing that of beauty. No deed, good or bad, was to go unrewarded or unpunished respectively. They believed that from life arose passion and from strength came kindness.",
            "Rituals": "Priests of Iallanis always prayed over any meal or gift they were given. Even when the priests of other deities were involved or the giants in question were of the evil alignment, they also conducted nearly all marriages between two Jotunbrud members. On every first day of spring, all of them assembled in a giant steading for a grand celebration. A marriage would be performed at the party's height whenever possible, an honor so great that the most important members of Jotunbrud society would wait until the spring to wed.",
            "Clothing": "Priests of Iallanis could not keep any worldly possessions beyond those needed to maintain their own humble lives. They could wear [[leather armor]] and were allowed to wield [[quarterstaff]]s, [[net]]s, [[mancatcher]]s, and [[bow]]s."
        },
        "History": "Iallanis was introduced to giantkind and its struggles while still an adolescent, assuming her spot in the Ordning shortly after. In mythology her birth followed Annam's acceptance of his eldest daughter and her own sister, Hiatea, and the All-Father's subsequent willingness to allow himself female offspring.\n\nAt some point in history, [[Corellon]] led the Seldarine from [[Ysgard]] to Arborea to claim the land from the giants. The giants lost the war against the glory-seeking elven gods and were driven out before [[Arvandor]] was founded. Unlike her brothers, Iallanis did not fight the invaders but stayed at home and so was allowed to stay.\n\nWhen shamanic giants of Memnor developed dragon dowsing rods to kill and enslave [[metallic dragon|metallic]] [[wyrmling]]s, a coalition of priests of Stronmaus, Hiatea, and Iallanis stole the formula to counteract their activities, rescuing the dragons and turning them over to the [[Talons of Justice]].",
        "Trivia": "Ialllanis featured in one of the images of Annam's mythical [[axe]], [[Sky Cleaver]], where she joined the hands with Memnor and Karontor in brotherly love.<ref>"
