        "mainbody": "Iallanis ( tall and at others towering at . She wore a short, bright, green dress from which living flowers grew. As was typical for many goddesses of love, one could recognize her avatar as such by the fact that it was always bare legged and bare footed.\nIallanis sometimes sent omens to her faithful in the form of pleasant scents (often floral) tinkling sounds (often tinkling winds), rare flowers, and similarly gentle signs.\nIallanis was an advocate for beauty, mercy, and love, hating no part of her fathers creation and never turning away a good-natured or formerly evil but repented giant.\nIallaniss avatar was a potent druid immune to poison and disease-causing spells and those that drained energy and induced blindness, as well as cause wounds or harm spells. She could charm people (including giants) at will, which was twice as effective against the giants. She could also cast remove curse on any mortal thrice a day.\nIallaniss realm of Florallium was a place of quiet gardens and crystal springs, located in either the 1 layer of Arborea in the Great Wheel cosmology or Jotunheim in the World Tree cosmology. It was tacitly acknowledged as neutral territory for the residents of Jothunheim, god or petitioner, where peace could be negotiated in times of war and celebrations could be had during times of peace.\nIallanis often sent an avatar to celebrate important events of joy and delight alongside giantkind. These included the wedding of a leader, the consecration of a magnificent temple or other building, the completion of a grand work of art, or the ending of a war.Â She always sought to harmoniously reunite the disparate giant races, her ultimate goal being to bring together all the Jotunbrud and reestablish Ostoria as a kingdom of not only ambition, but benevolence and learning.\nLike Memnor, Iallanis was a \"singleton\" deity, a child of Annam not part of a larger grouping like her siblings Stronmaus and Hiatea, Surtur, Thrym, and Skoraeus, or Grolantor and Karontor.\nDespite their conflicts with the giant gods in the past, the Seldarine refrained from driving her out of Arborea, although they lacked much respect for her. She had a close friendship with the swanmay goddess Fionnghuala for reasons unknown. \nIallanis had taken over some of Annams role as the god of fertility, with a usually small but growing cult across many worlds.\nIallanis turned down no good creature from her priesthood. She accepted any true giant on equal terms and would include giant-kin among them if not for Annam and Stronmaus forbidding the policy as an Ordning violation, forcing her to limit the power giant-kin followers could receive. Ironically this meant that her giant-kin followers could not advance as far as ordinary mortals, who themselves could not reach the heights of power under her than true giants could. Notably storm giants could achieve even higher power than all those previously mentioned. In any case, only a priest or shaman who was happily married could advance very far.\nIallanis offered the power to charm people (including giants) to her lower level priests, charm monster to intermediates, and symbol of persuasion to the most powerful, each once per day. Priests were capable of turning undead, though were not particularly adept relative to their overall power. Iallanis also offered a unique spell known as throwing arm of Iallanis making it easier to hurl stones at ones enemy, though creatures below  in height could not benefit from it.\nPriests of Iallanis were tasked with creating things of beauty (including things like artistry, crafts, and gardens), keeping the Jotunbrud united, dispensing mercy and absolution to all in need, working with all other good creatures, and striving to bring all giantkind itself into the fold of goodness. Only the honor of the gods was to be placed before that of mercy and only mercys honor outweighing that of beauty. No deed, good or bad, was to go unrewarded or unpunished respectively. They believed that from life arose passion and from strength came kindness. \nPriests of Iallanis always prayed over any meal or gift they were given. Even when the priests of other deities were involved or the giants in question were of the evil alignment, they also conducted nearly all marriages between two Jotunbrud members. On every first day of spring, all of them assembled in a giant steading for a grand celebration. A marriage would be performed at the partys height whenever possible, an honor so great that the most important members of Jotunbrud society would wait until the spring to wed.\nPriests of Iallanis could not keep any worldly possessions beyond those needed to maintain their own humble lives. They could wear leather armor and were allowed to wield quarterstaffs, nets, mancatchers, and bows.\nIallanis was introduced to giantkind and its struggles while still an adolescent, assuming her spot in the Ordning shortly after. In mythology her birth followed Annams acceptance of his eldest daughter and her own sister, Hiatea, and the All-Fathers subsequent willingness to allow himself female offspring.\nAt some point in history, Corellon led the Seldarine from Ysgard to Arborea to claim the land from the giants. The giants lost the war against the glory-seeking elven gods and were driven out before Arvandor was founded. Unlike her brothers, Iallanis did not fight the invaders but stayed at home and so was allowed to stay.\nWhen shamanic giants of Memnor developed dragon dowsing rods to kill and enslave metallic wyrmlings, a coalition of priests of Stronmaus, Hiatea, and Iallanis stole the formula to counteract their activities, rescuing the dragons and turning them over to the Talons of Justice.\nIalllanis featured in one of the images of Annams mythical axe, Sky Cleaver, where she joined the hands with Memnor and Karontor in brotherly love."
