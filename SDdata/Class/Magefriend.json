        "mainbody": "A magefriend was a specialty priest of the Church of Azuth who was dedicated to counseling wizards and spellcasters.\nA magefriends role was similar to that of Azuth counseling Mystra. Most of these individuals preferred to wander Faer√ªn as opposed to being cloistered in a house of worship.\nMagefriends were serious individuals who believed magic needed to be wielded rationally.\nIn addition to their divine magic, magefriends could cast arcane magic spells similar to a wizard with half of their skill. They could even choose to be specialist wizards. Gnome magefriends were always illusionists. Magefriends gained their arcane spells not through studying spellbooks, but through prayer.\nThese priests could not turn undead, nor could they cast any divine spells from the animal sphere, plant sphere, or weather sphere.\nMagefriends wore long robes of shimmering gray with a light blue cloak and hood. They often appeared to be wizards. Magefriends never wore armor and wielded a staff in combat.\nMagefriends maintained strong relationships with worshipers of Mystra."
