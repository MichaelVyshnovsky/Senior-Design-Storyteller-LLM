They were well-versed in the laws and customs of their place of birth and wherever they lived.\nIn addition to their normal spells, holy justices could cast hold person, strength of one, memory read, legal thoughts, and holy word on a daily basis. They could detect lies and see invisibility at will and impose impeding permission once per tenday. The effects of any spell from the law sphere cast by a holy justice were particularly difficult to resist. They practiced their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat, similar to warriors.\nIn addition to bludgeoning weapons, holy justices often wielded longswords or bastard swords. They did not have restrictions on the type of armor they were permitted to wear."
