'''Maquar crusaders''' were a noble class of warriors in the service of the [[rajah]] of [[Estagund]]. They were unwaveringly loyal champions that lived modest lives in service to their ruler. They were especially renowned for their skill with a [[falchion]].

==Activities==
The Maquar's primary responsibility was to serve and protect the rajah of a given land. The tasks they performed varied, but they would obey without question. For example a single crusader may have acted as bodyguard for any member of the royal house and their family or as a guardian of foreign diplomats. They served as military advisers and, if needed, banded together to defend their nation.

In return for this dedicated service, the rajah provided any goods they might have needed.

==Culture==
Maquar crusaders followed a strict code of conduct in their service to the rajah and Estagund as a whole. Prospective members had to live by this code a month before they were allowed admission into their ranks. Failure to adhere to these tenets led to expulsion and the loss of having an honored rank within society.

The code of the Maquar stated that: 
* A crusader would obey the raja, or their appointed intermediary, without question.
* They could hold no jobs and accept no payment, in goods or gold, for their work.
* The Maquar were expected to assist the public of Estagund in time of need.
* Crusaders could own no possessions beyond their sword and armor, clothing to wear, and whatever personal affects that could be carried on their person. (Members that served as [[paladin]]s of the [[Adama]] were allowed their war [[mount]] and riding gear.)
* They could own no house or home, beyond that which was given to them by the rajah (though they could ask for one night of room and board from a citizen of Estagund, who was expected to oblige).

All Maquar crusaders were also followers of the tenets and faith of the Adama.

==Abilities==
A crusader's training focused on their devotion to protecting their charge. They trained in throw themselves in harm's way whenever they faced a lethal threat.

Their marital training involved developing attacks made from a defensive posture, capable of deflecting incoming blows. Alternately, they could counter with a broad attack made to smite their foes down.
