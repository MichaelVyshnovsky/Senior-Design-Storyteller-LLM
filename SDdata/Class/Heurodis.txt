Heurodis was a powerful medusa sorceress who sought to revive the Netherese flying city of Undrentide and use it to gain great power for herself.
She managed to reawaken and bind to herself the power of the mythallar powering the city, turning into a lich from its power and managed to make the city take flight again. Just as Undrentide was rising up from the sands of Anauroch, the mythallar was destroyed and Heurodis killed by an adventurer who was the former student of Drogan Droganson, whom Heurodis had killed previously.
