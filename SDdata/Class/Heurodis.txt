'''Heurodis''' was a powerful [[medusa]] [[sorceress]] who sought to revive the [[Netheril|Netherese]] flying city of [[Undrentide]] and use it to gain great power for herself.

==History==
She managed to reawaken and bind to herself the power of the [[mythallar]] powering the city, turning into a [[lich]] from its power and managed to make the city take flight again. Just as Undrentide was rising up from the sands of [[Anauroch]], the mythallar was destroyed and Heurodis killed by an adventurer who was the former student of [[Drogan Droganson]], whom Heurodis had killed previously.
