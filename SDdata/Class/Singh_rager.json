        "mainbody": "'''Singh ragers''' were warriors who took inspiration from [[lion]]s and were known for their discipline and fury in battle. They were found in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Culture": "The qualities of the lion (''singh'' or ''singha'' in some languages), believed to be ferocious but noble, inspired singh ragers to fight with the same ferocity but without sacrificing control and discipline. For their unequally bravery, strength, and swiftness, they were viewed as ideal warriors, but many found them frightening for controlled rages.\n\nThey usually served as retainers and champions to their rulers, from princes to emperors. Their discipline and law-abiding nature made them useful in such roles.\n\nSingh ragers were found in the [[Malatra]] lands of [[Laothan]] and [[Purang]] and especially in the [[Kuong Kingdom]].{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|63}}",
        "Prerequisites": "To be a singh rager, one must be a veteran warrior of disciplined and lawful nature and an iron will. Thus, most were [[fighter]]s and [[samurai]], yet a few [[monk]]s and [[sohei]] trained hard to follow the path.",
        "Abilities": "Like a lion's roar, the singh rager's ''ki'' shout became more effective and it could send foes fleeing in terror. They could do it more frequently too. Later, they combined this with their combat technique, roaring as they struck.\n\nLike a [[barbarian]] of other lands, a singh rager could enter a battle frenzy, known as lion's fury. This enhanced strength and resilience, as well as mental defense, at the cost of their own safety. They could do this three to five times a day and grew more powerful as they progressed.\n\nBelieved to have a lion's courage, they knew no fear and their minds were resistant to magical influence. They would fight on even at the point of death when others would have fainted.\n\nThey would also pounce like a lion, by charging into the fray and making complete attacks at enemies. Finally, with the swiftness of the lioness, they could accelerate themselves as with a ''[[haste]]'' [[spell]].\n\nLike other warriors, they were skilled in athletics, warcraft, and staring down opponents."
