        "mainbody": "Singh ragers were warriors who took inspiration from lions and were known for their discipline and fury in battle. They were found in Kara-Tur.\nThe qualities of the lion (singh or singha in some languages), believed to be ferocious but noble, inspired singh ragers to fight with the same ferocity but without sacrificing control and discipline. For their unequally bravery, strength, and swiftness, they were viewed as ideal warriors, but many found them frightening for controlled rages.\nThey usually served as retainers and champions to their rulers, from princes to emperors. Their discipline and law-abiding nature made them useful in such roles.\nSingh ragers were found in the Malatra lands of Laothan and Purang and especially in the Kuong Kingdom.\nTo be a singh rager, one must be a veteran warrior of disciplined and lawful nature and an iron will. Thus, most were fighters and samurai, yet a few monks and sohei trained hard to follow the path.\nLike a lions roar, the singh ragers ki shout became more effective and it could send foes fleeing in terror. They could do it more frequently too. Later, they combined this with their combat technique, roaring as they struck.\nLike a barbarian of other lands, a singh rager could enter a battle frenzy, known as lions fury. This enhanced strength and resilience, as well as mental defense, at the cost of their own safety. They could do this three to five times a day and grew more powerful as they progressed.\nBelieved to have a lions courage, they knew no fear and their minds were resistant to magical influence. They would fight on even at the point of death when others would have fainted.\nThey would also pounce like a lion, by charging into the fray and making complete attacks at enemies. Finally, with the swiftness of the lioness, they could accelerate themselves as with a haste spell.\nLike other warriors, they were skilled in athletics, warcraft, and staring down opponents."
