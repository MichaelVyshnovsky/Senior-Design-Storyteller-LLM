        "mainbody": "The Lady Knights of the Silver Moon were famed swordmaidens who worshiped Lurue, the Unicorn Queen.\nLady Knights adventured throughout Northwest Faer√ªn in Lurues name. Their reputation for martial prowess rivaled that of Silverymoons defenders.\nThese warriors wore either silver chainmail, or elven chainmail if they could afford it. Their shields were polished to a mirror shine. In combat they preferred a lance while mounted and the longsword for melee exchanges."
