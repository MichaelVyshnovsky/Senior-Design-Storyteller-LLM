Shevarash () was the elven deity of revenge, loss and hatred of the drow.
Shevarash appeared as a  tall, muscular green elf wearing elven chainmail an a shadowy cloak.
Shevarash appeared to Yuirwood elves in the aspect of Elikarashae.
Shevarash was constantly consumed by thoughts of retribution and bitterness, dominated by hate and revenge to a degree unseen in any of the other Seldarine. He was taciturn and emotionless, aside from anger and the brief exultation after a victory. The Black Archer was disdainful of moderation in the pursuit of revenge regardless of the interests of peace, and would often strike preemptively against his foes.
Shevarashs weapons were the Black Bow and the sword Traitorbane. In his aspect of Elikarashae, he wields the spear Shama, the sling Ukava and the club Maelat.
Shevarash was a member of the Seldarine, and specifically considered Fenmarel Mestarine his superior, though the two had little in common besides opposing the drow. He was particularly aligned with the more militant members, and worked closely with Corellon and Solonor Thelandira especially, though their focus on defending elven realms rather than making war on those of the drow frustrated the Black Archer.
Shevarashs endless, untiring crusade was such that the only long-term divine allies he made after his apotheosis were those who shared his hatred of the drow, such as Psilofyr and Callarduran Smoothhands, though as humans began to venture more often into the Underdark he began to work with some deities of theirs such as Shaundakul and Hoar. Much to the dismay of other members of the Seldarine, Shevarashs bitterness and grief led him to, as of 1371 DR, begin to seek solace in Shars embrace.
Shevarash held himself first and foremost as an enemy of Lolth, and then of the rest of the Dark Seldarine. Eilistraee was the exception to this rule, for while he still disliked her followers thoroughly he tempered his hate towards them and would not attack them out of hand. To a lesser extent, he was an enemy of other evil deities of the Underdark, including Blibdoolpoolp, Pisaethces, Deep Duerra, Diirinka, Diinkarazan, the Great Mother, Gzemnid, Ilsensine, Maanzecorian, Ilxendren, and Laduguer.

The church of Shevarash was tiny, but rigidly disciplined. Clerics spent their days drilling, designing tactics, mapping out the Upper Underdark, and leading hit-and-run raids and assaults on drow territories.
Clerics of the Black Archer prayed for their spells at dusk, just as the drow snuck into the surface world. The holiest day of the year for the church was Midwinter night, during which the Dark Court Slaughter was remembered. Inductions into the ranks of the clergy occurred at this time. Each new cleric screamed vows of vengeance into the night air and swore neither to laugh nor smile until the Spider Queen and her followers were no more.
In the year , in an event that would eventually be called the Dark Court Slaughter, an army of drow and duergar emerged from the Underdark and assaulted a meeting between the surface elves and dwarves. Shevarash was one of the few survivors. Falling to his knees amongst the carnage, the Black Archer swore an oath to Corellon Larethian to neither laugh nor smile until Lolth and her brood were destroyed.
In the year , Shevarash the Black Archer died, but with the help of Fenmarel Mestarine underwent Apotheosis to become the Night Hunter and Arrow Bringer. This green elf demigod of the Seldarine was still a hunter and vengeful destroyer of drow, but now hunted Lolth and Vhaeraun directly (though he came to no longer consider Eilistraee and her worshipers to be among his prey).
