Sonnlinor were specialty priests devoted to Moradin, the Soul Forger.
The majority of sonnlinor were shield dwarves or gold dwarves, but members of all of the dwarf races, both male and female, could become a sonnlinor.
Sonnlinor were often skilled blacksmiths, armorers, weaponsmiths, or masons.
In addition to their normal spells, sonnlinor could cast animate weapon, command, strength of stone, protection from paralysis, spiritual hammer, dispel magic, stone shape, stonefire, flame strike, defensive harmony, and soul forge on a daily basis. Additionally, they could cast true seeing four times per day and elemental aura five times per tenday.
Sonnlinor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the armor they were allowed to wear. Most favored the warhammer.
