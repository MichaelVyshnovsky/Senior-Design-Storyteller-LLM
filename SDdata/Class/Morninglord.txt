'''Morninglords''', formerly known as '''morninglords of Lathander''', were the [[specialty priest]]s of the deity [[Lathander]], considered to be among the most elite orders, as well as one of the highest ranks, within his [[church of Lathander|clergy members]].

==Activities==
These respected priests served as dedicated healers and councilors to the followers of Lathander and other folks in communities throughout [[Faerûn]]. They protected the people from all manner of malign forces and were known as fervent destroyers of the [[undead]].

Very often, they traveled the Realms as preachers, bringing the glory of the sun to all dark places of the world and garnering greater respect of their church.

==Culture==
The morninglords of Amaunator drew on the optimistic spirit that was embodied by the aspect of Lathander. They were considered the embodiment of his youth and personification eternal renewal. They were relentless and unrestrained in their actions, spreading the light of the sun to all the dark and chaotic corners of [[Toril]].

==Abilities==
As priests of Amaunator and Lathander, morninglords acquired their abilities through [[divine magic|divine grace]] channeled through a [[holy symbol]]. Due to their god's influence over the sun, morninglords were adept at wielding [[radiant]] powers which could be both benevolent or violent in nature. The power of the morninglords' magic grew with the increased force of their personality and their continued training. 

They gained access to several spells befitting their role in the church, such as ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[daylight]]'', ''[[Sunrise (spell)|sunrise]]'', ''[[boon of Lathander]]'', ''[[searing ray]]'', and ''[[false dawn]]''.

The [[prayer]]s spoken by morninglords focused the light of their god to destroy their foes or aid and heal their allies. The ''[[pure glow]]'' prayer allowed them to radiate brilliant holy light that burned their enemies, while the ''[[rising sun]]'' prayer focused that sight light into a healing force that soothed the wounds and spirits of their friends and allies. 

At sunrise, they could choose to perform the ''[[blessing of the dawn]]'' which boosted their morale and convictions for a matter of hours.

Their ability to ''turn undead'' was unparalleled by other priestly orders. Experienced morninglords could inflict the greatest amount of harm possible to undead creatures.

Another prayer that venerated morninglords learned was the ''[[rejuvenation of the morn]]''. While this could only be performed once a [[tenday]], it was capable of some truly great restorative effects.

The most powerful morninglords exuded an ''aura of radiance'' around themselves at all times. The light of Lathander himself shone down upon them, giving them sight in darkness and protection from the undead.

==History==
In the centuries before the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, morninglords were referred to as the "morninglords of Lathander". During this time, Lathander was viewed by the people of Faerûn as the [[greater deity]] of the sun, rather than an aspect of the ancient [[Netherese pantheon|Netherese]] god Amaunator. 

In the time between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]], the morninglords switched their devotion to Amaunator. It was believed by many that the aspect of Lathander was merely a youthful facade that was worn by the austere and stern Amaunator. For about a century's time, the morninglords continued to exemplify the youthful joy and exuberance that they believe was put forth by the Keeper of the Sun.

Following this time, both Amaunator and Lathander held their own place within the [[Faerûnian pantheon]].

==Members==
As would be expected, the majority of morninglords were [[cleric]]s, though there were a considerable number of [[paladin]]s among their ranks.

==Notable Morninglords==
* [[Chansobal Dree]], leader of the church in [[Marsember]].
* [[Ghentilara]], overseen of the [[Spires of the Morning]] in [[Waterdeep]].
* [[Hathala Orndeir]], high priestess of the [[Tower of the Morn]] in [[Elversult]].
* [[Haurier Brightshadow]], a dawnknight within the [[Order of the Aster]].
* [[Ombital Dusrook]], head of the Lathanderite church of [[Ordulin]].
*[[Una]], an adventuring [[cleric]] of [[Lathander]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/94/Sidekicks|18}}
