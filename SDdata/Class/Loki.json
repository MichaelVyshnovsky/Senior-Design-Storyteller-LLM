        "mainbody": "'''Loki''' was an interloper [[deity]] of mischief and strife who originated from another [[earth|plane of existence]].There were no known worshipers of Loki in the Realms. However, Loki is mentioned in ''[[Desert of Desolation]]'', a 1st-edition adventure. And is stated in [[Planes of Chaos (boxed set)|''Planes of Chaos'']] as having interacted with [[Sel√ªne]].",
        "Avatar": "Loki's avatar was typically that of a handsome man, dressed in red and black. However, he often took on a variety of forms, most often that of a woman. But no matter what guise he took, he sported red and black clothing.",
        "Personality": "Loki had a rather conceited and greatly vain nature to him, being convinced that there was nothing any deity could do that he couldn't. He strove to prove himself as being smarter than the rest of his pantheon.\n\nHe excelled at subverting the natural order and finding solutions or answers that his fellow gods had not considered,{{Cite dragon/110/For Better or Norse: II|27}} and easily bored. He often resorted to amusing himself by playing practical jokes on other deities.",
        "Abilities": "Loki was capable of creating [[magic item]]s related to [[assassin]]s and [[rogue]]s. He was also proficient in spellcasting, being capable of casting a number of spells innately and as a sorcerer. The spell-like abilities that Loki was capable of casting innately included:\n:''[[animate objects]]'', ''[[blasphemy]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[chaos hammer]]'', ''[[circle of doom]]'', ''[[cloak of chaos]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[create undead]]'', ''[[desecrate]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', ''[[dispel good]]'', ''[[dispel law]]'', ''[[earthquake]]'', ''[[false vision]]'', ''[[harm]]'', ''[[implosion]]'', ''[[inflict critical wounds]]'', ''[[inflict light wounds]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[magic circle against good]]'', ''[[magic circle against law]]'', ''[[mislead]]'', ''[[nondetection]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', ''[[protection from good]]'', ''[[protection from law]]'', ''[[screen]]'', ''[[shatter]]'', ''[[summon monster IX]]'', ''[[time stop]]'', ''[[unholy aura]]''. ''[[unholy blight]]'', ''[[word of chaos]]'', ''[[shapechange]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''.\n\nThe actual spells that Loki was capable of casting as a sorcerer included:\n:''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[arcane eye]]'', ''[[arcane mark]]'', ''[[bestow curse]]'', ''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[circle of death]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[contact other plane]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[daze]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect poison]]'', ''[[dream]]'', ''[[erase]]'', ''[[flesh to stone]]'', ''[[gate]]'', ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[mage hand]]'', ''[[mass charm]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', ''[[nightmare (spell)|nightmare]]'', ''[[obscure object]]'', ''[[open/close]]'', ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]'', ''[[prestidigitation]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[rope trick]]'', ''[[secret page]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[shadow walk]]'', ''[[shrink item]]'', ''[[simulacrum]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', ''[[temporal stasis]]'', ''[[trap the soul]]'', ''[[vampiric touch]]'', ''[[vanish]]'', and ''[[wish]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Loki wielded a ''[[dagger of venom]] +3'', with an endless supply of venom,<ref> and possessed a pair of boots that were [[enchanted]] with the powers of ''[[fly]]ing'', ''[[speed]]'', and ''[[water walk]]ing''.[[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities & Demigods'']] and ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume I]]'' both state that the full powers of these boots are ''flying'', ''speed'', '''travelling''', and ''water walking''. This third term likely refers to ''boots of travelling and leaping'', an item found only in OD&D and that was part of the powers that Loki's boots had in that edition. Considering that this term was likely copied over in error, it has been left out of this article.",
        "History": "Some myths claimed that Loki had the blood of [[giant]]s flowing through him, being born to giants named Farbauti and Laufey, while others claimed he was born alongside Odin.\n\nIn the early days of the pantheon, he used his wits to the benefit the Norse powers. Proving instrumental in saving the pantheon from certain death and destruction on a number of occasions, earning him the title of Odin's blood brother. When he later become more of a trickster, Loki would bring up these past exploits whenever he pushed the Norse powers to their limits.\n\nOver the years, Loki often turned to the [[Ysgardian dwarves]] for help in his schemes. At some point, Loki's trickery caused the Norse goddess [[Sif]] to lose her hair and he was forced to replace it. Loki approached a pair of Ysgardian dwarves for this task, who made locks from [[gold]] that grew like real hair. Flushed by their success, and challenged by Loki to outdo their success with that hair, the dwarves went on to construct many of the legendary weapons and equipment of the Norse pantheon.\n\nLoki gradually grew envious of the beautiful, near-invulnerable Norse power [[Balder]] Loki planned to kill him one day with a spear made of his one weakness, [[mistletoe]]. Some claimed that he had tricked his blind twin [[Hod|Hod the Blind]] into throwing a sharpened [[dart]] of the plant at Balder's heart. In other accounts it was a spear But according to others, Loki's scheme had been a success and it started him down a path towards greater [[evil]]. Finally, there were some accounts that said Balder was indeed dead, but that his death was not the cause of Loki.\n\nSome centuries prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], a group of Norse worshipers from another world brought their faith to the [[Raurin Desert]] of [[Toril]] and formed cities, such as [[Medinat Muskawoon]]. Though they did not worship Loki, they were aware of him in the stories they had of Balder, a Norse power who they did construct a temple to.\n\nLater he would visit the [[Gates of the Moon]] on several occasions, trying to woo the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon|Faer√ªnian goddess]] [[Sel√ªne]].",
        "Activities": "Loki was sometimes sent by Odin on missions to cause mischief among the [[Celtic pantheon|Celtic]] and [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian]] pantheons.\n\nWhile in his divine realm on the plane of [[Pandemonium]], Loki worked on his sorcery and plotted schemes, often plotting ways in which he could mess with the [[Blood War]]. Occasionally siding with the [[tanar'ri]] of the [[Abyss]], but more often sending [[fire giant]] and [[frost giant]] servitors to mess with both sides.",
        "Realm": "Loki maintained several small houses in [[Asgard]] and had many hideaways in both [[Jotunheim]] and [[Pandemonium]], which he hid away in when he had drawn the ire of other powers. He was most often exiled into hiding in Pandemonium after causing strife among the [[Norse pantheon]]'s deities<ref> and in fact only resided there when not on good terms with them. While there he resided in [[Winter's Hall]],\n\nHe was also one of a number of Norse powers that sometimes took to hiding in [[Merratet]], the divine realm of [[Bast]].<ref>",
        "Relationships": "Loki was quite sociable among the Norse pantheon when in their good graces, Despite his mischievous ways, Loki was largely tolerated by the Norse pantheon because of his status as a blood brother to Odin.\n\nAmong the Norse powers he was sworn enemies with [[Heimdall]], partly because of Loki being unable to stand his self-righteous nature\n\nLacking the aid of his fellow Norse powers, Loki made short-term alliances with deities across various [[pantheon]]s, mainly treating them as pawns or tools in his schemes. He was also one of the few gods that the Olympian power Ares considered a friend, even though Loki enjoyed embarrassing him at any chance he got.",
        "Worshipers": "The priests of his faith typically wore a leather vest and wolf helmet as part of their priestly vestments. They had to access spells from the [[all sphere|all]], [[charm sphere|charm]], [[Combat sphere|combat]], [[Creation sphere|creation]], [[divination sphere|divination]], [[elemental sphere|elemental]], [[healing sphere|healing]], [[plant sphere|plant]], and [[summoning sphere|summoning]] [[sphere]]s. They particularly had access to the spells ''shapechange'' and ''[[mass suggestion]]''. Many of priests were, in addition to being [[cleric]]s, rogues and sorcerers.\n\nUnlike other Norse deities, Loki did not require his followers to perform any particular religious services or rituals. though it as more common for cults of Thrym to hold a grudge against those of Loki.<ref> Giants in general were typically welcomed in his temples, which in many worlds were hidden in either a cave or building. These were often stocked with supplies for causing mayhem, including [[poison]] and weapons.\n\nHe most attracted the worship of assassins, rogues, and in some worlds the [[yuan-ti]].<ref>"
