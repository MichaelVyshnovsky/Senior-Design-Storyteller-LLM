Shadow adepts were spellcasters who fearlessly reached out to the Shadow Weave and acquired power that took others much longer to achieve.
Each and every shadow adept was solely concerned with becoming more powerful. Thus, those of non-evil alignments who singularly refused to be under the control of the goddess Shar, were absent from the ranks of these dark individuals. Shadow adepts made great sacrifices in their ability to tap the Weave in order to gain great power from the Shadow Weave.
Shadow adepts could go beyond their racial abilities, and thus could see well in dim light or even complete darkness. These spellcasters were able to create a sphere of shadows that provided protection and concealment against enemies. Shadow adepts could create identical clones of themselves using their mastery of shadows. These clones had the shadow adepts abilities but did not retain the weapons and armor of their creator.
