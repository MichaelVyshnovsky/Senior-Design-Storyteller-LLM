'''Thrym''' was a titan worshiped by the [[frost giant]]s as the [[giant pantheon|giant god]] of cold and ice. He was the ''de facto'' leader of the frost giants as well.

==Description==
Thrym appeared as an exceptionally large frost giant. He typically wore [[chainmail]] and a coat made of white fur.

==Personality==
When not directly preparing for war, Thrym was known to be fairly aloof, wandering his realm restlessly.

==Powers==
Thrym could breathe a devastating ''[[cone of cold]]'' out to 100 ft (30 m) and was completely immune to cold- or ice-based attacks. Only highly magical weapons could even touch him enough to injure him. He often granted frost giants the ability to use [[arcane]] magic like a [[wizard]].

==Possessions==
His signature weapon was a large double-bladed ''[[greataxe]]''.

==Realm==
Thrym ruled the realm of Fimbulwinter, with a stronghold and festhall known as Nyfholl. In the [[World Axis cosmology]] this was located in in the [[Elemental Chaos]] and described as a wide tundra illuminated by sparkling frozen waterfalls.

In the [[World Tree cosmology]] his domain was located in the [[plane]] of [[Jotunheim]]. It was said to be mountainous, but still filled with snow, ice, frost, and glaciers. He was said to roam the mountains and glaciers of this plane, rather than maintaining a permanent residence.

In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], instead of the domain of Fimbulwinter he co-ruled the entire plane of Jotunheim alongside his brother [[Surtur]]. Much like the World Tree cosmology, he was said to wander the plane with a company of giant jarls.

==History==
At some point Thrym forged a [[magical item|magic]] ''[[warhammer]]'' by the name of ''[[Matalotok]]''.

==Relationships==
Thrym was a son of [[Annam All-Father]].

Thrym was known to have a rivalry with his twin, Surtur. Since birth, the two had competed to be the first at everything.

At some point, Thrym fathered the frost giant [[Utgard-Loki]], who would grow to become ruler of the city of [[Utgard]] in Jotunheim.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|17,23}} Much later he fathered the [[Empyrean]] [[Nalkara]] with [[Auril]], goddess of winter.
