Eshowdowan shamans were specialty priests devoted to Eshowdow, the Shadow Giant within the Chultan pantheon.
Eshowdowan shamans were involved in planning the downfall of the tabaxi.
Eshowdowan shamans were always humans of Eshowe descent. They all participated in the summon shadow spirit incantation upon becoming a shaman.
These individuals specifically communicated with the spirits of dead Eshowe. The spirits they contacted could invoke a number of magical powers on their behalf including chill touch, spook, scare, spectral hand, Lorloveims creeping shadow, spirit armor, wraithform, enervation, fear, shadow monsters, shadow door, shadow magic, shades, and shadow walk.
They used a variety of weapons including hand axes, blowguns, clubs, kerrie, spears, and yklwas. Armor usually consisted of dinosaur hide, Eshowe scale mail, or leather armor.
