'''Halcyons''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Aerdrie Faenya]], the Winged Mother.

==Culture==
All halcyons were [[elves]], [[half-elves]], [[aarakocra]]s, or [[kenku]]s.

==Abilities==
Halcyons had access to [[magic]] from the [[elemental air school]].

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, halcyons could cast ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[Murdock's feathery flyer]]'', ''[[ride the wind]]'', ''[[whispering wind]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', ''[[air walk]]'', ''[[control winds]]'', ''[[flight of Remnis]]'', ''[[control weather]]'', and ''[[wind walk]]'' once per day. Particularly powerful halcyons could summon an [[air elemental]] to serve them once per [[tenday]]. They could all ''[[shapechange]]'' into any type of [[bird]] up to three times per day.

==Possessions==
Halcyons only wore [[leather armor]] or [[elven chainmail]]. Common weapons carried by a halcyon included [[dart]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[bow]]s used with [[flight arrow]]s, [[blowgun]]s, [[javelin]]s, [[mace]]s, [[quarterstaves]], [[spear]]s, and [[staff-sling]]s.
