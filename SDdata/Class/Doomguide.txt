'''Doomguides''' were the [[specialty priest]]s, [[cleric]]s, [[paladin]]s and other devotees who served the God of the Dead, [[Kelemvor]]. They lent their aid to the people of [[Faer√ªn]] by helping them with their fears of death and uncertainty about the afterlife. They engrossed themselves in everything surrounding the blasphemous state that was [[undeath]], in order to best root out all forms of [[necromancy]] and destroy all manner of their [[undead]] servitors, in order to bring a measure of peace to the world.

==Activities==
First and foremost, the primary duties of doomguides involved the consolation of the dying, showing reverence to the dead, and providing comfort to those who were left to grieve and deceased. They were shepherds of souls, who aided them in their journey from [[Toril]] to the [[Fugue Plane]]. Like other priests of the faith, doomguides officiated funerals, particularly those of great importance. They performed ''[[resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' [[ritual]]s when it was warranted, particularly when members of their own faith were slain.

Beyond this, doomguides were tasked with the eradication of necromantic practices, along with anyone who propagated the existence of the undead. To this end they often traveled with [[adventuring companies]], aiding them when presented with the threat of the undead. While important, their roles as undead hunters was entirely secondary.

Doomguides served Kelemvor in a manner different that the clergy's other priests, acting as couriers between his temples and bringing aid to everyone across the lands. They were expected to travel far and wide, to spread Kelemvor's teachings regarding the [[afterlife]] share with mortals what they will face after death.

==Culture==
As they were considered to be literal "guides" to the dying and their loved ones, doomguides were often very compassionate and found great personal fulfillment in their duties. In contrast with their other responsibility of destroying the undead, doomguides found a unique duality, that often left them reflective upon death itself.

To Kelemvor and his doomguides, there were no greater abominations than the undead. The more militaristic of these divine servants trained throughout their entire careers to free these souls and send them on their way to the [[City of Judgment]]. To aid them in their efforts, Kelemvor granted the doomguides with some measure of his power and grace, instilling them with a power over undeath that fills these monstrosities and their masters with fear.

As the philosophy of Kelemvor's church was often divided, doomguides often favored one aspect of their responsibilities over the other. By exemplifying Kelemvor's stance of neutrality, doomguides maintained their understanding that need to both lay the undead to rest and comfort the dying were both necessary to their faith, regardless of their personal preferences.

==Abilities==

In an academic sense, doomguides fully engrossed themselves in the world of undeath. They studied extensively in [[necrology]], the discipline that involved the in-depth study of undead creatures,

One of the most essential powers for doomguides was the ability to prevent undeath. To this end they were taught the ritual known as the ''[[rite of the passing]]''. By touching a corpse and completing the ritual a doomguide was able to prevent a body from being raised, save for divine intervention.

Early on in their training, doomguides study the means to ''[[speak with dead|speak with the dead]]''.

Doomguides were taught a number of [[prayer]]s that armed them with the power necessary to eradicate the undead. ''[[Kelemvor's circle]]'' functioned as more powerful version of their already potent ability to ''[[turn undead]]'', while ''Kelevor's sword'', previously known as ''bond of Fatal Touch'', allowed them to imbue their weapon with [[radiant]] energy akin to Kelemvor's personal [[bastard sword]], ''[[Fatal Touch]]''.

In the years prior to the [[Spellplague]], doomguides were able to form a sphere of energy that drew creatures from the [[Ethereal plane]], and forced them to the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]].

[[Image:Doomguide fight.png|thumb|right|180px|''An doomguide faces down the undead.'']]To defend themselves experienced doomguides built up a resistance to necrotic energies increases, [[energy drain]], and [[death magic]]. 

With enough training, the most experienced doomguides could attain complete immunity to such effects, conjure forth ''[[Bloodstone's spectral steed|ghostly steeds]]'', and even summon a being known as a ''[[minor death]]'', which ironically enough resembled an undead skeleton wielding a [[scythe]].

==History==
At some point in the 1480s [[DR]], a number of doomguides went missing in the beleaguered city of [[Neverwinter]]. They were tasked with eliminating scored of undead within the [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath Graveyard]] and wound up descending into a location known as [[the Rift]].

==Relationships==
Many doomguides joined the Kelemvorite [[Knights of the Eternal Order]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}}

==Members==
Joining the prestigious ranks of the doomguides was a challenge for many servants of Kelemvor. Due to their more combat-oriented duties, many [[fighter]]s and [[paladin]]s sought the life of a doomguide, alongside the [[church of Kelemvor|Kelemvorite]] [[cleric]]s, though the latter were required to stay true to Kelemvor's moral outlook. In truth, any divine servant of the god could join the order's elite ranks.

The training required to master the necessary skills was rigorous and essential for survival and success. Many of the doomguides were already able to ''turn undead''  as well as [[speak with dead|speak with them]].

==Notable Doomguides==
* [[Antara o' Bones]], Keeper of Crypts of the Tomb City of [[Sheirlantar]].
* [[Volahk]], Knight of the Eternal Order and protector of the Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter.
