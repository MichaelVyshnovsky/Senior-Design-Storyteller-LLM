        "mainbody": "Zeus was a multispheric interloper deity of the sky and head of the Olympian pantheon.There were no known worshipers of Zeus in the Realms. However, Zeus is mentioned in the Realms adventures Desert of Desolation and No Time to Lose, the former in relation to the deity Prometheus who was worshiped in Medinat Muskawoon. For this reason, Zeus is documented in this article.\nHis avatar typically took the form of a robust male human with regal bearing, dressed in a white tunic. He had white hair and a full, long white beard, and stood  tall. His avatar was not seen to wear armor, for he disdained it.\nZeuss true form was that of a ball of fiery light, whose radiant light was so intense that no mortal could look upon him without bursting into flames or dying.\nZeus was an efficient, yet slightly despotic leader, who was fickle in his administration of justice. He was more passionate than logical, moved more often by anger than mercy, and at times made his decisions on the basis of politics rather than justice. He also played favorites, though whom these were could change on a whim. Finally, he was a notorious lecher and womanizer, willing to go to any length to woo women that caught his eye. \nZeus was not above toying with the lives of mortals for the purpose of entertainment, but ultimately cared for mortal life, though in the way that a distant father cared for his children. Following the Time of Troubles he was far less liable to meddle on the Prime Material plane, as the punishment for doing so had become more quick and severe.\nthumb|273px|The holy symbol of Zeus.\nWhenever Zeus was wounded and spilled blood upon the earth, his blood would transform into a random monster that would fight on his behalf for a period of 48 hours or until he was slain.\nZeus had a wide variety of spell-like abilities that his avatar form could cast. These included the following\n aid, air walk, animate objects, Bigbys clenched fist, Bigbys crushing hand, Bigbys grasping hand, blade barrier, bulls strength, call lightning, chain lightning, chaos hammer, cloak of chaos, control weather, control winds, demand, discern lies, dispel evil,  dispel law, divine favor, elemental swarm (air only), endure elements, enthrall, fog cloud, gaseous form, geas/quest, greater command, holy aura, holy smite, holy word, ice storm, lightning bolt, magic circle against evil, magic vestment, obscuring mist, protection from evil, protection from law, repulsion, righteous might, shapechange, shatter, sleet storm, spell immunity, stoneskin, storm of vengeance, summon monster IX, whirlwind, wind wall, and word of chaos.\nthumb|273px|A close-up view of the Aegis shield.\nZeus possessed an +5 enchanted shield known as Aegis,\nIn terms of weaponry he possessed a large +5 shortspears with the weapon qualities shocking burst and thundering. which were initially forged for him by the Olympian cyclopses and later by the combined efforts of them and the Olympian deity Hephaestus.\nZeus was among the first six Olympians, born to the Greater Titans Cronus and Rhea. After a curse was placed upon the former by their mother Gaea, swearing that one day his children would usurp him Cronus proceeded to swallow each of his first five children  These first five children were Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hestia, and Poseidon. in swaddling clothes, A few lesser titans allied with them in this war, such as Prometheus, and thus were spared the fate of their fellows.\nAfter this war concluded, Zeus drew lots with his brothers Hades and Poseidon to determine which of them would govern the portfolios of sky, the sea, and death. He ultimately became the lord of the upper air and general ruler of the Olympians.\nIn the years that followed Prometheus deceived him on multiple occasions. One such incident involved him mentioning a prophecy he foresaw, one in which Zeus mated with a woman who would bear a son that surpassed him. Zeus would try pry the specifics of this prophesy from him by many means, but ultimately nothing worked.\nThe final straw for Zeus was when Prometheus circumvented a prohibition he made of bestowing fire upon their pantheons worshipers the summit of the colossal Mount Aetna in their home plane of Olympus, with magical chains that were virtually impossible to break unless Zeus willed it.\nFollowing her divorce from his brother Poseidon, Zeus wedded his sister Demeter and bore the goddess Persephone. This child would later be abducted into the Underworld by their brother Hades, after Zeus gave him permission to marry her without Demeters knowledge. She ran off in search of Persephone after hearing her cry for help, doing so for nine days before she learned that Hades had taken her. She then went into mourning, wandering listlessly for some time, However, Persephone had already sealed her fate by partaking in the food of Hadess realm. Zeus would intervene in the matter, brokering a compromise that allowed Persephone to spend part of her time in the underworld and part of her time in Olympus, what mortals would consider equivalent to six months.\nSome time after this Demeter parted ways with Zeus and he went on to marry their mutual sister Hera, who would later bare him the deity Ares. Some speculated their marriage was merely a symbolic gesture, meant to placate Heras jealousy and affirm his standing as head of the Olympians. Zeus then went on to have many affairs while married to her, with women both divine and mortal, fathering more members of their pantheon and a great deal of mortals. Most of the latter when on to become adventurers. Some rumors claimed that even Hera didnt know of all the children that Zeus had fathered with mortals.\nWith the Greater Titan Leto he had the twins Apollo and Artemis. Zeus then went on to make love with a minor goddess by the name of Maia, who bore him the son Hermes.This is reasoned to have occurred after the birth of Apollo and Artemis because the sourcebook On Hallowed Ground states that Apollo is the \"older brother\" of Hermes. With a mortal named Semele he had the son Dionysus.\nAt some point Hera found out about these and many other affairs he was having and so in retaliation created Hephaestus wholly from her body. When Zeus discovered this he was enraged at her insolence and hurled Hephaestus down on to the Prime Material plane. Some time later Zeus would reconcile with him and make Hephaestus a welcomed member of the Olympian pantheon.\nSome time after this he mated with a woman named Metis. After being told a prophecy that she would bear a son whod kill him, Zeus went on to follow the example of his father and swallowed her. This eventually led him to develop a horrible headache, which Hephaestus sought to relieve by splitting Zeuss head open with an axe, from which the Olympian goddess Athena emergedThe 3 edition Deities and Demigods sourcebook states on page 112 that Athena, \"...sprang from Zeusâ€™s head with no mother.\" As this is a Core sourcebook, the lore given in the Planescape book On Hallowed Ground regarding Athenas parentage is given precedence. Though since that book does not detail how she sprung from Zeuss head, the lore from Core sources is used for that herein.\nHe was also alleged to have bore the Olympian Pan to an unnamed woman, but this was only one of three alleged origins for that deity.\nZeus resided with his wife Hera in a great citadel atop Mount Olympus, in the divine realm of Olympus. It was made of polished marble and gold, inlaid with gold and precious gemstones, and only their worshipers could see its entrance. The halls were lined with statues of Zeus and Hera, which were rumored to come to life to dispose of unwanted intruders or to roam the realm of Olympus on his behalf.\nA celestial,\nHis command in the Olympian pantheon was far from absolute, with the other members often arguing, challenging, or contesting his decisions. He would step in whenever they crossed him or threatened damage to one another and to a certain extent he encouraged their chaotic behavior.\nOut of all his children Zeus doted upon Athena and Dionysus, much to Heras chagrin in the latter case as she viewed that deity as a reminder of Zeuss many affairs. Hera was very suspicious of activities, keeping a close eye on him, yet he would still attempt to use his shapeshifting powers to sneak out of their palace and engage in affairs.\nOutside of the pantheon, the deity that Zeus considered his rival was Daghdha and his Celtic pantheon as a whole to be rivals of him and the Olympian pantheon. Some speculated that their simmering feud could erupt into all-out war at some day.\nThe priests of his faith typically wielded spears as weapons. They wore white tunics for priestly vestments. These and their holy relics incorporated Zeuss favored animals or plants. They had access to spells from the spheres of all, animal, combat, divination, elemental, healing, protection, and weather, and wards. They particularly had access to the spells lightning bolt and polymorph self. They also were liable to know the spells control weather and control winds.\nHis clergy taught that nothing in the world, good or ill, happened without his consent and that Zeus never sent destruction without some cause so people should simply to accept whatever life throwed their way.\nAmong the clerics of the various Olympian deities, those of Zeus enjoyed a position of prestige that earned them some respect, despite Olympian clerics overall not caring much for the concept of church hierarchy.\nWherever Olympians were worshiped, a temple to Zeus could be found.\nIn the Outlands a sprawling temple to Zeus stood within The Ladys Ward of the city Sigil.\nIn Greatspace he was worshiped as the crystal spheres creator, whose inhabitants believed they were created by him to be his most highly prized worshipers after he grew tired of the petty actions of his mortal followers in some other sphere.\nOut of the philosophical planar factions of the multiverse, Zeus was worshiped by some members of the Fraternity of Order and Sign of One.\nLegends spoke of Zeus having two jars outside the entrance to his citadel on Mount Olympus. One of them filled with the qualities of evil and the other with the qualities of good, with only deities able to tell which was which. These rumored jars were said to be used by Zeus to bless or curse mortals, but that the qualities of each jar could also be mixed to create human spirits."
