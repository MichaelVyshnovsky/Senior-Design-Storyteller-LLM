        "Personality": "Zeus was an efficient, yet slightly despotic leader, who was fickle in his administration of justice. He was more passionate than logical, moved more often by anger than mercy, and at times made his decisions on the basis of politics rather than justice. He also played favorites, though whom these were could change on a whim. Finally, he was a notorious lecher and womanizer, willing to go to any length to woo women that caught his eye. \n\nZeus was not above toying with the lives of mortals for the purpose of entertainment, but ultimately cared for mortal life, though in the way that a distant father cared for his children. Following the [[Time of Troubles]] he was far less liable to meddle on the [[Prime Material plane]], as the punishment for doing so had become more quick and severe.",

        "History": {
            "History of Affairs": "Following her divorce from his brother Poseidon, Zeus wedded his sister Demeter and bore the goddess [[Persephone]]. This child would later be abducted into the Underworld by their brother Hades, after Zeus gave him permission to marry her without Demeter's knowledge. She ran off in search of Persephone after hearing her cry for help, doing so for nine days before she learned that Hades had taken her. She then went into mourning, wandering listlessly for some time,{{Cite dragon/113/Welcome to Hades|26}} However, Persephone had already sealed her fate by partaking in the food of Hades's realm. Zeus would intervene in the matter, brokering a compromise that allowed Persephone{{Cite dragon/113/Welcome to Hades|26}} to spend part of her time in the underworld and part of her time in Olympus, what mortals would consider equivalent to six months.\n\nSome time after this Demeter parted ways with Zeus and he went on to marry their mutual sister Hera, who would later bare him the deity [[Ares]]. Some speculated their marriage was merely a symbolic gesture, meant to placate Hera's jealousy and affirm his standing as head of the Olympians. Zeus then went on to have many affairs while married to her, with women both divine and mortal, fathering more members of their pantheon and a great deal of mortals. Most of the latter when on to become [[adventurer]]s. Some rumors claimed that even Hera didn't know of all the children that Zeus had fathered with mortals.\n\nWith the Greater Titan [[Leto]] he had the twins [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]]. Zeus then went on to make love with a minor goddess by the name of [[Maia]], who bore him the son [[Hermes]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note3\">This is reasoned to have occurred after the birth of Apollo and Artemis because the sourcebook ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' states that Apollo is the \"older brother\" of Hermes. With a mortal named [[Semele]] he had the son [[Dionysus]].\n\nAt some point Hera found out about these and many other affairs he was having and so in retaliation created Hephaestus wholly from her body. When Zeus discovered this he was enraged at her insolence and hurled Hephaestus down on to the Prime Material plane. Some time later Zeus would reconcile with him and make Hephaestus a welcomed member of the Olympian pantheon.\n\nSome time after this he mated with a woman named [[Metis]]. After being told a prophecy that she would bear a son who'd kill him, Zeus went on to follow the example of his father and swallowed her. This eventually led him to develop a horrible headache, which Hephaestus sought to relieve by splitting Zeus's head open with an axe, from which the Olympian goddess Athena emergedThe 3{{rd}} edition ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' sourcebook states on page 112 that Athena, \"...sprang from Zeus’s head with no mother.\" As this is a Core sourcebook, the lore given in the Planescape book ''On Hallowed Ground'' regarding Athena's parentage is given precedence. Though since that book does not detail how she sprung from Zeus's head, the lore from Core sources is used for that herein.\n\nHe was also alleged to have bore the Olympian [[Pan (deity)|Pan]] to an unnamed woman, but this was only one of three alleged origins for that deity."
        },
        "Realm": "Zeus resided with his wife Hera in a great citadel atop [[Mount Olympus]], in the [[divine realm]] of Olympus. It was made of polished [[marble]] and [[gold]],<ref> inlaid with gold and precious [[gemstone]]s, and only their worshipers could see its entrance. The halls were lined with statues of Zeus and Hera, which were rumored to come to life to dispose of unwanted intruders or to roam the realm of Olympus on his behalf.",
        "Relationships": "A [[Celestial creature|celestial]],\n\nHis command in the Olympian pantheon was far from absolute, with the other members often arguing, challenging, or contesting his decisions. He would step in whenever they crossed him or threatened damage to one another and to a certain extent he encouraged their chaotic behavior.\n\nOut of all his children Zeus doted upon Athena and Dionysus, much to Hera's chagrin in the latter case as she viewed that deity as a reminder of Zeus's many affairs. Hera was very suspicious of activities, keeping a close eye on him, yet he would still attempt to use his ''shapeshifting'' powers to sneak out of their palace and engage in affairs.\n\nOutside of the pantheon, the deity that Zeus considered his rival was [[Daghdha]] and his [[Celtic pantheon]] as a whole to be rivals of him and the Olympian pantheon. Some speculated that their simmering feud could erupt into all-out war at some day.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Temples": "Wherever Olympians were worshiped, a temple to Zeus could be found.\n\nIn the [[Outlands]] a sprawling temple to Zeus stood within [[Sigil/The Lady's Ward|The Lady's Ward]] of the city [[Sigil]].<ref>",
            "Notable Worshipers": "In [[w:c:spelljammer:Greatspace|Greatspace]] he was worshiped as the [[crystal sphere]]'s creator, whose inhabitants believed they were created by him to be his most highly prized worshipers after he grew tired of the petty actions of his mortal followers in some other sphere.\n\nOut of the philosophical planar factions of the multiverse, Zeus was worshiped by some members of the [[Fraternity of Order]] and [[Sign of One]]."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Legends spoke of Zeus having two jars outside the entrance to his citadel on Mount Olympus. One of them filled with the qualities of [[evil]] and the other with the qualities of [[good]], with only deities able to tell which was which. These rumored jars were said to be used by Zeus to bless or curse mortals, but that the qualities of each jar could also be mixed to create human [[spirit]]s."
