        "mainbody": "'''Tuneservants''' were the [[specialty priest]]s serving [[Milil]], the ''Lord of All Songs''.",
        "Activities": "Tuneservants were among the most adventurous members of their clergy, and would join adventurers on their quests in order to compose ballads narrating their exploits. Others embarked on solitary expeditions, trying to find rare instruments or recover forgotten songs from ages past. They would also protect or rescue musicians who were facing dangers, from the common minstrels to the greatest bards.\n\nSome Tuneservants commanded over [[temple]]s in remote areas. Such temples were easily recognizable by the modern&mdash;sometimes disconcerting&mdash;music and songs played inside.",
        "Abilities": "Most tuneservants were skilled singers, poets, musicians and songwriters. They were usually quite wise and charming.\n\nTuneservants could [[enthrall]] their audience by singing, or cause the pitch of their voice to [[shatter]] things by singing a long, sustained note. They gained several spells they cast using their musical abilities, including [[music of the spheres]], [[unearthly choir]], [[shout]], [[forgotten melody]], [[harp of war]] and [[Melisander's harp]]. They also learned several magical songs such as [[song of compulsion]], [[song of suggestion]], were able to [[stone tell|speak with rocks]] and could trap short tunes into rocks to create [[singing stone]]s. The tuneservant affinity to music was such that they were also able to [[dispel silence]].",
        "Possessions": "Tuneservants tended to train with and favor bludgeoning weapons such as [[club]]s and [[mace]]s, and could be seen wearing any kind of [[armor]].\n\nTuneservants usually wore golden nets to hold their hair in place, as opposed to regular [[priest]]s of Milil who cut theirs short."
