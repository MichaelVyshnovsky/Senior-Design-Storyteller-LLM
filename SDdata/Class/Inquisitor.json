        "mainbody": "Inquisitors were those paladins who dedicated themselves to the eradication of all evil-aligned spellcasters, whether practitioners of arcane or divine magic.\nThese paladins were considered quite scholarly among their fellow holy warriors. They were often quite systematic and thoughtful in their actions.\nThey regarded magic with great reverence and could not abide it being used in some corrupted manner.\nInquisitors trained themselves to see through illusion magic and protect their minds from certain debilitating magical effects such as charm, hypnotism, suggestion, and even mental domination.\nThey learned to uncover and even dispel all manner of evil magic they encountered.\nTo focus on these skills, Inquisitors forewent the ability to learn priestly spells and could not heal others with their touch, as other paladins could.\n* Keldorn Firecam, a knight of the Order of the Radiant Heart in Amn."
