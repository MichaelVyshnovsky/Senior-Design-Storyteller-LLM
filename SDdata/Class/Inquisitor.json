        "Culture": "These paladins were considered quite scholarly among their fellow holy warriors. They were often quite systematic and thoughtful in their actions.\n\nThey regarded magic with great reverence and could not abide it being used in some corrupted manner.",
        "Abilities": "Inquisitors trained themselves to see through [[illusion]] magic and protect their minds from certain debilitating magical effects such as ''[[Charm person|charm]]'', ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', and even ''[[Dominate person|mental domination]]''.\n\nThey learned to ''[[detect evil intent|uncover]]'' and even ''[[dispel magic|dispel]]'' all manner of evil magic they encountered.\n\nTo focus on these skills, Inquisitors forewent the ability to learn [[priest]]ly spells and could not heal others with their touch, as other paladins could.",
        "Notable Inquisitors": "* [[Keldorn Firecam]], a knight of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]] in [[Amn]]."
