Delvesonns were specialty priests devoted to Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain.
The vast majority of delvesonns were shield dwarves or urdunnirin, but members of all of the dwarf races, both males and females, could become a delvesonn. Particularly powerful delvesonns were sometimes selected by Dumathoin to become his chosen.
Delvesonns were always skilled blacksmiths or weaponsmiths. They also excelled at mining and mountaineering.
In addition to their normal spells, delvesonns could cast fist of stone, detect metals and minerals, meld into stone, stone shape, stoneskin, and passwall on a daily basis. Additionally, they could cast identify at will and stone tell three times per day. Dumathoins blessing protected a delvesonn at all times similar to wearing a ring of mind shielding, protecting their mind from magical intrusions of psionics and spells such as ESP, detect lie, etc.
Delvesonns did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the armor they were allowed to wear.
