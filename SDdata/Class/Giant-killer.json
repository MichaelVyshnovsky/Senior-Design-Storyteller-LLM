        "mainbody": "Giant-killers, otherwise known as giant slayers, were adventurers who devoted their lives to hunting and killing giants and giant-kin, usually driven by a need to avenge some past deed committed by one. Elves and dwarves were the most common races to take up this way of life.\nGiant-killers were known to be very agile fighters, skilled in targeting the weak points of their foes. Due to their narrow obsession with giants, they tended to be very knowledgeable about how to track down or sneak up on them, but also how to tailor their attacks to whichever race of giant they were facing. These tactics were also applicable to ogres and trolls.\nthumb|273px|A group of dwarves gather around a dwarven giant-killer and his latest slain giant in awe.\nMany of the tactics that giant-killers in Faerun utilized were developed by shield dwarfs. On the isle of Oman, giant-killers utilized techniques that were developed by Northlanders.\nGiant-killers were known to often wear over-sized armor. Many sought out magical girdles and gauntlets of strength, inspired by old legends. They typically utilized two-handed weapons, such as bastard swords and battleaxes, as well as hurled weapons. Bows, crossbows, and slings were viewed by some as being weapons fit for only cowards.The book does not specify that the \"magical girdles\" are girdles of giant strength, though due to the nature of this kit being focused around giants it can be assumed. Some were known to decorate their shields with ribbons and medals awarded to them by grateful communities.\nGiant-killers generally traveled alone or in small groups.\nSome good-aligned giant killers were known to linger on killing good-aligned giants, waiting until they did something that would warrant their death. However, understandably all giants regardless of their alignment detested giant killers.\nMany giant-killers arose and flocked across Faerun to the Evermoors in the ,  when giants began to invade the region and displaced its troll population into the Silver Marches. Around this time they were considered an invaluable asset in the regions outskirts, especially in the city of Nesm√©. However, some were more driven by greed than an obsession to slay giants and would refuse to lend their services for low rewards.\nAround this same time, the dwarven settlements of Citadel Felbarr and Mithral Hall were known to have warriors skilled in the art of giant killing, though those of the former rarely lent their services out to any other settlement.\nthumb|right|300px|A half-orc giant-slayer\n* Cazi Alphelandra\n* Crag Ungart\n* Ghelryn Foehammer\n* Holper Stoutshield\n* Helena Nostrum\n* Lai Antolio\n* Solara Thann\n* Urgala Meltimer\n* The Blood Riders\n* Hook, Line, and Sinker\n* The Savage Seven\nGiant-killers were equally as likely to receive adoration as they were to be targeted by local bullies and tough guys for harassment"
