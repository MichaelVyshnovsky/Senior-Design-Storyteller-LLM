        "mainbody": "Traders were Azuposi rogues who earned a living traveling and trading wares with other communities.\nThey spent their time traveling between the many different settlements of the Azuposi.\nTraders were wealthy by Azuposi standards. This earned them both a degree of respect and a fair share of envious glares.\nThey were skilled bargainers and generally got along well with others.\nTraders dressed like most Azuposi, save for random accessories they accumulated during their far travels. A trader would usually dress appropriately for each village they visited, proving to the natives that they had been there before. They wielded clubs, slings, daggers, or short bows."
