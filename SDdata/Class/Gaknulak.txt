'''Gaknulak''' was the [[lawful evil]] [[kobold]] [[demigod]] of trickery and [[trap]]-setting, as well as stealth and ambushes, but also their god of protection.

==Description==
Gaknulak appeared as a {{SI|3'6"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall, dark-skinned kobold with white hair and a [[cloak]] with bulging pockets.

===Manifestations===
Gaknulak's omens were either understated or difficult to decipher (sometimes both). Triggered trap defenses, misplaced objects, and rearranged clothing or weapons could all be subtle clues, challenging his priests to understand them or even detect them at all.

==Personality==
In contrast to his skilled but blindly aggressive and easily tricked master [[Kurtulmak]], Gaknulak was not only highly intelligent, but also supremely pragmatic. In this sense he was a kind of [[lawful]] trickster god, a sneaky deity with an aversion for direct confrontation.

==Powers==
Gaknulak moved on land with remarkable speed, flying through the air twice as fast and swimming through water as fast as most maneuvered on the surface. He could cast [[transmutation]] and [[illusion]] spells, but was immune to illusions himself.

==Possessions==
Gaknulak possessed a magical [[cauldron]] from which he could draw several useful objects and diverse resources, including tools and even minor [[magical item]]s. These were meant for use by the highly intelligent to fool others.

Gaknulak was known to wield a [[hand axe]], his avatar possessing a ''+3'' enchanted one. His avatar also wore two [[ioun stone]]s (both randomly selected types) and always kept many magical items for the purpose of spying, detecting, and escaping, typically in the form of ''[[boots of speed]]'', a ''[[wand of magic detection]]'', and a ''[[ring of chameleon power]]''. In addition, avatars also had a ''[[wand of polymorph]]'' for the sake of offense, turning targets into [[pig]]lets so that they could be eaten.

==Divine Realm==
Gaknulak lived in the realm of [[Aknuthrak]] on [[Khalas]], the first layer of the [[plane]] known as the [[Bleak Eternity ofÂ Gehenna]].

==Activities==
Gaknulak was a protector god who not only defended his charges but also taught them how to defend themselves, namely through practical trickery. He was always prepared to send an avatar to show them a new means of self-defense through creative innovation.

==Relationships==
Gaknulak was a servant of Kurtulmak, the leader of the kobold pantheon, and did his best to achieve his master's goals through his practical innovations. Kurtulmak himself was a jealous god constantly wary of other deities, tolerating Gaknulak because he had magical control over him.

Gaknulak preferred defense and trickery to direct confrontations regarding other deities and races.<ref> he was known to have had his doubts about his superior's attempts at revenge in the past, needing to be dragged into the quarrel.

==Worshipers==
Priests of Gaknulak were first and foremost defenders of their lairs and homelands. They acted as spies and scouts and were experts in constructing defenses, setting traps, and laying all sorts of ambushes. Becoming a priest of Gaknulak required a certain level of intelligence, and they were skilled in hiding, spotting traps, and setting them in such a way that they would not be detected. Later on, they could make use of low-level illusion spells and cast ''[[rainbow pattern]]''.

Gaknulak also had [[shaman]]s, who sometimes came into conflict with the more war-focused shamans of Kurtulmak. When these branches of kobold religion did cooperate however, the race would become much more dangerous than their size would imply.

==History==
While it was Kurtulmak who first taught the kobolds the skills of ambushing, Gaknulak eventually grew to dominate this sphere.

There was a time when Kurtulmak forced Gaknulak to support him in trying to booby-trap a citadel of the gnome gods. His subordinate's misgivings were soon validated when Kurtulmak, hardly being subtle, was detected immediately by the guards and sent home by the gnome deities after being ridiculously trussed up.
