        "mainbody": "'''Glyphscribes''' were specialty priests devoted to [[Deneir]], the Lord of All Glyphs and Images.",
        "Activities": "Glyphscribes were focused with gathering any form of written knowledge so that it would not be lost. Whether they did this from the comfort of a library, or by exploring the vastness of [[Toril]] depended on the nature of the individual.",
        "Abilities": "Given their close association with Deneir, glyphscribes had a stronger chance of resisting or avoiding any traps or other negative effects triggered from reading or touching books, [[scroll]]s, or other magical inscriptions.\n\nThese individuals were incredibly skilled with languages, usually being fluent in well over a dozen different tongues.\n\nGlyphscribes could identify magical runes including the type of person or creature who created the rune and the rune's general meaning.\n\nSeveral magical abilities became available on a daily basis to glyphscribes as they gained power including ''[[glyph of warding]], [[glyph of revealing]], [[dispel magic]], [[amanuensis]]'', and ''[[symbol]]''. They could use a ''[[speak with dead]]'' power up to four times per day.",
        "Possessions": "Glyphscribes wielded one-handed bludgeoning weapons in combat. They were permitted to wear [[armor]] as heavy as [[banded mail]] and they never carried [[shield]]s."
