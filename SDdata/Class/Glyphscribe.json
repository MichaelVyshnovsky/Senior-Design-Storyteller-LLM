        "mainbody": "lyphscribes were specialty priests devoted to Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs and Images.\nGlyphscribes were focused with gathering any form of written knowledge so that it would not be lost. Whether they did this from the comfort of a library, or by exploring the vastness of Toril depended on the nature of the individual.\nGiven their close association with Deneir, glyphscribes had a stronger chance of resisting or avoiding any traps or other negative effects triggered from reading or touching books, scrolls, or other magical inscriptions.\nThese individuals were incredibly skilled with languages, usually being fluent in well over a dozen different tongues.\nGlyphscribes could identify magical runes including the type of person or creature who created the rune and the runes general meaning.\nSeveral magical abilities became available on a daily basis to glyphscribes as they gained power including glyph of warding, glyph of revealing, dispel magic, amanuensis, and symbol. They could use a speak with dead power up to four times per day.\nGlyphscribes wielded one-handed bludgeoning weapons in combat. They were permitted to wear armor as heavy as banded mail and they never carried shields."
