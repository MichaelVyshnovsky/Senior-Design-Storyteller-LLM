The '''Circle of Dreams''' was a [[druid circle]] closely associated with the [[Feywild]] and the realms of dreams. The [[druid]]s of this circle sought to infuse the natural world with the ethereal, wondrous qualities shared by benevolent [[fey]].

==Activities==
These druids sought to heal the wounded in body, mind, and spirit by nurturing the sense of wonder in the hearts of the oppressed. They watched over the truly wild lands of the Realms, where the fabric between the the natural world and places beyond was most easily pulled aside. 

Some others sought merely to share their inner restorative light with others—unfortunately, in some cases, at significant financial cost.

==Culture==
Circle of Dreams druids were blessed by the [[Summer Court]], the realm of [[Titania]], Queen of the Fey.

==Abilities==
These druids formed within them a well of healing energy, which they could call upon to aid others.

Experienced druids learned to call upon the shadows of the [[Gloaming Court]] to protect and their allies while they rested.

Over time, they developed means to tap into the invisible magical pathways used by the fey to traverse the Realms in mere moments. By all appearances, any druid utilizing these paths appeared to ''[[teleport]]'' for a distance up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. They could also bring someone along in this supernatural means of travel, up to half that distance.

Some of the most powerful Circle of Dreams druids mastered the ability to traverse [[dreamscape]]s at will. They could [[Scrying (spell)|view great distances away]] via dreams, [[dream|step into and influence the dreams of others]],  and [[teleportation circle|create portal]]s to the last place they'd slept on any given [[plane of existence]].
