        "mainbody": "Orbs were specialty priests of the Church of Iyachtu Xvim who served as missionaries by spreading the ugly word of Iyachtu Xvim through blackmail and intimidation. They were named for Xvims glowing green eyes.\nAn orbs primary mission was to recruit new followers for Iyachtu Xvim in order to increase his influence. They usually did this by orating charming speeches about Cyrics failure and Xvims resurgence. Anyone who failed to see the wisdom in following Xvim was confronted privately with threats.\nOrbs were obsessed with finding and destroying the Cyrinishad to the point where it would take precedence over recruiting followers if an orb received any information about the books whereabouts.\nThese individuals could turn and command undead. They were immune to all forms of normal and magical fear and could cast the fear spell once per day. They could not cast any spells from the creation sphere.\nOrbs garbed themselves in long black cassocks, black iron skullcaps, and green stoles. Their black gauntlets had green eyes painted on the back of the hand and actually served as their holy symbol. Orbs wore their cassocks over armor, which was usually chainmail. Their weapon of choice was the warhammer."
