This ranking was not the \"order of strength\" but the \"order of seniority\". This ranking had no hierarchical meaning, but higher ranked ones were more likely to be helped by lower ranked ones. This ordering of seniority was not questioned. Even by those who were more important to the organization but were not an eye for a long time.\nIncompetent ones like the drow eye of Xanathar Korask Nevae were avoided by the others.\nWeaker eyes jobs revolved around information gathering and bribery, which included charming people into compliance. Stronger eyes jobs were the same but of a more important nature and included assassinations.\nWhen an eye died, a new one was recruited into their ranks. The Xanathar sometimes killed eyes like the aforementioned Korsak for incompetence.\nAll eyes of Xanathar were trained in backstabbing their enemies, stealth, intimidation, observation, and had some general insight in matters of Waterdeep.\nAll eyes of Xanathar were given an Eye of the Master. It was a minor artifact, An eye learnt to draw out more powers from it as he or she mastered his or her arts as an eye. Its powers included an improvement to the users sight. They gained low-light vision and/or darkvision depending on their skill with it. They also gained magical divination abilities like the ability to use detect magic, see invisibility, and true seeing. Particularly proficient eyes could let the Eye of the Master fly around and see through it.\nThese powers could be used by holding the Eye of the Master before the eyes eye. More adept ones could let it float before their eye. Even more adept ones grew a physical retractable tentacle from the back of their heads. By attaching the Eye of the Master to this tentacle, the eye of Xanathar could shoot eye rays in a fashion similar to the beholders from the artifact. The possible rays were charm person, hold monster, inflict moderate wounds, and poison.\nTheir mundane abilities were the abilities to backstab, which they could enhance with the help of their Eye of the Master, special skills in the usage of poison, and complete knowledge of the Xanathars Thieves Guild portal network.\nThe most important possession of any eye of Xanathar was the Eye of the Master. It was the focus of most of an eyes abilities. It was such a powerful tool that the Xanathar believed it to be enough of a reward to its eyes.\nAfter working for one year or more, an eye was given a jet-black suit of studded leather armor. This armor was special. First, it had a subtle eye on the chest. It seemed to darken the area around the eye and the eye could hide easier in an area that was not bright to begin with. Second, enchanting this suit of armor was done at a 20% discount by a mage of the thieves guild.\nThere existed eleven eyes of Xanathar. Together, they formed the Eleven Eyes of Xanathar. They were the most trusted agents of Kirukeskai, who held the title \"the Xanathar\". Specifically, they were its spy-assassins. Their duties included feeding the Eye with information and killing its obstacles. Kirukeskai gave them access to the thieves guilds most important secrets, each an Eye of the Master, direct help on demand, and a lot of freedom. For example, they were allowed to pursue their own agenda. However, the Xanathar had the last say in everything they did. Incompetent eyes were killed or even eaten by the Xanathar. The Xanathar usually helped an eye on demand, but had a low opinion of those who asked its help too often.\nEach one of the eleven eye of Xanathar was chosen by one of the eleven Masters of the Xanathars Thieves Guild. However, the Masters were not the eyes superiors. An eye of Xanathar reported to the Xanathar and not to the Master who chose him or her. Some Masters tried to undermine the eye, particularly the one from his or her part of the guild, but those attempts were generally exceeded by fear from the Xanathar or simple loyalty to the thieves guild.\nThe eyes of Xanathar had a good relationship among themselves. They were not averse to help each other. However, it was rare for more than two eyes to work on the same task. This was due to the danger of an excess of cross purposes.\nAt some point during the 14 DR, the Xanathar ordered its Masters to choose one agent. They were to send this agent to their superior. After and assessment process conducted by the beholder itself, the agents who passed became the Eleven Eyes of Xanathar. Those who failed the intrusive assessment process went insane.\nAttracius He was the Fifth Eye.\nGarag The Ninth Eye wanted to collect information about a wizard, who visited Waterdeep for an annual gathering.\nGuillaume The Eighth Eye believed information to be vital for his organizations success.\nKorask Nevae The Eleventh Eye was particularly incompetent. He was devoured by the Xanathar after not completing a typical assignment."
