        "Description": "Unlike many other archdevils, Bel retained a resemblance to a [[pit fiend]],{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Aspects II|2}}",
        "Personality": "Calculating and calm in his assessments, Bel was one of the greatest military minds in the Nine Hells, using every tactical advantage available and only engaging in battle on his own terms. His favored tactics involved ambushes, double-crosses, feints and counter-feints, and backstabbing his enemies while anticipating the treacherous moves of his rivals. While he occasionally erupted with anger upon being foiled, he was generally cool-headed—a far cry from the constant, fiery fury of Zariel.\n\n{{Fq\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| source = Bel lamenting the unexpected honor of another party\n| text   = We didn't even sign a contract!\n}}\nCunning, analytical and, above all, a realist, Bel was fully aware that [[demon]]s were infinite in number, if not literally then effectively, and so depended on slow defensive advances to fend them off. He was a long-term logistician, and in his mind the most he could do was contain the endless hordes of the [[Abyss]]. Even if victory only lasted a day, he valued the assistance of anyone, mortal or otherwise, and gave fair hearings to those who offered. Though certainly [[evil]] and sadistic, his duties came before his amusements.\n\nAlmost impossible to surprise, but he was a shrewd negotiator who, as one might expect, kept his promises to the letter and cared less about their spirit. Perhaps Bel's only psychological weakness was his disdain for and suspicion of [[magic]], preferring martial rather than magical might.",
        "Powers": "Bel's powers were simply those of a physically and magically enhanced pit fiend. His sheer presence could be so overwhelming that weaker beings of virtue were left paralyzed with [[fear|terror]], while others were struck with [[awe]].\n\nAs a general, Bel preferred to fight from afar and never went into battle without minions to command, always using variety when summoning aid. He used [[cornugon]]s as aerial attackers and seemingly favored summoning [[gelugon]]s, which he used to deal with the most hard-hitting opposition. \n\nBel himself let loose destructive [[spell]]-like abilities like [[wall of fire|walls of fire]] when in combat, rarely deigning to enter melee himself unless he held some advantage and even then rarely committing to it.{{Cite organized play/LC/Another Serious Matter|27}} before later being said to detest magic, ultimately making him unpredictable in terms of his method of attack.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Bel.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''Bel wielding his infamous blade and wearing a gruesome belt.'']]\nBel's personal [[weapon]] was his jagged ''+3 [[flaming]] [[greatsword]]'', a strangely curved [[blade]] that radiated heat and was covered in flames. Bel's blade was effective against both demons and cold-based creatures. Demons everywhere knew of and feared the weapon, for it was used to slay thousands of their kind over the course of the [[Blood War]]. The weapon had also been used to neatly sever the heads of at least a dozen [[angel]]s, their decapitation not preventing them from screaming while attached to his [[:Category:Belts|belt]].\n\nAside from his belt, Bel also wore a highly enchanted ''[[ring of protection]] +5'' at all times.",
        "Realm": "{{Main|Avernus}}\nBefore becoming Archduke of Avernus, Bel inhabited a fortress likely larger than any on the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Constructed from [[basalt]], [[marble]], [[granite]], and [[iron]], and configured with a description-defying sense of infernal logic, Bel's keep was incredibly well-fortified. It was surrounded by gigantic mountains, enclosed by a {{SIAdj|30|ft|long=yes|adj=tall}} iron fence with screaming skulls at the top, and featured various thick gates, jagged fences, spiked walls, protruding towers, and sharp angles. Guarding it were hordes of [[lemure]]s, [[abishai]], [[barbazu]], and other [[fiend]]s, some of which could perceive [[invisible]] objects and individuals, and most of which would gleefully eviscerate intruders. The entire stronghold exuded a feeling of hate, suffering, and wicked delight, and seemed to guarantee harm to anyone that came too close.\n\nAfter ascending and becoming the Lord of Avernus, Bel ruled its wastes from the impregnable city known as the [[Bronze Citadel]]. Formerly a fortress of actual [[bronze]], the original structure merely served as Bel's personal quarters where he strategized with the Dark Eight and held meetings with his inner court. The city itself was always in a state of expansion, with work crews of lemures, [[soul shell]]s, [[imp]]s, and other slave laborers fortifying it and adding new defenses. The Citadel encompassed an over {{SIAdj|600|mile|k|adj=long}} territory encircled by fourteen concentric ring walls with barbazus, [[merregon]]s, and [[spinagon]]s, housed within the bulwark.\n\nEach ring had several guard towers and a gate guarded by dangerous devils. These rings were outfitted with an unstoppable array of [[ballista]]e, [[catapult]]s, magical relics, and other war machines. It was a utilitarian structure, with half of the wall support being bone scaffolding, and the rear of the unimaginative city was built on the foothills adjoining the [[Stigamaris Mountains]]. When captured adventurers came to plead their cases and travelers requested letters of safe passage, they would have to contend with either Bel's lieutenants or the Warlord of Avernus himself inside its walls.\n\n{{Fq\n| width  = 300px\n| source = ''[[The Cartographer]]''\n| text   = An ousted archduke sulking in a volcano, eager to reclaim his stolen throne. \n}}\nAfter being deposed, Bel made his home in an iron fortress carved out of a volcano. The bastion acted as a forge for Blood War weapons and [[armor]] and was protected by infernal legions and dark magic that [[divination|divined]] intruders.",
        "Activities": "Before Bel became archduke, he spent his time as a commander currying favor from his superiors,<ref group=\"note\">During 2{{nd}} edition, the identities of the archdukes were kept secret and had changed from the previous edition. Given recent contradictions regarding the order of Bel's and Zariel's ascents, Tiamat's arguable former station as an archduchess, and Bel's own subservience to the Dark Eight,  \"superiors\" is used in favor of a specific name or group. either by scouring Avernus of demon invaders or taking his legions through planar portals to hunt down [[tanar'ri]].

        "Relationships": {
            "Dukes and Outcasts": "Bel employed the services of various dukes throughout the Hells, such as [[Beleth]], the Prince of Imps, who would inform the newer archduke what his older and stronger peers were planning.{{Cite dragon/365/Codex of Betrayal: Beleth, the Witch's Viscount|42}} He was also a close ally, or at least a common employer, of [[Alloces]], the Butcher of Nessus. Alloces kept herds of monsters for him (as he did with other archdevils) and Bel frequently made use of Alloces' experiments and breeding programs to outfit his armies with new mounts and living weapons.{{Cite dragon/373/Codex of Betrayal: Alloces, the Butcher of Nessus|38,42}}\n\nVarious \"rabble of devilkin\"—powerful outcast devils who lurked in Avernus waiting for a chance to return to power—fought in Bel's armies during his reign. One was [[Moloch]], former Grand Duke of [[Malbolge]], who had managed to insinuate himself back into the Hells.{{Cite dragon/360/Infernal Aristocracy: The Dukes of Hell|42}} While the [[wolf]]-headed [[Amon (archdevil)|Amon]] didn't trust Bel given his past betrayal of his master, Bel's loyalty to Asmodeus, and the fact that Bel's former master sided with Baalzebul during the Reckoning, meant Bel was spared Amon's attempts to avenge his own master, [[Geryon]]. Bel gave him covert aid when Amon was working against their shared enemies, and instructed his legions to let him pass through Avernus unharmed, although this support would end if Amon's activities threatened him, the Dark Eight, or Asmodeus.{{Cite dragon/428/Codex of Betrayal: Amon the Wolf|26}}",
            "Servants": "Perhaps Bel's most perplexing relationship was with his vassals, the Blood War generals and [[baatezu]] administrators known as the [[Dark Eight]]. Nominally, the Dark Eight were Bel's councilors and reported to him, but in truth, it was the reverse.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|4}} Although he could theoretically crush all of them, and they had households in his Bronze Citadel, they spent most of their time in [[Nessus]], where Bel lacked any authority. Fortunately for Bel, the Dark Eight remained enthusiastically supportive of his continued reign while he excelled in the Blood War, with their satisfaction warding off rivals and treasonous servants. If Bel were to show any sign of serious weakness, however, their extreme loyalty over the centuries would likely come to an end.\n\nBel was protected by several pit fiend bodyguards even when not leading his armies. He also surrounded himself with warlike devils, such as cornugons, that led his legions.\n\nBel was also served by the Erinyes [[Oreasha]], who commanded great authority in the ranks of his armies.<ref>[[Jim Zub]] (February 2020). “[[Infernal Tides 4]]”. ''[[Infernal Tides]]'' #4 ([[En:IDW Publishing|IDW Publishing]]) (4)., pp. 2–4.",
            "Others": "Bel owed his success in becoming leader of Avernus in part to the assistance of the [[Sign of One]], a [[Sigil]]ian faction that believed their thoughts influenced the world around them. Their methods worked to some degree, and Bel was secretly sworn to repay them with a favor of equal magnitude when their faction leader requested him to do so."
        },
        "Worshipers": "Zariel's already-meager worshiper base scattered upon her defeat and didn't transfer their devotion to Bel, Worse yet, Tiamat's ever-present nature in Avernus led to her being mistaken as the true Lord of the First, keeping the Bellic worshiper base small.\n\nWhile Bel enjoyed cruelty and corruption, he wouldn't actively try to cause the fall of useful mortals in his employ, although as an entity of pure evil, he had a tendency to corrupt them even without conscious effort. Some of the most extreme [[paladin]]s sworn to an [[Oath of Conquest]] went so far in their quest for order that they dealt with the infernal forces of Hell, and many of these \"hell knights\" were the most ardent supporters of the Warlord of Avernus.\n\nIt was important to Bel that those pledged to him succeeded in battle for as long as they lived, Those in Bel's service could call upon his power to manifest accursed green flames, which would dance across their weapons and overpower resistance to fire. His brand, the mark of one's service to him, was a [[cold iron]] [[longsword]] or greatsword that glistened with green [[hellfire]], which was particularly effective against [[good]]-aligned beings and even more so against demons.",
        "Aspects": "[[File:BelAspect.png|thumb|left|250px|''The avatar of Bel.'']]\nBel's [[avatar]] was a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes|adj=tall}} muscular [[humanoid]] with red-tinged skin whose fearsome scowl and imposing form frightened off most that might bother it. Bel's [[aspect]]s, meanwhile, appeared more like himself, and wielded flaming greatswords. \n\nThough Bel was normally too busy waging the Blood War to consider the complicated dealings of the Material Plane, he did recognize it—including [[Faerun]]<ref name= \"FAII\"/>—as another one of its battlegrounds. He sent his aspects, typically with devilish followers, to oppose demonic cults of particular importance or power. While this could be seen as a benefit, a devil's means of stopping demons could prove, in a different way, equally malevolent. Because of their fiendish methods, aspects of Bel were rarely appreciated more than the demons. However, they weren't above partnering with mortals, even if only temporarily, to defeat their targets, and sometimes carried items to entice service from them.<ref name= \"FAII\"/>\n\nOccasionally, despite his poor reputation, Bel used his aspects as ambassadors and subversives in the courts of other archdevils.<ref name= \"FAII\"/>",
        "History": {
            "Archduke": "When Bel managed to take the 1{{st}} layer of the Hells from his former master, the newly self-titled Lord of Avernus prepared for an assault, only to be met by [[Martinet]], Asmodeus's constable, who claimed the Lord of Nessus was impressed and had decided not to \"make him burn in the [[Pit of Flame]] for all eternity.\" So long as Bel kept fulfilling his obligation to the Dark Eight and fought the demonic hordes, he would be allowed control over Avernus; he happily accepted.\n\nHowever, as Bel would soon discover, Asmodeus had ulterior motives behind his support that only became evident after accepting. Knowing that no other Lord of Hell would trust the upstart rebel and that fighting the Blood War was a full-time job, Asmodeus had allowed Bel's coup to capitalize on Bel's military expertise while preventing him from plotting against other archdevils, and more importantly, himself. It was even said that the Dark Eight (famously loyal to Asmodeus during the [[Reckoning]]) had intentionally raised Bel to take the former lord's place.\n\nWith Bel standing high in his favor, in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, Asmodeus sent [[Sfena]], the daughter of [[Glasya]], to [[Toril]] to assassinate the daughter of a [[storm giant]] noble named [[Urdalshone]]. Urdalshone and a [[wizard]] of the surface world had been plotting to attack Avernus, and the assassination presumably would disrupt this for Bel's benefit. Although the assassination attempt failed, the overall results of the attack were unknown.",
            "Fallen": "When the fallen angel [[Zariel]] fell in [[1354 DR]] after her failed assault against Avernus, Asmodeus was so impressed with her that he rose her up and put her in Bel's place.<ref group=\"note\"> The date 1354 DR coincides with devils occupying [[Dragonspear Castle]], some way north of Elturel, also via portals from Avernus. However, a connection between them, or even which came first, is presently unknown.<ref group=\"note\">The story of the Hellriders has changed and evolved significantly in each edition. The 1{{st}}- and 2{{nd}}-edition campaign settings mention \"the story\" of a small rescue mission of a single person \"in the past\" from the perspective of [[1356]]/[[1357 DR]], but ''Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide'' and ''Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus'' expand this into a major campaign only two years before the 1{{st}}-edition account, which seems contradictory. It may be that the story has grown in the telling over 140 years and that elements have been misremembered or propagandized. Meanwhile, the change from rescue mission to major campaign suggests a case of \"mission creep\", giving extra cause for the deserters to abandon Zariel's crusade. All in all, given its horrific fate, they would seem to be the sensible ones.  Bel managed to return to power for a time, allegedly acting as Zariel's loyal vassal until she made one crucial mistake that led to her undoing—she trusted a devil. Older editions positioned Zariel as the original lord of Avernus and the one Bel originally usurped, having guilefully betrayed her millenia ago back during the [[Reckoning]] of Hell after spending centuries gaining her trust. The most recent edition, and furthermore its Realmsian sources, are considered to take precedent.\n\nHowever, Asmodeus eventually claimed that Bel's tactics were inadequate in defending Avernus from demonic incursions, reinstating Zariel as its archduke and relegating Bel to a supporting, advisory role. He once again played the part of the obedient servitor, waiting for any opportunity to permanently dispose of the fallen angel.\n\nBel actively, if subtly and deviously, attempted to sabotage Zariel's plans regarding [[Elturel]] and the [[The Companion]]."

        "Rumors and Legends": "One of the ''[[Teeth of Dahlver-Nar#Tale Teeth|Tale]] [[Teeth of Dahlver-Nar]]'', a magical collection of teeth each associated with a different legend, was called the \"[[Daughters of Bel]]\". It was a [[green steel]] pit fiend fang that allowed the wielder to summon a pit fiend or, if implanted in the user's own mouth, cast ''[[dominate monster]]'' once per day at the cost of constantly reeking of sulfur."
