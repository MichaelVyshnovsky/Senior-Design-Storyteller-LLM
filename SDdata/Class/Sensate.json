        "mainbody": "'''Sensates''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Sharess]], the Dancing Lady.",
        "Activities": "The vast majority of Sharess' sensates were [[human]], but [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and even [[halfling]]s could also join their ranks.",
        "Abilities": "Most sensates were skilled singers or dancers. Sensates were usually quite dextrous and charming.\n\nA sensate could ''fascinate'' up to three targets per day provided it was done in a noncombat situation. The affected target behaved as if they were under the influence of the ''[[suggestion]]'' [[spell]].\n\nSharess' hatred of [[Set]] translated to her sensates, providing them with a boost to their abilities when facing any minions of Set, including most snake-like creatures, in combat.\n\nA sensate was served by a loyal feline [[familiar]]. Additionally, sensates could ''[[Speak with animals|speak with felines]]'' at will. Any form of feline would never attack or harm a sensate unless provoked by the sensate. They could summon any form of great cat three times per tenday.\n\nSensates could use the following magical abilities once per day: ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[intensify sensation]]'', and ''[[memory wrack]]''.\n\nEspecially powerful sensates could negate the effects from a ''[[girdle of masculinity/femininity]]'' with their touch.",
        "Possessions": "Sensates were able to train with [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[khopesh]]es, [[sling]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[net]]s, and [[whip]]s. Any [[armor]] worn by a sensate was done in a provocative manner."
