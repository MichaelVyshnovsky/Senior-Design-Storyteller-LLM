        "mainbody": "ensates were specialty priests devoted to Sharess, the Dancing Lady.\nThe vast majority of Sharess sensates were human, but elves, half-elves, and even halflings could also join their ranks.\nMost sensates were skilled singers or dancers. Sensates were usually quite dextrous and charming.\nA sensate could fascinate up to three targets per day provided it was done in a noncombat situation. The affected target behaved as if they were under the influence of the suggestion spell.\nSharess hatred of Set translated to her sensates, providing them with a boost to their abilities when facing any minions of Set, including most snake-like creatures, in combat.\nA sensate was served by a loyal feline familiar. Additionally, sensates could speak with felines at will. Any form of feline would never attack or harm a sensate unless provoked by the sensate. They could summon any form of great cat three times per tenday.\nSensates could use the following magical abilities once per day charm person, alter self, charm monster, intensify sensation, and memory wrack.\nEspecially powerful sensates could negate the effects from a girdle of masculinity/femininity with their touch.\nSensates were able to train with clubs, daggers, khopeshes, slings, scimitars, nets, and whips. Any armor worn by a sensate was done in a provocative manner."
