'''Anatomists''' were a subtype of [[necromancer]] that specialized in a focus on the physical sciences, devoting themselves to the scientific study of bodies.

==Culture==
Those who traversed this profession typically went down one of two developmental routes. Most went down this path to further dark motives, becoming either "mad scientists" that created horrid experiments or experts in torturing that were sometimes employed by despots. These horrible experiments could lead to the creation of various types of [[golem]]s, such as [[flesh golem]]s

Out of all types of necromancers, anatomists were the ones most tied to civilization, as large towns and cities were the only places one could ensure a steady and safely procured supply of cadavers.

As some civilizations held taboos and stigmas with corpse dissection, anatomists often had to keep their experiments a secret. They would masquerade as "ordinary" doctors or non-necromancer wizards that had gained their knowledge from attending academic lectures or reading ancient text, rather than from first-hand experience.

==Abilities==
Above all the fields of study, anatomists were always skilled in [[anatomy]] and healing, acquired over many years of extensive study, making them far better doctors than most village healers. Because of their expertise in anatomy they were also quite skilled at determining a corpse's time and cause of death through performance of an autopsy.

Some anatomists were also known to have skills in herbalism, [[venom handling]], and various aspects of dealing with animals. Some were also skilled in the [[rogue]]ish arts of disguise and forgery out of necessity to better mask their life as anatomists. They rarely ever showed interest in [[netherworld knowledge]] or the creation and control of [[undead]], though sometimes found the latter useful for manual labor.

In terms of [[spell]]s, anatomists preferred those of the [[necromancy]] school whose effects directly affected physical bodies, either prior to or following death, often using magic to aid or better inform their research. This included such spells as ''[[bone growth]]'', ''[[corpse link]]'', ''[[delay death]]'', ''[[embalm]]'', ''[[empathic wound transfer]]'', and ''[[graft flesh]]''. They often hesitated to employ offensive magics, as they might risk making a corpse unsuitable for later study.

==Possessions==
Anatomists were typically garbed in the mantle and [[robe]]s of either a physician or scholar. They usually carried around their surgical tools, keeping them in a black leather bag or a small box. These surgical tools included such things as [[bonesaw]]s, [[knives]], [[retractor]]s, and [[scalpel]]s.

Due to their surgical precision, they preferred fighting with small edged or cutting weapons, starting with a simple knife. Later on they would take to handling such weapons as [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s, [[cutlass]]es, and [[short sword]]s.

==Notable Anatomists==
* [[Danna the Skull]], an anatomist that worked for the [[Forthright Band of Investigators]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/238/Gangsters of the Underdark|39}}
* [[Ellandra Tolbert]], a famous [[Neveren]] anatomist. She was born to an equally famous anatomist father, whom she assisted with dissections in her youth, and she was a member of the Anatomical Academy.
