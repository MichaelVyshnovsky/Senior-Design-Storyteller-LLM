==Description==
Bahgtru appeared as a gigantic, {{SI|16|ft|long=yes}} tall, incredibly muscular orc with dirty tan skin. His eyes were dull green and his tusks, that protruded from both sides of his mouth, glistened white due to his gnawing on bones.

===Manifestations===
The Leg-breaker's omens were known to come in the form of a splitting headache referred to as "Bahgtru's pat". He was also known to manifest through the sounds of angry howls and breaking bones.

==Personality==
Bahgtru was notorious for being staggeringly, legendarily stupid, infamously dumber than any god had the right to be. He was an unreasonably destructive deity said to be easily outfoxed by most beings, and had a lack of self-determination to go with his idiocy,

Despite having a complete lack of wisdom and being as dumb as a rock, the Leg-Breaker could understand the concepts of insults; if he discovered he had been deceived, he would crush the perpetrator into less than a pulp, and was known to "accidentally" injure those he was working with when not given proper respect.

==Powers==
Though moronic, Bahgtru was undeniably, incredibly mighty, even by the standards of gods. His skin was so thick that blunt weapons were practically useless against him, merely bouncing off of his tough hide. No effect (such as ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'') could drain his strength, nor could any magic reduce the harm he caused or protect one from his blows (like ''[[stoneskin]]'').

The massive Bahgtru was known as the "Fist of Gruumsh" for his bare-knuckle fighting style; in battle, he normally ran towards the nearest enemy and bashed them with a hammer fist before bowling the dazed victim into other foes with the back of his hand. He was smart enough to keep as many stunned enemies nearby as possible, particularly ranged attackers, making it difficult for anyone to escape his reach. Afterwards, Bahgtru simply descended into a series of different moves, hurling, slamming, pummeling, and crushing his opponents with his bare hands.

==Possessions==
Ever since a battle with a legendary beast, Bahgtru had never been known to use any kind of conventional weapons or armor, and beat his victims flat with a pair of [[cestus|cesti]], or [[gauntlet]]s, studded with steel rivets.

==Activities==
Left to his own devices, Bahgtru wreaked havoc in whatever area he happened to be in, such as the battlefields of the war between orcs and [[goblin]]s, challenging all manner of archetypal monsters to battle as he tore the land he traveled asunder. The Fist of Gruumsh fought at his father's behest, alongside him or otherwise, and often took orders from the One-Eyed God's other servants.

==Realm==
The orc pantheon was known to move between the planes in their war against the [[goblinoid pantheon]]. At one point they went from the [[Nine Hells]] to [[Acheron]], with Bahgtru inhabiting a smaller block orbiting the cube of [[Nishrek]].

In the [[World Tree]] and [[World Axis]] cosmologies, where Nishrek was its own realm (a twisted natural landscape marred by carnage and warped to fit orc ideals), Bahgtru dwelt within Gruumsh's [[Iron Fortress]].

==Relationships==
The other gods of the orc pantheon feared Bahgtru for his might, but the Leg-Breaker was generally obedient and they called upon him whenever they needed his assistance.{{Cite dragon/62/The Gods of the Orcs|26-27}} raising questions about the conflicting myths regarding Gruumsh's singular eye (orc legends said he always had one eye while elven myths said that [[Corellon]] pierced it).

Gruumsh's other war lieutenant, [[Ilneval]], secretly resented Bahgtru, Gruumsh, rightly, didn't trust the self-serving, ambitious Ilneval, but the War-Maker would stay loyal enough so long as Bahgtru was by his side, relieving some of his concerns.

Perhaps the only thing able to cause such a situation was Gruumsh's wife and Bahgtru's mother, Luthic. Luthic was one of the few beings able to bend both Gruumsh's and Bahgtru's ears, with Bahgtru always paying her words heed, and she was cunning enough to manipulate the two of them to often get her way. Gruumsh and Luthic were the only powers Bahgtru trusted, and he did so completely. However, if forced to choose between the commands of his mother or father, Bahgtru would undoubtedly follow his mother's wishes, for he was even closer to her than he was to Gruumsh. The One-Eyed God tolerated this minor rebellion only grudgingly.

Bahgtru was too dim-witted to have complex rivalries with other deities, but he did have his adversaries. Bahgtru opposed the most obvious schemes of deities of deception, such as [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], [[Cyric]], and [[Mask]].

Bahgtru was implacably against the [[goblinoid pantheon]], but only attacked them if given permission by his father; He also despised the [[Seldarine]] and other sylvan deities for their physical weakness. The Leg-Breaker respected the strength of the [[dwarven gods]], but still wished to crush their skulls,

===Others===
Bahgtru's [[proxy]] was an orc called [[Moragrek]], a simple ruler of the Broken Skull clan that knew his command lasted only as long his strength. He did everything he could to keep an iron grip on power and was strong enough to keep hold for a fair amount of time, enjoying the act of ensuring that not many orcs could survive trying to pull their way out of the trenches of his domain.

Legend said that Bahgtru needed a mount with ferocity to match his own, and so sought out a mighty [[aurochs]] to ride into war. After subjugating it with his bare hands and bringing it to Nishrek, he creatively dubbed the creature Kazaht, meaning "Bull" in [[Orc language|orc]]. On the unsaddled back of his steed, he would ram through the enemy host and leap over its horns to land in the midst of his enemies.

==Worshipers==
Bahgtru was the god of common orc warriors, His clergy was often composed of the tribe's strongest members, and [[cleric]]s of the Fist of Gruumsh had to keep themselves strong and physically fit, else lose their abilities. Such orcs would have their spirits crushed by Bahgtru's fists in the afterlife, and stronger clerics had permission to help weaker clerics to the great beyond, usually without the consent of the latter.

Like scavengers behind a [[shark]], followers collected in Bahgtru's path of destruction seeking to use his destruction to their benefit. Those who acted in the Leg-Breaker's name sought to break through clever trickery and adamant defense through raw power, with ogres and other brutes paying homage to his sheer strength.

===Dogma===
[[File:Bahgtru symbol.jpg|thumb|''The [[unholy symbol]] of Bahgtru, a broken thighbone.'']]
The dogma of Bahgtru was that of power and tribe loyalty; the strong were to crush the weak in order to strengthen the tribe. They had to continually try to prove their superior strength and endurance through cruel competitions against tribe members, unprovoked aggression, and battle prowess, to show they were worthy of Gruumsh's gaze. They were also not to be particularly intelligent, with ignorance being an actual requirement, for craftiness undermined the tribe's strength. All that was needed from them was brawn and obedience.

Warriors that revered Bahgtru sometimes kept stables of war [[bull]]s and rode atop the large, [[ox]]-like aurochs due to legends about Bahgtru riding a great bull into battle. By doing so they honored both him and the creatures, which were trained to be fierce mounts from a young age. To all orcs, aurochs were sacred symbols of their god imbued with his spirit, not to be harmed or eaten and treated as honored warriors upon death.

===Rituals===
Clerics and [[adept]]s of Bahgtru prayed for their spells at dusk, when the Leg-Breaker "tore the sun from the sky". Every full moon, the Bahgtrun devoted gathered for a Festival of Strength, when many challenges of physical ability were held, some of which were lethal so as for the inevitable winnowing of the weak. Other holy days for the Fist of Gruumsh were before and after battles, where the bones of enemies were sacrificed on the battlefield.

==History==
Though he was the son of Gruumsh and Luthic,

==Rumors and Legends==
Bahgtru was often a character in a legend regarding [[Garl Glittergold]], the [[gnome]] deity, and the [[kobold]] god [[Kurtulmak]]. In the story, Garl had been seemingly bound by Kurtulmak and forced to listen to his repetitive threats before the gnome god told him a ludicrous tale. Other deities were sometimes used in place of Bahgtru, but usually the Fist of Gruumsh was the subject due to Kurtulmak's disagreements with the One-Eyed God's son. After making Kurtulmak laugh through his retelling of Bahgtru's frustrated tantrums after being tricked, Garl revealed he had never been properly bound and managed to bring the whole cave down before quickly [[plane shift]]ing away.

===Leg-Breaker===
According to legend, Bahgtru received his symbol and title of "Leg-Breaker" when he was ambushed by a tremendous, reptilian monster of otherworldly origins while out on a hunt. In a flash, Bahgtru found himself coiled by the length and constrained by the grip of the first behir, the mightiest of its kind with hundreds of legs. No one had ever escaped the creature's grasp, and so Bahgtru laughed at his luck, for such a beast would be the ultimate test of his strength.

In an epic battle, he broke each of its legs one by one until he was freed from its clutches, its screams supposedly becoming the lightning of storms, slaying the beast with his bare hands. Bahgtru's broken bone symbol was that of the behir's femurs, a reminder to his followers that anything could be broken and bested through superior strength.
