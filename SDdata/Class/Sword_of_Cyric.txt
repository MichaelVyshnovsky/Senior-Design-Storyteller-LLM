A sword was a specialty priest of the Church of Cyric who was tasked with spreading strife, disaster, and deception throughout Faer√ªn.
Cyrics swords were militant priests who openly battled the clergy of other deities. A sword would usually attack anyone wearing the holy symbol of a good-natured god. The swords personality determined whether that action would be an outright attack, or something with a little more subterfuge.
Swords were always tense as if waiting for a reason to kill someone around them, which always stood a chance of happening.
Swords were quite adept and moving about silently and using shadows to conceal their location. They were also skilled in the art of backstabbing. The hatred experienced when a sword viewed another gods holy symbol translated well during combat, making it slightly easier for them to strike and harm their opponents.
Swords were openly despised in Zhentil Keep and throughout the Moonsea, Dalelands, and Cormyr. Swords could not cast spells from the healing sphere, nor could they turn or command undead.
Given their frequent martial conflicts, swords were always wearing either chainmail, scale armor, or plate mail with a purple tabard. They wielded longswords or daggers during combat.
