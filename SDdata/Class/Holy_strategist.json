        "mainbody": "'''Holy strategists''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to the [[Red Knight]], the Lady of Strategy.",
        "Activities": "A holy strategist's life revolved around warfare. They often served as respected military commanders or instructors at war colleges.",
        "Abilities": "These speciality priests excelled when using [[spell]]s from the [[war sphere]] and [[travelers sphere]]. The effects of spells cast from these spheres were doubled. They also found it easier to see through illusions.\n\nThey gained a number of abilities as they progressed through the ranks including ''[[clairaudience/clairvoyance]]'', ''[[Divination (spell)|divination]]'', ''[[consequence]]'', ''[[hallucinatory terrain]]'', and ''[[mass invisibility]]''. These powers could be used once per day.\n\nThey could cast [[wizard]] spells when using [[scroll]]s.\n\nA holy strategist's familiarity with weaponry allowed them to execute more attacks during combat than a typical priest. They nearly rivaled a [[fighter]] in their proficient use of weapons.",
        "Possessions": "Holy strategists could carry any weapon they desired for combat. They were not restricted in the type of [[armor]] they wore, but most preferred [[plate mail]], [[field plate]], or full [[plate armor]].",
        "Relationships": "A holy strategist almost always rode an exquisite steed. Though their mount could certainly be a well-trained [[horse]], other options included [[pegasi]], [[griffon]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[tiger]]s, etc."
