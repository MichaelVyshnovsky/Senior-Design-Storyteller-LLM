        "mainbody": "'''Doomscribes''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Jergal]], the Lord of the End of Everything.",
        "Activities": "Only a small number of doomscribes existed and they never went adventuring unless at Jergal's behest. They were experts in both [[necrology]] and the netherworld. When each doomscribe died Jergal determined whether or not they would continue to serve him in undeath as either a [[mummy]] or [[greater mummy]].",
        "Abilities": "When attempting to either [[turn undead|turn]] or [[command undead]], a doomscribe could double the number of [[undead]] affected. This power could be used three times per day. A doomscibe's intimate knowledge of necrology allowed them to easily identify the various forms of undead, allowing them target their specific weaknesses during combat. Their knowledge of the [[plane]]s provided a similar benefit when facing [[baatezu]] and [[tanar'ri]]. \n\nAll [[spell]]s cast by a doomscribe from either the [[law sphere]] or [[time sphere]] were twice as strong as normal in all aspects. Their connection with Jergal granted them resistance to energy draining attacks.\n\nDoomscribes could cast the following spells on a daily basis depending on their skill: ''[[feign death]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', ''[[mummy touch]]'', ''[[skull watch]]'', ''[[undead ward]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', and ''[[energy drain]]''. They could also cast ''[[age creature]]'' twice per day, and ''[[enervation]]'' three times per day.",
        "Possessions": "Doomscribes could wear any type of [[armor]] available to them and could wield the bludgeoning weapon of their choice in combat."
