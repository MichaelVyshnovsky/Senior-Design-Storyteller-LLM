        "Description": "Kossuth appeared as a red-hot column of awesome flame more than {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} high and {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. His voice could be heard for hundreds of yards in every direction, a hissing whisper mixed with disturbing crackling and popping.",
        "Relationships": "The supremely powerful elemental being known as Kossuth had lorded over fire since the earliest moments of the multiverse, though whether or not the contemporary Kossuth was the same primordial being or one in a long line of similarly named successors is a matter of much conjecture.  The Lord of Flames rarely intervened in affairs in the mortal world, spending most of his time embroiled in the intrigues of the [[Inner Planes]].\n\nKossuth's doctrine of elemental supremacy virtually assured conflict with the other elemental lords. Kossuth was vehemently opposed to [[Istishia]] and his clergy.",
        "Divine Realm": "Kossuth dwelled in the Crimson Pillar, a {{SIAdj|10|mile|k|long=yes|adj=wide}} globe made of the primordial power of fire that floated over the Sea of Fire on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. It was said that the blue-white flames of the Pillar gave off a heat that made the rest of the plane seem chilly in comparison.",

They rigidly ordered their members' studies and behaviors and put their focus on the purifying aspect of their deity.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}}\n* [[Disciples of the Salamander]]: The evil branch of the three. They saw fire as necessary for the renewal aspect of their deity, though some members' view on destruction bordered on [[Talos]]'s.\n* [[Brothers and Sisters of the Purifying Flame]]: The neutral branch of the three. Their goal was to strike a balance between purification and destruction and acted as the go-betweens of the other two monasteries.\nKossuth's monks could learn to become [[cleric]]s of the Firelord without sacrificing their potential as monks.",
            "Worship in Zakhara": "On the continent of [[Zakhara]], Kossuth was called one of the \"[[Zakharan pantheon#The cold gods of the elements|cold gods of the elements]]\". They were \"cold\" because those were seen as uncaring for human affairs and opposed to the Land of Fate's pervasive culture of [[Enlightenment]]. Only a few [[Zakharans]] were willing to worship a cold god in order to gain power.<ref>",

        "History": {
            "Early History": "In the {{YearlinkName|-150}}, powerful [[Raumathar]]an [[wizard]]s managed to summon Kossuth from his elemental home and instructed him to destroy a besieging army of hated [[Narfell]]. This he did, but he soon turned against the wizards, incinerating their city for their arrogance. The resulting conflagration consumed much of the northern coast of the [[Alamber Sea]], and the fires of Kossuth's anger burned strong for more than a decade after his withdrawal from Toril.\n\nKossuth appeared in the Realms once again in the {{YearlinkName|801}}, to assist some of his faithful with the destruction of a [[giant octopus|colossal octopus]].",
            "Modern History": "Kossuth was credited by his faithful with limiting the disastrous [[Salamander War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}} in [[Thay]]. Without his influence, they say, the War would have turned into an even greater debacle.\n\nKossuth was not among the deities sighted in [[Faer√ªn]] during the exile of the gods by [[Ao]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}."
