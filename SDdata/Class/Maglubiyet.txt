Maglubiyet (), known as The Mighty One or The High Chieftain was the chief deity of goblins, hobgoblins, and Dekanter goblins, as well as an exarch of Bane. He was a god of war and leadership who ruled over all the goblinoid deities with an iron fist. As a god of war and a great general he was also known as The Battle Lord.
Maglubiyet appeared as an  tall goblin with black skin and flaming eyes, with strong arms ending in sharp talons.
Maglubiyets divine realm was Clangor, located in Avalas, the first layer of the plane of Acheron. The mightiest goblin city in Clangor was Shetring, a fortification with five bridges spanning the River Lorfang. Maglubiyet lived at the bottom of a waterfall of the river in a cavern of magnificently carved steel dripping with moisture.
From his throne of flaming iron, Maglubiyet commanded the souls of goblins, hobgoblins, and worgs to wage eternal war against the orcish petitioners of Gruumsh. He also employed baatezu to bolster his armies.
Maglubiyet allowed the gods Khurgorbaeyag and Nomog-Geaya to live in his realm, if only just to keep an eye on them.
Maglubiyet was served by Khurgorbaeyag, goblin god of slavery, oppression, and morale, and Bargrivyek, the god of co-operation and territory among the goblins. Nomog-Geaya, patron deity of the hobgoblins, also paid fealty to Maglubiyet.
Maglubiyet was an unpopular deity with many gods, including those of the elves, dwarves, orcs, and others.
The priests and shamans of Maglubiyet were his mouthpieces on the Material Plane. They fulfilled his demands for blood sacrifices by dispatching victims with an axe. They believed that these sacrifices strengthened Maglubiyet.
Maglubiyet communed with his priests through omens. Blood flowing from the edge of an axe, abnormal behavior in worgs and wolves, and speaking directly through shamans in a trance were all ways he made his will known.
Maglubiyets holy day was the new moon
