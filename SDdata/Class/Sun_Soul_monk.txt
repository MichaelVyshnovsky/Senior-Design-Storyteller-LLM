'''Sun Soul monks''' were [[monk]]s and other members of the [[Order of the Sun Soul]] who followed the discipline known as the '''Way of the Sun Soul'''.

==Abilities==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Sun Soul monks progressing in their studies acquired several unique abilities, such as, the ability to radiate magical light from their bodies and clothes; a means of channeling their inner light into unarmed attacks, turning their hands into flaming weapons, the emission of dazzling beams of light.

In the 15{{th}} century DR, as monks progressed in their studies of the Way of the Sun Soul, they gained various abilities that included reproducing the effect of certain [[spell]]s, such as: ''[[radiant sun bolt]]'', ''[[searing sunburst]]'', ''[[sun shield]]'', ''[[mastery of death]]'', and ''[[burning hands|searing arc strike]]''.
