Finders were specialty priests devoted to Finder Wyvernspur, the Nameless Bard.
Only halflings and saurials could be finders.
Finders could cast the following spells once per dayâ€”charm person, find the path, Melisanders harp, and starharp. Ghost pipes, dispel silence, and slow rot could be cast twice per day.
Finders could train with any weapon but the heaviest armor they could wear was chainmail. They never carried a shield.
