Their passion burned with a severity that raged in comparison to others of their kind.\nWhile flames left others scarred or even turned to cinder, they nourished the spirits of wildfire genasi. Flame itself could heal their body even when they were struck with incapacitating wounds.\nWildfire genasi could produce fire when taking the smallest of actions in battle. After honing their powers they could shield others from harmful flames, or produce a fiery aura that surrounded them at all times.\nThese genasi were able to harness flames that were intense as those found in the Nine Hells and lash them at their enemies.\nThe most powerful wildfire genasi could harness a truly terrible power. They could ignite the blood within another living being, burning them from the inside out."
