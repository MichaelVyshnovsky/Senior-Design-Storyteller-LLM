'''Gorellik''' was the [[gnoll]] deity prior to the rise of the [[demon prince]] [[Yeenoghu]]. Gorellik fell out of favor among gnolls after Yeenoghu rose to prominence, though he was already in great decline before this.

==Description==
Gorellik's one and only avatar appeared as either a tall gnoll with mange or as a hyaenodon with blotchy white fur.

==Personality==
Gorellik became more savage and feral as his power declined.

==Abilities==
Every few years at random intervals, he could travel between the [[planes]]. Any gnoll that encountered him on the planes (''i.e.'', got within his tiny spherical realm) was immediately transformed into a [[hyaenodon]] and joined his hunting pack, unless they were a gnoll priest or [[shaman]] of some other deity. He could also charm any canine, but only twice a day.

==Divine Realm==
After his long decline, his realm was limited to about a 100 yd (91 m) radius around his person.

==Activities==
In his relative weakness, Gorellik spent most of his time prowling [[Pandemonium]] and [[the Abyss]] in his avatar form.

==Relationships==
Gorellik had no allies and his primary rival was Yeenoghu.

==History==
Long ago, Gorellik was the one who originally taught gnolls how to train [[hyena]]s for use in hunting. Gorellik had the status of a [[lesser deity]] and was perhaps even a higher power, but his followers respected only force and they gradually turned toward the evil side of the [[giant pantheon]]. Early gnoll myths did not tell of a creation story for their race so Gorellik could not even claim this familial tie to bind the gnolls to him. Then [[Yeenoghu]], an interloper demon lord that inserted himself with the giants (and made his avatar giant-sized) was able to grab attention from the rudderless gnolls and his power increased as Gorellik's faded away.

In modern history, Gorellik was worshiped by the gnoll tribes of the [[Shaar]], but saw a sharp decline in the [[640 DR|Year of the Fanged Beast, 640 DR]], as Yeenoghu surged in popularity and emboldened the tribes to attack the region around [[Lake Lhespen]] with their newly acquired shamanistic power.

Less than a millennium later, Yeenoghu's purview over the gnolls was, for all practical purposes, complete.{{Cite dragon/364/Demonomicon of Iggwilv|10}}<ref group="note">The [[Demonomicon of Iggwilv (column)|Demonomicon of Iggwilv]] article states that Yeenoghu slaughtered Gorellik during [[Dawn War|the conflict]] between the [[gods]] and the [[primordials]] in prehistoric times. This could be the victors writing the history, because Gorellik still had a smattering of followers and was known in modern times. Perhaps he was just slowly dying from his wounds.
