Specialty priests of Arvoreen were worshipers of Arvoreen, the Defender, within Luiren in the Shining South.
These individuals were always halflings.
These specialty priests could imbue a single target with incredible strength once per day. As their powers grew they could imbue the strength to more targets to a maximum of three per day. They could turn undead like normal priests. Many were also skilled warriors.
They did not have weapon restrictions and trained with the short sword first. The heaviest armor they were permitted to wear was chainmail and they did not carry a shield.
