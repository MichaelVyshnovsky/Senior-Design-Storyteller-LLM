The '''Arcana domain''' was a deity [[domain]] that granted [[divine]] spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and powers related to [[arcane magic]] and lore.

==Deities==
{{ListDeitiesByDomain|{{PAGENAME}}}}

==Powers==
The priest with this domain had proficiency or greater skill pertaining to matters of the arcane.

After the [[Spellplague]], they treated certain divine prayers as arcane magic, namely ''[[lance of faith]]'' (for clerics), ''[[divine bolts]]'' (for [[Divine soul|invokers]]), ''[[radiant vengeance]]'' (for [[avenger]]s), and ''[[virtuous strike]]'' (for [[paladin]]s) and could aim arcane spells better afterward.

==Spells==
After the [[Second Sundering]], clerics who chose this domain could learn two [[wizard]]ly [[cantrip]]s. They were granted free access to the spells ''[[detect magic]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]'' initially; then [[Magic weapon (spell)|''magic weapon'']], ''[[Nystul's magic aura]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', and ''[[magic circle]]'' at moderate experience; and ''[[arcane eye]]'', ''[[Leomund's secret chest]]'', ''[[planar binding]]'', and ''[[teleportation circle]]'' at the highest levels of power.

==Channel Divinity==
After the Spellplague, they could [[channel divinity]] to use ''[[arcana ward]]'', which shielded against elemental forces.

After the Second Sundering, they could instead use ''[[arcane abjuration]]'' to turn away otherworldly beings.
