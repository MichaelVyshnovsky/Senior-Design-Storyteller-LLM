        "Possessions": "Most woodwives wore [[padded armor]] and carried a wooden [[shield]]. They wielded a variety of weapons depending on their personal preference including [[club]]s, [[sickle]]s, [[dart]]s, [[sling]]s, [[spear]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[quarterstaves]], and [[net]]s. Woodwives also carried a strange [[magic item]] called a ''[[korred rope]]'' made from their own hair."
