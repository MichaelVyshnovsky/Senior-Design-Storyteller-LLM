'''Commoners''' were average folk who made up the bulk of [[Toril]]'s people. Commoners were responsible for farming the fields, staffing the shops, and performing most of the labor and production in their societies. They usually had no taste for risk like [[adventurer]]s, and were quite happy to avoid such nonsense.

Cruel lords who sought to mistreat and oppress their people would find that the common folk had a sharp limit to their tolerance—and [[serf]]s and [[slave]]s had even less. Even if only armed with [[knives]] and [[club]]s, a sufficiently angered population of commoners could overthrow a kingdom.

|Perhaps the only sight more fearful than a rampaging [[dragon]] is a rampaging crowd of villagers. A town united against a menacing monster and armed with the simple (but deadly) tools of common laborers can cow even the most savage army of foes. And of course, on a daily basis these same peasant heroes turn their tools to the mundane but no-less necessary task of sowing and reaping, chiseling and joining—the constant and wearying work that makes our world.
