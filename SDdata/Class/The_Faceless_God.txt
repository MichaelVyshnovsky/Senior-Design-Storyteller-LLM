The '''Forgotten God''' or the '''Faceless God''' was the mysterious [[Zakharan pantheon#Savage gods|savage deity]] that watched over the empire of the evil [[Yikaria|yak-men]] in the [[World Pillar Mountains]] in [[Zakhara]]'s [[Northeast Zakhara|northeast]].{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

Its name was known by his followers only. It was called "the Forgotten God" or "the Faceless God" by outsiders, because it appeared like a giant yak-man in flowing robes, but without a face. Some believed that the yak-men were the offspring of the Faceless God. It was also believed that the deity thrived in general upon the success of the yikaria in building an empire that stretched out its feelers into the rest of Zakhara, and in particular upon gruesome sacrifices brought to him by his people. The god was also known to personally appoint the [[Seven Sages|rulers of the provinces]] of the [[Yikarian Empire]], and its [[Lotus Emperor]].
