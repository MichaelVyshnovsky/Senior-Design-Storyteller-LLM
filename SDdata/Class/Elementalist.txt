An '''elementalist''' was a type of [[wizard]] who specialized in spells dealing with the [[Elemental Planes|four elements]]. The school of effect, elementalism, touched all [[Schools of Magic|schools of magic]]. These four elements were opposed, with Fire and Water being opposed, and Air and Earth being opposed.

==Benefits==
Unlike most wizards, elementalists learned [[spell]]s from their schools far faster, and those of the other two schools only slightly faster, and they could memorize more spells of their element. Their spells were also more potent and harder to dodge, and they could memorize spells at a higher level. They also did not need to concentrate on spells of their element and could research the spells of their element sooner than most.

==Hindrances==
Elementalists learned [[Universal spell]]s far slower and could not learn spells of the opposite element at all.
