'''Alaghor''' were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], the Father of Battle.

==Culture==
The vast majority of alaghor were either [[gold dwarves]] or [[shield dwarves]], but members of all of the [[dwarf]] races, both males and females, could become an alaghar.

==Abilities==
Alaghar possessed superior skills with weapons, similar to warriors. They practiced their weapons skills frequently, allowing them to strike more often during combat. An alaghar could pour all of their energy into a devastating swing of their weapon once per day.

In addition to their normal [[spell]]s, alaghar could cast ''[[command]]'', ''[[spiritual hammer]]'', ''[[strength]]'', ''[[strength of one]]'', ''[[defensive harmony]]'', ''[[axe storm of Clangeddin]]'', and ''[[blade barrier]]'' on a daily basis. They could also ''[[detect magic]]'' at will.

==Possessions==
Alaghor did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield nor the [[armor]] they could wear. Many favored the [[battle axe]].
