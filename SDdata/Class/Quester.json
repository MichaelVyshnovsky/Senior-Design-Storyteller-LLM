        "mainbody": "Questers were specialty priests of the Church of Helm who were tasked by He of the Unsleeping Eyes to retrieve lost items and rescue kidnapped people.\nThese individuals spent all of their time striving to complete their current objectives.\nQuesters were completely focused on their quests to rescue kidnapped victims or retrieve lost items. Anything or anyone standing in their way of achieving these goals was dealt with swiftly.\nQuesters were very skilled at casting spells from both the guardian sphere and protection spheres. Their version of the locate object spell lasted for a full 24 hours.\nThey could not cast any spells from the animal or plant spheres.\nQuester wore full plate mail with an open-faced helm adorned with a gold plume. Most also covered their armor with a gold tabard emblazoned with the eye of Helm centered on the chest. A quester could wield any weapon of their choice, but many favored the two-handed sword.\nDue to Helms role during the Time of Troubles in barring the gods from accessing the Celestial Staircases and slaying Mystra, Questers were not held in high regard in the northern Heartlands."
