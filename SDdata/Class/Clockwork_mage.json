Many commoners thought of them as little more than toy-makers. Some mechanicians even encouraged this view in order to hide their true work.\nThese mages could use normal weapons like other wizards, but they were also adept with using hammers. They never wore armor.\nClockwork mages were able to construct machines called clockwork devices that were imbued with spell-like powers. The limit of the kind of machines they built, and their function, was up to the clockwork mages imagination, available time, and monetary funding.\nMechanicians could not cast spells like other wizards."
