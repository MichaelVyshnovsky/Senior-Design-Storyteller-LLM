        "mainbody": "A '''cat burglar''' was a [[rogue]] trained in advanced acrobatic and athletic techniques. Masters of evasion and daring athletes, and capable of remarkable feats of skill and agility, cat burglars could surprise their opponents with their feats.",
        "Abilities": "A cat burglar enhanced their ability to control their physical momentum, darting from one place to another rapidly as well as enabling them to lessen the effect others' could have upon their movement. With further training, cat burglars became more adept still, becoming true masters of the athletic arts, climbing, jumping, and swimming with an unusual degree of aptitude.\n\nThe [[exploit]]s of a cat burglar likewise focused upon maintaining mobility throughout combat. With a speedy but risky gambit, they could move swiftly and strike just as quickly. They could make an instant escape from any kind of restraint with great effort. The greatest cat burglars could avoid incoming strikes and redirect them to that a nearby enemy took the blow instead."
