The '''Way of the Open Hand''', and commonly called simply '''kung fu''', was a branch of martial arts and a discipline followed by various monastic orders of [[Faerûn]] It was based around the use of martial arts and [[ki]] for defensive and healing purposes, but was the monastic tradition most dedicated to martial arts mastery.

==History==
The core martial art first originated among the [[Shou]] people of [[Shou Lung]], From these, a myriad of martial arts termed "kung fu" became common across Shou Lung. These kung fu styles were favored by the Shou and many knew a little of one style or another.

Three early masters of the Open Hand were the [[Ren Brothers]], who developed its martial arts techniques into tools for attaining immortality. They compiled their experiences and secrets in ''[[The Book of Inner Alchemy]]'', but feared the chaos it would cause in the world. Thus they hid it away in the [[Candlekeep]] library.

==Description==
The Way of the Open Hand was not a single martial art, but a whole family of unarmed martial arts styles. There were thousands of such styles, all with their own names and techniques but sharing its overall concept. Despite the name, it was applicable to both armed and unarmed combat.

==Techniques==

As the name suggested, these kung fu styles focused on attacking with the hands. There were a number of hard and soft maneuvers a practitioner could learn. Techniques could include iron fists to strike with additional force and crushing blows to damage objects; a flying kick to leap into combat; and locks such as choke holds, locking blocks, and grips that incapacitated body parts. These struck at lines of nerves known as meridians to debilitate foes. Some practitioners could also learn to deflect incoming missiles such as [[arrow]]s if aware of them, while others trained to harden their muscles as strong as [[iron]], known as "ironskin".

Open Hand techniques also enabled a [[monk]] to trip a foe, push them back to a distance of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}}, or otherwise prevent them from acting effectively. These were achieved by the practitioner harnessing their own ki while manipulating that of their foe.

The highest-ranked masters of this tradition learned the technique of the "quivering palm". This unarmed strike used their ki to trigger unnoticeable vibrations within a foe's body, lasting up to seventeen days or more. Within this time, whenever the monk willed it, these vibrations turned lethal, seriously harming or even killing them. They could also choose to dismiss it harmlessly. The monk could have one quivering palm effect active at a time.

==Abilities==
Advanced monks of the Open Hand were able to heal themselves of some injuries, in a technique known as "wholeness of body". They could do this once a day or before a lengthy rest.

Very advanced monks could meditate to achieve a state of tranquility and an aura of peace, giving them a benefit similar to a ''[[sanctuary]]'' spell the next day.

==Activities==
Masters of the Way of Open Hand fought frequently to advance and champion their particular styles, such as by holding contests within and between rival schools.

==Notable Practitioners==
* The [[Ren Brothers]], three early masters and writers of ''The Book of Inner Alchemy''
* [[Bak Mei]], an apostate monk of the late 1400s [[DR]].<ref>

* The [[Strong Claw Order]]'s [[bear]] style, focusing on strength and slashing motions;

* The [[Order of the White Crane]]'s White Crane style, renowned for grace and swiftness;
* The [[Order of the Dragon]]'s Dragon form;
* [[Dragonfly style]], with which masters achieve incredible speed and even levitation;<ref><ref>
* [[Four Keys]], a well-known and respected style emphasizing the four "keys" of aim, balance, speed, and strength in equal measure;<ref>
* [[Iron Hand School]], focusing on hardening the body, considered one of the best styles of Shou Lung;
* [[Five Stars School]], named for five kinds of movement—speed, leaping, missile deflection, and feinting—with flurries of blows and slowing time itself, and popular with women;
* [[Northern Fist School]], focusing on reading ki and striking vital areas;
* [[Southern Star School]], focusing on applying ki as a precise weapon;

In Faerûn, practices similar to the Way of the Open Hand were followed by the [[Ilmatari]] monks of the [[Order of the Yellow Rose]] and the [[halfling]] monks of the [[Hin Fist]].
