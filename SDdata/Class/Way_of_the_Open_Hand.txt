The Way of the Open Hand, and commonly called simply kung fu, was a branch of martial arts and a discipline followed by various monastic orders of Faerûn It was based around the use of martial arts and ki for defensive and healing purposes, but was the monastic tradition most dedicated to martial arts mastery.
The core martial art first originated among the Shou people of Shou Lung, From these, a myriad of martial arts termed "kung fu" became common across Shou Lung. These kung fu styles were favored by the Shou and many knew a little of one style or another.
Three early masters of the Open Hand were the Ren Brothers, who developed its martial arts techniques into tools for attaining immortality. They compiled their experiences and secrets in The Book of Inner Alchemy, but feared the chaos it would cause in the world. Thus they hid it away in the Candlekeep library.
The Way of the Open Hand was not a single martial art, but a whole family of unarmed martial arts styles. There were thousands of such styles, all with their own names and techniques but sharing its overall concept. Despite the name, it was applicable to both armed and unarmed combat.
As the name suggested, these kung fu styles focused on attacking with the hands. There were a number of hard and soft maneuvers a practitioner could learn. Techniques could include iron fists to strike with additional force and crushing blows to damage objects a flying kick to leap into combat and locks such as choke holds, locking blocks, and grips that incapacitated body parts. These struck at lines of nerves known as meridians to debilitate foes. Some practitioners could also learn to deflect incoming missiles such as arrows if aware of them, while others trained to harden their muscles as strong as iron, known as "ironskin".
Open Hand techniques also enabled a monk to trip a foe, push them back to a distance of , or otherwise prevent them from acting effectively. These were achieved by the practitioner harnessing their own ki while manipulating that of their foe.
The highest-ranked masters of this tradition learned the technique of the "quivering palm". This unarmed strike used their ki to trigger unnoticeable vibrations within a foes body, lasting up to seventeen days or more. Within this time, whenever the monk willed it, these vibrations turned lethal, seriously harming or even killing them. They could also choose to dismiss it harmlessly. The monk could have one quivering palm effect active at a time.
Advanced monks of the Open Hand were able to heal themselves of some injuries, in a technique known as "wholeness of body". They could do this once a day or before a lengthy rest.
Very advanced monks could meditate to achieve a state of tranquility and an aura of peace, giving them a benefit similar to a sanctuary spell the next day.
Masters of the Way of Open Hand fought frequently to advance and champion their particular styles, such as by holding contests within and between rival schools.
