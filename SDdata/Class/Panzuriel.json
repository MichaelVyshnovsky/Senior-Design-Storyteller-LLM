        "mainbody": "'''Panzuriel''' was an old and evil sea god.",
        "Description": "Panzuriel appeared as a old, hunched-over humanoid male with gills and scaly skin that was green on the ventral side and yellow on the dorsal side. He had shining green eyes and taloned hands, and dragged his left leg behind him when he walked, for that leg ended in a crystal foot rather than one of flesh. He wore tattered black robes and carried a staff on which he leant heavily.",
        "Personality": "Panzuriel was a vile, hateful deity who was greatly bitter and angered over his banishment from the Material plane. He especially hated sea elves, most particularly [[Deep Sashelas]]. Despite his anger, however, he was calculating in his planning.",
        "Abilities": "Panzuriel's avatar was limited in that if one was destroyed on the Material plane, it would take 20 years to reform. Thus, he mostly relied on his priests and shamans to do his bidding.\n\nHis avatar was capable of casting spells from all the spheres he gave his priests access too, as well as the [[Thought sphere]]. He could turn into a {{SIAdj|10|ft}} giant octopus at will, summon up to three kraken once each day, use ''[[continual darkness]]'' and ''[[darkness 30' radius]]'' at will, create a mud/coral storm thrice each day, and cast ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', and ''[[cause confusion]]'' thrice each day. He also had infravision out to {{SI|200|ft}} even in magical darkness.\n\nHowever, he had some severe weaknesses in that he had to keep part of his body on the seafloor at all times and could not enter waters shallower than {{SI|50|ft}}; he could not be compelled into shallow waters but being removed from the seafloor harmed him. He was weak against all spells of the Sun sphere, against the arcane spells ''light'', ''continual light'', and the like, as well as any bright spells such as ''lightning bolt'' and ''chain lightning''.",
        "Possessions": "Panzuriel's crystal foot was akin to a powerfully enchanted weapon, and he carried an enchanted, slightly electrically charged [[quarterstaff]].",
        "Divine Realm": "Panzuriel was confined to a reeking, fetid, briny pool called Rezuriel in [[Niflheim]].",
        "Activities": "He spent most of his time plotting his revenge, seeking to slay sea elves and other servitors of good aquatic deities, and most especially planning on how to torture and kill Deep Sashelas.",
        "Relationships": "He loathed the various good aquatic deities, in particular Deep Sashelas.\n\nAlthough Panzuriel was worshiped on Toril, [[Umberlee]] had long ago usurped his name, taking the worshipers for herself and granting spells under his name.<ref>",
        "Worshipers": "Panzuriel was worshiped by [[scrag]]s, [[koalinth]], [[vodyanoi]], [[merrow]], [[sahuagin]], and [[kraken]]s, the last of whom were his favorites. For instance, he required his priests and shamans to leave any magical items they found in their depredations as sacrifices to him, except kraken priests, who could keep items they could use for themselves. He also only sent visions to krakens, normally of ships or communities to destroy.\n\nAdditionally, Panzuriel's priests had to establish lairs on the seafloor, attack anything that approached their lairs, and always attack and never retreat from sea elves.",
        "History": "Panzuriel had once been more powerful and prominent of a deity, but in prehistoric times a number of good gods opposed him. Eventually, he and Deep Sashelas fought; a battle in which Panzuriel's left foot was cut off by the sea-elf god as Panzuriel fled shrieking into the Abyss, banished from the Material plane. However, he eventually used his foot to reestablish a minor presence on the Material plane."
