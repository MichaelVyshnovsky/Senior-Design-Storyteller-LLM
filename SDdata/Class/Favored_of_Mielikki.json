        "mainbody": "A favored of Mielikki was a follower of the Forest Queen who was especially faithful to her cause and was blessed by her in turn.\nSuch folk had loved the wilds for the whole of their lives, from its grandest landscapes to its tiniest wonders. They felt an instant attraction to the faith of Mielikki, describing it as like reuniting with an old friend.\nThey worked hard to serve the goals of the Forest Queen, namely achieving harmony with nature, protecting the forest and the wider world, and upholding natural laws, while teaching their knowledge to others and inspiring them to follow their ways.\nThey needed to be good of heart and faithful followers of Mielikki.\nIn battle, thanks to Mielikkis good graces, the favored could aid their allies to act swiftly when needed. Moreover, they were not hindered by plant cover, shadow, or anything else that obscured sight when attacking a foe outside. They could more easily seriously harm both natural and unnatural creatures in Mielikkis judgement—beasts, plant creatures, and aberrant creatures—also daze those they did serious harm too.\nMielikki granted her favored a few magical powers based around plants and forest. They could conjure protective vines to ensnare and constrict their enemies, and thereby protect their allies, up to  away. They could glimpse and even use the magical pathways that only beings like dryads used to treestride, thus teleporting between any two large plants (or plant creatures) up to  once a day. Finally, they could call on the forest itself once a day to cause plant life to grow thick and green over an area up to  wide. It blocked sight, was difficult to traverse, and tripped, ensnared, and constricted enemies, while boosting the fighting prowess of allied beasts and plant creatures."
