        "mainbody": "'''Sess'innek'''<ref group=\"note\" name=\"spelling\">In ''Monster Mythology'', the demon lord is called \"Sess'innek\" eight times, \"Sess'inek\" once (in the table of contents), and \"Sess'Innek\" once (in the title of his entry, presumably an error in the use of title upper-case). In ''On Hallowed Ground'', his name is always spelled \"Sess'innek\" (in the index and on page 49). In ''Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss'', his name is spelled \"Sess'Innek\" once and \"Sess'inek\" once (both on page 156). In ''Planes of Chaos'', his name is spelled \"Sess'inek\" three times (once in the ''Book of Chaos,'' page 20, and twice on the poster map). In ''Serpent Kingdoms'', his name is spelled \"Sess'innek\" twenty times. was a [[tanar'ri]] [[demon lord]] worshiped by the [[lizardfolk]] as a deity of civilization and dominion. His symbol was a green, clawed, reptilian hand.",
        "Description": "Sess'innek took the form of a six-armed [[lizard king]] with vestigial greenish-brown wings. Each of his six hands wielded a longsword of potent magical power.",
        "Relationships": "Sess'innek kept himself apart from other [[demon lord]]s, sealing his layer from all intruders. The lizardfolk deity [[Semuanya]] counted him an enemy.<ref>",
        "Realm": "Sess'innek dwelt on the [[Layers_of_the_Abyss#Layers_1â€“100|seventh layer]] of the [[Abyss]], known as [[Kearackinin]], or the [[Phantom Plane]]. Furthermore, Sess'innek had sealed and \"locked\" the layer so it could not be accessed without his express permission. It was said that Sess'innek was tired of the [[Blood War]], and went into his self-imposed exile, in order to have nothing to do with the politics of the Abyss.\n\nThe Phantom Plane was only discovered when the wizard [[Mordenkainen]] managed to temporarily break the seals.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Clergy": "Sess'innek had few shamans, with the vast majority of them being lizard kings, the descendants of lizardfolk and [[demon]]s loyal to Sess'innek. Sess'innek required his shamans to be aggressive in spreading his faith, and to slay clerics of Semuanya on sight."
        },
        "Holy Days & Rituals": "Sess'innek demanded regular sacrifices in his name and little else. The khaasta sacrificed approximately one in ten prisoners to their demonic patron. Twice a week, lizard kings gathered late at night to tear the hearts from sentient beings and devour them amid prayers to Sess'innek.\n\nA ''[[weapon of the deity]]'' from Sess'innek produced a ''+1 [[Corrosive (weapon quality)|corrosive]] [[longsword]]''.",
        "History": "When [[Demogorgon]] freed his creations, the khaasta, that race of planar lizardkin began to gather under Sess'innek's banner.\n\nIn order to aid the khaasta in their war against the [[sarrukh]], Sess'innek sent demons to rally lizardfolk tribes to his banner. The lizard kings were the half-demonic descendants of those demons."
