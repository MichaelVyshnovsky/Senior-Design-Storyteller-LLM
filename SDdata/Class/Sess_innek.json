        "mainbody": "SessinnekIn Monster Mythology, the demon lord is called \"Sessinnek\" eight times, \"Sessinek\" once (in the table of contents), and \"SessInnek\" once (in the title of his entry, presumably an error in the use of title upper-case). In On Hallowed Ground, his name is always spelled \"Sessinnek\" (in the index and on page 49). In Fiendish Codex I Hordes of the Abyss, his name is spelled \"SessInnek\" once and \"Sessinek\" once (both on page 156). In Planes of Chaos, his name is spelled \"Sessinek\" three times (once in the Book of Chaos, page 20, and twice on the poster map). In Serpent Kingdoms, his name is spelled \"Sessinnek\" twenty times. was a tanarri demon lord worshiped by the lizardfolk as a deity of civilization and dominion. His symbol was a green, clawed, reptilian hand.\nSessinnek took the form of a six-armed lizard king with vestigial greenish-brown wings. Each of his six hands wielded a longsword of potent magical power.\nSessinnek kept himself apart from other demon lords, sealing his layer from all intruders. The lizardfolk deity Semuanya counted him an enemy.\nSessinnek dwelt on the seventh layer of the Abyss, known as Kearackinin, or the Phantom Plane. Furthermore, Sessinnek had sealed and \"locked\" the layer so it could not be accessed without his express permission. It was said that Sessinnek was tired of the Blood War, and went into his self-imposed exile, in order to have nothing to do with the politics of the Abyss.\nThe Phantom Plane was only discovered when the wizard Mordenkainen managed to temporarily break the seals.\nSessinnek was revered by both khaasta and the half-demonic lizard kings, and thus by extension their tribes. Such tribes generally had only a single lizard king ruler and those who failed to prove worthy of ruling were killed and sacrificed to Sessinnek. The exceptions were those that elected to become shamans instead of leaders although most were too prideful to take such a route. In addition, some tanarri priests were known to pledge themselves to his service.\nSessinnek had few shamans, with the vast majority of them being lizard kings, the descendants of lizardfolk and demons loyal to Sessinnek. Sessinnek required his shamans to be aggressive in spreading his faith, and to slay clerics of Semuanya on sight.\nSessinnek demanded regular sacrifices in his name and little else. The khaasta sacrificed approximately one in ten prisoners to their demonic patron. Twice a week, lizard kings gathered late at night to tear the hearts from sentient beings and devour them amid prayers to Sessinnek.\nA weapon of the deity from Sessinnek produced a +1 corrosive longsword.\nWhen Demogorgon freed his creations, the khaasta, that race of planar lizardkin began to gather under Sessinneks banner.\nIn order to aid the khaasta in their war against the sarrukh, Sessinnek sent demons to rally lizardfolk tribes to his banner. The lizard kings were the half-demonic descendants of those demons."
