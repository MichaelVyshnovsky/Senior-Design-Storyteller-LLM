Untamo was an outsider deity of sleep and dreams.
Untamo was very mild mannered in everything he did. He heavily disliked being disturbed, such as by being summoned, no matter what the reason. He would often punish those who dared to disturb him.
Untamo radiated an aura of sleep that would cause any creatures who had not recently slept for thirteen hours or more to instantly fall into a slumber when in his presence.
This deity typically fought with an enchanted club that could cause those struck by it to fall asleep.
Untamo resided within the plane of Concordant Opposition, otherwise known as the Outlands, in a realm known as the Sleeping Lands. He was rarely known to wander beyond his domain. Whoever entered his domain was said to instantly fall within Untamos dream and could only escape if he willed it.
His domain was adjacent to those of two other outsider deities, one of them being Yen-Wang-Yeh,
Any being that summoned Untamo had to pledge to serve him and his needs for an entire year in order to receive his aid in any matter. Those agree to his terms were usually granted the ability to cast the spell sleep four times per day.
In the kingdom of Bakar, a survivor state of the Imaskar Empire, a mighty city known as Medinat Muskawoon housed temples to gods of faiths that the populaces ancestors brought over from their original worlds. Among these temples was one dedicated to Untamo.
The priestly vestments of Untamos faith included a blue tunic.
