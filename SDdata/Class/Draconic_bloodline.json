I am destined for greatness.|[[Xandala]], demonstrating the arrogance of [[dragonkind]].}}",
        "Culture": "Most of these sorcerers had some distant relative that forged a bargain with a dragon, or had a trace of draconic lineage.\n\nDraconic bloodline sorcerers often learned to speak, read, and write the [[draconic language|language]] of dragons.",
        "Abilities": "Depending on the variety of dragon to which they were linked, whether [[chromatic dragon|chromatic]], [[metallic dragon|metallic]], or otherwise, these sorcerers possessed a certain fortitude that was uncommon among their fellow practitioners. They held an affinity for the specific element that was associated with that type of dragon, most often [[fire]], [[cold]], [[lightning]], [[poison]], or [[acid]]. They could readily protect themselves from that chosen element, and the spells they cast utilizing it were exceptionally potent.\n\nAs they grew in power, draconic bloodline sorcerers began to more resemble dragonkind. They gained the ability to grow draconic wings from their back and take upon themselves the terrifying aura of a dragon that instilled fear in lesser beings.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], draconic bloodline sorcerers were most prominent in the lands of [[Chessenta]] and [[Murghôm]], each of which had been ruled by dragons and kin for nearly a century or longer.",
        "Notable Draconic Bloodline Sorcerers": "* [[Xandala]], a sorcerer that famously traveled to [[Chult]] in search of the fabled ''[[Ring of Winter]]''."
