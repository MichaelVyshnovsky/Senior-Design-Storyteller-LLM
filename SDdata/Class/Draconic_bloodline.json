They held an affinity for the specific element that was associated with that type of dragon, most often fire, cold, lightning, poison, or acid. They could readily protect themselves from that chosen element, and the spells they cast utilizing it were exceptionally potent.\nAs they grew in power, draconic bloodline sorcerers began to more resemble dragonkind. They gained the ability to grow draconic wings from their back and take upon themselves the terrifying aura of a dragon that instilled fear in lesser beings.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, draconic bloodline sorcerers were most prominent in the lands of Chessenta and Murgh√¥m, each of which had been ruled by dragons and kin for nearly a century or longer.\n* Xandala, a sorcerer that famously traveled to Chult in search of the fabled Ring of Winter."
