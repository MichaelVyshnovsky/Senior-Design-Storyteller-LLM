        "mainbody": "Anatomists were a subtype of necromancer that specialized in a focus on the physical sciences, devoting themselves to the scientific study of bodies.\nThose who traversed this profession typically went down one of two developmental routes. Most went down this path to further dark motives, becoming either \"mad scientists\" that created horrid experiments or experts in torturing that were sometimes employed by despots. These horrible experiments could lead to the creation of various types of golems, such as flesh golems\nOut of all types of necromancers, anatomists were the ones most tied to civilization, as large towns and cities were the only places one could ensure a steady and safely procured supply of cadavers.\nAs some civilizations held taboos and stigmas with corpse dissection, anatomists often had to keep their experiments a secret. They would masquerade as \"ordinary\" doctors or non-necromancer wizards that had gained their knowledge from attending academic lectures or reading ancient text, rather than from first-hand experience.\nAbove all the fields of study, anatomists were always skilled in anatomy and healing, acquired over many years of extensive study, making them far better doctors than most village healers. Because of their expertise in anatomy they were also quite skilled at determining a corpses time and cause of death through performance of an autopsy.\nSome anatomists were also known to have skills in herbalism, venom handling, and various aspects of dealing with animals. Some were also skilled in the rogueish arts of disguise and forgery out of necessity to better mask their life as anatomists. They rarely ever showed interest in netherworld knowledge or the creation and control of undead, though sometimes found the latter useful for manual labor.\nIn terms of spells, anatomists preferred those of the necromancy school whose effects directly affected physical bodies, either prior to or following death, often using magic to aid or better inform their research. This included such spells as bone growth, corpse link, delay death, embalm, empathic wound transfer, and graft flesh. They often hesitated to employ offensive magics, as they might risk making a corpse unsuitable for later study.\nAnatomists were typically garbed in the mantle and robes of either a physician or scholar. They usually carried around their surgical tools, keeping them in a black leather bag or a small box. These surgical tools included such things as bonesaws, knives, retractors, and scalpels.\nDue to their surgical precision, they preferred fighting with small edged or cutting weapons, starting with a simple knife. Later on they would take to handling such weapons as daggers, darts, cutlasses, and short swords.\n* Danna the Skull, an anatomist that worked for the Forthright Band of Investigators.\n* Ellandra Tolbert, a famous Neveren anatomist. She was born to an equally famous anatomist father, whom she assisted with dissections in her youth, and she was a member of the Anatomical Academy."
