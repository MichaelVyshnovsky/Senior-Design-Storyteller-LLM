        "mainbody": "Halruaan magehounds were the inquisitors of Halruaa who enforced its paramount magic laws and regulated the use of magic therein. They answered only to the Council of Elders.\nMagehounds were responsible for some of the most important tasks involved in the regulation of Halruaan magic laws. Among these were testing the Jordaini caste for magical abilities, and hunting down renegade or criminal magic users.\nNo wizards were beyond their authority or reach, including the Council who oversaw their actions. Because of this authority, magehounds lived a solitary and lonely lifestyle, being feared and shunned by their arcane brethren. Despite this, magehounds would keep some associates with complimentary skills to assist in their hunts.\nMagehounds honed their skills to attain increased sensitivity towards arcane magic and protect themselves from its effects.\nThe most powerful from among their ranks were capable of developing antimagic fields, in order to help them contain rogue spellcasters.\n* Kiva"
