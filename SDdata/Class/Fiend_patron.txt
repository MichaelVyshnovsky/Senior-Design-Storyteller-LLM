A '''fiend patron''' was one possible sponsor for a [[warlock]]. If a bargain was made between a warlock and an [[archdevil]], a [[demon lord]], or some other member of the fiendish royalty, the warlock's patron gave them access to certain powers, including a suite of [[spells]].

Novice warlocks that were sponsored by a fiend patron had access to ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[blindness or deafness]]'', and ''[[scorching ray]]''. More experienced warlocks of the fiend were also capable of casting ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[fire shield]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''. Master warlocks under the sponsorship of a fiend could even cast ''[[flame strike]]'' and ''[[hallow]]''.
