        "text": "In the name of Skoraeus Stonebones, Your Maker, O [[Sky Cleaver]], do I summon you into the service of my hand.",
        "mainbody": "Skoraeus was born as part of the second generation of giantish deities, around the same time as [[Surtur]] and [[Thrym]], and was believed to have performed many a task for his many siblings. It was said he taught Surtur the secrets of smelting, then later taught Thrym the art of enchanting old weapons with [[runecaster|magic runes]] when Surtur refused to forge him new weapons. He crafted the [[spear]]s that [[Hiatea]] would use to complete her ten legendary tasks of valor and aided [[Stronmaus]] in his defeat of a [[tarrasque]] by tapping his hammer on undersea stone to reveal where the chain-tunnels he needed to drag the beast down were located. Eons ago he even forged his father's mighty axe, [[Sky Cleaver]].\n\nEventually, the evils committed by Surtur and Thrym and the general schisms of his pantheon would repel Skoraeus so much that he escaped them by going underground, becoming more withdrawn from his brothers and focusing on the stone giants. From then on he would ignore the evils without, but repulse any attempts made at invading his domain.",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Skoraeus was known to communicate through subtle changes in natural beauty, such as the coloration of rocks, the growth or pattern of stalactites, sparkling fountains, and the development of underground mosses and lichen."
        },
        "Personality": "Skoraeus was a withdrawn deity, generally a very dour and expressionless loner. Unlike most of his siblings he was generally disinterested in the affairs of giantkind and indeed didn't really care for any race of beings, the sole exception to this rule being his obsession with the stone giants. Though he had his reasons for his seclusion, they were more self-centered and based on introversion than those of [[Annam All-Father]].\n\nSkoraeus was often considered the wisest of the giant gods, as well as the most knowledgeable (and he was deeply knowledgeable) regarding [[magic]]s, wards, banes, hidden treasures, deeply buried wonders, and the secrets of the earth. By listening to the vibrations carried to him in areas touching rock, he could know everything that occurred there. Unfortunately for those who would want such information, Skoraeus kept his knowledge strictly to himself.",
        "Powers": "Skoraeus's avatar was immune to [[spell]]s of [[Earth (element)|elemental earth]], as well as those of [[acid]] and [[petrification]], and could only be hurt by at least ''+2'' magical weapons. He slowly healed from injury if any of him was touching raw stone, and did so nearly twice as fast if underground. He could instantly summon 2-20 stone giants to come to his aid and once per day could summon 1-4 powerful [[earth elemental]]s to serve him for two hours. He could cast ''[[crystalbrittle]]'' twice per day as well, as ''[[earthquake]]'', though reports varied on whether he could do the latter once per day or once per minute. This was assuming he used magic rather than striking his enemies with his giant fists.",
        "Possessions": "Avatars of Skoraeus were often known to carry a ''[[wand of earth or stone]]'' that would recharge at the start of each day.",
        "Divine Realm": "Skoraeus had no known residence in any given cosmology, though he was sometimes purported to lie at the heart of the world on the [[Prime Material Plane]]. In the [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great Wheel]], [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]], and [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]] cosmologies he simply wandered, though in the second he specifically roamed the mountains of [[Jotunheim]], preferably the roots of those mountains and the caves that lurked within them, and in the third he wandered across the vast, ever-changing mountainous regions of the [[Elemental Chaos]].",
        "Activities": "Skoraeus often intervened in the affairs of the stone giants to guide their development, but only sparingly dispatched an avatar to [[Toril]]. In the rare cases he did, it was to protect them, lead them to new homes, or even more rarely to lead them to (or away from) a secret magical cavern or treasure or rich veins of stones or minerals, the latter kinds of interference being legend among the stone giants. Rather than these direct manifestations, Skoraeus more often used his preferred form of influence, his understated natural omens, signs only stone giants could discern, and his priests were capable of interpreting.\n\nSkoraeus would never venture above ground, and could not even be summoned there.",
        "Relationships": "Skoraeus was one of the many children of Annam All-Father In many giant legends he was said to have sat on the sidelines while his other siblings schemed or fought. He acted as an observer and a confidant to all parties, keeping their secrets unless forced or tricked into divulging them, though in the past he was also known to use his knowledge to help them in one way or another.\n\nSkoraeus was known to occasionally consort with the [[dwarven pantheon]] as well as the gods of the [[svirfneblin]], as well as the earth god [[Grumbar]].",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "To followers of Skoraeus beauty was truth and knowledge was power, with secrets the ultimate power and the Underdark a large treasure trove of secrets.\n\nPriests of Skoraeus spent most of their time either meditating or creating intricate sculptures or friezes. They generally isolated themselves from the rest of their tribe, but believed it was their duty to oversee societal affairs and ensure that the stone giants were constantly making greater artistic strides and intellectual discoveries. As per the teachings of Skoraeus, they believed the most certain way of guaranteeing this was to isolate stone giants from all other races, even the other giant races, urging tribesmen to shun interaction with outsiders on the grounds that it might distract from their artistic pursuits.\n\nExceptions to this general rule of isolation did exist; priests of Skoraeus would tolerate other giants and individuals who could add to a tribe's mastery of craftsmanship and lore. Even so, the grave and serious priests especially avoided other giants and ultimately sought to create a stifling orthodoxy that looked inward and repulsed outside influence. Around the time of the coming of the [[Twilight Spirit]] and renewed calls for [[Jotunbrud]] unity and rebuilding [[Ostoria]], the priests of Skoraeus had to work harder than ever to achieve their goals, with many stone giants finding it difficult to ignore the outside world.\n\nLike priests, stone giant shamans cultivated aloof and indifferent behavior. They believed that the happenings of lesser mortals were to have little influence on stone giant affairs and regarded both [[law]] and [[chaos]] with suspicion, possessing an inclination to reject the overtures of either force.\n\nAn ancient tradition among the people of [[Hartsvale]] said that Skoraeus would swallow those who took ore from an unconsecrated vein.",
            "Rituals": "Where they were in power, clerics of Skoraeus required any giant who violated their god's teaching, even those pledged to another deity, to atone through meditation. Normally this was required for somewhere between one to five hours, though the varied with the seriousness of the offense, and most giants, even those of other faiths, tended to follow this custom when in a Skoraeus stronghold just to humor the clergy, as not doing so often resulted from loud, annoying, and repeated rebukes.\n\nOnce every three months or so, the priests of Skoraeus ventured down into the Underdark alone, without any provisions, on a sort of vision quest. During this time they were believed to be gifted messages and instructions by Skoraeus in the form of omens and dreams, always returning fairly unharmed within four days.\n\nShamans of Skoraeus were not required to make sacrifices or undergo trials to increase in strength, generally living as they pleased, though they could not attain the same heights of power as his priests. On occasion, however, an extremely devoted shaman sacrificed all their possessions to him, keeping not a single coin or potion. When such a shaman reached the height of their power as such, Skoraeus might decide to grant them the power to cast ''earthquake'' (a spell far beyond their regular capabilities) once per month, which aside from taking ten minutes to cast and affecting a {{SI|60|ft}} diameter behaved as a regular ''earthquake'' spell. Only 1 out of 20 of the most powerful shamans had this ability.",
            "Clothing": "The traditional dress of Skoraeus's clergy were skins, with the head kept bare.",
            "Temples": "One stone giant grotto in the [[Ice Spires]] had two enormous [[brazier]]s flanking the main entrance which burned with blue, otherworldly smoke, and which were kept burning every day in tribute to Skoraeus. According to their legends, the braziers dying out was a sure sign of an omen for Skoraeus, the two most recent (though still incredibly rare) examples being the poisoning of [[Othea]] and the death of [[Hartkiller]] and the [[storm giant]] paramount who fought him. Deeper in the grotto, was a secret sanctuary used by the high priest of Skoraeus for vigils and prayers.\n\nThe xenophobic stone giants of the [[Greypeak Mountains]] believed [[Deadstone Cleft]] was sacred as it contained an ancient temple of Skoraeus and a magical stalactite known as the Steinfang. The stone giants carved questions into the stalactite believing that the responses that came from it were from Skoraeus himself, though in truth the replies were from an evil earth [[primordial]], [[Draunn]], trapped under the Greypeak Mountains since the dawn of time.",
            "Notable Worshipers": "* [[Hgraam]], the intelligent, martially-skilled, and diplomatic stonespeaker of [[Clan Cairngorm]] in [[Gracklstugh]]."

        "Rumors and Legends": "In a classic giant tale, [[Memnor]] murmured something in Skoraeus's ear, which Surtur demanded to know. Skoraeus repeated what he had heard, resulting in Surtur brooding on the words and reacting rashly, as when taken out of context what was said was misleading. This, however, was not in any way seen as Skoraeus's fault, who had done exactly what was asked of him; if Surtur had instead asked for advice regarding Memnor's message, the legend would have ended very differently.\n\nIn another classic trickster myth however, Skoraeus was the target of a prank. The [[gnome]] inventor god [[Nebelun]] was said to have replaced his carved throwing rocks with a row of metal spheres which made various rude noises when picked up."
