The '''Way of the Drunken Master''' was a monastic tradition that taught unique fighting techniques that caused the practicing [[monk]] to appear inebriated and lacking control of their body.

==Culture==
These monks rather enjoyed acting foolishly in public places. Their clumsy and and laughable exploits often brought joy to bystanders and could be used to humiliate contemptuous onlookers. Those that followed the path of the Drunken Master were just as skilled performers as they were expert combatants,

As was expected, many practitioners of the Way of the Drunken Master spent much of their time at taverns.

==Abilities==
By all appearances, Drunken Masters were amateurish and unskilled opponents, staggering and stumbling with every step and action. Their ungraceful movements disguised carefully orchestrated movements that, when combined together, could be used to perform precise martial arts maneuvers.

Experienced Drunken Masters were exceptionally acrobatic. They learned how to wind and twist themselves in and out of battle, and could disengage from foes even while landing a series of devastating blows. Their flexibility and athleticism allowed them to spring to their feet at a moment's notice, and redirect the attacks of their opponents towards other foes.

As they continued on throughout their path, Drunken Masters appeared increasingly lucky, and were seldom caught unawares or at disadvantage.

The most masterful of these monks perfected the art of attacking numerous foes that surrounded them. They could land up to five strikes against different opponents in the same time other combatants made one attack.
