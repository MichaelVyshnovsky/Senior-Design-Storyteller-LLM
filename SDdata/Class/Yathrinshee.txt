Mistresses of undead, the yathrinshee used arcane magic along with their clerical powers to further the aims of Kiaransalee.
Yathrinshees were leaders among the church of Kiaransalee and were often the instigators of many of the churchs plots.
As yathrinshees became more experienced, they developed their arcane and divine powers simultaneously, as well as gaining mastery over necromantic magic.
Curse of the Revenancer When a yathrinshee reached a certain degree of mastery they could cause any creature they had slain to rise immediately as a zombie. This zombie was under their complete control.
Death ward Some yathrinshee were permanently warded against most forms of death magic and negative energy, allowing them to operate easily in areas unsuited to the living. Even undead yathrinshee gained increased resistance to the powers of positive energy.
Keening The final power to come under the command of a yathrinshee was a dreadful keen that could potentially kill a large number of creatures within 30 ft (9.1 m) of her. This ability manifested in a similar manner as a wail of the banshee spell.
Necromancer As yathrinshee focused on the undeath aspect of Kiaransalees portfolio, they were masters of necromancy magic. To this end, they could combine their divine and arcane potential when casting necromantic spells, putting them on a par with even dedicated necromancers despite their diversification.
Threnody Many yathrinshee could sing a lamenting song taught only to their order. This caused any who faced the undead under the command of the yathrinshee to be unnerved by images of their dead relatives. This was particularly effective if the corpse had some connection to them in life.
Zone of Desecration One of the greater powers a yathrinshee eventually wielded was a continuous aura of negative energy that hampered positive energy and simultaneously bolstered undead. Extending up to 20 ft (6.1 m), this aura operated in a similar manner to a desecrate spell.
As part of their initiation into the ranks of the yathrinshee, each member must perform numerous sex acts with some form of undead.
