The '''forester's bane''', otherwise known as a '''snapper-saw''', was a very rare type of low-growing shrub.

==Description==
This plant was largely green to dark green. Its leaves were tough and broad, with sinewy ribs that radiated {{SIrange|5|7|ft|long=yes}} from the bushy center. Within this center was three to six purple stalks with saw-toothed edges. Any leaves or stalks removed would regrow within two to eight weeks. Overall their bodies measured {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} in a radius.

Within the center of this bush grew large, plump berries that had a sweet smell to them. These berries were typically bright yellow, golden, greenish, or white. They were said to be very delicious and rich in protein.

==Behavior==
These plants possessed no intelligence.

==Biology==
Whenever a creature stepped on or near the leaves of this plant, they would snap shut around them. The saw-toothed edges on the plant's stalks then gradually sawed away at the trapped prey.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
