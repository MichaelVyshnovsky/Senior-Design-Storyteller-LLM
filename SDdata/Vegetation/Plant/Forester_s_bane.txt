The foresters bane, otherwise known as a snapper-saw, was a very rare type of low-growing shrub.
This plant was largely green to dark green. Its leaves were tough and broad, with sinewy ribs that radiated  from the bushy center. Within this center was three to six purple stalks with saw-toothed edges. Any leaves or stalks removed would regrow within two to eight weeks. Overall their bodies measured  in a radius.
Within the center of this bush grew large, plump berries that had a sweet smell to them. These berries were typically bright yellow, golden, greenish, or white. They were said to be very delicious and rich in protein.
These plants possessed no intelligence.
Whenever a creature stepped on or near the leaves of this plant, they would snap shut around them. The saw-toothed edges on the plants stalks then gradually sawed away at the trapped prey.
Foresters bane was a carnivorous species of plant.
This shrub was known to grow in the Forest of Mir and the jungles of Chult.
Foresters bane was a favored plant of the deity Sheela Peryroyl.
