'''Daggerroot''', also known as the '''executioner's garnish''' was a species of [[herb]] found in blood-soaked areas of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
Daggerroot was known to flourish in spots where blood was spilled onto the ground. Executioner's garnish was often sold in bundles, each worth fifteen [[gold]] [[coin]]s.

==Usages==
When dried and burned, daggerroot plant ash was combined with special types of [[salt]] to create ''[[oil of accuracy]]''.

==Notable Users==
* Auntie [[Ethel]]: a [[hag]] in disguise who lived in the Western Heartlands ''circa'' [[1492 DR]].
