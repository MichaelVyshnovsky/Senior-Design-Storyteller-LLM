Daggerroot, also known as the executioners garnish was a species of herb found in blood-soaked areas of the Western Heartlands.
Daggerroot was known to flourish in spots where blood was spilled onto the ground. Executioners garnish was often sold in bundles, each worth fifteen gold coins.
When dried and burned, daggerroot plant ash was combined with special types of salt to create oil of accuracy.
