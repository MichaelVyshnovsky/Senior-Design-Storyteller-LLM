'''Nararoot''' was a tuber that was used as birth control throughout [[Faerûn]]. Much cheaper than [[cassil]] [[herb]]s, which were used by men, nararoot shavings were taken by women. Nararoot could be diluted and steeped into tea for a more pleasant flavor. Ingesting nararoot rendered the drinker infertile for a week or two.
