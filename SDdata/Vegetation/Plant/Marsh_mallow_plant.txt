Marsh mallow plants were tropical curative herbs found in the Malatran jungles.
Marsh mallow plant could be boiled into a draught that gave the imbiber restful sleep and healed their wounds during sleep. The concoction could be created by cooking the plants leaves and roots together. One portion of the resulting draught held enough liquid for six uses.
In the 14 century DR, marsh mallow leaves and roots were known to be gifted to good travelers by the lesser nature spirits of a Malatran vanilla grove, Timon and Pumba.
