'''Marsh mallow plants''' were tropical curative [[herbs]] found in the [[Malatra]]n jungles.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin/Certificates}}

==Description==
Marsh mallow plant could be boiled into a [[draught]] that gave the imbiber restful sleep and healed their wounds during sleep. The concoction could be created by cooking the plant's leaves and roots together. One portion of the resulting draught held enough liquid for six uses.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], marsh mallow leaves and roots were known to be gifted to good travelers by the lesser [[Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]]s of a Malatran [[vanilla]] grove, [[Timon]] and [[Pumba]].
