The so-called '''killer grass''' was a type of living grass that began appearing in the regions of the [[Backlands]] and [[Pelleor's Prairie]] near the [[Anauroch]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''If they have not been reported before, it could be that no humanoids ever ran across them before, at least, no one anyone else would believe. I mean, who else but a lackwit would come back from exploring the desert's edge telling a strange story of killer grass with razor-sharp teeth? Even I would probably have a hard time believing such a story, yet I've heard of some strange things in my time.''|Excerpt from ''[[Elminster's Ecologies Appendix I]]''}}

==Description==
According to eyewitness' killer grass were diminutive sentient creatures with a distinct head and lanky limbs that resembled thin blades of grass. Interestingly enough, their feet had small curved "toes" used to attach themselves to the ground, staying anchored during windy days, common on Pelleor's Prairie. Despite their delicate appearance, the creatures' bodies were heavier than one would think they would be, and their bodies were tough. They stood at {{SI|0'6|'"|long=yes}}, brownish green in color, and said to be carnivorous creatures, evidenced by mouths full of sharp teeth. Their faces had sharp, pointed features: eyes, long ears, and a tiny, almost unnoticeable slitted bump of a nose.

==Ecology==
It was speculated that they could've been birthed by the strange magics that slowly expanded the Great Dessert of Anauroch or, possibly, were exposed due to the expansion.

The killer grass fed on small mammals, lizards, and similar animals found inhabiting the prairie.

==History==
As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the existence of the killer grass was a little-known and even less studied occurrence. These plants were described in the ''Elminster's Ecologies Appendix I'' [[book]] in which the author, [[Elminster Aumar]], reported coming across a single dead individual killer grass brought to him by [[Spurl]], a friend who resided in the eastern Pelleor's Prairie. Spurl kept mum and visibly shaken when asked how he possessed such a rare creature.
