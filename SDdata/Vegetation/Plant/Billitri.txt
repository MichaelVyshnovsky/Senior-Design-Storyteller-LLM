Billitri plants were fragrant herbs found in the Malatran hills and mountain slopes.
The plant itself was a small and delicate herb with many thin leaves and up to three small flowers of lavender color with a yellow center. An average billitri plant was about  long.
Billitri plants leaves could be crushed to extract a highly fragrant juice that could be used as perfume. The same smell could mask creatures scents from dangerous predators of the Malatran Plateau. The scent was pleasant but potent enough to cling to ones body for several days after application. Some cultures used the leaves of billitri plants in magic rituals.
In the 14 century DR, billitri leaves were known to be gifted to goodly travelers by the lesser nature spirits of a Malatran vanilla grove Timon and Pumba.
