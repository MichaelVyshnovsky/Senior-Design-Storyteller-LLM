Due to its size, magasorium was often hard to find. When crushed, leaves of magasorium plants released juice that could be used as an effective insect repellent. A single plant could be used to create six doses of this repellent. A single topical application lasted for around four hours however, it could be washed off or diluted with excessive sweating. Burning the plant was also an effective way of keeping jungle insects at bay.\nIn the 14 century DR, magasorium leaves were known to be gifted to goodly travelers by the lesser nature spirits of a Malatran vanilla grove Timon and Pumba.\nCategoryHerbs\nCategoryPlants\nCategoryVegetation\nCategoryFlowers\nCategoryInsect repellents\nj7ww1h3c5tz093ofefcpqxqmk1llzio"
