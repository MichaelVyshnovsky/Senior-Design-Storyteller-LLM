Caper was a flowering bush that produced edible flower buds, simply known as capers.
Capers were a rare sight in the Realms and were used in cooking. The Friendly Arm inn on the Sword Coast offered veal medallions served covered with a sauce of capers and cream. Pickled capers were sold by Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 50 gold pieces per quart.
