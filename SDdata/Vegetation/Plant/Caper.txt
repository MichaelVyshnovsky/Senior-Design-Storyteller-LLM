'''Caper''' was a flowering bush that produced edible flower buds, simply known as '''capers'''.

==Description==
Capers were a rare sight in the Realms and were used in cooking. The [[Friendly Arm]] inn on the [[Sword Coast]] offered [[veal]] medallions served covered with a sauce of capers and [[cream]]. Pickled capers were sold by ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' for 50 [[gold pieces]] per quart.
