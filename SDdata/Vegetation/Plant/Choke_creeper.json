        "Description": "[[File:ChokeCreeper-MC2.png|thumb|227x227px|''Another man falls victim to a choke creeper.'']]\nThe central stem of a choke creeper was typically {{SIrange|1|2|ft}} thick, though some specimens were noted to have a thickness comparable to that of a tree, and could grow to be over {{SIrange|20|160|ft|long=yes}} with several other vine branches fanning out from it in all directions. On average there were around four to eight vines along each {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} section of the choke creeper and sixteen at its center.\n\nThe vine branches of a choke creeper on average grew to be {{SIrange|9|16|ft|long=yes}} and had an olive green hue. These branch vines had flexible tendrils that allowed them to move {{SI|5|yards}} per minute. The smallest of choke creepers had around eight branches, while the largest typically had around sixty four.",
        "Behavior": "Choke creepers possessed no form of sentience, but they were attracted to light, heat, and movement.",
        "Abilities": "Any damage to the vines of a choke creeper would not harm the central plant itself. Small fires, such as that given by a [[torch]], had no effect on them. Severe cold and cold-based [[spell]]s could temporarily impede their movement. By contrast, running electricity through them was known to cause their vines to move faster.\n\n[[File:StranglingVine.png|thumb|227x227px|''The corpse of a past victim dangles from a choke creeper.'']]",
        "Combat": "These plants were so named for their tendency grapple unsuspecting creatures and squeeze them with a strangling grip to the point of death.",
        "History": "The existence of choke creepers on [[Toril]] dated back to at least the days of [[Netheril]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], choke creepers began to grow beneath the waters of the [[River Ashaba]], threatening the balance of that ecosystem.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some speculated that the choke creeper may in some way be related to the [[hangman tree]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Choke creepers typically grew in the forests of regions with a temperate climate.\n\nIn [[north Faerûn]] they could be found in many of the heavy forests of [[Cormanthor]], [[Daggerdale]], and [[Shadowdale]]. Particularly in the [[Border Forest]], the [[Vale of Lost Voices]], [[Spiderhaunt Wood]], and the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]].\n\nIn [[interior Faerûn]] they could be found in much of [[Cormyr]]'s temperate forests, In this region they could also be found in the lands of [[Sembia]] and the [[Dalelands]].\n\nIn [[west Faerûn]] choke creepers grew in the [[Forest of Tethir]], the [[Forest of Mir]].\n\nIn [[South Faerûn]], they grew in the [[Forest of Amtar]] and the [[Thornwood]].\n\nBeyond [[Faerûn]], choke creepers could be found in the jungles of [[Chult]] and the land of [[Ra-Khati]] where they infested the ruins of [[Kuo Meilan]]."
