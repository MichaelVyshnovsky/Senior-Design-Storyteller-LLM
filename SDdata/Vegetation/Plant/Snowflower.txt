The '''snowflower''' was a plant that grew in cold climates.

==Description==
Like an arctic version of tumbleweed, snowflowers tumbled across the ice in the wind. They had vibrant purple, pink, or yellow-green flowers.

==Habitats==
Snowflowers grew in crevices in ice and rock. They could be found in the regions of [[High Ice]] and the [[Great Glacier]].

==Ecology==
The snowflower was edible by [[humanoid]]s. It was also a favorite of [[ice worm]]s, long furry creatures that dwelt in glaciers.

Besides their use as foodstuff, snowflowers could be used as a component in perfume.
