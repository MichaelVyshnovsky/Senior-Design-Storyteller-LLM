The snowflower was a plant that grew in cold climates.
Like an arctic version of tumbleweed, snowflowers tumbled across the ice in the wind. They had vibrant purple, pink, or yellow-green flowers.
Snowflowers grew in crevices in ice and rock. They could be found in the regions of High Ice and the Great Glacier.
The snowflower was edible by humanoids. It was also a favorite of ice worms, long furry creatures that dwelt in glaciers.
Besides their use as foodstuff, snowflowers could be used as a component in perfume.
