It was commonly found on the [[Malatran Plateau]] as well as the desert of [[Anauroch]]. Both root bulb and long green [[asparagus]]-like spears were edible and possessed curative properties. Even when dead, allium plants retained their properties, as was evident by them never rotting nor breeding any [[fungus]] nor molds. When eaten whole, it protected the imbiber from [[poison]]s and [[disease]]s, or it reduced the duration of such afflictions.\n\nInhabitants of Anauroch, both [[humanoid]]s and [[beast]]s, consumed allium as a good source of always precious water.",
