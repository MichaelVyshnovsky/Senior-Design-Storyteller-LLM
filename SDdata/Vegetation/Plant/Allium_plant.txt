'''Allium plants''' were curative [[herbs]] found in the [[Malatra]]n jungles.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin/Certificates}}

==Description==
Allium was a hardy [[onion]]-like root vegetable plant that reached {{SI|12|inches|long=yes}} in length. It was commonly found on the [[Malatran Plateau]] as well as the desert of [[Anauroch]]. Both root bulb and long green [[asparagus]]-like spears were edible and possessed curative properties. Even when dead, allium plants retained their properties, as was evident by them never rotting nor breeding any [[fungus]] nor molds. When eaten whole, it protected the imbiber from [[poison]]s and [[disease]]s, or it reduced the duration of such afflictions.

Inhabitants of Anauroch, both [[humanoid]]s and [[beast]]s, consumed allium as a good source of always precious water.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], allium plants were known to be gifted to goodly travelers by the lesser [[Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]]s of Malatran [[vanilla]] grove [[Timon]] and [[Pumba]].
