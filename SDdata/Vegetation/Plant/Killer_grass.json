Interestingly enough, their feet had small curved \"toes\" used to attach themselves to the ground, staying anchored during windy days, common on Pelleors Prairie. Despite their delicate appearance, the creatures bodies were heavier than one would think they would be, and their bodies were tough. They stood at , brownish green in color, and said to be carnivorous creatures, evidenced by mouths full of sharp teeth. Their faces had sharp, pointed features eyes, long ears, and a tiny, almost unnoticeable slitted bump of a nose.\nIt was speculated that they couldve been birthed by the strange magics that slowly expanded the Great Dessert of Anauroch or, possibly, were exposed due to the expansion.\nThe killer grass fed on small mammals, lizards, and similar animals found inhabiting the prairie.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the existence of the killer grass was a little-known and even less studied occurrence. These plants were described in the Elminsters Ecologies Appendix I book in which the author, Elminster Aumar, reported coming across a single dead individual killer grass brought to him by Spurl, a friend who resided in the eastern Pelleors Prairie. Spurl kept mum and visibly shaken when asked how he possessed such a rare creature.\nCategoryPlant creatures\nCategoryPlants\nCategoryVegetation\nCategoryCarnivorous creatures\n929wgrvbs0ac2avsl63l29gm1jyoeus"
