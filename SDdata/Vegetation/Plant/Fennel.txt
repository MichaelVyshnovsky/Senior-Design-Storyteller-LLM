'''Fennel''' was an aromatic plant often used as a spice or herb, found in kitchens from the [[Sword Coast]] to [[Ravens Bluff]] in the [[Vast]].{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Living City: The Painted Boat Restaurant|15}}

==Description==
Fennel roots and seeds were the most commonly used parts of the plants. An ounce (28 grams) of fennel seeds was valued at 1 single [[silver piece]].

==Usages==
===Culinary===
In the [[Moonsea]] region, fennel was used in the making of [[rabbit]] soup with [[thyme]]. That dish was a favorite of a giant magical [[cat]] named [[Gamaliel]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

[[Neverwinter]]'s [[Moonstone Mask]] offered its guests [[mushroom]]s cooked in a sauce of various [[herb]]s, including fennel, [[garlic]], and [[scallion]]s among others.

[[Calishite]] [[spice]]d [[wine]] was flavored with a collection of herbs, spices, and fruits, including fennel.

===Magic===
The ''[[identify]]'' [[spell]] required fennel in order to create [[ink]] for its scribing.{{Cite dragon/62/Pages from the Mages|19}}

Fennel was among the herbs used in the creation of a [[homunculus]].

In the days of ancient [[Netheril]], fennel could be found among alchemical ingredients used in [[potion]]-making.

===Medicine===
Some believed that the fennel plant possessed medicinal properties, helping with digestion, weight control, muscle tone, reflexes, and vision, and having many other applications.

Fennel-and-[[hyssop]] poultices were found in ancient [[Cursrah]]. Crushed fennel petals and stems were also used as a sweet-spicy aromatic together with hyssop, bee balm, sour [[camomile]], woodsy [[sage]], and many other herbal ingredients.
