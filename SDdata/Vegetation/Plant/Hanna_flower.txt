'''Hanna''' was a flowering plant native to the [[Malatran Plateau]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Sharp Teeth, Mostly Tasty|12}}

==Description==
The plant's pollen was gathered by the [[Kukalatu]], the tribe of reformed [[Nubari]] cannibals that inhabited the shored of the [[Hebika River]] on the Malatran Plateau. The pollen was used by the Nubari [[priest]]s to empower their curative magics, ensuring the most potent healing provided.

A Malatran ''[[potion of enhancement]]'' was brewed using a mix of hanna flower pollen and several other ingredients that were kept in secret by the Nubari [[witch doctor]]s.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Quest for the Snake Mother|4,12}} If hanna pollen was simply added to water and consumed, it acted as a ''[[cure light wounds]]'' [[spell]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Legacy of the Headshrinker|9}}

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, the Kukalatu [[Council of the Almost Ancestors]] rewarded a group of heroes of the Living Jungle with hanna flower pollen after they aided the tribe in the nearby [[Moaning Cave]]. Witch doctor [[Bengoukee]] also supplied heroes who aided him in appeasing [[Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]]s of Malatra with hanna pollen concoctions.
