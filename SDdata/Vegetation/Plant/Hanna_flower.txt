Hanna was a flowering plant native to the Malatran Plateau.
The plants pollen was gathered by the Kukalatu, the tribe of reformed Nubari cannibals that inhabited the shored of the Hebika River on the Malatran Plateau. The pollen was used by the Nubari priests to empower their curative magics, ensuring the most potent healing provided.
A Malatran potion of enhancement was brewed using a mix of hanna flower pollen and several other ingredients that were kept in secret by the Nubari witch doctors. If hanna pollen was simply added to water and consumed, it acted as a cure light wounds spell.
In the late 14 century DR, the Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, the Kukalatu Council of the Almost Ancestors rewarded a group of heroes of the Living Jungle with hanna flower pollen after they aided the tribe in the nearby Moaning Cave. Witch doctor Bengoukee also supplied heroes who aided him in appeasing nature spirits of Malatra with hanna pollen concoctions.
