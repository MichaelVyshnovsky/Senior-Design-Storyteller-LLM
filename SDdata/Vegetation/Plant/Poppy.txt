==Habitats==
Places in the ''Realms'' where poppies could be found growing included the following:
* In the [[Dalelands]], poppies could be found growing in [[Archendale]] and [[Tasseldale]].

* Poppies could be found in parts of [[Kara-Tur]], such as a large field of them known as the [[Golden Bowl]]{{Cite dungeon/9/The Golden Bowl of Ashu H'San|35}} and in parts of the [[Malatran Plateau]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Masks of the Dohi-ri|8}}
* Poppies were grown decoratively in the town of [[Auckney]] near the [[Spine of the World]] and in the [[Moonsea]] region.
