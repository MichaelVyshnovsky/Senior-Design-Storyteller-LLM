        "Description": "The plant itself was a small and delicate herb with many thin leaves and up to three small flowers of lavender color with a yellow center. An average billitri plant was about {{SI|0'6|'\"|long=yes}} long.\n\nBillitri plant's leaves could be crushed to extract a highly fragrant juice that could be used as [[perfume]]. The same smell could mask creatures' scents from dangerous predators of the [[Malatran Plateau]]. The scent was pleasant but potent enough to cling to one's body for several days after application. Some cultures used the leaves of billitri plants in magic rituals.{{Cite organized play/LJ/The Curse of Fire Mountain|8}}",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], billitri leaves were known to be gifted to goodly travelers by the lesser [[Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]]s of a Malatran [[vanilla]] grove [[Timon]] and [[Pumba]].",
