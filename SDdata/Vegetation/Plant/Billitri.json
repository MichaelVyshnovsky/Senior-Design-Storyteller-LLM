An average billitri plant was about  long.\nBillitri plants leaves could be crushed to extract a highly fragrant juice that could be used as perfume. The same smell could mask creatures scents from dangerous predators of the Malatran Plateau. The scent was pleasant but potent enough to cling to ones body for several days after application.
