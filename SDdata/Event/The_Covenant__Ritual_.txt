The '''Covenant''' was a sacred ritual performed daily by the faithful of [[Oghma]], the Lord of Knowledge.

==Description==
This ritual was performed every evening by Oghma's faithful. It involved a brief service where a passage from a work of knowledge was read aloud or recited from memory. A song or poem was then performed for Oghma, followed by mentioning aloud an item of knowledge learned that day.
