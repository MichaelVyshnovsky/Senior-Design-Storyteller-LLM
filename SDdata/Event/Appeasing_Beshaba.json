        "mainbody": "ppeasing Beshaba was a ceremony performed when one wished to gain Beshabas favor and avoid bad luck.\nIn order to appease Beshaba, the supplicant held a valuable item of theirs over an open flame until it was at least partially destroyed. The supplicant would repeat Beshabas name over and over as the offering burned. A prayer praising the Maid of Misfortune was then said while the supplicant was on their knees.\nBeshaba was believed to pay more attention and grant her appeasement to supplicants who burned their fingers during the ceremony."
