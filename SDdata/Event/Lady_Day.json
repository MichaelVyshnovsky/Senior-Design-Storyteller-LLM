        "mainbody": "'''Lady Day''' was an annual spring festival dedicated to [[Mystra]], the goddess of magic.",
        "Description": "Lady Day was a grand celebration that consumed the [[wizard]] nation of [[Halruaa]] every spring and ended in a beloved spring regatta above the waters of [[Lake Halruaa]].\n\nHalruaans who celebrated Lady Day donned bright red festive [[silk]] garments and, by the time the regatta kicked off, assembled on the shores of the lake, making it appear as if the shored suddenly blossomed in the heather of crimson flowers. The regatta took place on the evening of the festival's last day. After the sunset, street musicians stopped their day-long performances, and the air filled up with cheers as a dozen of ''[[Halruaan skyship]]s'' rose from the waters of the lake and performed graceful flying movements in formation on the backdrop of sparkling stars. A typical formation was that of the ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Mystra, nine glittering ships moving in a perfect circle around the King's biggest and grandest ''skyship''. The King's skyship burst into mesmerizing bright red magical flames as the surrounding ships began to blink with the gentle starlight. The magical pyrotechnics made it appear as if the ships moved around the King's vessel faster with each consecutive pulse of light until they appeared to be a glowing ring encircling a flaming pyre that symbolized Mystra and, through her, the land of Halruaa.\n\nThe ''skyship'' performance was accompanied by rhythmic foot-stomping from the crowds and roaring cheers when the performance culminated in a brilliant burst of magical light and swarms of glittering motes showering the adoring crowds. The glittering motes of magical energies clung to the red ropes of festival-goers and lasted until the following dawn.\n\nThe rest of the festival concluded with traditional fortune readings, diviners counseling, temple services, and more localized celebrations in each of the many neighborhoods of Halruaa."
