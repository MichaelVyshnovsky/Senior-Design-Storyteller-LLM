'''New Harvest Festival''' was an annual celebration observed in [[Purfbin Doogrick]]'s [[gnome|gnomish]] home burrow.

==History==
Each festival was a grand feast with numerous important gnomish guests, copious food, and a presentation of new inventions. The burrow's Chief Cook oversaw the preparation of famous dishes such as large communal pots of [[potato]] [[Harvest Stew]] and sizable bowls of [[New Harvest Punch]]. One celebration, in particular, was remembered well by guests. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, young inventor Purfbin Doogrick convinced that year's Chief Cook [[Bitty Bitterbreath]] to present his grand invention - [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]]. Purfbin guided the machine towards a pile of unpeeled potatoes, imagining the fame and respect the invention would bring him. Distracted, the youth lost control of Shred-o-Matic 1000, and it went for the guests. The massacre resulted in the loss of [[Dame Edza]]'s prized wig and [[Mayor Whimblesnort]]'s expensive new silk hat.
