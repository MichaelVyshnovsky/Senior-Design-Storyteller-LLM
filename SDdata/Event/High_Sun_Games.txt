The '''High Sun Games''' was a tournament for [[adventurer]]s that took place in [[Neverwinter]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Criticized as brutal and bloody, they were ended by Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] but briefly revived by Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Location==
The revived High Sun Games were held in the newly built [[Neverwinter arena]], which stood at the foot of [[Castle Never]] in the [[Blacklake District]].{{HAT-layout}}

Adventurers from across [[Faerûn]] entered the High Sun Games in hopes of winning both glory and a significant prize. Wealthy folk of the [[Sword Coast]] bet big on them, specifically on how each contestant would meet their doom. In the lead up to the event, merchants outside sold drinks and food (including fruits from the city's gardens), goods and souvenirs such as [[jewelry]], [[water clock]]s, and glass [[lamp]]s, while performers including acrobats, jugglers, and fire-eaters entertained the crowds. For all that it was a blood-sport, it gave the often-beleaguered people of the city something and someone to cheer for.

In Forge Fitzwilliam's revived games, there were five stages, known as "challenges", which were undertaken by up to five teams, with three competing in each stage. [[Magic]]-users could be fitted with lockable ''[[magic-suppression cuff]]s'' to block the use of any supernatural abilities. Those who survived each stage and made it to the "cage of sanctuary" would go on to the next stage. The movable pillars of the Neverwinter arena floor could be used to create a course for each stage, such as a maze, zones, and even a pyramid, and these pillars could have stationary [[gelatinous cube]]s built in.<ref group="note">A pyramid was originally planned for the arena battle in ''Honor Among Thieves'' before being changed to a maze, as explained and depicted in ''The Art and Making of''. It's presumed a pyramid is still possible. In each stage, contestants would face a variety of monsters and traps. For example, in a middle stage, they were hunted by a [[displacer beast]] through a maze that would periodically shrink as outer layers were removed, as marked by a mechanism that banged a gong. Contestants could find weapons in chests, but some of these chests were [[mimic]]s. Other advertised monsters included a [[beholder]], a [[rust monster]], and a [[hook horror]].

==History==
===Early Games===
The High Sun Games first started sometime in the 1400s DR.{{speculation}}<ref group="note">With nothing of the kind seen in earlier sources on Neverwinter, the Games are presumed to be a more recent invention, suiting the darker depiction of the city in 4{{th}} edition, rather than the positive portrayal in earlier editions. They likely began after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] or after the [[Mount Hotenow]] eruption in [[1451 DR]].

However, Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] banned the High Sun Games as he considered them to be too brutal,The date of this is also unknown, but it was likely when Edgin Darvis was young and after or shortly before Dagult took power, so likely in the early 1470s DR.  [[Edgin Darvis]]'s father took him to see the final Games, where one contestant made it to the last round, only to be half-eaten (specifically the top half) by a [[remorhaz]].While the ''Honor Among Thieves'' movie only says "a monster", the novelization (based on an earlier script) clarifies this is a remorhaz.

===Forge's Game===
But after [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] deposed Dagult Neverember and took power as Lord of Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} one of his main acts was to revive the High Sun Games.As no structure of the kind has been seen or mapped in Neverwinter before, the arena is presumed to be new and built by Forge. The timber from the logging of [[Neverwinter Wood]], also ordered by Forge, may have gone into its construction. The first Games were to be held in the late 1490s DR, allegedly as a way of bringing the city together. It also brought many visitors from outside Neverwinter, including rich, powerful, and unscrupulous people—people like [[Din Caldwell]] and [[Porb Piiradost]], two of the wealthiest men of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Waterdeep]] of the day, who wanted to bet big on the Games and brought their riches with them, which Forge graciously offered to store safely in the [[Castle Never]] vault. He even raised a [[hot-air balloon]] over the city with his own grinning face on it.

Finally, Forge opened the revived High Sun Games from atop a pillar at the center of the Neverwinter arena. Addressing the crowd and announcing the rules of the competition, he asked that no one leave the arena until the very end, promising a gift to each of the spectators. Competing in these games were several [[adventuring company|adventuring companies]], including:
* A group of the [[Gray Hands]],The Gray Hands are only mentioned in ''Honor Among Thieves'' and do not appear on screen. It's unknown if these are the same Gray Hands or an adventuring company of the same name. If they are the same, it's unclear why they're here, acting outside Waterdeep and apparently not on a mission. One possibility is that the Gray Hands are permitted to compete and represent Waterdeep in the Games. Another is that they are also investigating Forge and Sofina because of a perceived threat to Waterdeep.
* A group comprising a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]], a [[dragonborn]], a [[human]] [[barbarian]], a [[rogue]], a [[ranger]], and a [[wizard]];
* A group comprising the ranger [[Hank]], the [[monk]] [[Diana]], the [[fighter]] [[Eric]], the wizard [[Presto]], the rogue [[Sheila]], and the barbarian [[Bobby]]; and
* A late-entry group comprising the [[bard]] [[Edgin Darvis]], the barbarian [[Holga Kilgore]], the [[sorcerer]] [[Simon Aumar]], and the [[druid]] [[Doric]].
In one stage, the latter three groups faced a displacer beast, mimics, and gelatinous cubes in a maze. However, the displacer beast would take out much of the second group, while Hank's team made it to the cage of sanctuary and went on to the next stage. However, Edgin's group, being there unwillingly, escaped by leaping inside a gelatinous cube in order to be carried down into the tunnels beneath the arena. In a later stage, Din Caldwell bet '20,000' on the Gray Hands.

In fact, the High Sun Games were all a trick, and a trap. Forge had stolen the riches of his wealthy visitors from the Castle Never vault and smuggled them out via the tunnels beneath the arena and had it all loaded aboard a ship for his getaway as he abandoned the city to his advisor [[Sofina]], who had much of the populace gathered together in the arena for her dark purpose. Revealing herself to be a [[Red Wizard of Thay]], Sofina invoked the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' in order to turn all the spectators into [[undead]] and thereby seize the city for [[Szass Tam]], the Regent of [[Thay]]. The red smoke of the Beckoning Death filled the luxury balcony and turned all the gamblers and their servants into ravening [[zombie]]s. Fortunately, Edgin and his thieves used a ''[[portal]]'' from their ''[[hither-thither staff]]'' to pour the stolen treasure from Forge's hot-air balloon and over the stands and streets, leading all the people out of the arena. This interrupted both the Beckoning Death and the High Sun Games.
