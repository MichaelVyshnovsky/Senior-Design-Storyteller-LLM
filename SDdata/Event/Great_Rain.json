        "mainbody": "he Great Rain was a weather event that was part of the Second Sundering from the autumn of 1485 DR to late 1486 DR.\nA mystical event, meant to heal the wounds of the Spellplague, it nevertheless caused crops to fail and with them caused widespread hunger. A magical ritual conducted by the elder circle of the Emerald Enclave and the chosen of Lathander, Stedd Whitehorn, at first hastened the rains and then brought them to an end, but not before raising the sea level of the Sea of Fallen Stars roughly back to what it was before the Spellplague. It also magically restored the farmlands and crops of the country."
