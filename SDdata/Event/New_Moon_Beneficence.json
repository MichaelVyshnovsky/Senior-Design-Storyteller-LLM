        "mainbody": "The '''New Moon Beneficence''' was a charitable feast in [[Yhaunn]] held monthly by the temple of [[Sel√ªne]], [[Moonshadow Hall]].",
        "Description": "The New Moon Beneficence was a public feast for the city's poor held at Moonshadow Hall, open to all faiths. The event was instituted by High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]] in order to bring positivity and joy to the night of the new moon through feasting and song.",
        "History": "In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], Moonmistress-Designate [[Feena Archwood]] met with representatives of the city's administration, guilds, merchants, and other temples to raise support for a larger version of the feast which would support more people. Although the idea met with general approval, during the next new moon the feast held at Moonshadow Hall was interrupted by an attack by [[Sharran]]s and [[shadow mastiff]]s led by [[Variance Amatick]]."
