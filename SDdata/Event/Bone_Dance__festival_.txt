The '''Bone Dance''' was a religious hunting festival dedicated to [[Malar]] the Beastlord and practiced in [[the Vast]]. It was held on the night of the [[Eleasis 9|9{{th}}]] of [[Eleasis|Highsun]] and hosted by [[cleric]]s of Malar.

==Description==
The Malarites animated the skeletons of great [[deer|stag]]s and other beasts, and the oldest and youngest members of the community played hunters. Together, they enacted exciting hunting scenes and held a pageant around a bonfire, called the Bone Dance. There was also a great feast in which everyone ate and drank until late in the night.

Early the next morning, they ventured out to track, hunt down and kill dangerous predators or monsters known to be in the area.

The Bone Dance was more popular in the smaller country communities than in the cities.
