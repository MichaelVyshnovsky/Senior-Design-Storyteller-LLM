The '''Celebration of the Moon''' was a religious festival observed by worshipers of [[Hathor]], the Nurturing Mother within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
[[Priestess]]es of Hathor referred to [[Midsummer's Eve]] as the Celebration of the Moon to honor their [[goddess]]. The priestesses spent the entire day in revelry and singing uplifting hymns. That evening was often spent trysting under the moon, resulting in a large number of newborn babies among Hathor's faithful the following year.
