The Celebration of the Moon was a religious festival observed by worshipers of Hathor, the Nurturing Mother within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Priestesses of Hathor referred to Midsummers Eve as the Celebration of the Moon to honor their goddess. The priestesses spent the entire day in revelry and singing uplifting hymns. That evening was often spent trysting under the moon, resulting in a large number of newborn babies among Hathors faithful the following year.
