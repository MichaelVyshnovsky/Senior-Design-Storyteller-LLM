The Phandelvers Pact was a pact made circa the 10 century DR.Phandelver appears to be a concatenation of "Phandalin", the town close to the mine, and "delver", a term used for those who descended down into the mines.
The pact was, initially, an agreement between a gnome and dwarf clan. Later, a group of human spellcasters and those of the town of Phandalin became allied with them.
The formal agreement of the pact was essentially that the three parties would share the profits of the Wave Echo Cave. The cave had great mineral wealth, and was highly magical. The human mages, along with the original clans of the pact, bound the magical energy into a forge known as the Forge of Spells. The magical forge could be used to enchant items, such as dwarven weapons and gnomish gadgets.
After the pact was established, all parties benefited greatly. Phandalin, especially, became very prosperous.
In 951 DR, orcs from Uruth Ukrypt laid waste to the entire town of Phandalin leaving only a few burnt out shells behind. All parties of the pact fought together, but were severely outmanned, and were eventually overthrown. The successful pact ceased to exist once the orcish brutes destroyed most of the area. The cavern became lost to history.
In 1491 DR, Gundren Rockseeker believed he had found the location of the legendary mines of the Phandelvers Pact.
