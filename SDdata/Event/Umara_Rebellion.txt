The '''Umara Rebellion''' occurred in the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Umara]].

==Activities==
Khan [[Ubar khel Muhif]] of the [[Astok]] tribe offered his service to the Caliph of Umara once he attained [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightenment]]. Ubar decided to seize an opportunity when the Caliph's forces were busy battling the forces of [[Muluk]] in a separate engagement. Ubar staged a coup within the palace and deposed the former Caliph. He married the Caliph's daughter, [[Maran ber Ubar|Princess Maran]] to solidify his claim. Forces from [[Qudra]] were sent to Umara in response to the rebellion, but order had been restored before they arrived. Qudra accepted Ubar's claim as Caliph in order to prevent an extended siege of Umara.

==Outcome==
Ubar became Caliph of Umara, bringing with him many barbarians of the Astok tribe. Tension between native Umarans and the newly introduced barbarians was extremely high, brewing for a potential clash.
