        "History": "This ritual was used as a purification process of novices entering into Leira's clergy, by other [[priest]]s rising in rank, or as a form of penance for slighting their faith (usually by telling the truth too often). The participant would walk down a column lined with other priests holding tall lit [[candle]]s that were reflected by pools and [[mirror]]s."
