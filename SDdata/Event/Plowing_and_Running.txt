The '''Plowing and Running''' was an annual holiday observed in [[Waterdeep]] and its rural surroundings. It celebrated the plowing of fields and running of livestock, and also involved numerous racing competitions within the city.

==Location==
The sporting events within the city involved all the wards of Waterdeep and were considered the occasion in which they came to life unlike any other time.

==Activities==
In the rural communities surrounding Waterdeep, the holiday was celebrated as a traditional joint effort of tilling and preparing the farms and moving livestock.

Within the city, the holiday took the form of a series of foot, [[chariot]], and [[horse]] races. Each ward held separate competitions in all three categories. The winners from each individual ward then competed in a final event in the [[Field of Triumph]].

The winners were paraded in the [[House of Heroes]] by cheering crowds and were honored within its halls through the installation of name plaques or visages.

The race winners also traditionally played theatrical roles in the reenactment of [[Kistarianth]]'s defeat during the celebrations of [[Dragondown]] on [[Kythorn 20]]. The chariot champion played the role of [[Athar]], while the horse champion played the role of [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]].
