The Ceremony of Honor to Helm was a religious event observed by worshipers of Helm, He of the Unsleeping Eyes.
The ceremony occurred every four years on Shieldmeet following the last day of Flamerule and the first day of Eleasis. This was the only calendar-specific event observed by all members of the Helmite faith and Church of Helm.
