The Plowing was the traditional time for breaking ground in readiness for planting throughout the land of the Vast. It began on the 6 of Mirtul.
On this day, the people in each community formed teams and worked together to plow each others fields for free, going on until every farmer in the area had at least one field ready to sow. This could go on for up to four days.
There was a feast in the evening, at which casks of ale allowed to age over the winter were opened at dusk.
The Plowing was, of course, more popular in the country communities than in the big cities.
