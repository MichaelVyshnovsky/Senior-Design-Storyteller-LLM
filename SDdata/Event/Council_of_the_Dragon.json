        "mainbody": "The '''Council of the Dragon''' was a noble moot called by King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] of [[Cormyr]] to discuss the ruling of the Realm.\n\n{{Quote|''I have heard your anger, directly and by report of what you have said aloud but not to my face. Remember that I must rule justly over all Cormyreans, high and low. I am prepared to dispense with evasions, long speeches, and insults, and deal plainly, here and now. So, what rights and privileges are you, good lords of the realm all, most concerned with?''|[[Foril Obarskyr I]], during the Council of the Dragon in {{yearlinkName|1479}}}}",
        "Location": "The Council of the Dragon was held in the [[Castle Obarskyr/Hall of Justice|Hall of Justice]] in Castle Obarksyr.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|29|3}}",
        "Activities": "There was to be open discussion, and a vow of magically enforced loyalty to Prince [[Irvel Obarskyr]], starting at highsun.",
        "Outcome": "In the eve of the council, [[blueflame ghost]]s murdered [[Seszgar Huntcrown]],{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|261|25}} and then likely [[Gariskar Dauntinghorn]] and [[Draskos Crownsilver]],{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|259-260|35}} raising alarm among the nobles. Then on the day of the council, following the machinations of the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]], the room was flooded with deadly poison gas, demanding a day's delay.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|37-39|4}}\n\nWhen the moot was finally held, before any vows occurred, the nobles made a number of demands that while individually reasonable, would have not just nulled the [[Suzail Writ]], but granted the nobility much more power than before.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|87|9}} Several demands that ensued, such as that of [[Landrar Dathcloake]], who demanded that nobles be able to form a council to control all of Cormyr, rather than the royal family, went even beyond. [[Obraerl Foulweather]] and [[Mulcaster Emmarask]] both pushed forward for this, despite Foril's position being that it was a red line for him. When the last one claimed this was the will of [[Alusair Obarskyr]], her [[ghost]] manifested and denounced his position as a load of bull. Rather than back off, he doubled down, and claimed she wasn't really the princess; Alusair immediately walked through him, and he fell to the ground, twitching.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|90-92|10}}\n\nThings degenerated quickly after that, with many nobles forming a ring around the king, and a battle ensuing, in which at least one [[Highknight]] and one [[War Wizard]] died. After Prince Irvel Obarskyr's ''[[ironguard]]'' was tested, he was ushered out of the room just in time for a [[blueflame ghost]] to appear and start cutting down nobles. She disappeared after killing Lord Foulweather.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|93-94|10}}\n\nThen [[Amarune Whitewave]], a mask dancer housing the consciousness of the fugitive [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]] at the time, used a perfected version of the ''[[call bones]]'' spell to fatally debone every noble who attacked the King.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|95|10}}",
        "Aftermath": "Predictably, word on the streets was that Cormyr had been plunged into civil war afterwards. There were a number of killings that could be assumed to have been precipitated by the opportunity, such as the death of Lord [[Windstag]], for which no other cause was known.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|268-269|28}} The rumors blew the situation out of proportion somewhat, claiming that the Royal Family had died, for instance."
