The Battle of Hawa was a naval conflict that occurred between the mamluk fleet from Qudra and the corsairs of Hawa in .
The battle took place on the waters of the Great Sea within the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara.
Qudra attempted to conquer Hawa, the center of power for the corsairs, once and for all. They sailed on the corsair capital without sufficient magical support with the hopes of taking the enemy by surprise. Qudra was repelled with great losses. The mamluks would have been utterly crushed were it not for the efforts of Qazim al-Satir who managed to save many of the mamluks ships with his magic.
In addition to the physical loss of men and ships, Qudra suffered a debilitating hit on their overall morale. Qudras display of weakness was noted by others as well and encouraged the Free City of Utaqa to rebel.
