The '''Blood Festival''' was a special feast held by worshipers of [[Garagos]].

==Activities==
A Blood Festival could be called when seven or more priests of Garagos were together. The priests feasted with a least a portion of the food being butchered at a nearby table and consumed while still bloody and not fully cooked.
