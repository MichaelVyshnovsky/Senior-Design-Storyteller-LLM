        "Outcome": "The Ritual of the Dark Flames allowed a loyal devotee of Cyric to conjure and wield black flames born from [[negative energy]] itself. The use of this supernatural power was etremely taxing on the mind and will of its wielder.\n\nIt was regularly performed upon members of the [[Company of the Ebon Spur]], to bolster their prowess on the battlefield.",
        "History": "The ritual was developed some time during or after the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, when Cyric drove himself mad by reading from the ''[[Cyrinishad]]''. It was still being performed regularly as of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
