Founders Day was an annual holiday celebrating the founding of the city of Waterdeep. It was held on Flamerule 1.
Several locations in the city commemorated the holiday. In the Field of Triumph, the history of the city was retold through illusory displays. The stadium was also the site of martial exhibitions by the City Guard.
It was also common for festhalls throughout the city to hold costume contests. Participants dressed up as historical figures such as Raurlor and Khelben the Elder and the best impersonators were awarded prizes.
A particularly spectacular practice was the veiling of Castle Waterdeep with an illusion that made it appear like the ancient fortress of Nimoar. The illusion required the combined efforts of several wizards and was typically in place between midday and sunset. It was considered an extraordinary display of magical art.
In the midâ€’14 century DR, the practice of covering multiple locations of the city in illusions was deemed distracting and frivolous and was abolished for several decades. However, by the late 15 century DR, at least the custom of masking Castle Waterdeep had been reinstated.
On Founders Day in the , Ammalia Cassalanter planned to poison multiple people during a feast in order to offer their souls as sacrifice to Asmodeus in an attempt to save the souls of her younger children, while at the same time her husband Victoro Cassalanter planned to steal the hoard of dragon coins from the Vault of Dragons as the monetary counterpart of the deal.
