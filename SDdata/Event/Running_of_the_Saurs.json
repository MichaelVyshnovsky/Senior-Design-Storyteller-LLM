        "mainbody": "The Running of the Saurs was an event held in Port Nyanzaru in Chult as of the late 15 century DR. It was not to be confused with&mdashand was significantly more dangerous than&mdashthe citys famous dinosaur races.\nIn the annual Running of the Saurs, a wide variety of rider-less dinosaurs&mdashincluding stegosauruses, triceratopses, and dimetrodons&mdashwere let loose to run through the city as locals and visitors evaded them. The stampeding river of dinosaurs smashed timbers, swept up fruits, flattened baskets, and generally made a mess of the streets. Cleaning up afterward was not a quick process. \nLocal sailors and citizens partook in watching or running, and shops closed during the event. The chaos also made the event well-suited for thieves and burglars to ply their trades.\nWhile the event was chaotic, the dinosaurs ran from the Market Ward through the Merchants Ward and into the Old City. Places like the Grand Souk were well-protected against the dinosaurs, and provided safe haven for people trying to escape them.\nWhen the Running of the Saurs was held during the time of the death curse, the event was marked both by a large amount of banditry&mdashwith some pirates even trying to shake down the high priestess at the Hall of Gold&mdashas well as the appearance of undead in the Old City, which caused the panicking and confused dinosaurs to reverse direction and flood back into Port Nyanzaru."
