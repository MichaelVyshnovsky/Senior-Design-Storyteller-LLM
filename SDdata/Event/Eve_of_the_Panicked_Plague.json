        "History": "The deadly disease known as the [[Panicked Plague]] descended on the nation of Chondath one evening in the early spring of the {{YearlinkName|472}}. The Chondathan port city of [[Mussum]] exploded in a rapidly moving plague that killed over 75% of the city's population overnight. No medicines made a difference, and the cause of the outbreak remained unknown. Survivors of the plague fled Mussum for the neighboring city of [[Iljak]], leaving their homes abandoned. As of the late 14{{th}} century, the ruins of Mussum remained abandoned as a grim reminder of the Eve of the Panicked Plague. Many [[adventurer]]s tried to enter the ruins only to be found dead later along the road."
