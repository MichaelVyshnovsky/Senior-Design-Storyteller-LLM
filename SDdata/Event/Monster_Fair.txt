The Monster Fair was a regular grand fair that took place in the main plaza of Halarahh, Halruaa.
The Monster Fair brought cattle ranchers, monster breeders and hunters, and other purveyors of exotic beasts from all across the land. The creatures sold in the market stalls were as mundane as bull aurochs and fuzzy elephants, or as rare and curious as fancy pet lizards, colorful birds of the Mhair Jungles, griffon kittens, dragon eggs, unicorns, and anything else that could be trained, ridden, butchered for food or spell components.
A great open plaza that opened immediately past Halarahhs harbors was the space used by open-air markets and various festivals throughout the year. The Monster Fair was one of the events that took place on the colorfully-paved floors of the plaza.
