The '''Monster Fair''' was a regular grand fair that took place in the main plaza of [[Halarahh]], [[Halruaa]].

==Description==
The Monster Fair brought cattle ranchers, monster breeders and hunters, and other purveyors of exotic beasts from all across the land. The creatures sold in the market stalls were as mundane as bull [[aurochs]] and fuzzy [[elephant]]s, or as rare and curious as fancy pet [[lizard]]s, colorful [[bird]]s of the [[Mhair Jungles]], [[griffon]] kittens, [[dragon]] eggs, [[unicorn]]s, and anything else that could be trained, ridden, butchered for food or [[spell component]]s.

==Location==
A great open plaza that opened immediately past Halarahh's harbors was the space used by open-air markets and various festivals throughout the year. The Monster Fair was one of the events that took place on the colorfully-paved floors of the plaza.
