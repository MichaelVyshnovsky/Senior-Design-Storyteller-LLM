        "mainbody": "he Gilding was a rite observed by worshipers of Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs.\nDuring a Gilding a group of Deneirrath priests gathered in a circle and took turns casting special spells on a hovering manuscript. Each spell cast impressed a single large golden letter upon the manuscript, eventually writing out the Words of Deneir. The manuscript was then set on display for the public to view. Any thieves caught trying to steal one of the golden letters were punished severely."
