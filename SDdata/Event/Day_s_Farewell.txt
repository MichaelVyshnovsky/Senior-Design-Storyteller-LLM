'''Day's Farewell''' was a formal ceremony observed by the clergy of [[Bhaal]].

==Description==
At the end of the day prior to sleeping, priests of Bhaal would engage in ceremonial practice where they prayed to the Lord of Murder. This ritual also occurred when members of the clergy set off on a mission to kill.

==Location==
Though this ceremony could take place anywhere, such ceremonies were known to be carried out in temples, and when so, it would be conducted en-masse.
