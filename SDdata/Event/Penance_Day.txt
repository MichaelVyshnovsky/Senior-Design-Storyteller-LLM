'''Penance Day''' was a religious festival observed by the lamas and [[monk]]s of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]].

On the eve of Penance Day, participants were temporarily released from all their vows and engaged freely in various indiscretions. For example, the lamas of [[Do'dzin Gompa]] typically drank their potent [[mujahroom]] alcohol. The penance, presumably, was what came the morning after.
