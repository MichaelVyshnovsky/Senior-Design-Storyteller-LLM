Caravance was a festival held in Waterdeep as part of the Waukeentide holiday.
The festival celebrated the arrival of the first spring caravans to Waterdeep. During the day, celebrants hid gifts in their homes for their children to find, saying that Old Carvas had left them.
The festival was named after the mythical figure of Old Carvas, an old peddler who was said to have arrived in the city with the first caravan, driving a wagon filled with toys that he distributed among Waterdhavian children.
Originally a separate holiday, Caravance was incorporated into Waukeentide and became the first of the tenday-long holidays many festivities.
