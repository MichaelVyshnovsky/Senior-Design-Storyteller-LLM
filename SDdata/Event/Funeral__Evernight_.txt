A "'''funeral'''" was a nightmarish execution carried out by the [[ghoul]]ish denizens of [[Evernight]] if ever they captured a living [[humanoid]] in their city. It blended the ghouls' cannibalistic hunger with their religious faith.

==Description==
Living people were generally regarded as food to the [[undead]] inhabitants of Evernight unless they had been granted citizenship by the ruling [[Evernight#Government|tribunal]]. However, if a ghoul captured a humanoid in the city, it would generally not eat that humanoid immediately unless they were particularly ravenous. Instead, the victim was delivered to the [[priest]]s at the [[Temple of Filth]] for a funeral service that would result in them being buried alive to die slowly. Only once their corpse had begun to rot was it reclaimed and eaten.

==Location==
"Funerals" required the soon-to-be-deceased to look their best, and so they were first taken to [[Lamantha's mortuary]] to be sedated (with a paralytic agent derived from ghouls' humors), cleaned, and dressed in fine clothing.

==Activities==
The service at the Temple as well as the trip to the Graveyard were performative religious affairs. Prayers were made to ask for blessings from [[Doresain]] during the funeral ceremony, and the formal procession to bury the victim included triumphant songs honoring both Doresain and [[Orcus]]. 

==History==
As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, quite a few of Evernight's living visitors were unfortunate enough to be given a funeral.
