Ippensheir was annual twelve-day celebration of the Church of Gond, as well as the faiths sole calendar-related event, that began on the first of Mirtul and ended on Mirtul 12. It was named for Saint Ippen.
During this time, all members of the Church of Gonds clergy would gather together at abbeys, temples, or holy sites where a famed inventor or craftsmen had once worked. Some Gondar visited as many of these gatherings as possible by either using personal teleportation magics or the network of portals maintained by the clergy that linked major, defensible holy houses of the faith.
While at these sites the Gondar would share their innovations, exhibit their inventions, as well as speak of those they had witnessed to their fellow Gondar. They also held feasts, drank much, and engaged in general revelry.
During this time, it was said that sometimes Saint Ippen would appear before Gondar that were in need.
