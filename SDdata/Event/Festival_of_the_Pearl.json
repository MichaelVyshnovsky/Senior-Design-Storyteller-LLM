        "mainbody": "he Festival of the Pearl  was a yearly celebration that occurred in Gana within the Pearl Cities of west Zakhara. \nGana hosted the Festival of the Pearl every year.\nAccounts between sailors, divers, and captains were settled and the sultan and mosque officials distributed a great feast among the people of Gana. Celebrants danced in the streets, shot skyrockets into the air and even broke the law by acting lewd and inebriated on public streets. This behavior made outsiders regard Gana as a \"wild city.\"\nThis three day celebration was held annually following the close of the pearl season. The end of the Festival of the Pearl marked the beginning of the Great Task of the Pearl."
