The '''Hidden Gift''' was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Geb]], the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
Every evening [[priest]]s of Geb selected a single stone from the ground and buried it within the earth while chanting prayers. Along with a twin ceremony called the [[Bountiful Joy]], the Hidden Gift celebrated the discovery of precious assets found within the earth.
