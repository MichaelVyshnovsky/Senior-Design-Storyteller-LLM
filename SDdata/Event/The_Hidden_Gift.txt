The Hidden Gift was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of Geb, the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Every evening priests of Geb selected a single stone from the ground and buried it within the earth while chanting prayers. Along with a twin ceremony called the Bountiful Joy, the Hidden Gift celebrated the discovery of precious assets found within the earth.
