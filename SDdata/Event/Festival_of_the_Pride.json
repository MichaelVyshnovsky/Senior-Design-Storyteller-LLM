It was considered a time for frolicking and romance, as the followers of Nobanion believed any children or cubs conceived during the festival would grow to to become the ruler of the local church, or in the case of [[wemic]]s, their pride.\n\nThe festival took place during the first week of [[Ches]]. It was followed three and a half months later by the [[Newborn Celebration]], with the time in between representation the gestation period of a newborn [[lion]]."
