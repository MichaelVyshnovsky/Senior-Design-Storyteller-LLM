        "mainbody": "Ahghairons Day was a holiday in Waterdeep, celebrated on the first of Eleasis, to honor the citys first Lord, Ahghairon.\nWhile the city maintained its civic operations, the Lords Court would close and the Open Lord would visit local taverns and greet the citys citizens. They were greeted by toasts to the Citys Lords and bards singing ballads to honor the \"Old Mage\" Ahghairon. Waterdhavians would leave violets at Ahghairons Tower, the Plinth or at the various altars within the House of Wonder."
