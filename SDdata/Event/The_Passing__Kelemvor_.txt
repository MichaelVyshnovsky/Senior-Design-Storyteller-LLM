The '''Passing''' was a religious event observed by worshipers of [[Kelemvor]], the Lord of the Dead.

==Activities==
[[Priest]]s of Kelemvor performed this ceremony when someone died, offering last rites for the deceased in the form of a chant so Kelemvor would be aware that their soul was on its way to him.
