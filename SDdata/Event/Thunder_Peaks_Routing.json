        "mainbody": "he Thunder Peaks Routing was a fifteen-year armed conflict between goblinoids of the Thunder Peaks and the cities of Saerloon and Selgaunt that started in 400 DR.\nIn the , the merchants and traders of Chondathian and Chauncelgaunt (later known as Sembian cities of Saerloon and Selgaunt, put out a call for aid against goblin raids that were exhausting their defenses. Without outside help, Saerloon and Selgaunt were to surely be wiped off the face of Toril. The nation of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach could not spare any troops as it was dealing with a similar crisis. The help came from the nation of Chondath that planned on expanding its influence north through the friendly occupation when the threat was over. Chondath marched almost half of its troops to the lads that would later become Sembia. For the 15 years that followed, Chondathian and Chauncelgaunt, with the aid of Chondath, battled the goblinoid threat. Eventually, the hordes of savage humanoids were pushed back to the Thunder Peaks, granting the embattled cities safety and the opportunity to expand.\nIn the outcome, the ruling Chondathan Illistine Dynasty kept their armies fortified in the young nation of Sembia to protect it and to cement Chondathan influence."
