The '''Kiss of the Lady''', also known as '''kissmoots''', was the most important ceremony of the [[Church of Shar]].

==Activities==
The Kiss of the Lady consisted of the clergy of Shar committing murder and other vile acts in the Dark Lady's name throughout the night, ending with a feast at dawn. The ceremony occurred irregularly, only when decreed by the leaders of certain influential sects of the church.
