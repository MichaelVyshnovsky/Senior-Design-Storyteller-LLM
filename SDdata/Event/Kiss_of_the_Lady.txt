The Kiss of the Lady, also known as kissmoots, was the most important ceremony of the Church of Shar.
The Kiss of the Lady consisted of the clergy of Shar committing murder and other vile acts in the Dark Ladys name throughout the night, ending with a feast at dawn. The ceremony occurred irregularly, only when decreed by the leaders of certain influential sects of the church.
