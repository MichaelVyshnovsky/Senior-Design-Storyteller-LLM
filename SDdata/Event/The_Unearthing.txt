The Unearthing was a holy day observed by worshipers of Eshowdow, the Shadow Giant within the Chultan pantheon.
The exact date of this dark celebration varied on a yearly basis but was always marked by gloomy, cloudy weather. The clouds would part to reveal an eclipse on a day of great significance to Eshowdow. These eclipses were only visible to anyone standing within the Valley of Lost Honor. Eshowdows faithful marked his disinterment and his promise of revenge against the tabaxi during the Unearthing.
