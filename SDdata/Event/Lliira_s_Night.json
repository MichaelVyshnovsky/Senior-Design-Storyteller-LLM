        "History": "Some time prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Lliira's Night began life as a festival confined to the city of [[Waterdeep]].\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century, this festival had spread from its native city to [[Baldur's Gate]] and across the [[Sword Coast]]. Around this time, a store in Baldur's Gate by the name of [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] used [[smokepowder]] fireworks to celebrate the event and over time it quickly became a staple tradition within the holiday. In Waterdeep, handling of the celebration's fireworks was the duty of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]].",
        "Activities": "[[File:Lliira's Night dancer.png|thumb|''A masked dancer dressed in a traditional garb for the celebration.'']]\nThe festival consisted primarily of dances and balls, which were held throughout a city. In Waterdeep, the high-point of these nightly balls was the \"Cynosure Ball\"&mdash;this was jointly sponsored by the [[Church of Lliira]]'s clergy, the local nobility, and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. Outside of formal balls, carefree dancing and various other pursuits that fell within the Lady of Joy's purview were prevalent in [[festhall]]s all throughout.\n\nDuring this holiday, many were known to [[dye]] their clothes or armor in colors of blue, antique gold, and coppery-orange. Many were also known to wear ceremonial, star-shaped [[mask (object)|masks]]. Cuisine commonly associated with the festival included [[barbecue]]d meats as well as juices and alcoholic beverages of a pink color."
