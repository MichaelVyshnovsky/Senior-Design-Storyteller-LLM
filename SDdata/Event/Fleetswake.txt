Fleetswake was a festival held in Waterdeep during the last tenday of Ches. It celebrated the sea and deities associated with it, as well as maritime activities.
The festival was dedicated to the sea itself, as well as maritime trade. Special respect was paid to all deities of Faer√ªn associated with the sea, navigation, and weather.
Most of the events festivities took place in the Dock Ward, although taverns such as the Fiery Flagon in the Sea Ward also enjoyed intense activity during the holiday.
The events many activities included
* Boat races involving private boats and the rakers of the City Guards naval branch
* The Shipwrights Ball at the Shipwrights House, located at the corner of Asterils Way and Dock Street in the Dock Ward
* Galas at the Copper Cup festhall, located in Smugglers Run close to the South Gate.
* The Fair Seas Festival, held on the last two days of Fleetswake and characterized by the consumption of large quantities of seafood and the contribution of donations to Umberlee.
During the entire event, ships were not charged the typical docking fees of the city, but their captains were expected to contribute with donations of at least 1 gp per day they remained docked.
All donations collected in the festival were then consigned to Umberlees Cache, a sunken treasure located in the deepest part of Deepwater Harbor that was fiercely protected by merfolk and surrounded by myths and legends.
Different versions of the festival were known to be held in Waterdeeps harbor since long before the founding of the city, when trading caravans started meeting in the location from  onwards.
