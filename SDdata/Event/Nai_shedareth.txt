NaiShedareth was a ritual duel between two priestess of Lolth, where the victor would be presumed to be the most favored by the goddess.
The two priestesses would each chant a prayer to Lolth. If no manifestation of the goddess could be summoned—meaning that neither of them had her favor—they would be summarily executed. However, if the goddess responded to the prayer of one of the priestesses, she was accounted the winner and could demand death, dethronement, or worse for her vanquished rival.
One instance of this deadly ritual occurred when Shakti Hunzrin challenged Liriel Baenre in Ascarle in the . Liriel accepted the challenge, and having become a Zedriniset, killed Shaktis snake whip and sent her to the Abyss.
