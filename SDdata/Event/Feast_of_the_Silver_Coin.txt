The '''Feast of the Silver Coin''' was a religious celebration observed by worshipers of [[Nephthys]], the Guardian of Wealth and Commerce within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]]. The same holy day was known elsewhere in [[Faer√ªn]] as the [[Feast of the Moon]].

==Description==
During the Feast of the Silver Coin, [[priestess]]es of Nephthys celebrated a somber day-long event where they gave thanks to their [[goddess]] and tithed half of their wealth at day's end.
