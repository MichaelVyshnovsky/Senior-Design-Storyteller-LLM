The '''Grand Melee''' was an annual tournament held by the [[Melee-Magthere]] academy of [[Menzoberranzan]], for the purpose of testing students' progress in their training. 

==Description==
The tournament was overseen by one of the instructors at the academy. Participants would face other students from the class of their year, though in some cases exceptionally skilled students could be moved to a group composed of students a few years their senior.

The participants had to pick a starting position within the cave the event took place in, after which the instructors would give them a signal to begin. The students used wooden poles imitating real weapons to fight their opponents, though there were no restrictions in use of magic or other forms of aid. The overseeing teachers would constantly watch the competitors and would ultimately decide who was defeated in combat. Following their command, the beaten student had to lay down on the ground to signal that they were "out".

Working in teams was allowed and would happen frequently, though as there could be only a single winner at the end of the competition the members of said team had to turn on each other and fight for the top spot.

==Location==
The actual arena for the fighting was located in a cave outside of Menzoberranzan. It was filled with stalactites and stalagmites, which split the floor of the cave into a maze full of nooks and crannies that the competitors could set ambushes in. Towards the ceiling, catwalks were constructed in order to allow the instructors to view the ongoing fighting and order knocked out participants to lie down.

==History==
During his years spent at the academy, the legendary ranger [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] participated in the Grand Melee as well. Following the initial failure at his first attempt (when he was betrayed by his colleague [[Kelnozz]]) he managed to win seven times in a row. He was eventually placed in a class of students three years his senior, which he managed to dominate in the competition as well.
