The '''Five Fires Rising''' were riots that occurred in the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The riots occurred sometime between {{Yearlink|1350}} and {{Yearlink|1357}}. In the chaos, a dangerous [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Nchaser's Eiyromancia]]'' was stolen from the library of Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]].
