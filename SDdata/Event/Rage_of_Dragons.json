        "mainbody": "Rage of Dragons, or Dracorage, was a periodic Realms-wide event that occurred when many dragons went on a collective, senseless rampage, destroying everything in their path.\nRages could take place in a number of different cycles. Some took place every few decades, while others every few centuries.\nThis periodic madness seemed to be tied to the appearance of the King-Killer Star, and could last for several tendays. The exact extent of a single Rage of Dragons was theoretically tied to the exact position of the King-Killer Star when it appeared in the skies above Toril. However, in 1373 DR the lich Sammaster triggered an unanticipated Rage.\nSometimes, however, the Rages were localized, less intense events, depending on the astrological position of the King-Killer Star. In the event of a localized Rage of Dragons, the more common label was a Flight of Dragons.\nDuring a rage, a pressure built in every dragons mind, which gradually reduced their ability for judgement they could fight it for a time, but it slowly built, day by day, until even the most powerful of dragons would be made to cave in. Once the damage began to accrue, there was no way to heal it until the Rage was over or the dragon found their way out of the affected area somehow. Dragons also found themselves becoming more unhinged, uninhibited, less concerned with morality, or even ethics those whose natures were almost inherently connected with those would endure it better, but even their willpower would eventually be overwhelmed. If their loss of function was great enough, they started becoming more hostile to all nondragons. Dragons eventually gained in strength from the Rage, but lost all ability to use spells while so boosted in fact, during a Rage, they were constantly at risk of getting overwhelmed by fury if anything were to damage them.\nDragons in a rage found themselves calling to one another, to better revel in the lust for destruction the spell instilled in them, forming dragon flights that grouped dragons and dragon-blooded creatures by the dozen to strike at whatever they found.\n*The gold dragon king Orchtrien was overwhelmed almost instantly in , sadistically slaying his own underlings and then fighting his own armies to death in stupid ways, only to find the effect waning immediately upon death.\n*King Lareth, also a gold dragon, was driven to heights of paranoia, narcissism and irrationality in 1373 DR before he finally forced his underlings hand into turning against him, he nearly killed one of his underlings upon mixing him up with another, and taking the conflation of their actions as proof of treachery.\n*An ooze drake hunted by Dorn Graybrooks party found itself distracted during a rage, muttering furiously to itself and preparing for a flight.\n*The song dragon Karasendrieth felt the effects of the Rage progressing upon her own mind, beginning by making her react strongly to fresh blood, then slowly making her more irritable, then making her nearly eat her beloved during an act of passion. Though she developed a counterspell, proximity to the source of the Rage finally made her erratic enough to attack her friends before attempting a suicidal charge.\n*The copper dragon Chatulio also suffered the effects of the Rage harshly, first making him extremely irritable, then making him attack his own allies, and finally spurring him into a suicidal scheme.\n*The dragon turtle Chorael was driven to a suicidal attack on some fishermen.\n*The half black dragon monk and former bandit Drakken Thaal was assaulted by nightmares that made him think he had committed a murder. Then he was driven to fight until he was mortally wounded.\n*The copper dragon Chalintash found themselves suddenly overwhelmed one night, attacking the town of Beregost and forgetting their own spell abilities.\n*The mercury dragon Trinculo, during a bout of sorrow, began to consider disturbing possibilities, and grinned hungrily at their lifelong friend, whom they dropped in the sea before attacking Evermeet.\n*The black dragon Insithryllax lost control of himself in the Thayan Enclave of Innarlith where he frequently resided, began transforming from his human to dragon form indoors, liquefied one of the residents of the enclave with his breath and sought to destroy the temple of Chauntea in Innarlith before he was transported safely away to a pocket dimension by the Red Wizard Marek Rymüt\nSome dragons were even affected by a Rage early, even as far back as Uktar 9 of  for the Rage of the next year.\nThere were almost no effective countermeasures for the Rage. A dragon that truly sought to avoid it could put themselves to sleep, which would slow the progress of the Rage tenfold taking a different creatures shape through magic only reduced the effect five times instead. A spell, abate dracorage, allowed the Rage to subside for just under a tenday, maybe more, and helped reverse some of the damage. Other spells, even a full wish, could only control the damage, and even then, only a days worth of it. Even an antimagic field would only stop the damage from accumulating, rather than allow for it to heal. There were only a few other spells, specifically king-killer shield, that could completely stop the Rage.\nOnly extreme measures could really stop the Rage, including infusion with Far Realm energy, converting the affected dragon into an aberration, or undeath.\n* c.  The so-called first \"flight of dragons\", when Nagamat led the first dragons of Faerûn to destroy the Aearee Empires.\n*  The creation of the Dracorage mythal trigger the Dracorage tied to the King-Killer Star.\n* c.  According to the Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, the first Rage occurred when the maddened dragons destroyed the kingdom of Darastriverthicha.\n* c.  A flight of dragons destroyed the city of Calimport, starting the Dragon Wars.\n* 1018 DR Dragon attacks struck all around Faerûn. The Cult of the Dragon attempted to claim credit for the destruction.\n* 1356 DR The last recorded flight of dragons resulted in the destruction of cities and deaths of thousands across the Moonsea, Dalelands, Cormyr, and other regions.\n* 1373 DR The last Rage of Dragons, and also the most violent and longest lasting of all (it lasted a whole year), resulted in the destruction of the Dracorage mythal, thus ending the magical curse upon dragonkind."
