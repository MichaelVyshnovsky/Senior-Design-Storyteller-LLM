The priest would drink the blood of an ibrandlin while the high priest of one of Ibranduls churches, called an Impenetrable Lurker, performed a magical ceremony. The magic of the ritual caused much of the priests arms, chest, back, and legs to become covered in hardened overlapping scales, offering a great deal of protection at the cost of making them a terrifying sight to behold."
