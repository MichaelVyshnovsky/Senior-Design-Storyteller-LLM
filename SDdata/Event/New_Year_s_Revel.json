        "mainbody": "New Years Revel was an annual celebration of a new years arrival according to the Calendar of Harptos. It was celebrated across Faerûn in different ways, depending on local traditions, with the first day of the new year being a day off.\nNew Years Revel took place during winter, with its frigid winds howling drowned out by boisterous drinking, feasting, singing, and laughing, notably, in the Lake of Steam region. New Years gifting was a tradition in Sembia. Most customs for the celebration across Faerûn included a hearty meal on New Years day, with families gathered together, remembering passed away members, telling stories, and toasting. In a similar manner, if a New Years meal was held in the company of friends or amongst travelers on the road, each participant took a turn toasting and remembering a person dear to them who had passed away. Members of churches celebrated by praying to their primary deity, making a vow or a promise to them of a deed or, a resolution or a goal to achieve during the upcoming year. In Waterdeep, the New Years day was a holiday during which people were allowed a day off work to stay home and sip on ciders and broths.\nSimilar celebrations were held amongst the elves, with the celebrating of Yeartide. Dwarf worshipers of Berronar Truesilver considered the new years day a holy day. The new years celebration was also present in the planes the city of Sigil celebrated the Day of Grace."
