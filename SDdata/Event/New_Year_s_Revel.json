        "Description": "New Year's Revel took place during winter, with its frigid winds' howling drowned out by boisterous drinking, feasting, singing, and laughing, notably, in the [[Lake of Steam]] region. New Year's gifting was a tradition in [[Sembia]]. Most customs for the celebration across Faerûn included a hearty meal on New Year's day, with families gathered together, remembering passed away members, telling stories, and toasting. In a similar manner, if a New Year's meal was held in the company of friends or amongst travelers on the road, each participant took a turn toasting and remembering a person dear to them who had passed away. Members of churches celebrated by praying to their primary deity, making a vow or a promise to them of a deed or, a resolution or a goal to achieve during the upcoming year.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} In [[Waterdeep]], the New Year's day was a holiday during which people were allowed a day off work to stay home and sip on [[cider]]s and [[broth]]s.\n\nSimilar celebrations were held amongst the [[elves]], with the celebrating of [[Yeartide]]. [[Dwarf]] worshipers of [[Berronar Truesilver]] considered the new year's day a holy day. The new year's celebration was also present in the [[planes]]; the city of [[Sigil]] celebrated the Day of Grace.{{Cite polyhedron/127/The Day of Grace|23}}"
