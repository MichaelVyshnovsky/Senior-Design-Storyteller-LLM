        "mainbody": "he Night Plague was a critical event in the history of the city of Zhentil Keep in the Moonsea region.\nThe original followers of Zhentar grew their powers and gradually faded from public view or passed their positions on to others. What the inhabitants of Zhentil Keep did not know was that Zhentars followers grouped together in the crypts beneath the city and achieved lichdom. Unlike most other liches, the liches, who were later called \"Those Who Walk By Night\", worked together to expand Zhentars original goals. However, the passage of time slowly eroded their minds to the point where they eventually rose up to haunt the streets of Zhentil Keep beginning in the .\nBusinesses began to close early and people barricaded themselves in inns and taverns. Only the brave or foolish walked the streets at night. It was only after several notable merchants were slain and commerce began to suffer that the Lords decided to take any action. The Zhentilar began to grow as the need for a proper defense mounted. Skilled soldiers, backed by powerful wizards and priests of Bane, swore fealty to the Council of Lords. The wizards in control of the Zhentilar cared little for the threat from the Night Plague, but used it as a convenient excuse to bolster their grip on the city.\nThey did indeed clash mightily with the liches, but at least a few of those battles were surely staged for dramatic effect. The only outcome from such clashes was the destruction of property of Lords who opposed the Zhentilar. In truth the Zhentilar bribed, coerced, and threatened the liches until they agreed to return underground where they belonged. The only lich truly slain during this time was Vingril, but an adventuring company called the Golden Stag took the credit for that.\nThe liches still existed as of the midâ€“14 century DR and were still alive in the Zhents memory, although probably most of them had been destroyed, incapacitated, or grown insane with the passing of time, if they hadnt attained demilichdom already and moved onto other goals. Zhentish legends tell that Those Who Walk by Night were magically bound into their crypts by Zhentilar spells. People feared they would be released the day the Zhentilar lords no longer ruled the city."
