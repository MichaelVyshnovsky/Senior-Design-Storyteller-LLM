        "Description": "In the city of [[Innarlith]], this festival was celebrated at the [[Cascade of Coins]]. The temple would remain unguarded as the guards would go inside to be showered with [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[coin]]s by the people who took part in the festival. People would also cast coins down a well that sat in the middle of the temple.\n\nIn most temples, guards and soldiers were invited to partake in grand feasts hosted by the Church of Waukeen. Bigger temples used Marthoon to sponsor retirement of lucky guards and soldiers giving them their weight in gold ten time multiplied."
