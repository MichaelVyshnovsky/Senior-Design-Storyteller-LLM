Guildsmeet was a festival held in Waterdeep as part of the Waukeentide holiday.
The festival started with the meeting of the various Guilds of Waterdeep in their respective halls for the announcement of new policies and a commemoration of their activities in the previous year. Following those meetings, the guilds sponsored a gala festival and dance that lasted from dusk to dawn. The dance was traditionally held in the Cynosure, the Field of Triumph, and the Market, typically also dominating all the streets and locations in the area between them.
Originally a separate holiday, Guildsmeet was incorporated into Waukeentide and became one of the tenday-long holidays many festivities.
