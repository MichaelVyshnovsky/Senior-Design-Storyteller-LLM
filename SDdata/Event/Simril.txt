Simril was an annual winter festival on Nightal 20, celebrated along the Sword Coast in cities such as Waterdeep,
Simril was chiefly celebrated after dark, when the stars were visible across the sky. Celebrants located stars associated with their own births, or with their ancestors. Those without a lucky star could purchase star maps from merchants to help divine which belonged to them, based on when and where they were born. Cloudy weather was considered especially favorable on Simril, as finding ones star in an overcast sky was viewed as a blessing from Tymora. Simril was celebrated outside, with people trying to stay awake the entire night gathered around bonfires with plenty of music, food, and warm drinks.
Feasts during Simril were decorative affairs featuring foods such as boar, dried fish, goat, grains, ham, and potatoes.
In the lead up to one Simril during the late 15 century DR, raids on farmsteads and inns near Luskan threatened to leave many without enough food for either the festival feasting or for the rest of winter. The culprits were twofold bandits in the mountains and a ferocious local yeti.
