A Candle Rite was a sacred ceremony observed by worshipers of Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain.
A Candle Rite was celebrated every twelfth night, assuming it did not coincide with the Rite of Pain and Purity, by priests of Loviatar. The priests would sing, chant, and pray while dancing around lit candles. The priests would make sure part of their body passed over the hot flames on each pass. The ceremony ended when the highest ranking priest extinguished the candles with consecrated wine.
