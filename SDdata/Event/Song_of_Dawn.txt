The '''Song of Dawn''' was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Lathander]], the Morninglord.

==History==
The Song of Dawn was performed on [[Midsummer]] morning, the mornings of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, and on other important occassions. During the song [[priest]]s of Lathander praised their [[deity]] with their voices during a complex blend of harmonies and counterharmonies.
