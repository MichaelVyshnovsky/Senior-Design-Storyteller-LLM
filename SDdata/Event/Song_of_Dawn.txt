The Song of Dawn was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of Lathander, the Morninglord.
The Song of Dawn was performed on Midsummer morning, the mornings of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, and on other important occassions. During the song priests of Lathander praised their deity with their voices during a complex blend of harmonies and counterharmonies.
