The '''Unwrapping''' was a religious festival observed by worshipers of [[Geb]], the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
The Unwrapping occurred every year on the first of [[Mirtul]] in what the [[Mulhorandi]] called the "Time of Melting" because of the melting of the snows. The diminishment of the winter snow often revealed new caves to explore that hopefully held riches from the earth.
