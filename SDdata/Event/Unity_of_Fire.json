        "Description": "This ceremony was always preceded by a full day of the firewalker praying and chanting. Afterwards, they would summon a fire elemental and bestow upon them gifts in the form of food prepared by their own hands and a [[coffer]] made of some precious metal, often times [[copper]], that was full of various [[coin]]s, [[gemstone]]s, and [[jewelry]]. These were said to be carried away by the fire elemental back to the [[Crimson Pillar]], the [[divine realm]] of Kossuth."
