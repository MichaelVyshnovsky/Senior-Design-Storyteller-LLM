        "mainbody": "he Deliverance Unto Darkness was a religious event observed by worshipers of Ibrandul, the Lord of the Dry Depths.\nIbranduls faithful observed this ceremony on Midwinters Eve. They thanked their god for rescuing from the hands of the wicked drow. The sacrifice of a creature sacred to the drow and Lolth, such as a giant spider, was performed along with the casting of the dark path spell. Chains of Ibranduls faithful would then walk through the Underdark, aided by the powers granted by the spell and trusting in Ibrandul to protect them from harm."
