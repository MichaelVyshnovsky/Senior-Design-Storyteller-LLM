==Activities==
The holiday was organized by [[cleric]]s of [[Lliira]], [[Sharess]], and [[Sune]]. During the day, activities included large dancing rings on the streets for all ages, as well as dancing performances. After dusk, the holiday was celebrated with performances by [[bard]]s and minstrels for families, in events known as "love feasts".

Throughout the holiday, traditional sweet treats of all kinds were consumed, ranging from [[chocolate]] to [[red firemint]] [[red firemint candy|candies]].

It was also common for couples to slip away during the evening to kiss and exchange love promises and gifts. The most common tokens that were given this way were [[ring]]s blessed by the clerics with faithfulness prayers.

==History==
During the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]'s campaign against the [[undead]] in [[Chult]], they took the opportunity to celebrate Grand Revel at [[Camp Vengeance]]. However, festivities were somewhat derailed when one of the [[templar]]s, [[Vanessa]], alerted them that a merchant caravan was overdue to arrive at the camp and had likely been lost in the jungle.
