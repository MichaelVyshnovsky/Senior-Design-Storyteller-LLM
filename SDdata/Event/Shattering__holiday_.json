        "mainbody": "The Shattering was a holy day and festival observed by followers of Valkur, the Captain of the Waves.\nThough not set on a specific date, the Shattering was always held in early spring. It was believed that Valkur secretly communicated the festivals date to his High Captains and the date varied from region to region. Valkurs faithful marked the Shattering as the end of winter and the begining of spring, or more importantly, the sailing season in northern lands. The Shattering was still celebrated in southern regions that did not experience the winter ice. A new ship was christened with every Shattering."
