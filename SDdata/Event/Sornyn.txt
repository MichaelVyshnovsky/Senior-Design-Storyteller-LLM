Sornyn () was a three-day-long festival held between Flamerule 3 and Flamerule 5. It was one of twelve High Festivals that celebrated Waukeen. In Waterdeep, the holiday also honored Lathander.
During the three days of the festival, celebrants planned business operations and signed meetings and agreements. It was also common for envoys to be sent and received at different locations, including between enemies and between locations unknown to each other. Copious amounts of wine were consumed during the festival, accompanying all the meetings.
People endeavoring to start a new business or project were encouraged to meet potential partners and funders during this holiday.
On a warm Sornyn evening sometime in the midâ€’14 century DR, the author Volothamp Geddarm signed the agreement to begin writing  Volos Guide to Waterdeep.
