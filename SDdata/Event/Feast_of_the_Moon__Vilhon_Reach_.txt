The '''Feast of the Moon''', also known as the '''Festival of Lovers''', was a celebration held throughout the [[Vilhon Reach]], including [[Sespech]] and [[Turmish]], in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It took place annually at [[Highsummer]]{{Cite polyhedron/101/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Turmish Customers and Festivals|23}} on the first full moon after [[Midsummer]] and lasted the whole night.''The Vilhon Reach: Dungeon Master's Reference'' page 34 says "one night after Midsummer" but this seems in error, losing the information of the first full moon of the earlier ''Polyhedron'' #101 article. After all, people are surely too hungover from Midsummer Night festivities to do it all again the next night.

==Description==
===14{{th}} Century DR===
In the 1300s DR, it was a time of drinking, dancing, revelry, and even debauchery. The night saw much feasting, wild singing, pranks, and people chasing one another through the woods under the moonlight. Friends and lovers came together at this time. Nevertheless, many couples were already married, married in the week before, or married on the night, for it was customary for newlyweds to consummate their marriages on this night too. Outsiders were welcome to join in and some travelers made sure to be in Turmish at the time.

A tradition required that lovers find one another in new and unfamiliar locales. For this night, they would go to a previously arranged place, one that neither had visited before, and travel separately along different routes before meeting up for a tryst. Popular meeting places for lovers in Turmish were [[Evenstar Vale]], [[Faerie Well]], [[Starfall Stream Pool]], the top of [[Bare Bones Hill]], and the shores and hills around the [[Lake of Drifting Stars]].

Although the festival was meant to be carefree, the militias of Turmish were generally especially alert to crime, murder, and reckless behavior that might go on under cover of the chaos and the night.

On this day, businesses and most government offices were closed.

===15{{th}} Century DR===
In the 1400s DR, it was more a time for Turmishans to relax and enjoy their rewards of the last year and to spend time with friends and family. Turmishan merchants made sure to return home in time.
