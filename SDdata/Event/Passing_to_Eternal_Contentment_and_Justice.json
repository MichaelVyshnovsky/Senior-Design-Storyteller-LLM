        "Description": "In this ceremony, the fallen were enshrouded and buried. There were three tiers of such an event, each a ceremony in their own right. Such ceremonies were known as High Passing, Middle Passing, and Low Passing. The High Passing provided funerals for those of royal descent, whereas the Middle Passing carried out burials for the nobles. The lowest tier, the Low Passing, involved burying the commoners of society."
