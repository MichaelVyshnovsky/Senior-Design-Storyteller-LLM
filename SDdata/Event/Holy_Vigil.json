        "Description": "Holy Vigils were observed when a [[priest]] within the [[Church of Helm]] ascended to a higher rank within the clergy. The priest participated in a time of deep concentration where they kept their weapon afloat in the air throughout the night. The weapon was enchanted to float by a fellow priest, but only the ascending priest's constant vigilance kept it afloat through the night."
