        "Activities": "A beastheart would select an [[animal]] species to empathize with during their very first hunt. Choices could include practically any mammalian predator, but common choices included [[bear]]s, [[wolves]], large [[cat]]s, or [[wolverine]]s. Once selected, the blood bond would ensure that the beastheart would never raise a hand to harm a member of the chosen animal species, nor would that type of animal ever harm the beastheart. Members of the selected animal species viewed the beastheart with respect as if they were in the same pack, but they were not the beastheart's companion or [[familiar]]."
