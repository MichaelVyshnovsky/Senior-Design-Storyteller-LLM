The '''Reconsecration''' was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Set]], the Defiler of the Dead within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
This dark ceremony was performed by grave robbers serving Set and particularly infuriated followers of [[Osiris]] and [[Nephthys]]. Set's grave robbers completely defiled their target burial chamber by using it to create a dark altar to Set, looting the treasures found within, and animating the dead into [[undead]].
