The Reconsecration was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of Set, the Defiler of the Dead within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
This dark ceremony was performed by grave robbers serving Set and particularly infuriated followers of Osiris and Nephthys. Sets grave robbers completely defiled their target burial chamber by using it to create a dark altar to Set, looting the treasures found within, and animating the dead into undead.
