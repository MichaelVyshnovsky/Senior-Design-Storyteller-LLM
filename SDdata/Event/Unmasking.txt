The Unmasking was a sacred holy ritual observed by worshipers of Leira, the Lady of the Mists.
This ritual was used as a purification process of novices entering into Leiras clergy, by other priests rising in rank, or as a form of penance for slighting their faith (usually by telling the truth too often). The participant would walk down a column lined with other priests holding tall lit candles that were reflected by pools and mirrors.
