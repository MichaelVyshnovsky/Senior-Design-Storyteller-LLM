        "mainbody": "The Cycle of Night was the recurrent destruction of stars and planets across the cosmos, as carried out by the goddess Shar. The phenomena was a subject of some debate among Sharran scholars and other sages of the Realms.\nWhen carrying out the Cycle of Night, Shar would conjure a shadowstorm that would engulf an entire world, causing all life upon it to wither away. The act was even capable of \"killing\" the star around which a planet orbited.\nOne Sharran relic from the continent of Faerûn on Toril, the 7 century book entitled The Leaves of One Night, was closely linked to the Cycle of Night. The book spoke of a moment in Shars existence that was both that of her \"greatest triumph\" and \"greatest weakness\". Some Sharrans believed believed the former referred to her consumption of the world Toril,\nOne Faerûnian sage theorized that Shars Cycle of Night was an act of self-preservation, as her existence was fed by suffering, loss, and oblivion.\nThe only recorded or witnessed instances of the Cycle of Night occurred on the worlds of Ephyras\nRepeatedly throughout history, Shar designated a divine being on a world that would herald its annihilation by her will. When the moment of destruction arrived, Shar consumed the divinity of her herald and exterminated all life upon the planet, leaving it barren and desolate for all time.\nAs a result of Shars ravenous consumption, the multiverse was dotted with instances of oblivion, where life and civilization once existed.\nOne world that Shar was said to have destroyed was that of Ephyras, a planet that was much older than Toril. Wild magic permeated its surface, and its star remained dying, yet not entirely snuffed out.\nThe earliest record events surrounding the Cycle of Night on Toril occurred 700 years before Dale Reckoning on the Calendar of Harptos. Augathra the Mad began having terrible visions about the future, a number of which were related to Shar. Her prophetic dreams were inscribed within the Book of the Black and the Black Chronology—an alternate timeline adopted by the church of Shar—was formed.\nHundreds of years later, in the , The Leaves of One Night was recovered by Shars followers. The book allowed them to initiate the rites necessary to prepare Toril for Shars consumption.\nBy the following year, Shar was poised to initiate the Cycle of Night on Toril, using the divinity of her son and herald, Mask the God of Thieves. Unwilling to play his role in Shars scheme, Mask hid away portions of his divinity among his two chosen, Erevis Cale and Drasek Riven, and had another part stolen by Shars own chosen Rivalen Tanthul. Shar appeared within the Torillian city of Ordulin, ready to consume the world, she became unable to devour Masks divinity and the Cycle of Night was halted. For over a century, Shar was frozen  as the supernatural phenomenon known as the Ordulin Maelstrom, bound to her holy book, The Leaves of One Night, until the three semi-divine chosen could be slain and cycle resumed.\nThe Cycle of Night on Toril could only be stopped entirely when all the beings that possessed Masks divinity were slain within Shars presence, and her herald Mask was reincarnated as a god. Unfortunately, Erevis Cales portion of godhood had been claimed by the archdevil Mephistopheles, and Rivalen Tanthul rededicated himself to completing Shars cycle.\nIn the , the returned Erevis Cale and his son Vasen ventured to the Ordulin Maelstrom to finally end the Cycle of Night. They arrived at their destination at the same that as Masks other chosen Drasek Riven, who had drawn Mephistopheles from Cania in the Nine Hells with him. Rivalen attempted to force Vasen to read from The Leaves of One Night and complete the Cycle of Night, but the younger Cale resisted, and turned the power invested within The Leaves onto Shar. Erevis severed the divine essence from Masks vessels, and the God of Intrigue was reborn in the body of Drasek Riven."
