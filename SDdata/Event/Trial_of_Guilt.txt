A '''trial of guilt''' was a judicial proceeding that occurred in [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's destruction.

==Activities==
Trials of guilt were decreed by Magistrate [[Osconivon]] when the accuser and the accused were unable to outbid one another with bribes. The accused was sent to the [[Arena (Zhentil Keep)|Arena]] where they would fight to the death against a force selected by Osconivon. Sometimes the accuser was forced to step into the arena to fight the accused. The bribe of the "winner" of the trial was accepted after the contest and appropriate judgment was pronounced.
