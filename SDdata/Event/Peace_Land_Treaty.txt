The '''Peace Land Treaty''' was a treaty between the [[Tabotan]] noble class and the [[Shou]] [[monk]]s and lamas of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] made in {{YearlinkConvert|646|SY}}. It marked the founding of the nation of [[Tabot]].

==History==
When soldiers of [[Shou Lung]] invaded Tabot that year, the tribes of the lowland cities and the remaining priests and monks of the mountain [[monasteries]], who previously had remained secluded, were forced to ally against them. Baron [[Ohn]] of [[Han Chao]] commanded his warriors and the great [[sohei]] [[Ramara]] led a force of monks and together they repelled the Shou in the [[Battle of Tsagang]].

Afterward, Ohn and Ramara negotiated for ten days and established the Peace Land Treaty between the tribes and the monks. It legitimized the monks' hermitages (now mountain keeps) and gave them a role in the defense of the lowland tribes and thereby cemented land and peace, hence its name. Together, they founded a new city, [[Tsagang]], at the place of their victory and founded the new nation of Tabot. All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word.
