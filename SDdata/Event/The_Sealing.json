        "mainbody": "The Sealing was a ritual performed by worshipers of Jergal, the Lord of the End of Everything.\nScriveners of Doom were required to perform the ritual each time they recorded a death, method of death, and destination in the afterlife. The ritual involved sprinkling a mixture of powdered bone and ash over the recently inscribed words to blot the ink. The ritual also signified an additional step toward the end of the world."
