Brightswords was a holiday celebrated in Waterdeep on Eleint 21. It consisted of parades and demonstrations conducted by the citys main military organizations, as well as competitions and staged battles.
The City Watch, the City Guard, and the City Navy conducted parades, demonstrations, and staged battles throughout the day. In addition, contests of skill with wooden weapons were held between veteran soldiers and candidates interested in enlisting.
Boxing and wrestling tournaments between the Wards of Waterdeep were also held during Brightswords. Independent performers also held weapon juggling and throwing displays. During the entire holiday, weapon makers and merchants openly sold their products throughout the city.
At the end of the day, the most anticipated event was an aerial demonstration performed by the Griffon Cavalry. It was held at the Field of Triumph and consisted of staged battles against illusions of enemies provided by the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors over the crowded stadium. Before the show, the surrounding areas were cleared of horses.
