The '''Great Modron March''', sometimes called the '''modron parade''', was a periodic tour of the seventeen [[Outer Planes]] of the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] undertaken by thousands of [[modron]]s once every 289 years.

==Description==
The March occurred every Grand Cycle of Mechanus. A Grand Cycle was the time it took for the largest gear in the plane to turn once and was subdivided into seventeen cycles, each of which took seventeen years. Thus, the March occurred every 289 years.

Thousands of modrons participated in the Great March. The vast majority were [[monodrone]]s, but the voyage also included modrons of higher rank, including hierarchs. A [[quinton]] usually led the entire effort and kept all the records of the voyage. As a consequence of the modron promotion system, a quinton was always present until the very end, as long as at least one modron survived the voyage. A [[hexton]] was in charge of defense, while a [[septon]] was tasked with ensuring that the march progressed smoothly. Four [[octon]]s commanded each one quarter of the full contingent, assisted by [[nonaton]]s. [[Decaton]]s served as liaisons between the base and the hierarch modrons.

At least fifty [[pentadrone]]s patrolled the lower ranks. [[Quadrone]]s served as elite warriors, while [[tridrone]]s and [[duodrone]]s were tasked with herding and carrying out commands to the vast masses of marching monodrones.

==Location==
The itinerary of the March included all sixteen Outer Planes of the Great Wheel and all of the [[gate-town]]s in the [[Outlands]]. Starting from [[Mechanus]], the march departed from [[Regulus]]{{Cite dragon/354/Return of the Modrons|34-35}} and entered the Outlands via the ''[[portal]]'' from [[Automata]]. It then proceeded around the border of the plane in the clockwise direction.

The Great Modron March followed a predictable pattern, moving from one gate-town to the next while in the Outlands and, once in a plane of the Great Wheel, crossing a ''portal'' to the next adjacent plane, subsequently emerging at its corresponding gate-town. The complete itinerary was:
* Automata to [[Fortitude]]
* [[Arcadia]] to [[Mount Celestia]], through [[Abellio]]
* [[Excelsior]] to [[Tradegate]]
* [[Bytopia]] to [[Elysium]], via [[Dothion]] through the location of the [[Golden Hills]] and through [[Amoria]] via the River [[Oceanus]]
* [[Ecstasy]] to [[Faunel]]
* The [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] to [[Arborea]], via [[Krigala]]
* [[Sylvania]] to [[Glorium]]
* [[Ysgard]] to [[Limbo]], via a branch of [[Yggdrasil]]
* [[Xaos (gate-town)|Xaos]] to [[Bedlam]]
* [[Pandemonium]] to the [[Abyss]], via [[Pandesmos]] and through the [[Plain of Infinite Portals]]
* [[Plague-Mort]] to [[Curst (gate-town)|Curst]]
* [[Carceri]] to [[Hades]], exiting [[Othrys]] via [[Undermountain]]
* [[Hopeless]] to [[Torch (gate-town)|Torch]]
* [[Gehenna]] to the [[Nine Hells]], through [[Khalas]]
* [[Ribcage]] to [[Rigus]]
* [[Acheron]] to [[Mechanus]], via the [[Blue Cube]] in [[Avalas]], through the [[Mines of Marsellin]] in [[Thuldanin]], and finally back to Regulus.

==Activities==
The purpose of the Great Modron March was unclear. Some speculated that it consisted of a periodic reconnaissance mission to ascertain the state of the Outer Planes and to report them to [[Primus]]. However, they never investigated any location, nor did they interact with anyone. They simply marched, looking at every new location they visited, and moving on. Others argued that the march was necessary to calibrate the gears of Mechanus, while another group maintained that the purpose of the March was to instill a sense of order in all the planes, even if just temporarily.

==History==
The [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]], after being resurrected, sought to become a deity with the name of Tenebrous. He killed [[Primus]] and temporarily usurped his position, triggering an unscheduled Great March as an attempt to search for the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]''.

[[Ambran|Ambran the Seeker]], a [[half-elven]] [[paladin]] of [[Oghma]] from [[Cormyr]], was sent on a mission to explore the [[planes of existence]], according to his unpublished journal that dated from during the reign of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]. Traveling with [[Glin]], a [[bariaur]] guide hired to take him from [[Sigil]] to the Outlands, Ambran observed the start of the Great Modron March of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]] as the modrons walked out of the Automata ''portal''.According to p. 28 of [[Dragon magazine 204|''Dragon'' #204]], the notes belong to the journal of the paladin [[Ambran]] at the court of [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], whose reign started in {{Yearlink|1336}} according to p. 42 of [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Running the Realms'']]. However, pp. 183‒184 of ''[[Out of the Abyss]]'', which takes place in the early 1490s [[DR]], state that the last Great Modron March took place "over two hundred years ago". If the ''Dragon'' article refers to Ambran as a member of Azoun IV's court, there is a tension of at least 50 years between the two sources regarding the established date of the last Modron March. If, on the other hand, the article refers to the date the journal was found or read, there is no tension.

A group of twelve [[monodrone]]s and one [[tridrone]] became stranded in the [[Labyrinth]] in the [[Underdark]] following the Great March of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. By the late 1480s, the monodrones, having spent over 200 years, had degraded and could barely speak.
