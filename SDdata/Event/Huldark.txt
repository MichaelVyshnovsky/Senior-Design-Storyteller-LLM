'''Huldark''' was an annual [[Waukeenar]] festival celebrated by the church, clergy, and [[Waukeen]]'s worshipers across the Realms on [[Eleasis 17]].

==Description==
The autumn Waukeenar festival was celebrated everywhere where Waukeen was worshiped. The event's goal was to celebrate the fall harvest and bounty of the land brought by hard work. During the festival, worshipers of Waukeen planted new fruit [[tree]]s and vegetables, followed by a feast.
