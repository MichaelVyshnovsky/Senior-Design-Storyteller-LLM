The '''Gilding''' was a rite observed by worshipers of [[Deneir]], the Lord of All Glyphs.

==Activities==
During a Gilding a group of Deneirrath priests gathered in a circle and took turns casting special [[spell]]s on a hovering manuscript. Each spell cast impressed a single large [[gold]]en letter upon the manuscript, eventually writing out the Words of Deneir. The manuscript was then set on display for the public to view. Any [[thieves]] caught trying to steal one of the golden letters were punished severely.
