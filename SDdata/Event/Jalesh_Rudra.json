        "mainbody": "he Jalesh Rudra was a holy celebration of the faithful of Silvanus, celebrated on the night of Tarsakh 19.\nDuring the Jalesh Rudra, priests sought out sacred groves, where they painted each other with the symbols of Silvanus, and made an offering of the leaves of oak, ash, and thorn, preferably over running water. If the celebrants were found worthy, the Oak Fathers favor was shown by allowing the priests to commune (carnally) with the messengers in some cases, magical items or even quests could also be given to the celebrants.\nIt also served as a coming of age ceremony for the faithful."
