            "Preparation": "Prior to ceremony, the clergy of Nephthys prepared and protected tombs that would house the fallen. Defensive wards were set up, the bodies were transported to the burial chambers, and the crypts were sealed.",
            "Event": "The ceremony consisted of casting several spells, such as ''[[sanctify crypt]]'', ''[[enduring ward]]'', and ''[[major curse]]''. The noble, free people would be granted great places to rest and several protective wards, while slaves and commoners would be granted simple graves or group tombs. Despite one's station in life, each of the resting places would be protected with at least a single ward."
