The '''Wild Night''' was an occasional celebration performed by followers of [[Azuth]], the High One.

==Activities==
During a Wild Night, participants would unleash [[wild magic]] and dance in its midst just to feel the raw magical power. A handful of [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s were usually standing by in case anyone was harmed by the unleashed magic.
