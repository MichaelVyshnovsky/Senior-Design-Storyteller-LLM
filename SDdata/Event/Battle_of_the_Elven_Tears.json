        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of the Elven Tears''' was the armed conflict of [[144 DR]], between the [[elves]] of [[Chondalwood]] and the nation of [[Chondath]].",
        "History": "The unrest that eventually led to the faithful Battle of the Elven Tears started in the {{Yearlink|139}}. By then, the [[Emerald Corridor]] cities were actively deforesting Chondalwood, turning it into lumber. The production was halted in the {{Yearlink|143}} by a large contingency of elves who emerged from Chondalwood. Lord [[Anthony Illistine]] used the elves an opportunity to forge an alliance with the [[Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach]] as none of the settlements that would later become Chondath were happy about the halted industry. In the early winter of {{Yearlink|144}}, Anthony Illistine sent the joined army of the Free Cities into Chondalwood to exert dominance over the elves. The armies destroyed the forest city of [[Ariel-than]] with only a few survivors who fled deep into Chondalwood. The total number of slain elves was recorded to be more than two thousand.",
        "Outcome": "The massacre was named the Battle of the Elven Tears. The Free Cities resumed lumber production, and Lord Illistine's influence grew through the region. Within six months after the Battle of the Elven Tears, the Free Cities of [[Arrabar]], [[Mussum]], [[Samra]], and [[Shamph]], joined into the nation of Chondath under the leadership of Governor Illistine."
