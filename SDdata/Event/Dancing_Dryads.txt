The Dancing Dryads was a rare phenomenon that occurred seeming at random and heralded great upheavals in Faerûn.
The Dancing Dryads was an aptly named event when a circle of hauntingly beautiful dancing, laughing, and leaping dryads manifested themselves in Faerûn.
The Dancing Dryads were known to appear throughout the ages and each observer claimed that a period of great upheaval followed in the forest spirits wake. In the late 14 century DR, The Dancing Dryads appeared in the great forest of Chondalwood in the Vilhon Reach. Their pirouettes were observed by the traveling bard named Aglaera Rivenshaun of Chondath, Chessenta, and Turmish.
