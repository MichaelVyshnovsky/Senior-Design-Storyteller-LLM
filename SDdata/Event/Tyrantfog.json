        "mainbody": "The '''Tyrantfog''' was a magical ritual, empowered by [[Iyachtu Xvim]], that [[Fzoul Chembryl]] devised to save his own life. It struck down followers of [[Cyric]] across [[Faerûn]] and allowed Xvim to absorb the power of many [[Bane|Banite]] relics.",
        "Location": "The ritual itself took place at [[Zhentil Keep]], and caused two massive clouds of gray fog to spread across Faerûn. The first spread throughout the [[Moonsea]] and the [[Heartlands]], reaching as far south as [[Starmantle]], as far north as the [[Sunrise Mountains (North Faerûn)|Sunrise Mountains]], and as far east as [[Tsurlagol]]. The second cloud arose around [[Mintar]] and spread northwest to [[Saradush]]. The ritual's effects affected much of the [[Western Heartlands]], western [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], and southeastern [[Tethyr]].",
        "History": {
            "After-effects": "The Tyrantfire's flames became concentrated into a huge pillar of green and black fire over the altar where Fzoul began the ritual. He stood within the flames, unhurt, and released the stored energy within him. Though he did not burn, Fzoul still died once all of the magical energy within him was gone three days later. The massive amount of power released by the ritual was fed to Iyachtu Xvim, however, and in thanks, Xvim resurrected Fzoul as his [[Chosen]] a day afterward.\n\nUpon Fzoul's resurrection, the pillar of fire was transformed into basalt and was quickly made into a grand temple called [[Tor Blackflame]].\n\nAll Banite magic items in [[Myth Drannor]] were consumed by the Tyrantfire but the flames mysteriously coalesced into the form of a [[dragon]] before rejoining the diminishing radius of fire.\n\nAll those who succumbed to the diseases caused by the Tyrantfog rose after the Tyrantfire as [[tyrantfog zombie]]s.\n\nXvim himself was greatly empowered by the ritual, laying the groundwork for Bane's return through him less than two years later."
