The Divinity Plays were a series of performances performed and enjoyed by the Mulhorandi people on Midsummer each year. They were sponsored and organized by the churches of the realm.
Starting at dawn on Midsummer, actors throughout Mulhorand performed a series of plays that memorialized and celebrated their gods. The performances continued all day long until sunset.
Bards and other actors each portrayed the Mulhorandi gods―respectfully, but with humanity―as tradition dictated. The rigidity of Horus-Res outlook on life was scoffed at by other deities Set always orchestrated impractical schemes that failed for his goals, but wound up benefiting Horus-Re.
To the joy of many, the Red Wizards of Thay were depicted as spoiled, incompetent fools.
In the , a new performance entitled The Taking of Unther was added to the Divinity Plays. This play was a reenactment of the fall of Gilgeam and the salvation of the people from Unther.
