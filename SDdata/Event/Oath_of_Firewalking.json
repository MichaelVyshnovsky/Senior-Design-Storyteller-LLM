        "mainbody": "he Oath of Firewalking was a sacred event observed by worshipers of Kossuth, the Lord of Flames.\nAll hopeful priests of Kossuth participated in the Oath of Firewalking upon entering the clergy, earning their very first spells granted by Kossuth upon their completion of the initiation. Priests continued to participate in these oaths as they rose within the ranks of the clergy, proving their loyalty to Kossuth by walking barefoot over burning coals. The heat of the coals, as well as the distance required to walk upon them, increased depending on the relative rank of the participating priest. Anyone performing the Oath of Firewalking who was not utterly devoted to Kossuth risked catching fire and perishing under the heat of the flames."
