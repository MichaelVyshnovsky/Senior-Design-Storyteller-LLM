        "mainbody": "he Tithing was a religious ceremony observed by the clergy of Tiamat, the Dragon Queen within the Untheric pantheon.\nPriests of Tiamat made small daily offerings, usually in the form of a gemstone or coins, to Tiamat. The priests concealed their offering by cupping their hands while uttering a prayer. When the prayer finished there was a chance that the offering would actually vanish from the priests hands, showing a sign of Tiamats blessing."
