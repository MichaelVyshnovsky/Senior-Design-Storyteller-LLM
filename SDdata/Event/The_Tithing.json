        "Description": "[[Priest]]s of Tiamat made small daily offerings, usually in the form of a [[gemstone]] or coins, to Tiamat. The priests concealed their offering by cupping their hands while uttering a prayer. When the prayer finished there was a chance that the offering would actually vanish from the priest's hands, showing a sign of Tiamat's blessing."
