        "mainbody": "he Divine Pageantry was a holy festival observed by the faithful of Siamorphe, the Divine Right.\nThe festival occurred within the Sea Ward and North Ward of Waterdeep. Participants occupied Heroes Walk, Heroes Garden, and the street from Skulls Street all the way to the Street of Glances and the Street of the Singing Dolphin.\nAs most of Siamorphes followers were composed of nobility, the vast majority of participants in the Divine Pageantry were nobles. The festival was held during the summer though never a specific date. Participating nobles dressed in old-fashioned costumes and tossed coins, usually in the form of copper or silver, to spectating commoners. The nobles spoke in stilted speech and addressed each other with full titles during the Divine Pageantry."
