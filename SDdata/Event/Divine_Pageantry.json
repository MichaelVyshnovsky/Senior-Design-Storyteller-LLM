        "mainbody": "The '''Divine Pageantry''' was a holy festival observed by the [[Church of Siamorphe|faithful]] of [[Siamorphe]], the Divine Right.",
        "Location": "The festival occurred within the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] and [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. Participants occupied [[Heroes' Walk]], [[Heroes' Garden]], and the street from [[Skulls Street]] all the way to the [[Street of Glances]] and the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]].",
        "Description": "As most of Siamorphe's followers were composed of nobility, the vast majority of participants in the Divine Pageantry were nobles. The festival was held during the summer though never a specific date. Participating nobles dressed in old-fashioned costumes and tossed coins, usually in the form of [[copper]] or [[silver]], to spectating commoners. The nobles spoke in stilted speech and addressed each other with full titles during the Divine Pageantry."
