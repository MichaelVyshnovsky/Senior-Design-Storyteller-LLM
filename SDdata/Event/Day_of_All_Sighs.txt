The '''Day of All Sighs''' was a holy day observed by worshipers of [[Eshowdow]], the Shadow Giant within the [[Chultan pantheon]].

==Description==
The Day of All Sighs was observed 66 days following the [[Unearthing]], the date of which was not the same from year to year. The [[Eshowe]] would mourn the ancient defeat of Eshowdow by [[Ubtao]] and his [[Tabaxi (tribe)|tabaxi]]. The Eshowe renewed their desire for vengeance on the Dall of All Sighs. [[Shadow binding]]s were commonly performed on this day.
