The '''Omi War''' was a little-known armed conflict that took place in [[Shou Lung]] sometime before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
A legendary [[ninja]] [[Fukio]] was perhaps the most well-known historical figure from the Omi War. The ninja was a master of disguise and became infamous for a successful assassination of the Emperor of Shou Lung of the time. As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, only the [[enchanted]] set of clothes â€“ ''[[Fukio's Silks]]'' reminded people of the Omi War.
