Stoneshar was a holiday celebrated in Waterdeep on Marpenoth 7. Observed by followers of all faiths, the date was associated with starting new projects, avoiding idleness, and doing constructive deeds.
People who begun working on new projects during Stoneshar believed that their work would be blessed during the following year. On the other hand, the common wisdom stated that anyone who remained idle during the holiday were setting themselves up for misfortune and bad luck.
It was even common to encourage children at play to focus their efforts on constructive activities, such as building sand castles, models, or even just digging holes. Stoneshar was considered a good day to begin construction work, such as laying the foundations of a building or digging a cellar.
