'''Waukeentide''' was a holiday observed in [[Waterdeep]] in honor of the [[god]]dess [[Waukeen]]. It consisted of a number of festivals bundled together into a single event.

==Description==
The holiday was held in the form of a series of celebrations that also codified common business practices of Waterdeep, such as a review of the policies of the [[Guilds of Waterdeep]], as well as renewal of guild membership. Businesses also typically stayed open until late and offered promotions to customers during this period.

Some of the celebrations held during Waukeentide included:
* [[Tarsakh 1]]: [[Caravance]], a commemoration of the first trade caravans to reach Waterdeep;
* [[Tarsakh 5]]: [[Goldenight]], a night festival celebrating money and [[gold]];
* [[Tarsakh 7]]: [[Guildsmeet]], a gala festival in which guilds announced their new policies;
* [[Tarsakh 10]]: [[Leiruin]], celebrating Waukeen's punishment of an attempt at deception by [[Leira]].

==History==
The original festival used to be one day long and focused on celebrating Waterdeep's free trade and commerce. It was gradually expanded to include older festivities, to a point where its name was only maintained by force of habit. In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tenday-long festival was already several centuries old.
