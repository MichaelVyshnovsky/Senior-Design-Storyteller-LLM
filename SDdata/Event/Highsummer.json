        "mainbody": "Highsummer was a special day in the Calendar of Harptos, occurring on the first full moon after Midsummer.The Vilhon Reach Dungeon Masters Reference page 34 says \"one night after Midsummer\" but this seems in error, losing the information of the first full moon of the earlier Polyhedron #101 article. The date from the earlier source is adopted here.\nThe night of Highsummer was traditionally the time for the Feast of the Moon or the \"Festival of Lovers\" celebrated in Turmish, Sespech, and across the Vilhon Reach.\nA festival was also held in the city of Ankhapur in the Lake of Steam region. Curiously, on the day before Highsummer each year, every tressym in the city mysteriously disappeared in the night, even from within cages. None knew where they went or why. The winged cats only returned three days later, with people simply seeing them again they when they woke up.\nIn the time of ancient Netheril, the Netherese held festivities on Highsummer. Undead Angardt warriors in Redguard Lake were said to look out of the water on Highsummer and look for kobolds to slay.\nA legendary time gate was said to appear at Highsummer, shining brightly upon Miskens Peak, north of Novularond in the Great Glacier."
