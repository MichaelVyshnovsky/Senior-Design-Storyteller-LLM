The Sagacious Slumber was a religious event observed by devout followers of Sseth, the World Serpent.
This month long period of hibernation was observed by all Ssethsar. The hibernation overlapped with midwinter into the month of Alturiak. The Sagacious Slumber was preceded by a shocking revel where large numbers of living prey, including humans and demihumans, were consumed by the Ssethsar and the serpents under their care. Rebellious slaves were usually the first selections for the revels menu.
