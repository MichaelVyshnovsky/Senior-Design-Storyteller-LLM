        "Description": "Oghma's devout follwers were required to perform this ritual every morning. It involved writing the symbols of Oghma while uttering a silent prayer of loyalty and praise. The symbols were written in the dirt, in ashes on a stone altar, or simply in the worshiper's mind if they were shackled or otherwise unable to physically write."
