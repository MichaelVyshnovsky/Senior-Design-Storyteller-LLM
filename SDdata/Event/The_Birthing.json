        "mainbody": "The Birthing was a holy day observed by worshipers of Hathor, the Nurturing Mother within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThe Birthing occurred annually on the first full moon following Greengrass. Many priestesses of Hathor gave birth around this time, making it a cause of great celebration. Hathor required her priestesses to reveal a new song, dance, or poem during the Birthing provided they were not in the final stages of pregnancy or actually giving birth."
