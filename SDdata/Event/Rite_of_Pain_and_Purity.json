        "mainbody": "he Rite of Pain and Purity was a sacred ceremony observed by worshipers of Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain.\nThe Rite of Pain and Purity was used by Loviatans to celebrate the four main seasonal festivals. During the celebration, clergy members assembled in a circle to dance while singing and chanting and standing upon broken glass, barbed wire, thorns, or other painful objects. Participants were encouraged to greater degrees of revelry at the ends of whips wielded by ranking priests. It was possible for a red ring of radiance to form above the circle, allowing Loviatar to appear to speak of a special mission. The Rite would last for half an hour if Loviatar did not apear, at which point the priests would heal their injuries."
