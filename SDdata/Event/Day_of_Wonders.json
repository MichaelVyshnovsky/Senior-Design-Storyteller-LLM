        "mainbody": "The Day of Wonders was a holiday celebrated in Waterdeep on Marpenoth 3. It featured a display and parade of inventions created by worshipers of Gond.\nThe parade showcased the most recent inventions constructed by the Gondar, many of which were revealed during that day. The inventions ranged from the simplest small devices to enormous autonomous constructs.\nDue to the experimental nature of the inventions on display, it was very common for devices to fail and cause disruptions to the celebrations.\nSometime in the late 15 century DR, one particularly noteworthy device failure during a parade involved a flying chair constructed by Marchell. The chair could ascend indefinitely, but was incapable of descending. Although the inventor was eventually rescued by the Griffon Cavalry, the chair was never recovered."
