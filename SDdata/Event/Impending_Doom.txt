The '''Impending Doom''' was a ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Hoar]], the Doombringer, every [[Marpenoth 11|11{{th}}]] of [[Marpenoth]].

==Activities==
This day-long ceremony involved beating [[drum]]s, making robust oaths, and performing exhaustive acts of purification. The Impending Doom celebrated several aspects of Hoar including acts of both revenge and justice that had yet to be carried out, and good deeds that honored remembered celebrants.
