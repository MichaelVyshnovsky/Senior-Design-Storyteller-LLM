The '''Full Blood''' was a ceremony held by worshipers of [[Garagos]] that initiated a novice into the priesthood.

==Activities==
This religious ceremony could only take place during a [[Blood Festival]]. The supplicant's hands were dipped in blood and the symbol of Garagos was painted on their cheeks. The blood used during the ceremony was that of a dangerous creature slain by the supplicant without the aid of others.
