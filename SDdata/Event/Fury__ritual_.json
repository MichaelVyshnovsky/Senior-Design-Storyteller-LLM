        "mainbody": "The '''Fury''' was a frequent ritual practiced by followers of [[Talos]], the Destroyer.",
        "Activities": "In essence the fury was simply a wild attack on others, or their property, executed by a [[Talassan]] while yelling the name of Talos. The attack began and ended with a prayer to Talos. Typically powerful destructive magic was used to wreak havoc during a short period of time. This was considered a holy feat when a Talassan performed this by themselves, but grouping together with others was also acceptable when faced with a larger area to deal with."
