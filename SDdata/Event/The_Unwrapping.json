        "mainbody": "he Unwrapping was a religious festival observed by worshipers of Geb, the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThe Unwrapping occurred every year on the first of Mirtul in what the Mulhorandi called the \"Time of Melting\" because of the melting of the snows. The diminishment of the winter snow often revealed new caves to explore that hopefully held riches from the earth."
