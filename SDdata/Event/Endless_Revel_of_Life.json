        "Description": "Sharess's followers recognized more celebrations and festivals than any other religion throughout the vast expanse of [[Faerûn]] and these revelries were held throughout the year. All were welcome at these festivals. They celebrated such things as sunrise and sunset each day, the change of seasons, full [[moon]]s, and many other events. Individual festivals had a variety of grandiose names, and new ones always appeared while old ones were forgotten. However, [[Midsummer's Eve]] was the one constant, the greatest time of rejoicing and pursuit of pleasure."
