        "mainbody": "he Endless Revel of Life was the collective name for all of the religious festivals observed by the clergy of Sharess.\nSharesss followers recognized more celebrations and festivals than any other religion throughout the vast expanse of Faer√ªn and these revelries were held throughout the year. All were welcome at these festivals. They celebrated such things as sunrise and sunset each day, the change of seasons, full moons, and many other events. Individual festivals had a variety of grandiose names, and new ones always appeared while old ones were forgotten. However, Midsummers Eve was the one constant, the greatest time of rejoicing and pursuit of pleasure."
