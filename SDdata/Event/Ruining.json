        "Description": "{{fq\n| text = I crawled... to the street, but it was too deep in ash&mdash;hot ash&mdash;for me to plow along it. And the stones were falling thick. I saw more than one person crushed under a fiery boulder. The buildings, strong as they seemed, provided no shelter. Those who hid inside were buried under rubble or chased out by the fires&mdash;everywhere were fires. The air was too thick to breathe.\n| source = [[Artemis Entreri]] describing the Ruining, [[1463 DR]].\n}}\nThe northern peak of the Mount Hotenow volcano exploded, sending a pyroclastic flow of superheated ash, fiery boulders, and lava directly into the city of Neverwinter. Buildings and people alike were consumed by flames, creating streams of ash and blood. Lava flowed into the city via the [[Neverwinter River]], transforming the water into hissing steam as hot as a [[forge]] before becoming just lava. Falling boulders easily demolished homes, and the air was filled with hot ash and searing gas that could incinerate flesh. Much of the city was burned to the ground and half of the population died in an instant.\n\nThe eruption also triggered a massive shockwave that caused some of Neverwinter's districts to sink and others to rise, creating steep cliffs within the city. Most surviving structures were those which were heavily or [[magic]]ally reinforced, such as military fortifications, public buildings, or the homes of powerful [[wizard]]s or wealthy [[noble]]s. The many collapsed buildings broke and clogged the city's catacombs and sewers, turning them into a twisting underground maze that threatened to collapse further.{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Vecna: Nest of the Eldritch Eye}} When sewer tunnels did collapse, they created trenches running through the ruins which served as convenient highways for monsters.",
        "Locations": {
            "Neverwinter": "[[File:Mike Schley Neverwinter vertical.png|thumb|300px|''A map of Neverwinter from three decades following the eruption.'']]\nSome districts of Neverwinter were hit harder than others, with the western neighborhoods (located further from the quaking mountain) tending to fare better.",
            "Other Settlements": "The destruction wrought by the eruption was mostly confined to Neverwinter, although it had far reaching consequences for other parts of the region. The eruption devastated the town of [[Thundertree]]&mdash;which was quickly abandoned before coming to be haunted by possessed [[plant creature]]s&mdash;and it erased the county of [[Corlinn Hill]]. Meanwhile, [[Helm's Hold]] was battered, but it endured and strove to continue serving as a place of healing for survivors. Its sturdy [[Cathedral of Helm]] was unharmed.",
            "Mount Hotenow": "[[File:Concept Hotenow HighLevel.jpg|thumb|''Mount Hotenow following the eruption.'']]\nThe northernmost of the volcano's two peaks was completely gone after the eruption, Both Mount Hotenow and the foothills north of Thundertree were sundered, and the shattering of the igneous rock around the volcano ended up revealing forgotten [[dwarf|dwarven]] passages and ruins, such as [[Fireguard Fortress]].",
            "Neverwinter Wood": "The shockwave from the eruption leveled parts of [[Neverwinter Wood]] The forest recovered with startling speed, however the scars of the eruption remained clear. The woods on the slopes of Mount Hotenow were completely incinerated&mdash;alongside nearly every [[dryad]] living there&mdash;leaving behind blackened husks that came to be called the [[Charred Wood]]. The Neverwinter River was overrun with lava and remained clogged with ash for months.",
            "Shadowfell": "Mount Hotenow's explosion also caused its [[Mount Hotenow (Shadowfell)|counterpart]] in the [[Shadowfell]] to erupt. it also did not stop: decades later, a river of lava continued to stream through Evernight and the surrounding forest had become the ever-aflame [[Burning Woods]]. Some feared that the ongoing eruption in the Shadowfell might trigger another eruption on the [[Material Plane]], which threatened to tear open the barrier between the two [[planes]]."

Nearly all survivors fled the ruined city, heading south as refugees,\n\nNotable survivors included: \n* [[Herzgo Alegni]], who survived by escaping into the Shadowfell.\n* [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who was not present in Neverwinter but witnessed the eruption from afar.\n* [[Artemis Entreri]], who survived by wedging himself beneath the Winged Wyvern Bridge before escaping the city via the sewers.\n* [[Emmek Frewn]], who fled the ruined city to Waterdeep with his parents and sisters.\n* [[Jelvus Grinch]], who would become the \"First Citizen\" among the survivors who resettled the ruins.\n* [[Heartleaf]], the only dryad to survive the obliteration of the woodlands on the slopes of Mount Hotenow.\n*The [[Vannath]] family, who fled to [[Baldur's Gate]] and married into that city's [[patriar]] class."

        "History": {
            "Causes": "Unbeknownst to all but a few, the eruption had not been a natural occurrence: it was caused by the intentional awakening of [[Maegera]], a massive fiery [[primordial]] sleeping beneath the forges of Gauntlgrym under Mount Hotenow. This creature had been imprisoned there centuries prior in a concerted effort by the [[wizard]] [[Maerin]] of [[Illusk]] with the dwarves of [[Delzoun]] and the [[elf|elves]] of [[Iliyanbruen]], but was forgotten after Gauntlgrym was abandoned in the {{YearlinkName|-111}}. Maegera remained comatose thanks to a magical network stemming from the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in Illusk, which used sea water and [[water elemental]]s to keep its power in check. and the disruptions of magic caused during the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the stage was set for the primordial to be awakened.\n\nIn late summer of the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] sought to take advantage of minor tremors that had rattled the region for months and create a mass casualty event in order to empower the [[necromancy]] at their [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] in Neverwinter Wood. Their local leader, [[Sylora Salm]], plotted alongside [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and the [[Ashmadai]] to do this by releasing Maegera from beneath Mount Hotenow, which required manipulating a dwarf of Delzoun heritage into awakening it. To that end, a small adventuring party consisting of Dahlia, [[Korvin Dor'crae]], [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], [[Athrogate]], and [[Jarlaxle]] rediscovered ancient Gauntlgrym and made their way way to the legendary forges. There, the latter two were betrayed by their Thayan allies, with Athrogate hypnotically forced to activate the forge, which began the process of awakening the primordial Maegera.\n\nAfter the party fled the [[dungeon]], a plume of smoke began to rise above Mount Hotenow as the primordial freed itself from the last of the water elementals that had kept it in check. In a fit of bloodlust and rage, it triggered the eruption of the volcano.",
            "Eruption": "One of Mount Hotenow's two peaks appeared to lift into the air before being hurtled with purposeful, malicious accuracy directly at nearby Neverwinter. From the ground, the initial explosion of the mountain was eerily silent as it was clearly visible from across the region well before the sound&mdash;and shockwave&mdash;arrived. Screams and cries for loved ones began to ring out in Neverwinter as people spotted the plume before all was drowned out by the roar of the explosion and the raining fire. The actual destruction of Neverwinter was short and sudden, and left the city as a silent, gray wasteland. Both the air and the ground were choked with hot ash, making it hard for survivors to escape.\n\n{{fq\n| text = Might be that they’re not so smart in putting Neverwinter back where it was. Them quakes’re startin’ again.\n| source = [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], [[1462 DR]].\n}}\nLuckily for the region beyond Neverwinter, this proved to be only a partial awakening of the primordial, which soon returned to its slumber beneath the forges of Gauntlgrym.
