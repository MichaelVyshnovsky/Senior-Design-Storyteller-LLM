        "mainbody": "The Ruining, also known as the Cataclysm or simply the eruption of Mount Hotenow,The proper names \"the Ruining\" and \"the Cataclysm\" appear only in the 2013 game Neverwinter. Other canon sources refer to this event as either a/the \"cataclysm\", \"the eruption of Mount Hotenow\", or \"when Mount Hotenow erupted\". was the destruction of the city of Neverwinter when Mount Hotenow erupted at the end of the summer of the . It was the defining event of the 15 century DR in the history of Neverwinter.\nThe northern peak of the Mount Hotenow volcano exploded, sending a pyroclastic flow of superheated ash, fiery boulders, and lava directly into the city of Neverwinter. Buildings and people alike were consumed by flames, creating streams of ash and blood. Lava flowed into the city via the Neverwinter River, transforming the water into hissing steam as hot as a forge before becoming just lava. Falling boulders easily demolished homes, and the air was filled with hot ash and searing gas that could incinerate flesh. Much of the city was burned to the ground and half of the population died in an instant.\nThe eruption also triggered a massive shockwave that caused some of Neverwinters districts to sink and others to rise, creating steep cliffs within the city. Most surviving structures were those which were heavily or magically reinforced, such as military fortifications, public buildings, or the homes of powerful wizards or wealthy nobles. The many collapsed buildings broke and clogged the citys catacombs and sewers, turning them into a twisting underground maze that threatened to collapse further. When sewer tunnels did collapse, they created trenches running through the ruins which served as convenient highways for monsters.\nthumb|300px|A map of Neverwinter from three decades following the eruption.\nSome districts of Neverwinter were hit harder than others, with the western neighborhoods (located further from the quaking mountain) tending to fare better. \nThe southeastern quadrant of the city was perhaps the hardest hit this was where the earth shifted so violently as to open the Chasm, which swallowed the Arcanist Quarter and left the whole area as a broken maze of ruins. The cathedral of Mystra fell into the Chasm, alongside the nearby Apprentice Row. Two other nearby structures&mdashan army post and the fortified home of Roderick the Wary&mdashremained perched perilously on the Chasms edge.\nThe noble mansions of the northwestern Blacklake District were largely left standing thanks in part to their sturdy (and sometimes magically reinforced) construction, however the lives of the districts residents were not spared in the fires. The Blacklake itself became so choked with ash that it was little more than a pond of sludge.\nThe House of a Thousand Faces survived, but was abandoned in the immediate aftermath.\nThe citys southwestern quarter remained comparatively intact. Of the three bridges spanning the Neverwinter River, only the Winged Wyvern Bridge survived while the Dolphin and Sleeping Dragon bridges were destroyed.\nCastle Never was hit hard by the quakes and fires, leaving parts of it toppled and most of its inhabitants dead. However, the Castles catacombs—known as the Neverneath—were left strangely intact.\nUpheavals in the Neverdeath cemetery altered its elevation, causing mausoleums to collapse and graves to spill open.\nThe docks were destroyed and the whole harbor was swamped with tidal waves, leaving submerged buildings and drowned corpses blocking any access by ship. As such, the city docks were left flooded, rotting, and abandoned. The earthmote upon which the Moonstone Mask was located became untethered from the ground and floated out to sea for several days.\nThe northeastern districts were destroyed, although the area boasted many hidden underground cellars and chambers that remained sealed and untouched. The Merchant Guild Hall and Merchant Square survived mostly intact, but were utterly abandoned afterward. The merchants homes on nearby Waukeen Way were not so lucky, with very few left standing.\nThe destruction wrought by the eruption was mostly confined to Neverwinter, although it had far reaching consequences for other parts of the region. The eruption devastated the town of Thundertree&mdashwhich was quickly abandoned before coming to be haunted by possessed plant creatures&mdashand it erased the county of Corlinn Hill. Meanwhile, Helms Hold was battered, but it endured and strove to continue serving as a place of healing for survivors. Its sturdy Cathedral of Helm was unharmed. \nthumb|Mount Hotenow following the eruption.\nThe northernmost of the volcanos two peaks was completely gone after the eruption, Both Mount Hotenow and the foothills north of Thundertree were sundered, and the shattering of the igneous rock around the volcano ended up revealing forgotten dwarven passages and ruins, such as Fireguard Fortress.\nThe shockwave from the eruption leveled parts of Neverwinter Wood The forest recovered with startling speed, however the scars of the eruption remained clear. The woods on the slopes of Mount Hotenow were completely incinerated&mdashalongside nearly every dryad living there&mdashleaving behind blackened husks that came to be called the Charred Wood. The Neverwinter River was overrun with lava and remained clogged with ash for months.\nMount Hotenows explosion also caused its counterpart in the Shadowfell to erupt. it also did not stop decades later, a river of lava continued to stream through Evernight and the surrounding forest had become the ever-aflame Burning Woods. Some feared that the ongoing eruption in the Shadowfell might trigger another eruption on the Material Plane, which threatened to tear open the barrier between the two planes.\nWhat remained of Neverwinter initially descended into utter chaos and most survivors fled. The city would struggle for decades to rebuild and the ruins soon become bait for unscrupulous adventurers and necromancers. \nAsh zombies roamed the region in the eruptions aftermath, apparently animated by the fell magics released by the eruption. These zombies attacked the survivors in Neverwinter&mdashcontributing to the danger of clearing the ruins where the eruption had created corpses&mdashand overran the remains of Thundertree. It didn’t take long for Thayan necromancers to begin creating more ash zombies.\nThe Sword Coast North as a whole suffered for the loss of Neverwinter, becoming a more dangerous and dark place. Overland trade in the region mostly dried up and the High Road north of Waterdeep fell into disuse and disrepair. The cataclysm also served to dispel many orcish superstitions about Neverwinter Wood, leading to an increase in orc activity in the region, notably an incursion into the Neverwinter ruins by troops from Many-Arrows led by Vansi Bloodscar.\nThousands of people died in the cataclysm, commoner and noble alike. Their bodies came to be buried either wherever space could be found or in mass graves in Neverdeath Graveyard, or else they became fodder for carrion birds and necromancers.\nNotable casualties included\n* The Alagondar royal family, who perished at Castle Never alongside all of their servants.\n* Hugo Babris, the lord in charge of running Neverwinter.\n* The Hallix family, who were eventually interred in their family mausoleum in Neverdeath Graveyard.\nAmong those who survived, some went mad from the pain and grief. Nearly all survivors fled the ruined city, heading south as refugees,\nNotable survivors included \n* Herzgo Alegni, who survived by escaping into the Shadowfell.\n* Drizzt DoUrden, who was not present in Neverwinter but witnessed the eruption from afar.\n* Artemis Entreri, who survived by wedging himself beneath the Winged Wyvern Bridge before escaping the city via the sewers.\n* Emmek Frewn, who fled the ruined city to Waterdeep with his parents and sisters.\n* Jelvus Grinch, who would become the \"First Citizen\" among the survivors who resettled the ruins.\n* Heartleaf, the only dryad to survive the obliteration of the woodlands on the slopes of Mount Hotenow.\n*The Vannath family, who fled to Baldurs Gate and married into that citys patriar class.\nUnbeknownst to all but a few, the eruption had not been a natural occurrence it was caused by the intentional awakening of Maegera, a massive fiery primordial sleeping beneath the forges of Gauntlgrym under Mount Hotenow. This creature had been imprisoned there centuries prior in a concerted effort by the wizard Maerin of Illusk with the dwarves of Delzoun and the elves of Iliyanbruen, but was forgotten after Gauntlgrym was abandoned in the . Maegera remained comatose thanks to a magical network stemming from the Host Tower of the Arcane in Illusk, which used sea water and water elementals to keep its power in check. and the disruptions of magic caused during the Spellplague in the , the stage was set for the primordial to be awakened.\nIn late summer of the , the Red Wizards of Thay sought to take advantage of minor tremors that had rattled the region for months and create a mass casualty event in order to empower the necromancy at their Dread Ring in Neverwinter Wood. Their local leader, Sylora Salm, plotted alongside Dahlia Sinfelle and the Ashmadai to do this by releasing Maegera from beneath Mount Hotenow, which required manipulating a dwarf of Delzoun heritage into awakening it. To that end, a small adventuring party consisting of Dahlia, Korvin Dorcrae, Valindra Shadowmantle, Athrogate, and Jarlaxle rediscovered ancient Gauntlgrym and made their way way to the legendary forges. There, the latter two were betrayed by their Thayan allies, with Athrogate hypnotically forced to activate the forge, which began the process of awakening the primordial Maegera.\nAfter the party fled the dungeon, a plume of smoke began to rise above Mount Hotenow as the primordial freed itself from the last of the water elementals that had kept it in check. In a fit of bloodlust and rage, it triggered the eruption of the volcano.\nOne of Mount Hotenows two peaks appeared to lift into the air before being hurtled with purposeful, malicious accuracy directly at nearby Neverwinter. From the ground, the initial explosion of the mountain was eerily silent as it was clearly visible from across the region well before the sound&mdashand shockwave&mdasharrived. Screams and cries for loved ones began to ring out in Neverwinter as people spotted the plume before all was drowned out by the roar of the explosion and the raining fire. The actual destruction of Neverwinter was short and sudden, and left the city as a silent, gray wasteland. Both the air and the ground were choked with hot ash, making it hard for survivors to escape.\nLuckily for the region beyond Neverwinter, this proved to be only a partial awakening of the primordial, which soon returned to its slumber beneath the forges of Gauntlgrym. In its fitful sleep, earthquakes continued to wrack the region, and began getting particularly severe in the . However, the ancient mechanism and magics that had long held the primordial in stasis were permanently damaged, Even so, the mighty primordial had become much more active, and would once again nearly escape its bonds in the summer of the , causing a great quake around Mount Hotenow.\nThe eruption disrupted the operations of several factions in the region. The Netherese had successfully infiltrated Neverwinters government as they searched for the ruins of Xinlenal, but were forced to withdraw for nearly a decade.\nThe potent magic released by Maegeras awakening continued to permeate the region for decades.\nAfter decades of absence following the Spellplague, the Tower of Twilight began sporadically reappearing following the eruption.\nthumb|300px|A map of Neverwinter from twelve years following the eruption.\nWhile most survivors fled the city immediately following its destruction, a few attempted to reclaim the ruins. as well as by the horrors from the Chasm. This soon led to the initial construction of a fortification known as The Wall out of the rubble and detritus to protect their Settlers Enclave, as well as the formation of a militia known as the Neverwinter Guard. The first leader to emerge amidst these survivors was a man named Jelvus Grinch.\nNeverwinter was a largely desperate and lawless place for several years.\nAs the city was slowly rebuilt, it became a patchwork of slums, new construction, and the broken remnants of the old city. The first district to be rebuilt was a southwestern portion that had been relatively lightly damaged by the eruption, and which came to be called the Protectors Enclave when it was completed in the . From there, Dagult Neverembers \"New Neverwinter\" movement was spearheaded. and by the , people had begun returning to the city to help rebuild and to open new businesses. The docks were also largely restored (at the cost of cutting down every tree on the nearby Upland Rise for lumber), allowing trade to resume. despite massive ongoing reconstruction efforts that resulted in a forest of scaffolding throughout the city.\nIt was not until the , that the Chasm was closed, trade along the High Road had resumed, and Neverwinter began to thrive once more. Castle Never was still undergoing repairs as late as the ."
