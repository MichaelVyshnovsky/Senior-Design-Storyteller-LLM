The '''Second Sundering''', also known as the '''Sundering of Toril and Abeir''',<ref> was a great catastrophic event in the history of the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], that took place during the decade of the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]].
{{Quote|The gods are stirring, mark my words, and in a way we've never seen before. The wars? The way powers who were content to bide their time have all leaped at each others' throats?―if that isn't the hand of the gods moving things, I don't know what is.|The [[Harper]] [[Tharra (Harper)|Tharra]].}}

==Prelude==
When [[Ao]] the [[Overgod]] destroyed the [[Tablets of Fate]] at the conclusion of the [[Time of Troubles]], he instigated the [[Era of Upheaval]]. The Tablets defined the laws of [[Realmspace]] and kept it relatively stable. Without them, chaos ensued and the worlds of Abeir and Toril, separated many thousands of years ago, slowly started to overlap. The [[Spellplague]] drastically sped up this process.{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAoq-vwWHHg|title=What is the Sundering? (Part 1)|accessmonthday=September 7th|accessyear=2017|author=[[Ed Greenwood]],  [[Erin M. Evans]], [[Paul S. Kemp]], [[R.A. Salvatore]], [[Richard Lee Byers]], [[Troy Denning]], [[James Wyatt]] |date=August 21th, 2012}}

The Second Sundering started with Ao's decision to recreate the Tablets of Fate, and to separate the worlds of Abeir and Toril once more. The [[deities]] were unsure of what this would do to them and their power, and made efforts using their most powerful servants to prepare for that event.{{cite web|url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140327123608/http://paulskemp.com/blog/the-sundering/|title = The Sundering|author = [[Paul S. Kemp]]|date = 2012-08-20|accessdate = 2016-12-13}}

The Second Sundering was somehow connected to the [[First Sundering]] that took place around {{Yearlink|-17600}}, when an [[elven]] [[High Magic]] [[ritual]] went both forward and backward in time to create [[Evermeet]]; and with a prehistoric cataclysm known as the [[Tearfall]], that took place in {{Yearlink|-31000}}.

==Timeline==
=== –17,600 DR ===
Around [[-17,600 DR]], the elf [[Elliandreth]] of [[Orishaar]] wrote a [[Eliandreth's prophecy|prophecy]] concerning the events of the Second Sundering.See the prologue of each novel in [[The Sundering (series)|The Sundering series]].

===1482 DR===
{{main|1482 DR}}

[[Abdel Adrian]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], son of [[Bhaal]], was attacked by his last remaining [[Bhaalspawn|sibling]], and as one slew the other, the Lord of Murder returned to life, reclaiming the portfolio of murder from [[Cyric]].

===1484 DR===
{{main|1484 DR}}
{{Quote|''When the trials begin,<br />in soul-torn solitude despairing,<br />the hunter waits alone.<br />The companions emerge<br />from fast-bound ties of fate<br />uniting against a common foe.''|The first stanza of Elliandreth's prophecy.}}
Most of the [[god]]s created many [[Chosen]] among mortals, trying to gather as much power as possible to be as high in divine ranking as they could before Ao completed the new Tablets of Fate, sealing their status and portfolio.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One| topicid    = 19841| postid     = 464851| whichpage  = 7| date       = 2015-02-13| accessdate = }} People started to claim they had been "chosen" by the gods and granted special powers, some apparently for "divine purposes" while others had no idea why.

In [[Mulhorand]], the appearance of the Chosen allowed the old [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] to manifest again on Toril and to come to the aid of their people, who had become second-class citizens in [[High Imaskar]], and believed they had once more been enslaved by their ancient masters, the [[Imaskari]]. With the aid of the [[wizard]] [[Nezram]], the Mulhorandi started a [[Mulhorandi rebellion|rebellion]].

The [[Sembia]]n armies of [[Netheril]] marched on the [[Dalelands]], conquering [[Archendale]]. The Sembians then blocked the road between [[Daerlun]] and [[Cormyr]] and massed all along the borders of the Dalelands.

{{Quote|''When the shadows descend,<br />in Hell-sworn covenant unswerving<br />the blighted brothers hunt,<br />and the godborn appears,<br />in rose-blessed abbey reared,<br />arising to loose the godly spark.''|The second stanza of the prophecy}}
[[Erevis Cale]]'s son [[Vasen Cale|Vasen]] and his companions [[Orsin]] and [[Gerak]] were transported to [[Cania]] by [[Drasek Riven]], where they freed Erevis from his one-hundred-year-long magical imprisonment. [[Mask]] then returned to the Realms through his Chosen, Riven, and acted to put an end to [[Shar]]'s Cycle of Night. About a century before those events, she had ordered the opening of a [[Gate|planar rift]] to the [[Plane of Shadow]] over the city of [[Ordulin]] (destroying it), to create a whirlpool of shadowstuff that would have allowed her to finally destroy Toril. Her plan had failed due to being imprisoned there by Mask, but she had slowly managed to tear a hole in the whirlpool, coming close to fulfilling her goal. However, the concerted efforts of Vasen Cale—who wielded the power of [[Amaunator]]—and of the returned Mask, closed the tear. The flying [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Sakkors]] that rested on top of the maelstrom crashed through the efforts of [[Magadon Kest]] in order to destroy the whirlpool itself. The Netherese princes [[Brennus Tanthul]] and [[Rivalen Tanthul]], Shar's Nightseer, were killed by the falling city. Even though the shroud over Sembia remained, sunlight finally started to reach the surface through the cracks created by the destruction of Sakkors.

Meanwhile, the [[drow]] began to cloud the skies over the [[Silver Marches]] through a ritual known as the [[Darkening]], preparing the battlefield for their sunlight-hating warriors. A large army of [[orc]]s and drow, supported by [[frost giant]]s and [[white dragon]]s, then assaulted the Silver Marches in the [[War of the Silver Marches]]. [[Nesmé]] was destroyed by an orc horde guided by [[Tiago Baenre]] riding the white dragon [[Arauthator]]. [[Sundabar]] was conquered by an orc army commanded by the warlord [[Hartusk]] and renamed Hartusk Keep.

A series of unusual natural disasters hit [[Faerûn]], including an earthquake in [[Iriaebor]], a plague of locusts in [[Amn]], and droughts in the southern lands, leading to receding sea levels and increasing conflict.

===1485 DR===
{{main|1485 DR}}
The Chosen of [[Auril]] started a war with [[Ten-Towns]] in [[Icewind Dale]], and was defeated. A rebellion of the subjugated [[Bedine]] people in [[Anauroch]] against their Netherese masters began when they saw that Netherese forces were spread thin due to [[shade]]s' conflict with Cormyr.

Meanwhile, the War of the Silver Marches continued. The [[Battle of Midwinter]] took place in the [[Cold Vale]] between forces of [[Citadel Felbarr]] and [[Many-Arrows]]; the [[Battle of Silver Arrows]] took place in [[Luruar]] between an orc caravan of Many-Arrows and a group of [[Knights in Silver]]; and the orcs finally besieged [[Silverymoon]]. However, in [[Flamerule]] the siege was broken and the War of the Silver Marches ended, when Hartusk was defeated and the Darkening dispelled.

Towards the end of 1485 DR, the "[[Great Rain]]" began to fall continuously around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

===1486 DR===
{{main|1486 DR}}
The "Great Rain" caused the waters to rise around the Sea of Fallen Stars, consuming much land, but it stopped by the end of the year. as well as some earthmotes in other areas, such as the [[Heart of Ubtao]], in [[Chult]].

During this year, most of the [[primordial]]s living in Toril, among them [[Akadi]], left for their original world of Abeir.

The orcs of Many-Arrows were defeated, while [[Myth Drannor]] came to the aid of the Dalelands in their conflict against Netherese-controlled Sembia. The [[Arcane Brotherhood]] and [[Hosttower of the Arcane]] returned to power in [[Luskan]]. The Netherese besieged [[Arabel]] and [[Suzail]], but Cormyr managed to repel both Netherese and Sembian forces by the end of the year, and [[Neverwinter]] and [[Waterdeep (city)|Waterdeep]] began to clear the rubble in their cities that had built up over a century of neglect.

{{Quote|''When the tempest is born,<br />as storm-tossed waters rise uncaring,<br />the promised hope still shines.<br />And the reaver beholds<br />the dawn-born chosen's gaze,<br />transforming the darkness into light.''|The fourth stanza of the prophecy}}
Many of the Chosen prisoners of Netheril, aided by [[Harper]] agents, freed themselves from the special prison the shades had constructed for them amidst the [[Lost Peaks]]. Among them was [[Stedd Whitehorn]], a young boy who had been chosen by [[Lathander]]. As the Morning Lord returned to the Realms during this year, he tasked Stedd with traveling across Faerûn and announcing his return. During Stedd's eventful travels, he attracted the attention of many foes, most notable among them the [[plaguechanged|bluefire madness-affected]] god [[Nobanion]]. Subjugated by [[Malar]], Nobanion was sent to capture the Chosen of Lathander, but the power of the young boy managed to heal the Lion God of the bluefire corruption instead. Grateful for his freedom, Nobanion accompanied Stedd on his path through the wilds of [[Gulthandor]].

{{Quote|''When the battle is lost,<br />through quake-tossed battlefields unwitting<br />the seasoned legions march,<br />but the sentinel flees<br />with once-proud royalty,<br />protecting devotion’s fragile heart.''|The fifth stanza of the prophecy}}
Meanwhile, a new plan of Shar threatened to bring the [[Shadowfell]] into the Realms via the [[Underchasm]]. [[Kleef Kenric]], Chosen of the (presumed) dead god [[Helm]], Lady [[Arietta Seasilver]], Chosen of [[Siamorphe]], and [[Joelle Emmeline]], the Chosen of [[Sune]], banded together to put an end to it. Prince [[Yder Tanthul]] was slain in battle against Kleef. Lady Arietta and her companions convinced the primordial [[Grumbar]] to remain in the Realms and block Shar's plan by filling the chasm with earth. Joelle sacrificed herself to seal the pact with Grumbar, and the Underchasm was filled in to its former borders before the Spellplague in the process. At the same time, Helm returned to the Realms due to the faith of his Chosen Kleef. Lady Seasilver, by then Grand Duchess of [[Marsember]], and Kleef Kenric then returned home.

On [[Nightal]], some places of Abeir that had been part of Toril in the last century and viceversa were restored to their original worlds. [[Unther]] was returned to Toril by this process. While in Abeir, Unther had succumbed to the domination of the creatures native to that world. However, a reincarnated [[Gilgeam]] had led his people against their new oppressors, until their land was shifted back to Toril. Once there, Gilgeam immediately went against the [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]] to take back all of Unther's ancestral land, starting the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]].

The Untherite god [[Enlil]] also returned to Toril on Nightal, but he chose the dragonborn as his new protégés instead of the Untherans, manifesting in the shape of one of them in the citadel-city of [[Djerad Thymar]]. It was Enlil who allowed most of Tymanther to remain in Toril, stopping the magic of the Sundering to some degree.

===1487 DR===
{{main|1487 DR}}

Stars reportedly fell from the sky, gods long thought dead walked the land and armies led by Chosen clashed everywhere. Major geological instability resulted in numerous earthquakes and volcanoes, as the worlds of Abeir and Toril were separated once again, and areas once consumed by large chasms were restored to their pre-Spellplague status. Ships arrived on the mainland continent from Evermeet, [[Halruaa]], [[Lantan]], and [[Nimbral]]—all realms previously thought lost to Toril.

Thanks to the efforts of [[Farideh]], Chosen of [[Asmodeus]], [[Kepeshkmolik Dumuzi]], Chosen of Enlil, and the sacrifice of the [[War Wizard of Cormyr|War Wizard]] [[Ilstan Nyaril]], Chosen of [[Azuth]], the gods Asmodeus and Azuth became separate deities again. Due to a pact between Enlil and Asmodeus, the ancient Untherite god [[Nanna-Sin]] was resurrected as an immortal [[dragon turtle]] (instead of as a god). This allowed the dragonborn and their allies to win the Tymanther-Unther War with a decisive victory, and the Untherans were forced to flee from dragonborn lands, having retrieved just a few of their former territories.

Likewise, the Mulhorandi rebellion against the High Imaskari ended shortly thereafter, with a victory for the rebels. The defeated fled to the [[Plains of Purple Dust]] or to extraplanar safeholds. After that, the Mulhorandi gods remained as the rulers of the Mulan people, retaining the Imaskari laws that prohibited slavery and ending that scourge that had long plagued the most ancient of the [[Old Empires]].

In [[Marpenoth]], [[Larloch]] started a plot to become the new deity of magic by draining the [[wards of Candlekeep]] and the [[mythal]] of Myth Drannor. Meanwhile, Telamont Tanthul, who had become the Chosen of Shar, continued his work for the Lady of Loss, seeking to destroy the Chosen of the other deities, and also planning to drain the mythal of the City of Song. The goal was to use its power to transform the [[Weave]] into a new [[Shadow Weave]]. Intending to move the [[Shade (city)|Shade]] enclave to [[Cormanthor]] and to use a ritual devised by Prince [[Draethren Tanthul]], he hired mercenaries and monsters to support the Netherese forces, and sent agents to kill the [[baelnorn]]s of Myth Drannor.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to fully restore the goddess [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] and the Weave, [[Elminster Aumar]] began his search for [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s writings on the Weave, heading towards [[Candlekeep]]. [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral]] and [[Alustriel Silverhand]] had also been hiding within the library: the two sisters' duty was to prepare their own destruction, so that no one could use their power to gain control over the Weave.

The power of the Wards had also attracted other factions to Candlekeep, and many—namely, the [[Red Wizards]], the Netherese, and the [[Moonstars]]—had sent their agents, masquerading as monks, to keep an eye on them. When Elminster reached Candlekeep, the Netherese sleeper-agents attacked the other monks to gain control of the library, but a large number of them had already been replaced by agents of the other factions, leading to a battle for the Wards. Elminster managed to trick the Netherese by masquerading as High Prince Tanthul, but he, Laeral, and Alustriel were in turn tricked by Larloch, who pretended to wish to use the energies of the Wards to strengthen the Weave. Instead, the energies of the destroyed Wards were absorbed by the Shadow King, who then left for Myth Drannor, followed by the three Chosen of Mystra.

{{Quote|''When the ending draws near,<br />with ice-locked stars unmoving,<br />the threefold threats await,<br />and the herald proclaims,<br />in war-wrecked misery,<br />announcing the dying of an age.''|The final stanza of the prophecy.}}
Meanwhile, in Myth Drannor, Larloch, the Netherese, and the Chosen of Mystra (allied with the elves) clashed in a catastrophic battle. As Tanthul began the draining ritual, his Netherese forces launched an attack on Myth Drannor, and Larloch attacked the baelnorns to drain the ancient magic in their possession. During the battle, Prince [[Vattick Tanthul]] was slain by [[Dove Falconhand]], who would then succumb to her own wounds, but not before having awakened the baelnorns of the tombs of Myth Drannor to defend their city and people. The [[Srinshee]] herself appeared to fight for Myth Drannor, ordering the baelnorns to protect the [[Tree of Souls]], and sacrificed herself to wrest magical power from both Tanthul and Larloch, then used the wards of Candlekeep and the mythal to strengthen the Weave.

As Elminster defeated Tanthul in a mage duel, the Netherese enclave crashed atop Myth Drannor. Elminster himself was saved by Mystra, who gained full control over the Weave once more, stopping Shar from turning it into a new Shadow Weave. The survivors of Myth Drannor, among them Coronal [[Ilsevele Miritar]] and her consort [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth|Fflar Starbrow]], were rescued by the Srinshee before she disappeared and transported to [[Semberholme]].{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/After the Fall}}

On the other hand, only a few [[Shadovar]] survived the fall of their city, among them the sisters [[Manarlume Tanthul|Manarlume]] and [[Lelavdra Tanthul]] and the [[arcanist]] [[Gwelt]]. They founded the 'Court of Three,' a society dedicated to saving the surviving Netherese of the Realms, hidden within one of the more intact towers in the [[Citadel of the Raven]].

As 1487 DR came to a close, the Second Sundering ended with the full return of Mystra and the Weave, the separation of the worlds Abeir and Toril.

==Aftermath==
After the Sundering, all the wars that started in its wake came to an end. In [[1488 DR]], the few remaining Netherese forces fought the Bedine over the [[Memory Spire]], causing an emergence of the [[phaerimm]]. The League of Silver Marches disbanded in the aftermath of the war with the orcs, and Sembia dissolved into city-states. By the end of the Sundering, the world began to look very much alike to how it was during the 14{{Th}} century [[DR]], although preserving a few of the changes from the tumultuous Era of Upheaval.

===Geographic changes===
At the end of the Second Sundering, most of the consequences that the Spellplague had wrought upon Toril were nowhere to be seen. The majority of the earthmotes had fallen, the Sea of Fallen Stars had returned to its pre-Spellplague volume, the Underchasm had been filled in, and nations and most of the lands that were sent to Abeir during the Spellplague had returned to Toril..

Halruaa, Lantan and Nimbral had returned to the Realms, and while Unther also returned, it did so in a more diminished form than before. However, some Abeiran lands and the new civilizations that arose in the century that followed the Spellplague still remained after the Sundering came to an end. Nations such as Tymanther and [[Akanûl]] remained in the Realms more or less in the way they were before the Sundering.

With the fall of Shade and the absence of the Netherese's sustaining magic, Anauroch's climate rapidly became arid once more and the lands at the heart of Faerûn rapidly deteriorated and once again became a desert. The waters receded from [[Luiren]], making the [[halfling]] homeland accessible again, although much of their territory was still underwater. Evermeet was restored to Toril, and by the end of the Second Sundering it touched Toril, the [[Feywild]] and [[Arvandor]] all at the same time.

===Changes to the Pantheon===
Many deities previously presumed dead or missing managed to return to life (or re-emerge) during the Second Sundering, then quickly amass new followers or win back their old faithful, and reclaim at least some of their former portfolios, resulting in a new distribution of spheres of influence among the Faerûnian deities. Known examples were [[Mystra]], [[Leira]], all the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi gods]], [[Azuth]], and [[Tyr]], among others.

For others deities, like [[Shar]], the Second Sundering resulted in a loss of power and influence. The Lady of Loss suffered greatly in the wake of the defeat of the Shadovar and the destruction of the city of Shade in the battle with the forces of Myth Drannor. Telamont Tanthul and most of the [[Princes of Shade]] were also killed, further weakening the goddess of darkness.

In [[1488 DR]], prayers to deities went unanswered, but their "Chosen" were still present. In [[1489 DR]], prayers to the gods began to be answered again, but the various deities withdrew their power and divine gifts from most of their "Chosen," their purpose fulfilled. 

In Flamerule of the same year  [[Eilistraee]] and [[Vhaeraun]] fully reacquired the power that they had possessed before [[1375 DR]]. They held their own old portfolios, and were separate entities. Eilistraee was still a drow goddess, as were most of their followers (not [[dark elves|dark elves,]]<nowiki/>despite a spell cast by [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] in [[1379 DR]]),{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum

The Second Sundering brought significant changes to how the deities approached mortals. Many gods became "quieter" than before, causing the emergence of new priesthoods in an attempt to explain the different divine behaviour in the post-Sundering world. The Mulhorandi gods still ruled among their people, directly interacting with them like the god-kings of old. The [[Dead Three]], greatly reduced in power, decided to remain on Toril, living as [[Quasi-deity|quasi-divine]] mortals, to spread the word of their return, gather more worshipers, and influence events in their favor. [[Bane]] led the trio in these efforts.<ref>

===Cosmology Changes===
After the Sundering, sages were unsure if there were changes to the cosmological order of the planes. Scholars came to the conclusion that the different cosmologies were just theoretical constructs created by mortals and not the true shape of the cosmos. By the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]], the most popular cosmological models among sages were the [[Great Wheel]], the [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis]], and the [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]] models.{{cite web|author=[[Jeremy Crawford]]|title=Jeremy's Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/558443947815489536|accessdate=2018-01-25}} The Great Wheel model remained the most commonly used of the three, but modified to include the planes discovered after the Spellplague, such as the [[Elemental Chaos]], the Feywild and the Shadowfell.
