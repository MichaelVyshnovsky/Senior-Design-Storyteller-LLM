        "mainbody": "The Night of Another Year was a holy night observed by worshipers of Jergal, the Lord of the End of Everything.\nOn the last night of the year, Nightal 30, Jergals Scriveners of Doom took a break from the endless recording of deaths by reading the names of every death they personally recorded over the past year. The ceremony culminated with the priests yelling \"One Year Closer\" and burning the scroll from which they were reading, signifying that work had begun for the next year."
