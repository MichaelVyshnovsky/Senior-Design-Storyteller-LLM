'''Dragondown''' was a holiday celebrated in [[Waterdeep]] on [[Kythorn 20]]. It commemorated the defeat of the several [[dragon]]s that threatened the city throughout its history.

==Description==
The holiday reenacted and celebrated the occasions in which dragons that attacked the city were either defeated or driven off. Parades reenacted each individual event, and bonfires and rituals to symbolically tame or bring down dragons were common across the city.

==Location==
Each parade had as its destination a square near the location where the respective dragon it represented was defeated.

==Activities==
Each parade sported a large effigy representing one particular dragon faced by the city. Once a parade reached its destination, the effigy was burned.

The main parade of the holiday reenacted the two times [[Kistarianth|Kistarianth the Red]] was driven from the city. It included two effigies, representing the dragon before and after its transformation into a [[dracolich]], and reached its destination on the slopes of [[Mount Waterdeep]]. The winners of two of the racing competitions held in the [[Plowing and Running]] holiday traditionally participated in this reenactment. The [[chariot]] champion played the role of [[Athar]], who defeated the dragon the first time, while the [[horse]] champion played the role of [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]], who defeated the dracolich decades later.
