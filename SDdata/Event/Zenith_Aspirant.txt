The '''Zenith Aspirant''' was a ritual observed by worshipers of [[Horus-Re]], the Lord of the Sun within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
This ritual occurred every day at midday. [[Priest]]s of Horus-Re gave descriptive sermons about their [[god]], often attempting to outdo rival factions by drawing larger crowds. The Zenith Aspirant was one of three daily rituals performed by [[priest]]s of Horus-Re and was considered to be the most important.
