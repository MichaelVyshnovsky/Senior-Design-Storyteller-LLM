Nightfall was the most important ritual of the Church of Shar.
Nightfall celebrated the coming of darkness. The ritual usually consisted of invocations and occasionally Shar communicated with her followers either through one of her clergy or lay worshiper, who had to be a woman with black hair. Dancing, eating and drinking were also part of the ritual.
Nightfall was held every night. The faithful of Shar were required to perform this ritual once per tenday, althought a worshiper was permitted to dance to Shar in private. Additionaly, the clergy of Shar were required to commit an act of wickedness every tenday in Her name.
Coming of the Lady was the name given to Nightfall when it coincided with moonless nights. This special ritual required the congregation of Shar to commit an act of significant act of retribution or depravity in Shars name.
