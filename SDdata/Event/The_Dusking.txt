The Dusking was an important religious event celebrated by followers of Myrkul, the Lord of Bones.
The Dusking ritual served as a reminder of all creatures mortality and how death was never far away. This ritual was performed daily at dusk. During the ritual ashes from cremated human remains, bones, and grave dust were mixed together within a glowing skull that floated over a black altar decorated with bones. Offerings were also made at this time by those who wished to appease Myrkul. The beginning and end of the ritual, as well as when an offering was made, were marked by a deep resonating bell.
