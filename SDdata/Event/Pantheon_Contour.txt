The anniversary of the signing of the '''Pantheon Contour''', an agreement between powers judged by [[Amaunator]], was the holiest day of the year for the Sun Lord's faithful.

The celebration occurred on the third full moon of the year. The clergy of Amaunator honored him by donning magesterial regalia and parading his [[holy symbol]] before every court they passed through the streets.
