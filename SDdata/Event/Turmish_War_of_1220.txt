The '''Turmish War of 1220''' was the armed conflict of [[1220 DR]] between the [[human]] nation of [[Turmish]] and [[dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom of [[Ironfang Deep]] of the [[Mountains of the Alaoreum]]. 

==Description==
In the {{YearlinkName|1220}}, Turmish military attacked the secluded dwarven Kingdom of Ironfang. The leader of Turmish at the time—warlord [[Sjorn Sendreth]]—sought to take the dwarven treasury and weapon stockpile by force. Humans spread death across the Alaoreum for the next twenty years as the dwarves of Ironfang defended against greedy invaders. The conflict was ended in the {{YearlinkName|1241}} as the Ironfang Deep dwarves collapsed a mountain on top of the surface part of their underground city in an attempt to secure themselves from Sjorn Sendreth's aggression.

For the next 50 years, dwarves of Ironfang were safe from Turmish. However, shortly after the War of 1220, the Kingdom of Ironfang was consumed by another war—the [[Campaign of Darkness]] against invading [[duergar]].
