The '''Night of Redemption''' was the explosive conclusion of the [[Reign of the Wyrm]] and a revolutionary conflict in the summer of [[1247 DR]].

==Description==
The Reign of the Wyrm was the period of time between [[1242 DR]] and 1247 DR, when the [[blue dragon]] [[Anaglathos]] ruled over the nation of [[Turmish]] after slaying Lord [[Sjorn Sendreth]]. The blue wyrm's rule was filled with terror and financial ruination of the nation, resulting in a rebellion led by [[paladin]] [[Corwin Freas]].

==Outcome==
As the Night of Redemption came to an end, Anaglathos was slain by Corwin Freas, and the surviving citizens of Alaghôn proclaimed the paladin the new Lord of Turmish. His reluctant rule saw the nation put back on its feet, and by the following year—[[1248 DR]], Corwin resigned, creating the [[Assembly of Stars]] and transforming Turmish into a democratic republic.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1242}}, Turmisian folk suffers enough under the tyrannical rule of the blue dragon. A rebellion sprouted to life. But soon, a handful of its members were captured and executed by being publicly burned at the stake. This act of cruelty was the spark that ignited the Night of Redemption. On a hot summer night, Paladin Corwin Freas led a group of adventurers in a head-on assault on the palace of the wyrm. The adventurers were successful, ending the life and the reign of tyrant Anaglathos.
