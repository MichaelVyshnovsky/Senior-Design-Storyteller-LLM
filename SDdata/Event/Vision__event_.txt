The '''Vision''' was a holy day observed by followers of the [[Savras]], the He of the Third Eye.

==Description==
The Vision occurred during the [[Feast of the Moon]] on the day between [[Uktar]] and [[Nightal]]. Every devout follower of Savras celebrated by strict meditation for the entire day. The form of meditation varied depending on the location. In some temples meditation was done in a sauna or steam room, while others meditated with hazy incense. All who participated were rewarded with a [[vision]] from Savras himself.
