        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of Hawa''' was a naval conflict that occurred between the [[mamluk]] fleet from [[Qudra]] and the [[Corsair (kit)|corsair]]s of [[Hawa]] in {{Yearlink|1357}}.{{AQ-time}}",
        "Location": "The battle took place on the waters of the [[Great Sea]] within the [[Corsair Domains]] of [[northwest Zakhara]].",
        "Events": "Qudra attempted to conquer Hawa, the center of power for the corsairs, once and for all. They sailed on the corsair capital without sufficient magical support with the hopes of taking the enemy by surprise. Qudra was repelled with great losses. The mamluk's would have been utterly crushed were it not for the efforts of [[Qazim al-Satir]] who managed to save many of the mamluk's ships with his magic.",
        "Outcome": "In addition to the physical loss of men and ships, Qudra suffered a debilitating hit on their overall morale. Qudra's display of weakness was noted by others as well and encouraged the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Utaqa]] to rebel."
