'''Gods' Day''' was an annual holiday in [[Waterdeep]] that commemorated the anniversary of the end of the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. It was held on [[Marpenoth 15]].

==Description==
The holiday was considered a solemn and serious event, especially at night, when Waterdhavians offered prayers in the city's temples to thank the [[god]]s for their lives and in remembrance of the catastrophic events of the Time of Troubles.

The holiday was particularly special to followers of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]. A huge festival was held at the [[House of Wonder]], specifically celebrating Midnight's elevation as the new Mystra. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this practice had gradually begun to be adopted in other temples dedicated to Mystra throughout [[Faer√ªn]].

==Activities==
During the day, a common custom involved people wearing their favored deities' [[holy symbol]]s and exposing their private shrines, as well as businesses displaying them in the windows. Customers who worshiped matching deities with their merchants enjoyed discounted prices on products and services, and the difference was donated to temples or to the city itself.

During the night festivities, the [[Griffon Cavalry]] set up a large bonfire at the top of [[Mount Waterdeep]] to honor the deities who appeared in the city during the conflict, namely, [[Ao]], [[Cyric]], [[Helm]], [[Kelemvor]], [[Myrkul]], and Mystra.

It was customary for people to decorate the inner walls of Waterdeep with [[garland]]s as part of the celebrations. The holiday was also semi-officially called '''Be Kind to the Guard and Watch Day''' as a form of gratitude for the efforts of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] to defend the city during Myrkul's invasion of the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle]], [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock]], and [[Southern Ward of Waterdeep|Southern]] Wards. Waterdhavians typically offered kind words to guardsmen and watchmen, as well as gifts. It was considered improper, however, to give any donation worth more than a few [[nib]]s, as it might be interpreted as bribery.

During the entire day, in memory of the [[wild magic]] that accompanied the Time of Troubles, the use of [[magic]] of any sort within the confines of the city was limited to self-defense and cases of extreme need only. Individual cases were adjudicated by the [[Lord's Court]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]] saw a considerable increase in visitation by people who had lost loved ones during the conflict.
