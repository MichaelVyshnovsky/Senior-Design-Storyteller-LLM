A worldfall was an occurrence where the planar energies of the multiverse aligned in such a way that large areas of land―or even entire cities―could transfer from one plane of existence to another.
Whenever a worldfall occurred, anyone within the affected area were transported along with the surrounding terrain.
Cities built by the eladrin often utilized worldfalls to travel to and from the Feywild.
* Shinaelestra, the eladrin city that shifted away to the Howling Forest on some unknown world at midnight every day, and returned to the Feywild at dawn.
