        "mainbody": "he Rout of the Pirate King was the event that took place in the city of Westgate on the Dragon Coast in 1182 DR.\nIn its past, the city of Westgate was known for its lenient attitude towards visitors, be they, adventurers or buccaneers. In the , these lax policies were taken advantage of by the infamous Pirate King Immurk and his gang of buccaneers. The  Pirate King hatched a daring ploy to assemble a large contingent of his men in Westgate and attempt to steal the entirety of the citys naval fleet. Immurks pirates were successful in taking over several vessels, but they promptly were sunk by a barrage of fireballs and smokepowder kegs fired at them by the remaining navy.\nThe event was commemorated in the form of a miniature diorama displayed in the Harbormasters Office of Westgate, along with other naval museum memorabilia."
