        "mainbody": "Waukeentide was a holiday observed in Waterdeep in honor of the goddess Waukeen. It consisted of a number of festivals bundled together into a single event.\nThe holiday was held in the form of a series of celebrations that also codified common business practices of Waterdeep, such as a review of the policies of the Guilds of Waterdeep, as well as renewal of guild membership. Businesses also typically stayed open until late and offered promotions to customers during this period.\nSome of the celebrations held during Waukeentide included\n* Tarsakh 1 Caravance, a commemoration of the first trade caravans to reach Waterdeep\n* Tarsakh 5 Goldenight, a night festival celebrating money and gold\n* Tarsakh 7 Guildsmeet, a gala festival in which guilds announced their new policies\n* Tarsakh 10 Leiruin, celebrating Waukeens punishment of an attempt at deception by Leira.\nThe original festival used to be one day long and focused on celebrating Waterdeeps free trade and commerce. It was gradually expanded to include older festivities, to a point where its name was only maintained by force of habit. In the 14 century DR, the tenday-long festival was already several centuries old."
