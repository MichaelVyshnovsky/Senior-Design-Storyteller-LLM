        "mainbody": "The Balefire was an important religious event celebrated by followers of Moander, the Rotting God.\nThe Balefire was the only calendar-related holy day observed by the Minions of Moander. Observed on Hammer 1, the Balefire celebrated Moanders minions ability to keep the cold at bay through the use of large bonfires. Moander would often manifest within each bonfire to thank his followers and give an inspirational sermon. Moander would then task his followers with important missions to see them through the cold months ahead while he retreated to the Underdark during the winter months."
