        "mainbody": "The Umara Rebellion occurred in the Free City of Umara.\nKhan Ubar khel Muhif of the Astok tribe offered his service to the Caliph of Umara once he attained enlightenment. Ubar decided to seize an opportunity when the Caliphs forces were busy battling the forces of Muluk in a separate engagement. Ubar staged a coup within the palace and deposed the former Caliph. He married the Caliphs daughter, Princess Maran to solidify his claim. Forces from Qudra were sent to Umara in response to the rebellion, but order had been restored before they arrived. Qudra accepted Ubars claim as Caliph in order to prevent an extended siege of Umara.\nUbar became Caliph of Umara, bringing with him many barbarians of the Astok tribe. Tension between native Umarans and the newly introduced barbarians was extremely high, brewing for a potential clash."
