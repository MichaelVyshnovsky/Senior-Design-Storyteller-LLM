        "History": "''Circa'' 1269 DR, [[Damien Morienus]], a former master of the North Tower of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]] relocated to Icewind Dale together with his wife [[Mathilda]]. He was a powerful [[necromancer]] who was using the local barbarian tribes for his horrific experiments.\n\nEventually, Damien's wife left him for a young barbarian named [[Kinnuki]]. The necromancer's pride demanded revenge and he summoned demons to search for the barbarian. The enslaved demons spent a few years in a fruitless chase, but Kinnuki's knowledge of the snow lands was just too great.\n\nThe monsters decided to even the odds and used their infernal magics to summon [[hellfire]] to melt all the snow away. But they melted too much snow, thus flooding the tundra and melting the permafrost, causing the disaster later known as The Great Thaw by the locals. Most never learned about the true nature of it, believing it to be a natural event. The Thaw took the lives of Kinnuki's tribe and family, leaving only the barbarian and his daughter [[Jukini]] alive.\n\nThe permafrost on the banks of [[Maer Dualdon]], where the necromancer's tower was located was affected as well as the rest of the region. The Accursed Tower slowly sank into the mud, killing its inhabitants. Over time, the memories of its very existence were gone from the minds of the locals."
