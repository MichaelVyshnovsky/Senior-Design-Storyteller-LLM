        "mainbody": "'''Founders' Day''' was an annual holiday celebrating the founding of the city of [[Waterdeep]]. It was held on [[Flamerule 1]].",
        "Activities": "Several locations in the city commemorated the holiday. In the [[Field of Triumph]], the history of the city was retold through [[illusion|illusory]] displays. The stadium was also the site of martial exhibitions by the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]].\n\nIt was also common for festhalls throughout the city to hold costume contests. Participants dressed up as historical figures such as [[Raurlor]] and [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben the Elder]] and the best impersonators were awarded prizes.\n\nA particularly spectacular practice was the veiling of [[Castle Waterdeep]] with an illusion that made it appear like the ancient fortress of [[Nimoar]]. The illusion required the combined efforts of several [[wizard]]s and was typically in place between midday and sunset. It was considered an extraordinary display of magical art.",
        "History": "In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], the practice of covering multiple locations of the city in illusions was deemed distracting and frivolous and was abolished for several decades. However, by the late 15{{th}} century DR, at least the custom of masking Castle Waterdeep had been reinstated.\n\nOn Founders' Day in the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} [[Ammalia Cassalanter]] planned to [[poison]] multiple people during a feast in order to offer their souls as sacrifice to [[Asmodeus]] in an attempt to save the souls of her younger children, while at the same time her husband [[Victoro Cassalanter]] planned to steal the hoard of [[Dragon (coin)|dragon coins]] from the [[Vault of Dragons]] as the monetary counterpart of the deal."
