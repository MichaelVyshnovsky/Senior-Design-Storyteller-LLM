        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of the Burning''' was a short but bloody conflict that raged in [[Wealdath]] of [[Tethyr]] ''circa'' [[1350 DR]].",
        "History": "The Battle of the Burning occurred as a retaliatory act after a retired band of adventurers dim-wittingly attempted to expand a valley near to Wealdath's [[the Shield|Shield]], where they settled. They tried to torch the woods â€“ the act that enraged the elfin inhabitants of the Unspoiled Woods. All of the adventurers were slain along with every single farmer, beast of burden, and cattle, who resided in the valley. When the raging fires died down, the scorched bodies were discovered, all pinned with [[arrow]]s. The trees remained smoldering for several months after the Battle of the Burning, and black clouds of trees make hung over the forest as a dire warning.\n\nAs of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[human]] arrow-pierced skeletons were being left along elven trails through the Shield, magically attached to the tops of dead burned trees. These signs were hard to miss as they were lit aglow with magical blue-green radiance."
