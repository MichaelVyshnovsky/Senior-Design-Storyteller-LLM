The Feast of Lanterns was an annual week-long festival held in Shou Lung and Kozakura and celebrated in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North as of the late 15 century DR. It took place in the month of Tsou of the Kara-Turan calendar during the first new moon of the calendar year.

In the late 15 century DR, the festival was brought to Neverwinter by Lord Neverember’s effort to partner with nations across the Far Realms. The festival was shared with the citys many inhabitants, adventurers, visitors, and Kara-Turan expatriates, organized by Taishi Fei, an envoy. Taishi tasked adventurers of the Protectors Enclave with giving out red gift envelopes to fledgling adventurers, offering the reward of lunar coins and commemorative gold leaf-covered wooden year of the ox coins (or coins symbolizing the appropriate animal), crafted to resemble eastern gold billions. Far Eastern pyrobolists organized firework displays, mounting the rockets onto mortars, sometimes with the help of adventurers. Some of the exotic goods brought to the Sword Coast were miniature ox stots and New Years oxen, fireworks, and fanciful ceremonial Shou greatswords. During the Year of the Dragon, the envoys brought trained hatchlings of jade dragonnels and New Years dragonnels with different color scales, as well as a new sweet treat – mooncakes. Other years also supplied miniature trained animal mascots of each of the years.
