The New Moon Beneficence was a charitable feast in Yhaunn held monthly by the temple of Sel√ªne, Moonshadow Hall.
The New Moon Beneficence was a public feast for the citys poor held at Moonshadow Hall, open to all faiths. The event was instituted by High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar in order to bring positivity and joy to the night of the new moon through feasting and song.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, Moonmistress-Designate Feena Archwood met with representatives of the citys administration, guilds, merchants, and other temples to raise support for a larger version of the feast which would support more people. Although the idea met with general approval, during the next new moon the feast held at Moonshadow Hall was interrupted by an attack by Sharrans and shadow mastiffs led by Variance Amatick.
