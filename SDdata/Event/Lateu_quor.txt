'''Lateu'quor''', the Forest Communion of the Crescent Moon, was a religious ceremony in which the [[Seldarine|elven deity]] [[Corellon]] was praised by his followers and his gift of creativity honored. It was held once per lunar month, when the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]] was in its quarter phase, a crescent, and softly illuminating the night sky.

==Description==
Followers of Corellon gathered in moonlit glades, where they praised their Creator through music, song, and dance and offerings of beautiful artwork. The art was not destroyed; sometimes it was physically transferred to [[Arvandor]] for [[elves]] to enjoy in the [[afterlife]], while other times it was used to decorate Corellon's temples and shrines for elves to enjoy in life.

On rare and special occasions, Corellon himself would play a role, and the very landscape of the glade was reshaped into a work of art, becoming sacred to the god. Other times, his magic would form an item of unearthly beauty, such as a [[sword]], [[longbow]], [[cloak]] and [[boots]], a suit of ''[[elven chain|elven mail]]'' [[armor]], or a [[:Category:Instruments|musical instrument]]. These treasures were then enchanted by senior [[priest]]s of the faith, and were considered holy relics.
