        "mainbody": "he Ceremony of Introspection was a religious ritual observed by worshipers of Thoth, the Lord of Magic within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThoths clergy did not waste time with fancy ceremonies and holidays like the clergy of other faiths, instead they observed the Ceremony of Introspection where they fasted for an entire day on the winter and summer solstice. They would immerse themselves in an icy bath at the end of the fast. The ceremony symbolized their desire for knowledge and reemergence into the world with a renewed hunger to pursue it."
