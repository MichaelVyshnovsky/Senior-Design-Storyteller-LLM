        "mainbody": "'''Fey Day''' was a holiday held in [[Waterdeep]] and the surrounding countryside during the vernal equinox on [[Ches 19]]. It celebrated the weakening of the barriers between the [[Prime Material plane]] and the [[faerie]] realm of the [[Feywild]].",
        "Description": "Due to the increased proximity between the Feywild and the Prime Material Plane, the influence each realm had over the other was considered to be at its height. While rural areas regarded the date with trepidation and practiced many superstitions (avoiding the forests, leaving confectionery treats on their porches, and the like), in [[Waterdeep]] it was a day of celebration.",
        "Activities": "The nobles hosted lavish masquerades, while the lower classes attired themselves in homemade disguises and went around soliciting temporary access into the celebrations in exchange for entertaining the crowds. Costumes included those of fey beings and Feywild rulers, such as [[Titania]], [[Oberon]], and [[Hyrsam]]. The joyous festival tended to be seen with scorn by some inhabitants who considered the practice foolish and preferred to stay at home during the event."
