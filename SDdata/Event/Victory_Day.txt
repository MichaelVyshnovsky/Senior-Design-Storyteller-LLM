'''Victory Day''' was an important holiday in the history of [[Zhentil Keep]].

==History==
Following the [[Fall of Zhentil Keep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the city continued to be under siege for many months. Finally, on [[Kythorn 13]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the last of the [[humanoid]] forces were driven from the city by the [[Zhentilar]]. Full reconstruction of the city began in earnest after this event.
