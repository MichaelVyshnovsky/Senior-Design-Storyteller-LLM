'''Shadow binding''' was a religous ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Eshowdow]], the Shadow Giant within the [[Chultan pantheon]].

==Description==
These ceremonies were usually performed on the [[Day of All Sighs]]. During the ceremony, a recipient's shadow was bound to their physical body via extensive use of the ''[[summon shadow spirit]]'' [[spell]] cast by a member of the [[Eshewtak]].
