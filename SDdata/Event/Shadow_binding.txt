Shadow binding was a religous ceremony observed by worshipers of Eshowdow, the Shadow Giant within the Chultan pantheon.
These ceremonies were usually performed on the Day of All Sighs. During the ceremony, a recipients shadow was bound to their physical body via extensive use of the summon shadow spirit spell cast by a member of the Eshewtak.
