The '''Running of the Saurs''' was an event held in [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was not to be confused with&mdash;and was significantly more dangerous than&mdash;the city's famous [[dinosaur races]].

{{Quote|Clear the streets! The Running of the Saurs is upon us!}}

==Description==
In the annual Running of the Saurs, a wide variety of rider-less [[dinosaur]]s&mdash;including [[stegosaurus]]es, [[triceratops]]es, and [[dimetrodon]]s&mdash;were let loose to run through the city as locals and visitors evaded them. The stampeding river of dinosaurs smashed timbers, swept up [[:Category:Fruits|fruits]], flattened [[basket]]s, and generally made a mess of the streets. Cleaning up afterward was not a quick process. 

Local sailors and citizens partook in watching or running, and shops closed during the event. The chaos also made the event well-suited for [[thieves]] and burglars to ply their trades.

==Location==
While the event was chaotic, the dinosaurs ran from the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] through the [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]] and into the [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]]. Places like the [[Grand Souk]] were well-protected against the dinosaurs, and provided safe haven for people trying to escape them.

==History==

When the Running of the Saurs was held during the time of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} the event was marked both by a large amount of banditry&mdash;with some pirates even trying to shake down the [[Sibonseni|high priestess]] at the [[Hall of Gold]]&mdash;as well as the appearance of [[undead]] in the Old City, which caused the panicking and confused dinosaurs to reverse direction and flood back into Port Nyanzaru.
