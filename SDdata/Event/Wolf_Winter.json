        "mainbody": "he Wolf Winter, sometimes called Wolfs Winter, was an especially harsh and unseasonably early winter that struck Damara and the rest of the Bloodstone Lands in the .\nThe early frosts of the Wolf Winter destroyed Damaras harvest, thus causing starvation to run rampant during the already harsh northern winter. Compounding the issue, food became scarce for wild animals and beasts as well, This led to packs of hungry dire wolves and werewolves emerging from the Galena Mountains to attack the northern Damaran provinces, killing and devouring everything in their path.\nThe Wolf Winter affected much of the Bloodstone Lands, including Vaasa and the northern territories of Damara near the Galena Mountains, and reached far enough south to decimate the Damaran harvest,\nThe Wolf Winter was widely thought to have been brought about by Zhengyi the Witch-King as it coincided with his clandestine takeover of Bloodstone Mines that same year and immediately preceded his full-scale invasion of Damara the following spring. Among the people of the Bloodstone Lands, it was widely believed that there was precedent for powerful evil forces to create such extreme winters.\nThe loss of the harvest and subsequent wolf attacks hit the Barony of Bloodstone particularly hard, with at least seventy inhabitants of Bloodstone Village falling prey to the wolves. Even over a decade later, the psychological scars were still fresh for many of the residents, and many feared that another such winter could befall them again."
