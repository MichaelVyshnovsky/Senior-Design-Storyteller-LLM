Myrkulytes believed that on this day the [[spirit]]s of all the deceased rose to pass unseen throughout [[Faer√ªn]], searching for any living descendants to communicate short messages with them by writing in dust, [[sand]], or moving small objects. Myrkulytes celebrated this with prayer, song, and chants. This continued until midnight and another ritual called the [[Flagons of the Fallen]]."
