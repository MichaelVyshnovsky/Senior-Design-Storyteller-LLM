The '''Balefire''' was an important religious event celebrated by followers of [[Moander]], the Rotting God.

==History==
The Balefire was the only calendar-related holy day observed by the Minions of Moander. Observed on [[Hammer 1]], the Balefire celebrated Moander's minions' ability to keep the cold at bay through the use of large bonfires. Moander would often manifest within each bonfire to thank his followers and give an inspirational sermon. Moander would then task his followers with important missions to see them through the cold months ahead while he retreated to the [[Underdark]] during the winter months.
