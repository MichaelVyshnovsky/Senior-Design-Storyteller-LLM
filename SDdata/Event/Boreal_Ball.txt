The '''Boreal Ball''' was an unending party hosted by the aptly named [[Baron of the Boreal Ball]].

==Description==
The Ball was a chance for revelry and intrigue in equal measure. Guests could dance, watch the dancing, or mingle with the various [[fey]] and other attendees. Guests jockeyed to make positive impressions on each other, or to discredit their rivals, hoping to earn the Baron's favor.

Guests for the Ball received [[magic]]al invitations from the Baron, which let them know the appointed time at which they were to attend. At that time, they were then [[teleport]]ed to the party where they danced, schemed, or did whatever else they wished for three dances before the Baron arrived to greet them.

==Location==
The ball was held at a palace of ice located within the [[Feywild]].

==History==
Notable attendees of the Ball included the [[satyr]] [[Cannifer]], the [[drow]] [[Raxas Albrethin]], the [[dryad]] [[Darisis]], the [[pixie]] [[Fidget]], the [[green hag]] [[Granny Snailtongue]], and the [[hobgoblin]] [[Varka]].

At some point, [[Minsc]] (and [[Boo]]) and [[Delina]] attended the Ball.
