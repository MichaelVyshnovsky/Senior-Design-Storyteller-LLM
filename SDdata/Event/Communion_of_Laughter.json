        "mainbody": "day of each month\nThe Communion of Laughter was a worship service held by the church of Garl Glittergold on the 13 day of each month, a date considered auspicious in gnome folklore. It was a day-long celebration in which gnomes revered Garl Glittergold through a series of joyous activities.\nTypically, the gnomes engaged in a period of quiet prayer and contemplation, danced on the temples central dais, enjoyed a communal meal in which they shared food, told stories alongside displays of magic, and competed to tell jokes. This last event usually went until late in the night. Otherwise, the specific order of events varied with each temple.\nEach attendee was encouraged to donate a piece of gold or a handful of gold dust, or other precious metal, as a tribute to Garl. The temple uses these donations to benefit the community as a whole."
