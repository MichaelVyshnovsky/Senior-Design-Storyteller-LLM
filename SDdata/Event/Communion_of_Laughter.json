        "mainbody": "The '''Communion of Laughter''' was a worship service held by the [[church of Garl Glittergold]] on the 13{{th}} day of each month, a date considered auspicious in gnome folklore. It was a day-long celebration in which [[gnome]]s revered [[Garl Glittergold]] through a series of joyous activities.",
        "Activities": "Typically, the gnomes engaged in a period of quiet prayer and contemplation, danced on the temple's central dais, enjoyed a communal meal in which they shared food, told stories alongside displays of [[magic]], and competed to tell jokes. This last event usually went until late in the night. Otherwise, the specific order of events varied with each temple.\n\nEach attendee was encouraged to donate a piece of [[gold]] or a handful of gold dust, or other precious metal, as a tribute to Garl. The temple uses these donations to benefit the community as a whole."
