The '''Rite of Respect''' was a religious ritual observed by the clergy of [[Tiamat]], the Dragon Queen within the [[Untheric pantheon]].

==Description==
This complicated ritual of abasement was performed any time a [[priest]] of Tiamat approached one of the Dragon Queen's spawns. The Rite of Respect did not protect the priest from the spawn's wrath, but failure to perform the ritual ensured their death at the hands, or fangs, of the spawn.
