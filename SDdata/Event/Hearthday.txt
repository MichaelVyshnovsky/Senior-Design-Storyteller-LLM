Hearthday was a monthly holiday observed by the worshipers of the halfling deity Cyrrollalee on the first day of every month.
The hin communities celebrated Hearthday by opening their homes to neighbors to strengthen bonds and foster trust. The host household rotated, opening a new home to the community every month. As friendship among the members of Cyrrollaleen communities was the highest form of worship, the holiday had no requirements â€“ the only acts of worship requested by the Hand of Fellowship were simple prayers asking for the goddess blessing.
