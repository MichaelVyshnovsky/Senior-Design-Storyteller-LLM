        "Description": "The festival celebrated honest merchants. As part of the day's activities, members of the several [[guilds of Waterdeep]] renewed their memberships and paid their annual dues. Additionally, the guildmasters met the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to keep them apprised of their charters for the coming year.\n\nDuring the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], criminals charged with commercial crimes such as robbery and theft were subjected to public ridicule by being brought in front of the [[Palace of Waterdeep]], where guild members threw [[nib]]s at them. The [[copper]] collected in this way was donated to the city.",
        "History": "The festival was instituted to celebrate when the [[goddess]] [[Waukeen]] caught [[Leira]] trying to cheat her in an honest deal. As punishment, Waukeen buried Leira under a mountain of molten [[gold]].\n\nOriginally a separate holiday, Leiruin was incorporated into Waukeentide and became one of the [[tenday]]-long holiday's many festivities."
