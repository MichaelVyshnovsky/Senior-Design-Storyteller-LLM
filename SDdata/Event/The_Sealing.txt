The '''Sealing''' was a ritual performed by worshipers of [[Jergal]], the Lord of the End of Everything.<ref name="PaP-p33" >

==Description==
[[Scriveners of Doom]] were required to perform the ritual each time they recorded a death, method of death, and destination in the afterlife. The ritual involved sprinkling a mixture of powdered bone and ash over the recently inscribed words to blot the ink. The ritual also signified an additional step toward the end of the world.
