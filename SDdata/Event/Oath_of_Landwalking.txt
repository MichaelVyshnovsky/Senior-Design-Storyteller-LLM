The '''Oath of Landwalking''' was a solemn oath taken by worshipers of [[Grumbar]], the King of the Land Below the Roots.

==Description==
All members of the [[Church of Grumbar]] took the Oath of Landwalking upon becoming [[priest]]s of Grumbar, promising to never travel by either air or sea. Travel over water was allowed only when the Church would benefit. Breaking the Oath of Landwalking would result in the loss of the priest's spellcasting abilities.
