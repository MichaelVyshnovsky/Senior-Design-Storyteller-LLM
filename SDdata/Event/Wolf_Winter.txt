The '''Wolf Winter''', sometimes called '''Wolf's Winter''', was an especially harsh and unseasonably early winter that struck [[Damara]] and the rest of the [[Bloodstone Lands]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}.

==Description==
The early frosts of the Wolf Winter destroyed Damara's harvest, thus causing starvation to run rampant during the already harsh northern winter. Compounding the issue, food became scarce for wild animals and beasts as well, This led to packs of hungry [[dire wolves]] and [[werewolves]] emerging from the [[Galena Mountains]] to attack the northern Damaran provinces, killing and devouring everything in their path.

==Location==
The Wolf Winter affected much of the [[Bloodstone Lands]], including [[Vaasa]] and the northern territories of Damara near the Galena Mountains, and reached far enough south to decimate the Damaran harvest,

==History==
The Wolf Winter was widely thought to have been brought about by [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] as it coincided with his clandestine takeover of [[Bloodstone Mines]] that same year and immediately preceded his full-scale [[Vaasan War|invasion of Damara]] the following spring. Among the people of the Bloodstone Lands, it was widely believed that there was precedent for powerful [[evil]] forces to create such extreme winters.<ref>

The loss of the harvest and subsequent [[wolf]] attacks hit the Barony of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] particularly hard, with at least seventy inhabitants of [[Bloodstone Village]] falling prey to the wolves. Even over a decade later, the psychological scars were still fresh for many of the residents, and many feared that another such winter could befall them again.
