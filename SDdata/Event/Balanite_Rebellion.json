        "mainbody": "he Balanite Rebellion was a series of uprisings instigated by followers of Bala, the Zakharan goddess of music, within the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara.\nMahabba was the center of the Balanites power and the primary focus of their attacks.\nThe most recent uprising occurred in 1360 DR when Caliph Mogan bin Ahmed of Mahabba was assassinated by suspected holy slayers of the Final Chord.  \nThe League of the Pantheon formed early during the reign of the first Grand Caliph of Zakhara. The five gods worshiped in these Pantheist cities at that time became the Gods of the Pantheon and were the only gods considered to be enlightened. Mahabba joined the Pantheist League after the League had already been established, bringing with them their worship of \"unenlightened\" Bala, the Zakharan goddess of music. The other cities of the Pantheist League protested this sacrilege violently, sending their armies to crush the forces of Mahabba and the Balanite heresy festering within that city.\nThis event caused the Grand Caliph to consult the Law of the Loregiver to determine what constituted an enlightened god. He eventually established the traditional eight enlightened gods, but for Bala and Mahabba the damage had already been done. Driven underground, the Balanites in Mahabba rose in rebellion several times over the next five hundred years with the hopes of ultimately ousting the Pantheist version of enlightenment from their city and the entire region."
