        "mainbody": "he Festival of Vengeance was a holy day observed by the clergy of Tiamat, the Dragon Queen within the Untheric pantheon.\nThe Dark Scaly Ones in Unther declared the first full moon after Midsummer to be the Festival of Vengeance, celebrating Tiamats victory over Gilgeam. Pure anarchy incited by Tiamats followers usually broke out in Unthalass on this day. Members of the Serpent Guards, a group of crusaders devoted to the Dragon Queen, used this day for planned assassinations as well."
