The Chant of the Fastness was a consecration event observed by worshipers of Eldath, the Goddess of Singing Waters.
The Chant of the Fastness occurred when a new open-aired temple or shrine was consecrated for Eldath. Large numbers of clergy gathered at these locations to witness the appearance of an avatar of their goddess who blessed their efforts. The avatar would bless the flowing water at the location, temporarily transforming it into the water of Eldath, a magical water that would heal and regenerate any creature immersed for the next ten days.
