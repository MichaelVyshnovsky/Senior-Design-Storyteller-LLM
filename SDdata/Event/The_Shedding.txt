The '''Shedding''' was a religious event observed by devout followers of [[Sseth]], the World Serpent.

==Activities==
The Shedding was the most sacred holy event for the [[Ssethsar]], or the followers of Sseth. This event occurred in [[Alturiak]] immediately following the month-long hibernation called the [[Sagacious Slumber]]. The Ssethsar would shed their snake skin, or ritually remove their clerical garb if they were not reptilian, during a ritual involving the sacrifice of at least one living sentient being. The sacrifice was usually followed by a burst of activity the Ssethsar used to extend their powers.
