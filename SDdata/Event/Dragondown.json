        "mainbody": "ragondown was a holiday celebrated in Waterdeep on Kythorn 20. It commemorated the defeat of the several dragons that threatened the city throughout its history.\nThe holiday reenacted and celebrated the occasions in which dragons that attacked the city were either defeated or driven off. Parades reenacted each individual event, and bonfires and rituals to symbolically tame or bring down dragons were common across the city.\nEach parade had as its destination a square near the location where the respective dragon it represented was defeated.\nEach parade sported a large effigy representing one particular dragon faced by the city. Once a parade reached its destination, the effigy was burned.\nThe main parade of the holiday reenacted the two times Kistarianth the Red was driven from the city. It included two effigies, representing the dragon before and after its transformation into a dracolich, and reached its destination on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep. The winners of two of the racing competitions held in the Plowing and Running holiday traditionally participated in this reenactment. The chariot champion played the role of Athar, who defeated the dragon the first time, while the horse champion played the role of Piergeiron, who defeated the dracolich decades later."
