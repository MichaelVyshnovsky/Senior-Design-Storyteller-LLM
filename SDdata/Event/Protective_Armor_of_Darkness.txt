The '''Protective Armor of Darkness''', which was also called '''elah'ranak''' in [[Alzhedo]], was a religious event observed by worshipers of [[Ibrandul]], the Lord of the Dry Depths.

==Description==
[[Priest]]s of Ibrandul participated in this secret ritual upon reaching a certain rank within the [[Church of Ibrandul]]. The priest would drink the blood of an [[ibrandlin]] while the high priest of one of Ibrandul's churches, called an [[Impenetrable Lurker]], performed a magical ceremony. The [[magic]] of the ritual caused much of the priest's arms, chest, back, and legs to become covered in hardened overlapping scales, offering a great deal of protection at the cost of making them a terrifying sight to behold.
