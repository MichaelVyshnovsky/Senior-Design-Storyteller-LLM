The '''Day of Wonders''' was a holiday celebrated in [[Waterdeep]] on [[Marpenoth 3]]. It featured a display and parade of inventions created by worshipers of [[Gond]].

==Description==
The parade showcased the most recent inventions constructed by the Gondar, many of which were revealed during that day. The inventions ranged from the simplest small devices to enormous autonomous [[construct]]s.

Due to the experimental nature of the inventions on display, it was very common for devices to fail and cause disruptions to the celebrations.

==History==
Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], one particularly noteworthy device failure during a parade involved a flying chair constructed by [[Marchell]]. The chair could ascend indefinitely, but was incapable of descending. Although the inventor was eventually rescued by the [[Griffon Cavalry]], the chair was never recovered.
