The Wonders of Gond was an impromptu holiday that occurred in Neverwinter whenever the church of Gond arrived in town to offer encouragement to artisans, engineers, and crafters.
The timing of the holiday was unpredictable, but was said to occur whenever Gond determined that the city needed some encouragement. His clerics would inspire and reward crafting of new objects and inventions. In particular, they encouraged the creation of toys, drinks, and intricate mechanical "doohickeys" designed to impress their god.
During the year in which the death curse occurred, the Wonders of Gond fell between Midsummer and Highharvestide.
