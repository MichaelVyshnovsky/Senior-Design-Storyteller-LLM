Calling Down the Thunder was the most sacred religious event for followers of Talos, the Destroyer.
The faithful of Talos enjoyed using lighting strikes to display their gods power on all occasions, but during this sacred ritual an intelligent sacrifice was struck dead by lightning in exchange for a favor from Talos. The favor was usually the brief ability to cast a spell beyond the participants normal skill, but sometimes a deadly storm was sent to target a specific area selected by the Talassan.
