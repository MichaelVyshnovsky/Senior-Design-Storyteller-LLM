'''Halaster's Higharvestide''' was an event that occurred in [[Undermountain]] on [[Higharvestide]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.

==History==
===Abduction===
At dawn on Higharvestide of 1369 DR, two members of the [[Twisted Rune]] managed to kidnap [[Halaster Blackcloak]] from inside Undermountain. The [[lich]] [[Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk]] and the [[alhoon]] [[Ralayan|Ralayan the Occultacle]] used a ''[[ring of multiple wishes]]'' to bind and summon the Mad Mage to [[Stardock]], where they intended to probe the great [[archmage]]'s mind for his intricate knowledge of [[portal]]s and magical [[gate]]s.

Before being captured, Halaster sent out a ''[[sending]]'' to all practitioners of [[Magic|the Art]] within 400 miles, a clue that could lead would-be rescuers to where he was held. It said "Seek me at Aquitiocun!" The sign of the Mad Mage appeared as a 75-foot-diameter (23 meters) floating sigil of black flames in the harbor, blocking all traffic until it dispersed at [[Hours of the day|highsun]].

===Mayhem===
Because Halaster was the eye of the storm that was Undermountain, his kidnapping allowed the madness of the dungeon to escape. Gates began randomly transporting creatures from Undermountain to places throughout the Realms, causing havoc and destruction everywhere. Among the many events, [[fire salamander]]s destroyed parts of [[Luskan]], a [[gorgimera]] and [[manticore]]s attacked [[Shadowdale]], a legion of [[gargoyle]]s laid siege to [[Suzail]], and a [[Shipwrack Juggernaut|juggernaut]] formed from shipwrecks flattened the pirates' port of [[Skaug (port)|Skaug]]. But by far the greatest amount of mayhem spilled out into the city of [[Waterdeep]] itself.

===Rescue===
A group of adventures hired by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] managed to reach Stardock and free Halaster. The Mad Mage immediately returned to Undermountain, which quelled the chaos of the dungeon and ended the terror of Halaster's Higharvestide within hours. The two mages of the Twisted Rune fled Undermountain by means of ''[[teleport]]'' spells before Halaster's rescuers could attack them.
