Unity of Fire was a religious ceremony undergone by all firewalkers, the specialty priests of Kossuth, that celebrated their ability to summon a fire elemental upon reaching a certain level of skill.
This ceremony was always preceded by a full day of the firewalker praying and chanting. Afterwards, they would summon a fire elemental and bestow upon them gifts in the form of food prepared by their own hands and a coffer made of some precious metal, often times copper, that was full of various coins, gemstones, and jewelry. These were said to be carried away by the fire elemental back to the Crimson Pillar, the divine realm of Kossuth.
