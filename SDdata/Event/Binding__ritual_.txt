The Binding was an unholy ritual performed by worshipers of Gargauth every eve of the Feast of the Moon.
Each priest of the Hidden Lord was required to renew their eternal contract with Gargauth, pledging their unending service for more power. The participant sacrificed possessions of theirs including wealth, hoarded knowledge, and magic. The personal sacrifices were succeeded by a casting of the spiritual corruption and mask of Gargauth spells.
