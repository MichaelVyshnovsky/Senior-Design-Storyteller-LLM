Seeing Justice was one of the several monthly high rituals of the Church of Tyr.
The ritual was performed on the first day of every month.
During the ceremony, the worshipers would chant prayers and loudly sing hymns, which summoned the illusion of a gigantic searing-white war hammer hovering over their heads, radiating heat.
