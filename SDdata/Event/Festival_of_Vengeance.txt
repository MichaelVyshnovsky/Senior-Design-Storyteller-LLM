The '''Festival of Vengeance''' was a holy day observed by the clergy of [[Tiamat]], the Dragon Queen within the [[Untheric pantheon]].

==Description==
The [[Dark Scaly Ones]] in [[Unther]] declared the first full moon after [[Midsummer]] to be the Festival of Vengeance, celebrating Tiamat's victory over [[Gilgeam]]. Pure anarchy incited by Tiamat's followers usually broke out in [[Unthalass]] on this day. Members of the [[Serpent Guards]], a group of [[crusader]]s devoted to the Dragon Queen, used this day for planned assassinations as well.
