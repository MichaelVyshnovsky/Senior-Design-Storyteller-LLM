Regardless of their current location, [[priest]]s of Shaundakul were required to face a strong wind and cast ''[[wind walk]]'' and ''[[wraithform]]'' at dawn on this day. The [[magic]] of the [[spell]]s was enchanced to last from dawn until dusk. The priest would spend the day soaring high with the wind to honor their [[god]]."
