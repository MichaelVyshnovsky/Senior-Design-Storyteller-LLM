        "Description": "The Foreshadowing occurred only on nights when the clouds covered the new moon, cloaking the land in utter darkness. Ibrandulin's [[priest]]s would emerge from the depths at midnight, enacting the ritual that celebrated their [[god]]'s promise to one day cover all of the land in darkness."
