        "mainbody": "he Shedding was a religious event observed by devout followers of Sseth, the World Serpent.\nThe Shedding was the most sacred holy event for the Ssethsar, or the followers of Sseth. This event occurred in Alturiak immediately following the month-long hibernation called the Sagacious Slumber. The Ssethsar would shed their snake skin, or ritually remove their clerical garb if they were not reptilian, during a ritual involving the sacrifice of at least one living sentient being. The sacrifice was usually followed by a burst of activity the Ssethsar used to extend their powers."
