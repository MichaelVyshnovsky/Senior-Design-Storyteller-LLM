The Dawn Cataclysm was an attempt by the god Lathander to reshape the pantheon of deities more in his own image. It is unknown when this event occurred but Lathander failed, resulting in the destruction of several deities and "powerful outsiders".
The precise chronology of the Dawn Cataclysm in mortal terms is murky, and no historian of the Realms was able to date it definitively. Did it happen before or after the first of the Magisters was ordained by Mystra? Was the Dawn Cataclysm, as some claim, an event that climaxed in the , when the last of Tyches chosen died in the coils of Moander? Was it the culmination, in part, of the battle between Savras and Azuth? No mortal could say for sure.
