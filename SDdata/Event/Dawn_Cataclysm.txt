The '''Dawn Cataclysm''' was an attempt by the god [[Lathander]] to reshape the pantheon of [[deity|deities]] more in his own image. It is unknown when this event occurred but Lathander failed, resulting in the destruction of several deities and "powerful outsiders".

==A Historical Puzzle==
The precise chronology of the Dawn Cataclysm in mortal terms is murky, and no historian of the Realms was able to date it definitively. Did it happen before or after the first of the [[Magister]]s was ordained by [[Mystra]]? Was the Dawn Cataclysm, as some claim, an event that climaxed in the {{YearlinkName|161}}, when the last of [[Tyche]]'s chosen died in the coils of [[Moander]]? Was it the culmination, in part, of the battle between [[Savras]] and [[Azuth]]? No mortal could say for sure.
