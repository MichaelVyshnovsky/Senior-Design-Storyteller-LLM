'''Wheelmoot''' was a [[:category:festivals|festival]] held annually in the city of [[Crimmor]].

==Description==
Once a year, when winter sets in and caravans stopped running because of the ice and snow, the mayor of Crimmor declared open the festival of Wheelmoot. Because it was linked to weather conditions, the exact dates of the festival changed from one year to the next. During Wheelmoot, every [[:category:shops|shops]] closed except for the ones selling [[:category:food and drink|food and drinks]], and townsfolk locked valuables and fragile objects away, after which the revelries would begin.
Crimmor was a city known for its numerous clubs, which stayed open and were bustling with customers during the entire festival.

==Activities==
For four days and four nights people would don masks and eccentric costumes, get drunk and perform acts of debauchery in public. Most of them would live in the streets for the duration of the festival, eating from street feasts during the evening and sleeping around bonfires on [[cloak]]s provided by the mayor.

For the duration of the festival, law enforcement was relaxed, and most small crimes were dismissed altogether: public debauchery was not only tolerated, but expected and celebrated. The Bargemen, [[Crimmor Guard|Guards]] and [[Shadow Thieves]] were nevertheless extremely vigilant during the festivities, preventing major issues from troubling the celebrations.
