The Unveiling was a horrific ceremony performed by worshipers of Gargauth every Midwinter night.
Many gruesome sacrifices occurred during this dark ceremony, heralding the looming unveiling of the "Lord Who Watches" and the "Lord of All." Gargauths faithful believed this would occur when the Hidden Lord seized all of Faer√ªn as his unholy realms and transported it to Baator as a new layer of the Nine Hells.
