of Kao II
The Dragon Boat Festival was a boat racing festival celebrated in Shou Lung. It took place on the 3 of Kao II of the Kara-Turan calendar.
At some point in the early 14 century DR, on the 3 day of Ju, the Shou governor Chan Sung Yu sent a group of adventurers up into the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains in search of the legendary Flowers of Flame. The governor instructed them to leave the next day and to try to return before the Dragon Boat Festival, which at that point was 90 days away.
