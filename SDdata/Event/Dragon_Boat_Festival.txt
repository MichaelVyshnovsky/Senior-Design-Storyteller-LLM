| basicrefs   = This festival is most likely derived from the festival of the same name that is annually celebrated in China on the 5 day of the 5 month. As per the name of the festival, it most likely involved the racing of dragon boats.While the specific day on which the Dragon Boat Festival takes place is not mentioned in any source, a rough estimate can be extrapolated from the adventure The Flowers of Flame. In that adventure, it is stated to start on the 3 day of Ju and that the festival is ninety days away. Adding up the remaining days of Ju, as well as the 30 day periods of Yu and Kao, we can come to the conclusion that the festival would fall on the 3 day of Kao II.

The Dragon Boat Festival was a boat racing festival celebrated in Shou Lung. It took place on the 3 of Kao II of the Kara-Turan calendar.
At some point in the early 14 century DR, on the 3 day of Ju, the Shou governor Chan Sung Yu sent a group of adventurers up into the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains in search of the legendary Flowers of Flame. The governor instructed them to leave the next day and to try to return before the Dragon Boat Festival, which at that point was 90 days away.
