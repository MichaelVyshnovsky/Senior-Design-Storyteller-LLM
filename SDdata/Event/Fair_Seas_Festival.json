        "mainbody": "The '''Fair Seas Festival''' was a two-day-long festival held in [[Waterdeep]] in the last two days of [[Ches]]. It marked the end of the [[Fleetswake]] festival and encompassed most of the holiday's religious significance.",
        "Description": "The festival was intended more as a prevention ritual rather than a celebration. It was meant to protect Waterdeep from the wrath of [[Umberlee]].",
        "Activities": "During the first day of the festival, the main activities were feasts in all of the city's taverns, almost exclusively involving seafood.\n\nDuring both days, [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] officers and members of both the [[Guild of Watermen]] and the [[Master Mariners' Guild]] toured the city from tavern to tavern collecting donations for Umberlee. Collection boxes were also placed at large gatherings for the festival and at both guilds' Guildhalls.\n\nOn the second day, [[cleric]]s from all temples in the city and members of the sea-related [[Guilds of Waterdeep|guilds]] spent the entire day on [[Deepwater Isle]] praying and fasting. At dawn and dusk, [[Deepwater Harbor]] was decorated with flower petals in homage to Umberlee.\n\nAt sunset on the second day, all donations were placed in chests and cast into the deepest part of the harbor. The treasure was added to [[Umberlee's Cache]], an enormous treasure pile that was closely guarded by [[merfolk]] and surrounded by myth and legend.",
        "History": "In the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], a temporary structure was built over the waters of [[Smugglers' Dock]] in the lower [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] during the holiday. It was used for a feast that [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]], [[Mirt]], and other [[Nobility of Waterdeep|nobles]] involved in maritime activities shared with the merfolk inhabitants of Deepwater Harbor.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, it was estimated that the amount of gold donated to Umberlee's Cache had surpassed 2,500,000 [[gp]]."
