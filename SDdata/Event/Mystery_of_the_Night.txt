The '''Mystery of the Night''' was a sacred ritual performed by followers of [[Selûne]], the Night White Lady.

==History==
It was required that every [[priest]] and priestess of Selûne perform the Mystery of the Night at least once per year. The Selûnite cast a series of secret [[spell]]s known only to Selûne's clergy. The priest then lay before an altar where their body flew up into the air to spiral around the moon. During their flight Selûne would converse with the priest personally through mental visions. The ritual was so physically draining that it actually caused a degree of harm to the priest's body, but would heal through normal or magical methods.
