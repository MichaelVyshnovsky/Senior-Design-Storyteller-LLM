The Mystery of the Night was a sacred ritual performed by followers of Selûne, the Night White Lady.
It was required that every priest and priestess of Selûne perform the Mystery of the Night at least once per year. The Selûnite cast a series of secret spells known only to Selûnes clergy. The priest then lay before an altar where their body flew up into the air to spiral around the moon. During their flight Selûne would converse with the priest personally through mental visions. The ritual was so physically draining that it actually caused a degree of harm to the priests body, but would heal through normal or magical methods.
