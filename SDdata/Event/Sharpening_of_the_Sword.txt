The Sharpening of the Sword was a religious festival observed by worshipers of Anhur, the General of the Gods within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
The Sharpening of the Sword occurred on Greengrass and marked the end of a month-long tournament that started in Tarsakh in what the Mulhorandi referred to as the Time of Storms. This date also was used to begin campaigns if Mulhorand was at war.
