The '''Birthing''' was a holy day observed by worshipers of [[Hathor]], the Nurturing Mother within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
The Birthing occurred annually on the first full moon following [[Greengrass]]. Many [[priestess]]es of Hathor gave birth around this time, making it a cause of great celebration. Hathor required her priestesses to reveal a new song, dance, or poem during the Birthing provided they were not in the final stages of pregnancy or actually giving birth.
