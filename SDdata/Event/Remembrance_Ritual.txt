The '''Remembrance Ritual''' was a religious celebration observed by worshipers of [[Anhur]], the General of the Gods within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==

The ritual concluded with a series of martial hymns thanking Anhur for any military victories that occurred during the past year.
