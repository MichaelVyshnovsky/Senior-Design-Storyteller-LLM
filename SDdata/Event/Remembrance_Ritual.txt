The Remembrance Ritual was a religious celebration observed by worshipers of Anhur, the General of the Gods within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
The Remembrance Ritual was observed during Highharvestide. A somber event, the Remembrance Ritual was used as a day of self-reflection and to remember fallen comrades. The ritual concluded with a series of martial hymns thanking Anhur for any military victories that occurred during the past year.
