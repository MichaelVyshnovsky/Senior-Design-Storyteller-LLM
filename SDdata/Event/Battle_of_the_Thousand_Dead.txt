The '''Battle of the Thousand Dead''' was a violent armed conflict that took place in the Archbarony of Blackmoor on the world of [[Oerth]].

==Description==
The famous hero [[Scaldulin]] of Blackmoor wielded his [[enchanted]] [[sword]] - the ''[[Hoarfrost Blade]]'', against a [[demon]] army. With the magics sealed within the blade that made it supremely effective agains outsiders, Scaldulin helped to stop the conflict. Many years later, seers and sages of the world of [[Toril]] were aware of Scaldulin's adventuring career and of the battle that raged on a far-off world.
