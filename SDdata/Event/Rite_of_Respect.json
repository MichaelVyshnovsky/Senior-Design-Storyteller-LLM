        "mainbody": "he Rite of Respect was a religious ritual observed by the clergy of Tiamat, the Dragon Queen within the Untheric pantheon.\nThis complicated ritual of abasement was performed any time a priest of Tiamat approached one of the Dragon Queens spawns. The Rite of Respect did not protect the priest from the spawns wrath, but failure to perform the ritual ensured their death at the hands, or fangs, of the spawn."
