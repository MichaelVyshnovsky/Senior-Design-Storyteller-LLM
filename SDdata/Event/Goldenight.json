The creatures caused the death of several patrons of the neighboring [[Purple Palace]]. When reporting the incident to the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], the proprietor [[Dandalus Ruell]] suggested that the creatures' ability to breach through the shop's magical defenses constituted foul play."
