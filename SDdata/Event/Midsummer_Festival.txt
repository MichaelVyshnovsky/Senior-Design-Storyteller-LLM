The Midsummer Festival was a festival held in the Plain of Horses. It was one of the more commonly observed among the few formal holidays and festivals held in that land.
Occurring around Kythorn 20,While this is undated and Torils calendars have different Midsummers, this is presumed to be the one immediately after spring, owing to the animals being born then. This is also the summer solstice, the traditional date for Midsummer on Earth, which is sometimes adopted in the Forgotten Realms. In any case, the Plain of Horses is unlikely to use Faer√ªns Calendar of Harptos, but the Kara-Turan calendar is not defined well enough. it was a week-long period of banqueting and celebrating livestock born in the spring.
