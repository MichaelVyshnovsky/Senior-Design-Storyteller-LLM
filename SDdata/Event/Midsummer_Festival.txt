The '''Midsummer Festival''' was a festival held in the [[Plain of Horses]]. It was one of the more commonly observed among the few formal holidays and festivals held in that land.

==Activities==
Occurring around [[Kythorn 20]],<ref group="note" name="date">While this is undated and Toril's calendars have different Midsummers, this is presumed to be the one immediately after spring, owing to the animals being born then. This is also the summer solstice, the traditional date for [[Wikipedia:Midsummer|Midsummer]] on Earth, which is sometimes adopted in the ''Forgotten Realms''. In any case, the Plain of Horses is unlikely to use [[Faer√ªn]]'s [[Calendar of Harptos]], but the [[Kara-Turan calendar]] is not defined well enough. it was a week-long period of banqueting and celebrating livestock born in the spring.
