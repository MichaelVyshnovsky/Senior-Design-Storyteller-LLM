        "mainbody": "he dinosaur races of Port Nyanzaru in Chult were one of that citys most famous attractions as of the late 15 century DR.\nThe races featured brightly painted dinosaurs ridden through the streets of Port Nyanzaru for the delight and gambling of onlookers. Racing dinosaurs were usually juveniles (as they were easier to train and manage) and usually had blunted claws and horns in addition to strong muzzles. In some cases, riders of smaller species were preferred to make smaller dinosaur runners competitive.\nRaces were held once each tenday, Each race day usually included three events a four-legged race (dominated by ankylosaurus, triceratops, and dimetrodon racers), a two-legged race (dominated by deinonychus and hadrosaurus racers), and an \"unchained\" race with no entry restrictions (dominated by allosaurus and tyrannosaurus racers). and did not need to be muzzled nor have their claws and horns trimmed, making these events much more dangerous for the dinosaurs and their riders. However, spectators were seldom injured. \nSpecial events could also include chariots or races through the Harbor (astride plesiosaurs) or through the air (on pteranodons). On occasion, small races were held within the Grand Coliseum as part of larger events these usually featured smaller allosauruses and riders who were encouraged to taunt, trip, and attack each other as they navigated around obstacles like blockades, mud pits, and nets.\nA usual racecourse started either at the Harbor or at the Tiryki Gate in the Market Ward. It wound through the streets of Port Nyanzaru passed the Harbor and around all four of the citys main hills (Mount Sibasa, Yklwazi Hill, Temple Hill, and Throne Hill).\nThe area of the Market Ward just inside the Tiryki Gate was a gathering place for bookies and gamblers.\nRacing was managed by teams, who were known to recruit from among daring adventurers as the races could be quite dangerous. e.g., the Green Vipers.\nBetting was managed by bookies, who accepted wagers of as little as a single copper piece and as large as 500 gold pieces. Gamblers could bet on a given dinosaur winning, placing, showing, or doing something specific during the race, such as attacking another racer or losing its rider. This meant that bookies would accept many different bets on a single race, and winnings were paid out based on the odds. Losing bettors were expected to pay their gambling debts promptly or else be visited by a \"legbreaker\".\nAs of the time of the death curse, crowd favorites at the races included Banana Candy, Big Honker, Bonecruncher, and Ubtaos Favorite. Less popular racers included Grung Stomper, Jungle Princess, Mountain Thunder, Nasty Boy, and Scarback.\nDuring this time, the Merchant Princes of the city arranged for a massive competition called Na Nbusos Haka, which featured land, air, and sea events all in one race. In the lead up to this festival, there was a suspicious uptick in longshot wins, mostly due to a number of dinosaur racers dying mysteriously."
