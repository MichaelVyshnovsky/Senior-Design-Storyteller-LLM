        "mainbody": "The '''dinosaur races''' of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] were one of that city's most famous attractions as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The races featured brightly painted [[dinosaur]]s ridden through the streets of Port Nyanzaru for the delight and gambling of onlookers. Racing dinosaurs were usually juveniles (as they were easier to train and manage) and usually had blunted claws and horns in addition to strong [[muzzle]]s. In some cases, riders of smaller species were preferred to make smaller dinosaur runners competitive.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|6}}\n\nRaces were held once each [[tenday]],{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|6}} Each race day usually included three events: a four-legged race (dominated by [[ankylosaurus]], [[triceratops]], and [[dimetrodon]] racers), a two-legged race (dominated by [[deinonychus]] and [[hadrosaurus]] racers), and an \"unchained\" race with no entry restrictions (dominated by [[allosaurus]] and [[tyrannosaurus]] racers). and did not need to be muzzled nor have their claws and horns trimmed, making these events much more dangerous for the dinosaurs and their riders. However, spectators were seldom injured. \n\nSpecial events could also include [[chariot]]s or races through the [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor]] (astride [[plesiosaur]]s) or through the air (on [[pteranodon]]s).{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|7-9}} On occasion, small races were held within the [[Grand Coliseum]] as part of larger events: these usually featured smaller allosauruses and riders who were encouraged to taunt, trip, and attack each other as they navigated around obstacles like blockades, mud pits, and [[net]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|16-17}}",
        "Location": "A usual racecourse started either at the Harbor or at the [[Tiryki Gate]]{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|4}} in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]]. It wound through the streets of Port Nyanzaru passed the Harbor and around all four of the city's main hills ([[Mount Sibasa]], [[Yklwazi Hill]], [[Temple Hill (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple Hill]], and [[Throne Hill]]).\n\nThe area of the Market Ward just inside the Tiryki Gate was a gathering place for bookies and gamblers.",
        "Activities": "Racing was managed by teams, who were known to recruit from among daring [[adventurer]]s as the races could be quite dangerous.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|21}} e.g., the [[Green Vipers]].{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|15}}\n\nBetting was managed by bookies, who accepted wagers of as little as a single [[copper piece]] and as large as 500 [[gold pieces]]. Gamblers could bet on a given dinosaur winning, placing, showing, or doing something specific during the race, such as attacking another racer or losing its rider. This meant that bookies would accept many different bets on a single race, and winnings were paid out based on the odds. Losing bettors were expected to pay their gambling debts promptly or else be visited by a \"legbreaker\".",
        "History": "As of the time of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} crowd favorites at the races included [[Banana Candy]], [[Big Honker]], [[Bonecruncher]], and [[Ubtao's Favorite]]. Less popular racers included [[Grung Stomper]], [[Jungle Princess]], [[Mountain Thunder]], [[Nasty Boy]], and [[Scarback]].\n\nDuring this time, the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|Merchant Princes]] of the city arranged for a massive competition called [[Na N'buso's Haka]], which featured land, air, and sea events all in one race. In the lead up to this festival, there was a suspicious uptick in longshot wins, mostly due to a number of dinosaur racers dying mysteriously."
