        "mainbody": "he Boreal Ball was an unending party hosted by the aptly named Baron of the Boreal Ball.\nThe Ball was a chance for revelry and intrigue in equal measure. Guests could dance, watch the dancing, or mingle with the various fey and other attendees. Guests jockeyed to make positive impressions on each other, or to discredit their rivals, hoping to earn the Barons favor.\nGuests for the Ball received magical invitations from the Baron, which let them know the appointed time at which they were to attend. At that time, they were then teleported to the party where they danced, schemed, or did whatever else they wished for three dances before the Baron arrived to greet them.\nThe ball was held at a palace of ice located within the Feywild.\nNotable attendees of the Ball included the satyr Cannifer, the drow Raxas Albrethin, the dryad Darisis, the pixie Fidget, the green hag Granny Snailtongue, and the hobgoblin Varka.\nAt some point, Minsc (and Boo) and Delina attended the Ball."
