        "Activities": "A novice needed to undergo the Transforming in order to be accepted as a full priest of Azuth. During this process the novice was ''[[Shapechange|shapechanged]]'' by a Master of Azuth for a period of ten days. The ''shapechange'' involuntarily changed forms during this time period, forcing the novice to experience the world as many different creatures. The novice usually spent this time in a walled-off part of a temple compound's garden. The special version of the ''shapechange'' [[spell]] used during the Transforming remained a secret known only by Masters of Azuth."
