The Day the Dead are Most With Us was an important religious event celebrated by followers of Myrkul, the Lord of Bones.
The Day the Dead are Most With Us was the only calendar-related event observed by Myrkuls faithul. It occurred on the Feast of the Moon. Myrkulytes believed that on this day the spirits of all the deceased rose to pass unseen throughout Faer√ªn, searching for any living descendants to communicate short messages with them by writing in dust, sand, or moving small objects. Myrkulytes celebrated this with prayer, song, and chants. This continued until midnight and another ritual called the Flagons of the Fallen.
