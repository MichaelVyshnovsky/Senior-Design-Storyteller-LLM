The '''Sacred Unmaking''' was a religious ceremony performed by worshipers of [[Gond]], the Wonderbringer.<ref name="FaA-p63" >

==Description==
Whenever a new tool or machine was successfully invented, the inventing [[Gond|Gondar]] was tasked with creating another copy of the item in question. One of the two copies was hidden from prying eyes, only to be shared with fellow Gondar. The remaining copy was destroyed, preferably by fire, while prayers of offering were chanted to the Wonderbringer. This ceremony was performed in order to show Gond's dominion over constructive and destructive engineering.
