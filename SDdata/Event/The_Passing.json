        "mainbody": "he Passing was a funeral ceremony performed when a member of Beshabas clergy died.\nThe Passing was a rare instance of compassion among Beshabas faithful. The body of the deceased was placed on a raft and floated down a river among floating candles. A unique spell was performed that transformed the body into an undead creature and teleported it to a random location on Toril where it would immediately begin to wreak havoc. Some senior members of the clergy would use magic to spy upon the undead creature to monitor its activities."
