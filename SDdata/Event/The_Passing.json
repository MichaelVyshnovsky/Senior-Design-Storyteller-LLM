        "Activities": "The Passing was a rare instance of compassion among Beshaba's faithful. The body of the deceased was placed on a raft and floated down a river among floating candles. A unique [[spell]] was performed that transformed the body into an [[undead]] creature and ''[[teleport]]ed'' it to a random location on [[Toril]] where it would immediately begin to wreak havoc. Some senior members of the clergy would use magic to spy upon the undead creature to monitor its activities."
