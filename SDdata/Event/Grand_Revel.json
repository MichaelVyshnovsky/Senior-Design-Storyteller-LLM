        "mainbody": "The '''Grand Revel''' was a holiday celebrated in [[Waterdeep]] on [[Alturiak 14]]. It consisted of numerous music and dance events, as well as the partaking of different kinds of sweet treats and traditional romantic getaways and exchanging of gifts by young couples.\n\n{{Quote|The Grand Revel is a time of beauty, celebration, and affection in all its forms.|[[Celeste]]}}",
        "Activities": "The holiday was organized by [[cleric]]s of [[Lliira]], [[Sharess]], and [[Sune]]. During the day, activities included large dancing rings on the streets for all ages, as well as dancing performances. After dusk, the holiday was celebrated with performances by [[bard]]s and minstrels for families, in events known as \"love feasts\".\n\nThroughout the holiday, traditional sweet treats of all kinds were consumed, ranging from [[chocolate]] to [[red firemint]] [[red firemint candy|candies]].\n\nIt was also common for couples to slip away during the evening to kiss and exchange love promises and gifts. The most common tokens that were given this way were [[ring]]s blessed by the clerics with faithfulness prayers.",
        "History": "During the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]'s campaign against the [[undead]] in [[Chult]], they took the opportunity to celebrate Grand Revel at [[Camp Vengeance]]. However, festivities were somewhat derailed when one of the [[templar]]s, [[Vanessa]], alerted them that a merchant caravan was overdue to arrive at the camp and had likely been lost in the jungle."
