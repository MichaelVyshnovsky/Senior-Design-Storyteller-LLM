        "mainbody": "The Grand Revel was a holiday celebrated in Waterdeep on Alturiak 14. It consisted of numerous music and dance events, as well as the partaking of different kinds of sweet treats and traditional romantic getaways and exchanging of gifts by young couples.\nThe holiday was organized by clerics of Lliira, Sharess, and Sune. During the day, activities included large dancing rings on the streets for all ages, as well as dancing performances. After dusk, the holiday was celebrated with performances by bards and minstrels for families, in events known as \"love feasts\".\nThroughout the holiday, traditional sweet treats of all kinds were consumed, ranging from chocolate to red firemint candies.\nIt was also common for couples to slip away during the evening to kiss and exchange love promises and gifts. The most common tokens that were given this way were rings blessed by the clerics with faithfulness prayers.\nDuring the Order of the Gauntlets campaign against the undead in Chult, they took the opportunity to celebrate Grand Revel at Camp Vengeance. However, festivities were somewhat derailed when one of the templars, Vanessa, alerted them that a merchant caravan was overdue to arrive at the camp and had likely been lost in the jungle."
