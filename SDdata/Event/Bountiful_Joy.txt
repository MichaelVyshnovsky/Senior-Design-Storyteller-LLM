The '''Bountiful Joy''' was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Geb]], the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
Every morning [[priest]]s of Geb would dig up a single stone while chanting morning prayers. The stone had been buried in the earth the night before. Along with a twin ceremony called the [[Hidden Gift]], the Bountiful Joy celebrated the discovery of precious assets found within the earth.
