The Bountiful Joy was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of Geb, the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Every morning priests of Geb would dig up a single stone while chanting morning prayers. The stone had been buried in the earth the night before. Along with a twin ceremony called the Hidden Gift, the Bountiful Joy celebrated the discovery of precious assets found within the earth.
