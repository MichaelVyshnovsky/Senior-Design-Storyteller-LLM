        "mainbody": "he Meeting of the Three, also referred to as the Howling, was an event that occurred in the Godswalk Keep in the Border Kingdoms.\nFor unknown reasons the avatar of Garagos sometimes appeared within the keep at night, slaying everything he could find. The avatars of Jergal and Sharess also appeared at this same time. The \"Howling\" moniker for the event occurred since Garagos would scream in frustration at not being able to kill Jergal and Sharess."
