The '''Jalesh Rudra''' was a holy celebration of the faithful of [[Silvanus]],{{cite book/Sentinelspire||19}} celebrated on the night of [[Tarsakh 19]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||20}}

During the Jalesh Rudra, priests sought out sacred groves, where they painted each other with the symbols of Silvanus, and made an offering of the leaves of [[oak]], [[ash]], and [[thorn]], preferably over running water.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||28}} If the celebrants were found worthy, the Oak Father's favor was shown by allowing the priests to commune (carnally) with the messengers; in some cases, magical items or even quests could also be given to the celebrants.

It also served as a coming of age ceremony for the faithful.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||Prologue}}
