        "mainbody": "The '''Divinity Plays''' were a series of performances performed and enjoyed by the [[Mulhorand]]i people on [[Midsummer]] each year. They were sponsored and organized by the churches of the realm.",
        "Activities": "Starting at dawn on Midsummer, actors throughout Mulhorand performed a series of plays that memorialized and celebrated [[Mulhorandi pantheon|their gods]]. The performances continued all day long until sunset.\n\n[[Bard]]s and other actors each portrayed the Mulhorandi gods―respectfully, but with humanity―as tradition dictated. The rigidity of [[Horus-Re]]'s outlook on life was scoffed at by other deities; [[Set]] always orchestrated impractical schemes that failed for his goals, but wound up benefiting Horus-Re.\n\nTo the joy of many, the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] were depicted as spoiled, incompetent fools.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a new performance entitled ''[[The Taking of Unther]]'' was added to the Divinity Plays. This play was a reenactment of the fall of [[Gilgeam]] and the salvation of the people from [[Unther]]."
