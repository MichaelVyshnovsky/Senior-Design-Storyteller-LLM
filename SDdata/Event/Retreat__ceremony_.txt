The Retreat was a religious ceremony observed by followers of the Red Knight.
The Retreat occurred annually every Midwinter day. The clergy of the Red Knight assembled for a retrospective over the past years military campaigns. They discussed strategies, analyzed the outcomes of battles, and added new insights into the Church of the Red Knights archives.
