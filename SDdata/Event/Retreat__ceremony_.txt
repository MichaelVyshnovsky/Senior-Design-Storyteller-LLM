The '''Retreat''' was a religious ceremony observed by followers of the [[Red Knight]].

==Description==
The Retreat occurred annually every [[Midwinter]] day. The clergy of the Red Knight assembled for a retrospective over the past year's military campaigns. They discussed strategies, analyzed the outcomes of battles, and added new insights into the [[Church of the Red Knight]]'s archives.
