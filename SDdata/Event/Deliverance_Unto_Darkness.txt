The '''Deliverance Unto Darkness''' was a religious event observed by worshipers of [[Ibrandul]], the Lord of the Dry Depths.

==Description==
Ibrandul's faithful observed this ceremony on [[Midwinter]]'s Eve. They thanked their [[god]] for rescuing from the hands of the wicked [[drow]]. The sacrifice of a creature sacred to the drow and [[Lolth]], such as a [[giant spider]], was performed along with the casting of the ''[[dark path]]'' [[spell]]. Chains of Ibrandul's faithful would then walk through the [[Underdark]], aided by the powers granted by the spell and trusting in Ibrandul to protect them from harm.
