        "mainbody": "The '''Embracing''' was the most sacred ritual performed by worshipers of [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden.",
        "Activities": "The Embracing was performed by postulates when they were admitted to Auril's clergy. Though the ritual could occur at any time of the year, a postulate was required to travel north to arctic regions or a high mountain in order to find a blizzard. The postulate would run throughout the night within the blizzard wearing only boots, a thin shift, and body paint depicting the symbols of Auril. The postulate would either die of exposure to the extreme cold, or be accepted by Auril and blessed with her gift and become immune to the cold."
