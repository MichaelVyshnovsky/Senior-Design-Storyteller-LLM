The '''Invocation''' was a sacred holy ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Leira]], the Lady of the Mists.

==History==
The Invocation was performed when Leira's direct guidance was desired. Participating [[priest]]s chanted and swung censers that made a thick smoke from which Leira could appear to her followers.
