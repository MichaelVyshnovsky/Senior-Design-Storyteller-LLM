The '''Test of Venom''' was a religious ceremony observed by worshipers of [[Set]], the Defiler of the Dead within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
Supplicants wishing to join Set's brotherhood of followers were required to undergo the initiation ceremony called the Test of Venom. During the ceremony supplicants walked through a pit filled with venomous [[snake]]s and [[scorpion]]s. If they survived they were permitted to join the brotherhood of Set's clergy.
