        "mainbody": "'''The Retreat''' was the name given to the mass migration of [[elf|elves]] from [[Faerûn]] to the Green Isle of [[Evermeet]] in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}. It was instigated by the [[Elven Court]],{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|70}} after years of thought and mediation by the leaders of the elf nations.<ref> During the Retreat, over ninety percent of the elves in the forest of [[Cormanthor]] migrated to Evermeet or [[Evereska]].",
        "History": "When the elves abandoned the forests, they left behind legions of [[green warder]]s, who continued to guard the burial sites and ancient groves that the elves had forsaken.<ref name=MC.MoF-p57>\n\nAs they had no loyalty to the Elven Court, the [[Llewyrr]] elves of the [[Moonshae Isles]] largely did not join the Retreat.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[Cambrizym]] of [[Candlekeep]] wrote that the Retreat had come to an end, though not by official proclamation but rather through having reached its own tipping point, by which almost all who had meant to leave had already done so, leaving only a few lonely pilgrims to make the journey by themselves. Shortly thereafter, the Retreat began to reverse itself, with many from Evermeet returning to [[Sword Coast|Faerûn's shores]]."
