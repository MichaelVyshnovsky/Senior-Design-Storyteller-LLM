During the Retreat, over ninety percent of the elves in the forest of Cormanthor migrated to Evermeet or Evereska.\nWhen the elves abandoned the forests, they left behind legions of green warders, who continued to guard the burial sites and ancient groves that the elves had forsaken.\nAs they had no loyalty to the Elven Court, the Llewyrr elves of the Moonshae Isles largely did not join the Retreat.\nIn the , Cambrizym of Candlekeep wrote that the Retreat had come to an end, though not by official proclamation but rather through having reached its own tipping point, by which almost all who had meant to leave had already done so, leaving only a few lonely pilgrims to make the journey by themselves. Shortly thereafter, the Retreat began to reverse itself, with many from Evermeet returning to Faerûns shores."
