'''Ahghairon's Day''' was a holiday in [[Waterdeep]], celebrated on the [[Eleasis 1|first]] of [[Eleasis]], to honor the city's first Lord, [[Ahghairon]].

==Celebration==
While the city maintained its civic operations, the [[Lord's Court]] would close and the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Open Lord]] would visit local taverns and greet the city's citizens. They were greeted by toasts to the City's Lords and [[bard]]s singing ballads to honor the "Old Mage" Ahghairon. Waterdhavians would leave [[violet]]s at [[Ahghairon's Tower]], the [[Plinth]] or at the various altars within the [[House of Wonder]].
