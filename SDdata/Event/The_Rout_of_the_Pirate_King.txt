'''The Rout of the Pirate King''' was the event that took place in the city of [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] in [[1182 DR]].

==History==
In its past, the city of Westgate was known for its lenient attitude towards visitors, be they, adventurers or buccaneers. In the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, these lax policies were taken advantage of by the infamous Pirate King [[Immurk]] and his gang of buccaneers. The  Pirate King hatched a daring ploy to assemble a large contingent of his men in Westgate and attempt to steal the entirety of the city's naval fleet. Immurk's pirates were successful in taking over several vessels, but they promptly were sunk by a barrage of ''[[fireball]]s'' and ''[[smokepowder]]'' kegs fired at them by the remaining navy.

The event was commemorated in the form of a miniature diorama displayed in the [[Harbormaster's Office]] of Westgate, along with other naval museum memorabilia.
