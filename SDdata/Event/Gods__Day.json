        "mainbody": "ods Day was an annual holiday in Waterdeep that commemorated the anniversary of the end of the Time of Troubles in the . It was held on Marpenoth 15.\nThe holiday was considered a solemn and serious event, especially at night, when Waterdhavians offered prayers in the citys temples to thank the gods for their lives and in remembrance of the catastrophic events of the Time of Troubles.\nThe holiday was particularly special to followers of Mystra. A huge festival was held at the House of Wonder, specifically celebrating Midnights elevation as the new Mystra. By the late 14 century DR, this practice had gradually begun to be adopted in other temples dedicated to Mystra throughout Faer√ªn.\nDuring the day, a common custom involved people wearing their favored deities holy symbols and exposing their private shrines, as well as businesses displaying them in the windows. Customers who worshiped matching deities with their merchants enjoyed discounted prices on products and services, and the difference was donated to temples or to the city itself.\nDuring the night festivities, the Griffon Cavalry set up a large bonfire at the top of Mount Waterdeep to honor the deities who appeared in the city during the conflict, namely, Ao, Cyric, Helm, Kelemvor, Myrkul, and Mystra.\nIt was customary for people to decorate the inner walls of Waterdeep with garlands as part of the celebrations. The holiday was also semi-officially called Be Kind to the Guard and Watch Day as a form of gratitude for the efforts of the City Guard and the City Watch to defend the city during Myrkuls invasion of the Castle, Dock, and Southern Wards. Waterdhavians typically offered kind words to guardsmen and watchmen, as well as gifts. It was considered improper, however, to give any donation worth more than a few nibs, as it might be interpreted as bribery.\nDuring the entire day, in memory of the wild magic that accompanied the Time of Troubles, the use of magic of any sort within the confines of the city was limited to self-defense and cases of extreme need only. Individual cases were adjudicated by the Lords Court.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the City of the Dead saw a considerable increase in visitation by people who had lost loved ones during the conflict."
