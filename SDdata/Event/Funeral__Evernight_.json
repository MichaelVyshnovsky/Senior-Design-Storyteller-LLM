        "mainbody": "\"funeral\" was a nightmarish execution carried out by the ghoulish denizens of Evernight if ever they captured a living humanoid in their city. It blended the ghouls cannibalistic hunger with their religious faith.\nLiving people were generally regarded as food to the undead inhabitants of Evernight unless they had been granted citizenship by the ruling tribunal. However, if a ghoul captured a humanoid in the city, it would generally not eat that humanoid immediately unless they were particularly ravenous. Instead, the victim was delivered to the priests at the Temple of Filth for a funeral service that would result in them being buried alive to die slowly. Only once their corpse had begun to rot was it reclaimed and eaten.\n\"Funerals\" required the soon-to-be-deceased to look their best, and so they were first taken to Lamanthas mortuary to be sedated (with a paralytic agent derived from ghouls humors), cleaned, and dressed in fine clothing.\nThe service at the Temple as well as the trip to the Graveyard were performative religious affairs. Prayers were made to ask for blessings from Doresain during the funeral ceremony, and the formal procession to bury the victim included triumphant songs honoring both Doresain and Orcus. \nAs of , quite a few of Evernights living visitors were unfortunate enough to be given a funeral."
