        "mainbody": "The name of the first Green Regent was lost in the mists of history, though it was thought Mielikki had not begun to choose them before humans of Illusk first settled the Savage Frontier, some time after . Several Green Regents were known to have come from the Kingdom of Athalantar, called the Realm of the Stag, which stood from  to .\nFollowing Tethyrian settlement around the Delimbiyr River, these people too were included in Mielikkis dream. Green Regents were known to be active in Delimbiyran, the Kingdom of Man, which stood from  to , and in the Tricrowned Kingdom of Phalorm, of which Delimbiyran was a part and which stood from  to . Though these realms too collapsed in time and civilization in the Delimbiyr Vale divided into various city-states, like Calandor, Loravatha, Scathril and others, the Green Regents went on defending the forests, Mielikkis dream, and the peoples of the vale.\nThough the line of Green Regents had lasted for many centuries, it was interrupted only a few times. Seeing the Forest Queens Green Regents and their Scions as threats to their reign, the Renshas banned the selection ceremony and hunted down any that they found. These persecutions continued for several years, before the Green Regents vanished for more than a century. The Renshas made Loudwater more prosperous and expanded its connections with the outside world, but at the cost of exploiting the Vales natural resources and despoiling much of the pristine beauty of the area. Under them, without the Green Regents to stop them, loggers cleared the forests away from the river and farmers claimed the land for agriculture, while miners strip-mined the mountains, all at a shocking pace, and the wealth flowed down the river and out of the vale.\nFinally, in the , Pasuuk Rensha hired a band of talented mercenary hunters to obtain a unicorns horn. They hunted high and low for weeks, tracked it down, and finally tricked it into teleporting into a trap theyd set at a treacherous bend in the river known as Unicorn Run. Ordered by the companys captain, the newest member, Nanathlor Greysword, stepped forth and raised his sword to slay the unicorn—and hesitated, his heart breaking as he gazed into its eyes. Instead, Nanathlor turned back to his comrades, with sword still raised, and vowed he would not kill such a magnificent beast and that he would defend it against all that would despoil it. Twelve hunters joined him, and together they mutinied against their captain. Afterward, the markings of the Green Regent crawled over Nanathlors body, his fellows received the unicorn symbol on their foreheads, and the unicorn revealed itself to be the avatar of Mielikki. For their courage, shed made Nanathlor the new Green Regent and those who stood with him Scions, the first in over a century and a half. Furthermore, she asked Nanathlor and his comrades to liberate the Delimbiyr Vale from the rule of the Renshas.It should be noted this is obviously outside the traditional four-yearly Shieldmeet schedule, so Nanathlors term of office is unclear.\nIn what became known as the War of the Returned Regent, Nanathlor and his followers waged war against Pasuuk Rensha and his diabolical allies. Their victory came two years later at the Battle of Tanglefork. Here, the Green Regent called on Mielikki for aid, and she awakened the trees around the battlefield and set them to attack Pasuuks forces. Ultimately, Mielikkis servants were victorious and the devils and Pasuuk were all killed in the fighting.\nWith the fall of the Renshas and the end of the War of the Returned Regent, Nanathlor assumed rulership of Loudwater in the . The Green Regent turned High Lord maintained relations with other lands but ended the Renshas rampant logging and strip-mining, thus restoring the ecology and fertility of the land and in turn leading the vale into a new age of prosperity.\nThough Nanathlor soon after ceased to be Green Regent, over a dozen would follow him within his lifetime.\nIn the , Kalahar Twohands was chosen as Green Regent. Kalahar retired as Green Regent on Shieldmeet of the .The dates are not specified, but may be inferred from the battle being 25 years before a setting date of 1372 DR, estimated to be 1347 DR, and the Shieldmeets immediately before and after.\nA philosopher and wizard, Galaer Grasswave was chosen to be Green Regent in the . Galaer and the Scions were engaged in certain vital rituals on Standing Stone Hill to repair the citys magical wards when, on the Night of the Blood Moon in the , Malarite lycanthropes attacked Loudwater. Galaer could not halt nor pause the rituals for wards that might yet protect Loudwater, and so was forced to divide both his attention and his forces, keeping half the available Scions to defend the hill and sending the other half to defend the folk of Loudwater. More than three-quarters of the Scions fell to the lycanthropes in two nights of fighting, but they prevented interruption of the ritual and saved many folk from Malarite depredations. But on the third night, the Malarites targeted Standing Stone Hill and the Green Regents ritual. When they overran the citys defenses, they killed Galaer and mounted his head on a stake outside the northeastern earthen ramparts of the city. His cut-short reign meant a Green Regent was absent for three years.\nThe next Green Regent was chosen on Shieldmeet of the . Stedd Rein, a hero of the Night of the Blood Moon, was considered the favorite to become a Scion or even Green Regent, but he was rejected for both roles, stunning many in town. Shock after shock came when a band of High Forest orcs showed up and the young chieftain Otar drank the Greendraught and was accepted as a Scion. When Otar walked out of the High Forest the next day displaying the marks of the Green Regent, there was horror and outage.—the Beutaleendals claimed it was evidence of the ceremony being tainted or sabotaged, while the Phelaniityrs held it up as proof of the Reins inherent wickedness, but paradoxically maintained the ceremony had also been sabotaged to admit Otar. A few even doubted the validity of all the Scions, which nearly everyone rejected as ridiculous. Notoriously, family patriarch Halitan Phelaniityr vowed to rectify the situation before the Grayvale became, in his words, a \"cesspool of bestial orcish scum.\" Fearing violence might follow, the orcs, druids, and new Green Regent returned to the High Forest, leaving the Scions leaderless and people in Loudwater angry or afraid or else just waiting and wondering what Mielikki had in store. Generally, their faith in her was not broken, but, regardless of their acceptance of past Green Regents, they were reminded not even the gods were infallible, after the Northern saying, \"While the wise may worship, only fools bow and wait.\" With the Green Regent absent, the Scions acted independently.\nthumb|left|250px|Otar the Green Regents reaction to all this.\nIn the months after, rumors flourished, with some claiming Otar and his orcs were in hiding while plotting to attack and sack the city, but others insisted they guarded the city in secret, and still others that he had been murdered by the same anti-orc killer operating around the Red Boar Tavern, who might be a Mielikkian set on \"making things right\". Otar was, for all intents and purposes, missing.\nThe Green Regents were praised in many songs known in the area, and their history was documented in several books, yet little of either said anything of how they came to be. The origins of the Green Regent was a much-sought-after and highly valued piece of lore. Hence, the Green Regents and their history were the subject of much research and speculation, not least because much of it had not been written down. The bard Teseryne Truesilver wrote much on the matter and Mikal the Sage was fascinated by everything to do with the Green Regents. Mikal worked to compile a complete and definitive history. A lost and little-known tome entitled The Legacy of the Green Regent seemed the very best resource, including much secret history and three heretofore unknown early Green Regents.\n* Nanathlor Greysword, circa 1315 DR, ended the Rensha Rule and restored the Green Regents later High Lord of Loudwater\n* Kalahar Twohands, 1344–1348, destroyer of the Tempest later High Lord of Loudwater\n* Galaer Grasswave, 1368–1369, a philosopher-mage slain in the Night of the Blood Moon\n* Otar, 1372–, a High Forest orc, which caused much controversy"
