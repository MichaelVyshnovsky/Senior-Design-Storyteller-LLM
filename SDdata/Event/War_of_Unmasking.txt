The War of Unmasking was a conflict between the Thindolese and yuan-ti of House Sseradess on the Chultan Peninsula.
By pure chance, a scandal within Thindols royal court in Thindar in the , led to the "unmasking" of hundreds of yuan-ti agents who had secretly infiltrated the court. The reigning monarch at the time, as well as his entire family, were revealed to be yuan-ti. The entire country descended into anarchy. For months afterward, anyone suspected of possessing serpentine blood was rounded up and executed. While the executions severely weakened the yuan-tis influence in Thindol, they also resulted in the deaths of countless innocents along the way.
The War of Unmasking ended the monarchy in Thindol and established the Council of Cities, a ruling body of government, in its stead. The Council was determined to guard Thindols borders and prevent another surge of yuan-ti infiltrators. Sadly, they failed to realize that the yuan-ti would remain cleverly hidden beneath the waters of the Thingulph found at the heart of the country.
In addition to the overhaul of government within the country, the War of Unmasking led to Western Thindols splitting from the rest of the country to form their own independent nation that would be called Samarach.
