The Foreshadowing was a religious event observed by worshipers of Ibrandul, the Lord of the Dry Depths.
The Foreshadowing occurred only on nights when the clouds covered the new moon, cloaking the land in utter darkness. Ibrandulins priests would emerge from the depths at midnight, enacting the ritual that celebrated their gods promise to one day cover all of the land in darkness.
