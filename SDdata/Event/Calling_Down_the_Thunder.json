        "Activities": "The faithful of Talos enjoyed using lighting strikes to display their god's power on all occasions, but during this sacred ritual an intelligent sacrifice was struck dead by lightning in exchange for a favor from Talos. The favor was usually the brief ability to cast a [[spell]] beyond the participant's normal skill, but sometimes a deadly storm was sent to target a specific area selected by the [[Talassan]]."
