        "Description": "This ceremony was always preceded by responsive reading and chanting that went on for an hour. Afterwards, the waterwalker would summon a water elemental and be carried by them on a riding across the waves of a large body of water. When the waterwalker finally returned from their ride, various gifts would be bestowed upon the water elemental. These included [[garland]]s of flowers, drafts of fine [[wine]], and beautiful pieces of [[jewelry]], pottery, or sculpture. These were said to be carried away by the water elemental back to the [[Sea of Timelessness]], the [[divine realm]] of Istishia."
