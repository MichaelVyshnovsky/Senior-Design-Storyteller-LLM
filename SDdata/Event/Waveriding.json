Afterwards, the waterwalker would summon a water elemental and be carried by them on a riding across the waves of a large body of water. When the waterwalker finally returned from their ride, various gifts would be bestowed upon the water elemental. These included garlands of flowers, drafts of fine wine, and beautiful pieces of jewelry, pottery, or sculpture. These were said to be carried away by the water elemental back to the Sea of Timelessness, the divine realm of Istishia."
