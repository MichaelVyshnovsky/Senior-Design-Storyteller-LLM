        "Description": "Due to his tremendous power and tyrannical nature, the high priest of [[Shar]] was feared as much as he was hated. During the {{YearlinkName|446}} his grandchildren allied with several of his enemies, from disgruntled mages to rulers whose thrones were usurped. The motley alliance ambushed him, and managed to kill him in a massive conflagration of magic, which ended most of them as well.",
        "Location": "The ''Night of Dark Fire'' happened in a place of power sacred to [[Selûne]]. The exact location has been lost to the ages, but Gorothir was known to be active in and around [[Netheril]].",
        "Outcome": "After this victory an [[archmage]] of Selûne shattered the ''[[Shadowstaff of Gorothir]]'', losing his life in the process. As for [[Gorothir's Girdle]], it was salvaged by one of his descendants and played a major part in the history of the [[Church of Shar]] afterwards."
