        "mainbody": "The '''Great Plague of the Inner Sea''', also called the '''Great Inner Sea Plague''' or the '''Dragon Plague''', referred to a 6&ndash;7 year period beginning in the {{YearlinkName|1317}} when at least three separate [[disease]]s ravaged the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].",
        "Location": "The various diseases of the Great Plague spread across the northern and southern coasts of the Inner Sea, ravaging [[Aglarond]], [[Chessenta]], [[Impiltur]], [[Unther]], [[The Vast]], the [[Vilhon Reach]], and the [[Wizards' Reach]]. The neighboring realms of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Thay]] were largely unaffected.",
        "History": "Beginning in 1317 DR, a [[dragon]] known as the [[Wandering Wyrm]] appeared in the east of the Inner Sea and spread plagues everywhere it went. It left Aglarond beset by a ravaging disease, and beginning in Impitur, it began spreading an entirely different affliction that first infested the infected with [[maggot]]s before transforming them into [[undead]] horrors. The Wyrm then moved westward, where its disease found its way to [[Tsurlagol]] in The Vast and threatened to infect [[Procampur]].\n\nEfforts to fight the Wandering Wyrm were futile, as was demonstrated when it annihilated a legion of [[pegasus]]-mounted knights sent by King [[Rilimbrar]] of Impiltur. The Wyrm killed them and sent their reanimated corpses to ravage [[Lyrabar]]. Fear among the people in cities of The Vast led them to be willing to turn on each other to protect themselves. \n\nAlso beginning in 1317 DR, lands on the southern coast of the Inner Sea were ravaged by the [[Plague of Dragons]], most notably Chessenta, Unther, and [[Turmish]] (followed soon by the rest of the Vilhon Reach), although it was unclear if this was also caused by the Wandering Wyrm By {{Yearlink|1320}}, this disease had crossed into the Wizards' Reach, causing great social upheaval and prompting Thay to withdraw from an ongoing occupation of the region to protect itself. That same year, Queen [[Ilione Olósynne]] of Aglarond died of the plague ravaging her land, making her the last [[Olósynne Dynasty|Olósynne]] monarch.\n\nWhile the plagues were said to have ended in most places by the {{YearlinkName|1323}}, disease persisted through the [[1324 DR|following year]] in Chessenta and Unther.",
        "Outcome": "The plague took a huge toll in the [[Old Empires]], where Chessenta was decimated and Unther suffered heavily, and couriers from infected [[Unthalass]] were responsible for spreading it even to places like the [[Citadel of Black Ash]].<ref group=\"note\">In an apparent error or typo, ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' dates the Great Plague of the Inner Sea to [[1311 DR]]. \n\nSome blamed the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] for the plagues while others laid the blame on [[Talona]], the [[goddess]] of diseases, who was known to inflict pestilence on [[Faerûn]] when she felt that her worship was dwindling. Sure enough, veneration of Talona was said to have reached its height by the end of the Great Plague as people flocked to her for forgiveness and protection.\n\nIn the Wizards' Reach, despite the social unrest caused by the plague, cities like [[Escalant]] celebrated their newfound independence following the departure of the Thayans."
