All of the dwarves except usâ€”except the [[Duergar]]. Once again, the gray dwarves were cheated out of what every other dwarf benefited from. That seems to be our lot in life, though we don't deserve it. I expected no less.|Justikar Stoneblood}}",
        "History": "Moradin called a council of the dwarven pantheon to find a way to increase the number of dwarves. The council decided to split each existing soul into two when they were reincarnated.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|1625}}  After the Thunder Blessing most dwarven births were twins.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|651}}<ref group=\"note\">[[The Grand History of the Realms]] says that nearly one in five dwarven births resulted in twins, either identical or fraternal, which is clearly not \"most\".\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], [[Adnama Stoneblood]], a [[duergar]] scholar and dreamer was researching the history of the dwarves, trying to find the reason for the grey dwarves' exclusion from the Thundering. He uncovered the possible offshoot of duergars inhabiting the lava-filled caverns under [[Thaymount]] and headed out to rejoin the grey dwarves to increase their dwindling population. He was slain during the expedition, prompting his brother, [[Justikar Stoneblood]] to resume the search on his own."
