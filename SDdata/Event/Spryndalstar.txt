Spryndalstar was an annual Waukeenar high festival celebrated by the church and Waukeens worshipers across the Realms on the 7 of Eleint.
Spryndalstar was held in celebration of the Art, those who wielded it, and the keen ideas of wizards whose skills with the arcane enriched and improved lives of worshipers of Waukeen and common folk of the Realms. During Spryndalstar, temples of Waukeen and individual members of the clergy invested into mages and sponsored their activities. Additionally, Waukeenar hired spellcasters to dazzle and entertain folk during the celebrations.
