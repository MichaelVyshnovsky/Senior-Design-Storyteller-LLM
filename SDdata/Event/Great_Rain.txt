The '''Great Rain''' was a weather event that was part of the [[Second Sundering]] from the autumn of [[1485 DR]] to late [[1486 DR]].

A mystical event, meant to heal the wounds of the [[Spellplague]], it nevertheless caused crops to fail and with them caused widespread hunger. A magical ritual conducted by the elder circle of the [[Emerald Enclave]] and the [[chosen]] of [[Lathander]], [[Stedd Whitehorn]], at first hastened the rains and then brought them to an end, but not before raising the sea level of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] roughly back to what it was before the Spellplague. It also magically restored the farmlands and crops of the country.
