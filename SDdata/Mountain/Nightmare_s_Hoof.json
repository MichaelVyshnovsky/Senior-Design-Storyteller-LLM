        "Geographical features": "The Nightmare's Hoof was known for its numerous small but active volcanoes, and for the rumors about an extensive clan of [[fire giant]]s dwelling within the mountains. The mountains were rich in ore deposits, including [[gold]] and high-quality [[iron]]. Sambrese [[dwarves]] founded many outposts in the mountains to mine those deposits.\n\nOne of the most infamous mountains of the Nightmare's Hoof was [[Achazar's Throne]], that was located close to Sambral.\n\nThere was a heavily patrolled pass through the Nightmare's Hoof that connected Sambral overland to [[Harglast]] and the other Windrise Ports."
