'''Wei Do Peak''' was a mountain in the eastern [[Vorkani Mountains]] in the realm of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

Each year after he took the throne in the 1350s [[DR]], a three-day-long ceremony was held on Wei Do Peak to honor King [[Wanang Sun]] and his new dynasty. Many [[monk]]s and [[shukenja]] attended the festival, and bestowed blessings on the king and his court. It culminated with the king himself ritually beheading the most infamous criminal in the kingdom's prisons. This act symbolized his power to defeat evil in the kingdom.

It was rumored that when the king wielded the [[Golden Sword of Ammatok]] to do this duty, a spirit of the [[Celestial Empire|Celestial Heavens]] would appear beside him and consecrate his rule under their guidance.
