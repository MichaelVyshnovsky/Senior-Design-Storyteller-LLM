'''Mount Ulaarn''' was a peak in the central [[Alimir Mountains]].

==Description==
This mountain was located in the central Alimirs between Mounts [[Mount Kahdas|Kahdas]] and [[Mount Phevos|Phevos]]. It was famous for being the site of [[Azure Falls]], the start of the [[Maridflow]].

==History==
7,000 years before the late fourteenth century [[DR]], two [[marid]]s, [[Haj]] and [[Luar]], were slain here, and their deaths caused a rift in Mount Ulaarn that led to the formation of the falls.
