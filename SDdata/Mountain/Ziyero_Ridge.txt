'''Ziyero Ridge''', also called '''Zigero Range''', was a mountain range running through [[Koguryo]] in [[Koryo]].<ref group="note">The range is called "Ziyero Ridge" in the ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' but "Zigero Range" in ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]''. The latter name is presumed to be in error, but they may represent different parts of the mountains.

==Locations==
The vast [[Dang Caverns]] lay beneath the range's northern tip.

==Creatures==
The mountains were heavily populated by [[foo dog]]s, [[foo lion]]s, and [[griffon]]s. It was not uncommon for dauntless folk to try to steal a pup, cub, or egg of these creatures in order to raise it as a dangerous yet loyal mount.
