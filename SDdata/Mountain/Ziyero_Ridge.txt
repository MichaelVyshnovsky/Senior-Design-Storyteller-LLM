Ziyero Ridge, also called Zigero Range, was a mountain range running through Koguryo in Koryo.The range is called "Ziyero Ridge" in the Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms but "Zigero Range" in The Forgotten Realms Atlas. The latter name is presumed to be in error, but they may represent different parts of the mountains.
The vast Dang Caverns lay beneath the ranges northern tip.
The mountains were heavily populated by foo dogs, foo lions, and griffons. It was not uncommon for dauntless folk to try to steal a pup, cub, or egg of these creatures in order to raise it as a dangerous yet loyal mount.
