        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1275}}, King [[Lashilmbrar]] commissioned a mercenary band known as the [[Gauntlet of Doom]] to explore the area around Redfang Peak as part of a longstanding effort to find any trace of King [[Imbrar I]], who disappeared somewhere in the area during the {{YearlinkName|1127}}. While the mercenaries never returned to Impiltur, their captain, [[Delros Parander]], was subsequently seen wielding the famous royal Impilturan [[sword]] known as ''[[Malagar]]'', which he presumably discovered while on that expedition."
