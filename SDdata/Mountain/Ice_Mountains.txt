==Inhabitants==
Humans were rarely encountered among these mountains, other than members of the [[Red Tiger tribe]] and merchants traveling from [[Sundabar]]. Dwarves often traveled through these mountains in search of the lost dwarf strongholds of Delzoun and would treat strangers with suspicion, fearing they may be treasure hunters.

In terms of [[giant]]s, this mountain range was inhabited by [[frost giant]]s, [[verbeeg]], and [[fog giant]]s.

[[White dragon]]s commonly vied for dominion in this region.

==Rumors & Legends==
Legends claimed that an ancient [[silver dragon]] roamed these mountains with his [[bronze dragon]] companion in the guise of an old hunter and his hound.
