        "mainbody": "he Web Mountains was a mountainous area in the Utter East, lying where the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains joined the World Pillar Mountains.Comparing the game map in Blood & Magic with standard maps of the region shows that the Web Mountains lie in the location described. The Web Mountains served as a pass between these ranges.\nThe Web Mountains were defined by a complex maze of gorges constantly filled with dense mist. A river ran through these gorges, fed by a small waterfall in the northwest. In these gorges there sometimes rose stacked pillars of massive boulders. Between the gorges, the land comprised an array of small, high, steep-sided plateaus. Travelers and armies could cross between plateaus via a series of shabby wooden bridges, both beam bridges and simple suspension bridges. Needless to say, it was easy to get lost in such a place.\nThe land was dry and rocky with occasional conifer trees, some alive and some dead. A forest of them grew in the southeast.\nBeefy, club-wielding trolls stood their ground in the Web Mountains. Rocs made their great nests on the high plateaus.\nthumb|right|Roxanna of Edenvale facing an opposing army in the Web Mountains.\nDuring the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR),The events of Blood & Magic are only dated to \"before the Time of Troubles\" (1358 DR) in game. It is assumed these are a part of the Bloodforge Wars described in Faces of Deception and dated in The Grand History of the Realms. the Web Mountains were the site of bloodforge battles fought between Roxanna, princess of Edenvale, and the suitors who sought to win her hand in marriage, in the conflict known as Matchmaker Mayhem. At one point, Roxanna might have retreated into the Web Mountains to avoid assaults on Edenvale Castle, but Connor the Clever would pursue them. At another point, Roxanna and Bryan the Bold might have competed to seize the others treasures hidden in the Web Mountains.\nSome time after, Olgala Zug laid claim to the pass and extracted a toll from travelers. However, the leader of the Legendary Campaign elected to fight a bloodforge battle against Zug instead.\nLater, one Dawn MacDare made camp in the Web Mountains, from which they advanced on the Legendary Campaign forces, desiring to take advantage of the leaders mission to unify and pacify the Utter East through conquest. Warned of the attack by the armys southern guard, the leader struck at MacDares forces in a bloodforge battle.\nFinally, the leader of the Legendary Campaign pursued Anson Darkeye into the Web Mountains, but became lost. Darkeye turned the tables and turned back on the Legendary Campaign, forcing them into a defensive bloodforge battle."
