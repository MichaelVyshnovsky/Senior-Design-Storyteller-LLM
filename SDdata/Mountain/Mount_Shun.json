It was commonly included in the background of paintings of UChan Gompa as part of the Po Yul Dzayul Range, visible in the distance and appearing mysterious.\nA famed temple of the Tabotan Way of Enlightenment stood here. It was reputedly where the Holy Mysteries of the faith unfolded, where the lances of Tabja Rung were forged, and where demons were defeated.\nIn , lightning reportedly blasted the image of HDang Li, the first High Lord of Oceans of Tabot, into an altar in the temple on Mount Shun, during ceremonies at the end of an annual pilgrimage. The lamas who witnessed it declared it a sign of his special favor and thus demanded privileges, but rivals were suspicious of this miracle."
