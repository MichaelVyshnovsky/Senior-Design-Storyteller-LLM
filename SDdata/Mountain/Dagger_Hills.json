        "Description": "In the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], the sparse [[human]] settlements, mostly small farms, dwindled during the [[Zhent]] occupation of Daggerdale and the hills became covered with dense thickets and thorn fields, resistant to fire and human intrusion. Many monsters hunted in these hills: wolves, [[leucrotta]]s, [[owlbear]]s, [[lycanthrope]]s, and even [[beholder]]s.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], the lycanthrope presence became prominent and by [[1479 DR]] these hills were infested mainly by murderous lycanthropes and their thralls. Despite the threat of the lycanthropes, small villages, protected by stockades, and farms still existed in the Dagger Hills.",
        "Locations": "In the south-western part of the Dagger Hills, not far from the [[River Ashaba]], lay the ruins of [[Castle Daggerdale]], the seat of the ruling family of Daggerdale, the [[Morn]]s. During his heroic resistance against the Zhent occupation, [[Randal Morn]] often made camp here with his men. Rumors about the hidden treasure of the Morn family, hidden in a bricked tunnel in the cellar of Castle Daggerdale, abounded in Daggerdale.\n\nIn the middle of the Dagger Hills, about fifteen miles northeast of Castle Daggerdale, lay the ruined tower of [[White Crag]], so ancient it was said to predate even [[elf|elven]] presence in the area. It was rumored that under the tower, vast passages led to the [[Underdark]].\n\nA lone mansion, [[Harrow Hill]], stood on a barren hilltop in the eastern Dagger Hills."
