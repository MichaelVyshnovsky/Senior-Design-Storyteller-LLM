They were believed to have perished with the encroachment of the desert after the fall of Netheril.\nAn ancient battle between the Bedine tribespeople and a group of djinn was the source of the mountains unique name. According to Bedine lore, every member of the tribe died while fighting off the djinn,\n* Sister of Rains, an oasis situated in a valley located at the bottom of the ranges highest peak."
