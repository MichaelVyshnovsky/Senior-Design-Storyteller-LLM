        "mainbody": "he Ikuyu Mountains were a massive mountain range on the isle of Tsukishima in Wa.\nConsidered by many to be the most beautiful natural feature of Wa, the Ikuyus were high, snow-capped mountains that divided the island of Tsukishima in half from north to south. The mountains covered a full 80% of the island, leaving only the western and eastern portions for civilization. Many of the mountains in the range had summits over , and most of them maintained snow and ice cover year round. The range was formed by volcanic activity, and a full 350 of the mountains were volcanoes, many of which were active in .\nTwo groups of mountains spurring off from the central chain of the Ikuyu Mountains were given separate namesâ€”the Jufosu Range and the Origanaya Range. and were home to monstrous rokuro-kubi. The Origanayas were in the north and were home to korobokuru.\nAt the feet of the mountains were verdant, green forests. Many of the extinct volcanoes had peaceful lakes filling their craters.\nThere were a number of passes through the mountains from east to west, but many of them were extremely hazardous to use.\n Mount Matazan  The tallest mountain in Wa,\n Mount Fo  The second-highest mountain in the range, Fo was located north of Tifuido on the west coast.\n Hayatura Road  This was the largest and busiest passage across the mountains and extended from Tifuido in the west to Iiso in the east.\nTwo explorers from Chozawa named Kuyu Guhbio and Funitabi Hichi set out to map the entire mountain range. By Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), they were known to have mapped most of the region south of Chozawa, an impressive feat. It is not known whether they ever finished their epic task.\nThe spirit of Samon, the fabled wandering shukenja, haunted the mountains around the Hayatura Road, for it was here that he was said to have given up his oaths of chastity to marry a peasant maiden who was actually a serpent.\nSome believed that the Ikuyus were the location of the mythical River of Three Routes, where all mortal spirits of Wa traveled when they died. Those who believed this usually guessed that the river was located near Mount Matazan.\nThe Ikuyus were the setting of the famous noh play The Narrow Road to the Sea of Blossoms, which tells the story of a disgraced samurai general who made a death march through the mountains."
