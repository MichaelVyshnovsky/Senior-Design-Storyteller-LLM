'''Mount Sar''' was a mountain peak in the [[Sword Mountains]], the second most southern in the entire range.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}

==Geography==
The mountain located north of [[Waterdeep]] between the [[Long Road]] and the [[High Road]]. Along with [[Mount Helimbrar]] and [[Mount Waterdeep]], it protected the city against the harsh winds from the North.

==Description==
The peak was linked to [[Blackstaff Tower]] by a large-sized two-way keyed [[portal]].

==History==
This mountain was named for a great [[fomorian]] that used to live in it, until they were slain by the early warlords of Waterdeep.{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|11}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, the mountain village of [[Hespheira]] was removed from Mount Sar in [[Faer√ªn]] and somehow transported to the [[Plane of Shadow]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Hespheira]], a minor settlement that experienced great tumult and tragedy.
* [[Melairrin]], an old [[dwarf|dwarven]] citadel located inside the mountain.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}

==Inhabitants==
Mount Sar was inhabited by [[stone giant]]s and [[sylph]]s. A cave in the mountain was also home to the [[frost giant]] [[Harshnag]] the Grim. It was returned to the mountain over a century later, infested by shadow creatures.

[[Gulyaikin Dzrund]], "The Mad Dwarf", lived in a series of caves high up on the mountain. He was known for attacking passersby with rocks either rolled down the mountain or catapulted at ships at sea. Rumors were that he had a vast treasure hidden away.  {{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep}},
