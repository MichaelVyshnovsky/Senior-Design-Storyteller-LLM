        "mainbody": "The '''Firesteap Mountains''' were a mountain range that stretched from the edge of the [[Lake of Steam]] to the forest of [[Chondalwood]], then went on to the northern border of the [[Shaar]] and into the lands beyond.",
        "History": "In the 14th century DR, these mountains were the southern border of the city-state of [[Innarlith]] and contained a citadel under Innarlan control called [[Firesteap Citadel]]. It was from this citadel that Senator [[Pristoleph]] assembled an army that he used to attack the city and overthrow its government to become Ransar in [[1371 DR]]. <ref>",
        "Inhabitants": "The mountains did not have many monsters but, were claimed by the [[Shaaryan]] tribes. They served as home to the ancient tombs of the Shaaryans, who killed or captured anyone that did not have traditional rights. The northern mountains had a couple of bands of [[thieves]], bandits as well as [[ogre]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s that struck at [[caravans]] that passed through."
