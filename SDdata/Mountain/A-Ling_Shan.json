The frozen peaks of this range, most notably the Mahamsaratsu Shan in the east, reached high into the sky. Most reached elevations of between  and .\nSeveral notable glaciers, including the Shigatse Glacier and the Glacier of the Dragon, were found within the A-Ling Shan range. The glaciers crept at almost the very sides of range. Lakes from glacial run-off formed at the base of the mountains as melting snow and ice were trapped by rocky depressions. Flash flooding was a known danger in the region.\nThe mountain range was mostly unexplored and unsettled, and only a single pass, Yarlhang La, opened through it in the north, joining the Old Caravan Road. In the west, there were no known points that afforded a crossing of the Jumpa River Gorge below Yarlhang La, so the only passage into the A-Ling Shan was via the eastern valleys.\nAmong other terrifying monsters, yetis and dragons were known to make their homes on the cold slopes of the A-Ling Shan, and raided the nearby lands for food.\nLocal fauna included cave bears and snow leopards.\nMahamsaratsu Shan was said to be home to a powerful but evil spirit that lured people to their deaths.\nThe fortress monastery of the Tigers Nest stood concealed and inaccessible on the northwestern face of the A-Ling Shan. It was home to the mystical Invisible Tigers monastic order."
