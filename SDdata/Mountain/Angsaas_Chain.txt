The '''Angsaas''', or "'''Eastern Shield'''", was a chain of mountains in the east of the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
The Angsaas Chain overlooked the plains of [[Sossal]] and formed the border between that land and [[Angalpuk]]. It was one of the three ''[[Saas]]'', "Shields", that surrounded and protected the Great Glacier and divided it off from the rest of [[Toril]].

==Flora & Fauna==
White [[caribou]] grazed on the lower slopes of the southern mountains of the chain. As in the other Shields, [[remorhaz]] also were present here in large numbers. [[White dragon]]s also laired in the tallest peaks in the southern parts.
