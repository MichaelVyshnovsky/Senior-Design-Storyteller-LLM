        "mainbody": "The '''Small Teeth''' were a small mountain range that made up the border between [[Amn]] to the north and [[Muranndin]] to the south.",
        "Geography": "The Small Teeth were a relatively small cluster of mountains. The average peak height was 8,000 feet above sea level. They were lightly forested, except for on the tallest peaks.\n\nThe southern foothills were a good area for growing [[grape]]s.\n\nA large amount of snow fell in the mountains.",
        "Inhabitants": "The mountains were home to the [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]]. The lair of a mated pair of [[bronze dragon]]s once resided in the Teeth as well, but they were driven away or slain by Iryklathagra in [[1369 DR]]. The surviving mate, [[Arellaxerrontoal]], plotted her revenge from the [[Forest of Tethir]].\n\nIn [[1095 DR]], the [[Skeletal Finger]] maintained several hideouts in the mountains.\n\nHistorically, the Teeth were home to [[hill giants]]. By [[1370 DR]], in a vast underground network of caves and tunnels within the Small Teeth, the [[Sythillisian Empire]] thrived, ruled by two [[ogre mage|ogre magi]] and their vast army of [[goblinoid]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[kobold]]s, and remaining hill giants.",
        "Trails and Byways": "The Small Teeth had twisting trails that often confused travels. On top of this problem was the danger from the [[humanoid]] monsters in the region.\n\nThe [[Imnescourse Trail]] was one such trail. It led from [[Imnescar]] to [[Gambiton]].",

        },
        "History": "In [[479 DR]], Prince [[Imnel Torlath]] led an army against the ogres of the Small Teeth, clearing the passes. A major battle was fought at a location known as Imnel's Scar, which later became the site of the city of Imnescar.\n\nDuring the [[Shoon Empire]], the city of Xandar served as a second capital for Tethyr, which was a vassal state of the Empire at that time. The entire city was destroyed when a volcano erupted underneath it in [[260 DR]].\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasis]] in [[1370 DR]], the two ogre magi led their army of the \"Sythillisian Empire\" out from the tunnels in the Small Teeth to attack the port city of [[Murann]]."
