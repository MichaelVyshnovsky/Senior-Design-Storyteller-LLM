        "mainbody": "The Galena Mountains, or simply the Galenas, were a massive and forbidding mountain range that formed a natural border around Vaasa in Northeast Faerûn. Some scholars referred to the western arc of the range as an extension of the Earthspurs during the mid-14 century DR and later as the West Galena Mountains, with this second name becoming more common during the 15 century DR.\nThe range was about  long, not more than about  wide, and  tall. It formed a ring around Vaasa from the west to the east in a counterclockwise direction. The range was extremely jagged and permanently topped with ice and snow.\nThe mountains were rich in valuable minerals, and mining operations were among the most productive on Toril. The Galenas were best known for bloodstone, iron and silver. Despite the danger from hostile inhabitants, people came to the mountains in the hope of mining their way to riches, especially the dwarves, who had set up the Bloodstone mines, Hillsafar Hall and Ironspur in the area in order to cultivate the ores. There was an ever-present danger of tunneling into the Underdark beneath the mountains and unleashing the evil creatures within.\nWhile the western Galenas were just as rich as the rest of the mountains to the east, they were largely ignored by outsiders for quite some time.\nThe Galenas created the border that formed a natural border around the lands of Vaasa, separating it from Damara to the east, Thar and the Moonsea lake to the south, and the Ride and the rest of the Moonsea North to the west.\nPasses\nDue to the extremely impassable terrain that constituted the majority of the mountain range, the Bloodstone Pass was the only realistic crossing point for humanoids across the eastern arm for quite some time,\n Peaks\nNotable peaks of the Galena Mountains included Suncatcher Mountain, that marked the point where the range met the Earthspurs, Mount Throndor, and Mount Blaarrbi, a peak that featured a mystic maelstrom in a most unusual location.\nRivers\nThe Galena Snake was a winding river that flowed south from the northeastern edge of the range, before turning southeast and joining the Icelace River. There was a meltwater surge every spring but it was otherwise unnavigable. The Goliad River was located just a ways south, situated near the High Walk path along the eastern slops bordering Damara, and the Beaumaris River was south of that, flowing down either franks of the peaks into both its neighboring realms.\nNestled in the southern arm of the Galenas was the Winterspear River, that wound through the foothills north of Thar before emptying into the Moonsea lake, and the Telstang Brook and Naed Creek, a pair of streams that snaked through the Ride to form Lake Longreach.\nWorgs were known to make their lairs throughout some locations in the Galenas, and perytons lived atop its western peaks.\nAs the Galena Mountains were a source of natural wealth that could bring great riches to people, many people ventured into into its mines every year. It was said that successful miners could mine out millions of gold pieces worth of valuable miners.\nWhen the War of Vaasa broke out in the Cold Lands during the mid–14 century DR, absolutely chaos erupted throughout some areas of the Galena Mountains. During the conflict, the Grandfather of Assassins began for him his army of bandits and instill fear in the people living in the lands to the east. \nIn the , the mountains played host to a council of metallic dragons, called forth by Lareth, Sovereign of the gold dragons. Lareth proposed that they collectively begin to enter slumber, in order to avoid the effects of the Rage of Dragons that was driving their kind to acts of great destruction.\nDuring the late 15 century, the eastern Galenas became a place of conflict once again. The Warlock Knights of Vaasa razed Bloodstone Pass in 1469 DR, which then became the site of a decades-long standoff between the Knights and Damara under King Yarin Frostmantle.\nLandmarks\n*Cave of the Whispering Wind, a haven for travelers and adventurers alike, established within a natural cavern formation.\n*Citadel of Assassins, the mountain fortress that housed the mountains infamous assassins guild.\n*Dragon Necropolis\n*Falls of Ixce\n* Granite Tower, the hidden fortress that was associated with Bodvar the Black.\n*House of Hurl, the refuge of the Thunkers of the Thunkers, formed from a variant of the Doerns Instant Fortress spell.\n*Pillar of Fire, a cavern deep beneath a peak that was linked with the plane of Elemental Chaos.\n*Sanctuary of the Sleeping Wyrms,\n*Seaside Caves, a cave network in the mountains southeastern arm that overlooked the Moonsea lake.\n*Skelem, a ruined city rumored to contain a weapon capable of summoning an army.\nSettlements & Mines\n*Bloodstone Mines, the famous mines dug out by the dwarven Clan Orothiar.\n*Bloodstone Village, the largest of the Galenas mining communities.\n* Delhalls, a frozen-over mine that granted access to rich fields of valuable gems.\n*Hillsafar Hall, a fortress and mine complex named after the dwarves of Clan Hillsafar.\n*Justins Mine, just one more of the Galenas many, many mines.\n*Ironspur, a dwarven city led by High Iron Duke Murnaros.\n* Talagbar, the mine that was twin to Delhalls, although on the opposite side of Vaasa.\n*Wyrmsmoke Keep, an abandoned cloud giant fortress that was taken over by a cell of the Dragon Cult.\nThe mountains were home to many dwarfholds, including duergar, and its peaks were the domain of many goblinoids, orcs, and even giants.\nThe foothills of the West Galena Mountains were known to be the home of several Ibrandlin, large lizard-like creatures that resembled wingless dragons.\nWithin the Underdark beneath the mountains was a city of the drow, called Velddrinnsshar, and a svirfneblin realm known as Deepearth.\n*Celedon Kierney, a rugged former adventurer from Bloodstone that wandered the mountains providing aid to those traveling throughout.\n*Garuk One Ears, a tribe of various goblinoids recognizable by their missing ears.\n*Kastrandrethilian, a young silver dragon.\n*Riordan Parnell, the wandering bard that spent his time seeking out the trills the Galenas had to offer."
