Some scholars referred to the western arc of the range as an extension of the '''Earthspurs''' during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] and later as the '''West Galena Mountains''', with this second name becoming more common during the 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}",
        "Description": {
            "Resources": "The mountains were rich in valuable minerals, and mining operations were among the most productive on [[Toril]]. The Galenas were best known for [[bloodstone]], [[iron]] and [[silver]]. Despite the danger from hostile inhabitants, people came to the mountains in the hope of mining their way to riches, especially the [[dwarves]], who had set up the [[Bloodstone mines]], [[Hillsafar Hall]] and [[Ironspur]] in the area in order to cultivate the ores. There was an ever-present danger of tunneling into the [[Underdark]] beneath the mountains and unleashing the [[evil]] creatures within.\n\nWhile the western Galenas were just as rich as the rest of the mountains to the east, they were largely ignored by outsiders for quite some time."

        "Geography": {
            "Geographic Features": ";Passes\n\nDue to the extremely impassable terrain that constituted the majority of the mountain range, the [[Bloodstone Pass]] was the only realistic crossing point for [[humanoid]]s across the eastern arm for quite some time,{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}\n\n; Peaks\n\nNotable peaks of the Galena Mountains included [[Suncatcher Mountain]], that marked the point where the range met the [[Earthspur Mountains|Earthspurs]], [[Mount Throndor]], and [[Mount Blaarrbi]], a peak that featured a [[mystic maelstrom]] in a most unusual location.\n\n;Rivers\n\nThe [[Galena Snake]] was a winding river that flowed south from the northeastern edge of the range, before turning southeast and joining the [[Icelace River]]. There was a meltwater surge every spring but it was otherwise unnavigable. The [[Goliad River]] was located just a ways south, situated near the [[High Walk]] path along the eastern slops bordering Damara, and the [[Beaumaris River]] was south of that, flowing down either franks of the peaks into both its neighboring realms.\n\nNestled in the southern arm of the Galenas was the [[Winterspear River]], that wound through the foothills north of [[Thar]] before emptying into the Moonsea lake, and the [[Telstang Brook]] and [[Naed Creek]], a pair of streams that snaked through [[the Ride]] to form [[Lake Longreach]].",
            "Flora & Fauna": "[[Worg]]s were known to make their lairs throughout some locations in the Galenas, and [[peryton]]s lived atop its western peaks."
        },
        "Trade": "As the Galena Mountains were a source of natural wealth that could bring great riches to people, many people ventured into into its mines every year. It was said that successful miners could mine out millions of [[gold piece]]s worth of valuable miners.",
        "History": "When the [[War of Vaasa]] broke out in the Cold Lands during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], absolutely chaos erupted throughout some areas of the Galena Mountains. During the conflict, the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] began for him his army of bandits and instill fear in the people living in the lands to the east. \n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, the mountains played host to a council of [[metallic dragon]]s, called forth by [[Lareth]], Sovereign of the [[gold dragon]]s. Lareth proposed that they collectively begin to enter slumber, in order to avoid the effects of the [[Rage of Dragons]] that was driving their kind to acts of great destruction.\n\nDuring the late 15{{th}} century, the eastern Galenas became a place of conflict once again. The [[Warlock Knights]] of Vaasa razed Bloodstone Pass in [[1469 DR]],{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}} which then became the site of a decades-long standoff between the Knights and Damara under King [[Yarin Frostmantle]].",
