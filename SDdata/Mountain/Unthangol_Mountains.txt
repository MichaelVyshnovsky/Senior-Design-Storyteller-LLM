Unther
The Unthangol Mountains were a range of mountains located in  the Old Empires area of Faer√ªn, between southern Unther and the Eastern Shaar.
The Rivers Angol and Alamber originated from the Unthangol Mountains. The Unthangol Mountains formed a portion of Unthers southern border, separating it from the northern reaches of the Shaar. Unthangol Pass, found in the center of the mountain range, allowed for passage through the peaks.
