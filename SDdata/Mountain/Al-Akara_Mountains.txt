'''Al-Akara Mountains''', also called the '''Mountains of Creation''', were a prominent mountain range found in the heart of [[interior Zakhara]].

==Geography==
The mountain range ran for hundreds of miles roughly west to east, abutting the fertile [[Al-Sarif River]] valley near [[Huzuz]] in the west and passing southeast into the [[Cities of the Pantheon]], effectively creating a border from the [[Cities of the Heart]]. A long arm of the mountains sprouted from its center, reaching north into the barren [[Genies' Anvil]] of the [[Haunted Lands]].
