Al-Akara Mountains, also called the Mountains of Creation, were a prominent mountain range found in the heart of interior Zakhara.
The mountain range ran for hundreds of miles roughly west to east, abutting the fertile Al-Sarif River valley near Huzuz in the west and passing southeast into the Cities of the Pantheon, effectively creating a border from the Cities of the Heart. A long arm of the mountains sprouted from its center, reaching north into the barren Genies Anvil of the Haunted Lands.
