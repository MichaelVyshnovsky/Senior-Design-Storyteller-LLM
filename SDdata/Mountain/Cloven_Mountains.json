        "mainbody": "The Cloven Mountains were a wide and barren mountain range rising from the waters of the Deepwash.\nThe range ran from east to west and was split in two by the Wintercloak River, which was how the mountains received their name.\nThe mountains of the western spur were called the High Peaks and filled most of the barony of Ahlarkhem in Erlkazar. The eastern portion of the mountains were located in the Vilhon Reach.\nThe tallest peak in the High Peaks was 10,000 feet above sea level.\nThe Arglander River flowed down from the High Peaks and into the Deepwash.\nThe Cloven Mountains were inhabited by a handful of warring goblinoid and orcish tribes.\nA rumor of a monstrous cat-like beast living in the mountains was told. It was said that the mysterious creature preyed on the goblinoids and anyone foolhardy enough to hunt it."
