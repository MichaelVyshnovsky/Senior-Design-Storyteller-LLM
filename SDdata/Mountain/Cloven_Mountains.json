        "Geography": "The range ran from east to west and was split in two by the [[Wintercloak River]], which was how the mountains received their name.\n\nThe mountains of the western spur were called the [[High Peaks]] and filled most of the barony of [[Ahlarkhem]] in [[Erlkazar]]. The eastern portion of the mountains were located in the [[Vilhon Reach]].\n\nThe tallest peak in the High Peaks was 10,000 feet above sea level.\n\nThe [[Arglander River]] flowed down from the High Peaks and into the Deepwash.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Cloven Mountains were inhabited by a handful of warring [[goblinoid]] and [[orc]]ish tribes.",
        "Rumors": "A rumor of a monstrous [[cat]]-like beast living in the mountains was told. It was said that the mysterious creature preyed on the goblinoids and anyone foolhardy enough to hunt it."
