It lay within the [[Giantspike Mountains]], a part of the [[Earthspur Mountains]], and towered over the [[North Road]] south of [[Maskyr's Eye]]. It marked the proper border of the lands of the Vast and was a prominent local landmark to both the [[human]] and [[dwarf]] inhabitants of the land.{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}",
        "Flora & Fauna": "Once, packs of gray [[wolves]] made their lairs close to the peak, but they competed with local hunters for the highly valued [[stag]]s in the area. The hunters culled many wolves and reduced their numbers significantly.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The sage [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]] estimated that the legendary [[Mount Grimmerfang]] was the first peak north-east of Mount Wolf. However, he'd not investigated this himself to confirm.<ref group=\"note\">The map on page 145 of ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'', shown in the sidebar, shows that Mount Grimmerfang is in fact south-east of Mount Wolf."
