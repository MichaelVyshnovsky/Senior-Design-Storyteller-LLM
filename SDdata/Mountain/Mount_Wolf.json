        "mainbody": "Mount Wolf was a mountain in the Vast in north Faer√ªn. It lay within the Giantspike Mountains, a part of the Earthspur Mountains, and towered over the North Road south of Maskyrs Eye. It marked the proper border of the lands of the Vast and was a prominent local landmark to both the human and dwarf inhabitants of the land.\nOnce, packs of gray wolves made their lairs close to the peak, but they competed with local hunters for the highly valued stags in the area. The hunters culled many wolves and reduced their numbers significantly.\nThe sage Elminster of Shadowdale estimated that the legendary Mount Grimmerfang was the first peak north-east of Mount Wolf. However, hed not investigated this himself to confirm.The map on page 145 of The City of Ravens Bluff, shown in the sidebar, shows that Mount Grimmerfang is in fact south-east of Mount Wolf."
