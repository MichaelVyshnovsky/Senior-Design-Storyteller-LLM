The '''Muaraghal Mountains''' were a range of mountains in the [[Shining South]] that formed the eastern border of [[Halruaa]].

==Geography==
This mountain ranged formed the eastern border of Halruaa, offering natural protection. The [[Azhal Pass]] cut through the mountains, but was not an easy land route for any sizable force.

Many dangerous species were known to inhabit the region closer toward the [[Nath]] along the outside edge of the mountains. These included [[Cyclopskin]], [[Manticore]]s, [[Roc]]s, [[Cockatrice]]s, and [[Medusa|Medusae]].
