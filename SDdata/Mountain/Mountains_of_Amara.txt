The Mountains of Amara were a range in northern Kara-Tur.
The mountain range was found to the east of the larger Koryaz Mountains, bordering the low-lying Ama Basin and the Yellow Sea. To the south lay the Bang Zi Mara Shan mountains closer to Chukei and the island of Talmaruk, and to the west deep within the mountains was the Valley of Nanayok. At the northeast edge of the Mountains of Amara was the fallen Netherese enclave of Urvraunt, a long-lost and never rediscovered ruin.
