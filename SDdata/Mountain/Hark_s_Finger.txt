Harks Finger, or Mount Jiksidur to the Nar, was the most prominent landmark found in the flatlands of central Narfell.
The peak jutted from the surrounding flat landscape, serving as a useful beacon to anyone traveling within eyesight.
The Nar viewed Mount Jiksidur as a sacred place and a gift from the gods.
In truth, Mount Jiksidur was an ancient enclave from Netheril, named Jiksidur, that plummeted from the sky in the Year of Sundered Webs, âˆ’339 DR and crashed on the plains below.
