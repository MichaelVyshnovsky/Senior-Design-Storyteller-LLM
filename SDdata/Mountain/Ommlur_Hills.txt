The Ommlur Hills were the foothills of the Small Teeth located on the west side of the Trade Way.
The hills were noted for their pristine beauty. They included many waterfalls and pleasant flood plains.
These hills were named after a famous Amnian poet who lived during the second century of the Shoon Imperium and wrote about the pastoral beauty of the hills.
