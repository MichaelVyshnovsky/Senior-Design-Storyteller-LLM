The '''Desertsmouth Mountains''', also known as the '''Tethyamar Mountains''', and formerly known as the '''Teshan Mountains''', were a range of mountains that separated the [[Dalelands]] region, to the east, from the great desert of [[Anauroch]], to the west.

==Description==
The mountains were known far and wide as a range of barren peaks that were infested with monstrous creatures.

==Geography==
The mountains marked the western border of [[Daggerdale]] in the Dalelands, and the eastern sands of the Anauroch desert. They were bordered to the south by the [[Stonelands]] of [[Cormyr]], and to the north by the [[Border Forest]].

The sands west of mountains held within them one known ''[[portal]]'', the ''[[Cat's Gate]]'', which let to the plane of [[Cynosure]].

===Flora===
The Desertsmouth Mountains were a home to a species of rare wild white [[Rose]].

===Geographical Features===
The westernmost peak of the mounts was [[Rausrawna]], previously known as Mount Shaddath, and its southernmost peak was referred to as "the Watcher",.

==History==
[[File:D&D.D cinematic Desertsmouth Mountains.png|thumb|''Desertsmouth Mountains around [[1420 DR]].'']]
Large amounts of [[adamantine]] and [[iron]] were found in the {{YearlinkName|-149}} in the Teshan Mountains, as they were then known. The great dwarven realm of [[Tethyamar]] was founded within the mountains a few years later,  in the {{YearlinkName|-145}}.

Both Tethyamar and the The Lost Vale of [[Tarkhaldale]] once stood in the Desertsmouth mountains, until they both fell some 87 years before the signing of the [[Dales Compact]]. They were overwhelmed by the [[orc]] and [[goblinoid]] army that marched from [[Hlundadim]].  

In the {{YearlinkName|1282}}, the returned [[lich]] [[Sammaster]] made his lair within the Desertsmouth peaks, using them as a base of operations to orchestrate the activities of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

In the mid–14{{th}} century, the depths of the mountains became the site of a full-scale war between the native orcs and dwarves of [[Tethyamar]].

==Notable Locations==

* [[Shraevyn's Tomb]], the resting place of the [[Shraevyn|famous mage]] that was located in [[Giant's Craw Valley]].

;Settlements:
