        "mainbody": "alagars Dagger was the highest peak in the northeast section of the Nether Mountains.\nThe Dagger was named after Dalagar, a dwarf who tried to climb the mountain some time before the late 4 century DR and fell to his death.\nOver the years, many dying blue, green, and black dragons committed suicide by impaling themselves on the knifelike pinnacle. Their bones were scattered all around the peak and among them there were gems and jewelry that covered their scales with in life. This treasure remained mostly untouched since the Moruemes (who have never dared to touch a single coin) tenaciously defended the place against any approaching creatures. The dragons of the Morueme clan seemed to be aware when someone was trying to reach the hoard. On two different occasions they ripped two young dragons to pieces who came there to plunder the riches. It was discovered later that one of these two young dragons was a mage under the effects of transformation spell. Members of the Morueme clan would later find out the mages residence and publicly return his remains there as warning to other equally ambitious wizards."
