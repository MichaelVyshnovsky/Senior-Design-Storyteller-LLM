        "History": "The Dagger was named after [[Dalagar]], a [[dwarf]] who tried to climb the mountain some time before the late 4{{th}} century [[DR]] and fell to his death.",
        "Significance": "Over the years, many dying [[blue dragon|blue]], [[green dragon|green]], and [[black dragon|black]] [[dragon]]s committed suicide by impaling themselves on the [[dagger|knifelike]] pinnacle. Their bones were scattered all around the peak and among them there were [[gem]]s and jewelry that covered their scales with in life. This treasure remained mostly untouched since the [[Morueme]]s (who have never dared to touch a single coin) tenaciously defended the place against any approaching creatures. The dragons of the Morueme clan seemed to be aware when someone was trying to reach the hoard. On two different occasions they ripped two young [[dragon]]s to pieces who came there to plunder the riches. It was discovered later that one of these two young dragons was a [[mage]] under the effects of transformation spell. Members of the Morueme clan would later find out the mage's residence and publicly return his remains there as warning to other equally ambitious wizards."
