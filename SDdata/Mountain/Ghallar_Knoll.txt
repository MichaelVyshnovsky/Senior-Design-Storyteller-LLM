'''Ghallar Knoll''' was a small hill said to contain red-colored grass with magical properties.

==Description==
Ghallar Knoll supposedly was found in the western [[Small Teeth]] mountains. It was said to be a short, perfectly rounded hill. The hill was covered with brilliant red blades of grass.

==Inhabitants==
A mysterious creature known only as "the [[Ghallar]]" protected the Knoll from intrusion, but few had ever actually seen the being to be able to describe it.

==Rumors==
Local legends stated that if one were to eat two blades of the scarlet-colored grass, he or she would be cured of all poisons and would grow ten years younger.
