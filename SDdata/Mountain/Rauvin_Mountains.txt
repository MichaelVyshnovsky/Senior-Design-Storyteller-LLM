The '''Rauvin Mountains''' were a small mountain range located in the [[Silver Marches]] of [[Northwest Faerûn]].

==Geography==
{{Climate/Silver Marches/North and alpine|the Rauvin Mountains}}
The Rauvins were located south of the [[Cold Wood]] and north of the larger [[Nether Mountains]] range.The Rauvins formed the southern border of [[Cold Vale]] and [[Adbar Run]] and the northern border of the [[Sundabar Vale]]. The [[River Rauvin]] was widely believed to begin at [[Rainbow Gorge]] in the Rauvin Mountains (although in truth it began far to the north in the [[Cold Wood]] and traveled underground in the [[Rauvinheart caverns]] before appearing aboveground at Rainbow Gorge).

==Description==
The Rauvins spanned a range of {{SI|130|miles}} east-to-west and {{SI|30|miles}} north-to south. The mountains themselves were purple-hued and rose between {{SI|7000|ft}} and {{SI|8000|ft}} above the valley floor.

==Inhabitants==
The northern side of the Rauvins were inhabited primarily by three orc tribes: the [[Heart Takers]], [[Red Fangs]], and [[Tornskulls]], named after various rituals to [[Gruumsh]]. [[Bugbear]]s, [[ogre]]s, and several varieties of [[giant]]s ([[hill giant|hill]], [[cloud giant|cloud]], [[frost giant|frost]]) also dwelt in the mountains.

A number of [[dragon]]s roamed the Rauvins and the neighboring Nether Mountains, namely [[fang dragon]]s and [[white dragon]]s (the most likely to be seen), [[blue dragon|blues]], [[copper dragon|coppers]],  [[Gold dragon|golds]], [[Red dragon|reds]], [[Silver dragon|silvers]], and the occasional [[dracolich]].

==Wildlife==
The mountains were home to bears, wolves, [[Rothe|ghost rothe]], and giant eagles. Other inhabitants included [[dire boar]]s, [[dire bear]]s, [[dire wolf|dire wolves]], [[ettin]]s, [[worg]]s, and [[wyvern]]s.
