After Karsuss Folly in -399 DR, the leaders of the realm of Illefarn asked the dragon Nolalothcaragascint for aid in defeating the King of Shadows, but the dragon was defeated. The force of his body striking the ground created a massive valley within the Sword Mountains. The leaders of Illefarn transformed the dragons heart into a crystalline floating structure reminiscent of a Phylactery, where the dragons soul remained for centuries within the fertile valley. 
The mountains were home to orcs and trolls, but after the orcs were united by Wund and the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge in the , the orcs drove the trolls out. This was a contributing factor to the Trollwars.

Due to a raid on Ukrypts crypt by a human adventuring company called the Dawnbringer Company in the , the orcs of the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge formed a horde called the Broken Bone with the intent of destroying Waterdeep. Their plans were once again ruined by a dragon this time Lhammaruntosz.
