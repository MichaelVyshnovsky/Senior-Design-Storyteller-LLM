The Tching Mountains were a small mountain range found on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
The Tching Mountains rose from the plains along the coast of the Shining Sea in northwest Thindol between the Hazur Mountains in the east and the Sanrach Mountains in the west.
The presence of a lone hungry chaos roc lairing atop its peaks kept the mountains devoid of most life. The chaos roc was even known to attack ships sailing too close to the coast.
