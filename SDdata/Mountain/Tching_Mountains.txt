The '''Tching Mountains''' were a small mountain range found on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The Tching Mountains rose from the plains along the coast of the [[Shining Sea]] in northwest [[Thindol]] between the [[Hazur Mountains]] in the east and the [[Sanrach Mountains]] in the west.

==Inhabitants==
The presence of a lone hungry [[chaos roc]] lairing atop its peaks kept the mountains devoid of most life. The chaos roc was even known to attack ships sailing too close to the coast.
