        "mainbody": "'''Stoner's Needle''', also called '''Needle Rock''', was a rocky spire in the [[Sword Coast]] lands.<ref group=\"note\">The exact location of Stoner's Needle is unknown from ''[[The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka]]'', but the sequence of events suggests it is not far outside [[Waterdeep]]. The nearby [[Sword Mountains]] are a possibility. However, the artwork and conversation depict barren, rocky hills, while the [[bounty seekers]] cross a stream or river, which may be the [[River Dessarin]]. These suggest Stoner's Needle to be located in one of the ranges of hills lying east of Waterdeep, such as the [[Forlorn Hills]]/[[Fallen Hills]] (apparently bleak and once a [[dwarf]] realm) or the [[Larch Hills]].",
        "History": "The extraplanar monster [[Imgig Zu]] placed a [[Lockstone]] with a frozen [[Basilisk|greater basilisk]] as guardian on the summit of Stoner's Needle. This Lockstone would restore [[Jogaoh]], who had escaped Imgig Zu's captivity, to his original form, but Jogaoh feared the basilisk too much to make the climb up and take the Lockstone. Instead, Jogaoh made his home close to the spire, and made a name for himself as a smith who could work [[magic]]. <ref group=\"note\">The conditions of the Lockstone imply this took place at least two centuries prior to 1357 DR, so some time before [[1157 DR]].\n\nIn the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Cybriana]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Priam Agrivar]] sought out the famed [[dwarf]] smith Jogaoh for his services. Jogaoh agreed to help, provided the companions retrieved the Lockstone from atop Stoner's Needle. Jogaoh accompanied the heroes to the stony spire. They camped for the night at the base of the Needle, but close to dawn they were attack by [[ghoul]] warriors that clawed their way out of the earth.\n\nAfter defeating the [[undead]], Vajra, Priam, and Jogaoh ascended the rocky tower, with Vajra carrying Jogaoh on her back and pulling up the weakened Priam. Reaching the summit, Jogaoh revealed his story and took the Lockstone. The magical gem restored the dwarf to his true form as a [[fire elemental]]. Jogaoh returned to his own plane, leaving Vajra and Priam to face the now-awakened basilisk. Vajra slew the basilisk, using the reflection of the gem so it would turn itself to stone, saving Priam.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka|11-14, 16-22}}"
