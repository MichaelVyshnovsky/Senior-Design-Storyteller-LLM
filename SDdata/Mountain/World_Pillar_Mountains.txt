The '''World Pillar Mountains''', called '''Jibal al-Akbas''' in [[Midani language|Midani]], were the southernmost range of the mighty [[Yehimal]] and the greatest mountain range in [[Zakhara]].<ref><ref> The World Pillars contained the center of power and the majority of the [[Land of the Yak-Men]].

==Geography==
The mountains formed the greatest barrier to entering Zakhara from [[Faer√ªn]] or [[Kara-Tur]] by land.

From their narrow northerly connection to the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]] of Kara-Tur (linked via the [[Web Mountains]]), they stretched mainly in a southern direction. To the west, they dropped toward the rugged lands outside the city of [[Utaqa]] and the [[Great Sea]], to the east the [[Jungle of Monsters]] reached onto their foothills. Towards the southwest, the greatest [[kavir]] (salt flat) of Zakhara separated the mountains from the rest of the [[Haunted Lands]] desert.

==Inhabitants==
While the [[evil]] [[yak-men]] were the undisputed masters of the Jibal al-Akbas, they remained a minority. Many [[human]]s, [[yeti]], [[Dwarf|dwarves]], and [[dao]] were kept as slaves, while [[marrashi|marrash]] were the yikaria's only open allies.

==Fauna==
In the mostly barren World Pillars, moderate numbers of [[mountain goat]]s, [[musk oxen]], and [[yak]]s could be found, hunted by [[snow leopard]]s.

==Climate==
The harsh climate of these tall mountains was somewhat tempered by the warm and moist winds coming from the Great Sea, which also led to heavy rainfalls on their northwestern edge. The bearable temperatures of Jibal al-Akbas' [[Gate of Heaven|very center]] have been attributed to the direct influence of the yak-men's [[The Faceless God|Faceless God]].

==History==
The World Pillar Mountains were once controlled by dwarves, until the yak-men formed their [[Yikarian Empire|empire]] in the middle of the [[467 DR|5th century]] [[DR]].
