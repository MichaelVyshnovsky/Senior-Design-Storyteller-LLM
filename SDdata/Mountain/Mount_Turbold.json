The mountain and the valley were named after the leader of the dwarves, Turbold.\nTurbolds burial site was supposedly located in a crypt hidden somewhere in the mountain, containing his treasures and those of the dwarves he led who were also buried there. Turbolds Golden Axe was the most famous artifact said to be resting there.\nCategoryMountains\nCategoryLocations in the Kuldin Peaks\nCategoryLocations in Carrelath\nCategoryLocations in Erlkazar\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Iltkazar Range\nlgkdipq39caymr4yvs9wtq9de1m5n08"
