Travelers could safely pass over and through its peaks as they journeyed from town to town.\n\nAt some point in their history, however, an enigmatic malicious force appeared within the Lost Hills. This force brought with it terrible creatures that plagued anyone that dared pass through.\n\nThe hills were then afflicted by a magical enchantment that rendered navigation within nearly impossible. In the years that followed, only the foolhardy or valiant dared navigate the Lost Hills' paths.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, caravans that passed through [[Crossergate]] began mysteriously disappearing in the Lost Hills. The Lord Protector of Crossergate made a plea to Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] of Neverwinter, fearing for some unknown danger looming just outside the town walls. \n\nIn turn, Lord Nasher tasked hired adventurers to begin an investigation. They discovered that whatever strange evil took residence in the Hills turned the road into a twisting and turning disorienting maze as if it was altered by [[magic]].",
