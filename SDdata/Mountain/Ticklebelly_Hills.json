        "mainbody": "The Ticklebelly Hills was a grouping of rocky hills and cliffs found in the Moonsea North region of North Faer√ªn.\nThe Ticklebelly Hills comprised rocky mounds, large crags and sparse vegetation. The landscape was relatively difficult to traverse, at least for humanoid travelers.\nThe hills were situated along the southern slopes of the eastern Dragonspine Mountains, north of the Grass Sea and the Giants Cairn.\nBulettes were known to dig their tunnels beneath the earth of the Ticklebelly Hills.\nIn the , a shooting star fell from the skies into the hills, causing unease among the local wildlife and forming a massive crater.\n* Kranuns Crater, home to the exiled stone giant Kranun and the pool of radiance that formed within.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, orcs of the Burning Banner tribe were observed to be active throughout the hills.\nStone giants and their saber-toothed tiger pets were known to wander the hills and the surrounding lands.\n* Coldborn, a dragonborn druid associated with the Emerald Enclave."
