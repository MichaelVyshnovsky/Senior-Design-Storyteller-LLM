'''Mount Hotenow''' ({{Pronounce|HOE|teh|NOW|refs=<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2017-01-23 - Mount Hotenow's Pronunciation}}}}) known to the ancient [[dwarves]] as '''Glaurimm''', was a volcano amid the [[Crags]] mountain range, situated to the northeast of the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]], deep in [[Neverwinter Wood]]. It was home to a large population of [[fire elemental]]s, warming the [[Neverwinter River]] to the point where it never froze over, even in the heart of winter, giving the city its name.

A shadowy reflection of [[Mount Hotenow (Shadowfell)|Mount Hotenow]] also existed in the [[Shadowfell]]. Unlike its [[Toril]]ian counterpart, the Mount Hotenow of the Shadowfell was always spilling rivers of lava, which flowed to the city of [[Evernight]].

==Description==
Prior to its eruption, Mount Hotenow was described as a twin-peaked mountain, with the taller peak standing south-southeast of the shorter one. Both were barren of trees following some great fire in the past that had allowed the top soil to erode away.

After its eruption, the lower peak was gone and the rock of the mountain was shattered. Mount Hotenow looked like a set of serrated teeth that many described as a "door to the [[Nine Hells]]" (or the [[Elemental Chaos]], according to others). A river made of pure elemental [[fire]] followed a serpentine path throughout Hotenow's interior and underneath the surrounding mountains and hills of the Crags.

==Geography==
[[File:Mount_Hotenow_landscape.png|thumb|right|250px|''The devastated landscape around Mount Hotenow.'']]
Within Mount Hotenow were largely untapped deposits of [[alum]], [[nitre]], and [[sal ammoniac]].

===Flora & Fauna===
The volcano also had a tendency to attract creatures like [[fire giant]]s and [[red dragon]]s to make their homes near it.

Following the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], creatures that could be found within Mount Hotenow included [[bloodfire ooze]]s, [[fire archon]]s, [[fire bat]]s, [[fire beetle]]s, [[galeb duhr]]s, [[flamespider]]s, while on its slopes could be found [[elemental weevil]]s.

==History==
[[File:Mount Hotenow.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Mount Hotenow erupts!'']]
Since Neverwinterâ€˜s founding, Mount Hotenow had long been a majestic landmark that featured in the bedtime stories and urban legends of the city's inhabitants as the home of [[fire giant]]s, the fearsome [[red dragon]] [[Karrundax]], and many other blazing beasts.

In the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, a small adventuring party rediscovered the ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] city of [[Gauntlgrym]] beneath the volcano. The party, consisting of [[Dahlia Sin'felle]], [[Korvin Dor'crae]], [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], [[Athrogate]], and [[Jarlaxle Baenre]], made it all the way to the legendary forges. There, the latter two were betrayed by their [[Thay]]an allies, with Athrogate hypnotically forced to activate the forge. This briefly awoke the [[primordial]] [[Maegera]], who, in a fit of rage, released a burst of energy so powerful that it forced [[Ruining|the eruption of the volcano]]. The resulting earthquake and combination of smoke and lava destroyed much of Neverwinter, killing thousands. The eruption entirely destroyed the settlement of [[Thundertree]].

Over the next few decades the [[Cult of Maegera]] led by the mad fire giant [[Gommoth]] emerged within Mount Hotenow, attracting many of its fire-worshiping denizens. Having felt a shared "rapturous awakening" during the volcano's eruption they sought to re-awaken Maegera from her slumber once again.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a dwarven expedition led by [[Vandra Hillborn]] ventured into Mount Hotenow in hopes of finding an entrance to Gauntlgrym.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Mount Hotenow nearly erupted again due to the activities of [[Orn]], a fire giant who tried to create a dragon-slaying weapon using its magma river. Due to the actions of a band of adventurers, the eruption did not occur. Mount Hotenow had a minor eruption again in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} when [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] happened to ride past on their way south to Neverwinter.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Throughout recorded history, there had been many legends surrounding Mount Hotenow. Some believed that it sat atop a passage to the [[Nine Hells]] or a gateway to the [[Elemental Chaos]]. Others claimed that it had a secret entrance to Gauntlgrym. Following the Spellplague, in Neverwinter and [[Helm's Hold]], there was an oft-told tale that suggested anyone who dared to enter its caves was to become cursed to die in a fire within one year.
