        "mainbody": "'''Mount Aergurl''', known earlier as '''The Sleeper In The Sunrise''', was a mountain in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]]. It lay within the [[Giantspike Mountains]], a part of the [[Earthspur Mountains]], and was due east of the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}",
        "Geography": "Described as a long rising peak, down Aergurl's slope ran a creek that had carved a high cleft. Though hazardous, this cleft formed a pass through the mountains, leading to high chilly valleys and ultimately the [[Glacier of the White Worm]].",
        "Reputation": "The pass was little known to [[human]]s in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The folk of Maskyr's Eye were aware of it, but did not talk about it to outsiders, but their hunters warned of an unnatural cold beyond the Sleeper.\n\nThe local [[dwarves]] had a legend of how the dwarf hero [[Aurgus]] killed a [[remorhaz]] single-handedly in the mountain pass.",
        "History": "Once, [[orc]]s marched through the pass to attack the dwarves who made their delves in the mountains near [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]].This is undated, but may be part of the orc attack on [[Roldilar]] in [[649 DR]].\n\nHowever, no army had come through it within the lifetime of humans by the late 1350s DR."
