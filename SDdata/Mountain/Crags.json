        "mainbody": "The '''Crags''', also referred to as the '''Crag Mountains''', were a series of hills, broken mounds, and mountains found on the [[Sword Coast North]] region of [[the North]].",
        "Description": "The stretch of hills and mounds known as the Crags resembled a stitched wound of [[Toril]]'s flesh. These flattened steppes and mounds transformed into a true mountain range as the elevations extended outward beyond its origin point.\n\nIn the past, many mines were located within the crags,",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The landscape of the Crags was desolate and its terrain was quite harsh. There were however several pools of meltwater found among its upper reaches. Long-abandoned pit traps still remained in the clefts between the peaks of the Crags.\n\nThe Crags' most notable geographical landmark appeared after the hills of the Crags gradually grew to form true mountains.\n\nA network of caverns could be found within the depths of the Crags. One of these caverns housed a two-way ''[[portal]]'' connecting to the [[Kyorlamshin]] temple of [[Lolth]] within the [[Underdark]]."
        },
        "History": "During the era of the [[First Flowering]], the Crags marked the western boundary of the magnificent dwarven kingdom of [[Delzoun]].\n\nConstruction of the underground city of [[Gauntlgrym]] began in {{YearlinkName|-335}}, an undertaking initiated by [[Immar Fardelver]] commissioned by the [[arcanist]] [[Maerin]] of [[Illusk]].\n\nAs of the early 9{{th}} century DR, the Crags marked the eastern border of [[Stornanter]], the Realm of the [[Laeral Silverhand|Witch-Queen of the North]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, the [[Knights of the Sword Coast]] became stuck in a mountain pass in the Crags when they were ambushed by [[hill giant]]s. Fortunately the adventurer [[Arkiem Arren]] happened to be wandering nearby and came to their aid.\n\nNearly a century later, in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, the discovery of the lost city of Gauntlgrym and the activation of the legendary forges within awakened the [[primordial]] [[Maegera]] within her prison beneath [[Mount Hotenow]]. In a fit of rage and fury, the once-slumbering primordial released a burst of energy that caused a massive volcanic eruption and subsequent earthquake. Nearby cities such as Neverwinter were left in a near-ruined state and hundreds of innocents died in the destruction.",
