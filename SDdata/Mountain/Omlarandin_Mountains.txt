The '''Omlarandin Mountains''' were a mountain range in [[Tethyr]] and [[Erlkazar]], known for its richness in [[omlar gem]]s, which had a variety of magical uses.

==Etymology==
The name "omlarandin" is a corruption of [[Dwarvish]] ''olaramorndin'', which means "magical peaks".

==Geography==
The Omlarandin Mountains were a cluster of lightly forested mountains located in the highlands in the east of Tethyr. They were the smallest grouping of mountains that were part of the greater [[Iltkazar Range]] and&mdash;with only a few exceptions&mdash;were little higher than the foothills around them.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|53}}

The Omlarandins were most famous for being the only known source of omlar gems in [[Faerûn]], though only a few were ever discovered in a given century.

One notable rock formation in the mountains was called [[Orators' Crag]], due to its strange acoustics. Anyone whispering from the small outcropping in the cliff could be heard within the tiny valley below. The crag overlooked the upper waters of the [[Idolflow]] river.

The [[Levast River]] also had its headwaters in the northern reaches of the mountains.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|54}}

==Inhabitants==
The Omlarandins were the most populated mountains in Tethyr after the fall of [[Iltkazar]].{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|55}}

[[Bleucorundum]], the "Sapphire Sentinel", a very old male [[sapphire dragon]], guarded over the [[Sleeping Legion]] of the [[Knights of the Crescent Moon]], in a secret location in the heart of the mountains.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|69}}

==Monsters==
As late as [[1372 DR]], the mountains were inhabited by [[wyvern]]s and [[displacer beast]]s. The latter were dubbed "Omlarcats", and in [[1370 DR]] it was said that there were more displacer beasts in the Omlarandins than anywhere else in Faerûn. Though they caused problems with the shepherds of [[Saradush]] by stealing from their herds, the Omlarcats were only dangerous during their mating season, which fell in autumn each year, and the following spring when their young were born.

==Trails & Byways==
The trail from Saradush to [[Tibold]] passed through the mountains and was known as [[Borthun's Walk]], after the famous [[Dwarf|dwarven]] explorer [[Borthun the Walker]]. The trail was generally considered safe; however, in the 1370s, wyverns nesting north of the trail began causing problems.

By [[1370 DR]], the [[Twisted Rune]] had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Chapel of the Blooded Moon]] : This buried ancient chapel was where the Sleeping Legion of the Knights of the Crescent Moon waited to be called upon to defend Tethyr against [[beholder]]s again.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|56}}
; [[Earthsky Pass]] : This was a steeply sloped valley in the center of the mountains.

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-2400}}, the armies of the [[Tavihr Dynasty]] of [[Calimshan]] established garrisons in the region of these mountains south of the [[River Ith]].
