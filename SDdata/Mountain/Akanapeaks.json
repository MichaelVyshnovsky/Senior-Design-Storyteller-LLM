        "mainbody": "The '''Akanapeaks''' were a mountain range in [[Chessenta]], forming its historical western border. The south-western part of the Akanapeaks was claimed by the [[Blade Kingdoms]].",
        "Description": "The range ran south by the western side of the [[Akanamere]].\n\nThe south-western part of the Akanapeaks housed the city-states of [[Kirenzia]], [[Sumbria]], and [[Zutria]] that were nestled between the Akanamere and the Akanapeaks. The city-state of [[Colletro]] stood within the south-western part of the Akanapeaks, in the rich [[Valley of Umbricci]], with a single mountain pass that led to the [[Trevi River]] and joined the rest of the Blade Kingdoms on the lake's shores.",
        "Trade": "[[Iron]] was mined in the safer parts of the Akanapeaks, and this supplied the nearby city of Reth and other parts of Chessenta in mid–14{{th}} century DR.\n\nAnother notable trade good from Akanapeaks was [[delph]], a spice with an extremely long shelf-life. The spice was created from a species of yellow wildflowers, foun in Chessenta, [[Mulhorand]], [[Threskel]], [[Unther]], as well as the Akanapeaks.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-04-13 - Arispeg, Delph, and Marka}}",
        "History": "[[File:Blade Kingdoms.jpg|thumb|''The [[Blade Kingdoms]] part of the Akanapeaks citca [[1217 DR]].''|320x320px]]\nThe year of [[–9845 DR]] saw the erection of the [[Sharksbane Wall]] that stretched between the northernmost edge of Akanapeaks in Chessenta to the southwesternmost [[Altumbel]]. The wall was constructed as protection against [[sahuagin]] incursions by the clergies of [[Deep Sashelas]], [[Trishina]], and [[Eadro]].\n\nIn the [[Rotting War]], in the {{YearlinkName|902}}, the army of [[Reth]] crept through the foothills of the Akanapeaks behind the [[Nunwood]] to attack the armies of [[Arrabar]] and [[Hlath]]. The impatience of the rules of the cities entangled in the conflict led to the use of deadly [[Netherese]] magics. A wave of [[necromantic]] energy swepts throught the armies causing a gread plague that spread like wildfire across the region, carried by the war's survivors.\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|1017}}, several mercenary companies, under the moniker of the [[Grand Company of Sumbria]], elected to leave [[Chondath]] in a mass-exodus. The mercenaries, along with their families, machinery, and other resources claimed lands on the north-western shores of the [[Akanamere]] and the south-western part of the Akanapeaks. Soon, the tent camps turned into six city-states, forming the [[Blade Kingdoms]].{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}}\n\nThe orcish tribes of the Akanapeaks had had long history of fighting and trading with the humans of Chessenta. They had launched a number of uprisings against them. To guard against incursions by the Akanapeaks orc tribes, the fort of [[Rodanar]] was established by the warlord [[Tchazzar]] of the [[Chessentan Empire]] ([[929 DR|929]]–[[1018 DR]]).\n\nIn the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, a \"white war\", a bloodless competitions of strategic wit, raged between armies of Colletro and neighboring Sumbria. The Valley of Umbricci was the contested territory. Its [[salt]] mines, olive presses, and rich cattle farms were a desirable prize. The conflict between the Prince of Sumbria - [[Cappa Mannicci da Sumbria]], and the ruler of Colletro - Prince-elect [[Ricardo]], was resolved with the triumph of Sumbria.\n\nWhen a bloody civil war erupted between the orc tribes of the Akanapeaks, many refugees of the Flaming Spike tribe went to Airspur. They went into business as traders, intermarried with [[human]]s, and soon gave rise to a burgeoning population of [[half-orc]]s.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], a portion of the world of [[Abeir]] was swapped with western Chessenta in [[1386 DR]], causing utter catastrophe. The city of Airspur was destroyed when a vast crevasse opened beneath it. Many were killed and the survivors fled into the Akanapeaks, back to orcish kin and the safety of the mountains.{{Cite dragon/377/Explore Airspur|62}}{{Cite dragon/377/Explore Airspur|68}}",
        "Notable Locations": "*The [[Gap of Reth]], a mountain pass that was blocked by a wall to guard the nearby city of Reth from invasion. A gate ran through it to admit traffic, but the pass and gate separated Reth from the rest of Chessenta.\n*[[Deepspur]], a prosperous [[genasi]] city, part of Akanûl, was constructed inside the sheer cliffs of a chasm in the Akanapeaks by [[1479 DR]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Once, the range was home to dwarves, who dug mines into the mountains over 1600 years before [[Dale Reckoning]]. These are later abandoned.\n\nBy the mid–14{{th}} century DR, the large [[Flaming Spike]] orc tribe, espimated at 50,000, lived on the western slopes of the Akanapeaks and in the old dwarven mines.\n\nMany predators of the [[Nunwood]] on the western side in Chondath were once driven eastward into the Akanapeaks before [[1370 DR]].\n\nA mysterious [[dragon]] of incredible size made its lair somewhere in the Akanapeaks in the late 15{{th}} century. Of unknown name and species, but theorized to be a [[gray dragon]], observations of it were unreliable but it was known to ferociously attack ambassadors of [[Akanûl]] and the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] alike."
