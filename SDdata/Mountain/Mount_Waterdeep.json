        "mainbody": "Mount Waterdeep was the name of the mountain on and around which the city of Waterdeep was built. It was a rough, rocky mountain and stood some  above the sea level, to the west of the city. Beneath the mountain was the notorious Undermountain. The whole of Mount Waterdeep was considered to be in the Castle Ward.\nMount Waterdeep shielded the city from the worst coastal storm winds. Inside the heart of the mountain there was a freshwater spring, that once spewed out and down its seaward rocks and into the sea below. Later on this spring was redirected into large-cistern caverns that were built into the upper reaches of the mountain, which then went down pipes into the citys sewer system.\nThere was a ballad that spoke an ancient city sunk into the sea and the gods raised a head stone for it to mark the grave. That was Mount Waterdeep.\nMount Waterdeep was once home to the underhalls of Melairbode, a shield dwarf hold.\n* Waterdeeps Peaktop Aerie, which housed the Griffon Cavalry riders, sat on this mountain top.\n* A lookout tower.\n* A Celestial Stairway\n* On its seaward side rested eleven gigantic triple catapults.\n* Several sea caves existed on the western side of the mountain. These were all watched by the City Guard.\n* The south seacave was connected to Undermountain by a set of hoists large enough to move a sailing ship.\n* The Cliffride, a steep gravel path that ran along the western edge of Mount Waterdeeps northern spur, connecting the festhall Silavenes, the rental villa of Fair Winds, and, at its southern end, the bardic college of New Olamn.\nThe reclusive monk Hlam lived in a cave halfway up the side of the mountain."
