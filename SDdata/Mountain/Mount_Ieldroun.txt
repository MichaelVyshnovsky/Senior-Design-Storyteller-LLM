Mount Ieldroun was one of the two tallest mountains east from the Moon Pass.
The mountain peak was named for a long dead orc chieftain. 
Ieldroun stood halfway between Stone Stand and the site of Hellgate Keep. 
Between Mount Ieldroun and Mount Thorog was Telkouns Tower, a stronghold of a little-known wizard and protected by perytons.
