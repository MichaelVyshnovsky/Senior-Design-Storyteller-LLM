The Frost Hills were a barren region in the southern reaches of the Spine of the World.
Located in the southernmost tip of the Spine of the World, the Frost Hills were bordered by the Evermoors to the south and the Silver Marches to the east.
The Frost Hills was the place that hosted Mithral Hall, one of the most powerful dwarven stronghold of the North. There also dwelt several Uthgardt tribes, orcs, frost giants, white dragons and the lich-lord who lay buried between its labyrinthine ruins under the ice in slow decomposition.
