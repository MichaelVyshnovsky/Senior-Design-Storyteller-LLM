The '''Frost Hills''' were a barren region in the southern reaches of the [[Spine of the World]].

==Geography==
Located in the southernmost tip of the Spine of the World, the Frost Hills were bordered by the [[Evermoors]] to the south and the [[Silver Marches]] to the east.

==Description==
The Frost Hills was the place that hosted [[Mithral Hall]], one of the most powerful dwarven stronghold of the North. There also dwelt several [[Uthgardt]] tribes, [[orc]]s, [[frost giant]]s, [[white dragon]]s and the [[lich]]-lord who lay buried between its labyrinthine ruins under the ice in slow decomposition.
