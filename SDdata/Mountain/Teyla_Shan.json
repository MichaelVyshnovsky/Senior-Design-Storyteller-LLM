        "mainbody": "Teyla Shan, or the Godswatch Mountains, formed much of the border of eastern Semphar, essentially separating the country from the vast plains of the Hordelands.\nTeyla Shan ran roughly north to south from the River Estan in the north to the pass of Howling Gap in the south.\nOne of the mountain ranges most prominent peaks, Shan Karsha, was found in the southeast region overlooking the Silk Road.\nWhen the manifestations of the gods of the Mulhorandi and the Untheric pantheons came to Toril, they landed in the highest peaks of the Teyla Shan. There, they further divided their power to create the incarnations that fought against the Imaskari."
