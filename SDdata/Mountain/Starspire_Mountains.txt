The '''Starspire Mountains''' were a range of low mountains in [[Tethyr]].

==Geography==
The Starspires began gradually in the highlands of eastern Tethyr and ran from east to west.

The average height of the mountains in this range were only {{SI|4500|ft}} above sea level. Four of the peaks were above {{SI|5000|ft}}. The summit of the tallest was at {{SI|7200|ft}}, making this range among the smallest of the [[Lands of Intrigue]].

[[Hawkwing's Brook]], a major tributary to the [[Sulduskoon River]], flowed down from the eastern slopes.

==Climate==
The Starspires were very humid; they received a large amount of rain during the summer months and snow during the winter months. The snow could remain on the taller peaks even into the summer.

The peaks were nearly tree-covered, growing more dense in greenery as the slopes met the [[Forest of Tethir]] to the north or the waters of the [[Sulduskoon River]] to the south.

==Fauna==
Sheeps and goats belonging to local farmers of counties [[Starspur]] and [[Uluran]] dotted the foothills of the Starspires. For predators, [[displacer beast]]s and [[peryton]]s hunted in the region.

==Trails and Byways==
Despite the lower altitude, the mountains contained many treacherous passes. The [[Trade Way]] passed through the mountains, but beyond that, there were few navigable trails.

Deep below the mountains, a network of [[Dwarf|dwarven]] highways connected to the [[Nemessor Tunnel]], extended under the mountains.

==Inhabitants==
A tribe of [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Clan Ghalmrin]], lived under the eastern peaks of the Starspires and traded with the city of [[Zazesspur]] in the west.

In addition to the dwarves, other races made their homes in the mountains and hills, including [[svirfneblin]], [[ogre]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and [[Werewolf|werewolves]].

[[Orc]]s used to live in the Starspires, but by the 1300s DR, they were extinct from the region.

The great [[red dragon]] [[Balagos]] kept a lair in the Starspires, and other [[dragon]]s lived there as well, in the western mountains.

==History==
In the declining years of the dwarven Kingdom of [[Shanatar]], a feud with the [[Elf|elves]] of the Forest of Tethir led to the extinction of [[Clan Gemcrypt]], which used to reside in the western Starspires.

The first vizera of the [[Ithal Dynasty]] of Tethyr, [[Zahyra Ithal]], was buried in the mountains. Sometime around [[1370 DR]], her tomb was discovered and her journals found. King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Haedrak]] used her journals as sources for his historical opus ''[[Historia Tethyra]]''.

In [[1188 DR]], the vizera of King [[Alemander II]] was discovered consorting with a [[lich]] in a cavern in the Starspire Mountains. She was executed for her crimes.

The orcs of the region were eliminated by [[1242 DR]], hunted to extinction by one general [[Haraqimn]], who sought revenge on the murder of his fiance√© on his wedding day by a tribe of orcs from the mountains.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Argentwing Dell]] : This dell is strangely shaped like a butterfly, and may have been a holy site for some unknown religion.
; The [[Grim Jaws]] : These were the four tallest peaks in the Starspire range and were located east of the Trade Way.
; [[Mount Thargill]] : This easternmost peak in the range was a dead volcano and the location of the [[Wyrmwell]].
; [[Three Peaks Vale]] : This valley among the Grim Jaws was once the site of a monastery to [[Tyr]].
; Tomb of Zahyra : This crypt was the burial site of the First Vizera of Tethyr. It was under the protection of the royal court.
; [[Tresper Hall]] : This castle was the official duchy seat of Lord [[Inselm Hhune]].
; The Wyrmwell : This was the second home of the dragon Balagos, within a lave tube of Mount Thargill.
