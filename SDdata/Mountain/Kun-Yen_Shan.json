        "mainbody": "The '''Kun-Yen Shan''' was a mountain range located in the [[Hordelands]].",
        "Geography": "The Kun-Yen Shan formed the northern rim of the sprawling [[Yehimal]] mountains, stretching from the [[A-Ling Shan]] in the west all the way to the province of [[Tabot]] and [[Kao Shan]] in [[Shou Lung]] to the east.",
        "Description": "The Kun-Yen Shan towered over the southern portion of the [[Katakoro Plateau]], ascending steeply from the low valley there. The range had jagged peaks rising {{SI|23000|ft}}) into the sky. Small glaciers could be seen filling some of the gaps between the towering peaks of the Kun-Yen Shan. Green, densely forested valleys that were free of glaciers were isolated and hidden deep within the mountains.",
        "Inhabitants": "Though most of the mountain range was bereft of life, the lush valleys supported [[deer]], [[monkey]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[tiger]]s. Rugged [[human]]s were scattered throughout the Kun-Yen Shan as well, seeking remoteness from civilization.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Cave of the Monkey]]\n* [[Valley of Exiles]]\n* [[Valley of Dog-Men]]\n* [[Valley of the Shan Sao]]"
