To the south lay the [[Bang Zi Mara Shan]] mountains closer to [[Chukei]] and the island of [[Talmaruk]], and to the west deep within the mountains was the [[Valley of Nanayok]]. At the northeast edge of the Mountains of Amara was the fallen [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Urvraunt]], a long-lost and never rediscovered ruin."
