The Lost Peaks,
These mountains, full of forests, dominated the north-western area of the High Forest. The Dessarin River originated from these mountain peaks. And they were located roughly  northeast of Waterdeep.
Located high on a plateau were the Fountains of Memory, which reflected visions of the past. Those who entered these pools in an attempt to return to those past events were said to be teleported to a random location.
These peaks were said to be as old as Toril itself.
A dwarven fortress once laid under the Lost Peaks. thousand years prior to the 14 century DR, some curse or an epidemic occurred in this area, exterminating the entire dwarven population whose remains were found next to their forge and in their homes.
In the late 15th century DR, the Shadovar created a secret village in the Lost Peaks to house their captured many chosen, such as Stedd Whitehorn of Lathander and Samayan of Chauntea.
Many fey&mdashnotably satyrs&mdashlived near these peaks. A large tribe of centaurs also called them home and kept out any hunters that came from Olostins Hold.
Many captured chosen were held here during the late 15th century DR.
