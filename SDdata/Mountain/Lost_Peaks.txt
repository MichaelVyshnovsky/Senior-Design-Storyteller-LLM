The '''Lost Peaks''',

==Geography==
These mountains, full of forests, dominated the north-western area of the High Forest. The [[Dessarin River]] originated from these mountain peaks. And they were located roughly {{SI|500|miles|k|long=yes}} northeast of [[Waterdeep]].

Located high on a plateau were the [[Fountains of Memory]], which reflected visions of the past. Those who entered these pools in an attempt to return to those past events were said to be [[teleport]]ed to a random location.

==History==
These peaks were said to be as old as [[Toril]] itself.

A [[dwarf|dwarven]] fortress once laid under the Lost Peaks. thousand years prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some curse or an epidemic occurred in this area, exterminating the entire dwarven population whose remains were found next to their forge and in their homes.

In the late 15<sup>th</sup> century DR, the [[Shadovar]] created a secret village in the Lost Peaks to house their captured many [[chosen]], such as [[Stedd Whitehorn]] of [[Lathander]] and [[Samayan]] of [[Chauntea]].

==Inhabitants==
Many [[fey]]&mdash;notably [[satyr]]s&mdash;lived near these peaks. A large tribe of [[centaur]]s also called them home and kept out any hunters that came from [[Olostin's Hold]].

Many captured chosen were held here during the late 15<sup>th</sup> century DR.
