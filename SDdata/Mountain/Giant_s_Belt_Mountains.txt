}}The '''Giant's Belt Mountains''' marked the northeastern border of the [[Beastlands]] and [[Durpar]]. The [[Aerilpar Forest]] lay at the foot of this mountain range, as well.

The monsters who destroyed [[Veldorn]] came from the Giant's Belt Mountains, making them the origin point of the Beastlands themselves.<ref>
