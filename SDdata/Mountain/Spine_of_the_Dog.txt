The Spine of the Dog was a long, thin stretch of mountains that formed much of the border with West Zakhara and the shores of Suq Bay and the Golden Gulf.
The Spine of the Dog appeared to break from the Mountains of the Lizards Tongue near the Sea of Caravans, running east along Al-Tariq Channel and turning south along both quarters of Suq Bay before turning back west toward the High Desert as it entered the territory of the Pearl Cities.
Though relatively thin, the Spine of the Dog ran for over a thousand miles along the eastern perimeter of the sub-continent that was West Zakhara.
