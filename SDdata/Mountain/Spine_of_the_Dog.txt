The '''Spine of the Dog''' was a long, thin stretch of mountains that formed much of the border with [[West Zakhara]] and the shores of [[Suq Bay]] and the [[Golden Gulf]].

==Geography==
The Spine of the Dog appeared to break from the [[Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue]] near the [[Sea of Caravans]], running east along [[Al-Tariq Channel]] and turning south along both quarters of Suq Bay before turning back west toward the [[High Desert]] as it entered the territory of the [[Pearl Cities]].

==Description==
Though relatively thin, the Spine of the Dog ran for over a thousand miles along the eastern perimeter of the sub-continent that was West Zakhara.
