Mount Ghaethluntar, also known as the Great Mount of Ghaethluntar, was a huge mountain located in the extreme north of Faerûn.
This lone mountain stood nearly  in length. The base of the mountain was home to roaming herds of surface rothé, while it was said that the mountain itself was honeycombed with caverns linked by natural and carved-out tunnels, inhabited by thousands of flinds and gnolls.
The gnolls sent caravans down the Remorhaz Ride through the icy tundra, hauling 40 to 60 ore-laden sledges at a time from Mount Ghaethluntar to Frozen Flindyke.
