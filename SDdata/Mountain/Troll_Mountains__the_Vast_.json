        "mainbody": "The '''Troll Mountains''', also called the '''Trollcrag Mountains''', was a small mountain range in the [[Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]], running north of the [[River Vesper]] from the [[Dragon Reach]] in the west to the [[Earthspur Mountains]] in the east.{{Cite web/More of the Underdark and the Vast}}<ref group=\"note\">Page 77 of the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' 2{{nd}} edition (revised): \"A Grand Tour of the Realms\"]] names the mountains here the \"Earthspur Mountains\", while the maps accompanying the box set name them the Trollcrag Mountains. ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'' instead names this section of the range the \"Troll Mountains\". The discrepancy is solved by page 147 of ''The City of Ravens Bluff'' stating that they are \"sometimes called the Troll Mountains\" and [[Rand's Travelogue|\"Rand's Travelogue: More of the Underdark and the Vast\"]] confirming them to be an arm of the Earthspurs.",
        "Geographical Features": "The Troll Mountains were an arm of the greater Earthspur Mountains.\n\nThey held two major passes, [[Viperstongue]] and [[Three Trees Pass]]. In the east, Three Trees Pass was a long cleft between the Troll Mountains and the Earthspur or [[Giantspike Mountains]], along which the [[North Road]] ran.\n\nThe mountains were riddled with old dwarven mine tunnels.",
        "Inhabitants": "As the name said, [[trolls]] once hunted the slopes and valleys of the range, but they were nearly wiped out by the [[dwarves]], leaving few trolls by [[1370 DR]]. The dwarves made their homes in mines in high mountains by Three Trees Pass.",
        "History": "The dwarven mines of the Troll Mountains were at one time rich in [[iron]] and [[copper]], but these were thoroughly worked out by 1370 DR, producing very little metal. The disused passages were overrun by monsters."
