Mount Turbold was a mountain in the Kuldin Peaks of Erlkazar.
Long before the kingdom of Erlkazar came into existence, an ancient battle between giants and dwarves from Shanatar took place on this mountain and in the valley to the north. The mountain and the valley were named after the leader of the dwarves, Turbold.
Turbolds burial site was supposedly located in a crypt hidden somewhere in the mountain, containing his treasures and those of the dwarves he led who were also buried there. Turbolds Golden Axe was the most famous artifact said to be resting there.
