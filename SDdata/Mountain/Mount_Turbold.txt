'''Mount Turbold''' was a mountain in the [[Kuldin Peaks]] of [[Erlkazar]].

==History==
Long before the kingdom of Erlkazar came into existence, an ancient battle between [[giant]]s and [[Dwarf|dwarves]] from [[Shanatar]] took place on this mountain and in the [[Turbold Vale|valley to the north]]. The mountain and the valley were named after the leader of the dwarves, [[Turbold]].

==Rumor's==
Turbold's burial site was supposedly located in a crypt hidden somewhere in the mountain, containing his treasures and those of the dwarves he led who were also buried there. [[Turbold's Golden Axe]] was the most famous artifact said to be resting there.
