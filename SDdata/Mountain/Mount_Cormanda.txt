Mount Cormanda was an active volcano located in southern Skelkor, Laerakond.
When the Spellplague transported Laerakond to Toril, the demon lord Cormanda went to explore the new continent. However, a burst of Spellplague hit Cormanda and fused it with the volcano, which was later renamed after the demon lord. As of 1479 DR, the demon lord was still trapped inside Mount Cormandas lava tube.
