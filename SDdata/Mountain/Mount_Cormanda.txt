'''Mount Cormanda''' was an active volcano located in southern [[Skelkor]], [[Laerakond]].

==History==
When the [[Spellplague]] transported Laerakond to [[Toril]], the [[demon lord]] [[Cormanda]] went to explore the new continent. However, a burst of Spellplague hit Cormanda and fused it with the volcano, which was later renamed after the demon lord. As of [[1479 DR]], the demon lord was still trapped inside Mount Cormanda's lava tube.
