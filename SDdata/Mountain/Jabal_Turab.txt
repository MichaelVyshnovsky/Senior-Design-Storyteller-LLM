'''Jabal Turab''', or the '''Mount of Dust''', was a mountain that housed an [[elemental vortices|elemental vortex]] connecting two [[elemental plane]]s.

==Location==
Located {{SI|80|mi|k|long=yes}} from the [[City of Brass]], the Mount of Dust belched forth a great plume of white smoke that served as a gateway from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]. The elemental vortex terminated outside of the [[Djinni Caliphate]].

This elemental vortex was used by the [[efreet]] to launch invasions on the [[djinn]]. The efreet kept it under constant guard to prevent the djinn from using it in the same fashion.
