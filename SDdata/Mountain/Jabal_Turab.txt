Jabal Turab, or the Mount of Dust, was a mountain that housed an elemental vortex connecting two elemental planes.
Located  from the City of Brass, the Mount of Dust belched forth a great plume of white smoke that served as a gateway from the Elemental Plane of Fire to the Elemental Plane of Air. The elemental vortex terminated outside of the Djinni Caliphate.
This elemental vortex was used by the efreet to launch invasions on the djinn. The efreet kept it under constant guard to prevent the djinn from using it in the same fashion.
