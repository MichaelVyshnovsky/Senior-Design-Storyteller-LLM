The Spines of Surkh, or more commonly known as the Spines of the Serpent by the locals, were the southern peaks of the Deepwing Mountains of the Vilhon Reach.
The mountains of Surkh were a traditional burial land of the lizardfolk inhabitants of the city of Surkh. The entire mountain chain was littered with small and shallow lizard tombs. Teachings of the lizardfolk deity Semuanya did not encourage defensive magics for these final resting places. With time passing, many of the tombs became infested with various undead, ghouls being the most common among them. However, grave-robbing was considered a capital crime, and those who were caught desecrating lizardfolk crypts were convicted to being devoured alive.
The Spines of the Serpent rose up immodestly to the north of the City of Lizard â€“ Surkh and bordered the Deepwash, a huge freshwater basin.
The Spines of Surkh had at least three ancient tombs of Okothian sarrukh.
The Deepwing Portal was a magic gate hidden high in the mountaintops of the Spines of the Serpent. The portal was a large flat stone decorated with images of snakes and serpentine emblems. When activated, it led to the mouth of the Great Petrified Serpent in the Serpent Hills in the Western Heartlands.
Among lizardfolk and undead, the Spines of Surkh were known to be plagues by illithid slavers who emerged from deep caverns in the mountains. The aberrant creatures emerged from hidden psionic gates that connected the caverns with Oryndoll, the City of Loretakers in the Lowerdark.
