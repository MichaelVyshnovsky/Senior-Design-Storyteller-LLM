The '''Spines of Surkh''', or more commonly known as the '''Spines of the Serpent''' by the locals, were the southern peaks of the [[Deepwing Mountains]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
The mountains of Surkh were a traditional burial land of the [[lizardfolk]] inhabitants of the city of [[Surkh]]. The entire mountain chain was littered with small and shallow lizard tombs. Teachings of the lizardfolk deity [[Semuanya]] did not encourage defensive magics for these final resting places. With time passing, many of the tombs became infested with various [[undead]], [[ghoul]]s being the most common among them. However, grave-robbing was considered a capital crime, and those who were caught desecrating lizardfolk crypts were convicted to being devoured alive.

==Geography==
The Spines of the Serpent rose up immodestly to the north of the City of Lizard – Surkh and bordered the [[Deepwash]], a huge freshwater basin.

==Notable Locations==
The Spines of Surkh had at least three ancient tombs of [[Okoth]]ian [[sarrukh]].

The ''[[Deepwing Portal]]'' was a magic ''[[gate]]'' hidden high in the mountaintops of the Spines of the Serpent. The ''portal'' was a large flat stone decorated with images of snakes and serpentine emblems. When activated, it led to the mouth of the [[Great Petrified Serpent]] in the [[Serpent Hills]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Inhabitants==
Among lizardfolk and undead, the Spines of Surkh were known to be plagues by [[illithid]] slavers who emerged from deep caverns in the mountains. The aberrant creatures emerged from hidden ''[[psionic gate]]s'' that connected the caverns with [[Oryndoll]], the City of Loretakers in the [[Lowerdark]].
