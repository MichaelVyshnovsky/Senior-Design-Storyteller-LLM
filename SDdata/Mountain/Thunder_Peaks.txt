The '''Thunder Peaks''' were a range of mountains that ran in a north&ndash;south line, marking the eastern edge of [[Cormyr]]. The entire range was subject to extremely severe and sudden storms all year round. They were home to tribes of [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s that launched raids in nearby Cormyr, [[Sembia]], and the [[Dalelands]], and were also home to the [[dracolich]] [[Aurgloroasa]], the Sibilant Shade. The Thunder Peaks once hosted the dwarven settlement of [[Thunderholme]].

The [[Thunder River]] flowed west out of the Thunder Peaks to the [[Wyvernwater]]. In [[Elven language|Elven]], the Thunder Peaks were called ''Airmbult'', or translated into [[Common]], Storm-Fangs.

==Flora==
The mountains had a number of unique species of plants, including the [[turis]] and [[kirin]] [[tree]]s, as well as [[Bowen's flower]]s. The scent of the heavily aromatic [[ateris]] plants would blow down to the town of [[Tilverton]] with strong winds.

==History==
According to the ''[[Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants]]'', after the first [[Rage of Dragons]], their [[kobold]] servitors were all but destroyed in the rampaging chaos of their masters. [[Kuraulyek]], a [[dragonwrought kobold]], led his winged [[Urd|kin]] to safety in the Thunder Peaks, escaping the dragons' wrath in the bat-filled caverns.<ref>

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Iron Maidens]], a band of female-only mercenaries, had their fortress in a formerly deserted castle hidden somewhere in the mountains.{{Cite polyhedron/55/The New Rogues Gallery: Iron Maidens|19}}
* The [[High Dale]] was nestled in a steep mountain pass in the Thunder Peaks.<ref> The most notable settlement of the High Dale was [[Highcastle]], home to High Dale's ruling body.
* The [[Dancing Place]], sacred location where the [[Gathering of the Gods]] took place, was located in a hidden valley a few miles north-east of [[Highcastle]].

==Landmarks==
* [[Wyvernfang]]: This summit at the apex the [[Thunder Peaks]] served as roost to a number of [[Wyvern]]s who would ambush travelers along the [[Thunder Way]].
* [[Manymists Mountain]]: This summit located east of the Dancing Place was rich with silver ore.
