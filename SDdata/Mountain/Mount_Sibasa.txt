Mount Sibasa was the tallest among the four hills in Chult atop which Port Nyanzaru was built. It was the easternmost of the four hills, and was located in the center of the Market Ward.
The top of Mount Sibasa was dominated by the glittering Hall of Gold, a grand temple of Waukeen. The hills steep slopes were characterized by terraces and stepped streets. A wide stone bridge connected the top of Mount Sibasa to the top of neighboring Yklwazi Hill to the west.
The top of Mount Silbasa near the Hall of Gold was the site of homes and shops.
