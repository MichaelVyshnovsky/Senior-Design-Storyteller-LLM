The '''Firecap Mountains''' were a small mountain range in [[northwest Faer没n]], part of the larger [[Ice Spires|Ice Spires South]].

==Geography==
This mountain range was largely dominated by a trio of semi-active volcanoes, known as the [[Three Sisters]], whose foothils were adjacent to a small dale that they kept warm.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Fire giant hall]], a [[fire giant]] settlement that was established following the tribe's displacer from [[Needle Peak]] by [[Hartkiller]]. It was situated on a plateau that joined two of the Three Sisters, upon which they dug around their complex a network of trenches filled with boiling [[oil]]. The sky around this hall was strategically blocked out by the giants with black smoke.
