The Firecap Mountains were a small mountain range in northwest Faerûn, part of the larger Ice Spires South.
This mountain range was largely dominated by a trio of semi-active volcanoes, known as the Three Sisters, whose foothils were adjacent to a small dale that they kept warm.
* Fire giant hall, a fire giant settlement that was established following the tribes displacer from Needle Peak by Hartkiller. It was situated on a plateau that joined two of the Three Sisters, upon which they dug around their complex a network of trenches filled with boiling oil. The sky around this hall was strategically blocked out by the giants with black smoke.
