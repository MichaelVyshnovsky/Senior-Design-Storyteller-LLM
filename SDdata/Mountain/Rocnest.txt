'''Rocnest''' was a high bowl-shaped outcrop in the [[Western Heartlands]], standing between [[Evereska]] and the [[Greycloak Hills]].

==History==
A natural citadel, Rocnest was used to garrison [[elf]] soldiers during the [[Crown Wars]], for a period lasting a thousand years. Following the fall of  [[Aryvandaar]], it was abandoned.

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Evereskan elves proposed reusing Rocnest as a watch post.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, on [[Nightal 30]], Rocnest was lost when forces from [[Waterdeep]] led by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] were too late to turn the tide against the [[phaerimm]] in the [[Battle of Rocnest]].
