The Aphrunn Mountains were a mountain range forming the southern border of the republic of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach. The mountains were visible from the island of Ilighôn on the other side of the Farshore Straits. Lilit Pass allowed passage through the Aphrunn, connecting Turmish to the Vilhon.
The gold dragon Frizzerfraz made his home in these mountains. A tribe of kobolds called the Scything Claw resided and in the Aphrunn and would occasionally raid into Turmish.
There was an active volcano in the Aphrunn mountains called Mount Kolimnis. In  the wizard Danirro of Alaghôn, on the behalf of the nearby city of Gildenglade attempted to quell the volcano through the use of magic. While he was in the process of casting a spell on the volcano, however, he was murdered by agents of the Emerald Enclave who threw him into Mount Kolimnis. The Enclave then destroyed all remains of Danirros research, warning others to not interfere with the volcano or other forces they did not understand.
The volcano erupted and destroyed Gildenglade in 1423 DR.
