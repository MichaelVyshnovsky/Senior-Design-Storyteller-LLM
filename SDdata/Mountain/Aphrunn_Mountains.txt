The '''Aphrunn Mountains''' were a mountain range forming the southern border of the republic of [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The mountains were visible from the island of [[Ilighôn]] on the other side of the [[Farshore Straits]].<ref name = "VRDMR-p24"> [[Lilit Pass]] allowed passage through the Aphrunn, connecting Turmish to the Vilhon.

The [[gold dragon]] [[Frizzerfraz]] made his home in these mountains. A tribe of kobolds called the [[Scything Claw]] resided and in the Aphrunn and would occasionally raid into Turmish.<ref name = "VRDMR-p42">

==Mount Kolimnis==
There was an active volcano in the Aphrunn mountains called Mount Kolimnis. In {{Yearlink|1360}} the wizard [[Danirro]] of [[Alaghôn]], on the behalf of the nearby city of [[Gildenglade]] attempted to quell the volcano through the use of magic.<ref name = "VRDMR-p41"/> While he was in the process of casting a spell on the volcano, however, he was murdered by agents of the [[Emerald Enclave]] who threw him into Mount Kolimnis.<ref name = "VRDMR-p42"/> The Enclave then destroyed all remains of Danirro's research, warning others to not interfere with the volcano or other forces they did not understand.<ref name = "VRDMR-p41"/>

The volcano erupted and destroyed Gildenglade in [[1423 DR]].
