Both the Southfill River and the Tarn River wound their ways from the peaks down to the Hidden Lake. \nLegend had it the southernmost peak, known as Hatchet Mountain was haunted by the ghost of Mad Dog, a fighter from before the first age of Netheril. Stade Mountain was said to be haunted by a diva with a bewitching voice. \nUntil , Netherese mines in the mountains were a productive source of metal ores including platinum, copper, brass, and steel. They were abandoned due to frequent monster attacks as the Netherese fought the Phaerimm.\nAfter the fall of Netheril the mountains were infested with monsters that the Netherese survivor states were not able to dislodge, despite frequent attempts."
