The '''Deepwing Mountains''' were a small, east&ndash;west mountain range southeast of the [[Shining Plains]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. They were located between the [[Orsraun Mountains]] and the [[Cloven Mountains]] and north of the [[Deepwash]].

At the western end of the range, the mountains gave way to rough, rocky hills known as the [[Rushing Hills]],<ref> while the southwestern mountains were known as the [[Spines of Surkh]], which encircled [[Surkh]] to the north and east and were home to many tombs and burial sites of the [[lizardfolk]] who dwelt there.<ref> 

The mountains were populated with a number of large, flying monsters, including [[manticore]]s, [[griffon]]s and [[hippogriff]]s, [[red dragon]]s, and [[wyvern]]s.
