The '''Wall of Fallen Djinn''' was a range of mountains and foothills found in [[The Sword]] region of southern [[Anauroch]].

==Description==
They appeared as a literal wall of brown rock earth that rose above the desert floor.

==Geography==
Located in the center of The Sword, the Wall of Fallen Djinn was situated between three great landmarks of the region: the [[Hills of Scent]] to the north, the [[Shoal of Thirst]] to the east, and the [[Saiyaddar]] to the south.

===Geographical Features===
The Wall's foothills of the range were intercut by brush-covered ravines.

===Flora & Fauna===
The slopes of the mountains were mottled with copses of [[qassis]] and [[acacia]] trees.

==History==
During the time of [[Netheril]] the range was known as the Shinantra Mountains after a group of elusive hairy humanoids that inhabited the range since before humans arrived. They were believed to have perished with the encroachment of the desert after the fall of Netheril.

An ancient battle between the [[Bedine]] tribespeople and a group of [[djinn]] was the source of the mountains' unique name. According to Bedine lore, every member of the tribe died while fighting off the djinn,

==Notable Locations==
* [[Sister of Rains]], an oasis situated in a valley located at the bottom of the range's highest peak.
