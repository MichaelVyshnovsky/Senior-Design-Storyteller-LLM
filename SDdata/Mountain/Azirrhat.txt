'''Azirrhat''', meaning '''the Slashed Rocks''' in [[Common]], was a small cluster of peaks located in [[the Sword]] region of [[Anauroch]]. More recently the spelling Azrrhat has become accepted.<ref>Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition map

==Description==
The spires of Azirrhat were arranged in a form that resembled the foot of a [[chicken]].

==Geography==
They were located in the northeast region of The Sword, north of the [[Colored Waters]] oasis.

==History==
Some time around the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], agents of the [[Zhentarim]] made contact with the [[asabi]] of Azirrhat in order to garner allies for their takeover of overland trade across Anauroch.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some native [[Bedine]] people spoke of finding deposits of [[gold]] within the clefts found between the peaks.

==Inhabitants==
The underground caverns and chasms beneath Azirrhat were home to a large population of asabis, nocturnal hunters that were a threat to any creatures that dared pass close by the peaks at night.
