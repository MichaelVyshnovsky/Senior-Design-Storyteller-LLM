The '''Spire of Kor''' towered over the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]] about {{SI|10|mi|k}} west of the village of [[Raziz]].

==Description==
The Spire of Kor was a massive natural granite column, rising {{SI|400|ft}} over the steaming sands below.  It was topped by a plateau of black quartz.

==History==
Around the mid 1200's [[DR]], the Spire of Kor was claimed by nine mystics from the small village of Raziz in honor of [[Kor]], the Great God of Wisdom. Aided by a [[djinni]], they eventually created a pathway that wound from the base of the tower all the way to the top where they conducted religious ceremonies on the plateau.  Later, a caravan from [[Tajar]] discovered the bodies of the nine mystics at the base of the tower.  Once per year, on the holy day of [[Ahad]], the [[skeleton]]s of the mystics rise from the sand, climb the spire, and spend all day praying to Kor for forgiveness.  They return to their graves with the rising of the sun.
