        "mainbody": "The '''Smokeholes''' were steam-spewing holes located in the [[High Ice]] with the deadly [[Caverns of Burning Ice]] directly below.",
        "Description": "These large round vents were constantly shrouded in clouds of steam created by snow and ice melting in the streams of hot air and noxious gasses erupting from underneath. The scalding hot air was coming from the Caverns of Burning Ice underneath, filled with lava flows and melting ice. The caverns were extensive and unexplored.\n\nThe Smokeholes were little-known locations in the High Ice. They rarely were marked on maps, along with the [[Rift of Stars]], and [[Llashloch]], the Lake of Ice.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The Smokeholes and smaller and even tiny vents that were found nearby were used by certain [[dragon]]s who laired in hidden grottoes heated by the steam and escaping gasses.\n\nThe vents, despite being dangerous, were far from uninhabitable. Monsters were known to dwell in the Caverns of Burning Ice. [[Fire snake]]s and [[salamander]]s were among them and often tried to drag unwary and curious travelers into the hot lava vents."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Many stories about rich untapped veins of [[ore]] attracted many unwitting prospectors to the vents. These legends did not seem to be rooted in reality and likely just provided the salamanders within with fresh dwarven meat. Another rumor talked about a powerful being commanding the salamanders to attack anyone who strayed close, supposedly defending some unknown treasure deep in the lava caves underneath."
