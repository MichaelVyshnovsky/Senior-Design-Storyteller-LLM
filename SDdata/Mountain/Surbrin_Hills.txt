The Surbrin Hills was a grouping of hills found in the Savage Frontier, just north of the Dessarin Valley. 
The northern hills held the ancestral mound of the Uthgardt Griffon tribe, called Griffons Nest. As such, few travelers ventured near the region.
In addition to the Uthgardt barbarians, the Surbrin Hills housed orcs, hill giants and other monstrous beings.
