'''Spotter's Peak''' was a tall mountain in the [[Storm Horns]] of [[Cormyr]], the Forest Kingdom.

==Geography==
Spotter's Peak loomed over the fortress of [[Castle Crag]] and [[Gnoll Pass]]. The mountain stood directly to the northeast of the castle on the eastern side of Gnoll Pass. The [[Cliff of Lost Lovers]] stood on the opposite side of the mountain range to Spotter's Peak's northeast. The closest road to the mountain was the [[Dragon Trail]] to the south, stretching from the Gnoll Pass, past the [[Castle Crag]], and ending in the mining village of [[Hillmarch]].
