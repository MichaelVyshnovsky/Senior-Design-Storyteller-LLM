The '''Nether Mountains''' were a chain of dark peaks that once marked the boundary between the ancient empires of [[Netheril]] and [[Delzoun]]. 

==History==
Many travelers avoided these peaks, because several [[orc]] tribes laired in the region, such as the [[Thousand Fists]] and the [[Ripped Gut]] tribes who fought ferociously over the [[Moon Pass]], a large gorge that split the mountains into its eastern and western ranges. Around [[1372 DR]], the orcs made an uneasy truce, making them an even greater threat to anyone traveling the region. 

==Geography==
The greatest danger within these mountains were an entire clan of [[blue dragon]]s known as the [[Morueme]] which resided in [[Morueme's Cave]] on the high slope of the mountain peak aptly named [[Dragondoom]]. The [[dragon]]s' threat was only enhanced by the servitude of a large tribe of [[hobgoblin]]s called the [[Red Flayers]], who maintain the [[Doomspire]], a citadel carved into the rock, and protect their masters with an almost deific reverence.

==Inhabitants==
The peaks were also home to dozens of other dangerous monster species making them one of the most inhospitable wild regions in all [[Faerûn]]. There were even suggestions that portals or [[deepspawn]] were responsible for the amazing abundance of monsters roaming the higher slopes of the Nether Mountains. For those daring enough to brave the dangers, [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]] could be mined in quantity. Finally, many adventurers hunted the mountains in search of the legends of lost caches of Netherese magic.

Following the destruction of [[Hellgate Keep]] in [[1369 DR]], five tribes of displaced [[tanarukk]]a began to wander these mountains, numbering over 1,200 in all.
