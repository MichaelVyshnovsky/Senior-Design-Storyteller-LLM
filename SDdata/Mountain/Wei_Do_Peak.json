        "mainbody": "Wei Do Peak was a mountain in the eastern Vorkani Mountains in the realm of Koryo in Kara-Tur.\nEach year after he took the throne in the 1350s DR, a three-day-long ceremony was held on Wei Do Peak to honor King Wanang Sun and his new dynasty. Many monks and shukenja attended the festival, and bestowed blessings on the king and his court. It culminated with the king himself ritually beheading the most infamous criminal in the kingdoms prisons. This act symbolized his power to defeat evil in the kingdom.\nIt was rumored that when the king wielded the Golden Sword of Ammatok to do this duty, a spirit of the Celestial Heavens would appear beside him and consecrate his rule under their guidance.\nCategoryMountains\nCategoryLocations in Silla\nCategoryLocations in the Vorkani Mountains\nCategoryLocations in Koryo\nCategoryLocations in Northeast Kara-Tur\nCategoryLocations in Kara-Tur\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nkypelm7s4q8rlawuh6sps7xnuwbn8dv"
