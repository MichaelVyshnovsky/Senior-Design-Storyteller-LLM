Highpeak was one of the peaks of the Orcskull Mountains, on the island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles.
This particular mountain was on the northwestern side of the Orcskull Mountains.
In the midâ€“14 century, Elminster visited King Dagdar, and they explored Moray. During one of the nights, a frightening cry was heard by both men. The king explained that it was the maiden of Highpeak, who cried out for her childrens lost souls. He then explained the maidens tale to the Old Mage.
During the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, a soul upon the Fugue Plane claimed to have killed Astolpho of Highpeak with their blade.It was unknown whether this referred to the same "Highpeak" as the one in this article, but, for completion, it is noted here.
According to an old Moonshae tale, a woman and her sons dwelt in a grand glass castle atop the peak. The sons grew tired of living in the castle, and so they constructed a glass bridge to a nearby mountain, and set out to explore. However, as they left, the castle disappeared. All but the oldest son died in battle, and returned home via the bridge during a bitter winter. As he crossed it, he slipped on the ice and fell to his death. The woman became known as the maiden of Highpeak, and her cries could be heard during hot summers or freezing winters. The tale concluded with the thought that, one day, a descendant of the maiden would rediscover the castle and relieve their mothers suffering.
