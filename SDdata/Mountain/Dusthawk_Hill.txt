'''Dusthawk Hill''' was a tall, [[granite]] hill located on the northern bank of the [[River Chionthar]], just east of the walled city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, it was surrounded on nearly all sides by the Gate's [[Outer City]].

==Description==
The sides of the hill had steep-faced cliffs of yellow granite that rose high above the Outer City slums of Baldur's Gate.

Beneath the hill were a series of sea caves that were rumored to house a den of [[werewolves]].

==Wildlife==
Dusthawk Hill earned its name for being one of the final roosting places of the [[Chionthar Dusthawk]].

==History==
During the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the hill was declared as private land that was protected from any non-licensed hunters. This action was taken by Baldurian officials to preserve the dwindling population of the Chionthar Dusthawk. Outer City residents begrudged the fact the land was given more care and protection than their own neighborhoods by the city's wealthy [[patriar]] families.
