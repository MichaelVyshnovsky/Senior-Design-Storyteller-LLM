        "mainbody": "he Toadsquat Mountains, or the Little Mountains, formed the northern border of Luiren in the Shining South in 1367 DR.\nThis mountain range was infested with ogres. Attracted by the mountains rich silver deposits, dwarves helped clear some of the ogre tribes in the east to gain access to mines. Rage drakes were also commonly found as far south as the Toadsquats. Criosphinxes were also sometimes encountered in the region.\nThe Toadsquat Mountains were slumped alongside the Beastlands southern shore. Among their secrets, the fortress of Castle Alhanar, which resided on the west bank of Blood Lake.\nThe magical greatsword Chalsembyrs Heart was lost somewhere in the Toadsquat Mountains when its owner Bertold the Seeker, a paladin of Torm, and his party were ambushed by ogres.\nIt was rumored that a large cache of magic was buried or stored deep beneath the western Toadsquats, particularly beneath the peaks known as Klauntras Leap, the Wyrmlar, and Liontlefang. An alchemist from Klionna, living in Delzimmer circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, named Urngath Dorrund apparently believed this rumor enough to pay mercenaries to round up goblins from the area, thinking their blood had magical properties because they drank from mountain springs that welled up through this store of magic."
