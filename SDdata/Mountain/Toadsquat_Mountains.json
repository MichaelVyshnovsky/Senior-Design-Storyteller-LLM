An [[alchemist]] from [[Klionna]], living in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], named [[Urngath Dorrund]] apparently believed this rumor enough to pay mercenaries to round up goblins from the area, thinking their blood had magical properties because they drank from mountain springs that welled up through this store of magic."
