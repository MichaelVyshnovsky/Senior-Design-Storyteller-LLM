The '''Chigidi Mountains''' were a mountain range in the [[Plain of Horses]] region.

==Geography==
Standing in the north and east, the range occupied almost half of the land counted as the Plain of Horses, making it something of a misnomer. In the northern arm, the peaks stood {{SIrange|7000|10000|ft|long=yes}} tall, but in the main eastern section they surpassed {{SI|15000|ft|long=yes}}. Dominating the surrounding lands, they formed a natural barrier between the Plain of Horses and the [[Ama Basin]] in the north and [[Shou Lung]] in the east, protecting the Plain of Horses from invasion or raids from either side.

The [[Anai River]] had its headwaters in the northern Chigidi and [[Chigiogi Mountains]]. Once branch meandered southward through the northern Chigidi Mountains, while another flowed northward into the Ama Basin.

==Description==
The range was rugged and rocky and the northern peaks were capped in ice and snow throughout the year. At these heights, the temperature was so low that one's breath froze one one's face even in the summer months. Moreover, the soil was infertile, forbidding any agriculture apart from the mountain flanks facing the forested [[Wikipedia:taiga|taiga]] in the south.

===Geographical Features===
Two known peaks were [[Mount Juqan]] and [[Mount Or-Ghash]], which was a sacred site to local [[lama]]s.

==Notable Locations==
Several Plainsmen cities were established in the Chigidi Mountains: [[Alamaqu]], a tent city of the [[T'aghur]] tribe lying in a valley in the central eastern mountains; [[Li-Raz]], the great city of the [[Fankiang]] tribe near the south-western edge; and [[Jugicha]], the home of the [[Tsu-tsu]] tribe in the southwestern tip.
