While there, they built a wooden bridge across Mount Drakor Rouge's crater and carved out what would become the [[Temple of the Dragon Oracle]] on its central rocky landmass. They then filled its salt marsh with a variety of creatures in order to protect the temple. [[Witch]]es among this cell of Dragon Cultists believed that the [[sulfur]]ous vapors within the crater's lava caves would help them to [[divination|prophesize]] the future.\n\nSome time between the {{YearlinkName|1151}} and the {{YearlinkName|1174}}, some evil force overran the temple and forced its Dragon Cultists to abandon it.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1358}},{{ShatteredStatue-Time}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"YearConfusion\">Page 16 of ''The Shattered Statue'' states that Flashfire \"...came south several years ago in the dragon invasion that destroyed the city of [[Phlan]] on the shores of the [[Moonsea]].\" This describes the event known as the [[Flight of Dragons]], which occurred in [[1356 DR]]. However, that page also states that Flashfire only moved into the Temple of the Dragon Oracle recently. For more information on this, see Note 1. an adult [[red dragon]] by the name of [[Flashfire]] settled within the abandoned Temple of the Dragon Oracle and subjugated its gargoyle inhabitants."
