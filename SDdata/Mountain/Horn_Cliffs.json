        "mainbody": "The Horn Cliffs were coastal cliffs of County Firedrake, on the northernmost tip of the Dragons Head Peninsula, named after their position as the \"horns\" of the dragon head-shaped peninsula in Tethyr.\nThe Horn Cliffs could be found to the east of the city of Velen, past ducal castle Tordraken. Pearl oyster-rich Acovals Cove was located on the western side of the \"horn.\"\nThe cliffs were a perfect seabird habitat but not much else. There were no settlements along the Horn Cliffs due to their height, yet the bluff hid numerous caves that attracted bandits, people, down on their luck, curious adventurers, and an occasional ambitious merchant in search of some hidden treasure. These visitors attracted monsters who happily fed on unwitting would-be adventurers.\nThe origin of the Horn Cliffs remained a mystery to sages. During the period of time from around 1350 DR to 1370 DR, those show delved into the cliffs caverns and emerged with treasures on at least two occasions. One of the recovered treasures were the the Purple Keys spellbooks that once belonged to Waterdhavian Magist Guildmaster, the other were Seven Dancers â€“ golden Sunite statues.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Velen stationed ballistae and catapult batteries along the Horn Cliffs. Other neighboring areas that held Velens defenses included the Blackthorn Manor, Tordraken, and the city proper. Velens fortifications on the Horn Cliffs were placed in the area called the Prow and were guarded by a garrison.\n*Some of the stories that surrounded the Horn Cliffs claimed that at least one Tethyrean treasury was hidden somewhere within the coastal caves."
