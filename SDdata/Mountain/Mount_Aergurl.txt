Mount Aergurl, known earlier as The Sleeper In The Sunrise, was a mountain in the Vast in north Faerûn. It lay within the Giantspike Mountains, a part of the Earthspur Mountains, and was due east of the village of Maskyrs Eye.
Described as a long rising peak, down Aergurls slope ran a creek that had carved a high cleft. Though hazardous, this cleft formed a pass through the mountains, leading to high chilly valleys and ultimately the Glacier of the White Worm.
The pass was little known to humans in the mid–14 century DR. The folk of Maskyrs Eye were aware of it, but did not talk about it to outsiders, but their hunters warned of an unnatural cold beyond the Sleeper.
The local dwarves had a legend of how the dwarf hero Aurgus killed a remorhaz single-handedly in the mountain pass.
Once, orcs marched through the pass to attack the dwarves who made their delves in the mountains near Kurth.This is undated, but may be part of the orc attack on Roldilar in 649 DR.
However, no army had come through it within the lifetime of humans by the late 1350s DR.
