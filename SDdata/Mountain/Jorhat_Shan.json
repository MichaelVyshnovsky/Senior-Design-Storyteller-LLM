        "mainbody": "The Jorhat Shan were a pair of tall mountains located in the Endless Wastes.\nLocated between Solon in the Raurin Desert, and Ra-Khati in the Katakoro Shan mountain range, sat the twin mountains of Jorhat Shan.\nThe Jorhat Shan, which meant \"Two Brothers Mountains\", was considered one of the major landmarks of the Endless Wastes. The mountains themselves rose  above sea level and were known to be barren and rocky, with few trees or plants growing on their slopes.\nLocated on the Jorhat Shan was an ancient fortress known only as the Fortress of Jorhat.\nMost people hurried past this location, due to rumors of the site being haunted by those killed there."
