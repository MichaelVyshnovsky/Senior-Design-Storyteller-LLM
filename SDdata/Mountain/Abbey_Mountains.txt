The '''Abbey Mountains, '''also known as the ''' Turnback Mountains,''' were a range of tall peaks in the [[Moonsea North]] region of [[north Faerun]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}} They were originally known as the '''Columns of the Sky''' to the [[Rengarth]] [[barbarian]]s during the [[Golden Age of Netheril|Golden Age]] of [[Netheril]],<ref group="note">While there is no source that states the mountains are the same, the [[Akoro]] [[goliath]]s of [[Mount Akoro]] traced their history back to ancient [[Netheril]]. Mount Akoro is clearly stated as part of the Abbey Mountain range. and also known as '''Rabrae Hyuk''' to the local [[gnoll]] population.''Hyar'' is rock or loose stone in the [[Gnoll language]], ''hyukla'' is a crag or spire, and ''hyuk'' is a mountain or range of mountains; "Rabrae" was the name of these mountains, an apparent echo/corruption of "Abbey"

==Description==
The range was quite frigid and windswept, with only the topmost peaks getting consistent snow caps.{{Cite web | author=Greenwood, Ed | authorlink=Ed Greenwood | publisher=Twitter | date=June 2020 | title=News from the EdVerse | url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1272287816244920322}}

==Geography==
The Abbey Mountains were located between the [[Tortured Land]] and the [[Frozen Forest]], southwest of the [[Great Glacier]].

===Geographical Features===
The foothills along the northern face of the Abbey range were known locally as the "Mammothbacks".{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|64}} 

One third of the way along the range from its eastern end was [[Turnback Mountain]], which was a distinctively tall peak among other heights to the north and south. Its name came from being where an ancient prospector expedition, after finding little of worth but endless creatures wanting them dead, finally took heed from their heavy losses and nigh-ceaseless attacks and decided to turn back. Extensive expeditions over the ages have found relatively few veins of ore worth mining in the range.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48}}{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|80}}

A very cold river, the [[Alaphaer Run]], flowed north out of the western Abbey Mountains and into the nearby Frozen Forest. Following the course of the river led to the mysterious step pyramid known as the [[Monument of the Ancients]].

==History==
At the end of the [[Time of Dragons|Age of Dragons]], tens of thousands of years before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the [[stone giant]]s of [[Moch-Fanan]] were forced to abandon their great fortress in [[Pelvuria]] and relocated into the Abbey Mountains.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|81}}

The Abbey Mountains name came from the the days of [[Netheril]], when worshipers of [[Selûne]] built the [[Abbey of the Moon]] atop [[Selûne's Crest]], the highest peak of the range. Once a magnificent building, the site is now a toppled ruin of shattered stone columns, foundations, and monster-haunted cellars.

For centuries they had been used for the caching of treasure, the entombment of barbarian chieftains from [[the Ride]], and as natural funnel hunting traps by local gnolls to lure [[rothé]] and [[caribou]] herds to their doom.

More recent adventuring expeditions reported that there were no less than two [[dragon]] lairs and three shattered but extensive ruins, possibly fallen [[Netherese]] [[Netherese enclave|flying cities]] hidden away in the deep and rarely visited valleys at the heart of the range.
