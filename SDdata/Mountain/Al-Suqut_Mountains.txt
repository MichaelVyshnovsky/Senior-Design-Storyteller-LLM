Al-Suqut Mountains, or the Tumbling Mountains, were found in west Zakhara.
Al-Suqut Mountains separated the western "border" of the Pearl Cities from the Great Sea. They were situated just south of the High Desert. 
The mountains were strung along the western coast of the southern portion of west Zakhara, sitting in a roughly linear north to south position.
Al-Suqut Mountains were believed to harbor mad wizards, unenlightened tribes, and sea-faring brigands.
