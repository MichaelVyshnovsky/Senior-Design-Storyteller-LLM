        "mainbody": "'''Ascal's Horn''' was a jutting natural peak in the northeastern edge of [[High Forest]], in an area known as the [[Upvale]].",
        "History": "Around the year [[-4500 DR]], when Ascal's Horn was merely a volcanic crag, the seven remaining members of the [[demon]]-corrupted [[House Dlardrageth]] took shelter within its series of caves. A dozen [[High Mages]] from [[Arcorar]], alongside the heirs of [[Rystall Wood]] and [[Jhyrennstar]], had managed to track them down. A battle ensued, leading to the death of four of House Dlardrageth's members. The High Mages used stasis magic to seal the rest of the survivors within these caves. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-372}}, the [[Eaerlann]]i elves founded the fortress town of Ascal's Horn, which would later come to be known as [[Hellgate Keep]], from which the peak's name was eventually derived. Though some claimed that the peak was already named Ascal's Horn prior to this and that the settlement had derived its name from the peak itself.\n\nCenturies later in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the [[Mistmaster]] used the power of the [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]'' to destroy Hellgate Keep both above and below ground, unleashing such severe destruction upon Ascal's Horn that a massive ravine was left in its wake and a second rift opened along the outcrop upon which the Keep was once perched. The ravine later became known as Grintharke's Gulch, a name that was coined by a [[bard]] for the sake of alliteration, while the rift became known as Razorthorn Rift and was one of the first places tended to by the [[treant]]s of [[Turlang]] that quickly came to inhabit the area.\n\nAround the spring and summer of [[1370 DR]], the treants planted trees along the cliff in hopes of breaking up its rocks and further eroding it.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], the forces of Turlang and the Druids of Tall Trees were still working together towards reforesting the area. The druids were known to be providing them assistance in the form of [[magic]], protection, and the nurturing of new tree spouts.",
        "Geography": "Ascal's Horn laid along a bend in the Ascal Stream, later known as Skull Stream, the westernmost source river of the more prominent [[Delimbiyr River]].\n\nFollowing 1369 DR, much of the cliff was taken up by the central, inverted-pyramid shaped ravine known as Grintharke's Gulch. At the time the gorge measured {{SI|600|ft}} long on each side and around {{SI|400|ft}} deep.It's stated in the [[Hellgate Keep (adventure)|''Hellgate Keep'']] adventure's epilogue that the gulch was later widened, thus it stands to reason that these given measurements may no longer be accurate following [[1370 DR]]. The primary means of entering the gulch was Razorthorn Rift, which ran along the southern outcrop upon that Hellgate Keep was once perched. However, the area was blocked off to outsiders by the treants with sharp patches of brier and thorn that stood {{SI|30|ft}} tall and stretched on across {{SI|50|ft}} of land."
