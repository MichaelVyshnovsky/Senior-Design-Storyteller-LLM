        "mainbody": "Ascals Horn was a jutting natural peak in the northeastern edge of High Forest, in an area known as the Upvale.\nAround the year -4500 DR, when Ascals Horn was merely a volcanic crag, the seven remaining members of the demon-corrupted House Dlardrageth took shelter within its series of caves. A dozen High Mages from Arcorar, alongside the heirs of Rystall Wood and Jhyrennstar, had managed to track them down. A battle ensued, leading to the death of four of House Dlardrageths members. The High Mages used stasis magic to seal the rest of the survivors within these caves. \nIn the , the Eaerlanni elves founded the fortress town of Ascals Horn, which would later come to be known as Hellgate Keep, from which the peaks name was eventually derived. Though some claimed that the peak was already named Ascals Horn prior to this and that the settlement had derived its name from the peak itself.\nCenturies later in the , the Mistmaster used the power of the artifact known as the Gatekeepers Crystal to destroy Hellgate Keep both above and below ground, unleashing such severe destruction upon Ascals Horn that a massive ravine was left in its wake and a second rift opened along the outcrop upon which the Keep was once perched. The ravine later became known as Grintharkes Gulch, a name that was coined by a bard for the sake of alliteration, while the rift became known as Razorthorn Rift and was one of the first places tended to by the treants of Turlang that quickly came to inhabit the area.\nAround the spring and summer of 1370 DR, the treants planted trees along the cliff in hopes of breaking up its rocks and further eroding it.\nIn 1374 DR, the forces of Turlang and the Druids of Tall Trees were still working together towards reforesting the area. The druids were known to be providing them assistance in the form of magic, protection, and the nurturing of new tree spouts.\nAscals Horn laid along a bend in the Ascal Stream, later known as Skull Stream, the westernmost source river of the more prominent Delimbiyr River.\nFollowing 1369 DR, much of the cliff was taken up by the central, inverted-pyramid shaped ravine known as Grintharkes Gulch. At the time the gorge measured  long on each side and around  deep.Its stated in the Hellgate Keep adventures epilogue that the gulch was later widened, thus it stands to reason that these given measurements may no longer be accurate following 1370 DR. The primary means of entering the gulch was Razorthorn Rift, which ran along the southern outcrop upon that Hellgate Keep was once perched. However, the area was blocked off to outsiders by the treants with sharp patches of brier and thorn that stood  tall and stretched on across  of land."
