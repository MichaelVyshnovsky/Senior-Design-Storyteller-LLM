        "mainbody": "The '''Earthfast Mountains''', or simply the '''Earthfasts''', were a small mountain range in [[north Faerûn]], running from the [[Dragon Reach]] in the west, through the [[Vast]] and into [[Impiltur]] in the east. It was an arm of the greater [[Earthspur Mountains]] to the north.",
        "Geographical features": "Despite being somewhat smaller than the Earthspur Mountains, the Earthfast Mountains were jagged and only slightly less harsh, and just as hard to cross or climb. The mountains had rocky peaks and steep slopes, and were separated by abrupt gorges.\n\nFortunately, a few passes permitted traffic through the range, connecting the north and south parts of the Vast. In the west, the [[High Trail]] ran through [[Elvenblood Pass]], and in the east, the [[North Road]] ran through [[Glorming Pass]].Though only these two major passes are stated to exist, many maps depict an unexplained large gap in the range east of the Glorming Pass.\n\nOne famous but hidden peak in the Earthfasts was [[Iron Dragon Mountain]]. The [[Hill of Tombs]] was the southernmost point of the mountain range, lying in Impiltur near the coast of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The [[Fire River]] originated in these mountains and flowed west through the Vast into the Dragon Reach. Near the source of the Fire River, a cavern in the foothills of the Earthfast Mountains held tunnels that led into the local [[Underdark]], in the area called the [[Deep Wastes]].\n\n[[Image:Fang in the Forest.jpg|thumb|left|The Fang in the Forest mountain.]]\nAnother well-known mountain was the [[Fang in the Forest]] in the southernmost end of the range. It was a conical-shaped peak and thought to be an extinct volcano.[[Ed Greenwood]]. \"Eye on the Realms:  The Dragon That Never Died.\" ''[[Dragon magazine|Dragon]] '' #424. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, June, 2013.\n\nThere were deposits of [[iron]], [[silver]], and [[copper]] ores to be found within the Earthfast Mountains.",
        "Locations": "Perhaps the most important site in the Earthfast Mountains was the [[Master's Library]] on Iron Dragon Mountain. It was one of the greatest temples to [[Deneir]] in Faerûn and home to the largest library in the world. Its true location was hidden, however, but the [[Reading Room]] fortified temple that supported it lay some distance to the south.\n\nThe besieged [[dwarf|dwarven]] city of the same name, [[Earthfast]], was situated in a high mountain valley of the Earthfast Mountains.{{cite book/Dwarves Deep|61–62}}\n\n[[Malanthus Stormstaern]], a [[Magister]], once possessed a keep hidden in the Earthfast Mountains, somewhere near the headwaters of the Fire River. This was thought to be buried in an avalanche and lost to explorers.\n\nThere were two small settlements in the western Earthfasts, [[High Haspur]] and [[Sarbreenar]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The highest peaks of the Earthfast Mountains were dominated by various avian creatures, including [[giant eagle]]s. Their depths, meanwhile, were occupied by large populations of [[orc]]s and [[ogre]]s. Finally, [[drow]] could be found within and beneath the mountains.\n\nThere were barbarians dwelling in the Earthfast Mountains. One [[god]] their [[cleric]]s worshiped was [[Isakkhu]], a mountain god.\n\n[[Shield dwarf|Shield dwarves]] also dwelled in the Earthfast Mountains, particularly around the besieged city of the same name, Earthfast.\n\nThe Master's Library temple of Deneir was home to Deneirrath priests, particularly the High Librarians of the clergy, but all devout followers of Deneir were expected to make at least one pilgrimage to here. The Deneirrath were aided and defended by eight full-grown [[mist dragon]]s who laired in nearby peaks. Ouranalathra the \"Mistmaiden\", a legendary mist dragon, also once laired here at Iron Dragon Mountain.\n\nThe [[Rocktappers]] were a loose association of prospectors, trappers, and hermits who roamed the Earthfasts.{{cite book/The Bloodstone Lands|56}}\n\nThe Fang in the Forest mountain was home to the [[green dragon]] [[Aglaraerose]], from the late 14th century onwards.",
        "History": "The Magister Malanthus Stormstaern occasionally operated from a hidden keep in the Earthfast Mountains during his reign, from [[154 DR]] to [[177 DR]].\n\nThe famous mist dragon Ouranalathra the \"Mistmaiden\" once kept a lair in the range, from which she battled several other dragons during [[231 DR|the Year of the Mist Dragon, 231 DR]]. The mountain where she laired later became known as Iron Dragon Mountain, and after she left it became the site of the Master's Library.\n\nDwarves of the Earthfast Mountains joined the armies of [[War-Captain]] [[Imphras Heltharn]] of [[Lyrabar]] to battle a hobgoblin horde in the [[High Pass]] of the Earthspur Mountains.\n\nAlthough mines in the Earthfasts produced moderate quantities of iron and silver, they proved to be insufficient against the poor environmental conditions and hardships faced by the miners. By [[1359 DR]], a few dozen lone and stubborn prospectors were scouring the range, with many more at it by [[1372 DR]]. These included members of the Rocktappers.\n\nIn [[1357 DR|the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], the [[Harper]] [[bard]] [[Mestrel Hawkmantle]] pursued fleeing brigands east up the Fire River towards their hide-out, only to see them captured by slavers instead. He followed them to a cavern in the foothills of the Earthfast Mountains, where he soon found about fifty slaves being traded to drow emerging from the Underdark. Mestrel attacked the drow and the slavers, and freed their captives, leading them out again."
