        "mainbody": "Mount Olympus was an enormous cross-planar mountain that connected the Prime Material plane with the Outer Planes that were important to the Greek pantheon via the Astral Plane.\nIn the region of Arvandor within sight of the mountain, Mount Olympus was the most prominent feature of the landscape, rising above the rest of the plane. It was believed by the Fraternity of Order that visibility from the mountains peak could extend as far as  in any direction. Travelers claimed that even the other two layers of Arborea, Aquallor and Mithardir, could sometimes be seen from the summit.\nThe slopes of Olympus had a rich landscape of woods and rocky terrain. The southern slope of the mountain was a pastoral region with olive groves, vineyards, apple and orange orchards, and sheep grazing areas. It was considered the easiest ascent route. Some of the caverns under the mountain were beautiful, filled with colorful lichen and lit by luminescent rock. The caverns sometimes opened into enormous chambers that defied perception and did not seem at all like an underground environment. Other caverns were damp and small, littered with bones and permeated by rotting smells.\nright|thumb|270px|The planar connections of Mount Olympus (left) and Yggdrasil (right).\nThe slopes of Mount Olympus were rooted in the divine realm of Olympus in the first layer of Arborea. It was the most prominent feature of the realm. At its base, twisting caverns cut through the stone at the veins of the mountain into the Lower planes of Carceri, Gehenna, and Hades. However, unlike the World Ash, the portals to and from Mount Olympus were well mapped and did not shift over time.\nMount Olympus connected to multiple worlds in the Prime Material plane, which were accessible via hidden paths along the mountain. On Toril, the mountain was located on the island of Achea, which lay several hundred miles from Faer√ªn. In order to reach Arborea, travelers needed to climb the mountain to the very summit. The Torilian manifestation of Mount Olympus had an elevation of .\nThe World Serpent Inn also provided a connection to Mount Olympus and regularly manifested near the slopes of the mountain in Arvandor. Travelers could enter the plane and access the mountain via the inn, but anyone who entered Arborea from the realm of Olympus could only see or access the inn after receiving express authorization from the Greek pantheon.\nAlthough all the portals leading to and from Mount Olympus were open to anyone trying to cross them, many of the secret paths leading to other planes from the mountain were guarded by creatures in the employ of the Olympian deities. Some of those pahs were only accessible to worshipers of particular deities, while anyone else trying to use them was instead redirected to Hades.\nMount Olympus was the home of most deities of the Greek pantheon, who held vast halls and temples on its slopes.\nThe mountain was primarily inhabited by nymphs, satyrs, and sylphs. The caverns of Mount Olympus were inhabited by bacchae, oreads, and satyrs, among others.\n* A temple of Hermes that stood within The Ladys Ward of Sigil was rumored to have a portal that connected the city to Mount Olympus.\n* The entrances to the homes of the Olympian powers were all well disguised. Some believed that this was the doing of Hephaestus, others Hermes, and some believed it was the doing of Pan."
