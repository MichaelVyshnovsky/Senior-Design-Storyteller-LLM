        "Geography": "The icy mountains of the Saas towered over the lands of the Great Glacier. They rose to elevations of thousands of feet above sea level. At their narrowest parts, each range was many miles wide.\n\nThree separate ranges composed the Saas, the [[Tuutsaas Chain]] in the west, the [[Lugsaas Chain]] in the south, and the [[Angsaas Chain]] in the east.\n\nMost of the mountains of the Saas&mdash;as was the case with the other mountain ranges of the Glacier&mdash;were made of nearly solid ice, formed during the creation of the Glacier.\n\nThe Saas had few passes&mdash;most would only be attempted by risk-taking explorers.",
        "Flora & Fauna": "[[Remorhaz]] lived in all three of the Saas in great numbers, in tunnels below the mountains. Some thus considered them the \"gatekeepers\" of the Great Glacier."
