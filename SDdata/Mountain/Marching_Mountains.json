        "mainbody": "The '''Marching Mountains''' were a heavily forested mountain range on the northern border of [[Calimshan]]. In far ancient times, the range was known as the '''Dragons' Wall'''.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "[[File:Marching Mountains bg2.png|thumb|''An up-close look at the Marching Mountains.''|340x340px]]\nThe mountains were surrounded by foothills, and these southern hills were the site of many manors; due to the cooler temperatures at higher elevation, rich [[Calishite]]s would rest here during the hot summers.{{Cite dungeon/34/On Wings of Darkness|54}}\n\nThe tallest mountain in the range ([[Mount Gommat]]) was 8,500 feet, while the average was just below a mile. The taller peaks, (all those above 6,500 feet,) were in the interior of the range, and the lower mountains were broad. The variation in elevations was wide, so the Marching Mountains were full of many hidden valleys and ravines.\n\nThe mountains contained iron of a particularly dark hue, and this was used to craft ''[[shoonring]]s'' with combat or defensive properties.\n\nIn the winter, snow would cover the tops of the higher mountains, but only exceedingly rarely would the snow ever reach below 6,600 feet.\n\nThe [[Calim River]], [[River Agis]], and [[Bakkal's Creek]] and the [[Two Falls River]], which merged together to form the [[River of Ice]], were all fed by melting snows from the Marching Mountains.",
            "Flora and Fauna": "Except for within 1,300 feet of the summit of Mount Gommat, the range was entirely covered in [[Wikipedia:en:Conifer|conifers]] from the [[Forest of Mir]].\n\nThe Marching Mountains were home to a wide variety and high populations of birds of prey. Of note among such birds was the [[hawk|green kestrel]], a hawk only found in these mountains and prized by Calishite falconers.\n\nWyverns lived in the mountains and would prey upon the herds of mountain goats also present there.\n\nPegasi of chestnut coloring were once extant in the mountains but were hunted to extinction during the [[Shoon Imperium|Shoon era]]."
        },
        "Trade and Travel": "The remains of ancient [[Dwarf|dwarven]] bridges from the days of [[Shanatar]] still existed as late as the fourteenth century [[DR]] from where they used to cross the treacherous ravines, but the only passage across such places in later times required paying tolls to the [[ogre]]s who guarded rope bridges. To descend into the valleys and bypass the toll bridges was to risk landslides, monsters, or getting lost.\n\nHigh winds made most travel by air over the peaks dangerous.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], the [[Twisted Rune]] had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.",
        "History": "The Marching Mountains received their current name around {{Yearlink|-5960}}, when the [[Axemarch Stone]] was dedicated at the founding of [[High Shanatar]] and dwarves marched into the plains north of the mountains in what later became the kingdom of Tethyr.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Some folk claimed that pegasi still lived in small numbers in the Marching Mountains, yet most folk dismissed this view.\n\nA story was told that on one of the easternmost foothills of the Marching Mountains, called [[Argentor]], King [[Strohm III]] of Tethyr and his general fought an army of [[drow]] in the eight century DR. Supposedly, the two by themselves slew 5,000 drow during a [[Wikipedia:en:Solar eclipse|solar eclipse]] that lasted two days.\n\nRumored to be the children of the gods, perhaps the most legendary tales of the Marching Mountains revolve around the [[Abbalaya]]r, a human tribe who had gained innate powers of [[divination]]. If one could find their hidden city of [[Ul'sahab]], one would find peace, love, and infinite knowledge.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], a rumor began spreading about an enormous [[aurumvorax]] the size of a [[dragon]] in the area around [[Ruler's Ridge]].\n\nIt was also rumored that the [[Duergar]] had built a large complex in the mountains, which had since been abandoned.",

                "Second Necropolis of Nykkar": "By the fourteenth century DR, the ruins of four temples were all that remained of this former burial site for rulers of Calimshan in the southeastern foothills.

The \"City of Sorrow\" was located in the south-central hills.",
                "Ul'sahab": "\"The City of Seers\", or \"the City of Oracles\", was a mystical, magical city on the summit of Mount Abbalayat and was the home of the Abbalayar. It was invisible to all but the Abbalayar."

These frequently moving communities would keep in touch with each other through use of messenger pigeons.\n\nWhile not as legendary as commonly believed, the Abbalayar did in fact live on the holy mountain of Mount Abbalayat, though only they knew the secret way into their city.",
