'''Mount Pojah''' was a mountain somewhere in [[Tabot]] near the [[Shou Lung]] border.<ref group="note">Mount Pojah is not labelled on any map, but likely lies at the eastern end of the [[Kun-Yen Shan]] range, as it is the only one with a hermitage marked near the Shou Lung border.

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, a tortoise-shell divination at [[U'Chan Gompa]] promised the finding of a very rich [[gold]] mine east of Mount Pojah.

==Notable Inhabitants==
It was the home of [[the Forgotten One]], a hermit and oracle, around 2607.
