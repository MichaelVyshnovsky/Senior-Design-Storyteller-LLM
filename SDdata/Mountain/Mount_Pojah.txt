Mount Pojah was a mountain somewhere in Tabot near the Shou Lung border.Mount Pojah is not labelled on any map, but likely lies at the eastern end of the Kun-Yen Shan range, as it is the only one with a hermitage marked near the Shou Lung border.
In , a tortoise-shell divination at UChan Gompa promised the finding of a very rich gold mine east of Mount Pojah.
It was the home of the Forgotten One, a hermit and oracle, around 2607.
