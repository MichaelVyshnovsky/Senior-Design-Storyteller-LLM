        "mainbody": "The '''Po Yul Dzayul Range''' was a mountain range in [[Tabot]] in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Geography": "The Po Yul Dzayul Range was the middle of the three arms of the [[Yehimal]] that extended east into Kara-Tur. It bisected the high plateau of Tabot. Branching off from the south side was the [[Haraki Ridge]].",
        "Locations": "Two significant mountains in the Po Yul Dzayul Range were [[Mount Shun]] and [[Mount E'kwong]].",
        "Description": "The Po Yul Dzayul Range appeared black from a distance, and peaks forbidding. Mount Shun was craggy and described as \"mysterious\", while Mount E'kwong was jagged, foreboding, and grim. High altitudes and the prevailing winds kept the glaciers frozen.",
        "Legends": "By [[1357 DR]], a blind beggar in the city of [[Rokstang]], Tabot, was telling a tale of how he and some companions once ventured into the Po Yul Dzayul Range and discovered a lost mine stuffed with [[diamond]]s and other [[gem]]s. However, the explorers were attacked by a wrathful spirit that slew all but the beggar. Left blinded by the spirit (or perhaps by the sun), he wandered lost on a glacier for days until he was discovered and taken to Rokstang, where he survived as a beggar."
