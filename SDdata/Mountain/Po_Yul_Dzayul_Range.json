        "mainbody": "he Po Yul Dzayul Range was a mountain range in Tabot in Kara-Tur. \nThe Po Yul Dzayul Range was the middle of the three arms of the Yehimal that extended east into Kara-Tur. It bisected the high plateau of Tabot. Branching off from the south side was the Haraki Ridge.\nTwo significant mountains in the Po Yul Dzayul Range were Mount Shun and Mount Ekwong.\nThe Po Yul Dzayul Range appeared black from a distance, and peaks forbidding. Mount Shun was craggy and described as \"mysterious\", while Mount Ekwong was jagged, foreboding, and grim. High altitudes and the prevailing winds kept the glaciers frozen. \nBy 1357 DR, a blind beggar in the city of Rokstang, Tabot, was telling a tale of how he and some companions once ventured into the Po Yul Dzayul Range and discovered a lost mine stuffed with diamonds and other gems. However, the explorers were attacked by a wrathful spirit that slew all but the beggar. Left blinded by the spirit (or perhaps by the sun), he wandered lost on a glacier for days until he was discovered and taken to Rokstang, where he survived as a beggar."
