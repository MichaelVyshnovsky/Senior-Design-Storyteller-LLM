        "mainbody": "Kelvins Cairn was a mountain in Icewind Dale. \nKelvins Cairn was a free-standing  mountain fronted by a river valley about as deep as the mountain was high. The mountain top remained covered in snow year-round. The mountain was the only peak within a thousand square miles, even though it appeared as merely a pile of loose boulders.\nStretching south-south-west for several miles from the south face of the Cairn is a deep trench known locally as the Dwarven Valley. It consisted mostly of underground mining tunnels and relatively austere living quarters made from expended mining tunnels.\nBruenors Climb was a  column of stone that offered a vantage point over Termalaine and Maer Dualdon.\nThe spot where Aegis-fang was forged was tucked up against the southern flank of the mountains base at the northernmost point of the valley.\nThe main method of ingress to the valley was a natural switchback at the base of the Cairns southern face. It was also used by the dwarves as a choke-point against attacks from marauding orcs or reghedmen.\nAbove the Dwarven Valley on the south face of the Cairn was a covered cave entrance that was once an outpost for the dwarves but had since been overrun. Orcs, bandits and giants have used the cave as a fortified lair over the years, but it was known among the Ten Towns as the Verbeeg Lair after a famous battle with Biggrins verbeeg who were using it as a lair in 1356 DR.\nReghedmen legend held that Tempos defeated the frost giant Kelvin in this spot and gouged out the rocks here and piled them on top of his corpse. Many mining tunnels in the Dwarven Valley had to be collapsed when the army of Akar Kessel attacked in 1356 DR and it was atop the Cairn that Akar Kessel conjured up fiery magic with Crenshinibon, subsequently melting the ice and snow around him, which caused an avalanche. Most of the Dwarven Valley was abandoned when the location of Mithral Hall was rediscovered but some of the dwarves whod left for the Hall returned to their homes beneath the Cairn.\nOver a century later, in 1484 DR, the corpse of Akar Kessell was discovered upon the Cairns summit by an expedition from Luskan. It had been transformed into a wight and came to live in some of the deeper mines beneath the Valley. Kessells wight helped a dwarven stone-carver named Baerick Hammerstone to distribute black ice, which corrupted those who touched it, altering their behavior to be more evil. This resulted in a divide forming between the dwarves living in the Valley and Kessell himself raised many zombies to harry those dwarves who werent corrupted. Eventually, Kessell was driven off by adventurers but shortly afterward, the Valley was invaded by a drow force led by Tiago Baenre.\nThe Dwarven Valley was of course home to dwarves. Specifically, dwarves of Clan Battlehammer, formerly led by Bruenor Battlehammer and by 1483 DR by Stokely Silverstream. From underneath this vale, the dwarves mined iron and forged it into well-crafted weapons and armor that were then sold in Bryn Shander, located at the other end of the valley.\nDrizzt DoUrden, upon arriving in Icewind Dale, was told by Cassius to go to Kelvins Cairn. He set up his sparse home in a cave on the mountains barren north face.\nWild beasts were often found on and around the mountain, including verbeeg, yetis and Remorhaz. Verbeeg were especially fond of making their dens in the rocky cliff faces."
