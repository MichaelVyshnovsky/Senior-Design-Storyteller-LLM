The '''Keryjek Ridge''' was a mountain range within the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
The Keryjek Ridge was the longest mountain range in the Great Glacier. It began near the [[Lugsaas Chain]] and ran north through the interior of the Great Glacier, forming a natural barrier between the [[Alpuk]] and [[Angalpuk]] regions. Its mountains were tall, usually {{SIrange|8000|10000|ft|long=yes}} in height with some peaks reaching {{SI|15000|ft|long=yes}}.

The Keryjek Ridge was considered the most beautiful sight in the Great Glacier. Due to [[fairy ice]] deposits, the tallest peaks glimmered like rainbows. Its valleys were filled with clean frozen lakes and lush evergreens circled the mountainsides.
