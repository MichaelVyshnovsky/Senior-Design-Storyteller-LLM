'''Mount Or-Ghash''' was a peak in the northern [[Chigidi Mountains]] in the [[Plain of Horses]] region of northwestern [[Kara-Tur]]. Its western slope was a holy place to local [[lama]]s and the body of [[Or-Ghash Gol]], who was considered to be the greatest high lama to have ever lived in the area, was interred nearby.

==Description==
As a memorial to Or-Ghash Gol, one hundred caskets were placed along the pass to the mountain, approximately {{SI|100|yard|long=yes}} apart. Only one casket held Gol's remains, but which it was was a secret known only to the high lamas dwelling on Mount Or-Ghash.

==Activities==
The mountain was visited often by lamas and [[pilgrim]]s. It was expected that pilgrims make an offering such as a [[scarf]] (''khtagh'' in [[Chuchian]]) on top of every casket. Strangely, each spring, the high lamas placed a new set of clothes in the true casket of Or-Ghash Gol, and each autumn they took them out again, finding them used, dirtied, and torn.

==Inhabitants==
The high lama of Mount Or-Ghash was [[Torgoja P'a]], who served for ten years as of {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.
