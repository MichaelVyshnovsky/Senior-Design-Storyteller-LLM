The town of Vineshade was located there. The Purple Hills was a lush and fertile land of green farmlands overlooking the Sea of Swords.
The coastal area of the Purple Hills was called the Purple Cliffs – a virtually deserted land as it was not suitable for farming. The local hin were also terrified of large bodies of water and naval vessels. This fear contributed to the Purple Cliffs remaining uninhabited, rising  above sea level near Fortress Faithful to as high as 200 feet near the center of the cliffs. The coastline was so named due to an abundance of creeping, purple flowers that hung over its edge, and the rich quartz deposits found throughout the rocks. These flowers and mineral deposits gave the area its name. The southern edge of the hills was formed by the Red River, a tributary of the River Ith.
As halflings were not allowed in Tethyrean government, the numerous communities of the Purple Hills assembled their own government – the Purple Hills Council that maintained close relations to the governments of Myratma and Zazesspur. Halflings of Purple Hills were sure to receive aid from both Myratma and Zazesspur, thanks to their friendly relations rooted in trade. Minor dangers such as rampaging ankhegs were known to on occasions arise in the region. The Count of county Vintor in the late 14 century was a dwarfish hin Fleet Chancellor named Krimmon Amethystall who lived alongside the Purple Cliffs.
The farmlands on the hills produced cattle like sheep and wool that were produced in quality fabrics in Tethyr, as well as various fruits, vegetables, and other foodstuffs that fed the city of Zazesspur in the north and Myratma in the south. Some of the fruits of the Purple Hills included gooseberries, plums, blackberries, One such farm belonged to Oraundas Haeltower, a producer of cheap, smooth wine from vineyards north and east of Vineshade. During a sale of such wines in 1479 DR, treasure and other valuables began appearing in the wines. This was discovered to be a smuggling operation from the families of Amn. The regions hin population was known to produce Tintorams Select, a blackberry brandy. Other libations of note produced in the Purple Hills were Farlindell Red wine and Purple Hills Cider from the Kraljaom Distillery.
Circa the , a slave rebel named Ankar led an army of fellow escapees from Calimshan into the Purple Hills, where they were safe from their masters. The human slaves eventually continued moving north, past the Purple Hills, towards the Dragons Neck Peninsula. By the , Zazesspur was rebuilt into an outpost of the decaying Calishite empire, keeping the Purple Hills as its territory. By the , the Purple Hills were claimed by Tethyr as Clan Bormul completed Ithalyr on the Purple Cliffs. This became the first royal palace of Tethyr.
Purple Hills was home to a population of Arvoreen-worshiping halfling farmers who were forced out of their homes in the . The hin migrants ended up forming the realm of Meiritin. Centuries later, during Tethyrs Interregnum, Arvoreens Marchers – gnomes and halflings of the Purple Hills, led by Estemal Talltankard, were responsible for keeping the region from being consumed by anarchy.
In the , the village of Geniste was swiftly destroyed within mere hours by a flood green slimes that spilled out of a root cellar. In five hours, the oozes devoured the village and its inhabitants completely, leaving only a wandering priest, his paladin companion, and several villagers alive. The village became a swamp surrounding a cemetery on a hilltop. It was revealed that the slimed emerged from what later would be known as the Gravegate of Geniste, a one-way gate from Undermountain.
