The Landrise was a large, sprawling cliff that speared through the middle of the Shaar, effectively cutting the region into two halves.
The Landrise originated in the north on the eastern edge of the Firesteap Mountains. It stretched southward through the plains of the Shaar for many hundreds of miles, curving both east and west along the way. The River Shaar cascaded down the Landrise near the Great Rift and Traders Way crossed the Landrise south of the river. The Landrise leveled-out within the Forest of Amtar near Dambrath.
