The '''Landrise''' was a large, sprawling cliff that speared through the middle of the [[Shaar]], effectively cutting the region into two halves.

==Geography==
The Landrise originated in the north on the eastern edge of the [[Firesteap Mountains]]. It stretched southward through the plains of the Shaar for many hundreds of miles, curving both east and west along the way. The [[River Shaar]] cascaded down the Landrise near the [[Great Rift]] and [[Trader's Way]] crossed the Landrise south of the river. The Landrise leveled-out within the [[Forest of Amtar]] near [[Dambrath]].

==Notable Locations==
