The Sanrach Mountains were the dominant geographical feature within Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
The Sanrach Mountains isolated Samarach from Thindol in the east and Chult in the west. They fully encircled Samarach and the Sanrach Basin, stretching for hundreds of miles along the western, eastern, and northern border. Several passes, including Sorlmar Pass and Narubel Pass, allowed passage through the mountains. The mountains also served to halt the jungles of Chult from pressing further east.
The heavily forested eastern slopes of the western arm of the Sanrach Mountains supported populations of blood apes and cloaked apes.
