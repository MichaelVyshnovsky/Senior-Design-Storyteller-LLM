The Griffon Mountains were a small mountain range located in the Durpar.
This mountain range rested between the Scarlet Jungle and the River Hiedar.
Though the surrounding countryside was extremely rocky, the peaks of the Griffon Mountians were not that high.
Flocks of griffons lived in and around the mountain range. Many native Durparians made a living hunting or capturing the griffons.
