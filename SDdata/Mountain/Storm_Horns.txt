The '''Storm Horns''', also referred to as the '''Stormhorns''' or '''Storm Horn Mountains''', was the name given to the mountains that marked the western and northern frontier of [[Cormyr]] in the [[Eastern Heartlands]]. They were wild and untamed peaks, the cliffs and crags of which were teeming with a wide variety of monsters.

==Description==
The Storm Horns were among the tallest and steepest mountains in [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]], composed of hardened rock that was more difficult than most to break through. They were exceptionally difficult to traverse and those attempting a trek across the jagged terrain were in for a grueling trip. 

The highest of the Storm Horns' peaks stood far above the others, piercing the clouds in the sky. While it was a stunning view to behold, the treacherousness of the mountainside made it one best appreciated from afar.

===Climate===
As its name suggested, the Storm Horns were battered with horrific thunderstorms all year round. The eastern slopes of the mountains were battered with most of the rain as wind nearly always blew westward, and the highest peaks received snowfall much of the year save for summer. 

==Geography==
The mountains formed the northwest border of Cormyr, segregating the Forest Nation from the desert of [[Anauroch]] in [[north Faerûn]].

Only two pathways wound through the range, [[High Horn Pass]] and [[Gnoll Pass]], both of which were defended by Cormyr.

===Flora & Fauna===
The majority of plant life found in the Storm Horns grew along its eastern slopes. [[Turis]] trees could be found at the upper end of the treeline, along with the ubiquitous [[Bowen's flower]], and [[bentilan]] spice. [[Maxor]] plants could be found to the south, only near the [[Tun River]]. 

A wide variety of mammalian animals made their home throughout the Storm Horns, including [[deer]], [[bear]]s, [[mountain lion]]s, [[wolves]], and the rather uncommon [[serow]]. Some of the more monstrous or fantastic beasts found within included [[kobold]]s,  [[aurumvorax]]es, [[roc]]s, [[minotaur lizard]]s, and in the deepest of its caves, the vicious [[chimera]]e.

==History==
These mountains were once home to several strongholds of an ancient [[goblin]] empire. The empire fell to [[dwarven]] attacks, long before humans appeared in [[Cormyr]].

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tribes of the Storm Horns occasionally launched raids, although some had learned to trade peacefully. both [[Eagle Peak]] and [[Skull Crag]] remained standing and populated the [[1372 DR|year after the war's end]].

When the extra-dimensional city of [[Grodd]] was drawn closer to the [[Prime Material Plane]] around that same time, ''[[portal]]s'' to the city began to form within the range.

==Rumors & Legends==
Due to their majestic size the mountains inspired numerous writers to recount their grandeur in poetic verse.

''Circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century DR, there was a false rumor that scores of [[drow]], [[lich]]es, and [[beholder]]s came up from the Storm Horns and surrounding areas.

==Notable locations==

* [[Tyrluk]], the village situated at the base of the mountains.

==Inhabitants==
The peaks were inhabited by [[dragon]]s and tribes of [[humanoid]]s, and some [[orc]] survivors of the attack on [[Arabel]] made their home in the eastern Storm Horns and the flatlands beneath.

[[Aarakocra]] made their home in the Storm Horns in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries DR.{{cite book/Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faerûn|11}}{{Cite document/Elemental Evil Player's Companion|4}}

Monstrous humanoids such as [[bugbear]]s, and [[orc]]s and among its tallest peaks, [[cloud giant|cloud]] Even the malevolent [[fomorian]] gains were known to lair deep within abandoned mines.

Like the nearby Thunder Peak Mountains, the ecology of the Storm Horns was strongly connected to its population of [[dragon]]s.
