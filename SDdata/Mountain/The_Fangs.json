        "mainbody": "The Fangs were a pair of extremely steep mountains between which—at Fang Pass—the Trade Way led on the way through the Cloud Peaks of Amn to the Sword Coast.\nThese two crags were not among the tallest in the range, yet they were the most difficult mountains to climb in the Cloud Peaks because of their treacherously steep slopes and the ice sheets covering them. The area was home to unusually harsh cold weather, with the passes regularly blocked by blizzards during winter that completely isolated Nashkel from the rest of the realm.\nThe two peaks marked the northern border of Amn at the point where the Trade Way (here called the Bitten Road) crossed directly between them. At this location there was placed a marker stone that read, \"Fang Pass Border of Amn\". (Interestingly enough, the Amnian town of Nashkel actually lay farther north than this point.)\nFang Pass was the main route by land between Amn and the settlements of the Western Heartlands, such as Baldurs Gate and Beregost. The lesser-known pass of the Neck lay many miles to the the east, overseen by Citadel Amnur, and the next available land route involved passing over the Ridge even further to the east.\nFrost giants used to inhabit the area until the , when they were destroyed by the forces of the Shoon Imperium.\nIn the 1350s DR, a remorhaz was slain in Fang Pass. A large number of adventurers were then slain or went missing searching for its lair. It was thought that the remorhaz had a mate or family still alive however, no tracks were found and bodies were always stripped of loot, so Lord Aernos Krimmevol of Crimmor hired adventurers to investigate, though without success.\nThe Shoon artifact Ghazir the Deserts Edge was regularly blamed for the bad weather of the Cloud Peaks, and specifically for the blizzards of Fang Pass. These rumors were actually true, as the blade had bound the ghosts of dozens of frost giants that continued to plague the mountains with cold weather."
