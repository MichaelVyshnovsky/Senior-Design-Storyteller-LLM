Mount Kus was located in the Hordelands near the Katakoro Shan range.
Situated on the western bank of the Jumpa River, Mount Kus stood above the city of Kushk where the Great Chain Bridge of Ra-Khati met the Old Iron Road.
The temple Bimasara, called the Holy Mountain of Kus, was built within Mount Kus and atop its peak in the form of the Tower of Harmony.
As of the mid 14 century DR, only gaki inhabited the mountain.
