        "mainbody": "Swordpoint, or The Swordpoint, was a huge needle-shaped mountain in the Anauroch desert.\nThe tall Swordpoint mountain was far taller than any of the other peaks in its range. It was even far taller than the neighbouring mountains of the Plain of Standing Stones, such as those of the Snout Mountains and those close to the Dark Bones Rift. Around the base of the mountain were several water-filled sinkholes.\nIn the 14 century DR, manticores were known to live around the mountain, drinking at its many natural wells."
