        "mainbody": "The Rauvin Mountains were a small mountain range located in the Silver Marches of Northwest Faer√ªn.\nThe Rauvins were located south of the Cold Wood and north of the larger Nether Mountains range.The Rauvins formed the southern border of Cold Vale and Adbar Run and the northern border of the Sundabar Vale. The River Rauvin was widely believed to begin at Rainbow Gorge in the Rauvin Mountains (although in truth it began far to the north in the Cold Wood and traveled underground in the Rauvinheart caverns before appearing aboveground at Rainbow Gorge).\nThe Rauvins spanned a range of  east-to-west and  north-to south. The mountains themselves were purple-hued and rose between  and  above the valley floor.\nThe northern side of the Rauvins were inhabited primarily by three orc tribes the Heart Takers, Red Fangs, and Tornskulls, named after various rituals to Gruumsh. Bugbears, ogres, and several varieties of giants (hill, cloud, frost) also dwelt in the mountains.\nA number of dragons roamed the Rauvins and the neighboring Nether Mountains, namely fang dragons and white dragons (the most likely to be seen), blues, coppers,  golds, reds, silvers, and the occasional dracolich.\nThe mountains were home to bears, wolves, ghost rothe, and giant eagles. Other inhabitants included dire boars, dire bears, dire wolves, ettins, worgs, and wyverns.\n* Mount Jaws\n* Mount Tolzrin\n* Faerangs Doom\n* Mount Gaeram\n* Dead Orc Pass\n* Rainbow Gorge\n* Rauvinheart caverns\n* Chalarstaukh caverns\n* Citadel Felbarr\n* Chalarstaukh\n* Malauth\n* Vaerluth\n* Newfort\n* Mooshies Grove"
