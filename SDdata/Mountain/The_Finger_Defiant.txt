'''The Finger Defiant''' was a mesa in southern [[Mulhorand]], excavated by the [[dwarf]] [[geomancer]] [[Thormud Horn]] over long years. He used to call it simply "the mesa", until he took [[Kiril Duskmourn]] as his bodyguard; she insisted on the name until he took it up too. The mesa contained storerooms, libraries, halls, galleries, and even balconies. There was an exposed spiral staircase outside the mesa.{{cite book/Darkvision|32-34|4}}
