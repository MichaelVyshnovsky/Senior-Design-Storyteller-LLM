        "mainbody": "undars Hill was a prominent peak found among the Dessarin Hills in the Savage Frontier.The location of Jundars Hill is established on the map included in The North Guide to the Savage Frontier as being in the Dessarin Hills, near Triboar. This location is confirmed three times in the novel Thornhold. However, in The North, on page 49 of \"The Wilderness\", the heading \"Jundars Hill\" is accidentally inserted into the entry for Ironfordâ€”it discusses a ford over the River Dessarin, not a hill, and mentions the Bargewright Inn, which otherwise established to be located at Ironford. No information is provided for Jundars Hill in the text of The North, so this entry must be disregarded as a misprint.\nIt stood a short ride south from the road between Triboar and Yartar. It loomed above Jundars Vale, a small valley that contained the ruins of a village in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nJundars Vale was once the site of a small and sheltered village, before it was attacked and destroyed by Zhentarim soldiers in the late 1340s DR. The child Dag Zoreth was stolen from the village and raised amongst them.\nMore than twenty years later, on Mirtul 5 of the , Dag Zoreth, now a member of the Zhentarim himself a priest of Cyric, visited the ruins of his home to recall his tragic past."
