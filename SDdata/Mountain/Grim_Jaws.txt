The '''Grim Jaws''' were a collection of four peaks over a mile high in the western [[Starspire Mountains]] in [[Tethyr]]. They were the tallest mountains in the Starspires.

==Geography==
Each of the four mountains was over 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) above sea level. They stood to the east of the [[Trade Way]] and north of [[Zazesspur]] The high valley between three of the Jaws was known as [[Three Peaks Vale]].

==Inhabitants==
The lower slopes and upper mountain vales of the Grim Jaws were populated by [[ogre]]s and [[gnoll]]s.

''Circa'' [[1250 DR]], a stronghold of [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of [[Tyr]] in Three Peaks Vale was destroyed by a horde of ogres, which slaughtered all of Tyr's worshipers.
