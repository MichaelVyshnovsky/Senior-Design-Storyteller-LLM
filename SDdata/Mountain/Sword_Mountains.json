        "Trade": "[[Gold]] and [[Platinum]] were found in the foothills of the Sword Mountains.",
        "History": "After [[Karsus's Folly]] in [[-399 DR]], the leaders of the realm of [[Illefarn]] asked the dragon [[Nolalothcaragascint]] for aid in defeating the [[King of Shadows]], but the dragon was defeated. The force of his body striking the ground created a massive valley within the Sword Mountains. The leaders of Illefarn transformed the dragon's heart into a crystalline floating structure reminiscent of a [[Phylactery]], where the dragon's soul remained for centuries within the fertile valley. <ref name=NWN\">\n\nThe mountains were home to [[orc]]s and [[troll]]s, but after the orcs were united by [[Wund]] and the [[Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge]] in the {{YearlinkName|927}}, the orcs drove the trolls out. This was a contributing factor to the [[Trollwars]].\n\n[[Uruth Ukrypt]]'s orc horde came out of the mountains to attack Waterdeep in the {{YearlinkName|936}}, but they were defeated and forced to retreat.\n\n[[Phandelver's Pact]] was formed circa the 10th century DR by dwarf and gnome clans joined by human spellcasters to bind the magical energies of [[Wave Echo Cave]] into a powerful forge capable of producing magical items, known as the [[Forge of Spells]]. However, in the {{YearlinkName|951}}, Uruth Ukrypt destroyed the nearby town of [[Phandalin]] and sacked Wave Echo Cave, and the location of the Forge was considered lost to history.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, the ancient dragons [[Claugiyliamatar]] and [[Shammagar]] attacked Uruth Ukrypt's food and treasure supplies. Shammagar drove the orcs from Melairren, claiming the stronghold as his new lair.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}\n\nDue to a raid on Ukrypt's crypt by a human adventuring company called the [[Dawnbringer Company]] in the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, the orcs of the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge formed a horde called the [[Broken Bone]] with the intent of destroying Waterdeep. Their plans were once again ruined by a dragon; this time [[Lhammaruntosz]]. Still determined to exact their revenge, the orcs formed another horde, calling it the [[Black Claw]], and in the {{YearlinkName|1026}} they came from the mountains to attack Waterdeep.",
