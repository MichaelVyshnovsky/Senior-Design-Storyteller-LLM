'''The Icepeak''' was a beautiful spire and the highest mountain on the [[Oman's Isle]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. In clear weather, it was visible from the [[Strait of Oman]], aweing ships traveling from [[Callidyrr]] to [[Corwell]].

{{quote|I remember often enough sailing through the strait on the voyages from Callidyrr to Corwell. A few times the weather was clear enough that we could see the mountain. I remember the first time I saw it. Never did I think that any piece of the world could soar so high into the air!|[[Alicia Kendrick]]}}

==Description==
The Icepeak was a picturesque spire located in the [[Grampalt Highlands]] mountain range, amidst its groves, in the south of Oman's Isle. The mountain's summit was covered in snow and ice year-round.

==History==
According to the legends, the Capstone of Oman's Isle â€“ The Icepeak, was claimed to have been the birthplace of the [[giant]] clans and the [[firbolg]]s on the Moonshaes. It was also the ancient home of the [[Forger of Giants]], encased in ice.

In the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, the [[Northmen]] tribes signed the ''[[Treaty of Oman]]'', under the spire of the Icepeak.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, [[Garisa]], the firbolg [[shaman]] wife to [[Klatnaught]], sought to travel to the Capstone of Oman's Isle bearing the ''[[Silverhaft Axe]]'' to free the legendary Forger of Giants from the ice in the mountain's pristine summit.
