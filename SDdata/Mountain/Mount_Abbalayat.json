        "mainbody": "ount Abbalayat was an isolated peak in the western Marching Mountains famous for being the home of the race of oracles called the Abbalayar.\nAbbalayat was an extremely steep mountain, over  tall, with cliffs for lower slopes. It was surrounded by even taller mountains, with a three-mile wide, jagged ravine between.\nThe peak seemed always surrounded by clouds, and dangerous winds rushed through the \"moat\" around the mountain.\nThe mountain itself was filled with caverns. The top of the mountain was the site of the holy city of Ulsahab.\nThe Abbalayar, a race of oracles and prophets lived within the city of Ulsahab, which was magically hidden from sight.\nThe caverns within Mount Abbalayat were used as shelters for the earliest human tribe living in the region. Not even elven scholars knew the name of this lost tribe, but they became the ancestors to the Abbalayar.\nWhen djinn ruled the land that later became Calimshan, they gave the Abbalyar full control of the mountain."
