Fourthpeak was one of the many mountains which rested along the huge range known as the Spine of the World.
Fourthpeak was one of four sister mountains in the Spine of the World. The other three mountains were named Firstpeak, Secondpeak, and Thirdpeak respectively. It was beneath Fourthpeak mountain that Mithral Hall was carved out.
* All sources that mention the mountain call it Fourthpeak, except for page 149 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide which calls it Fourpeak. This is no doubt a typing error.
