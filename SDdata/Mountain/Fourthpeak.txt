'''Fourthpeak''' was one of the many mountains which rested along the huge range known as the [[Spine of the World]].

==Geography==
Fourthpeak was one of four sister mountains in the Spine of the World. The other three mountains were named [[Firstpeak]], [[Secondpeak]], and [[Thirdpeak]] respectively. It was beneath Fourthpeak mountain that [[Mithral Hall]] was carved out.

==Discrepancy==
* All sources that mention the mountain call it Fourthpeak, except for page 149 of the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]] which calls it ''Fourpeak''. This is no doubt a typing error.
