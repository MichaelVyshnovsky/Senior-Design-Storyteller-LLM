'''Mount Abbalayat''' was an isolated peak in the western [[Marching Mountains]] famous for being the home of the race of oracles called the [[Abbalaya]]r.

==Description==
Abbalayat was an extremely steep mountain, over {{SI|6500|ft}} tall, with cliffs for lower slopes. It was surrounded by even taller mountains, with a three-mile wide, jagged ravine between.

The peak seemed always surrounded by clouds, and dangerous winds rushed through the "moat" around the mountain.

==Notable Locations==
The mountain itself was filled with caverns. The top of the mountain was the site of the holy city of [[Ul'sahab]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
The Abbalayar, a race of oracles and prophets lived within the city of Ul'sahab, which was magically hidden from sight.

==History==
The caverns within Mount Abbalayat were used as shelters for the earliest [[human]] tribe living in the region. Not even [[Elf|elven]] scholars knew the name of this lost tribe, but they became the ancestors to the Abbalayar.

When [[djinn]] ruled the land that later became [[Calimshan]], they gave the Abbalyar full control of the mountain.
