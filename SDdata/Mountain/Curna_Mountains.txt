The Curna Mountains, also called the Mountains of Wisdom or the Bluetip Mountains, were a short mountain range that lay in the Shining Lands.
The Curna Mountians were bordered by Durpar, Estagund, Veldorn, and Var the Golden.
Located within their foothills were the powerful cities of Tirumala, Lastarr, and Ormpe.
Within the mountains were hidden mines that produced the fabulous Curna emeralds, which glowed with an inner light.
Since the discovery of the Curna emeralds, the Gemstone chaka has been actively mining the mountains for the precious gems.
Dangerous monsters dwelt within the mountains including leucrotta, medusae, manticores, and even a pair of giant rocs.
