        "mainbody": "The '''Storm Horns''', also referred to as the '''Stormhorns''' or '''Storm Horn Mountains''', was the name given to the mountains that marked the western and northern frontier of [[Cormyr]] in the [[Eastern Heartlands]]. They were wild and untamed peaks, the cliffs and crags of which were teeming with a wide variety of monsters.",
        "Description": {
            "Climate": "As its name suggested, the Storm Horns were battered with horrific thunderstorms all year round. The eastern slopes of the mountains were battered with most of the rain as wind nearly always blew westward, and the highest peaks received snowfall much of the year save for summer."
        },
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The majority of plant life found in the Storm Horns grew along its eastern slopes. [[Turis]] trees could be found at the upper end of the treeline, along with the ubiquitous [[Bowen's flower]], and [[bentilan]] spice. [[Maxor]] plants could be found to the south, only near the [[Tun River]]. \n\nA wide variety of mammalian animals made their home throughout the Storm Horns, including [[deer]], [[bear]]s, [[mountain lion]]s, [[wolves]], and the rather uncommon [[serow]]. Some of the more monstrous or fantastic beasts found within included [[kobold]]s,  [[aurumvorax]]es, [[roc]]s, [[minotaur lizard]]s, and in the deepest of its caves, the vicious [[chimera]]e."
        },
        "History": "These mountains were once home to several strongholds of an ancient [[goblin]] empire. The empire fell to [[dwarven]] attacks, long before humans appeared in [[Cormyr]].\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tribes of the Storm Horns occasionally launched raids, although some had learned to trade peacefully. both [[Eagle Peak]] and [[Skull Crag]] remained standing and populated the [[1372 DR|year after the war's end]].\n\nWhen the extra-dimensional city of [[Grodd]] was drawn closer to the [[Prime Material Plane]] around that same time, ''[[portal]]s'' to the city began to form within the range.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Due to their majestic size the mountains inspired numerous writers to recount their grandeur in poetic verse.\n\n''Circa'' the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, there was a false rumor that scores of [[drow]], [[lich]]es, and [[beholder]]s came up from the Storm Horns and surrounding areas.",
