        "mainbody": "The Storm Horns, also referred to as the Stormhorns or Storm Horn Mountains, was the name given to the mountains that marked the western and northern frontier of Cormyr in the Eastern Heartlands. They were wild and untamed peaks, the cliffs and crags of which were teeming with a wide variety of monsters.\nThe Storm Horns were among the tallest and steepest mountains in central Faerûn, composed of hardened rock that was more difficult than most to break through. They were exceptionally difficult to traverse and those attempting a trek across the jagged terrain were in for a grueling trip. \nThe highest of the Storm Horns peaks stood far above the others, piercing the clouds in the sky. While it was a stunning view to behold, the treacherousness of the mountainside made it one best appreciated from afar.\nAs its name suggested, the Storm Horns were battered with horrific thunderstorms all year round. The eastern slopes of the mountains were battered with most of the rain as wind nearly always blew westward, and the highest peaks received snowfall much of the year save for summer. \nThe mountains formed the northwest border of Cormyr, segregating the Forest Nation from the desert of Anauroch in north Faerûn.\nOnly two pathways wound through the range, High Horn Pass and Gnoll Pass, both of which were defended by Cormyr.\nThe majority of plant life found in the Storm Horns grew along its eastern slopes. Turis trees could be found at the upper end of the treeline, along with the ubiquitous Bowens flower, and bentilan spice. Maxor plants could be found to the south, only near the Tun River. \nA wide variety of mammalian animals made their home throughout the Storm Horns, including deer, bears, mountain lions, wolves, and the rather uncommon serow. Some of the more monstrous or fantastic beasts found within included kobolds,  aurumvoraxes, rocs, minotaur lizards, and in the deepest of its caves, the vicious chimerae.\nThese mountains were once home to several strongholds of an ancient goblin empire. The empire fell to dwarven attacks, long before humans appeared in Cormyr.\nIn the 14 century DR, the tribes of the Storm Horns occasionally launched raids, although some had learned to trade peacefully. both Eagle Peak and Skull Crag remained standing and populated the year after the wars end.\nWhen the extra-dimensional city of Grodd was drawn closer to the Prime Material Plane around that same time, portals to the city began to form within the range.\nDue to their majestic size the mountains inspired numerous writers to recount their grandeur in poetic verse.\nCirca the mid–14 century DR, there was a false rumor that scores of drow, liches, and beholders came up from the Storm Horns and surrounding areas.\n* Mount Shalandragar, a tall mountain along the High Road.\n* Castle Kilgrave, a solitary castle that was taken over by the avatar of Bane during the Time of Troubles.\n* High Horn, the large military hold near to the peak of the same name.\n* Mists Lair, a huge natural cave with its entrance overlooking the road between Waymoot and Suzail. The cave served as a temple at one point in the distant past, later was home to an ancient red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco.\n* Eagle Peak, a small hamlet and popular caravan stop for travelers.\n* Skull Crag, a small mining community associated with the god of the dead.\n* Tegea, a village in the southern reaches of the Storm Horns that was cursed by Duke Gorgias until Adon and Corene, clerics of Mystra, intervened.\n* Tyrluk, the village situated at the base of the mountains.\nThe peaks were inhabited by dragons and tribes of humanoids, and some orc survivors of the attack on Arabel made their home in the eastern Storm Horns and the flatlands beneath.\nAarakocra made their home in the Storm Horns in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nMonstrous humanoids such as bugbears, and orcs and among its tallest peaks, cloud Even the malevolent fomorian gains were known to lair deep within abandoned mines.\nLike the nearby Thunder Peak Mountains, the ecology of the Storm Horns was strongly connected to its population of dragons. \n* Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco\n* Thauglorimorgorus"
