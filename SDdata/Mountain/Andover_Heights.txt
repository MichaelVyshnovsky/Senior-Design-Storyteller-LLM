'''Andover Heights''' was a small mountain range located on the island of [[Snowdown]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The mountain range stretched for roughly {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}}, running north to south along Snowdown's western coast with the [[Straight of Alaron]]. An unnamed forest and several lakes, including the [[Harloch]], [[Mal Feargal]], and [[Mal Sul]], were found along the base of the eastern slopes. The inhabitants of the island also constructed several mines within Andover Heights.
