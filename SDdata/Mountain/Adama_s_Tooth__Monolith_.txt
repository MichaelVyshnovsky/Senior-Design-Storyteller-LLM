'''Adama's Tooth''' was a monolith found close to the gap between the [[Dustwall]] and [[Giant's Belt]] mountains. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was the only known source of [[plangent crystal]].{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|118-119}}

==Description==
Adama's Tooth was an immense monolith with cleft, striated sides, which were nearly vertical. It was over {{SI|2000|feet|long=yes}} in height.{{cite book/Darkvision|168-169|18}} The Tooth was clearly visible over the nearby foothills along the path from Huorm.{{cite book/Darkvision|190|20}}

==Geography==
In {{yearlink|1374}}, the monolith lay a few miles from the [[Golden Water]], near [[Huorm]].{{cite book/Darkvision|81|8}} By {{yearlink|1479}}, the monolith lay on the tip of a peninsula of the same name.

==Interior==
A road spiraled up around the sides of the monolith. Along that road, there was a gate and a small cave for guards.{{cite book/Darkvision|192|20}} Eventually, even those defenses had proven insufficient, and instead, an airship dock had been built between canyons on the top of the monolith; all meals and services were provided internally.

Before the mine was closed, there were five levels inside it; the fifth level could only be accessed from above. It contained a number of ruins from an [[Imaskari]] complex, an incredible amount of plangent crystal incrustations all throughout, and a gate leading into the Celestial Nadir.

==History==
Some of the less civilized tribes of the [[Durpari]] considered the monolith a holy site, known to them as the '''Dragon Lodge'''.

To [[Warian Datharathi]]'s knowledge, the crystal for his [[plangent|prosthetic arm]], installed in {{yearlink|1367}},{{cite book/Darkvision|24|3}} had come from the Fourth Deep of the Datharathi mine in Adama's Tooth. Between that year and {{yearlink|1372}},{{cite book/Darkvision|170-174|18}} [[Shaddon Datharathi]] used this crystal in order to build his upgraded plangent limbs; he also unleashed [[Pandorym]] in the process.{{cite book/Darkvision|152-153|16}}

By {{yearlink|1479}}, the monolith lay on a peninsula.

==Rumors & Legends==
By {{yearlink|1479}}, an evil of elder days was said to lie in wait there, with a cloud of darkness atop the spire like a flag, waiting to cause more death, like it had unleashed before on the senior members of the [[Datharathi]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
