Eastpeak was the tallest mountain that formed the range of hills and peaks known as the Shaeradim in the region of the Heartlands near the North.
The mountain was so large that for some months of the year, it briefly blocked the sun as it rose in the east, casting a shadow over Evereska in the morning hours. It lent its name to Tower Higher than Eastpeak, the tallest spire built within the elven city.
Eastpeak was located in the southeast stretch of the Shaeradim, approximately  away from the mountain Ilaerothil.
