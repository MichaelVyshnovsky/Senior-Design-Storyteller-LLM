The '''Peaks of Flame''' were a range of volcanic mountains in the center of [[Chult]], said to be the point of entry of [[Dendar|Dendar the Night Serpent]] when she will enter [[Toril]] at the end of the world.

==Geography==
===Geographical Features===
The Peaks of Flame contained three active volcanoes, and the lava tubes for these three volcanoes connected with the [[Burning Rift]], in the [[Firelands]], a region of the [[Underdark]].

The crater of an inactive fourth volcano was located northwest of the three active peaks. This crater was called [[Morndin Vertesplendarrorn]], or the Emerald Crater.

The range was located south of [[Lake Luo]] and east of the [[Valley of Lost Honor]]. It used to be the northernmost boundary of the empire of [[Serpentes]].

===Flora and Fauna===
[[Flamesnake]]s, [[hell hound]]s, and [[pyrohydra]]s were some of the dangerous monsters that had entered the Peaks of Flame from portals from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] located below the mountains.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-2809}}, early settlers of Chult from a continent southwest of [[Faerûn]] were greeted by an [[avatar]] of the god [[Ubtao]] at the Peaks of Flame, welcoming them to their new land.

The serpent god [[Sseth]] first entered Toril from a portal beneath the Peaks in {{Yearlink|-304}}. After ruling the [[yuan-ti]] and the empire of [[Serpentes]] for centuries, Sseth mysteriously disappeared below the mountains again in [[10 DR]].

The Emerald Crater was formed in [[77 DR]] by a massive volcanic eruption that shattered the former peak.

During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], the god [[Kossuth]] appeared below the Peaks of Flame and chose a [[firenewt]] named [[Chassan]] as his avatar, leading a war against the [[pterafolk]].<ref name=SK-p37>

==Rumors and Legends==
It was said that a pair of iron doors leading directly to the [[Fugue Plane]] were located within the Peaks of Flame, beneath one of the volcanoes, and that the [[primordial]] Dendar the Night Serpent will break down these doors at world's end. She will then slither out and swallow the sun. The god Ubtao stood guard over these gates, as part of his agreement with the rest of the deities of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]. In exchange for this deed, the other gods granted him full reign over Chult and its peoples.<ref name="F&P-p109>

==Inhabitants==
The peaks of flame were home to [[salamander]]s and several other races of fire, including [[azer]]s, [[magmin]]s, and [[red dragon]]s.

The volcanoes of the Peaks of Flame were the native land of the firenewts, though they could be found in other volcanic regions of Faerûn as well. The firenewts kept flocks of [[giant strider]]s as mounts; however, while at home in the harsh volcanic environments of the firenewts, giant striders were not native to the Peaks.

The vast majority of firenewt tribes in the Peaks of Flame in [[1373 DR]] were controlled by the Ack'ta tribe, who were in turn ruled by the [[deathflame]] and former avatar of Kossuth, Chassan.<ref name="SK-p47>

Morndin Vertesplendarrorn, the Emerald Crater, was a site sacred to [[Thard Harr]] and the [[Wild dwarf|wild dwarves]]. The wild dwarves made pilgrimages there regularly. The crater was also home to the [[emerald dragon]] [[Esmerandanna]], who was a guardian of the wild dwarves' carvings.
