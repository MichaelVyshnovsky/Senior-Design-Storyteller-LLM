The '''Crippled Mountain''', originally known as the '''Celestial Mountain''', was a volcano located in [[Skelkor]], [[Laerakond]].

==History==
The Celestial Mountain was the lair of the [[red dragon]] [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]], the most powerful of the [[dragon]] tyrants of [[Abeir]]. To kill Rhodrolytharnestrix, the [[dragonborn]] rebels [[Iskdara]], [[Shurideh]], [[Reshvemi]], and [[Thuchir]] went to the interior of the volcano during the [[Battle of the Crippled Mountain]], and using a powerful artifact known as the [[Eye of Blazing Rorn]], triggered a powerful eruption that destroyed the mountain. Since then, the mountain became known as the Crippled Mountain.

==Legacy==
The ash from the eruption fell for forty days, and the dragonborn began to call themselves the "''vayemniri''" (Ash-Marked Ones, in [[Draconic language|draconic]]), so that they would always remember the way they gained their freedom. Likewise, [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]], one of the most powerful clans of [[Tymanther]], was named after the Crippled Mountain.
