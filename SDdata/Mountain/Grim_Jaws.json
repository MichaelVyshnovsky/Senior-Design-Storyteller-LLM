        "mainbody": "The Grim Jaws were a collection of four peaks over a mile high in the western Starspire Mountains in Tethyr. They were the tallest mountains in the Starspires.\nEach of the four mountains was over 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) above sea level. They stood to the east of the Trade Way and north of Zazesspur The high valley between three of the Jaws was known as Three Peaks Vale.\nThe lower slopes and upper mountain vales of the Grim Jaws were populated by ogres and gnolls.\nCirca 1250 DR, a stronghold of clerics and paladins of Tyr in Three Peaks Vale was destroyed by a horde of ogres, which slaughtered all of Tyrs worshipers."
