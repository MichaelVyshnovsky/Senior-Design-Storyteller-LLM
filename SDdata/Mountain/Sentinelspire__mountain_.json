        "Description": "Located east of the [[Khopet-Dag]], the Sentinelspire was a lone volcanic mountain in the Hordelands.\n\nThe mountain got its name from its cone, which could be seen many miles away, and was used a navigational aid by the nomadic tribes of the steppe.\n\nThe nomads of the area believed the mountain was cursed, and that anyone who went near it would die in strange ways. Thus they avoided the mountain, as it had no resources of value to make going there worth it.",
        "Places of Note": "Hidden inside a canyon in the Sentinelspire was the [[Fortress of the Old Man]], a secret citadel made by a follower of [[Bhaal]], and home to a guild of assassins."
