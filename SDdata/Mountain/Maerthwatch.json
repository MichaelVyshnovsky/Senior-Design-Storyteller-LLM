        "mainbody": "The '''Maerthwatch''', also known as the '''Hills of Maerth''', was a range of hills and mountains in southern [[Chessenta]].",
        "Geography": "The range extended in a crescent across southwest Chessenta, starting from the [[Adder Swamp]] in the northeast, then running southwest between the [[Akanamere]] and the [[Adder River]], before heading west below the [[Akanul]] and finally arching northwest along the northern flank of the great [[Chondalwood]]. For much of its length it was just hills, only rising to mountains in its westernmost stretch beside the Chondalwood. The range divided the Akanul plains from the Adder River valley.\n\nThe hills were low yet rugged and craggy,",
        "Notable Locations": "Many long-worked mines, some quite ancient, were scattered across the Hills of Maerth.\n\nIt was ringed by the towns of [[Gaj]], [[Villon]], and [[Oslin]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], vast tracts of land in the Hills of Maerth were bought up by the famed [[archmage]] and [[planewalker]] [[Azurax Silverhawk]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In the 10{{th}} century DR, the mighty [[archmage]] [[Ultham|Ultham, son of Urrekanam]] kept a tower in the Hills of Maerth. He had a great love of nearby Oslin and created the ''[[Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre]]'' from luspeel, beljurils, and jacinths found in the Hills of Maerth to defend the town before he journeyed into the [[planes]], some time during the reign of King [[Tchazzar]] ([[929 DR|929]]â€“[[1018 DR]]).\n\nThe isolationist, nomadic giants known as [[geriviar]]s wandered the lands between the Maerthwatch, Chondalwood, and the [[Black Ash Plain]]."
