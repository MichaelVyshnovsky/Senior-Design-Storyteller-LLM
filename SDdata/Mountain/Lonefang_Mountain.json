        "mainbody": "'''Lonefang Mountain''', or simply '''Lonefang''', was an exceptionally frigid mountain and, by far, the northernmost named peak in [[northwest Faerûn]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}",
        "Description": "This peak was shaped much like the pointed front part of a boat. It was reported that it could be seen by gazing out at the horizon from the north-facing mountains of the [[Spine of the World]]. Its only known entrance was an extensive shaft that penetrated a northern slope from above, and ended in a cave that was filled with the ice of a frozen lake.{{Cite dragon/230/Wyrms of the North: Arauthator}}\n\nLonefang Mountain had several subcaverns, such as a bonepit, a central cavern that held several [[magic]]al items, and a cavern filled with chunks of metal ores. There was also a long, trap-filled tunnel that was overlooked by a large ledge, which led to further storage caverns. Each storage cavern opened into the next via a frozen waterfall containing [[gem]]s. Not all of the interior of Lonefang was a series of caverns, though. One tall and wide vertical shaft existed, in order to allow a [[dragon]] to quickly ascend or descend via flight.\n\nInside this peak was also an [[iron]] prison that its owner used to confine small creatures and [[human]]s. The prison itself was cylindrical with many chambers.",
        "Geography": "Lonefang was so far up north that it was isolated from almost all sites of interest, except from the [[Dragonholes]]. This frozen mountain was {{SI|250|mile|k|long=yes}} north of the eastern part of the Spine of the World.",
        "Defenses": "The frozen lake of the entrance itself served as a point of defense. [[Arauthator]], who dwelt here, was known to cast [[spell]]s at intruders who wished to make it further into the cavernous network.\n\nThere were no known guards in this lair.",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]], Lonefang was the main home of the [[chaotic evil]] [[white dragon]], Arauthator.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Though it only had one visible entrance, this lair was thought to also have an underground back entrance near the [[Worldwyrm's Teeth]]. This back entrance was said to exist several miles to the north and west of the lair and could be accessed via glacial rifts.\n\nAccording to a victim who escaped Lonefang Mountain, the prison within looked incredibly similar to a gnomish craft that was used to travel to other [[crystal sphere]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": "Arauthator, the Old White Death, made his main lair here. He was known to gleefully laugh as he made his way to the lower-most storage cavern. Once arrived, he would roll around in the bed of gems and purr, much like an excited [[cat]]."
