        "mainbody": "The '''Vorkani Mountains''' were a mountain range that arced across the land of [[Koryo]] in [[northeast Kara-Tur|northeastern]] [[Kara-Tur]], lying at the end of the great [[Koryo Peninsula]]. They were also known as the '''Sillan Mountains'''.<ref group=\"note\">The Sillan Mountains are not located on a map, but are said to hold the headwaters of the Malu River. Maps of Koryo in ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' and ''The Forgotten Realms Atlas'' appear to show the Malu emerging from the Vorkani Mountains. Therefore, it is assumed that these are the same mountain range.",
        "Geography": "The headwaters of the [[Malu River]] lay high in the Sillan Mountains.",
        "Locations": "The Vorkani Mountains defined much of Koryo as a rough mountainous country. The towns of [[Manchar]] and [[Xi]] lay in or close beside the Vorkani Mountains, and the village of [[Mu Tong]] stood near the source of the Malu River. The mountains separated the settlements of [[T'o na'Chee]] and [[Xi]] from the rest of Koryo. One could view the mountains from [[Xai Chung]].",
        "Inhabitants": "''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], the [[Panthers of Xi]] [[ninja]] controlled the northern mountains between [[Xi]] and the Malu River in the east.\n\nSomewhere, high in the mountains, likely near the town of [[Pan (town)|Pan]] in the west, the yakuza [[wu jen]] [[No Ziar]] claimed a keep, in which he stored his hidden wealth.\n\nA handsome breed of \"birdmen\" ruled the tallest peaks of the mountains. They were enigmatic to the folk of Koryo. They were later theorized to be [[Hengeyokai|crane hengeyokai]], forming a larger-than-normal flock.<ref>{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|3}}",
        "Fauna": "The monstrous [[Krestung]] lurked in the depths of the Vorkani Mountains. Packs of these creatures raided even the best-guarded caravans, snatching away horses and humans alike.\n\nThere were also [[giant spider]]s to be found in the mountains.",
        "Rumors and legends": "It was told that the ancient [[Han people]] had hidden a great hoard of [[jade]] somewhere in the Sillan Mountains.\n\nA Koryoan adventurer once slew a giant spider, and exploring its nest, discovered the skeleton of one of the birdmen. He put it on display in the Nikanii bazaar in [[Xai Chung]], where it could be seen in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
