Mount Tesh was a mountain in Teshendale within the Dalelands.
Since around 1267 DR, the inhabitants of the Dalelands avoided the dark slopes of Mount Tesh.
After the Zhent invasion, strange things happened on Mount Tesh, such as disappearances and reports of ghostly dancing lights.
The Skondarr, a former bandit stronghold, was located beneath Mount Tesh. Its entrance was on the southwestern slope of the mountain.
