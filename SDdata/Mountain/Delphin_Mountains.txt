The '''Delphin Mountains''' were a small mountain range found in northern [[Tashalar]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The mountain range formed a triangular mass of peaks measuring roughly {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} on each side. The northern most area of the mountain range bordered the [[Shining Sea]], forming the backbone for the [[Delphingulph]]. The southern parts reached down into the dense [[Black Jungles]]. The jungle crept passed the Delphin Mountains on their western edge through the [[Tashan Gap]].
