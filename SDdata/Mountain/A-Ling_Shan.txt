The '''A-Ling Shan''' was a mountain range located in the [[Hordelands]].

==Geography==
An extension of the great [[Yehimal]], this mountain range divided the southern portion of [[Raurin]] from the [[Katakoro Plateau]].

==Description==
Like its parent the Yehimal, the A-Ling Shan was a tangled labyrinth of high, ice-capped peaks. The frozen peaks of this range, most notably the [[Mahamsaratsu Shan]] in the east, reached high into the sky. Most reached elevations of between {{SI|17000|ft}} and {{SI|24000|ft}}.

Several notable glaciers, including the [[Shigatse Glacier]] and the [[Glacier of the Dragon]], were found within the A-Ling Shan range. The glaciers crept at almost the very sides of range. Lakes from glacial run-off formed at the base of the mountains as melting snow and ice were trapped by rocky depressions. Flash flooding was a known danger in the region.

The mountain range was mostly unexplored and unsettled, and only a single pass, [[Yarlhang La]], opened through it in the north, joining the [[Old Caravan Road]]. In the west, there were no known points that afforded a crossing of the [[Jumpa River Gorge]] below Yarlhang La, so the only passage into the A-Ling Shan was via the eastern valleys.

==Inhabitants==
Among other terrifying monsters, [[yeti]]s and [[dragon]]s were known to make their homes on the cold slopes of the A-Ling Shan, and raided the nearby lands for food.

Local fauna included [[cave bear]]s and [[snow leopard]]s.

Mahamsaratsu Shan was said to be home to a powerful but evil spirit that lured people to their deaths.

The fortress monastery of the [[Tiger's Nest]] stood concealed and inaccessible on the northwestern face of the A-Ling Shan. It was home to the mystical [[Invisible Tigers]] monastic order.
