        "mainbody": "The '''Earthspur Mountains''', or simply the '''Earthspurs''', and sometimes named the '''Giantspike Mountains''' or the '''Dragonspike Mountains''', was a great mountain range in [[north Faer√ªn]] that bordered [[Damara]], [[Vaasa]], and [[Impiltur]] in the east with [[the Vast]] in the west.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The Earthspur Mountains were high and imposing; the range's tallest peaks were nearly 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) high. There were few trails through the mountains, making them very dangerous. There was a gap in the mountains where the [[High Country]] of the Vast jutted east; rumors told of hidden passes through the mountains into neighboring Impiltur.{{cite book/Dreams of the Red Wizards|6}}\n\nAt the center of the range, at its highest point, was the [[Glacier of the White Worm]], from which cold winds continuously blew around the peaks. It covered an area of approximately 1200 square miles (3100 square kilometers).{{Cite web/FRmap}}\n\nThe mountains were rich in [[iron]] and [[silver]], in apparently limitless lodes, with some [[bloodstone]] veins{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}} There were also small but highly pure deposits of [[gold]] within the Giantspike Mountains. Thus many tunnels had been burrowed into the heart of the mountains in search of these metals.",
            "Underdark": "In the [[Underdark]], the domain of the [[Deep Wastes]] stretched to the Earthspur Mountains in the east."

        "Notable Locations": {
            "Watcher's Mounds": "The [[Watcher's Mound]]s were a series of campsites constructed and maintained by [[monk]]s from the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, and by local [[ranger]]s. They were found throughout the mountains south of the monastery, being situated along the trails running down from it. There were thought to be well over a hundred of these sites; their exact number was unknown.\n\nThey could take many forms, not only mounds, such as a simple lean-to or a fire-pit with a small cave and an overhanging boulder. They were defensible campsites with shelter where a traveler, a ranger, or a monk might spend a night in safety, or a goblin or orc band might rest and defend themselves. Each site also contained a hidden cache of preserved food, water, and tools. The monks and rangers of the mountains regularly restocked these caches.",
            "Bandit Lair": "In the late 1350s DR, a large force of bandits had a hideout in the foothills of the Giantspikes, east of [[Maskyr's Eye]]. The bandits numbered about forty, mostly well-armed deserters of [[Zhentil Keep]]'s forces and fugitives from the defeated army of [[Lashan Aumersair]], and they were led by a [[drider]] [[wizard]]. Their lair was an old mine surrounded by piles of tailing overgrown with noxious weeds. In its shallow tunnels, they stored foot and loot, including a ''[[wand of wonder]]'', and they secured it with one or more rockfall traps. These bandits attacked travelers on the [[North Road]] north of Maskyr's Eye, targeting small bands of merchants, messengers, minstrels, and [[pilgrim]]s, while ignoring large caravans and companies of mercenaries and [[adventurer]]s. They ambushed and mercilessly murdered their victims with hails of [[arrow]]s, leaving none alive to tell of them, then seized everything of value, even food, but took no beasts or prisoners. Never taking the bait to any trap and never caught red-handed, it was supposed the bandits kept keen-eyed lookouts along the road and spies in neighboring communities. ''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], the Council of Maskyr's Eye sought adventurers to track the bandits down and deal with them. Any who took up the task would find the bandits followed a maze of side trails back to their hideout.{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|26}}"
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The Earthspurs were inhabited by [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[bugbear]]s, while [[drow]] could also be found. as were other monsters.\n\nThe mountains were also home to [[shield dwarves]], There were many hardy [[human]] and dwarven miners and prospectors working the mountains, as well as bandits who preyed on them.\n\nThere were signs that [[mind flayer]]s occupied the caverns that were found deep beneath the mountains. However, the adventurers that led expeditions into these subterranean corridors were not heard from again.",
        "History": "In the [[512 DR|Year of the Wyvernfall, 512 DR]], the orc kingdom of [[Vastar]] rampaged out of the Vast and threatened other lands with war. Swarming through many small passes in the Earthspur Mountains, the orc chieftain [[Ulbror]] and his horde invaded the uplands of Impiltur.\n\nAs Vastar descended into civil war in the [[572 DR|Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]], dwarves from the north and east expanded their mines under the Earthspur Mountains and into Vastar. The dwarves let no orc who'd seen a dwarf remain alive, to prevent any word reaching orcish chieftains of the nature of their enemy. The unexplained deaths of large numbers of orcs in the mountains were blamed on the civil war.\n\nAfter defeating the orcs and bringing down Vastar, the dwarves founded the kingdom of [[Roldilar]] in its place. But Roldilar fell to resurgent orcs in the [[649 DR|Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]], and many surviving dwarf clans escaped into the Earthspur Mountains.\n\nFrom the mid-1350s DR, prosperous new deposits of ore were discovered in the Earthspur and Earthfast Mountains, inspiring prospectors to brave the harsh conditions and hobgoblins, hoping to strike it lucky. These new mines were predicted to fuel the Impilturan economy.\n\nIn the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], an Earthspurs mine broke into an old temple of [[Laduguer]], and miners discovered more tunnels leading into the Underdark. They sought [[adventurer]]s to follow the tunnels and see if they led to [[duergar]] settlements. A local merchants' guild even prepared a trade expedition to the gray dwarves.\n\nMiners were still working the Earthspurs by [[1479 DR]]. However, the retreat of the Great Glacier in the 15{{th}} century had defrosted a number of [[undead]] creatures, and possibly something worse, prompting an increasing number of humanoids and monsters to travel south.",
        "Activities": "Mining was lucrative here but conditions were harsh and dangerous. Miners endured a lot of hardship to pursue their wealth, and the mining communities suffered high death rates.\n\nThe mining communities of [[Dunfee]] in Impiltur and the [[Arcatan]] towns of [[Sudrav]] and [[Tomrav]] existed thanks to the mines here. On the other side of the mountains, [[King's Reach]] in the Vast grew wealthy off trade and smelting of the metals that came out, and by supplying the prospectors who found them. They went via secret routes to protect their claims and hide their finds.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some folk told horror stories of human and dwarven prospectors, lone and \"gold-crazed\", who attacked anyone who came too close to their claims and finds, and who lived like animals high in the mountains. Others told of so-called \"gold caves\", caverns with great stacks of lost dwarven gold and guarded by [[dragon]]s or [[wyvern]]s or by gold-crazed prospectors who'd slain those beasts and seized and guarded their hoards themselves. A few such stories turned out to be true. Supposedly, Lashan Aumersair of [[Scardale]] had once led his followers to locate one of these gold caves and took its wealth to fuel his conquests."
