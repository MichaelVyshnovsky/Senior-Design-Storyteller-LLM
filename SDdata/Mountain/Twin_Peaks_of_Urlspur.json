To the south, the mountains were separate from the rest of the Thunder Peaks by the Valley of Crushed Bones. The mountains were where the Falls of Tumbling Stars plummeted down and formed the Immerflow river. The forest of Semberholme hugged the Twin Peaks eastern foothills. The Tower Tranquil stood at its southeastern foothills."
