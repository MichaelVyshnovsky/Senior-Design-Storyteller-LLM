The '''Nathaghal Mountains''', also known as '''the North Wall''', were a range of mountains in [[South Faerûn]] that formed the northern edge of [[Halruaa]]. 

==Geography==
The North Wall surrounded the region of the [[Nath]]. They ran roughly east to west, from [[Talath Pass]] to the [[Nath Pass]], but there was a hilly passage through from the north into Halruaa, named [[High Aluar]], as well as [[Bandit Pass]], which divided the range, and Nath Pass, which led to [[Dambrath]].

==Fauna==
Dangerous species wandered the outside border of these mountains in the area surrounding the [[Nath]]. These included [[Cyclopskin]], [[Manticore]]s, [[Roc]]s, [[Cockatrice]]s, and [[Medusa|Medusae]].

==Notable Locations==
