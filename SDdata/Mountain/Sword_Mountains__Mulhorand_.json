        "mainbody": "The Sword Mountains, located in central Mulhorand, served as a barrier between the Plains of Purple Dust and the rest of the nation.\nThe Sword Mountains were considered impassable by the people of Mulhorand, and as a result remained largely unexplored. They protected the populated regions of the nation from the storms of the Plains of Purple Dust.\nThe inhabitants of the Sword Mountains long plagued the nation of Mulhorand, and included a number of dracosphinxes as well as the descendants of the wizard Nezram. This mountain range was also known to contain the lair of the blue dragon Gestaniius.\n* Gestaniius This blue dragon was well known for her raids throughout the Land of the Dead, located just west of the Sword Mountains.\n* Tomb of Horuseres II This tomb, carved from the stone of the Swords itself, was the resting place of Horuseres II. It was heavily protected and had never been looted."
