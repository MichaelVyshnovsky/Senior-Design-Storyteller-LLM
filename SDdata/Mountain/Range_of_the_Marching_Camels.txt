The '''Range of the Marching Camels''' in [[Zakhara|west Zakhara]] separated the [[High Desert]] in the north from the [[Pearl Cities]] region to the south.

==Geography==
The Range of the Marching Camels ran east to west for hundreds of miles, stretching from [[Tajar]] and the [[Golden Gulf]] in the east all the way to [[Akota]] on the coast of the [[Great Sea]] in the west. It created a natural barrier that literally split western Zakhara into two geographical halves.

==Rumors & Legends==
The [[House of Dhi'b]] kept a series of treasuries hidden by magic within the mountains.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37">
