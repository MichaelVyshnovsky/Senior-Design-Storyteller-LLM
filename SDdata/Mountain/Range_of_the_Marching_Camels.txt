The Range of the Marching Camels in west Zakhara separated the High Desert in the north from the Pearl Cities region to the south.
The Range of the Marching Camels ran east to west for hundreds of miles, stretching from Tajar and the Golden Gulf in the east all the way to Akota on the coast of the Great Sea in the west. It created a natural barrier that literally split western Zakhara into two geographical halves.
The House of Dhib kept a series of treasuries hidden by magic within the mountains.
