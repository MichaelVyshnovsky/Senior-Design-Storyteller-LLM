Following the fall of  [[Aryvandaar]], it was abandoned.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Evereskan elves proposed reusing Rocnest as a watch post.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, on [[Nightal 30]], Rocnest was lost when forces from [[Waterdeep]] led by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] were too late to turn the tide against the [[phaerimm]] in the [[Battle of Rocnest]]."
