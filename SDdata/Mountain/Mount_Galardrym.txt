Mount Galardrym was a peak in the Sword Mountains by the Sword Coast North.
It lay just over 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the valley of Felrenden.
The mountain was home to the belligerent hill dwarves of Clan Forgebar, numbering sixty to seventy members. They lived in a series of caves carved into the side of Mount Galardrym.
