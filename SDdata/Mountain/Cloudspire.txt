'''Cloudspire''' was the tallest mountain on all of [[Toril]]. It was located in the central [[Yehimal Mountains]] of western [[Kara-Tur]], south of the [[Kun-Yen Shan]] range.[http://candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=22659&whichpage=13#524886 Ed Greenwood via Candlekeep]

==Geography==
Cloudspire was located in the central highlands of the Yehimal, just to the west of the immense glacier on which sat the [[spelljamming]] port known as [[the Dock]]. It was south of the Kun-Yen Shan, north-west of the [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]], and west of [[M'tsin Gompa]] in [[Tabot]].

The mountain had little mineral wealth and several interior caverns, which were once home to [[dragon]]s but were later the lair of [[remorhaz]].

The mountain's precise height was unknown, but it was estimated at between 35,000 and 36,000 feet (10,700 to 10,900 meters).For comparison, this mountain is taller than [[Wikipedia:Mount Everest|Mount Everest]], at 29,029 ft (8,848 meters).

==Etymology==
The mountain was known by many names to various species. The elves called it '''Arthael''', whilst the dwarves referred to it as '''Yauvdagh'''. The gnomes called it '''Yavalaur'''. Human names for the mountain included '''Dzayur''', '''Mount Huul''', and '''Kulmont'''.
