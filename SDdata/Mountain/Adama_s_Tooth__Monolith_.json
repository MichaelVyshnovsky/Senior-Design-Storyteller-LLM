        "mainbody": "Adamas Tooth was a monolith found close to the gap between the Dustwall and Giants Belt mountains. In the late 14 century DR, it was the only known source of plangent crystal.\nAdamas Tooth was an immense monolith with cleft, striated sides, which were nearly vertical. It was over  in height. The Tooth was clearly visible over the nearby foothills along the path from Huorm.\nIn , the monolith lay a few miles from the Golden Water, near Huorm. By , the monolith lay on the tip of a peninsula of the same name.\nA road spiraled up around the sides of the monolith. Along that road, there was a gate and a small cave for guards. Eventually, even those defenses had proven insufficient, and instead, an airship dock had been built between canyons on the top of the monolith all meals and services were provided internally.\nBefore the mine was closed, there were five levels inside it the fifth level could only be accessed from above. It contained a number of ruins from an Imaskari complex, an incredible amount of plangent crystal incrustations all throughout, and a gate leading into the Celestial Nadir.\nSome of the less civilized tribes of the Durpari considered the monolith a holy site, known to them as the Dragon Lodge.\nTo Warian Datharathis knowledge, the crystal for his prosthetic arm, installed in , had come from the Fourth Deep of the Datharathi mine in Adamas Tooth. Between that year and , Shaddon Datharathi used this crystal in order to build his upgraded plangent limbs he also unleashed Pandorym in the process.\nBy , the monolith lay on a peninsula.\nBy , an evil of elder days was said to lie in wait there, with a cloud of darkness atop the spire like a flag, waiting to cause more death, like it had unleashed before on the senior members of the Datharathi in the late 14 century DR.\n* Shaddon Datharathi"
