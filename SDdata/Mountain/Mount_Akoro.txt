Mount Akoro was a single peak of the Abbey Mountains found in the Moonsea North region of Faer√ªn.
The mountain was situated on the southern slops of the mountain range, overlooking the Tortured Land to the south.
The mountain was home to the Akoro tribe of goliaths, a group that fought in a famous battle against an ancient primordial being centuries before Dale Reckoning.
