        "mainbody": "he Starmetal Hills were a region of hills directly east of Neverwinter Wood on the Sword Coast North.\nTaking the form of a series of rocky knolls, north of Old Owl Well and to the north-northeast of Agathas Grove, and to the west of Longsaddle. They ran parallel to the Long Road.\nThe northernmost of the hills was Twilight Tor, a name shared by a nearby village on the banks of Lake Glorfindar. The southernmost was Beruns Hill. Both provided commanding views of the Dessarin Valley, to the north and to the east respectively.\nOver the millennia, the hills received a number of meteor showers, hence their name.\nThe dwarf worshipers of Marthammor Duin used Beruns Hill and Twilight Tor to worship their deity on dark, moonless nights. They also watched over the merchants and travelers traversing the Long Road, as well as gazed at the stars. In the 14 century DR, led by High Old One Immar Mistwalker, the local Watchful Eyes monitored and patrolled all the lands from Twilight Tor to Wyvern Tor in the Sword Mountains and from the Neverwinter Woods to the town of Triboar. Their vigilance and quick aid held small dwarven holds rebuild trade with human settlements up and down the Long Road and River Dessarin. By the late 15 century, theyd founded the village of Twilight Tor. It was little known outside local dwarves, but friendly travelers were welcome here. It was also a great place for astronomy.\nThey were inhabited throughout by several tribes of the Uthgardt, so travelers had little cause to visit the hills.\nThe bronze dragon Felgolos had a den (one of many) in a cave above a river that ran through the western Starmetal Hills.\n* Beruns Hill, or Mrinolor to the dwarves\n* Twilight Tor, Anaurdahyn to the dwarves"
