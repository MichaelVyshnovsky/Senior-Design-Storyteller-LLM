They also watched over the merchants and travelers traversing the Long Road, as well as gazed at the stars. In the 14{{th}} century DR, led by High Old One [[Immar Mistwalker]], the local [[Church of Marthammor Duin|Watchful Eyes]] monitored and patrolled all the lands from Twilight Tor to [[Wyvern Tor]] in the [[Sword Mountains]] and from the [[Neverwinter Woods]] to the town of [[Triboar]]. Their vigilance and quick aid held small dwarven holds rebuild trade with human settlements up and down the Long Road and [[River Dessarin]]. By the late 15{{th}} century, they'd founded the village of Twilight Tor. It was little known outside local dwarves, but friendly travelers were welcome here. It was also a great place for [[astronomy]].\n\nThey were inhabited throughout by several tribes of the [[Uthgardt]], so travelers had little cause to visit the hills.\n\nThe [[bronze dragon]] [[Felgolos]] had a den (one of many) in a cave above a river that ran through the western Starmetal Hills.<ref>",
