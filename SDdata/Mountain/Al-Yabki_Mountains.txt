Al-Yabki Mountains, also called the Mountains of the Tears or simply the Mountains of Tears, were located in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara.
The mountain range ran for several hundred miles from the northwest near Tajar to the southeast near Jumlat and Gana.
Several rivers—including  Al-Nuhas, Al-Fatir, and Al-Sabiya—originated within the heights of Al-Yabki Mountains.
The peaks of Al-Yabki Mountains were composed of red sandstone.
The nearby city of Gana supported a rookery held within the mountains that contained five highly trained Zakharan rocs and rider.
The mountains were home to a wise genie named Baran al-Amin al-Jinn who acted as a qadi for the region.
