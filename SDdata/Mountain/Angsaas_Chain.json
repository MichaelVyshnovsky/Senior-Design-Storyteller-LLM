It was one of the three Saas, \"Shields\", that surrounded and protected the Great Glacier and divided it off from the rest of Toril.\nWhite caribou grazed on the lower slopes of the southern mountains of the chain. As in the other Shields, remorhaz also were present here in large numbers. White dragons also laired in the tallest peaks in the southern parts."
