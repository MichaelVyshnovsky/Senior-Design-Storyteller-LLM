        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the [[Green Regent]] [[Galaer Grasswave]] and the [[Scions of the Green Regent]] were engaged in certain vital rituals on Standing Stone Hill to repair the city's magical wards when, on the [[Night of the Blood Moon]], [[Malarite]] [[lycanthrope]]s attacked Loudwater. Galaer could not halt nor pause the rituals for wards that might yet protect Loudwater, and so was forced to divide both his attention and his forces, keeping half the available Scions to defend the hill and sending the other half to defend the folk of Loudwater. On the third night, the Malarites came again and this time, they targeted Standing Stone Hill and the Green Regent's ritual. When they overran the city's defenses, they killed Galaer Grasswave and mounted his head on a stake outside the northeastern earthen ramparts of the city."
