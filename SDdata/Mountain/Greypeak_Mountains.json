        "mainbody": "The '''Greypeak Mountains''', also called simply '''Greypeaks''' or '''Gray Peaks''', was a rugged and desolate mountain range in the eastern end of the [[Savage Frontier]] in [[the North]]. The perilous peaks were famous for being exceptionally hard to traverse, home to many fearsome beasts, [[monstrous humanoids]], and even [[aberrant]] beings that inspired terror in wary travelers.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Paths and trails across the range's mountainsides were quite precarious, appearing as little more than rocky shelves barely wide enough for man or steed.\n\nThe range of peaks formed a massive bowl of sorts that encircled what could be described as a massive bog-forest. Rather than forming a freshwater body within the ring of mountains, water mixed with eroded mountainside to form an morass of wet earth and wavering trees that appeared to float within the sinking ground.",
        "Climate": "The weather was generally pretty poor throughout the mountains.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographic Features": "Back during the [[Days of Thunder]], the [[Narrow Seas]] ran along the mountains' eastern slopes. As of the [[Present Age]], two rivers emerged from the Greypeak Mountains: the [[Grayflow]] in the south and the [[Loagrann]] (from three tributaries) in the north.\n\nDeep within the mounts rest the [[Realm of Stone and Shadow]], a network of caverns and subterranean passageways dug out by [[dwarves]] from an [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|ages-old kingdom]].\n\nThe summit of [[Mount Hlim]] was located among the southern peaks of the mountains."
        },
        "History": "During the [[Age of the Proud Peoples]], the Greypeak Mountains were home to the [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] kingdom of [[dwarves]]. The dwarven realm thrived for some time, until it was abandoned rather abruptly in the 9{{th}} century [[DR]]. \n\nThe people of the town of [[Llorkh]] once mined for [[iron]] and [[silver]] in the Greypeaks. Their shallow tunnels riddled the mountains north and east of the town. These were old and almost worked-out, their lodes nearly exhausted, by the mid–14th century [[DR]], but some miners still persisted in working there. After the takeover of the town the [[1357 DR|following year]], the Lord's Men commandeered three worked-out mine tunnels near Llorkh to use for storage. It was told that monsters made their lairs in several other tunnels, making them hazardous.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a garrison of thirty [[Lord's Men]] from [[Llorkh]] stood guard at Dawn Pass. They remained there through to at least the next [[1370 DR|twelve years]], aided by a hired [[beholder]] from [[Dekanter]], together with its [[gnoll]] minions.\n\nA decade later in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, many [[goblin]]s were driven from their homes in the mountains by the horrific acts taken by the [[Beast Lord]] in [[Dekanter]]. They went fleeing for settlements near the mountains, such as [[Parnast]] to the west.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the mountains were rumored to hold caches of treasure stashed away by the Cult of the Dragon.",
        "Notable Locations": "====Paths & Trails====\n* [[Dawn Pass Trail]], the precarious trail that crossed the Graypeak Mountains through [[Dawn Pass]], that was preferred by [[Zhentarim]] caravans.\n* [[Bleached Bones Pass]], a less precarious path through the mountains further south that once connected an [[Dekanter|ancient Netherese city]] with the great [[elven]] realm of [[Illefarn]].\n\n====Landmarks====\n* [[The Hunting lodge (Greypeak Mountains)|Hunting lodge]], an old stone-and-wood mountain home that was used by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the late 15{{th}} century.\n* [[Seshrentor]], a tower that stood in the Greypeaks, {{SI|40|mi|k}} north-northeast of Llorkh.\n* [[Temple of Annam (Greypeak Mountains)|Temple to Annam]], an ancient place of worship built upon the highest of the mountains, in honor of [[Annam All-Father]], patriarch of the [[giant pantheon]].\n* [[Vale of Whispers]], a shrine of [[Shar]] that was formed within a secluded cave in the mountains.\n\n====Settlements====\n* [[Deadstone Cleft]], the canyon home of a [[stone giant]] tribe that believed it sacred to their god [[Skoraeus Stonebones]].\n* [[Dekanter]], the ruined mines of ancient [[Netheril]] that became the site of an arcane laboratory, and eventually the domain of the horrifying [[Beast Lord]].\n* [[Parnast]], the small village set at the base of the mountains along the Dawn Pass Trail.{{Cite adventurers league/Treasure of the Broken Hoard|6}}{{Cite adventurers league/Uninvited Guests|6}}\n* [[Thousand Faces]], another stone giant settlement; this one having been wiped out by [[beholder]]s.\n* [[Xonthal's Tower]], a small settlement built around its namesake tower, at the base of the [[Mount Hilp]] along the southern peaks of the range.\n* [[White Fate]], a colony of [[beholder]]s was located in a valley in the mountains somewhere south east of Llorkh.>",
