        "mainbody": "The Sunrise Mountains were mountain range in the Unapproachable East that formed much of that Thays eastern border. The peaks extended north into the neighboring country of Rashemen. \nIn the years after the fall of Netheril, before Dale Reckoning, a kingdom arose within the peaks of the Sunrise Mountains. The lives of the realms people were blessed by the wise council and beneficial magic of the wizard known as Fastrin the Delver. When Fastrin was exploring an ancient ruin, he came across a primeval red tome, from the \"dawn of time\", that detailed the ritual of Unmaking which could theoretically end Torils existence.\nSometime around 1372 DR, a group of adventurers came upon a group of nearly-blind, albino humans that closely resembled the Mulan people of the eastern lands. Reports stated that they brandished gold weapons that were as strong as steel and wielded a form of magic that gave off no eminence of light.\nA few years later, the atropal known as Xingax began creating undead abominations within a manufactory set into the mountains, at the behest of the lich Szass Tam.\nThe mountains marked the edge of Faer√ªn. The Sunrise Mountains were quite high, towering a good  above sea level and were full of old Raumathar ruins.\nA secret realm inhabited by gnomes, known as Songfarla the Hidden Kingdom, was located underneath the eastern slopes of these mountains.\n*Pass of Thazar This break in the southern mounts allowed for eastward travel out of Thay, by means of the Eastern Way.\n*Fraasz A duergar city located deep beneath the mountain range.\n*Mines of Tethkel These deep shafts were rich with iron and plagued by kobold and goblin incursions.\n*Thazar Keep This Thayan stronghold was located in the tharch of Thazalhar within the southern peaks of the Sunrise Mountains, overlooking the Thazar Pass.\n*Quickstrike The ancient ancestor worm lived within tombs interred beneath the mountain."
