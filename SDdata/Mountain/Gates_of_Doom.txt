The '''Gates of Doom''' was the name given to two pillars of rock in the [[Dalelands]] that had a path between them. They marked the entrance to [[Oversember Vale]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]].{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|48-50}}

==Inhabitants==
When the [[Cult of the Dragon]] occupied the area, they guarded the Gates of Doom. Any who passed through the gates without leave was attacked without question or hesitation.
