        "Notable Locations": "* [[Fire giant hall]], a [[fire giant]] settlement that was established following the tribe's displacer from [[Needle Peak]] by [[Hartkiller]]. It was situated on a plateau that joined two of the Three Sisters, upon which they dug around their complex a network of trenches filled with boiling [[oil]]. The sky around this hall was strategically blocked out by the giants with black smoke.",
