        "mainbody": "ount Zatal was a volcanic mountain in Maztica. The people of the Valley of Nexal considered it sacred to the god Zaltec. Mount Zatal was also the highest peak in Maztica, at around 19,000 feet (5,800 m) high.\nMount Zatal was a volcanic mountain that was just south of the Valley of Nexal. There were hot caves and tunnels within the mountain that held rivers and lakes of lava and even pools of molten gold.\nNo humans lived on Mount Zatals slopes, but the mysterious Ancient Ones lived within its caves.\nThe young tlalocoatl Hokioptl also lived in caverns below Mount Zatal, having been sent by Azul to guard the Cloak of One Plume there.\nAlthough Mount Zatal was dormant for many centuries, it periodically acted up. During the reign of the Nexalan Revered Counselor Izco, shortly after the consecration of an expansion of Nexals Great Pyramid of Zaltec, it erupted, which the Nexalans took to mean that the consecration sacrifice was insufficient, and quickly arranged another.\nYears later, when Naltecona was the Revered Counselor, the omen of the third year was that Mount Zatal belched smoke and ash for twelve days, before a mysterious breeze on the thirteenth day came from the east to wipe the clouds away. In addition, for the seventh years omen, the snow on Zatals summit turned blood-red for ten days. Finally, in the tenth year, Mount Zatal erupted again as Nexal fell and Qotal returned, covering the valley in ash and smoke."
