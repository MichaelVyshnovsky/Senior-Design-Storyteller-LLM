The '''Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains''' were a series of mountain ranges in southwestern [[Kara-Tur]]. They were called the '''Peerless Mountains''' (or "Wu Pi Te Shan Mo") and also spelled the '''Wu Pi Te Shar Mountains''' (or simply "Wu Pi Te Shar"). They were the southern part of the great [[Yehimal]] range that dominated the continent.

==Geography==
The Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains stood south of the country of [[Tabot]] (whose southern borders extended into the mountains)), and north of the [[Sempadan Forest]].<ref group="note">No canon map labels both the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains and the World Pillar Mountains, but comparison of the different maps of the area confirms the connection. It is possible they overlap, but, owing to the narrow link between the two ranges and their very different descriptions and populations, this article assumes they are distinct ranges. The two western branches, meanwhile, linked to the extensive [[Shao Mountains]] network of southern Kara-Tur; these were separated by the Medan Perang upland.<ref group="note">The adventure ''[[Ronin Challenge]]'' refers a few times to the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains, but very frequently says simply "Shao Mountains", implying that the latter is a diminutive of the full name. However, the main map in ''Ronin Challenge'' is titled "Shao Mountains" and shows the Northern and Southern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains and a network of lesser ranges in the east (and none called "Shao"), implying these are all part of a larger Shao Mountains network. ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'' resolves this contradiction by labeling the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains in the west and the Shao Mountains in the east and declaring them to be separate ranges. Owing to this retcon, and because the ''Ronin Challenge'' adventure focuses wholly on the eastern ranges, all mentions of "Wu Pi Te Shao" in the adventure should be assumed to actually refer to the Shao Mountains. The legend of the creation of the Shao Mountains allows them to have once been a part of the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains. Finally, it should be noted that the maps accompanying ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' depict all these mountains as a single, solid mass, with no Hanya Maut Wasteland in the middle, before ''Ronin Challenge'' developed and redesigned the area.

==Description==
The lower slopes of the mountains, those facing Tabot and greater Kara-Tur to the north and northeast, were swathed in lush vegetation, and experienced warm and humid weather. Nevertheless, Tabot suffered avalanches, mud-slides, dust-storms, and bitterly cold winds descending from the glaciers. The Peerless Mountains steadily grew to soaring heights, with frozen and jagged peaks. These proved an insurmountable barrier to the Tabotans.

==Locations==
The Northern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains held [[Kemati Valley]] and [[Keru'ai Valley]], while the Southern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains held [[Senja Plateau]] and the forested [[Kaget Valley]], which could be reached from the Medan Perang Grasslands via the [[Tentu Pass]]. The Shao Mountains Trail ran east out of the Southern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains and to [[Tangkap Oasis]] in the very center of the Hanya Maut Wasteland.

In the western mountains, lying beside a glacier was the high [[Forbidden Plateau]]. It could only be reached by the [[Phantom Pass]].The ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' game does not mention the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains, but the sites in the game may be located there by comparing the game maps with canon maps of the region.

The [[Web Mountains]] were an area of the range lying between Konigheim in the Utter East and the [[Herne's Wood]] part of the Sempadan Forest.

In the far southwestern reach, beyond Konigheim and the Web Mountains, were the [[Puzzle Palace]] and the [[Hall of Wonder (Utter East)|Hall of Wonder]].

A secret, major temple to [[Grumbar]] was hidden within the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains. Typical of its kind, it would be concealed in a natural cavern or else cunningly crafted to resemble the surround terrain.<ref>

A large [[spelljammer]] port called [[the Dock]] was operated by the [[Arcane (race)|arcane]] at the center of the largest glacial expanse of the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains.<ref>

==Inhabitants==
[[Yeti]] dwelled in Wu Pi Te Shar. Regularly, evil yeti gathered into packs and came down to hunt the people of Tabot, harassing the monasteries and killing or kidnapping [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]]s.

Atop the Forbidden Plateau stood the [[Kingdom of Nix]], which was home to [[goblin]]s and [[harpies]].

==History==
In [[1089 DR|Shou Year 2339 (1089 DR)]], a massive yeti pack hunt known to the Tabotans as the [[Kume Sa Yeti]] descended from Wu Pi Te Shar to raid [[Frekang Gompa]]. The yeti slew or carried off 280 lamas of the gompa's 400-strong population.

In [[1357 DR|Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR)]], the yeti emerged from Wu Pi Te Shar once again to raid [[Nafeen Gompa]], killing 23 and causing great damage. Some Tabotans feared the coming of another Kume Sa Yeti, and the authorities in [[Thok]] organized a hunting expedition against them.
