        "mainbody": "The Icerim Mountains were located in the far northern expanses of the Hordelands bordering Narfell and Rashemen.\nThese mountains were once part of the Great Glacier, but a recession of the ice over the centuries had separated the Icerim.\nThe mountain range was once home to the two realms of Dareth and Hoarfaern, with Dareth laying in the central parts of the mountains that divided the Great Glacier from the Great Ice Sea, and the Hoarfaern located in the northern end of the mountains.\nMany tribes lived within the Icerim Mountains, including the Tark, Chif, and Dagranost."
