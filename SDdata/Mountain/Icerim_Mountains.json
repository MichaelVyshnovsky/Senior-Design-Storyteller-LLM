        "History": "The mountain range was once home to the two realms of [[Dareth]] and [[Hoarfaern]], with Dareth laying in the central parts of the mountains that divided the [[Great Glacier]] from the [[Great Ice Sea]], and the Hoarfaern located in the northern end of the mountains.",
        "Inhabitants": "Many tribes lived within the Icerim Mountains, including the [[Tark]], [[Chif]], and [[Dagranost]]."
