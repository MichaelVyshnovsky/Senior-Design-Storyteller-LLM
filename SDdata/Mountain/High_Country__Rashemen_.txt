The High Country was a range of hills found in the nation of Rashemen.
Resonating with old magic, the High Country was said to be a place of unusual happenings and evil beasts. The peaks and hills were intercut by scores of small valleys that wound in between them. Many of the crests were dotted with magical stone menhirs that dated back to the ancient Raumathari empire.
Extending northing from the great Sunrise Mountains, the High Country encircled southern Rashemen along its east and southeastern borders.
A great number of wild predators such as wolves, snow tigers, and even winter wolves roamed the hills, occasionally working in concert with the local goblins and trolls.
Legend stated that the stone monoliths found in the High Country were once used to imprison demons from Narfell.
One local tale spoke of a man wandering the countryside who encountered one of the spirits of the High Country, only to learn the apparition was once a Rashemaar soldier who only wanted to a consoling word to his grieving widow.
The High Country was home to monstrous creatures such as goblins, trolls, kobolds, and even half-dragons, along with bands of solitary, primitive hunters that barely survived in the desolate hills.
At least one community of duergar were believed to live within the ground beneath the High Country.
In addition to the High Countrys mortal inhabitants, it was haunted with the ghosts of Rashemaar and Tuigan warriors that died during the Tuigan invasion.
