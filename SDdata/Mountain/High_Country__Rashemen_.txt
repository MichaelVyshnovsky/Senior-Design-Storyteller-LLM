The '''High Country''' was a range of hills found in the nation of [[Rashemen]].

==Description==
Resonating with old [[magic]], the High Country was said to be a place of unusual happenings and evil beasts. The peaks and hills were intercut by scores of small valleys that wound in between them. Many of the crests were dotted with magical stone [[menhir]]s that dated back to the ancient [[Raumathar]]i empire.

==Geography==
Extending northing from the great [[Sunrise Mountains]], the High Country encircled southern Rashemen along its east and southeastern borders.

===Flora & Fauna===
A great number of wild predators such as [[wolves]], [[snow tiger]]s, and even [[winter wolves]] roamed the hills, occasionally working in concert with the local [[goblin]]s and [[troll]]s.

==Rumors & Legends==
Legend stated that the stone monoliths found in the High Country were once used to imprison [[demon]]s from [[Narfell]].

==Notable Locations==
One local tale spoke of a man wandering the countryside who encountered one of the [[spirit]]s of the High Country, only to learn the apparition was once a [[Rashemaar]] soldier who only wanted to a consoling word to his grieving widow.

==Inhabitants==
The High Country was home to monstrous creatures such as goblins, trolls, [[kobold]]s, and even [[half-dragon]]s, along with bands of solitary, primitive hunters that barely survived in the desolate hills.

At least one community of [[duergar]] were believed to live within the ground beneath the High Country.

In addition to the High Country's mortal inhabitants, it was haunted with the [[ghost]]s of [[Rashemaar]] and [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Tuigan warriors]] that died during the Tuigan invasion.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Hurrahesh]], an intelligent and particularly strong winter wolf.
* [[Kissethkashaan]], a great and mighty [[white dragon]].
* [[Nanraak|King Nanraak]], chieftain of the region's greatest tribe of goblins.
* [[Tekun|Tekun the Warlord]], the High Country's most feared kobold ruler.
