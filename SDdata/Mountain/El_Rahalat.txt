'''El Rahalat''', nicknamed the '''Shunned Mountain''', was a lone peak found in the desert of [[Anauroch]]. It was named after the [[Bedine]] [[sorceress]] [[Rahalat]], who made her home within the oasis situated at its base.

==Description==
The mountain was described as having a gray peak.

==Geography==
El Rahalat was found in the eastern stretch of [[the Sword]] in southern Anauroch, north of the [[Bowl of Loneliness]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the [[Zhentarim]] agent [[Zarud]] came to El Rahalat oasis in order to solicit the aid of the [[Mtair Dhafir]] tribe in Zhent expansion across Anauroch. The tribe's leader, [[Sabkhat|Sheikh Sabkhat]] decided the tribe should move on to another locale to escape the influence and possible wrath of the outlander group.

==Rumors & Legends==
Bedine legend said that when the mortal Rahalat was slain, the water of the oasis's spring transformed into blood. For the following decade a mere sip of its waters would kill any being that partook.

In the years that followed any tribe that made camp at El Rahalat made sure to sacrifice a single [[camel]] in order for the water to remain drinkable and not turn lethal again. 

==Inhabitants==
For a time, the oasis at Rahalat was the home of the [[Dakawa]] tribe of Bedine nomads. 

Around that time, descendants of the original herd of [[goat]]s tended by the mortal Rahalat still grazed upon the mountain and accompanying oasis.
