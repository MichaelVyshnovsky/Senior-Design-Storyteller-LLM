The '''Iltkazar Range''' was a long chain of five distinct mountain ranges that ran vertically from the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the north down to the [[Shining Sea]] in the south and roughly divided [[west Faer没n]] from [[interior Faer没n]]. The range included, from north to south, the [[Giant's Run Mountains]], the [[Snowflake Mountains]], the [[Kuldin Peaks]], the [[Omlarandin Mountains]], and the [[Alimir Mountains]].
