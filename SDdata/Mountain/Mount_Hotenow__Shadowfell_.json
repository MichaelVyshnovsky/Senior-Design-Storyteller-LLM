        "Description": "This volcano was constantly erupting ash and cinder into the air, occasionally raining small stones, Rivers of magma constantly flowed down from it, into various parts of the woods that surrounded it, These rivers emitted thick gouts of smoke and fires danced along their banks.\n\nThe interior of the volcano was full of magmatic caverns, connected to exterior caves. In the hottest and most hazardous depths of the caverns, one could find [[portal]]s to the [[Elemental Chaos]] and Toril.",
