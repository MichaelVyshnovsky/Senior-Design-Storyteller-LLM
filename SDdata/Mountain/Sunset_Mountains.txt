The '''Sunset Mountains''' were a pair of mountain ranges separated by the [[Far Hills]]. Together with the Far Hills, they formed a high, almost impenetrable barrier between the [[Eastern Heartlands|Eastern]] and [[Western Heartlands]], as well as forming the eastern edge of [[Sunset Vale]].

==Trade==
The Sunset Mountains exported black veined [[marble]] which was the main material for sculptures portraying magical creatures adorning every plaza and gracing the edges of countless rooftops of [[Selgaunt]]'s [[Old Chauncel]] mansions in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
These mountains were home to a large number of tribes and humanoids. Some [[dwarven]] clans also lived in this region. Many of these dwarves traded in the town of [[Easting (town)|Easting]]. The other humanoids were [[yeti]], [[gnoll]], [[ogre]], and [[drow]]. A [[white dragon]] known as [[Ciraxis]] was known to dwell around these mountains.

==Locations==
*The [[Far Hills]], hills dividing the Sunset Mountains into two sections.
*[[Wind Walk (pathway)|Wind Walk]], The main road to get to the dwarven mines of the [[Bruenghor Clan]]. It was usually a clear, windy, mountainous road. It was usually clear from monsters.
*[[Burning Eye|Mount Burning Eye]], one of the mountains among in the Sunset Mountains. Once yetis, ogres, and gnolls hounded the mountain. [[Will-o'-wisp]]s and [[Wolf|wolves]] occasionally strayed onto the paths of the mountain. At its apex was a signal tower that could be lit.
*[[Dwarven Mines (Sunset Mountains)|Dwarven Mines]], home to the [[Bruenghor Clan]].
*[[Temple to Shar (Sunset Mountains)|Temple to Shar]], an abandoned temple was looted some time in the 14{{th}} century DR by a group of adventurers known as the [[Band of the Broken Bow]]. Among the ruins was a crystal globe of [[gray quartz]] sought by the [[Cyricist Vraggen]].
*[[Yellow Snake Pass]], a part of [[Long Road to Riches]] crossing the Sunset Mountains.
*[[Ice Caves]], a habitat of the yetis, ogres, and gnolls spreading their numbers to hound the Wind Walk and Mount [[Burning Eye]]. In the Ice Caves, there were also [[displacer beast]]s and their masters, [[frost giants]]. The white dragon [[Ciraxis]] had its lair in the Ice Caves and was the ruler of all trouble in Easting.
