The '''Snowflake Mountains''' were a range of mountains in [[West Faerûn]], forming the borders between [[Tethyr]], [[Amn]], and what was once the barony of [[Impresk]] within [[Erlkazar]]. They included some of the tallest mountains in Faerûn.

==Geography==
These mountains were part of the [[Iltkazar Range]], a chain that stretched all the way to the [[Shining Sea]] in the south. Some of the mountains were enormous, with peaks reaching over {{SI|20000|ft}} above sea level.

The western slopes were covered with trees, a forest known as [[Shilmista]].

The [[River Valashar]] begins in Shilmista, formed from the accumulation of waters from three waterfalls in the mountains.

==Inhabitants==
It was home for many millennia to the great [[red dragon]] [[Fyrentennimar]], until he was slain by [[Cadderly Bonaduce]] and company.

The [[lich]] [[Priamon Rakesk]] maintained a lair in a tower hidden among the mountains.

==History==
Its northeastern peaks housed the camouflaged [[Castle Trinity]], a castle built into the rock face and hidden to all but the most observant. It was from this base of operations that the evil [[cleric]] [[Barjin]] and the [[wizard]]s [[Aballister Bonaduce]] and [[Dorigen]] unleashed their armies and the [[Chaos Curse]] on Shilmista Forest, the town of [[Carradoon]], and the [[Edificant Library]].

==Notable locations==

* The town of [[Carradoon]]
* [[Edificant Library|The Edificant Library]]
* [[Spirit Soaring|The Spirit Soaring]], temple to the gods [[Deneir]] and [[Oghma]]
* [[Castle Trinity]], headquarters of a [[Talona|Talonian]] sect
* [[Cave of Brother Luiman]], a holy site for the followers of [[Eldath]]
