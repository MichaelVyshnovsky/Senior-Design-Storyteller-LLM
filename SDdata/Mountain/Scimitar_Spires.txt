==Geography==
The Scimitar Spires were the general name for the mountains in the middle of [[The Sword]] in the Anauroch., but also the specific name for the eastern range of these same mountains.

The eastern range of the mountains were the shadowy, sword-like mountains that gave the range their name, and divided the [[Shoal of Thirst]] from [[At'ar's Looking Glass]].

==History==

The Netherese believed the [[Creator race|creator races]] mined copper from the Northernmost peak, which they called Stade Mountain, and created a series of connected caverns. 

During the time of [[Netheril]], prior to the Anauroch, the eastern range was known as the Lodestar Mountains. Both the Southfill River and the Tarn River wound their ways from the peaks down to the [[Hidden Lake]]. 

Legend had it the southernmost peak, known as Hatchet Mountain was haunted by the ghost of Mad Dog, a fighter from before the first age of Netheril. Stade Mountain was said to be haunted by a diva with a bewitching voice. 

Until {{Yearlink|-403}}, Netherese mines in the mountains were a productive source of metal ores including platinum, copper, brass, and steel. They were abandoned due to frequent monster attacks as the Netherese fought the Phaerimm.

After the fall of Netheril the mountains were infested with monsters that the Netherese survivor states were not able to dislodge, despite frequent attempts.
