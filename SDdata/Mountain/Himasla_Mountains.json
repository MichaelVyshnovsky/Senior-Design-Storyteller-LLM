        "mainbody": "The '''Himasla Mountains''' were a mountain range in [[Malatra]] in southern [[Kara-Tur]]. They marked the southernmost limit of the [[Kuong Kingdom]] and separated Malatra from the western and southern lands.\n\nThe mountain range was rugged and quite poorly explored, and emerged out of the densest jungle in all Malatra.\n\nNevertheless, a [[Trade road (Kuong Kingdom)|trade road]] ran through its foothills. In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], this was guarded by the Kuong fortress-town of [[Garuji]], whose garrison patrolled the road and fought with the [[Tigbanua buso|buso]] of the mountains."
