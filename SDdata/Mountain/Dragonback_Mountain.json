        "mainbody": "ragonback Mountain was a massive mountain found among the Riders to the Sky range that lay within the nation of Threskel.\nThe mountain was in fact a long-dormant volcano, within which was a network of lava tubes and dug-out tunnels known as the Bone Tubes. These passageways were lined with the bones of of hundreds of long-dead dragons.\nIt was positioned as the northernmost peak of the Riders to the Sky, also known later as the Sky Riders.\nAlasklerbanbastos, the Great Bone Wyrm of Threskel and Dragon King of Old Unther, made his lair deep beneath Dragonback Mountain. He shared his domain with a grouping of brown, green, and blue dragons of varying ages, along with several lesser dracoliches.\nThe mountains depths were also home to the Mourktar cell of the cult of the Dragon, devoted supplications that dedicated themselves to the worship of the Great Bone Wyrm."
