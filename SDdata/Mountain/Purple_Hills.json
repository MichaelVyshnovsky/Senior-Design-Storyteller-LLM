        "mainbody": "The '''Purple Hills''' were a range of hills on the coast of [[Tethyr]], lying in [[Vintor|County Vintor]] in the duchy of the [[Purple Marches]], inhabited almost exclusively by [[halfling]]s,\n\n{{quote|''Our journey nears its end. Where the hills end, Calimshan begins.''|Captain [[Deudermont]]}}",
        "Geography": "[[File:Lands of intrigue - War in Tethyr.png|thumb|''A map of Tethyr showing the location of the Purple Hills.''|385x385px]]\nThe town of [[Vineshade]] was located there. The Purple Hills was a lush and fertile land of green farmlands overlooking the [[Sea of Swords]].\n\nThe coastal area of the Purple Hills was called the [[Purple Cliffs]] – a virtually deserted land as it was not suitable for farming. The local hin were also terrified of large bodies of water and naval vessels. This fear contributed to the Purple Cliffs remaining uninhabited, rising {{SI|50'|'\"|long=yes}} above sea level near [[Fortress Faithful]] to as high as 200 feet near the center of the cliffs. The coastline was so named due to an abundance of creeping, purple flowers that hung over its edge, and the rich [[quartz]] deposits found throughout the rocks. These flowers and mineral deposits gave the area its name. The southern edge of the hills was formed by the Red River, a tributary of the [[River Ith]].",
        "Government": "As halflings were not allowed in [[Tethyr]]ean government, the numerous communities of the Purple Hills assembled their own government – the [[Purple Hills Council]] that maintained close relations to the governments of Myratma and Zazesspur. Halflings of Purple Hills were sure to receive aid from both Myratma and Zazesspur, thanks to their friendly relations rooted in trade. Minor dangers such as rampaging [[ankheg]]s were known to on occasions arise in the region. The Count of county [[Vintor]] in the late 14{{th}} century was a dwarfish hin Fleet Chancellor named [[Krimmon Amethystall]] who lived alongside the Purple Cliffs.",
        "Trade": "The farmlands on the hills produced cattle like [[sheep]] and [[wool]] that were produced in quality fabrics in Tethyr, as well as various fruits, vegetables, and other foodstuffs that fed the city of Zazesspur in the north and Myratma in the south. Some of the fruits of the Purple Hills included [[gooseberries]], [[plum]]s, [[blackberries]], One such farm belonged to [[Oraundas Haeltower]], a producer of cheap, smooth [[wine]] from vineyards north and east of Vineshade. During a sale of such wines in [[1479 DR]], treasure and other valuables began appearing in the wines. This was discovered to be a smuggling operation from the families of [[Amn]].{{Cite dragon/407/Eye on the Realms: A Surprising Vintage}} The region's [[hin]] population was known to produce [[Tintoram's Select]], a blackberry [[brandy]]. Other libations of note produced in the Purple Hills were [[Farlindell Red]] wine and [[Purple Hills Cider]] from the [[Kraljaom Distillery]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|-450}}, a slave rebel named [[Ankar]] led an army of fellow escapees from [[Calimshan]] into the Purple Hills, where they were safe from their masters. The [[human]] slaves eventually continued moving north, past the Purple Hills, towards the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]]. By the {{YearlinkName|-387}}, Zazesspur was rebuilt into an outpost of the decaying Calishite empire, keeping the Purple Hills as its territory. By the {{YearlinkName|-200}}, the Purple Hills were claimed by Tethyr as [[Clan Bormul]] completed [[Ithalyr]] on the Purple Cliffs. This became the first royal palace of Tethyr.\n\nPurple Hills was home to a population of [[Arvoreen]]-worshiping halfling farmers who were forced out of their homes in the {{YearlinkName|227}}. The hin migrants ended up forming the realm of [[Meiritin]]. Centuries later, during [[Tethyr's Interregnum]], [[Arvoreen's Marchers]] – gnomes and halflings of the Purple Hills, led by [[Estemal Talltankard]], were responsible for keeping the region from being consumed by anarchy.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the village of [[Geniste]] was swiftly destroyed within mere hours by a flood [[green slime]]s that spilled out of a root cellar. In five hours, the [[ooze]]s devoured the village and its inhabitants completely, leaving only a wandering [[priest]], his [[paladin]] companion, and several villagers alive. The village became a swamp surrounding a cemetery on a hilltop. It was revealed that the slimed emerged from what later would be known as the ''[[Gravegate of Geniste]]'', a one-way ''[[gate]]'' from [[Undermountain]].",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Dragonstail]], a peninsula that once protruded from the Purple Hills and the location of [[Carathryn]]. Both sunk in [[1123 DR]].\n*[[Grapevine's Root]], a sprawling temple villa dedicated to the hin deity [[Cyrrollalee]] atop a knoll above the town of Vineshade, famous for its [[Cyrrojubilee]] vintage wine.",
