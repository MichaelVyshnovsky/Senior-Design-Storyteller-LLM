        "mainbody": "The '''Fairheight Range''', which were also called the '''Fairheight Mountains''' were a range of mountains along the northern border of the kingdom of [[Callidyrr]] on the island of [[Alaron]] in the [[Moonshaes]].",
        "Geography": "The Fairheights overlooked [[Whitefish Bay]] to the east and separated the southern lands of the [[Ffolk]] from the northern kingdom of [[Gnarhelm]] belonging to the [[Northmen]]. and contained rich deposits of [[iron]] and precious metals including [[gold]] and [[silver]] as well as [[copper]].",
        "Climate": "The mountain range served as a natural windbreak that kept the storms from the [[Trackless Sea]] confined to Gnarhelm, resulting in skies that were often overcast and rainy. Consequently, the weather in Callidyrr was usually more pleasant, perhaps further adding to the annoyance felt by the Northmen against their southern neighbors.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Blackstone": ":This busy mining town of the Ffolk was situated in the foothills of the Fairheights. As of [[1357 DR]], the town was producing some of the highest-quality iron in the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]]. The miners, who were supervised by some [[dwarf|dwarves]], rewarded their own hard work with bouts of revelry paid for by the gold that was also gleaned from the generous mountains."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The highlands of the Fairheights were infested with [[troll]]s that attacked those who were foolish enough to journey over the passes alone or in small numbers. [[Orc]]s and [[goblin]]s from the mountains sometimes carried out raids against the mining towns along the foothills, but these settlements were not defenseless since they were protected by militias."
