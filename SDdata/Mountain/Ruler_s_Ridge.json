        "mainbody": "'''Ruler's Ridge''', or '''Calim's See''', was a peak in the [[Marching Mountains]]. It was one of the locations where the [[bakkal]]s of [[Coramshan]] were buried and then the site of a great [[genie]] battle.",
        "Description": "Ruler's Ridge was located in the northern Marching Mountains near [[Minthrux Vale]] and [[Bottle Falls]], where the [[Two Falls River]] began. It was once called Calim's See. At that time, the mountain was some 500 feet taller. A great avalanche turned what used to be a large, conical mountain into a jagged-edged peak.",
        "History": "Calim's See was once the burial site of choice for the bakkals of Coramshan and the rulers of the first seven dynasties of [[Calimshan]]. After being mummified in the [[First Necropolis of Nykkar]], the dead were carted up a road around the mountain and through a set of golden doors in a cliff-side.\n\nThe entrance to the tombs was lost to time, buried beneath rock and earth in {{Yearlink|-1990}}, when a group of more than six [[djinn]], [[efreet]], and [[dao]] fought in the mountains in a battle that lasted months and led to the death of a [[noble dao]]. The magical battle cleft the mountain in two and shattered its peak, burying the entrance to the tombs and the road leading up to it.",
        "Rumors": "A gluttonous [[aurumvorax]] that was as large as a dragon was rumored to live on the mountain."
