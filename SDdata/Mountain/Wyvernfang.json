        "mainbody": "Wyvernfang was a large stone summit amid the Thunder Peaks located just a bit northeast of High Dale. As its name suggests, it was home to a particularly dangerous roost of wyverns.\nThis mountain earned its name from the group of over a dozen wyverns, all of varying age, who called the peak their home. \nOne of these creatures in particular demonstrated noteworthy intelligence and coordination. In addition to raiding caravans along the Thunder Way, they were rumored to capture livestock such as sheep, allow them to live and breed, and cull them as needed. Thus they had created a renewable source of food."
