        "mainbody": "'''Wyvernfang''' was a large stone summit amid the [[Thunder Peaks]] located just a bit northeast of [[High Dale]]. As its name suggests, it was home to a particularly dangerous roost of [[wyvern]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": "This mountain earned its name from the group of over a dozen wyverns, all of varying age, who called the peak their home. \n\nOne of these creatures in particular demonstrated noteworthy intelligence and coordination. In addition to raiding caravans along the [[Thunder Way]], they were rumored to capture livestock such as [[sheep]], allow them to live and breed, and cull them as needed. Thus they had created a renewable source of food."
