'''Mount Sundabar''' was a mountain found in [[Sossal]] in the [[Cold Lands]] of [[northeast Faer√ªn]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|B1bIc}}

==Geography==
Mount Sundabar stood in the northern end of the [[Icerim Mountains]] in southeastern Sossal.

==History==
When the [[Dareth|Ice Kingdom of Dareth]] first fell to the [[White dragon]]s of [[Hoarfaern]] the surviving dwarves, alongside their rescuers from [[Clan Shattered Shield]] of [[Citadel Sundbarr]] reestablished themselves in this mountain and named it Sundabar after the latter clans former hold in {{Yearlink|-327}}.It was sundered four years later in {{Yearlink|-323}} by the vengeful wyrms of Hoarfaern using mighty magical items of elder origin, that sheard the very top of the mountain off and left a great plateau. Some time after the sundering of the mountain, a group of [[Avariel]] nomads happened upon the desolate and once-more uninhabited mountain and set up a redoubt for their race, remaking the peak in [[Glassteel]].

==Notable Locations==
The entire missing mountain top had been replaced by the great [[Aerie of the Snow Eagles]] by the Avariel as a citadel and temple to [[Aerdrie Faenya]]

==Inhabitants==
The Avariel lived on the slopes, and peak plateau of the mountain, at least as late as {{Yearlink|1372 }}.
