'''Jundar's Hill''' was a prominent peak found among the [[Dessarin Hills]] in the [[Savage Frontier]].<ref group="note">The location of Jundar's Hill is established on the map included in ''The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier'' as being in the Dessarin Hills, near Triboar. This location is confirmed three times in the novel ''Thornhold''. However, in ''The North'', on page 49 of "The Wilderness", the heading "Jundar's Hill" is accidentally inserted into the entry for [[Ironford]]—it discusses a ford over the [[River Dessarin]], not a hill, and mentions the [[Bargewright Inn]], which otherwise established to be located at Ironford. No information is provided for Jundar's Hill in the text of ''The North'', so this entry must be disregarded as a misprint.

==Geography==
It stood a short ride south from the road between [[Triboar]] and [[Yartar]]. It loomed above '''Jundar's Vale''', a small valley that contained the ruins of a village in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Jundar's Vale was once the site of a small and sheltered village, before it was attacked and destroyed by [[Zhentarim]] soldiers in the late 1340s [[DR]]. The child [[Dag Zoreth]] was stolen from the village and raised amongst them.

More than twenty years later, on [[Mirtul 5]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Dag Zoreth, now a member of the Zhentarim himself a priest of [[Cyric]], visited the ruins of his home to recall his tragic past.
