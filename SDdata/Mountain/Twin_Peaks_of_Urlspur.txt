The '''Twin Peaks of Urlspur''' was a duo of mountains that darted up from the [[Thunder Peaks]]' northernmost point.

==Geography==
The Twin Peaks overlooked the [[Moonsea Ride]] as it passed the [[Tilver's Gap]] between the Thunder Peaks and the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]]. To the south, the mountains were separate from the rest of the Thunder Peaks by the [[Valley of Crushed Bones]]. The mountains were where the [[Falls of Tumbling Stars]] plummeted down and formed the [[Immerflow]] river. The forest of [[Semberholme]] hugged the Twin Peaks' eastern foothills. The [[Tower Tranquil]] stood at its southeastern foothills.
