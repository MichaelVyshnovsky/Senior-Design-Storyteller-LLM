        "History": "Wyvern Tor was formerly inhabited by a vicious nest of [[wyverns]], but they were slain by bold adventurers. By the time of approximately [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the place was abandoned by the wyvern nest. Many creatures laid here from time to time, the most prominent of which was a group of [[orcs]] and one [[ogre]].\n\nIn 1491 DR, the place became the lair of orc scouts of the [[Many-Arrows]] tribe. The stories of [[Phandalin]] being resettled in this time renewed traffic on the Triboar Trail and attracted the orcs to the area.",
        "Inhabitants": "Wyvern Tor was originally inhabited by a nest of wyverns, but after they were driven out, many creatures used the place as their lair. By 1480 DR, a group of six orcs led by the leader of the scouting party, [[Brughor Axe-Biter]], inhabited the crag. They also allied themselves with a filthy ogre named [[Gog]]."
