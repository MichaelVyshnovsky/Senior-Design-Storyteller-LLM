        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The Yehimal was an enormously extensive system of mountains that sprawled across three continents. It comprised multiple lesser mountain ranges and branches, each of which had lesser mountain ranges and branches of their own. Some of the most significant were:Descriptions and lore that are specific to the individual mountain ranges (whether parts or branches of the Yehimal) will be presented on the pages for those mountain ranges.\n* The [[Kun-Yen Shan]]: This formed the northern edge of the main mass of the Yehimal, facing onto the high [[Katakoro Plateau]]. It trailed eastward, becoming the first arm extending east into Kara-Tur.\n* The [[A-Ling Shan]]: A small continuation of the Kun-Yen Shan's northern face, it curved northwest, separating the southwestern corner of the Katakoro Plateau from the [[Golden Water]] lands of [[southeast Faerûn]].\n* The [[Ghalyi Shan]] and [[Katakoro Shan]]: From the A-Ling Shan, a chain of mountain ranges bent northeast, encompassing the Katakoro Plateau. In the east, it descended in stages to the plateau. In the west, sheer cliffs fell down to the [[Jumpa River Gorge]].\n* The [[Dustwall Mountains]]: From the A-Ling Shan, these mountains stretched westward, separating the Golden Water lands from the [[Raurin Desert]]. It curved north in the [[Giant's Belt]].\n* The [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]]: The second arm extending east into Kara-Tur, this one bisecting the high plateau of [[Tabot]].\n* The [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]] or Peerless Mountains: A series of mountain ranges standing in the southern part of the Yehimal. One arm of the Wu Pi Te Shao—the third of those of the Yehimal extending east into Kara-Tur—ended in the [[Shao Mountains]] in the southwest.<ref> A third arm ran south, like a spine down the center of the 500-mile-wide (800 kilometers) isthmus linking Faerûn and Zakhara; on the west lay the [[Utter East]] and the last outpost of Faerûn, while on the east lay the [[Sempadan Forest]] and the ends of Kara-Tur.\n* The [[World Pillar Mountains]] or Jibal al-Akbas: These lay at the southern end of the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains. They were the greatest mountain range in [[Zakhara]], and separated [[northeast Zakhara]] from the Sempadan Forest.",

        },
        "Flora & Fauna": "Although the mountain valleys could be quite fertile, the high altitudes could barely support life, owing to the bare rock, extreme cold, unending wind, and thin air. The majority of vegetation at these heights were only beds of hardy lichens and mosses, and no natural plants grew at all above around 17,000 feet (5180 meters).\n\nThe Yehimal were home to the typical beasts of the high mountains found around the Hordelands. In particular, [[snow leopard]]s could be found there.''The Horde'' presents general encounter tables for high mountains in the Hordelands. To be precise, only creature information specific to the Yehimal is included here.",
        "Locations": "The Yehimal and their attendant ranges held many glaciers, whose run-off formed many of the great rivers that flowed out of the mountains.\n\nDeep in the heart of the Yehimal, hidden in one of the valleys, was the fabled and sacred [[Cave of the Monkey]].\n\nThe [[Jumpa River]] began in the Katakoro Shan and was fed by the whole northwestern face of the mountains, making it one of the most high-volume rivers of the mountains. It flowed through the Jumpa River Gorge, paralleling the foot of the mountains, and through the [[Great Pass of the Yehimal]].\n\nThe mystical realm of [[Langdarma]] lay isolated and hidden deep in the Yehimals.{{Cite dragon annual/1998/Rogues Gallery: Faces of Deception|112-118}}\n\nThe tallest mountain on [[Toril]] was located in the Yehimal. [[Cloudspire]] was located to the south of the Kun-Yen Shan range and exceeded 35,000 feet in height.<ref>[http://candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=22659&whichpage=13#524886 Ed Greenwood via Candlekeep]",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Yeti]] dwelled in the Yehimal, as did some [[go-zu oni|go-zu]] and [[me-zu oni]]. [[Asperii]] were also known to roam the Yehimal. As for [[dragon]]s, [[t'ien lung]] made their homes here; conversely, [[copper dragon]]s were confirmed not to inhabit the Yehimal.",
        "History": "According to dwarven legends, the Yehimal was the site of the very first [[dwarf]] settlements on [[Toril]], founded some tens of millennia before the 14th century [[DR]], that is, around {{Yearlink|-16000}}. Scholars estimated that they later made a great exodus out of the Yehimal, migrating into the continents of Faerûn, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara and dividing into two or three major branches. The ones who ventured north into Faerûn are theorized to have made their first settlements under the lands that would be known as [[Semphar]], before spreading westward. By {{Yearlink|-15000}}, they'd already founded their first great kingdom, [[Bhaerynden]], beneath the [[Shaar]]."
