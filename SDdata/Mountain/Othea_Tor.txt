Othea Tor was an isolated mountain far to the north of Faerûn, the physical manifestation of Othea in her death.
The ice-covered mountain was only about 200 feet high. It looked like the figure of a plump woman kneeling on the ground and hunched over. The mountain had been named by the verbeeg Basil.
Otheas "womb caves" were located far beneath its surface.
Othea Tor was located in the utter north of Faerûn, beyond the Ice Spires North and just south of the Endless Ice Sea.
When Lanaxis betrayed and poisoned his mother Othea and his siblings, Othea Tor grew brittle.
After Voninheim was covered in ice, Hartkiller emerged from the caves beneath the tor, fully grown and ready to restore Ostoria.
In 1369 DR, Othea Tor was destroyed by Tavis Burdun using Annams axe Sky Cleaver, so that Otheas shadow could not conceal the Bleak Palace and Twilight Vale any longer, allowing he and his companions to confront Lanaxis.
