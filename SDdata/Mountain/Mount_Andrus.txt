==Description==
Mount Andrus was known to erupt in steam and copious amounts of volcanic ash.

Mount Andrus erupted in the winter of the {{YearlinkName|517}}, harming the [[orc]]ish [[Candlekairn clan]] by destroying their home and killing the chieftain. Survivors claimed that the disaster buried the orc king's treasures plundered in the [[War of 512]] under many layers of volcanic ash.
