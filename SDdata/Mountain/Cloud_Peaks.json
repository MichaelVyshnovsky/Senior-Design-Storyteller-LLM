        "mainbody": "The '''Cloud Peaks''' were a range of mountains in the [[west Faerûn]] that marked the northern border of [[Amn]] and its separation from the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Geography": "While the Cloud Peaks were a relatively small mountain range, they were very tall, with [[Mount Speartop]] at an elevation of {{SI|14500|ft|long=yes}} above sea level. Many steep ravines and sudden drops lay along the paths, and the winds were dangerous. The mountains were snow-covered most of the year and quite cool. The southwestern foothills were known as the [[Hamlar Hills]].",
        "Fauna": "Many [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s roamed and grazed the foothills of the Cloud Peaks,",
        "Trade": "The mountains were thoroughly mined for [[iron]], [[gem]]s, and precious metals. The nearby town of [[Crimmor]] processed a good portion of the ore and gems coming from the Peaks before shipping them to [[Athkatla]].\n\nThe foothills of the Cloud Peaks near Crimmor were home to the first [[tree]] farms of [[Faerûn]], which produced [[ash]], [[oak]], [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] and [[silverbark]].{{Cite dragon/334/Crimmor: City of Caravans|29}}",
        "Inhabitants": "Tribes of [[ogre]]s and [[hill giant]]s lived in the mountains, as did a family of [[cloud giant]] bandits until they were eliminated in [[1342 DR]].\n\n[[White dragon]]s inhabited the mountains as well. One such white dragon was named [[Icehaupt]], who lived on Mount Speartop but preferred to never leave his lair.\n\nUntil [[1369 DR]], an [[Dragon aging|ancient]] [[red dragon]] also lived in the mountains, but it was slain by the [[blue dragon]] [[Araugauthos]], who then returned to her own lair.",
