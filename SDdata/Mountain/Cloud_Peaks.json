        "mainbody": "The Cloud Peaks were a range of mountains in the west Faerûn that marked the northern border of Amn and its separation from the Sword Coast and the Western Heartlands.\nWhile the Cloud Peaks were a relatively small mountain range, they were very tall, with Mount Speartop at an elevation of  above sea level. Many steep ravines and sudden drops lay along the paths, and the winds were dangerous. The mountains were snow-covered most of the year and quite cool. The southwestern foothills were known as the Hamlar Hills.\nMany sheep and goats roamed and grazed the foothills of the Cloud Peaks,\nThe mountains were thoroughly mined for iron, gems, and precious metals. The nearby town of Crimmor processed a good portion of the ore and gems coming from the Peaks before shipping them to Athkatla.\nThe foothills of the Cloud Peaks near Crimmor were home to the first tree farms of Faerûn, which produced ash, oak, duskwood and silverbark.\nTribes of ogres and hill giants lived in the mountains, as did a family of cloud giant bandits until they were eliminated in 1342 DR.\nWhite dragons inhabited the mountains as well. One such white dragon was named Icehaupt, who lived on Mount Speartop but preferred to never leave his lair.\nUntil 1369 DR, an ancient red dragon also lived in the mountains, but it was slain by the blue dragon Araugauthos, who then returned to her own lair.\nthumb|Snow-covered top of the Cloud Peaks and the Dark Moon monasterys entrance.|330px \n* Citadel of Amnur, one of two grand fortresses built to defend the northern border.\n* Citadel of Rashturl, the second fortress built to guard the northern border.\n* Dark Moon monastery, a secret monastery of the Order of the Dark Moon.\n* The Fangs, a pair of steep crags that flanked the Trade Way as it passed to the Sword Coast region.\n* Gnoll stronghold, an old abandoned castle inhabited by gnolls.\n* The Hamlar Hills, lightly forested foothills used by farmers for grazing their animals.\n* Mountain of Skulls, a well-hidden cave that was a temple to Bane and later Cyric.\n* Mount Speartop, the tallest peak in the range, and rumored to be the resting place of several massive, sleeping dragons.\n* Nashkel, a high-altitude village of Amn on the north side of the mountains.\n* Nashkel mines, a large productive mine that supplied iron to Amn and the Sword Coast.\n* Orlsfall, an abandoned mining town in the eastern foothills.\n* The Neck, a mountain pass across the Cloud Peaks.\n* The Ridge, an exposed stretch of fault line that started near the eastern portion of the mountains.\n* Scarsiirs Crag, the lair of the silver dragon Eacoathildarandus until he was killed by the red dragon Balagos.\n* St. Carwells Vale, a small village in the foothills near the coast."
