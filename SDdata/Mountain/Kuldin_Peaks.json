        "mainbody": "The '''Kuldin Peaks''' were a small cluster of mountains in the country of [[Erlkazar]] at the border with [[Tethyr]].",
        "Geography": "The Kuldin Peaks fell within the borders of the barony of [[Carrelath]] in Erlkazar. They were the middle peaks of the [[Iltkazar Range]], which ran north to the [[Giant's Run Mountains]] and south to the [[Alimir Mountains|Alimirs]].\n\nThe mountains were surrounded by foothills. The mountains themselves were steep and snow-covered for most of the year, and the tree line ended about half way up most of the peaks.\n\n[[Swimstar Creek]] began in these peaks, and its waters fed the [[Shining Stream]], which in turn fed the [[River Ith]].",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Shield dwarf|Shield dwarves]] were known to live in these mountains, The [[Starrock]] [[goblin]] tribe lived there also.\n\nThe [[red dragon]] [[Charvekannathor]] laired in the Kuldin Peaks and kept them free from [[orc]]s.\n\n[[Kartak Spellseer]], a powerful [[lich]] and member of the [[Twisted Rune]] lived in the Kuldin Peaks within an abandoned dwarven mine.",
        "Trails & Byways": "The Kuldin Peaks were largely unexplored and no major road passed through them, because of how abruptly the peaks rose from among the foothills. However, small trails and passes blazed by the dwarves of Shanatar were used by brave travelers and patrols or shepherds from Carrelath.",
        "History": "Together with the [[Omlarandin Mountains]], the Kuldin Peaks were the lands of the old sub-kingdom of [[Iltkazar]], a part of [[Shanatar]]. In ages past a great battle was fought here between [[giant]]s and [[Dwarf|dwarves]] led by [[Turbold]]. [[Mount Turbold]] and [[Turbold Vale]] were named after this dwarven leader.\n\nThe evil [[lich]] [[Kartak Spellseer]], hid within the Kuldin Peaks after he was freed from his prison by [[Rysellan]] on the night before his execution for murdering fourteen people.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], a year-long war broke out between the Starrock goblins and the country of Erlkazar. The humans strangely made an alliance with a tribe of ogres, and the goblins were defeated.",
