The''' Ice Spires''' were a range of mountains in the far north of [[Faerûn]].

==Geography==
The Ice Spires were located north of the [[Silver Marches]] and north-northwest of [[Anauroch]]. They were also one of three mountain ranges that encompassed the forest of [[Cold Wood|Glimmerwood]].

Two of the most dangerous weather phenomenons that could be encountered in the Spires were whiteouts and [[fairy ice]], posing a concern to even the [[giant]]s that inhabited the mountain range.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Hartsvale]]: A small human kingdom situated in a remote valley.
; [[Hotun-Shûl]]: A subterranean temple. 
; [[Ironslag]]: A great [[fire giant]] dungeon-forge, located underneath a mountain called [[Mount Hamarhaast]], or "Hammer of Ashes", by Silver Marches [[dwarves]]. A [[yak folk]] village was located on the mountainside above Ironslag.
; [[Twilight Vale]]: An isolated valley on the northern fringes of the Ice Spires that was considered sacred to giants. It was once a meeting place for the sons of [[Annam All-Father]].

==Inhabitants==
Many races of giant and giant-kin inhabited the Ice Spires. Most notably the eponymous [[Ice Spire ogre]]s dwelt there. [[White dragon]]s were also known to frequently vie for dominion over the region.
