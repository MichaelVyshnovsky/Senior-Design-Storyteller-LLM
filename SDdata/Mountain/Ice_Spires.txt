The Ice Spires were a range of mountains in the far north of Faerûn.
The Ice Spires were located north of the Silver Marches and north-northwest of Anauroch. They were also one of three mountain ranges that encompassed the forest of Glimmerwood.
Two of the most dangerous weather phenomenons that could be encountered in the Spires were whiteouts and fairy ice, posing a concern to even the giants that inhabited the mountain range.
 Hartsvale A small human kingdom situated in a remote valley.
 Hotun-Shûl A subterranean temple. 
 Ironslag A great fire giant dungeon-forge, located underneath a mountain called Mount Hamarhaast, or "Hammer of Ashes", by Silver Marches dwarves. A yak folk village was located on the mountainside above Ironslag.
 Twilight Vale An isolated valley on the northern fringes of the Ice Spires that was considered sacred to giants. It was once a meeting place for the sons of Annam All-Father.
Many races of giant and giant-kin inhabited the Ice Spires. Most notably the eponymous Ice Spire ogres dwelt there. White dragons were also known to frequently vie for dominion over the region.
