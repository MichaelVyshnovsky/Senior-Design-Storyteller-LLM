        "mainbody": "The '''Shaeradim''', also referred in part as the '''High Shaeradim''', was the name given of the twelve hills that surrounded the [[elven]] settlement of [[Evereska]].\n\n{{Quote|There is a pass (through the Shaeradim), but it is watched and warded. You'll have to wear blindfolds and bindings, or none of us will reach Evereska alive.|[[Galaeron Nihmedu]] to his captive [[Melegaunt Tanthul]].}}",
        "Description": "The hills stood nearly {{SI|6000|ft|k}} high for much of its length and were surrounded for {{SI|15|mi|k}} by lesser hills and narrow vales. They were considered largely impassable for those unknowledgeable about how to navigate within. \n\nThere was a pass that wound through the hills known to the elves of Evereska. Any outsider brought along this path by the elves had to be blindfolded along their journey.",

        "History": "The depths beneath the Shaeradim became a critical point of interest to many in the [[Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. In [[Nightal]] that year, the [[Sharn Wall]] beneath the Shaeradim was breached and the [[phaerimm]] trapped behind were let loose. \n\nWithin a [[tenday]] after their escape, the phaerimm erected the ''Deadwall'' around the Shaeradim and [[Evereska Vale]], an invisible magical barrier that nullified magical ''[[teleport]]ation'' or communication, and killed anything that attempted to physically pass through it. By the end of the month, the elves estimated that 200 of the monstrosities took up residence within the hills."
