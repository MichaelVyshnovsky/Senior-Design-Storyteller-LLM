        "Description": "The city of [[Gildenglade]] stood just to the volcano's northwest.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, citizens of Gildenglade became concerned by Mount Kolimnis increased volcanic activity. The city believed that eruption was inevitable and with it the city's destruction. Gildenglade hired a [[wizard]], [[Danirro of Alaghôn]] to find a [[spell]] that could calm the rumbling volcano. In the summer of {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Danirro discovered just such magics. He scaled Mount Kolimnis to perform the ritual only to never be allowed to finish the spell. Agents of the [[Emerald Enclave]] emerged from hiding and pushed him into the volcano. Danirro of Alaghôn was unlucky enough to be wearing a ''[[ring of feather falling]]''. He slowly roasted on his way down before being disintegrated by the mountain's lava. Danirro's laboratory was destroyed by a fire at the time of his death and all records of the spell were lost. Following the wizard's disappearance, Gildenglade received a grim warning from the Emerald Enclave not to meddle with the forces they did not understand. Mount Kolimnis continued spewing heated steam but its eruption was not to come for another century.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1423}}, Mount Kolimnis finally erupted, burying the city under several hundred feet of ash and hot mud. Almost 50,000 inhabitants of the city perished, while only a few hundred fled from the disaster. They carried the memory of Gildenglade's demise with them. Several years after the eruption, hardened lava cracked open, revealing a series of caverns that led into the dead city. Some brave adventurers attempted to helm an excavation but were faced with a strangely-well preserved ghost town infested with deadly denizens of the [[Underdark]]."
