'''Thunderspire Mountain''' was a mountain located in the [[Thunder Peaks]], near [[Arabel]] and [[Winterhaven]] in [[Cormyr]], and [[Highmoon]] in the [[Dalelands]].

==Description==
Thunderspire Mountain was one of the tallest mountains in the Thunder Peaks. The mountain's pinnacle was usually wreathed in thunderstorm clouds, but on rare days it could be seen from a distance. From the [[East Way]], a steep cobbled path turned north into the mountain, and then into the [[Seven-Pillared Hall]] through the Minotaur Gate.

==Notable Locations==
Beneath Thunderspire Mountain was located the ancient [[minotaur]] city of [[Seven-Pillared Hall|Saruun Khel]] near an entrance to the [[Underdark]].
