Thunderspire Mountain was a mountain located in the Thunder Peaks, near Arabel and Winterhaven in Cormyr, and Highmoon in the Dalelands.
Thunderspire Mountain was one of the tallest mountains in the Thunder Peaks. The mountains pinnacle was usually wreathed in thunderstorm clouds, but on rare days it could be seen from a distance. From the East Way, a steep cobbled path turned north into the mountain, and then into the Seven-Pillared Hall through the Minotaur Gate.
Beneath Thunderspire Mountain was located the ancient minotaur city of Saruun Khel near an entrance to the Underdark.
