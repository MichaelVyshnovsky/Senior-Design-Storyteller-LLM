The '''Umbrage Hill''' was a hill located a few miles south of the village of [[Phandalin]]. There was a stone windmill on the hill.

==Description==
The hill stood {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} high, with a graveyard at its peak consisting of at least seven old cairns. A northwestern spur about halfway up the hill held a small house and a three-story windmill, both made of stone, ringed by an [[iron]] fence. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], only the windmill still stood intact with little of the house save the fireplace still standing.

==History==
Umbrage Hill got its name after two feuding [[dwarf]] clans fought a pitched battle atop it, and subsequently buried their fallen warriors beneath cairns atop the hill. The cause of their umbrage was forgotten by the late 15{{th}} century DR, and only the cairns of the dead remained.

Sometime later during the 14{{th}} century DR, the house and windmill were built on the hill. Over a century later, the house lay in ruins and the windmill was inhabited by [[Adabra Gwynn]], a midwife and maker of [[potion]]s. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Adabra Gwynn's home was attacked by a [[manticore]], which had been driven from from its mountaintop nest in the [[Sword Mountains]] by the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]].
