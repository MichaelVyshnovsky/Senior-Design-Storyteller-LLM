        "mainbody": "The South Jotunhammer Mountains were a large mountain range located on the island of Norland within the Moonshae Isles.\nThe mountains covered the entire expanse of southern Norland where it jutted in between the Sea of Moonshae and Trackless Sea, measuring approximately  in length from end to end.\nA large number of giants and firbolgs, lead by a firbolg crone named Lallargh, claimed the South Jotunhammer Mountains. Many attempts by the Northlanders to oust the giants failed over the years. The giants were supported by a clan of duergar from the Underdark. The threat of a volcanic eruption within the mountains prompted the giants and their allies to push north into the rest of Norland."
