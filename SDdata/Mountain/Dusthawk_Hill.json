        "mainbody": "usthawk Hill was a tall, granite hill located on the northern bank of the River Chionthar, just east of the walled city of Baldurs Gate. By the , it was surrounded on nearly all sides by the Gates Outer City.\nThe sides of the hill had steep-faced cliffs of yellow granite that rose high above the Outer City slums of Baldurs Gate.\nBeneath the hill were a series of sea caves that were rumored to house a den of werewolves.\nDusthawk Hill earned its name for being one of the final roosting places of the Chionthar Dusthawk.\nDuring the 15 century DR, the hill was declared as private land that was protected from any non-licensed hunters. This action was taken by Baldurian officials to preserve the dwindling population of the Chionthar Dusthawk. Outer City residents begrudged the fact the land was given more care and protection than their own neighborhoods by the citys wealthy patriar families."
