The '''Lost Hills''' were an especially perilous stretch of hills on the [[Sword Coast North]]. They were so named for the magic that afflicted the region, which caused travelers to become hopelessly lost when passing within.

==Geography==
The Lost Hills were situated along the northern border of the [[Sword Mountains]], between the settlements of [[Triboar]] and [[Crossergate]]. They encompassed part of the southern [[Triboar Trail (region)|Triboar Trail region]], which extended as far north as [[Neverwinter Wood]].The name Lost Hills is only ever given in the ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)]]'', however the description in the game manual corresponds to a chain of unnamed hills that appear on maps in various other source material. Older maps depict the hills as situated on the northeast slopes of the mountains, while others set them more to the west.

The [[Triboar Trail]] passed through the Lost Hills, linking the [[High Road]] in the west with the [[Long Road]] to the east.

===Geographical Features===
Notable within the Lost Hills was [[Wyvern Tor]], which, as its name suggested, housed a nest of [[wyvern]]s.

==Description==
The hills had a series of winding paths that allowed for relative ease of travel.

==History==
According to one [[sage]] from Neverwinter, the Lost Hills were once a beauteous, peaceful region of [[the North]]. Travelers could safely pass over and through its peaks as they journeyed from town to town.

At some point in their history, however, an enigmatic malicious force appeared within the Lost Hills. This force brought with it terrible creatures that plagued anyone that dared pass through.

The hills were then afflicted by a magical enchantment that rendered navigation within nearly impossible. In the years that followed, only the foolhardy or valiant dared navigate the Lost Hills' paths.

In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, caravans that passed through [[Crossergate]] began mysteriously disappearing in the Lost Hills. The Lord Protector of Crossergate made a plea to Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] of Neverwinter, fearing for some unknown danger looming just outside the town walls. 

In turn, Lord Nasher tasked hired adventurers to begin an investigation. They discovered that whatever strange evil took residence in the Hills turned the road into a twisting and turning disorienting maze as if it was altered by [[magic]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Old Owl Well]], an ancient local well set in an area that was once infested with thousands of [[owlbear]]s.
* [[Phandalin]], the farming and mining community that was re-settled in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Place of the Unicorn]], a grove sacred to the followers of the goddess [[Lurue]].
