Some dwarven clans also lived in this region. Many of these dwarves traded in the town of Easting. The other humanoids were yeti, gnoll, ogre, and drow. A white dragon known as Ciraxis was known to dwell around these mountains.\n*The Far Hills, hills dividing the Sunset Mountains into two sections.\n*Wind Walk, The main road to get to the dwarven mines of the Bruenghor Clan. It was usually a clear, windy, mountainous road. It was usually clear from monsters.\n*Mount Burning Eye, one of the mountains among in the Sunset Mountains.
