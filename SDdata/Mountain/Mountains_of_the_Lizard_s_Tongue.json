        "mainbody": "The Mountains of Lizards Tongue was a prominent geographical feature of West Zakhara, fully dominating the landscape in the northwest region of the High Desert.\nThe mountain range stretched for hundreds of miles across this region of the Land of Fate, running northeast to southwest. It effectively separated the scorching High Desert from the refreshing waters and cool breezes of Bahr al-Kibar. It eventually terminated in the northeast at Bahr al-Dahil, the Sea of Caravans."
