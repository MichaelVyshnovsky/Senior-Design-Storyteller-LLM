        "mainbody": "The World Pillar Mountains, called Jibal al-Akbas in Midani, were the southernmost range of the mighty Yehimal and the greatest mountain range in Zakhara. The World Pillars contained the center of power and the majority of the Land of the Yak-Men.\nThe mountains formed the greatest barrier to entering Zakhara from Faer√ªn or Kara-Tur by land.\nFrom their narrow northerly connection to the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains of Kara-Tur (linked via the Web Mountains), they stretched mainly in a southern direction. To the west, they dropped toward the rugged lands outside the city of Utaqa and the Great Sea, to the east the Jungle of Monsters reached onto their foothills. Towards the southwest, the greatest kavir (salt flat) of Zakhara separated the mountains from the rest of the Haunted Lands desert.\nWhile the evil yak-men were the undisputed masters of the Jibal al-Akbas, they remained a minority. Many humans, yeti, dwarves, and dao were kept as slaves, while marrash were the yikarias only open allies.\nIn the mostly barren World Pillars, moderate numbers of mountain goats, musk oxen, and yaks could be found, hunted by snow leopards.\nThe harsh climate of these tall mountains was somewhat tempered by the warm and moist winds coming from the Great Sea, which also led to heavy rainfalls on their northwestern edge. The bearable temperatures of Jibal al-Akbas very center have been attributed to the direct influence of the yak-mens Faceless God.\nThe World Pillar Mountains were once controlled by dwarves, until the yak-men formed their empire in the middle of the 5th century DR."
