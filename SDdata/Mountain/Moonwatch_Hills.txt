The Moonwatch Hills were a grouping of rather unremarkable hills in the Moonsea region of north Faerûn.
They were situated along the northern coast of the Moonsea proper, just east of the Twilight Marsh.
The Phlan Path wound through the hills, connecting the cities of Phlan and Melvaunt located on either side.
