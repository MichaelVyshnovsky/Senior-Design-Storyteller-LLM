'''Oroth''', also known as the '''Hollow Mountain''', was a volcano located in southern [[Eskorn]], [[Laerakond]].

==Description==
Oroth was a large but low, collapsed volcanic peak overgrown with thick forest.

==Background==
As of [[1479 DR]], the area around Oroth was teeming with aberrant and strange monsters, most of them [[gibbering mouther]]s, creations of the [[dragon]] [[Lhargloroth]]. The forest around Oroth were so dangerous that Eskornar knights avoided the place at all costs.

==Notable inhabitants==
*Lhargloroth, a former servant of [[Melauthaur]].
