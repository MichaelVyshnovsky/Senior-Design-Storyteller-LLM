The Ghost Mountains, or Jibal al-Taif, were a small group of mountains found within Interior Zakhara.
The Ghost Mountains were situated between the North Quarter of Suq Bay and the burning expanse of the Haunted Lands.
The trio of mountain strips comprising the Ghost Mountains ran roughly parallel to each other in a northeastern slope. Al-Qalil River originated within the peaks of the Ghost Mountains.
