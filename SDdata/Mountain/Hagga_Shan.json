        "mainbody": "agga Shan, was a mountain range located in the northern region of the Hordelands along Yal Tengri.\nHagga Shan sat along the southeastern edge of Yal Tengri.\nThis small mountain range was covered by snow for most of the year.\nA small community of dwarves lived within Hagga Shan, mining tin and selling it to merchants in Sossal. The nomads of the Endless Wastes acquired many natural resources from the mountain as well.\nContact between the two groups was rare, so rare that the nomads had a superstitious dread of \"little men\" in the mountains. The dwarves played on these fears as a joke, and to close deals, only further reinforcing the nomads fear of the area."
