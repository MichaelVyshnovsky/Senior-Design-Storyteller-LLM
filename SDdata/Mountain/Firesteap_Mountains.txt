The Firesteap Mountains were a mountain range that stretched from the edge of the Lake of Steam to the forest of Chondalwood, then went on to the northern border of the Shaar and into the lands beyond.
In the 14th century DR, these mountains were the southern border of the city-state of Innarlith and contained a citadel under Innarlan control called Firesteap Citadel. It was from this citadel that Senator Pristoleph assembled an army that he used to attack the city and overthrow its government to become Ransar in 1371 DR. 
The mountains did not have many monsters but, were claimed by the Shaaryan tribes. They served as home to the ancient tombs of the Shaaryans, who killed or captured anyone that did not have traditional rights. The northern mountains had a couple of bands of thieves, bandits as well as ogres and hobgoblins that struck at caravans that passed through.
