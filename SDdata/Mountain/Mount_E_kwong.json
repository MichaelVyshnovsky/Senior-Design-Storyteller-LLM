It hosted an important religious ceremony and festival, and thousands of pilgrims tried to attend, but only a relative few were permitted to make the journey, as well as specially invited guests. By tradition, they went on foot, following a narrow, crowded road that wound some  up the mountain. It took days for them all to make the journey.\nAround , Tabot negotiated peace with Shou Lung and invited a delegation to the ceremony at the Temple of Heavens Heart. The Dragon Lord Mei Lung elected to attend in person (though, as a dragon, it seems he was in disguise) with attendants and escorts. He watched the procession for two days, noting people of all ages, warriors, monks, priests, and servants, before meeting Pang, a monk scribe chosen to represent Pokarr Gompa, accompanied by five temple guards. They went up together, with Pang telling Mei Lung what he knew of his homeland."
