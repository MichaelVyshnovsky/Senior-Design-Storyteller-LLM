        "mainbody": "'''Mount E'kwong''' was a mountain in the middle of the [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]] in central [[Tabot]]. not far from the [[Shou Lung]] border.",
        "Description": "Described as grim and foreboding, its slopes were stark and jagged.",
        "Notable Locations": "Atop Mount E'kwong stood the Temple of Heaven's Heart, devoted to the Celestial Heart in Tabot's form of the [[Way of Enlightenment]]. It hosted an important religious ceremony and festival, and thousands of [[pilgrim]]s tried to attend, but only a relative few were permitted to make the journey, as well as specially invited guests. By tradition, they went on foot, following a narrow, crowded road that wound some {{SI|60|mile|k|long=yes}} up the mountain. It took days for them all to make the journey.",
        "History": "Around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Tabot negotiated peace with Shou Lung and invited a delegation to the ceremony at the Temple of Heaven's Heart. The Dragon Lord [[Mei Lung]] elected to attend in person (though, as a dragon, it seems he was in disguise) with attendants and escorts. He watched the procession for two days, noting people of all ages, warriors, [[monk]]s, priests, and servants, before meeting [[Pang]], a monk scribe chosen to represent [[Pokarr Gompa]], accompanied by five temple guards. They went up together, with Pang telling Mei Lung what he knew of his homeland."
