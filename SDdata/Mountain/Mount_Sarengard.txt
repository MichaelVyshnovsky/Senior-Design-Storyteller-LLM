Mount Sarengard was one of the tallest peaks in the eastern Marching Mountains. It was the location of the holiest site to Vhaeraun.
Sarengard was located in the far east of the Marching Mountains, east of Minthrux Vale. 
A mile below the mountain in a 1,000-foot cavern, the Vault of Cloaked Midnight was found. It was the holiest temple to Vhaeraun in the Realms. The entrance was in the lower slopes of the mountain.
Shangalar the Black lived in an inverted pyramid balancing 200 feet above the plateau between Minthrux Vale and the summit of Mount Sarengard.
