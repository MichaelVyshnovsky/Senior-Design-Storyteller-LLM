Firstpeak was a mountain in the Spine of the World mountain range.
It was formerly known as Ironstar Mountain since it was once home to the Ironstar clan of shield dwarves. By 1370 DR, it was abandoned by the dwarves and the silver dragon Dargentum took up residence.
The svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone was located deep beneath the mountain.
