'''Firstpeak''' was a mountain in the [[Spine of the World]] mountain range.

==History==
It was formerly known as '''Ironstar Mountain''' since it was once home to the [[Clan Ironstar|Ironstar]] clan of [[shield dwarf|shield dwarves]]. By [[1370 DR]], it was abandoned by the dwarves and the [[silver dragon]] [[Dargentum]] took up residence.

==Geography==
The [[svirfneblin]] city of [[Blingdenstone]] was located deep beneath the mountain.
