==History==
The mountains gained their name from the tribes of [[giant]]s that occupied them.

Around [[1097 DR]], the [[hobgoblin]]s of the Giantspire Mountains assaulted the newly formed [[Impiltur]] but were driven back by the might of [[Imphras I|Warcaptain Imphras]] of [[Lyrabar]].

In [[1127 DR]], Imphras' son, King [[Imbrar I]], was lost in the mountains, while leading a campaign to eradicate the hobgoblin tribe. Expeditions in the following years, such as one led by the mercenary captain [[Delros Parander]] in [[1275 DR]], would fail to find him.

In [[1372 DR]], the hobgoblins of the Giantspires were led by King [[Kardobbik]]. To aid her king, Lady [[Farkattle]] animated the corpse of a very old [[deep dragon]] to instill fear in Kardobbik's subjects and intruders into his realm.

Prior to [[1385 DR]], many of the [[goblinoid]] tribes of the Giantspires served the [[succubus]] [[demon lord]] [[Soneillon]], however she was flung from [[Toril]] during the [[Spellplague]], leaving behind two powerful artifacts&mdash;the ''[[Crown of Whispers|Crowns of Whispers]]''&mdash;of which her goblin servants were quick to make use.

As of [[1479 DR]], a three-way conflict brewed in the mountains between powerful goblinoid tribes: the [[Blood Mountain]] tribe, the [[Razor Heart]] tribe, and the [[Black Wolf (tribe)|Black Wolf]] clan. Both the queen of Razor Heart, [[Maaqua]], and the chief of the Black Wolves, [[Aruugan]], possessed a ''Crown of Whispers''.

==Inhabitants==
Neither the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] tribes nor the people from Damara occupied these lands. The peaks were held by hobgoblins, [[bugbear]]s, and [[evil]] [[cloud giant]]s,
