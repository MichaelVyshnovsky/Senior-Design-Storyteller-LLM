The Giantspire Mountains were located on the snowy and rugged borders of Damara and Narfell.
The mountains were north of the Rawlinswood in northeastern Faer√ªn.
* Giant Gap
* Redfang Peak
* Long Road
The mountains gained their name from the tribes of giants that occupied them.
Around 1097 DR, the hobgoblins of the Giantspire Mountains assaulted the newly formed Impiltur but were driven back by the might of Warcaptain Imphras of Lyrabar.
In 1127 DR, Imphras son, King Imbrar I, was lost in the mountains, while leading a campaign to eradicate the hobgoblin tribe. Expeditions in the following years, such as one led by the mercenary captain Delros Parander in 1275 DR, would fail to find him.
In 1372 DR, the hobgoblins of the Giantspires were led by King Kardobbik. To aid her king, Lady Farkattle animated the corpse of a very old deep dragon to instill fear in Kardobbiks subjects and intruders into his realm.
Prior to 1385 DR, many of the goblinoid tribes of the Giantspires served the succubus demon lord Soneillon, however she was flung from Toril during the Spellplague, leaving behind two powerful artifacts&mdashthe Crowns of Whispers&mdashof which her goblin servants were quick to make use.
As of 1479 DR, a three-way conflict brewed in the mountains between powerful goblinoid tribes the Blood Mountain tribe, the Razor Heart tribe, and the Black Wolf clan. Both the queen of Razor Heart, Maaqua, and the chief of the Black Wolves, Aruugan, possessed a Crown of Whispers.
Neither the Nar tribes nor the people from Damara occupied these lands. The peaks were held by hobgoblins, bugbears, and evil cloud giants,
* Aruugan, the hobgoblin chief of the Black Wolf tribe in the late 15 century DR.
* Garnuuk, the bugbear chief of the Blood Mountain clan in the late 15 century DR.
* Kardobbik, king of the hobgoblins of the mountains in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
* Maaqua, the hobgoblin queen of the Razor Heart tribe in the late 15 century DR.
