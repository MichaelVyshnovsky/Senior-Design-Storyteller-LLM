Perytons and wyverns vied for the high ledges to use as perches, while giant slugs and worse things overtook the dark interior of the mountain.\nThe Crag sat in the northern Cloud Peaks, overlooking the Neck near Citadel Amnur.\nThe mountain was controlled by the ancient silver dragon Eacoathildarandus, who laired atop it. He was slain in the  by the great red dragon Balagos in order to remove any potential competition from other old dragons in the region. Having fulfilled his mission, Balagos did not use the lair and simply left it abandoned."
