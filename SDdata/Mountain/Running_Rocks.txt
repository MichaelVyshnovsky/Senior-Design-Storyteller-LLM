The Running Rocks was a series of mountains located in the nation Rashemen, within the greater Unapproachable East.
The mounts comprised a succession of solid granite peaks intercut by a series of chasms and canyons. They were said to resemble the clenched hands of stone giants reaching up from beneath the surface of Toril.
The Running Rocks were considered to be a continuation of the mountains that formed the High Country of Rashemen.
The River Rasha originated from among the peaks of the Running Rocks, before flowing south to Lake Tirulag.
Immil Vale was a hidden crevasse found within the peaks that remained evergreen all year round, and was believed to have been blessed by The Hidden One herself.
A small number of copper and iron mines have been established within the mountains, though none were active as of the midâ€“14 century DR.
The mountains were thought to be a place of mysticism that was revered by the people of Rashemen.
The Running Rocks were mostly left uninhabited by the Rashemaar people, save for the secluded caves that housed the ancient vremyonni. The hidden domains of the Old Ones were protected by powerful magic and great stone doors that were unmovable by all but those familiar with their command words.
Malevolent drow and wicked bheur hags made their home in the Running Rocks, along with some more monstrous humanoids like trolls.
