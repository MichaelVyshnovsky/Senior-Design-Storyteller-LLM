The '''Running Rocks''' was a series of mountains located in the nation [[Rashemen]], within the greater [[Unapproachable East]].

==Description==
The mounts comprised a succession of solid [[granite]] peaks intercut by a series of chasms and canyons. They were said to resemble the clenched hands of [[stone giant]]s reaching up from beneath the surface of [[Toril]].

==Geography==
The Running Rocks were considered to be a continuation of the mountains that formed the [[High Country (Rashemen)|High Country]] of Rashemen.

===Geographical Features===
The [[River Rasha]] originated from among the peaks of the Running Rocks, before flowing south to [[Lake Tirulag]].{{Template:Cite book/Unapproachable East|129}}

[[Immil Vale]] was a hidden crevasse found within the peaks that remained evergreen all year round, and was believed to have been blessed by [[The Hidden One]] herself.

==Trade==
A small number of [[copper]] and [[iron]] mines have been established within the mountains, though none were active as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The mountains were thought to be a place of mysticism that was revered by the people of Rashemen.

==Inhabitants==
The Running Rocks were mostly left uninhabited by the [[Rashemaar]] people, save for the secluded caves that housed the ancient [[vremyonni]]. The hidden domains of the Old Ones were protected by powerful [[magic]] and great stone doors that were unmovable by all but those familiar with their [[command word]]s.

Malevolent [[drow]] and wicked [[bheur]] hags made their home in the Running Rocks, along with some more [[monstrous humanoid]]s like [[troll]]s.
