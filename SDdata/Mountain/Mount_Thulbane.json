Its violent eruption following the Spellplague lent to the transformation of the Realm and the further domination of its dracolich overlord, the Great Bone Wyrm.\nIt was the highest peak in all of Threskel, Chessenta, or Unther.\nThe solitary mountain stood high above the flat plains over Threskel, dominating its skyline and lording itself over the surrounding landscape. The Fields of Pryollus lay at the southern base of the mountain.\nAlthough thought to be extinct, Mount Thulbane was merely dormant.\nWhen the Spellplague struck Toril in the , much of the upper levels of the ground collapsed into the Underdark below and sparked geological activity across the lands. Mount Thulbane became active once more, and continuously filled the skies above with black ash that darkened the skies and allowed undead dragons to roam wild during all hours of the day.\nAccording to local myths, Mount Thulbane was home to the god Assuran, the Untheric god of vengeance.\n* Thayan embassy, a 15 century enclave that housed necromancers from Thay along their undead servitors.\n* Jaxanaedegor, the vampiric green dragon that masqueraded as the deity Assuran, before proclaiming himself the Viscount of Threskel.\n* Malanthus Stormstaern, a mage that served as Magister for a time during the 2 century DR."
