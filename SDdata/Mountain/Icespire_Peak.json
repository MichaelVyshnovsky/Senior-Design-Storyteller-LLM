        "mainbody": "'''Icespire Peak''' was a mountain located in the [[Sword Mountains]] on the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]] region of [[the North]].\n\n{{Quote|...I've heard the Icehammer dwarves have dredged up some ancient evil on Icespire Peak. I don't know details, but it must be pretty serious because they've even been calling for outside assistance to help them deal with it.|Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]], c. [[1479 DR]].}}",
        "Description": "Icespire Peak was a jagged, snow-topped mountain and the tallest peak of the Sword Mountains. It was formed park by the frozen remains of a [[Lakkar|long-dead frost giant]] that grew to near-unimaginable size by magical means.\n\nIn the winter, the beauteous waterfalls that ran down the mountain slopes would freeze over, forming curtains of ice that were stunning to behold.\n\nMines rich with [[mithral]] wound through the heart of the mountain.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Certain naturally-forming landmarks of the mountain were given distinct names such as 'Prospector's Ridge' and 'Windchill Reach'."
        },
        "History": "The warlord [[Delsendra Amzarr]] built Icespire Hold on Icespire Peak and lived in the fortress for many years. She kept the [[orcs]] of the Sword Mountains at bay until the supply chains were cut off by the extreme weather of a very harsh winter. Delsendra and her soldiers were trapped in the fortress and starved to death.\n\nWhen Icespire Hold was abandoned, it was damaged by an earthquake. Ten years later, an orc tribe led by the war chief [[Kra]] took over the fortress. The orcs' reign didn't last long because the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] decided to make Icespire Hold its new lair. He gained access through the southwest section that was still damaged by the earthquake. Cryovain ate Kra and several other orcs, causing the remaining orcs to flee.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the dwarves of [[Clan Icehammer]] discovered the [[Winterforge]] [[artifact]] within Icespire Peak, along with the frozen body of [[Lakkar]]. After the frost giant [[Hrimnir]] caught wind of this discovery, he decided to recreate Lakkar's exploits. Hrimnir gathered an army of frost creatures and tried to acquire the Winterforge for himself. In the end was killed by [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|some adventurers]] from [[Neverwinter]] that allied themselves with [[Florin Icehammer]].\n\nDuring the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the reborn [[Cult of the Dragon]] took over at least one of the Icehammer [[mithral]] mines, while the dwarves were busy dealing with [[frost goblin]]s. Dragon Cult agents led by [[Dragonsoul]] [[Theures]] stole mithral from within the mine and used it for their own nefarious ends. Fortunately for the Icehammer dwarves, the cult's efforts were thwarted by [[Fitzhugh Montgomery]] of the [[Lords' Alliance]] and his [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer ally]].\n\nCryovain continued to occupy the fortress ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1491}}.<ref group=\"note\">The description of the town of [[Phandalin]] in the '''''Dungeons & Dragons Essentials Kit''''' is the same as in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set]]'', which is set in [[1491 DR]]. This includes the same ages being given for both [[Elmar Barthen]] (p. 9 in the ''Essential Kit'' and p.16 in the ''Starter Set'') and [[Linene Graywind]] (p. 9 in the ''Essential Kit'' and p. 17 in the ''Starter Set'').",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Fallen Axe Bridge]], this landmark was a massive bridge formed from a colossal-sized [[axe]] that spanned a great chasm adjacent to the mountain.\n* [[Frozen Heart]], this giant fortress housed the [[Winter Forge]], an artifact associated with the [[Elemental Chaos]].\n* [[Icespire Hold]], a well-protected stone fortress situated on the northeast spur of the mountain at an altitude of {{SI|2500|ft}}. Surrounded by sheer, icy cliffs, it was only accessible by a narrow trail.\n* [[Toreundar]], a mountain village founded by the dwarves of [[Clan Icehammer]].",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Cryovain]], a young [[white dragon]] that claimed much of the Sword Mountains as its own domain.\n* [[Lakkar]], the original owner of the Winter Forge.\n* [[Merothrax]], the [[white dragon]] ally of the Cult of the Dragon."
