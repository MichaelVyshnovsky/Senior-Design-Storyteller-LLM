The Machran Spire was a mountainous outcropping of granite found near the village of Gurnth within the Gulthmere Forest.
Nobanion was believed to have held court atop the Machran Spire numerous times. As such, the Spire was used as a temple to the King of Lions.
Lammasu and greater lammasu inhabited the spire for most of the year. The priests of Nobanion inhabiting the spire had numerous werelions among their ranks.
Any devout follower of the King of Lions who spent the night atop the Machran Spire was blessed with the benefits of a heal or regenerate spell in severe cases.
