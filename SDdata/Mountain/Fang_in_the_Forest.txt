The Fang in the Forest, formerly known as Daerlos Rest, was a conical-shaped peak and the southernmost of the Earthfast Mountains. It was thought to have been an extinct volcano and was said to be partially hollow.
The peak was best known as the lair of the ancient green dragon Aglaraerose. Deep inside the mountain was her lair, which she named the Lure of Jaws.Ed Greenwood. "Eye on the Realms  The Dragon That Never Died." Dragon  #424. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, June, 2013.
The peak was originally known as "Daerlos Rest" after a local forester who was gored by a boar and laid to rest on the mountainside.
In the later 14th century DR, Aglaraerose built a lair in the mountain and was still believed to inhabit the peak in the late 15th century DR, although she was never seen.Ed Greenwood. "Eye on the Realms  The Dragon That Never Died." Dragon  #424. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, June, 2013.
