Mount Phevos was the tallest peak in the Alimir Mountains.
Mt. Phevos was in the central Alimir Mountains. Its elevation was 8,500 feet (2,600 meters) above sea level. 
The towering peak was visible from 50 miles outside of Almraiven. Its west-facing cliffs were half of the carvings known as the Eye Tyrant Cliffs.
The carvings on Mount Phevos celebrated the victory of the eye tyrants against the Calishites during the Third Age of Calimshan.
