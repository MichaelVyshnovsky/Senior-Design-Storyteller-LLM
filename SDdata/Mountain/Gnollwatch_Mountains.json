        "mainbody": "'''The Gnollwatch Mountains''' were a medium small mountain range that ran east to west through [[Dambrath]] for approximately 700 miles and eventually declined and became the [[Hills of the Dead Kings]] in the east.",
        "Geographical Features": "The Gnollwatches were not impressive peaks because of the [[Muaraghal Mountains]] to the west but had several moderate peaks over {{SI|9000|ft}}. [[Mount Hazail]] was the tallest peak at {{SI|11500|ft}}. The mountains were not particularly sharp, as the peaks had worn down with the passage of time.",
        "Environment": "The mountains got snow during the winter months of the year. Below the timberline the mountains were covered with [[shadowtop]], [[suthwood]], [[pine]] and patches of mountain meadows.\n\nThe mountains also had rich deposits of [[silver]] which were actively mined every year.",
        "Inhabitants": "As per their namesake, the mountains were home to numerous tribes of [[gnolls]] living there.  Some tribes were belligerent but many maintained trade relations with Dambrath. One leader, [[Grubash Blacksnout]] had disciplined the tribes into cohesive units and maintained territories with organized hunts.  \n\nThere were a small number of [[hill giant]]s on the high peaks and they infrequently left the mountains to hunt horses.  There was also a small family of [[storm giant]]s living near the highest peaks in isolation. The patriarch, [[Abinor Lashingwind]], used his considerable talent to warn off intruders.\n\nDeep beneath the mountains was the [[drow]] city of [[T'lindhet]]. The drow had a friendly trading relationship with the [[Crinti]] of Dambrath and there were several roads into the [[Underdark]] leading to drow city. The main road lead out of the Gnollpeaks south to [[Herath]]."
