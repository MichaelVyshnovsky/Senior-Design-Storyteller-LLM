The Nightmares Hoof was a mountain range located in southeastern Laerakond, near the Dragon Sea. It separated the city of Sambral from the rest of the Windrise Ports.
The Nightmares Hoof was known for its numerous small but active volcanoes, and for the rumors about an extensive clan of fire giants dwelling within the mountains. The mountains were rich in ore deposits, including gold and high-quality iron. Sambrese dwarves founded many outposts in the mountains to mine those deposits.
One of the most infamous mountains of the Nightmares Hoof was Achazars Throne, that was located close to Sambral.
There was a heavily patrolled pass through the Nightmares Hoof that connected Sambral overland to Harglast and the other Windrise Ports.
