'''The Mount''' was a forest-covered volcano at the center of [[Realm of the Mount|the eponymous realm]] of the [[Border Kingdoms]].

==Description==
The Mount was the only active volcano of the Border Kingdoms.{{Cite polyhedron/109/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: First Look At The Border Kingdoms}} While it wasn't prompt to erupt, fume holes vented steaming vapors that sometimes caused individual trees to burn down in flames while letting the rest of the forest untouched and earth tremors known as "grumble-thunder" were a common occurrence.

==Trade==
[[Dwarves]] were known to visit the volcano, paying the authorities of the realm to buy forging time in its secret rifts.

==Inhabitants==
The warm caves on the sides of the Mount sheltered many monsters and ne'er-do-well. As such, fights were a common occurrence in the realm's forests.
