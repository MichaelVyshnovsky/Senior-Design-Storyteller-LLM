The Ticklebelly Hills was a grouping of rocky hills and cliffs found in the Moonsea North region of North Faer√ªn.
The Ticklebelly Hills comprised rocky mounds, large crags and sparse vegetation. The landscape was relatively difficult to traverse, at least for humanoid travelers.
The hills were situated along the southern slopes of the eastern Dragonspine Mountains, north of the Grass Sea and the Giants Cairn.

Stone giants and their saber-toothed tiger pets were known to wander the hills and the surrounding lands.
* Coldborn, a dragonborn druid associated with the Emerald Enclave.
