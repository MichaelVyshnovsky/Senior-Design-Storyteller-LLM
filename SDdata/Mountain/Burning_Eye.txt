'''Burning Eye''' was a tall mountain of the [[Sunset Mountains]].

==Defenses==
Burning Eye had a large signal tower at its summit. Upon being lit, it would alert other settlements.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], the [[Bruenghor Clan]] that inhabited part of the Sunset Mountains were driven out of their mines by [[drow]]. Following their leader, [[Kolgrim]], the [[dwarves]] attempted to light a signal fire on the summit of Burning Eye. They had hoped to alert other dwarves in [[Easting]] to join them in repelling the dark elves. However, upon reaching the signal tower, the dwarves were attacked by the [[white dragon]], [[Ciraxis]], and several other creatures.
