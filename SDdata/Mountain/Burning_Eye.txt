Burning Eye was a tall mountain of the Sunset Mountains.
Burning Eye had a large signal tower at its summit. Upon being lit, it would alert other settlements.
In 1374 DR, the Bruenghor Clan that inhabited part of the Sunset Mountains were driven out of their mines by drow. Following their leader, Kolgrim, the dwarves attempted to light a signal fire on the summit of Burning Eye. They had hoped to alert other dwarves in Easting to join them in repelling the dark elves. However, upon reaching the signal tower, the dwarves were attacked by the white dragon, Ciraxis, and several other creatures.
