Daidake was a volcano located on the island of Tenmei in Kozakura.
Daidake was an active volcano but has not erupted in recent history. Despite this, steam and smoke were constantly rising from the crater and the region around the volcano was spotted with hot springs and geysers.
The only inhabitants of the area were members of the Red Fog cult. The village they established as the base of the volcano was hidden by the many crevices and geysers and was their main base of operations and center of worship. They were known to make live sacrifices to the elemental spirits of the volcano.
