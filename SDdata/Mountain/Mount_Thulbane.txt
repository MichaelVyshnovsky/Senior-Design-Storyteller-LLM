Mount Thulbane was a once-dormant volcano located in the realm of Threskel in east Faer√ªn. Its violent eruption following the Spellplague lent to the transformation of the Realm and the further domination of its dracolich overlord, the Great Bone Wyrm.
It was the highest peak in all of Threskel, Chessenta, or Unther.
The solitary mountain stood high above the flat plains over Threskel, dominating its skyline and lording itself over the surrounding landscape. The Fields of Pryollus lay at the southern base of the mountain.
Although thought to be extinct, Mount Thulbane was merely dormant.
When the Spellplague struck Toril in the , much of the upper levels of the ground collapsed into the Underdark below and sparked geological activity across the lands. Mount Thulbane became active once more, and continuously filled the skies above with black ash that darkened the skies and allowed undead dragons to roam wild during all hours of the day.
According to local myths, Mount Thulbane was home to the god Assuran, the Untheric god of vengeance.
