The '''Trollclaw Range''' was a mountain range located on the island of [[Moray]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The mountains were located in the northwest corner of Moray. They jutted north into the [[Trackless Strait]] and were wedged between the [[Sea of Moonshae]] in the east and the [[Trackless Sea]] in the west. An unnamed river flowed southeast down from the mountain. The ancient [[dwarven]] stronghold of [[Dennin's Delve]] sat beneath the mountains.

==Inhabitants==
The mountains were populated with tribes of [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|10}}
