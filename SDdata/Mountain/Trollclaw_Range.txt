The Trollclaw Range was a mountain range located on the island of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
The mountains were located in the northwest corner of Moray. They jutted north into the Trackless Strait and were wedged between the Sea of Moonshae in the east and the Trackless Sea in the west. An unnamed river flowed southeast down from the mountain. The ancient dwarven stronghold of Dennins Delve sat beneath the mountains.
The mountains were populated with tribes of orcs and goblins.
