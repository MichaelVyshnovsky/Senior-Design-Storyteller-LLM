'''Throne Hill''' was one of the four hills in [[Chult]] atop which [[Port Nyanzaru]] was built. It was located on the southern side of the [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]].

==Description==
Throne Hill was steep, and its top was dominated by the palace of [[Goldenthrone]], as well as a handful of villas. A wide stone bridge atop arched columns connected the top of Throne Hill to the top of neighboring [[Temple Hill (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple Hill]] to the north, while a second bridge spanned above the [[Grand Souk]] to connect the hilltop to the southern slopes overlooking the city, where several merchant princes' villas were located.

The city's [[Jewel Market]] was located around the northern base of Throne Hill.
