The mountains pinnacle was usually wreathed in thunderstorm clouds, but on rare days it could be seen from a distance. From the East Way, a steep cobbled path turned north into the mountain, and then into the Seven-Pillared Hall through the Minotaur Gate.\nBeneath Thunderspire Mountain was located the ancient minotaur city of Saruun Khel near an entrance to the Underdark."
