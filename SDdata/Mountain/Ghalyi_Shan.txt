Ghalyi Shan was the easternmost mountain within the A-Ling Shan range in the Hordelands.
This impressive mountain was part of the A-Ling Shan range. It formed the eastern border of Yarlhang La.
Ghalyi Shan towered over all other nearby mountains standing  high.
Ghalyi Shan was inhabited by a me-zu oni named Gyawa Zangpo, sentenced to live at the small hermitage at the mountain until he humbly carried 10,000 travelers to the top of the pass.
