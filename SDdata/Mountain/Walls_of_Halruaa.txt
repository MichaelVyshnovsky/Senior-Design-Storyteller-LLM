'''The Walls''' were a crescent-shaped mountain range that towered up to 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) over [[Halruaa]], surrounding the country on three sides.

==Geography==
{{Climate/Shining South/Mountains|the Walls}}
Prior to the [[Spellplague]] the mountains formed a natural defense for the realm. The three sections of the mountain range–the [[Nathaghal Mountains|Nathaghal]], [[Lhairghal Mountains|Lhairghal]], and [[Muaraghal Mountains]]–formed a stout border.

Unfortunately, the range's height made it difficult for Halruaans to escape the effects of the Spellplague. Three passes connected the remnants of Halruaa to the rest of [[Faerûn]]. The [[Azhal Pass]] and [[Talath Pass]] were difficult for a large group to travel. Only the wider [[High Aluar]] pass offered a secure route for any sizable group.
