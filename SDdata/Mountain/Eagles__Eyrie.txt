Eagles Eyrie was a rocky knoll just outside the town of Dagger Falls it was noted as a site sacred to the Brightblade clan of dwarves.
A bare rocky hill, this natural lookout point gave a view high over the nearby town of Dagger Falls. A winding trail allowed a rough ascent through sharp, steep cliffs to the top of Eagles Eyrie.     
Eagles Eyrie was once used as a watchpost over dwarven trading routes from the Mines of Tethyamar to towns such Hillsfar, Voonlar, and Zhentil Keep.
At one time, Eagles Eyrie was a dwarven stronghold, keeping watch over valuable dwarven trade routes leading to the Mines of Tethyamar, until the fall of the kingdom of Tethyamar in 1104 DR. Shortly thereafter, in the mid-1200s, Colderan Morn drove the remaining dwarves from the outpost after a perceived slight against his wife, Belesaria.
