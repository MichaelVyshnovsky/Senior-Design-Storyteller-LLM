'''Eagles' Eyrie''' was a rocky knoll just outside the town of [[Dagger Falls]]; it was noted as a site sacred to the [[Brightblade clan]] of [[dwarves]].

==Geography==
A bare rocky hill, this natural lookout point gave a view high over the nearby town of Dagger Falls. A winding trail allowed a rough ascent through sharp, steep cliffs to the top of Eagles' Eyrie.     

==Trade==
Eagles' Eyrie was once used as a watchpost over dwarven trading routes from the [[Mines of Tethyamar]] to towns such [[Hillsfar]], [[Voonlar]], and [[Zhentil Keep]].

==History==
At one time, Eagles' Eyrie was a dwarven stronghold, keeping watch over valuable dwarven trade routes leading to the Mines of Tethyamar, until the fall of the kingdom of [[Tethyamar]] in [[1104 DR]]. Shortly thereafter, in the mid-1200s, [[Colderan Morn]] drove the remaining dwarves from the outpost after a perceived slight against his wife, [[Belesaria]].

==Inhabitants==
*[[Dorn the Grim]]
*[[Elshar Kurl]]
