'''Mount Sklagarra''' was a peak in the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]] of [[Amn]] where the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|Heralds]] maintained their secret headquarters. It was east of the [[Smokespire]] volcano in the far west of the mountain range.

The mountain contained a vast underground lake with an island in the center surrounded by a large complex of caverns known as the [[Swordmere]].
