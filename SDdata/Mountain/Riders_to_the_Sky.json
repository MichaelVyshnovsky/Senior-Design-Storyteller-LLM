        },
        "History": "An [[aarakocra]] civilization had been living in the mountains since the ancient past.\n\nThe rebellious [[Alliance of Chessenta]], under the leadership of the warlord [[Tchazzar]], drove the forces of [[Unther]] out of Chessenta and beyond the Riders to the Sky Mountains in the [[929 DR|Year of Flashing Eyes, 929 DR]].\n\nThe Riders to the Sky became a popular target for Chessentan mercenaries, who hunted the local aarakocra for sport. Their raids eventually destroyed their civilization, sending them extinct by the mid–1200s [[DR]].\n\nIn the summer of the [[1322 DR|Year of Lurking Death, 1322 DR]], the Great Bone Wyrm [[Alasklerbanbastos]] swept down out of the Riders to the Sky and inflicted a reign of terror on Chessenta.\n\n''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], both the kingdom of Unther and the city-states of Chessenta laid claim to the Riders to the Sky Mountains, but the Chessentans were in no position to contest this.\n\nAfter the Spellplague of [[1385 DR]], with the foundation of the dragonborn nation of Tymanther, some dragonborn clans settled in the lands near the southern hills of the Sky Riders. \n\nDuring the last stages of the Second Sundering, in [[1487 DR]], a great portion of the lands of the Tymantheran side of the Riders to the Sky was transposed to [[Abeir]] with the return of Unther. Under the leadership of Gilgeam, the Untherans quickly regained control of their former lands in the vicinity of the Riders to the Sky.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In legends of ancient times, warriors of Unther were said to use the pteranodons as flying mounts. However, their size, strength, and weight made it unlikely that they could carry a [[human]]. Instead, unless larger breeds once lived, the legend was usually deemed a fiction.\n\nA community of [[half-drow]] exiled from the [[Yuirwood]] in [[Aglarond]], long before the mid–14{{th}} century DR, were rumored to survive in the Riders to the Sky, and to live alongside the trolls.",
        "Notable Locations": "The northernmost peak of the Riders to the Sky was [[Dragonback Mountain]], a volcano that had been long dormant. It was the lair of [[Alasklerbanbastos]], the Great Bone Wyrm, and a [[Cult of the Dragon]] stronghold.\n\nBy the mid–14{{th}} century DR, small mining outposts lay on the Chessentan side of the mountains. They usually sent their goods to [[Mourktar]] and [[Thamor]] in [[Threskel]]. The Untheric side was largely cleared lands.\n\nIn the foothills of the Riders to the Sky, far from habitation, stood the former tower of the mage [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]]. The secretive [[Magister]] destroyed it with fire and lightning in the Year of Lurking Death, 1322 DR, in order to fake his own death.\n\nThe ruins of the aarakocra civilization lay among the hills.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Tchazzar]], the great [[red dragon]], had a lair in the Riders to the Sky.\n* [[Alasklerbanbastos]], the great [[dracolich]], had a lair in Dragonback Mountain.\n* The mage [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]], Magister from 1322–[[1328 DR]], had a tower in the foothills."
