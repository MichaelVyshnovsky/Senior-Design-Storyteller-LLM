        "Geography": "Lying west of the [[North Road]] between [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]] and [[Maskyr's Eye]], and extending southwest of Kurth,{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}",
        "History": "In the [[649 DR|Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]], as hordes of [[orcs]] engulfed the [[dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom of [[Roldilar]], the [[elf|elven]] warrior [[Beluar]] and his forces pursued an orc army routed at [[Viperstongue Ford]] into these hills, and won another battle against them there. The hills became known as Beluar's Hunt to commemorate the victory.\n\nSometime around [[1350 DR]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] launched an expedition into Beluar's Hunt. They excavated a hill around some likely ruins of old pillars, supposedly took away some treasures, and discovered an ancient tomb, which they then opened. Then a powerful [[lich]] with the antlers of a [[stag]] upon its skull emerged to slaughter them all with its [[magic]], rending their bodies with phantom claws. The lich then went on a rampage around the surrounding countryside, killing every living creature it came across. Finally, it returned to its tomb, and used spells to bury it once more. The only surviving witnesses were [[mage]]s in Kurth and [[Tavilar]] separately using [[scrying]] spells. The lich still remained in its lair as of [[1370 DR]].",
        "Activities": "A [[bandit]] gang occasionally prowled the Hunt in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but it was otherwise uninhabited.",
        "Legends": "According to local folklore, some hills in the Hunt concealed ancient barrow-tombs, such as the one that housed the stag-horned lich, There were also said to be a number of shallow graves of warriors, dating back to the earliest days of [[human]] rule in the Vast after the fall of Roldilar. These were said to contain buried treasure, but the presence of the lich scared many adventurers off of searching."
