        "mainbody": "eluars Hunt, or simply the Hunt, was a series of hills found in the north of the Vast.\nLying west of the North Road between Kurth and Maskyrs Eye, and extending southwest of Kurth,\nIn the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR, as hordes of orcs engulfed the dwarven kingdom of Roldilar, the elven warrior Beluar and his forces pursued an orc army routed at Viperstongue Ford into these hills, and won another battle against them there. The hills became known as Beluars Hunt to commemorate the victory.\nSometime around 1350 DR, the Cult of the Dragon launched an expedition into Beluars Hunt. They excavated a hill around some likely ruins of old pillars, supposedly took away some treasures, and discovered an ancient tomb, which they then opened. Then a powerful lich with the antlers of a stag upon its skull emerged to slaughter them all with its magic, rending their bodies with phantom claws. The lich then went on a rampage around the surrounding countryside, killing every living creature it came across. Finally, it returned to its tomb, and used spells to bury it once more. The only surviving witnesses were mages in Kurth and Tavilar separately using scrying spells. The lich still remained in its lair as of 1370 DR.\nA bandit gang occasionally prowled the Hunt in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, but it was otherwise uninhabited.\nAccording to local folklore, some hills in the Hunt concealed ancient barrow-tombs, such as the one that housed the stag-horned lich, There were also said to be a number of shallow graves of warriors, dating back to the earliest days of human rule in the Vast after the fall of Roldilar. These were said to contain buried treasure, but the presence of the lich scared many adventurers off of searching."
