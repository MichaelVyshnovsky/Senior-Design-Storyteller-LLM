        "mainbody": "The Stonecliff was a perilous, rocky, craggy limestone escarpment that formed a natural wall along the north side of The High Road. The Eveningstar Gorge, or Starwater Gorge, along the Starwater River was the only route that mounts and livestock could take through the Stonecliff.\nIt is said that once many mages dwelt in caves in or north of the Stonecliff."
