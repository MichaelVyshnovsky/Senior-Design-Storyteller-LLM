==History==
One infamous inhabitant of Mount Angaroth was an ancient, over millennia old, [[red dragon|red]] wyrm called [[Imvaernarhro]], or Inferno. His fiery wrath and awe-inspiring hoard were legendary. Inferno's lair was said to be located on Angaroth's north face, within a cave hidden high up. Sometime before the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], many adventuring companies tried to slay the beast and claim his horde, including the famed [[Hammerfists]]. All failed. In the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, [[Smerdiuk Dragonbane]], the [[dragon]]-slayer author of ''[[The Compleat Dragon-Hunter]]'', embarked upon a journey to Mount Angaroth to slay Imvaernarhro. As of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, he had yet to return.
