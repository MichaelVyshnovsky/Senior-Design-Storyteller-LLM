'''Scarsiir's Crag''' was a mountain in the [[Cloud Peaks]] of [[Amn]], once home to the old [[silver dragon]] [[Eacoathildarandus]].

==Fauna==
After the killing of Eacoathildarandus, the Crag was taken over by a variety of monsters. [[Peryton]]s and [[wyvern]]s vied for the high ledges to use as perches, while [[giant slug]]s and worse things overtook the dark interior of the mountain.

==Geography==
The Crag sat in the northern Cloud Peaks, overlooking [[The Neck (Cloud Peaks)|the Neck]] near [[Citadel Amnur]].

==History==
The mountain was controlled by the [[Dragon aging|ancient]] silver dragon Eacoathildarandus, who laired atop it. He was slain in the {{YearlinkName|1216}} by the great [[red dragon]] [[Balagos]] in order to remove any potential competition from other old dragons in the region. Having fulfilled his mission, Balagos did not use the lair and simply left it abandoned.
