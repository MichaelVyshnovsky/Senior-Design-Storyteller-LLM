Mount Kahdas was the second tallest peak in the Alimir Mountains.
Kahdas was one of the central Alimirs. Its elevation was 7,800 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level. 
Mount Kahdas was visible from 50 miles outside of Almraiven. It had sheared sides facing to the west that&mdashtogether with the similar face of nearby Mount Phevos&mdashwere known as the Eye Tyrant Cliffs.
The carvings on Mount Kahdas celebrated the victory of the beholders against the humans of Calimshan during the Third Age.
