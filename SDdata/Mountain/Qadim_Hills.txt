The Qadim Hills were a grouping of hills in the Troll Mountains of Amn.
These were the western hills of the Troll Mountains, beginning north of Trollford and running until the Greenfields. and some of the waters composing the Esmelflow began atop them.
Goblins used to inhabit these hills, and they warred against the trolls of the mountains.
