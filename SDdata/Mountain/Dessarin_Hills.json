        "mainbody": "The '''Dessarin Hills''' was a grouping of rugged hills in the western stretch of the [[Savage Frontier]]. The [[River Dessarin]] wound its way through the hills, which dominated the landscape on either side. The hills lay south of the city of [[Yartar]] and contained few settlements.",
        "Description": "A number of ancient [[dwarven]] ruins dotted the landscape of the hills. [[Jundar's Hill]] is a prominent landmark at the northern end of these hills, west of the [[River Dessarin|Dessarin River]].<ref>Map of Interior, Silverymoon, Longsaddle, and Yartar included in [[slade]], ''et al.''

ISBN [[Special:BookSources/0-7869-0391-0|0-7869-0391-0]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s that claimed the hills as their land, they were home to savage humanoids, such as [[orc]]s and [[ogre]]s. Beyond these were even more dangerous creatures, namely [[hill giant]]s and [[manticore]]s."
