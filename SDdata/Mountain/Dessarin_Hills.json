        "mainbody": "The Dessarin Hills was a grouping of rugged hills in the western stretch of the Savage Frontier. The River Dessarin wound its way through the hills, which dominated the landscape on either side. The hills lay south of the city of Yartar and contained few settlements.\nA number of ancient dwarven ruins dotted the landscape of the hills. Jundars Hill is a prominent landmark at the northern end of these hills, west of the Dessarin River.Map of Interior, Silverymoon, Longsaddle, and Yartar included in slade, et al. (April 1996). The North Guide to the Savage Frontier. Edited by James Butler. (TSR, Inc.). ISBN 0-7869-0391-0.\nIn addition to the Uthgardt barbarians that claimed the hills as their land, they were home to savage humanoids, such as orcs and ogres. Beyond these were even more dangerous creatures, namely hill giants and manticores."
