The '''Sunrise Mountains''' were mountain range in the [[Unapproachable East]] that formed much of that [[Thay|Thay's]] eastern border. The peaks extended north into the neighboring country of [[Rashemen]]. 

==History==
===Sunrise Kingdom===
In the years after the [[Karsus's Folly|fall]] of [[Netheril]], before [[Dale Reckoning]], a kingdom arose within the peaks of the Sunrise Mountains. The lives of the realm's people were blessed by the wise council and beneficial [[magic]] of the [[wizard]] known as [[Fastrin|Fastrin the Delver]]. When Fastrin was exploring an ancient ruin, he came across a primeval red tome, from the "dawn of time", that detailed the ''[[ritual of Unmaking]]'' which could theoretically end [[Toril|Toril's existence]].

===Era of Upheaval===
Sometime around [[1372 DR]], a group of adventurers came upon a group of nearly-blind, albino [[human]]s that closely resembled the [[Mulan]] people of the eastern lands. Reports stated that they brandished [[gold]] [[weapon]]s that were as strong as [[steel]] and wielded a form of magic that gave off no eminence of light.

A [[1375 DR|few years later]], the [[atropal]] known as [[Xingax]] began creating undead abominations within a manufactory set into the mountains, at the behest of the [[lich]] [[Szass Tam]].

==Geography==
The mountains marked the edge of [[Faerûn]]. The Sunrise Mountains were quite high, towering a good {{SI|15000|ft}} above sea level and were full of old [[Raumathar]] ruins.

A secret realm inhabited by [[gnomes]], known as [[Songfarla|Songfarla the Hidden Kingdom]], was located underneath the eastern slopes of these mountains.<ref>{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste}}

===Features===
*[[Pass of Thazar]]: This break in the southern mounts allowed for eastward travel out of Thay, by means of the [[Eastern Way]].

==Notable Locations==
*[[Fraasz]]: A [[duergar]] city located deep beneath the mountain range.<ref name="FRCG-p223" >
*[[Mines of Tethkel]]: These deep shafts were rich with [[iron]] and plagued by [[kobold]] and [[goblin]] incursions.
*[[Thazar Keep]]: This Thayan stronghold was located in the tharch of [[Thazalhar]] within the southern peaks of the Sunrise Mountains, overlooking the Thazar Pass.

==Notable Inhabitants==
*[[Quickstrike]]: The ancient [[gravecrawler|ancestor worm]] lived within tombs interred beneath the mountain.
