Just to the south was the Vordrorn Forest.\nThis mountain range was snow-capped.\nMany of the same wildlife that could be found in the Spine of the World could be found roaming the Ice Mountains. This included galeb duhr, hoar foxes, ice toads, taer, winter wolves, yetis, devil dogs, remorhazes, and ice lizards.\nBetween  and , the Ice Mountains were part of the dwarven kingdom of Delzoun.\nHumans were rarely encountered among these mountains, other than members of the Red Tiger tribe and merchants traveling from Sundabar. Dwarves often traveled through these mountains in search of the lost dwarf strongholds of Delzoun and would treat strangers with suspicion, fearing they may be treasure hunters.\nIn terms of giants, this mountain range was inhabited by frost giants, verbeeg, and fog giants.\nWhite dragons commonly vied for dominion in this region.\nLegends claimed that an ancient silver dragon roamed these mountains with his bronze dragon companion in the guise of an old hunter and his hound."
