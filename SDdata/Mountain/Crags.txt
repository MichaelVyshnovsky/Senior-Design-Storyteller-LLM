The Crags, also referred to as the Crag Mountains, were a series of hills, broken mounds, and mountains found on the Sword Coast North region of the North.
The stretch of hills and mounds known as the Crags resembled a stitched wound of Torils flesh. These flattened steppes and mounds transformed into a true mountain range as the elevations extended outward beyond its origin point.
In the past, many mines were located within the crags,
The Crags extended northeast out of Neverwinter Wood, situated some ways south south of Mirabar, and north of Neverwinter itself.
The landscape of the Crags was desolate and its terrain was quite harsh. There were however several pools of meltwater found among its upper reaches. Long-abandoned pit traps still remained in the clefts between the peaks of the Crags.

In a fit of rage and fury, the once-slumbering primordial released a burst of energy that caused a massive volcanic eruption and subsequent earthquake. Nearby cities such as Neverwinter were left in a near-ruined state and hundreds of innocents died in the destruction.
