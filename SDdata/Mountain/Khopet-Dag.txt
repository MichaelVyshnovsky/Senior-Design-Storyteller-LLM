The Khopet-Dag, also known as the Spiderhaunt Peaks, was a mountain range located in the Endless Wastes.
Located north of the Shalhoond sat the Khopet-Dag mountain range, most famous for its large number of giant spiders, which gave it its nickname "Spiderhaunt Peaks".
Rocky and dry on the north side, and wooded on the south, the mountains environment was ideal for the many spiders that lived there.
The silk of these giant spiders was highly prized for its use in making clothing and ropes that were lighter and stronger then normal, but also far more expensive.
Yaqubi, people who collected the valuable giant spider silk for a living, frequented the mountains, guarding the secret locations of their web harvesting grounds, and the secrets behind the tools used to harvest the sticky spider web.
