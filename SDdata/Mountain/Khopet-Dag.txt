The '''Khopet-Dag''', also known as the '''Spiderhaunt Peaks''', was a mountain range located in the [[Endless Wastes]].

==Description==
Located north of the [[Shalhoond]] sat the Khopet-Dag mountain range, most famous for its large number of [[giant spider]]s, which gave it its nickname "Spiderhaunt Peaks".

Rocky and dry on the north side, and wooded on the south, the mountain's environment was ideal for the many [[spider]]s that lived there.

The silk of these giant spiders was highly prized for its use in making clothing and [[rope]]s that were lighter and stronger then normal, but also far more expensive.

[[Yaqubi]], people who collected the valuable giant spider silk for a living, frequented the mountains, guarding the secret locations of their web harvesting grounds, and the secrets behind the tools used to harvest the sticky spider web.
