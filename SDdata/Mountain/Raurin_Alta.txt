The '''Raurin Alta''', also called the '''Raurinshield Mountains''', was a mountain range found in the [[Hordelands]] and [[East Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The Raurin Alta was found along the northern edge of the [[Raurin]] desert, separating the harsh wasteland from the sourthern territory of [[Semphar]]. The mountain range stretched east to west for several hundred miles. It was the source of much of the water for the [[Golden Flow]] and thus vital for the agriculture of southern Semphar.
