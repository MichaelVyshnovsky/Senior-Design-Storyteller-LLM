        "Geography": "The Guth Mountains were found in the southeast corner of [[Thindol]]. They held the [[Black Jungles]] at bay from creeping further west. The mountains also framed the eastern edge of the [[Thingulph]]. The [[Dolsel Gap]] passed between the Guth Mountains in the south and the [[Hazur Mountains]] in the north.",
        "Inhabitants": "The heavily forested Guth Mountains were home to colonies of dangerous [[blood ape]]s. A lost city of apes was rumored to be hidden somewhere on the forested slopes of the mountain. The presence of the blood apes drew wealthy hunters from [[Aztul]] who wished to claim a hide to showoff their status.\n\n[[Yuan-ti]] from [[House Jennestas]] guarded the eastern slopes of the mountains.",
