        "mainbody": "El Rahalat, nicknamed the Shunned Mountain, was a lone peak found in the desert of Anauroch. It was named after the Bedine sorceress Rahalat, who made her home within the oasis situated at its base.\nThe mountain was described as having a gray peak.\nEl Rahalat was found in the eastern stretch of the Sword in southern Anauroch, north of the Bowl of Loneliness.\nIn the , the Zhentarim agent Zarud came to El Rahalat oasis in order to solicit the aid of the Mtair Dhafir tribe in Zhent expansion across Anauroch. The tribes leader, Sheikh Sabkhat decided the tribe should move on to another locale to escape the influence and possible wrath of the outlander group.\nBedine legend said that when the mortal Rahalat was slain, the water of the oasiss spring transformed into blood. For the following decade a mere sip of its waters would kill any being that partook.\nIn the years that followed any tribe that made camp at El Rahalat made sure to sacrifice a single camel in order for the water to remain drinkable and not turn lethal again. \nFor a time, the oasis at Rahalat was the home of the Dakawa tribe of Bedine nomads. \nAround that time, descendants of the original herd of goats tended by the mortal Rahalat still grazed upon the mountain and accompanying oasis."
