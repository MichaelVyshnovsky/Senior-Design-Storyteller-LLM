It was said to be a short, perfectly rounded hill. The hill was covered with brilliant red blades of grass.\nA mysterious creature known only as \"the Ghallar\" protected the Knoll from intrusion, but few had ever actually seen the being to be able to describe it.\nLocal legends stated that if one were to eat two blades of the scarlet-colored grass, he or she would be cured of all poisons and would grow ten years younger."
