The '''Dead Stone Mountains''', known as '''Verthishai Loech Ternesh''' in [[Tymantheran (dialect)|Abeiran draconic]], were a range of mountains located in [[Shyr]], [[Abeir]]. The equivalent region to the Dead Stone Mountains in the world of [[Toril]] were the [[Smoking Mountains]].

==History==
At some point after the [[War of Fang and Talon]], [[dragon]]s buried the [[primordial]] [[Petron]], creating the Dead Stone Mountains. Some time later, the dragon tyrant [[Versveshardinazar]] made his lair in the region, hoping to use Petron's remains to create powerful [[magic item]]s.

In [[1400 DR]], [[Caisys]] the Vicelord opened a portal between Abeir and Toril in the [[Tymanther]]an village of [[Arush Vayem]], and hid the [[Old Staff]] within a cave in the Dead Stone Mountains.

In [[1487 DR]], as part of a plan to separate the gods [[Asmodeus]] and [[Azuth]], [[Farideh]] and her allies went to the Dead Stone Mountains and [[Isltan Nyaril]], [[Chosen]] of Azuth, retrieved the Old Staff.
