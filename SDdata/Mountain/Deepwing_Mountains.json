        "mainbody": "The Deepwing Mountains were a small, east&ndashwest mountain range southeast of the Shining Plains in the Vilhon Reach. They were located between the Orsraun Mountains and the Cloven Mountains and north of the Deepwash.\nAt the western end of the range, the mountains gave way to rough, rocky hills known as the Rushing Hills, while the southwestern mountains were known as the Spines of Surkh, which encircled Surkh to the north and east and were home to many tombs and burial sites of the lizardfolk who dwelt there. \nThe mountains were populated with a number of large, flying monsters, including manticores, griffons and hippogriffs, red dragons, and wyverns."
