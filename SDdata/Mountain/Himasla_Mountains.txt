The Himasla Mountains were a mountain range in Malatra in southern Kara-Tur. They marked the southernmost limit of the Kuong Kingdom and separated Malatra from the western and southern lands.
The mountain range was rugged and quite poorly explored, and emerged out of the densest jungle in all Malatra.
Nevertheless, a trade road ran through its foothills. In the midâ€“14 century DR, this was guarded by the Kuong fortress-town of Garuji, whose garrison patrolled the road and fought with the buso of the mountains.
