        "mainbody": "he Umbrage Hill was a hill located a few miles south of the village of Phandalin. There was a stone windmill on the hill.\nThe hill stood  high, with a graveyard at its peak consisting of at least seven old cairns. A northwestern spur about halfway up the hill held a small house and a three-story windmill, both made of stone, ringed by an iron fence. By the late 15 century DR, only the windmill still stood intact with little of the house save the fireplace still standing.\nUmbrage Hill got its name after two feuding dwarf clans fought a pitched battle atop it, and subsequently buried their fallen warriors beneath cairns atop the hill. The cause of their umbrage was forgotten by the late 15 century DR, and only the cairns of the dead remained.\nSometime later during the 14 century DR, the house and windmill were built on the hill. Over a century later, the house lay in ruins and the windmill was inhabited by Adabra Gwynn, a midwife and maker of potions. In the late 15 century DR, Adabra Gwynns home was attacked by a manticore, which had been driven from from its mountaintop nest in the Sword Mountains by the young white dragon Cryovain."
