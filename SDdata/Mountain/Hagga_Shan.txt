'''Hagga Shan''', was a mountain range located in the northern region of the [[Hordelands]] along [[Yal Tengri]].

==Geography==
Hagga Shan sat along the southeastern edge of Yal Tengri.

==Description==
This small mountain range was covered by snow for most of the year.

==Inhabitants==
A small community of [[dwarves]] lived within Hagga Shan, mining [[tin]] and selling it to merchants in [[Sossal]]. The nomads of the Endless Wastes acquired many natural resources from the mountain as well.

Contact between the two groups was rare, so rare that the nomads had a superstitious dread of "little men" in the mountains. The dwarves played on these fears as a joke, and to close deals, only further reinforcing the nomads' fear of the area.
