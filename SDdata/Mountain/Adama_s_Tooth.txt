Adamas Tooth was a lone mountain found in Durpar in the Shining Lands.
The mountain towered over the surrounding terrain, reaching a height of  which caused the city of Huorm, located  to the east, to experience an early dusk each day.
The mountain sat at the northern end of the Tail, forming a natural end to the peninsula.
Snow and ice covered the higher altitudes of Adamas Tooth, but pine trees grew on the slopes below.
Given the high cost of importing lumber from the north, pine lumber was logged from the mountain even though the process was difficult.
The Salipur chaka was active on the mountain mining the rich iron and copper deposits harbored by the rock. The Salipur chaka also attempted to harvest ice from the mountain with the hopes of exporting it in magically sealed boxes, but this venture turned out be a colossal blunder.
A tribe of yeti inhabited the upper slopes of Adamas Tooth, preying on the mountain goats that also lived in the mountain as well as the occasional logger. This was the only known tribe of yetis to be found within thousands of miles.
