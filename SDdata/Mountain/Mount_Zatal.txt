'''Mount Zatal''' was a volcanic mountain in [[Maztica]]. The people of the Valley of Nexal considered it sacred to the god [[Zaltec]]. Mount Zatal was also the highest peak in Maztica, at around 19,000 feet (5,800 m) high.<ref>

==Geography==
Mount Zatal was a volcanic mountain that was just south of the [[Valley of Nexal]]. There were hot caves and tunnels within the mountain that held rivers and lakes of lava and even pools of molten gold.
==Inhabitants==
No humans lived on Mount Zatal's slopes, but the mysterious [[Ancient Ones]] lived within its caves.<ref>

The young [[tlalocoatl]] [[Hokioptl]] also lived in caverns below Mount Zatal, having been sent by [[Azul]] to guard the Cloak of One Plume there.<ref>
==History==
Although Mount Zatal was dormant for many centuries, it periodically acted up. During the reign of the Nexalan Revered Counselor Izco, shortly after the consecration of an expansion of Nexal's Great Pyramid of Zaltec, it erupted, which the Nexalans took to mean that the consecration sacrifice was insufficient, and quickly arranged another.<ref>

Years later, when Naltecona was the Revered Counselor, the omen of the third year was that Mount Zatal belched smoke and ash for twelve days, before a mysterious breeze on the thirteenth day came from the east to wipe the clouds away. In addition, for the seventh year's omen, the snow on Zatal's summit turned blood-red for ten days.<ref> Finally, in the tenth year, Mount Zatal erupted again as Nexal fell and [[Qotal]] returned, covering the valley in ash and smoke.
