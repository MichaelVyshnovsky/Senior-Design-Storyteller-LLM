The '''Sword Mountains''', located in central [[Mulhorand]], served as a barrier between the [[Plains of Purple Dust]] and the rest of the nation.

==Geography==
The Sword Mountains were considered impassable by the people of Mulhorand, and as a result remained largely unexplored. They protected the populated regions of the nation from the storms of the Plains of Purple Dust.

==Inhabitants==
The inhabitants of the Sword Mountains long plagued the nation of Mulhorand, and included a number of [[dracosphinx]]es as well as the descendants of the wizard [[Nezram]]. This mountain range was also known to contain the lair of the [[blue dragon]] [[Gestaniius]].

===Notable Individuals===
* [[Gestaniius]]: This [[blue dragon]] was well known for her raids throughout the [[Land of the Dead]], located just west of the Sword Mountains.

==Places of Interest==
* [[Tomb of Horuseres II]]: This tomb, carved from the stone of the Swords itself, was the resting place of [[Horuseres II]]. It was heavily protected and had never been looted.
