        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, a strange cloud appeared above Suncatcher Mountain and remained there, not budging even when it was windy. Some in Damara and [[Vaasa]] claimed that when the sun was low, they could see a castle atop the cloud. The appearance of the strange cloud prompted [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], then the Baron of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]], to ask his [[Spysong]] organization to gather news about this bizarre occurrence. After setting up camp on Suncatcher Mountain, he soon determined that the cloud was home to a kingdom of [[cloud giant]]s, but rather than report back on his findings, he stayed to explore and perhaps steal some treasure. This prompted Riordan, along with the rest of Spysong, to worry for his safety.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Suncatcher Mountain hosted a [[Cloud palace|cloud-top kingdom]] of cloud giants who kept [[cloud dragon]]s as pets."
