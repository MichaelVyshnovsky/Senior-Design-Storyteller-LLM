        "mainbody": "uncatcher Mountain was a tall peak in the Galena Mountains.\nThe peak was located in the southern reaches of the Galenas near where they met the Earthspur Mountains. It was visible to many in Damara.\nIn the , a strange cloud appeared above Suncatcher Mountain and remained there, not budging even when it was windy. Some in Damara and Vaasa claimed that when the sun was low, they could see a castle atop the cloud. The appearance of the strange cloud prompted Gareth Dragonsbane, then the Baron of Bloodstone, to ask his Spysong organization to gather news about this bizarre occurrence. After setting up camp on Suncatcher Mountain, he soon determined that the cloud was home to a kingdom of cloud giants, but rather than report back on his findings, he stayed to explore and perhaps steal some treasure. This prompted Riordan, along with the rest of Spysong, to worry for his safety.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Suncatcher Mountain hosted a cloud-top kingdom of cloud giants who kept cloud dragons as pets."
