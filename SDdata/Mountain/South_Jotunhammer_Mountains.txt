The '''South Jotunhammer Mountains''' were a large mountain range located on the island of [[Norland]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The mountains covered the entire expanse of southern Norland where it jutted in between the [[Sea of Moonshae]] and [[Trackless Sea]], measuring approximately {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} in length from end to end.

==Inhabitants==
A large number of [[giant]]s and [[firbolg]]s, lead by a firbolg crone named [[Lallargh]], claimed the South Jotunhammer Mountains. Many attempts by the [[Northlander]]s to oust the giants failed over the years. The giants were supported by a clan of [[duergar]] from the [[Underdark]]. The threat of a volcanic eruption within the mountains prompted the giants and their allies to push north into the rest of Norland.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}
