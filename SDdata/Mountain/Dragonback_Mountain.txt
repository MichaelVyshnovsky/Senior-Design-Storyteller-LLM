'''Dragonback Mountain''' was a massive mountain found among the [[Riders to the Sky]] range that lay within the nation of [[Threskel]].

==Description==
The mountain was in fact a long-dormant volcano, within which was a network of lava tubes and dug-out tunnels known as the Bone Tubes. These passageways were lined with the bones of of hundreds of long-dead [[dragon]]s.

==Geography==
It was positioned as the northernmost peak of the Riders to the Sky, also known later as the Sky Riders.

==Inhabitants==
[[Alasklerbanbastos]], the Great Bone Wyrm of [[Threskel]] and Dragon King of Old Unther, made his lair deep beneath Dragonback Mountain. He shared his domain with a grouping of [[brown dragon|brown]], [[green dragon|green]], and [[blue dragon|blue]] [[chromatic dragon|dragons]] of varying ages, along with several lesser [[dracolich]]es.

The mountain's depths were also home to the [[Mourktar]] cell of the [[cult of the Dragon]], devoted supplications that dedicated themselves to the worship of the Great Bone Wyrm.
