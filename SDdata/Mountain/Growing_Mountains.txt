The Growing Mountains were a small isolated mountain range found in the northern regions of the Katakoro Plateau in the Hordelands.
The mountains sat between Nor Tso to the south and the peak of Shan Pi and the eastern arm of Katakoro Shan to the north. The Old Caravan Road passed underneath the northern shadow of the Growing Mountains.
The presence of sheer rock walls made the Growing Mountains an ideal place for the fortress monastery of Punakha Dzong.
