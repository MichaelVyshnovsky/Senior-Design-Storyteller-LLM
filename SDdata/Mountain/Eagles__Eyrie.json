        "Trade": "Eagles' Eyrie was once used as a watchpost over dwarven trading routes from the [[Mines of Tethyamar]] to towns such [[Hillsfar]], [[Voonlar]], and [[Zhentil Keep]].",
        "History": "At one time, Eagles' Eyrie was a dwarven stronghold, keeping watch over valuable dwarven trade routes leading to the Mines of Tethyamar, until the fall of the kingdom of [[Tethyamar]] in [[1104 DR]]. Shortly thereafter, in the mid-1200s, [[Colderan Morn]] drove the remaining dwarves from the outpost after a perceived slight against his wife, [[Belesaria]].",
