A winding trail allowed a rough ascent through sharp, steep cliffs to the top of Eagles Eyrie.     \nEagles Eyrie was once used as a watchpost over dwarven trading routes from the Mines of Tethyamar to towns such Hillsfar, Voonlar, and Zhentil Keep.\nAt one time, Eagles Eyrie was a dwarven stronghold, keeping watch over valuable dwarven trade routes leading to the Mines of Tethyamar, until the fall of the kingdom of Tethyamar in 1104 DR. Shortly thereafter, in the mid-1200s, Colderan Morn drove the remaining dwarves from the outpost after a perceived slight against his wife, Belesaria.\n*Dorn the Grim\n*Elshar Kurl\nfrAire des aigles\nCategoryShrines\nCategoryDwarven locations\nCategoryLocations in Dagger Falls\nCategoryLocations in Daggerdale\nCategoryLocations in the Dalelands\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\nrb8dxwbb2i7pa51n41vkcev8f7njegm"
