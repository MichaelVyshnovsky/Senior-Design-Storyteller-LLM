        "Description": "The Shield was a high spine at the island's heart. It was a relatively straight rock wall that curved to the west. Three small freshwater lakes laid at the mountain's eastern edge. The unnamed lakes were parallel to the Shield and fed by many springs, eventually emptying into a large unnamed [[lizardmen]] swamp to the north.\n\nThe jebel visibly consisted of several types of rock, including [[granite]] – the main geological substance of all seven islands west of Candlekeep. The Shield's rock was soft and easily excavated to reach the abundant deposits of [[copper]] underneath. Copper ore veins were easily detectable by gleaming from the jebel's surface. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Shield bore evidence of past mining – it had shallow mines and small embrasures."
