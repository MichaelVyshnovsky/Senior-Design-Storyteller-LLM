        "mainbody": "he Emerald Crater, or Morndin Vertesplendarrorn in Dwarvish, was a former volcano amidst the Peaks of Flame in Chult. It was sacred to the wild dwarves.\nThe northwestern-most mountain of the Peaks of Flame, the volcano appeared a great cone with its top broken off. Within, the crater was dense with jungle and populated by flora and fauna of kinds that were rare in the greater Chultan Peninsula, and unheard of in Faer√ªn as whole.\nThe Emerald Crater was so lush and beautiful that the god Thard Harr, the Lord of the Jungle Deeps, was reputed to have walked here a number of times. Hence, the wild dwarves of Chult went on pilgrimages here to worship Thard and make their carvings, but left no trace of their passing or occupation, for they held that hunting in the crater or despoiling its wilderness were serious crimes. Bands of skilled wild dwarf warriors would soon attack and drive off outsiders who even dared approach the Emerald Crater, before they could ever set foot inside.\nLairing within the crater was the great wyrm emerald dragon Esmerandanna. Over the centuries, she established a firm friendship with the wild dwarf priests of Thard Harr and even accepted them storing their most sacred runestones within her lair and under her protection. Thanks to their guardian dragon, the Emerald Crater remained one of their most sacred sites, rather than abandoning it in a generation or so as was their habit. Esmerandanna even held a role in their mythology as the daughter, or daul, of Thard Harr.\nThe volcano erupted and blew apart its peak in the , forming the Emerald Crater. Shortly after, Esmerandanna made her lair within the crater."
