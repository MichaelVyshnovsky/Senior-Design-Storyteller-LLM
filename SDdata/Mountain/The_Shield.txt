The Shield was the most prominent eminence on the isle of Raerest in the Sea of Swords, west of the library of Candlekeep.
The Shield was a high spine at the islands heart. It was a relatively straight rock wall that curved to the west. Three small freshwater lakes laid at the mountains eastern edge. The unnamed lakes were parallel to the Shield and fed by many springs, eventually emptying into a large unnamed lizardmen swamp to the north.
The jebel visibly consisted of several types of rock, including granite – the main geological substance of all seven islands west of Candlekeep. The Shields rock was soft and easily excavated to reach the abundant deposits of copper underneath. Copper ore veins were easily detectable by gleaming from the jebels surface. By the late 14 century DR, the Shield bore evidence of past mining – it had shallow mines and small embrasures.
