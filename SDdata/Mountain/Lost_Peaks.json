And they were located roughly  northeast of Waterdeep.\nLocated high on a plateau were the Fountains of Memory, which reflected visions of the past. Those who entered these pools in an attempt to return to those past events were said to be teleported to a random location.\nThese peaks were said to be as old as Toril itself.\nA dwarven fortress once laid under the Lost Peaks. thousand years prior to the 14 century DR, some curse or an epidemic occurred in this area, exterminating the entire dwarven population whose remains were found next to their forge and in their homes.\nIn the late 15th century DR, the Shadovar created a secret village in the Lost Peaks to house their captured many chosen, such as Stedd Whitehorn of Lathander and Samayan of Chauntea.\nMany fey&mdashnotably satyrs&mdashlived near these peaks. A large tribe of centaurs also called them home and kept out any hunters that came from Olostins Hold.\nMany captured chosen were held here during the late 15th century DR."
