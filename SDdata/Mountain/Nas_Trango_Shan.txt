'''Nas Trango Shan, '''or''' North Guardian Peak''', was a mountain in [[Khazari]].

==Geography==
Nas Trango Shan was one of two prominent mountains in Khazari, the other being [[Ahs Trango Shan]], that formed the nation's eastern border.

==Description==
At {{SI|15700|ft}}, Nas Trango Shan was the larger of the two mountains, between which sat the [[Broken Wall Pass]], part of the [[Silk Road]].
