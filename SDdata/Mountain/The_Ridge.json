        "mainbody": "'''The Ridge''' was a long stretch of cliffs that reached from the eastern [[Cloud Peaks]] across northern [[Amn]].",
        "Description": "The Ridge was an exposed elevated fault line nearly 280 feet tall at its center point. The cliffs appeared abruptly out of the surrounding land, and were climbable but challenging. Walking along the Ridge was difficult, as it was a craggy surface and covered with sparse vegetation.\n\nThe Ridge was the most extensively mined area in Amn, Blue-purple [[diamond]]s were the most common gem found here, but some even claimed that [[adamantine]] could be found in the Ridge.",
        "Geography": "The Ridge extended for more than {{SI|50|mile|k|long=yes}} from the Cloud Peaks, running east-west alongside the [[Snakewood]] and separating Amn from the [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Greenfields]] to the north. The [[Golden Creek]] and the [[Vudlur]], tributaries of the [[Splendarrllur]], began from the heights of the Ridge.",
        "History": "The Ridge had once been covered in forest, but during the [[Thousand Year War]] between [[dragon]]s and [[giant]]s the trees were burned to the ground and clear-cut, the event known as the [[First Tethirift]] that separated the Snakewood from the larger [[Shantel Othreier]]. During this period, the heroic [[elf]] [[Tethir (hero)|Tethir]] died while killing two [[Dragon aging|ancient]] [[red dragon]]s who laired in the Ridge, earning his fame as a dragonslayer among elves and dragons.\n\n[[Gold]] and [[iron]] were first discovered in the Ridge in [[575 DR]] by the [[Keczull]] clan, leading to the foundation of the city of [[Keczulla]] nearby. Hundreds of years later, in [[1355 DR]], a simple bookkeeper from Keczulla, [[Pulth Tanislove]], discovered a [[ruby]] mine in the Ridge that quickly earned him almost half a million [[danter]]s. This led him to the founding of [[Tanislove Mines]], the largest mining company in all of [[Amn]]. Fortunately for the many miners who worked in the Ridge, the fault was geologically inactive throughout all of [[Amn]]'s history.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Burrowville]], a village of [[halfling]]s between the Ridge and Snakewood.{{Cite polyhedron/64/Short People|8,9}}\n* [[Giants' Dance]], a stone circle on the southern side. \n* [[Keczulla]], a major city that mined the area was located distantly south of the Ridge. \n* [[Orlsfall]], a ruined mining town located on the northern side of the Ridge near the Cloud peaks."
