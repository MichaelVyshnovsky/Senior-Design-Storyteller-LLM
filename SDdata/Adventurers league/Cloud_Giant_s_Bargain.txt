{{Quote|''The renowned adventuring company Acquisitions Inc. hires you to infiltrate a castle--but not just any castle. This is a flying fortress built by the cloud giant Count Stratovan, who is currently preparing to destroy the Sword Coast. Your mission is to meet with his son, who claims to want to prevent the war and establish peace between the giants and the small folk. If you can learn whether the son can be trusted, discover the secrets of the castle, and... well, survive, you too can earn acclaim with Acquisitions Inc.!''|}}
