{{Quote|''Times have been especially hard on the goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag, and losing the few hunters they have left to neogi slavers will certainly spell their doom. You must delve into the ruins of an ancient city buried beneath the Spine of the World. What secrets lay in the deep dark? Do they promise salvation or doom?''|}}
