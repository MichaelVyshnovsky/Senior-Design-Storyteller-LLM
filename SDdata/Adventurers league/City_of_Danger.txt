{{Quote|''On the southern shores of the [[Moonsea]], the residents of [[Mulmaster]] have eked out a living where others would likely have given up long ago—in a bleak city where corruption is rampant and the Church of [[Bane]] holds sway. In these five short, introductory adventures, you will travel the breadth of the City of Danger, meet its people, see its sights, and witness firsthand how the city truly has earned its ominous moniker.''|}}
