'''''Rrakkma''''' is an adventure module set in the ''Forgotten Realms'' using the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 5{{th}} edition ruleset. It is an introductory adventure for ''[[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]''.

{{Quote|''You stand before the [[Sha'sal Khou]] elders as the most diverse gith hunting party ever assembled. Are you powerful enough to keep the mind flayers from enslaving your people once again?''<br/>
''You'll have to race across the planes to find out.''{{Cite adventurers league/Rrakkma|1}}}}
