        "mainbody": "'''''Breath of the Yellow Rose''''', designed by [[Greg Marks]], is an adventure module set in the ''Forgotten Realms'' using the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 5th edition ruleset. It is part of the ''[[Adventurers League/Elemental Evil|Elemental Evil]]'' series of adventures published for the [[Adventurers League|D&D Adventurers League]]. It focuses on [[Mulmaster]], its noble families and the [[Chapter House of the Yellow Breath]]. It is an adventure designed for three to seven 1{{st}}- to 4{{th}}-level characters.\n{{Quote|''The monks of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose have long cloistered themselves in their home atop the Earthspur Mountains, practicing their strange lifestyle which is rumored to give them longevity. Now, their dietary restrictions and practices of breath control have become the fashion amongst the well-to-do of Mulmaster. But when a few of these lay practitioners start dropping dead from suffocation and starvation, others start to question the validity of the monks’ claims. Is this simply a deadly ignorance, or is there a fell wind blowing through the rich and powerful of Mulmaster?''|}}",
        "Summary": "The adventure starts off as adventurers are invited to a party by [[Aleyd Burral]] in [[Mulmaster]] to help the knight gain support for [[Phlan]]. During the party it becomes apparent that a new philosophy from the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]], known as the [[Yellow Breath]], has become popular among many young nobles. It is also noted that a few recent devotees of the Yellow Breath movement have gone missing.\n\nAs the adventurers investigate this new movement and the young noble converts it seems the Yellow Breath philosophy is not what it seems, with many dubious rites being practiced. Eventually the [[Chapter House of the Yellow Rose]] is explored where the cult's leader [[Thylius Caramitru]] is faced.",
