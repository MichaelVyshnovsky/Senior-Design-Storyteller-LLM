        "mainbody": "Breath of the Yellow Rose, designed by Greg Marks, is an adventure module set in the Forgotten Realms using the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ruleset. It is part of the Elemental Evil series of adventures published for the D&D Adventurers League. It focuses on Mulmaster, its noble families and the Chapter House of the Yellow Breath. It is an adventure designed for three to seven 1- to 4-level characters.\nThe adventure starts off as adventurers are invited to a party by Aleyd Burral in Mulmaster to help the knight gain support for Phlan. During the party it becomes apparent that a new philosophy from the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, known as the Yellow Breath, has become popular among many young nobles. It is also noted that a few recent devotees of the Yellow Breath movement have gone missing.\nAs the adventurers investigate this new movement and the young noble converts it seems the Yellow Breath philosophy is not what it seems, with many dubious rites being practiced. Eventually the Chapter House of the Yellow Rose is explored where the cults leader Thylius Caramitru is faced.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  \nBuildings & Sites  •  •  •  • \nPlanes Material Plane\nRegions \nSettlements \nWilderness  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems \nFamilies  •  •  \nGroups  •  •  •  •  • \nPlayer Factions  Emerald Enclave • Harpers • Lords Alliance • Order of the Gauntlet • Zhentarim\n • \nArmor & Clothing \nArt & Literature\nFood & Drinks  • \nPhilosophy \nVegetation  • \nWeapons  • \n • \n* D&D Organized Play Chris Tulach\n* D&D R&R Player Experience Greg Bilsland\n* D&D Adventurers League Wizards Team Greg Bilsland, Chris Lindsay, Shelly Mazzanoble, Chris Tulach\n* D&D Adventurers League Administrator(s) Claire Hoffman, Robert Adducci, Bill Benham, Travis Woodall, Greg Marks, Alan Patrick"
