{{Quote|''Decades have passed since [[Sokol Keep]] was reclaimed, and a small garrison placed there along with a beacon to help guide ships. Now, that beacon has gone dark, and the garrison has disappeared. In [[Phlan]], rumors circulate that something ancient was discovered in the grounds beneath the keep, dating to before the clerics of [[Tyr]] built the small fortress. Uncover the secrets of Sokol Keep!
