{{Quote|''Bees! The peace of Mahadi’s emporium is shattered as a swarm of hellwasps has descended upon it! Since this is odd behavior for hellwasps, Dara senses a higher power at work and asks you to discover the truth about the creatures’ attacks. Are you up to the task, or will you just end up getting stung? Part Two of the Call for Aid series of adventures.''|}}
