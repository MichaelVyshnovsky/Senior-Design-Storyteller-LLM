Defiance in Phlan, designed by Shawn Merwin, is an adventure module set in the Forgotten Realms using the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ruleset. It is part of the Tyranny of Dragons series of adventures published for the D&D Adventurers League. It focuses on Phlan, the Cult of the Dragon, and the Madame Freonas Tea Kettle.
The adventure starts off at Madame Freonas Tea Kettle, where adventurers are approached by a series of agents from the Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet, the Emerald Enclave, the Lords Alliance, and in turn the Zhentarim. Each subsequent mission leads the party to cross paths with the plots of the Cult of the Dragon and a number of draconic leads. These include a deal for a blue dragon tooth, the former lair of a black dragon, a polymorphed green dragon, a stolen dragon egg, and a map to the lair of a white dragon.
