{{Quote|''Feral-Tongue must be stopped! But without aid, it’s likely that your efforts will be in vain. Among rising tensions, Old Goat suggests an unlikely ally: Chwingas! Her plan, however, isn’t popular among other members of the clan. Can you sway their opinion? Better still, can you find the elusive elemental spirits?''|}}
