{{Quote|''Riddled with veins of precious ore and gem, the [[Earthspur Mountains]] to the west have long been a valuable resource for anyone able to mine them. One such mine has gone silent and the only thing more concerning than its long overdue shipment is the fate of the members of the Soldiery sent to discover what has happened to the mine's workers. Though the mine lay in a region of the Mountains once claimed by a clan of reclusive [[dwarves]], the [[Ludwakazar]] clan wouldn't be so bold as to violate their long-standing peace with [[Mulmaster]]. Or would they?''|}}
