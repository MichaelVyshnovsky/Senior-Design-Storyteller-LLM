At Elventree, Elanil introduces Seranolla the Whisperer of the Emerald Enclave, and Zern Xerkstil of the Order of the Gauntlet.\nThe group then journey to the Underdark via a sinkhole that has recent developed. There they travel down an underground river to Sporedome to ask the myconid inhabitants for directions to Szith Morcane. With the help of the mind flayer, Huum, the adventurers travel to Szith Morcane via a portal.\nEventually, the adventurers make their way to the ransacked Szith Morcane.
