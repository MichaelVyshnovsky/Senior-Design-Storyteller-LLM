{{Quote|''The sages of Candlekeep have come calling. They’ve come to Port Nyanzaru on the trail of a colleague. He came to the jungle to pursue his studies in solitude some twenty years ago, but within the last year, his regular communications have fallen silent. They are in search of brave (and discrete) adventurers to escort them around the peninsula for a health and welfare check. Are you brave and discrete enough for the job?''|}}
