{{Quote|''The yuan-ti have a long, storied past in the history of Chult. So, if they are to be defeated, we must look back into history. Within the jungles, a number of cities fell into ruin during the Year of Blue Fire. Both the merchant princes and factions believe that if discovered, they likely contain knowledge that’ll prove invaluable in the battles to come. Get looking!''|}}
