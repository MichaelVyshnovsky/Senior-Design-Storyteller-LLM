{{Quote|''To fight the despair brought on by the Everlasting Rime, an eccentric dwarf sponsors a fishing tournament she calls the “Great Knucklehead Rally.” The event draws the curious, the hopeful, and the cynical alike. And it also draws unexpected guests that test the mettle of the attendees.''|}}
