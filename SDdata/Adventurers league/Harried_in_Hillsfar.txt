Harried in Hillsfar is an adventure module set in the Forgotten Realms using the Dungeons & Dragons 5 edition ruleset. It is part of the Rage of Demons series of adventures published for the D&D Adventurers League. It focuses on Hillsfar, the village of Elventree, and the Cormanthor forest, and is an adventure designed for three to seven 1- to 2-level characters.
The adventure starts off as adventurers stumble across a madman on the Moonsea Ride, just south of Hillsfar. His ravings prophesy strange occurrences around the city and the Cormanthor forest. Upon investigating the sites mentioned, the adventurers encounter demonic goats, a diseased drow, a disputed spring, an old outpost of House Dlardrageth, and a neglected church of Waukeen.
