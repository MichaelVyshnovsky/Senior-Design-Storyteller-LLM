{{Quote|''Bodies continue pile up, and the [[Flaming Fist]] still has nothing but a name. Thankfully, the perpetrator of the murders has slipped up and the Flaming Fist has captured one of their underlings, in turn, has revealed the presence of a cult hideout in [[Baldur's Gate/Sewers|the sewers]] beneath the city. The Flaming Fist has asked that you investigate. Are you up for the task?''|}}
