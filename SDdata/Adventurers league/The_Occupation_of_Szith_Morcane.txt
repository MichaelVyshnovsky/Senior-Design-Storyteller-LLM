The Occupation of Szith Morcane is an adventure module set in the Forgotten Realms using the Dungeons & Dragons 5 edition ruleset. It is part of the Rage of Demons series of adventures published for the D&D Adventurers League. It focuses on the village of Elventree, drow, and the Szith Morcane, and is an adventure designed for three to seven 5- to 10-level characters.
The adventure begins with the adventurers traveling to Elventree, when they encounter an elven bard, Elanil Elassidil. Elanil asks for help securing a drow she had captured to take to Elventree for questioning. At Elventree, Elanil introduces Seranolla the Whisperer of the Emerald Enclave, and Zern Xerkstil of the Order of the Gauntlet.
The group then journey to the Underdark via a sinkhole that has recent developed. There they travel down an underground river to Sporedome to ask the myconid inhabitants for directions to Szith Morcane. With the help of the mind flayer, Huum, the adventurers travel to Szith Morcane via a portal.
Eventually, the adventurers make their way to the ransacked Szith Morcane. They fight through the new inhabitants to find Solom Nedrazak, the drow archmage leader, being held prisoner by a fire giant.
