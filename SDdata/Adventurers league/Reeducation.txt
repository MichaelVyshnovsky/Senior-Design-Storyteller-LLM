{{Quote|''Hsing bears foul news: SEER has been captured. While exploring the ruins of Ulcaster in search of knowledge pertaining to runemagic (or perhaps even how to create them), they were separated and now the pseudodragon fears the worst. Without SEER's guidance, the efforts of the assembled factions in these recent events may all be for naught!''|}}
