{{Quote|The [[frost giants]] of the [[Ice Mountains]] have long held to the belief that a great [[Jarl]] will one day step forward to unite the families as [[Konung]] (king). With the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] shattered, Jarl [[Ryndölg]] believes that if he can locate ''[[Hartkiller's Horn]]'', a legendary [[artifact]] among [[giant]]-kind, he could be the one. He may very well have found what he is looking for. A great clarion call has echoed across [[Hartsvale]] for two days, and the giants are all marching north. [[SEER]] calls upon [[adventurer]]s to confirm rumors that Ryndölg may have done just that.|}}
