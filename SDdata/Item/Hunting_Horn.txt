Hunting horns were musical instruments in the Realms popular among bards.
These small curved horns produced a sound that could be heard several miles away. They were usually made from wood, horn, shell, or brass.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 20â€“35 gold pieces depending on the material used in their construction.
* Hunting horns were favored by bards and hunters.
