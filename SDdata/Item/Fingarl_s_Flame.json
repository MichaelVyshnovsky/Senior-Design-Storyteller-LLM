        "mainbody": "Fingarls Flame was an enchanted ruby originating in Chult and owned by the merchant Fingarl of Alagh√¥n in Turmish in the 14 century DR before being famously stolen.\nA ruby as big as its owners head, it had an approximately pyramidal shape with its upper point curving to one side, making it reminiscent of a flame or an oxs horn. Thanks to its enchantments, it glowed with a constant red light.\nAs it was too big and cumbersome to be worn as jewelry, the ruby was enchanted to hover in the air and follow its owner just behind their right shoulder. It also produced light, similar to faerie fire with a continual red glow.\nFurthermore, as a security measure, Fingarls Flame would become incredibly hot and emit a deafening scream when moved over  from its owner, specifically, \"from the eyes of Fingarl\". This enchantment was placed by the wizard Thalaskos and was a secret known only to him, Fingarl, and a half-dozen of the merchants trusted agents.\nThis great ruby was once found in the heart of Chult before it was transported out of the jungles by agents of the rich merchant Fingarl. At great expense, he had it enchanted by mages like Thalaskos and it followed him everywhere. Fingarl was even said to talk to it and stroke it, particularly when he was upset about something.\nThat was until Fingarl was found in his office one day, with both his ruby and his head missing! Thalaskos supposed the thief had learned of the security measure somehow and taken the merchants head to circumvent it. Both remained missing as of around 1360 DR."
