However, its actual powers were lost to history.\nAs one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, the dancing harts powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. However, it was later lost. It was speculated to lie among the treasures of Toranu Gang-po, a fortress whose location was also lost by the midâ€“14th century DR."
