'''Baldur's Gatecrasher''' was a variety of whiskey from underneath the city of [[Waterdeep]] â€“ the great dungeon of [[Undermountain]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Baldur's Gatecrasher whiskey could be found on offer at [[the Growling Groghouse]], in a secret way-station deep in the infamous dungeon. Drams of this whiskey were stored in the tavern's cellar. The brewer named [[Woadhl]] died in a keg-related accident while looking for Baldur's Gatecrasher in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
