'''''Spell Diver''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] especially useful against spellcasters.

==Description==
The sword's ricasso was stamped with the image of a [[kingfisher]].

==Powers==
''Spell Diver'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and granted the wielder resistance to magic. Additionally, the sword's targets had a coin-toss of a chance to lose their ability to use magic for 12 seconds.

==History==
Unlike many other magic items, ''Spell Diver'' did not have a long history veiled in mystery and grim happenstances. It belonged to [[Naradon]], a [[mercenary]] from [[Thesk]] who earned his fame for being able to quickly and efficiently dispatch magic-users even when faced with overwhelming odds. Naradon retired due to old age due to excessive use of [[potion of speed|''potions of speed'']], at the age of thirty-two. He died of old age four years later, and his only heir had no use for ''Spell Diver''. The magic sword was sold to an infamous [[cat burglar]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''Spell Diver'' was stored in the snaking chambers of [[marilith]] [[Yxunomei]], inside the [[Dragon's Eye]] caverns on the [[Spine of the World]].
