A stone of magic missiles was a rare magical weapon.
It was a featureless, white oval stone akin to a hens egg, able to fill an entire human palm. Faint sparkles coalesced around it from time to time, soon fading.
Upon grasping the stone, any sapient creature was instantly aware its purpose was to emit harmful bolts of magic, up to four a minute, in the manner of the magic missile spell. However, those who didnt cast spells could only fire off one at a time, instead of four. It could operate up to four minutes at a time, thrice a day if operated a fourth time, it would stop working for about two weeks, or maybe just under two and a half tendays.
Talatha Vaerovree kept such a stone hidden in Castle Endreth, where another Magister had hidden it.
