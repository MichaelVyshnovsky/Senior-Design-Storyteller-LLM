The '''''Shadowhisper''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] black-hilted [[short sword]] that belonged to [[Rolga Stumprock‎]] before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[Weeping War]].

==Powers==
The ''Shadowhisper'' possessed a powerful ''+5 enchantment'' and significantly increased the wielder's protection from mundane and magical dangers. Additionally, the short sword allowed the wielder to cast ''[[invisibility]]'' at will and held four charges of the spell.

==History==
Following Rolga Stumprock‎'s death, the blade was interred along with its mistress within the deepest levels of the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The series of interconnected dwarven tombs were protected by ancient [[construct]]s and magics that allowed people in need to claim the artifacts from the crypts if the appropriate donation was made.
