Icingdeath was the nickname for Drizzt DoUrdens main right-hand scimitar.The sword Icingdeath first appeared in The Crystal Shard but remained nameless until it was called "the newly named Icingdeath" as a side-note in the book The Silent Blade.
The hilt of this scimitar was black adamantite and the blade was made of silver with a diamond edge.The appearance of Icingdeath has changed over time. Since Todd Lockwood began drawing Drizzt, the cat design hilt has gone, and both Twinkle and Icingdeath now look remarkably similar to each other. This is due in no small part to the release of the replica swords, authorized by Drizzts author R.A. Salvatore. Both blades have gone from being curved scimitars to being straight-backed with a tapered point. Both Icingdeath and Twinkle now have Drow or Espruar script written on the blades, despite neither weapon being of drow manufacture, though Twinkle retains the distinctive sapphire in its pommel.
Icingdeath was a +3 scimitar. It had the powers of a frost weapon. When the sword detected or fed on fire, it started glowing with a pale blue shimmer. 
It was also a frostbrand weapon. It also had the ability to extinguish magical fire. For example, it extinguished a portion of the wall of fire conjured by the powerful demon, Errtu and completely negated Valindra Shadowmantles fireball in Gauntlgrym. However, it could also be set on fire in order to harm trolls, though this was only when the magic of the blade was being repressed.This is an element from the game Forgotten Realms Demon Stone, and so this may not be canon. This possibility could just be for the sake of game play.
In the , Drizzt DoUrden, famed hero of the Companions of the Hall, found the blade in the treasure pile of Ingeloakastimizilian the white wyrm, better known as "Icingdeath", and the weapons namesake. The barbarian Wulfgar and Drizzt killed the dragon and found the scimitar after a dramatic battle.
