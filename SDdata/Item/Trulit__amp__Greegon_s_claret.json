        "History": "''Trulit & Greegon's claret'' was the favorite wine of [[Purfbin Doogrick]], a [[gnome]] companion of the [[Hero of Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]. During their quest to untangle many plots against the city of Daggerford, they came across numerous claret [[barrel]]s in the docks. The gnome recognized the alluring aroma instantaneously and regretted that they could not \"acquire\" some. These barrels were traded through the docks of Daggerford via Captain [[Samuel Turgat]]'s ''[[Flyingfish]]''."
