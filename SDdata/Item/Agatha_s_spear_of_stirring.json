        "mainbody": "'''''Agatha's spear of stirring''''' was a large [[enchanted]] [[spear]]-like [[cutlery|culinary utensil]] that belonged to a [[frost giant]] named [[Agatha the Cook]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The ''spear of stirring'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and could magically heat up. When wielded as a weapon, the spear scorched its targets.",
        "History": "In [[1374 DR]], the ''spear of stirring'' was wielded by Agatha the Cook, the aptly named cook of the nomadic frost giant [[Bloodaxe (tribe)|Bloodaxe]]. The giants ventured too close to the town of [[Voonlar]] during the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis and hunted out of a cave not far from [[Shind Road]], feeding on travelers and [[Zhentarim]] troops. Agatha had her hands full with all the cooking and used the spear's magic to instantly bring her [[stew]] cauldrons to the boiling point.\n\nSubsequently, the Bloodaxes were bribed by [[Cheswick Goldwaters]], a [[greater doppelganger]] agent of the [[unseen]], to abduct the wife of the man it impersonated, a [[Sembian]] noblewoman [[Amberlyn Goldwaters]]. The Unseen wanted the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to die rescuing the woman, but instead the hero and the companions slew the man-eating frost giants, picking up ''Agatha's spear of stirring'' from the evil cook's dead hands."
