        "mainbody": "A '''graft''' was a body part of some powerful creature or monster that was merged onto another living creature.",
        "Description": {
            "Creation": "Creating a graft required access to the necessary body part(s) and usually additional resources and/or [[spell]]s in order to confer the full powers of the grafted body part. Attaching a graft (either to oneself or to another creature) required skill as a healer in addition to specialized knowledge of how to graft the specific type of flesh. The procedure was generally conducted in a comfortable and quiet setting, such as an [[alchemy]] laboratory or a temple. In many cases, the secrets of certain types of grafting were closely guarded or known only to a specific group.\n\nSome fiends possessed the ability to bestow grafts on willing individuals, and some [[necromancer]]s developed a ''[[graft flesh]]'' spell that could be used to replace limbs."
        },
        "History": "Some scholars believed that mind flayers were the first to develop the means to graft flesh to another creature, although others argued that a [[fiend of corruption]] had more likely taught the mind flayers.\n\nDuring the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Irritym Wonderstar]]&mdash;a [[wizard]] with ties to the [[Church of Gond]]&mdash;was recognized for the great accomplishment of grafting a still-moving metal arm onto the [[adventurer]] [[Baelam]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a group known as [[Amalgamation]] arose in [[Waterdeep]] who experimented with grafting pieces of monsters onto its members. This included everything from appending claws and tails of [[beast]]s to replacing arms with those of [[sahuagin]] to implanting [[beholder]] eyes",
