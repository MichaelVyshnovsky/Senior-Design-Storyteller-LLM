        "Description": "The function of such gems were to store single [[spell]]s. Specific types of gems could store more powerful spells. Unlike typical spells or [[scroll]]s, anyone could cast a spell stored in a ''spell gem''. However, the more powerful the spell stored was, the more difficult it was to cast it. The whole creation process was kept secret by the svirfnebli.",
        "Variations": "There were several types of gems that could store spells. In order of the power of spells they could store, the gems were:\n* [[Obsidian]] ([[cantrip]]s only)\n* [[Lapis lazuli]]\n* [[Quartz]]\n* [[Bloodstone]]\n* [[Amber]]\n* [[Jade]]\n* [[Topaz]]\n* [[Star ruby]]\n* [[Ruby]]\n* [[Diamond]]"
