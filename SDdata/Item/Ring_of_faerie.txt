'''''Ring of faerie''''' were [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[ring]]s specially crafted by the [[grey elf|grey elves]] of [[Oerth]] that mimicked their race's innate abilities. These were only ever gifted to allies of the grey elves or people they considered to be their closest associates.

==Powers==
When hiding within woodlands a wearer could only be detected by creatures that could [[detect invisibility|see the invisible]]. When on their own a wearer could move far more stealthily. Wearers also had greater chances of discovering concealed or hidden doors and their eyes could see in [[infravision]] out to a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.

Each ''ring of faerie'' was enchanted with an alignment of either [[good]], [[evil]], or [[neutral]]. If an individual was not of the corresponding alignment, then their ''ring of faerie'' would not function for them.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1357 DR]],<ref group="note">While the exact year is not stated, [[Pwyll Daggerford]] became Duke after his father's death in the [[First Dragonspear War]] of [[1356 DR]]. during the ongoing conflicts in [[Illefarn]], a member of [[Korin Ironaxe]]'s [[dwarf|dwarven]] forces by the name of [[Gorn]] somehow possessed one of these Oerthian rings.
