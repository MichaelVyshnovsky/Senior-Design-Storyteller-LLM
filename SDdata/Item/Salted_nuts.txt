'''Salted nuts''' were a type of traditional tavern snack in the nations of [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], and several other places along the [[Sword Coast]].

==Availability==
*The [[Jade Dancer]] festhall in [[Waterdeep]] served bowls of [[salt]]ed nuts, hot [[garlic]] and [[butter]] [[bread]]s, and roasted fowl skewers, as drink accompaniments. The similar snacks were available at the [[House of Good Spirits]] on [[Sorn Street]].
*In the Cormyrean caravan town of [[Waymoot]], salted nuts were served at [[The Moon and Stars]] tavern as a free bar snack.
*[[Daggerford]]'s [[Lady Luck Tavern]] served salted nuts along with sugared breads and [[cheese]]-covered hardbreads.
*[[Blackwater Stout]] of [[Blackfeather Bridge (village)|Blackfeather Bridge]] in [[Featherdale]] put out salted nuts, roasted [[almond]]s, cold [[shrimp]], and [[twist cream puff]]s, for the drinking guests.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, [[War Wizards]] stationed in Waymoot enchanted salted nuts bowls in the Moon and Stars to spy on a newly formed adventuring companyâ€”the [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Swords of Eveningstar]]. [[Semoor Wolftooth]] of the troupe was bewildered by the nut bowl being taken away only to be returned back moments later, but noblewoman [[Narantha Crownsilver]], used to [[Red Wizard]]s' machination, informed the group of the magical spying.
