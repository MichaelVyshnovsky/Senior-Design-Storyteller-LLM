        "mainbody": "Cracker and Whacker were twin morning stars that were the chief weapons of the dwarf Athrogate.\nCracker and Whacker were both gray glassteel morning stars, with spiked metal heads attached to the ends of adamantine chains. The novels descriptions of Athrogates \"morning stars\" are very similar to that of flails, especially in D&D v.3.5 rules. However, in medieval weaponry, the name \"morning star\" mainly referred to the spiked ball head of a weapon, which could be attached to a handle (like a mace) or a chain (like a flail). Therefore, this name and description of \"morning star\" are accurate. Athrogate generally wielded Cracker in the left hand and Whacker in the right hand.\nOn command, Cracker emitted from the small nubs on the striking ball a dark reddish and chalky fluid, the ichor of a rust monster, which corroded other metals on contact.\nIn 1484 DR, Athrogate used his morning stars to smash through the iron wall sealing off Mithral Hall from the Underdark."
