        "mainbody": "'''''Sacred glyphs''''' were one of the three types of ''[[drow rune]]s'', the other two being ''[[house defense glyph]]s'' and ''[[way-marker rune]]s''.",
        "Description": "''Drow runes'' were always limned in black, be it with [[ink]], paste, or inlay. The runes were elegant. The form was always that of female [[drow]] lips that formed a circle out of which eight spider legs grew.",
        "Powers": "A ''sacred glyph'' stored [[magic]] and unleashed it when triggered. The magic was triggered when someone who was not a priestess of [[Lolth]] passed over the rune. One way for a priestess to turn those runes inert for two to nine minutes was to speak a password while touching them. The kind of magic was the same as that of ''way-marker runes'' but included other powers, typically the creation of nine rubbery 20-ft (6-m) tentacles similar to ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', a ''[[shadow flares]]'' effect, a ''[[forcecage]]'' effect, a ''[[sink]]'' effect, a ''[[feeblemind]]'' effect, a ''[[polymorph other]]'' effect that turned the subject into a [[spider]], and an effect that turned the rune into an explosive ''[[fire trap]]''.\n\n''Sacred glyphs'' were used for the purpose of marking and protecting sacred sites to Lolth, which meant valuables like [[magic item]]s or sources of wealth like a [[gem]] node that belonged to the priesthood of Lolth. The only other drow faith that made use of ''sacred glyphs'' was the one of [[Ghaunadaur]]. However, they used it only rarely and when they used it, they never made use of the ''forcecage'' and ''polymorph other'' effects but had a favorite in the ''sink'' effect.",
        "History": "By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the technology to create ''sacred glyphs'' was already old."
