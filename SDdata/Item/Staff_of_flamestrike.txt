}}The '''''staff of flamestrike''''' was an enchanted [[quarterstaff]] that belonged to a [[half-elf]] adventurer [[Faeril]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
The ''Staff of flamestrike'' appeared to be a simple quarterstaff carved using [[birch]] wood.

==Powers==
Faeril's staff possessed the ability to blast a target with divine fire as if stricken by a ''[[flame strike]]'' spell.

==History==
In 1369 DR, the ''staff of flamestrike'' was in Faeril's possession when she ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor, along with many other adventurers, following [[Elminster]]'s call for aid against the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that planned to use the ruins' ''[[mythal]]s'' and the ''Pools of Radiance'' to conquer the region.

Consequently, Faeril, wielding her ''staff of flamestrike'', joined the second band of heroes, who arrived from [[Phlan]], on their quest to stop Kya Mordrayn and Pelendralaar.
