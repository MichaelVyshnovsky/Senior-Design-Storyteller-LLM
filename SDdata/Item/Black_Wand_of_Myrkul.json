        "mainbody": "Black Wand of Myrkul was a powerful enchanted wand that held a piece of Myrkul, the Lord of the Dead, and could be used to return the deity in case of his demise.\nThe Black Wand of Myrkul was created at some point long before the gods death during the Time of Troubles. The wand was wielded by Myrkuls High Priests in the temple under Waterdeep in Undermountain. After the Time of Troubles, the temple was mostly abandoned, with undead guardians left to deter any opportunistic adventurers from pillaging the temple. The wand itself was hidden inside a well-protected vault and stayed there until 1370 DR.\nIn 1370 DR, Khelben Arunsun stumbled upon information of the Black Wands existence and its location right under the Blackstaffs nose. Still filled with hate for the dead god over taking control of his love, Laeral Silverhand in 1337 DR, Khelben seized the opportunity to destroy the bit of Myrkuls divine essence within the wand. He tasked his recently acquired trusted agent to search for the item in the Undermountain temple, a task Khelbenite completed.\nThe Black Wand of Myrkul was left in Khelbens possession, possibly destroyed."
