        "mainbody": "'''''Black Wand of Myrkul''''' was a powerful enchanted [[wand]] that held a piece of [[Myrkul]], the Lord of the Dead, and could be used to return the [[deity]] in case of his demise.",
        "History": "The ''Black Wand of Myrkul'' was created at some point long before the god's death during the [[Time of Troubles]]. The ''wand'' was wielded by Myrkul's High Priests in the temple under [[Waterdeep]] in [[Undermountain]]. After the Time of Troubles, the temple was mostly abandoned, with [[undead]] guardians left to deter any opportunistic adventurers from pillaging the temple. The ''wand'' itself was hidden inside a well-protected vault and stayed there until [[1370 DR]].\n\nIn 1370 DR, [[Khelben Arunsun]] stumbled upon information of the ''Black Wand's'' existence and its location right under the Blackstaff's nose. Still filled with hate for the dead god over taking control of his love, [[Laeral Silverhand]] in [[1337 DR]], Khelben seized the opportunity to destroy the bit of Myrkul's divine essence within the ''wand''. He tasked his recently acquired trusted agent to search for the item in the Undermountain temple, a task [[Khelbenite]] completed.\n\nThe ''Black Wand of Myrkul'' was left in Khelben's possession, possibly destroyed."
