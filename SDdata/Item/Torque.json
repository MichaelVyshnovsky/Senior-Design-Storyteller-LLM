        "mainbody": "A '''torque''' ({{Variant|torc}}) was a style of jewelry worn about the neck.",
        "Description": "Unlike a [[necklace]], a torque was crafted as a single piece, which was attached around the wearer's neck by bending the metal.\n\nTorques could be made from a variety of materials. A simple [[copper]] torque might sell for 5 [[silver piece]]s, but the addition of [[gemstone]]s or extra details in the design would raise the price higher. The base prices for [[silver]], [[gold]], or [[platinum]] torques in most economies were 5, 50, and 500 [[gold piece]]s, respectively. [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold silver torques in style of the [[Moonshae Isles]] for 50 gold pieces. These were crafted with two [[ram]]'s heads, each with [[emerald]] eyes.",
        "Notable Torques": {
            "[[Cerunnos|''Cerunnos' Torc'']]": "This torque was believed to give the wearer dominion over mundane beasts. It had meaning to [[Cerunnos]], symbolizing his former place among the [[fey]] nobility.{{Cite dragon/428/Court of Stars: The Wild Hunt|15}}",
            "''[[Torque of faith]]''": "These torques were sacred to [[Tymora]] and were crafted from gold coins.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}",
            "''[[Torque of the Goddess]]''": "These torques were from the [[Moonshae Isles]] and were sacred to [[Chauntea]]. They protected wearers from [[lycanthrope]]s.",
            "''[[Torque of the titans]]''": "These thick, golden torques granted exceptional strength to the wearer.",
            "''[[Wizard's Torc]]''": "A unique torque that acted as a [[key (item)|key]], opening a passage between the [[Circle of Ualair]] in the [[Speculum Grounds]] to the Elven Catacombs under [[Castle Cormanthor]]."
        },
        "History": "In [[Zazesspur]] during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum]], members of the cult of the [[All Friends]], who worshiped [[Ao|Ao the Universal]], wore simple torques of [[gold]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple of [[Lathander]] in [[Daggerdale]] was burned by the [[Zhentarim]], and a magic torque that glowed and dispelled [[Darkness|magical darkness]] went missing. [[Divination]] [[spell]]s revealed that the torque had somehow found itself in [[Eagle's Eyrie]], in a place holy to [[Clan Brightblade]]."
