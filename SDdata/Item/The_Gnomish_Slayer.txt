'''''The Gnomish Slayer''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[scimitar]] created by an unnamed great [[gnome]]ish [[artificer]].

==Powers==
''The Gnomish Slayer'' was a powerful magic blade with a ''+4'' enchantment. When the weapon was wielded against any [[giant]] or related creature, the ''Slayer'' dealt devastating damage, similar in its destructive power to an exploding ''[[fireball]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
This weapon was a creation of a legendary yet unnamed gnomish artificer who armed his clan with all sorts of inventions and weapons to be used against a neighboring clan of [[hill giant]]s. Somehow, the giant clan was able to capture the artificer and demanded him to create a "gnomish slayer" for them to use against his kin. The gnome artificer did just thatâ€”he created ''The Gnomish Slayer'', slicing his way to freedom. In the years that followed, the scimitar was wielded by many gnomish heroes against giants of all types.

By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the scimitar found its way to the cold land of [[Rashemen]]. It was in possession of a [[Rashemaar]] [[berserker]] named [[Odesya]] stationed in the [[Ashenwood]]'s [[Lake of Tears Garrison]], a Rashemi fort led by a [[wychlaran]] named [[Dalenka]].
