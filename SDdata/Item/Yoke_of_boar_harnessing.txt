A '''''yoke of boar harnessing''''' was a [[magic]]al yoke that enabled its user to harness a pair of [[boar]]s, either normal-sized or [[giant boar]]s, under his or her control.

==Powers==
The yoke could be secured to a pair of boars to enable them to pull an object or drawn vehicle such as a [[chariot]], plow, or cart. It was made of two pieces that could be taken apart, and each piece could be fastened to an individual boar to allow it to be ridden as a [[mount]], again under the rider's control. If the rider was taller than a [[dwarf]] or [[elf]] then he or she could only ride giant boars.

The harnessed boar could also be made to perform a variety of simple tasks, even if not already trained to do so. These tasks were limited by what the animal's natural intelligence might potentially allow.
