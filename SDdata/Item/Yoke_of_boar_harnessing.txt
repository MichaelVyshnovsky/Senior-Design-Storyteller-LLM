A yoke of boar harnessing was a magical yoke that enabled its user to harness a pair of boars, either normal-sized or giant boars, under his or her control.
The yoke could be secured to a pair of boars to enable them to pull an object or drawn vehicle such as a chariot, plow, or cart. It was made of two pieces that could be taken apart, and each piece could be fastened to an individual boar to allow it to be ridden as a mount, again under the riders control. If the rider was taller than a dwarf or elf then he or she could only ride giant boars.
The harnessed boar could also be made to perform a variety of simple tasks, even if not already trained to do so. These tasks were limited by what the animals natural intelligence might potentially allow.
