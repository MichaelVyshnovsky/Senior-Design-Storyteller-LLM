        "mainbody": "The mijayrah () was a basic recorder from Zakhara.\nThese simple instruments were made from reeds.\nBecause they were relatively easy to make, mijayrahs were used by both the urban Al-Hadhar and the nomadic Al-Badia. They had a short range but created a pleasant, breathy tone. Musicians typically hummed while playing a mijayrah."
