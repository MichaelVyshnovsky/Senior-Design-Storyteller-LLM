It was exported as far as the Western Heartlands, the lands along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate, as of the late 15 century DR.\nThis luxury dresser wine was known for its distinct bottles decorated with rings of scales around the perimeter. These thematic decorative bottles were to accentuate Cormyrs trade in dragon-themed items."
