        "mainbody": "he commission and letter of Marque was a binding commission of service to the lords and city of Waterdeep.\nThe bearers of such a document were agents of the Lords of Waterdeep and were granted full rights of passage to venture beneath the city. Anyone that intervened would feel the wrath of the lords.\nThe document was created because evidence had been found of a devious plot unfurling in Waterdeep, apparently taking place in the sewers. In 1358 DR, a group of adventurers were commissioned to find the nature of the danger that lurked beneath the city and tasked with destroying it. The group accepted the commission, which allowed them to keep any treasure they found by right of conquest. The official document was stamped with the lords mark on Marpenoth 5 in the Year of the Shadows.\n* The Heroes of Waterdeep"
