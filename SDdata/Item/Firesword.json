        "mainbody": "'''Firesword''' was a common [[ale]] originally brewed in [[Hillsfar]], [[YÃ»lash]], and [[Zhentil Keep]]. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the drink spread across the lands on the shores of the [[Moonsea]] and the [[Dragon Reach]].",
        "Description": "Firesword was an amber ale and was more of a type of a drink rather than a named product as it was widely brewed by many establishments, all using similar recipes. Because of that, Firesword one would buy in Hillsfar could taste distinct from Firesword served in [[Ravens Bluff]]. The drink was considered to be an \"inn standard\" for its longevity and ease of transportation once packaged and sealed in kegs. Many establishments \"revived\" stale Firesword with [[honey]]."
