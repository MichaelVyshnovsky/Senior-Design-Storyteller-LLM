        "mainbody": "The Stalwart Scales was an enchanted suit of splint mail armor, crafted by the dwarven armorsmith Hedda Perigot.\nThe armor comprised shimmering bands of steel that had been affixed to a leather breastplate. It was noticeably lightweight compared to other suits of armor, and extremely flexible for the wearer.\nThe +2 splint mail offered significant protection against blades and other slashing weapons.\nAt some point after the armors creation, it came into the possession of the dwarven smith Jegg Hillcarver, of Bridgefort."
