The chao was the third-lowest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur.
The chao took the form of a paper note, printed in amounts of 1, 10, and 100 chao. One chao was worth 100 fen or 20 yuan, and was equal to 1 tael, while 10 chao were worth 1 chien.
Being only paper, chao were easy to carry and use, and were favored for transactions of at least 100 fen.
