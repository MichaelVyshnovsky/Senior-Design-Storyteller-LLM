The '''ch'ao''' was the third-lowest unit of [[currency]] used in [[Kara-Tur]].

The ch'ao took the form of a [[paper]] note, printed in amounts of 1, 10, and 100 ch'ao. One ch'ao was worth 100 [[fen]] or 20 [[yuan]], and was equal to 1 [[tael]], while 10 ch'ao were worth 1 [[ch'ien]].

Being only paper, ch'ao were easy to carry and use, and were favored for transactions of at least 100 fen.
