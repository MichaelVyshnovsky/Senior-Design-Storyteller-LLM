Archers belts were enchanted belts created by the shamans of the orcish Kingdom of Many-Arrows.
These orcish belts came with two variations of the enchantmentâ€”regular archers belts, and more potent greater archers belts. The belts possessed magics that made the wearer resistant to piercing missiles and weapons.
Archers belts were commissioned by the King Obould of the Many-Arrows after his orc archers started getting wounded and losing lives to the archers of Citadel Sundbarr. Orcish shamans started creating these belts for the most distinguished archers and warriors of the Spine of the World. The worthiness of the warriors was determined in contests that, with time, became the height of orcish entertainment. By the late 14 century DR, many of archers belts fell into the hands of non-orcs, and were found along the Sword Coast as well as far-away lands of Samarach. One belt could be fun in the Tempests Fury, a magical conclave of researchers, slaughtered by a rogue djinni in the .
