A balldozer, or binphallkahr in Quevquel, was a flying magical transportation device used by beholders.
The balldozer resembled a giant teacup or bowl, about  in diameter. When active, it hovered off the ground and had a translucent brown energy canopy with a circular patch of paler energy, mimicking the appearance of a beholder eye.
When a beholderkin settled inside it and uttered the command word, a translucent brown energy field emanated from the hemisphere and formed a complete spherical canopy. The balldozer moved quickly and protected the pilot, and could violently ram targets with an effect similar to a horn of blasting.
The balldozer was not invulnerable, and could be taken apart with sufficient physical damage. A dispel magic could also temporarily disable the device for a few minutes.
