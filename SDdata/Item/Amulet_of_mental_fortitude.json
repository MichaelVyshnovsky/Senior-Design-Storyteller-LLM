        "mainbody": "'''''Amulets of mental fortitude''''' were a strong defensive [[magic item]] that shielded the wearer's mind. These items were found in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region in [[Zakhara]].",
        "Powers": "These amulets were stronger versions of the ''[[amulet of proof against location and detection]]''. When worn the amulet shielded the wearer from any spell attempting to detect or influence them and read their mind. The amulet also protected against [[divination]] and scrying devices and even ''[[wish]]es''. Lastly, the amulet protected against all [[psionic]] or telepathic attacks, but it also prevented the wearer from using similar powers."
