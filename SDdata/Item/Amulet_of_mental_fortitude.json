        "mainbody": "Amulets of mental fortitude were a strong defensive magic item that shielded the wearers mind. These items were found in the Cities of the Ancients region in Zakhara.\nThese amulets were stronger versions of the amulet of proof against location and detection. When worn the amulet shielded the wearer from any spell attempting to detect or influence them and read their mind. The amulet also protected against divination and scrying devices and even wishes. Lastly, the amulet protected against all psionic or telepathic attacks, but it also prevented the wearer from using similar powers."
