        "mainbody": "The '''''Viper Fang''''' was the [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] that dripped with [[poison]] akin to an actual fang of a [[viper]].",
        "Description": "The ''Viper Fang'' was unassuming in appearance apart from the always wet edge of the dagger's blade that constantly exuded extremely potent venom or poison.",
        "Powers": "This dagger possessed a ''3'' enchantment. Additionally, it was coated in strong magically generating poison. When this poison was introduced into a target's bloodstream, it started weakening them, withering the creatures' muscles. Just several shallow cuts could easily bring down even the lightest warriors.",
        "History": "In [[1373 DR]], the ''Viper Fang'' could be found in the [[Moonsea]] region, the vicinity of [[Elventree]]."
