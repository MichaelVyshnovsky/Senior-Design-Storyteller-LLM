'''''Staves of the tutor''''' were [[enchanted]] [[wizard]]s' [[staves]] used by nefarious organizations across the Realms as well as an occasional arcane teacher when faced with especially unruly student.

==Powers==
These teachers' staves were enhanced with a ''+1'' enchantment that also increased the wielder's charisma and intelligence. Additionally, if a ''staff of the tutor'' was used to strike someone, it flashed with blue glow that casted the ''[[Blindness or deafness|blindness and deafness]]'' spells on the target. A typical staff held fifty charges of that spell.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century, these staves could be found in the hands of nefarious organizations that employed wizards, such as the notorious [[Zhentarim]]. But they also were sometimes used by wizards who taught the ''Art'' to disobedient youths.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Zalazar Oram]]: an evil wizard from the [[Moonsea]] region also known as " the Hellspell" in [[1373 DR]].
