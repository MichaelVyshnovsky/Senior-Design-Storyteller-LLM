'''''Bastion''''' was a magical [[tower shield]] kept at the [[Old Man's Face]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
==Powers==
The shield was extremely large and heavy, and bore enhancements that made it surprisingly adept as a bashing weapon. It also performed admirably in the role of actually protecting the bearer.

==History==
''Bastion'' was forged on a distant plane, rather than the [[Prime Material plane]], and saw many battles in its life. It somehow ended up in the possession of [[Branson Blackboot]], the corrupt innkeeper of the Old Man's Face inn, and may have been seized by the [[Harpers]] when they searched the inn for a fragment of the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'' that was hidden there.
