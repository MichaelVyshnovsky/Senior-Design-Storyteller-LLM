A '''''Heward's handy haversack''''' was a magic [[backpack]] that offered three compartments of extradimensional storage space.

==Description==
The ''haversack'' looked like an ordinary backpack and always weighed {{SI|5|lbs.|k|long=yes}} regardless of its contents.

==Powers==
The backpack contained two side pouches that could hold up to {{SI|20|lbs.|k|long=yes}} at a maximum volume of 2 cubic feet (56.6 l) each, as well as a main compartment capable of storing up to {{SI|80|lbs.|k|long=yes}} at a maximum volume of 8 cubic feet (226 l). If overloaded or damaged, the ''haversack'' was destroyed, its contents lost forever.

As with many other magic storage objects such as ''[[Bag of holding|bags of holding]]'' or ''[[portable hole]]s'', placing a ''Heward's handy haversack'' inside the extradimensional space created by one of such items destroyed both and opened a temporary [[portal]] into the [[Astral Plane]] that pulled through it any creature within 10 ft (3 m) of it.
