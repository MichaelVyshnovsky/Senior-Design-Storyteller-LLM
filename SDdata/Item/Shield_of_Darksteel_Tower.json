        "mainbody": "'''''Shields of Darksteel Tower''''' were [[enchanted]] [[tower shield]]s that were once in the hands of a group of surface-dwelling [[drow]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "This [[darksteel]] tower shield was enchanted with a potent ''+2'' defensive magic. When used to defend against individuals and creatures that followed and embodied good, these shields became as powerful as a ''+4'' defensive enchantment.",
        "History": "''Shields of Darksteel Tower'' originated in the infamous [[Darksteel Tower]] that stood looming over the surface of [[Faer√ªn]] some years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. This tower was briefly lorded over by a vicious coven of surface drow elves. The tower was tirelessly guarded by black [[cotton]]-shrouded high priestesses at all hours of the day. The location of the evil drow was eventually discovered by the [[Harpers]] and, after a long struggle, the Darksteel Tower was destroyed. The ''Shields of Darksteel Tower'' were all that was left from the fallen tower, undamaged by Harper weapons and spells.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century DR, several of the ''shields of Darksteel Tower'' could be found on the [[Sword Coast North]] in [[Neverwinter]], the Jewel of the North, and as far as the eastern nation of [[Rashemen]] and its city of [[Mulsantir]]."
