        "History": "''Bloodstone double axe'' belonged to the [[Bloodstone (mercenaries)|Bloodstone]] mercenary group ''circa'' [[1090 DR]]. The history remembered this particular company for their attempted participation in the [[Battle of the Bones]] of 1090 DR. The mercenaries outfitted themselves, sparing no expanse for the battle. However, the ship that transported the Bloodstones from [[Tethyr]] was swarmed and sank. This dread double axe remained on the very few reminders of their existence.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], the ''Bloodstone double axe'' was in the hands of the leader of the [[Bloodaxe (tribe)|Bloodaxe]]. After his death, however, the axe's whereabouts remained unclear.",
