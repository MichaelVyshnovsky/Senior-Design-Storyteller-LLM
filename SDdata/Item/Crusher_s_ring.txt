Crushers ring was an enchanted ring that belonged to a goblin named Crusher, a member of the Cult of the Absolute circa 1492 DR.
Crushers ring was a simple golden band with a single green gem affixed to it. While it was in Crushers possession, the ring was covered with filth and grime, yet managed to exude a faint aroma of lavender.
Crushers ring possessed a simple enchantment that increased the wearers movement speed.
In 1492 DR, Crushers ring was worn on one of Crushers filthy toes. While the Cult of the Absolute was based in the Shattered Sanctum, a ruined temple of Sel√ªne, Crusher was drunk on alcohol and power, under the leadership of the Absolute. Following successful raids, Crusher felt superior to other races and demanded them to kiss his filthy toes with Crushers ring on one of them.
