Bolas were an exotic ranged weapon.
A set of bolas consisted of two or three spheres, or a lightly barbed chain.
Bolas were held at the connecting point and twirled in a circle high enough that the ground could not interfere. They were then released and thrown at a target, with the intention that they would entangle and wrap themselves around the legs of the opponent, causing them to trip. This primarily worked on bipedal creatures, though it was possible to achieve this effect on quadrupedal creatures as well.
Because they required a lot of skill and practice to use effectively, bolas were classified by many as an exotic weapon.
Almost any weaponsmith or leatherworker was capable of crafting a set of bolas, though they required exact measurements and weights for the cords and balls respectively.
