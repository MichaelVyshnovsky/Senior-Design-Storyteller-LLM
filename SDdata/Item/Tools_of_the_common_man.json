        "mainbody": "The tools of the common man were a trio of legendary Chauntea-blessed farmers tools-turned-weapons from the small settlement of Cuardin on Gwynneth. Among their number were Shods shepherd staff, Gabes shovel, and Borics pitchfork.\nThe tools of the common man resembled normal farmers tools, each imprinted with an image of grain on their handles.\nAlready effective weapons in their own right, when used together, the tools of the common man supernaturally improved the morale of those who fought on their side of any conflict.\nThe tools of the common man could typically only be wielded in defense of home and family, or other just causes. They could also only be used by those with good in their heart or those who advanced the cause of neutrality.\nSometime between the  and the , in an age when Myth Drannor had not yet fallen and the Northlanders regularly raided Ffolk settlements throughout the Moonshae Isles, a small crack force of Northlander troops made their way towards Myrloch Vale in search of its rumored riches. Although most of Gwynneths forces were occupied with scuffles elsewhere, the population of Cuardin, a small farming community adjoining a surrounding forest of the Vale, spotted the advancing raiders.\nInspired by the speech of a goat herder named Shod, the farmers decided to repay Chauntea for their consistently bountiful harvests, and wielded their tools in preparation for a battle they expected to lose. However, their act of devotion came to the attention of their goddess, who decided to assist her faithful in this conflict. This assistance manifested as three birds of prey, each holding a piece of grain a hawk with rye, an owl with alfalfa, and an eagle with wheat.\nShortly before the battle commenced, these three birds descended, dropping their pieces of grain on three farmers tools. The hawk dropped its rye on a shovel wielded by the powerful but quiet Gabe, the owl dropped its alfalfa on a pitchfork in the hands of the old stable worker Boric, and the eagle dropped its wheat on Shods shepherd staff. Empowered by these blessed weapons, the farmers managed to defeat the raiding Northlanders with only some casualties."
