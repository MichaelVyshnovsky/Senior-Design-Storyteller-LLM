        "mainbody": "he ring of hardened magma was a relic sacred to the Black Raven tribe of Uthgardt . It was located within their ancestral mound of Raven Rock, in the Spine of the World mountains.\nAs its name states, the ring was formed of magma that had hardened in a circular form. It was sized to fit the finger of a giant.\nIf an individual attuned to it, the ring shone with orange radiance and, if necessary, changed its size to fit their hand.\nThe ring of hardened magma possessed six charges. Once per day, the wielder could expend a charge to cast the spell conjure minor elementals or the warm version of fire shield."
