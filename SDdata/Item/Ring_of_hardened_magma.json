        "mainbody": "The '''''ring of hardened magma''''' was a [[relic]] sacred to the [[Black Raven tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] . It was located within their [[ancestral mound]] of [[Raven Rock]], in the [[Spine of the World]] mountains.",
        "Description": "As its name states, the ring was formed of magma that had hardened in a circular form. It was sized to fit the finger of a [[giant]].\n\nIf an individual [[Attunement|attuned]] to it, the ring shone with orange radiance and, if necessary, changed its size to fit their hand.",
        "Powers": "The ''ring of hardened magma'' possessed six charges. Once per day, the wielder could expend a charge to cast the [[spell]] ''[[conjure minor elementals]]'' or the ''warm'' version of ''[[fire shield]]''."
