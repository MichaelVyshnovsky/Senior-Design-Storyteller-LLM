Oil of invisibility was a magical substance that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider and the bottom than they were at the top.
When smeared on an item or individual, this oil caused the coated surface to completely disappear. This effect last for 1â€“2 hours.
Though anything coated with this oil was invisible to the naked eye, the oil gave off a distinct scent that was easily tracked by most dogs or other creatures with an acute sense of smell.
