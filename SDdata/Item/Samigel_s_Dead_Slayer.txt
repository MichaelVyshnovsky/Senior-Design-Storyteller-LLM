Samigels Dead Slayer was a magic bludgeon effective against the undead.
Samigels Dead Slayer was a club made of wood and bound in silver.
The Dead Slayer had a +4 enchantment placed upon it that also significantly improved the wielders reflexes. When used against undead creatures, this bludgeon effectively became a +7 enchanted weapon. Additionally, this club allowed the user to cast the protection from evil spell on themselves.
In 1369 DR, Samigels Dead Slayer was one of the artifacts scavenged from the Elven Catacombs by the drow of House Freth. This enchanted club was deposited in one of the chests in the makeshift prison area used by the drow and their Cult of the Dragon allies.
