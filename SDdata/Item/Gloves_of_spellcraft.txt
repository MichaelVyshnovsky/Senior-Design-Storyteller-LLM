Gloves of spellcraft were enchanted gloves that fortified the wearers ability to weave spells.
These magic gloves allowed the wearer to be able to weave and recognize complex spells during magic battles. They were designed to be used by wizards, sorcerers, druids, and clerics. Two stronger variants were also created greater gloves of spellcraft and epic gloves of spellcraft.
Gloves of spellcraft were developed by the Red Wizards of Thay as a tool to stave off the expansion of the Mulhorandi theocracy. These gloves were a personal project of several Red Wizards who remained unnamed. They assisted the magocracy of Unther by providing them with gloves of spellcraft. Despite the gloves being useful, Mulhorand still dominated the struggle because of its dramatically higher numbers.
