'''''Gloves of spellcraft''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves that fortified the wearer's ability to weave [[spell]]s.

==Powers==
These magic gloves allowed the wearer to be able to weave and recognize complex spells during magic battles. They were designed to be used by [[wizard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[druid]]s, and [[cleric]]s. Two stronger variants were also created: ''greater gloves of spellcraft'' and ''epic gloves of spellcraft''.

==History==
''Gloves of spellcraft'' were developed by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] as a tool to stave off the expansion of the Mulhorandi theocracy. These gloves were a personal project of several Red Wizards who remained unnamed. They assisted the magocracy of [[Unther]] by providing them with ''gloves of spellcraft''. Despite the gloves being useful, Mulhorand still dominated the struggle because of its dramatically higher numbers.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Shamal]], a [[djinni]] who took over the tower of the [[Tempest's Fury]] in the hidden nation of [[Samarach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
