Wands of heal were magic wands, usable by clerics, paladins, and rangers, allowing the wielder to heal and cure its targets from a variety of ailments.
Wands of heal were shaped rods of slender bleached hardwood.
These enchanted items allowed the wielder access to a powerful version of heal spell that not only cured serious wounds, but also removed harmful conditions such as blindness, deafness, poison, and others. An average wand held at least four charges.
In 1369 DR, one of these wands was carried by walking undead creatures spawned by a mad lich Thyaast Ammath, a survivor of the Weeping War, who laired in the deepest parts of the Elven Catacombs, not far from a chasm that led into the Underdark.
