'''''Wands of heal''''' were magic [[wand]]s, usable by [[cleric]]s, [[paladin]]s, and [[ranger]]s, allowing the wielder to heal and cure its targets from a variety of ailments.

==Description==
''Wands of heal'' were shaped rods of slender bleached hardwood.

==Powers==
These [[enchanted]] items allowed the wielder access to a powerful version of ''[[heal]]'' spell that not only cured serious wounds, but also removed harmful conditions such as blindness, deafness, poison, and others. An average wand held at least four charges.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], one of these wands was carried by walking [[undead]] creatures spawned by a mad [[lich]] [[Thyaast Ammath]], a survivor of the [[Weeping War]], who laired in the deepest parts of the [[Elven Catacombs]], not far from a chasm that led into the [[Underdark]].
