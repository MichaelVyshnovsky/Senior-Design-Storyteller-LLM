        "mainbody": "tessadyle robe was a psionically active article of clothing that was made from the fibers of the tessadyle fungus and was often produced by the Creative Creed of mind flayers.\nThe robe could be worn by races other than just mind flayers, but since mind flayers created them, it would have made illithids curious about why a non-illithid possessed one.\nWhen a robe was put on, the wearer would notice that the robe would adjust to their height, width, and even their stride. Because of this, it improved ones ability to dodge attacks. Beyond this, the robe also conferred body equilibrium, body weaponry, and cell adjustment once each per day by utilizing psionic energy. The last was only usable on the wearer.\nWhen body equilibrium was utilized, it lengthened and stiffened, and allowed the user to go over normally impassable objects. It also assisted in slowing a users fall since the robes would swell up much like a balloon and cause the user to float harmlessly to the ground.\nWhen body weaponry was utilized, the sleeves would shoot out and wind together into the wearers choice of weapons.\nWhen cell adjustment was utilized, the robe would squeeze tight to the users body, and pulse with psionic energy as it healed wounds and cured diseases from the wearer.\nIt was often supplied to illithid sentinels in major tunnels that led into Oryndoll."
