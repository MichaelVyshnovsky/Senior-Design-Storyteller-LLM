'''Bread''' was available in a number of forms on [[Toril]]. Every culture on the planet was known for producing one or more specific types of bread, which resulted in an enormous variety.

{{quote|''I like bread. Especially [[herb bread]]. Though I'm also very fond of [[sweet roll]]s with [[raisin]]s. Herb bread is good with little bits of [[cheese]] baked into it. Though not necessarily with [[stew]]. With stew, you want a plain bread you can use to sop up the [[gravy]]. One with a lot of bite to the crust, but soft inside. Of course, [[berry pie]] is always good.''|[[Emilo Haversack]]}}

==History==
The nomadic [[Bedine]] and the [[Nexalan]]s were known to produce their own varieties of bread.

Bread was often expensive in the nation of [[Calimshan]] due to their severe shortages of grain.

==Reputation==
Bread was sometimes considered the staple meal of the [[god]]s, as much as [[wine]] was considered their nectar.
