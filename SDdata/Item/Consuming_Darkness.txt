Consuming Darkness was a magical ring found in Cormyr in the mid-1480s DR.
Despite being made of gold, the ring appeared as if a completely black silhouette, shedding or reflecting no light at all.
Consuming Darkness granted the wearer an increased ability in the fields of discombobulating and assassinating their targets.
The ring was taken from the treasury of the Shadovar Archwizard Amskars flying glacier enclave by Cormyrean forces as they attacked it. The battle destroyed the enclave and the army upon it, but Consuming Darkness was one of the treasures recovered intact.
