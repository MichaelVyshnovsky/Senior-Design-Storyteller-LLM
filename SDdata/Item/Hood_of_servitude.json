        "mainbody": "he hood of servitude was a magical animal hood that originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis item looked like a regular falcon hood.\nWhen placed upon the head of any flying creature, the hood of servitude charmed the creature so that it would loyally serve the owner of the hood. The hood would instantly grow or shrink to fit the head of the creature. This hoods magic worked on avians as well as other flying creatures such as dragons and even the mighty Zakharan rocs. The hood never failed to charm when used against natural animals, but intelligent creatures did have a chance to resist the hoods magic."
