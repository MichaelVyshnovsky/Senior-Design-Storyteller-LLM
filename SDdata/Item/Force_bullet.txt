'''''Force bullets''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[sling]] missile designed to restrain rather than to harm.

==Powers==
''Force bullets'' possessed an enchantment that made them easier to strike their targets and slightly boosted their damage output. However, their magic's value become apparent once a ''force bullet'' hits its target. Upon collision, the bullets released the ''[[Otiluke's resilient sphere]]'', enclosing the target within for 42 seconds.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''force bullets'' were popular weapons among the clergies of [[Helm]], [[Eldath]], and [[Ilmater]]. Grand Syndar [[Quinn Silverfinger]], a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] was amongst the users during his tenure at [[The Golden Lodge]] of [[Lonelywood]] in the late 13{{th}} and early 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].
