The '''''armor of the glacier''''' was a [[magic]]al set of [[armor]].

==Powers==
This set of armor had a ''+1'' enchantment. Whoever wore the armor gained resistance to [[fire]]. In addition, attacks from fire-based monsters (such as [[efreeti]] and [[fire giants]]) did half as much damage as normal to the wearer of ''armor of the glacier''.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], a knight of [[Tuern]] called [[Kestutis]] was tied up by a group of pirates. He was rescued by the [[Heroes of Ascore]], and in return, he gifted the heroes the armor he wore during his service, the ''armor of the glacier''.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Kestutis]]
* The [[Heroes of Ascore]]
