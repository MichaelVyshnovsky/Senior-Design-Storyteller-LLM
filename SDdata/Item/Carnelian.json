        "mainbody": "arnelian, also known as sard, was a semi-precious stone found in the Realms.\nCarnelian was a variety of chalcedony that had a clear, orange to red to reddish-brown hue. It was typically cut cabochon and polished to a glossy finish, but could also be tumbled to smooth, rounded stones. Because of its bright color, it was primarily used for jewelry and decoration. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.\nThis gemstone was used in the crafting of cubic gates, luckstones, and in the creation of devices that offered protection from evil or from bodily harm. Carrying or wearing a carnelian generally improved the owners luck by a small amount. A properly prepared and enchanted carnelian could be sacrificed in dire need to gain a second chance at some failed feat of strength, ability, or survival. The person had to immediately touch the special stone, which then disappeared in a flash of bright light, and try again.\nIn the city of Mezro in Chult, some wizards crafted small enchanted carnelian stones, covered in countless magical runes. When the stone was put on ones tongue, it melted like elven candy, although it tasted heinous, like orcish goulash. This enchanted game gave the imbiber the ability to speak and understand the Tabaxi language for three days.\nDreaming about, or having visions of carnelians was considered an omen of misfortune by many seers and oracles.\n* The Heart of the Lion was a huge specimen and a holy relic of Hajama in the land of Zakhara.\n* One of the nine jewels of Neverwinter was a carnelian. Its special powers included being able to cast blade barrier twice a day and the ability to block, reflect, or redirect any casting of wall of fire."
