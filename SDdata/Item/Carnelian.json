        "mainbody": "'''Carnelian''', also known as '''[[wikipedia:en:sard|sard]]''', was a [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] found in the Realms.",
        "Description": "Carnelian was a variety of [[chalcedony]] that had a clear, orange to red to reddish-brown hue. It was typically cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]] and polished to a glossy finish, but could also be tumbled to smooth, rounded stones. Because of its bright color, it was primarily used for jewelry and decoration. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.",
        "Powers": "This gemstone was used in the crafting of ''[[cubic gate]]s'', ''[[luckstone]]s'', and in the creation of devices that offered ''[[protection from evil]]'' or from bodily harm. Carrying or wearing a carnelian generally improved the owner's luck by a small amount. A properly prepared and enchanted carnelian could be sacrificed in dire need to gain a second chance at some failed feat of strength, ability, or survival. The person had to immediately touch the special stone, which then disappeared in a flash of bright light, and try again.\n\nIn the city of [[Mezro]] in [[Chult]], some [[wizard]]s crafted small enchanted carnelian stones, covered in countless magical runes. When the stone was put on one's tongue, it melted like [[elf|elven]] [[candy]], although it tasted heinous, like [[orc|orcish]] [[goulash]]. This enchanted game gave the imbiber the ability to speak and understand the [[Tabaxi language]] for three days.{{Template:Cite book/The Ring of Winter|201|11}}",
        "Reputation": "Dreaming about, or having visions of carnelians was considered an omen of misfortune by many seers and oracles.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}",
        "Notable Specimens": "* The [[Heart of the Lion]] was a huge specimen and a holy relic of [[Hajama]] in the land of [[Zakhara]].{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|27}}\n* One of the ''[[nine jewels of Neverwinter]]'' was a carnelian. Its special powers included being able to cast ''[[blade barrier]]'' twice a day and the ability to block, reflect, or redirect any casting of ''[[wall of fire]]''."
