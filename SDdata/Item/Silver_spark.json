        "mainbody": "Silver spark was a poison sometimes used by holy slayer assassins of the Soft Whisper in Zakhara.\nThis poison was a radiant vapor. Rumor stated that is was derived from distilled moonlight and bottled passion. It possessed a rich and musky aroma.\nVictims could not resist breathing deeply of this perfumed poison once a holy slayer offered it. Once inhaled, intense pain wracked the victims body for several intense minutes."
