Finchs comfortable cap was just one of many enchanted hats worn by the daring half-elven bard Finch in the late 14 century DR.
Despite the headwear being nowhere as well-ensorcelled as his previous hats, Finch still developed an attachment to this fanciful floppy-sided cap. It did possess a minor enchantment that slightly boosted the wearers physical health and constitution and improved their evasion. The hats custom enchantments made it impossible to be worn by anyone who was not a half-elven bard.
