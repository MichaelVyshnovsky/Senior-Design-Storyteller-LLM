A Branch of Giving was an enchanted unwilting sapling usable by druids and rangers.
Natures magic was channeled through a Branch of Giving, keeping it green and alive without having to be planted into the earth. A druid or a ranger could will the sapling to grow two flameberries or two iceberries once per day each. To no surprise, flameberries harnessed magical power of fire and iceberries – of cold. These berries could be fed to an animal companion to grant them special abilities temporarily. Berries of ice granted them powers and resistances of winter and berries of flame – powers and resistances of fiery nature.
In the , some of the Branches of Giving could be found within the endless halls of Undermountain – the mega-dungeon underneath the City of Splendor, Waterdeep.
