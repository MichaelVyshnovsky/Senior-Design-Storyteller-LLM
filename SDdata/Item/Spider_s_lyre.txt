'''''Spider's lyres''''' were [[enchanted]] [[lyre]]s used by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Appearing unassuming at first glance, these plucked stringed instruments had strings as sharp as an [[assassin]]'s blade. Those who played the lyre had to do it with utmost caution or slice their fingertips off.

==Powers==
''Spider's lyres'' possessed magic that could be heard across the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] by the mad [[drider]] named [[Kar'niss]] who served [[The Absolute]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''spider's lyres'' were carried by ranking members of the Cult of the Absolute, such as [[Minthara Baenre]]. When plucked, the instrument summoned Kar'niss, a guide who aided [[True Souls]] across the deadly lands of shadows in the [[Western Heartlands]] towards the [[Moonrise Towers]].
