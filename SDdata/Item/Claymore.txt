'''''Claymores''''' were large [[sword]]s only slightly shorter than the mighty [[greatsword]] but larger than a [[bastard sword]].

==Description==
Claymores were cross-hilted and typically had leather grips topped with a wheel-shaped pommel. The broad blade was straight and double-edged with large quillons angling toward the blade.
