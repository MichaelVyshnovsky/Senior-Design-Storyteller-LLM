Tragic heroism was a type of potion uniquely sold at Hollys Mill in Ravens Bluff.
The primary effects of tragic heroism were similar to the potion of super heroism. In addition, upon quaffing the potion any creature within  of the drinker would stop what they were doing and fight them until either were killed.
