        "mainbody": "A stinkpot was a grenade-like form of ammunition commonly used with slings and staff slings.\nStinkpots consisted of a ceramic clay vessel filled with a mix of noxious substances, typically either burning sulfur or quicklime. Upon shattering, the vessel unleashed a noxious cloud that sickened everyone within , causing nausea, the eyes to water, coughing and choking. This cloud of vapor would naturally disperse.\n* Kobolds commonly made and utilized stinkpots in their slings, including those that inhabited the Moonsea region."
