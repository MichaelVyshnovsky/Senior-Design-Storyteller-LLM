        "mainbody": "A '''''staff of the moonglow''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] used primarily by [[Harpers]] and [[elves]].",
        "Powers": "The powers of these staves were activated and deactivated silently by will when touching the staff. Expending one of the staves' charges allowed the wielder to use the [[spell]]s ''[[pass without trace]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', or ''[[free action]]'', and emit a soft light illuminating a sphere {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} from the staff. This light allowed a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'' to function as if it were underground, revealed magical dweomers by coating them with ''[[faerie fire]]'', revealed all magical inscriptions and ''[[wizard lock]]s'', and hindered the attacks and strength of all [[undead]].\n\nWhen striking an opponent, the wielder could choose to expend two charges and forego physically harming the target in exchange for preventing the target from phasing, becoming ethereal, ''[[blink|blinking]]'', or performing other similar acts for one minute. Creatures that did not possess such abilities were simply ''[[slow|slowed]]'' by the staff.\n\nA moonlit sky provided a strong boost to the martial effectiveness of the staff, making it much easier to strike and harm their enemies. A smaller boost was gained when the staff was used outdoors at night or when the moon was blocked. The touch of a ''staff of the moonglow'' prevented creatures such as [[troll]]s from regenerating.",
        "History": "These staves were created first in [[Silverymoon]] during the city's early days.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Sehanine Moonbow]], the [[elven]] goddess, carried a unique staff with properties of a ''staff of the moonglow''."
