        "mainbody": "staff of the moonglow was an enchanted quarterstaff used primarily by Harpers and elves.\nThe powers of these staves were activated and deactivated silently by will when touching the staff. Expending one of the staves charges allowed the wielder to use the spells pass without trace, find the path, or free action, and emit a soft light illuminating a sphere  from the staff. This light allowed a ring of shooting stars to function as if it were underground, revealed magical dweomers by coating them with faerie fire, revealed all magical inscriptions and wizard locks, and hindered the attacks and strength of all undead.\nWhen striking an opponent, the wielder could choose to expend two charges and forego physically harming the target in exchange for preventing the target from phasing, becoming ethereal, blinking, or performing other similar acts for one minute. Creatures that did not possess such abilities were simply slowed by the staff.\nA moonlit sky provided a strong boost to the martial effectiveness of the staff, making it much easier to strike and harm their enemies. A smaller boost was gained when the staff was used outdoors at night or when the moon was blocked. The touch of a staff of the moonglow prevented creatures such as trolls from regenerating.\nThese staves were created first in Silverymoon during the citys early days.\nSehanine Moonbow, the elven goddess, carried a unique staff with properties of a staff of the moonglow."
