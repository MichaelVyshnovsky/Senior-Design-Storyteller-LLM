'''''Infernal mace''''' were [[enchanted]] bludgeons wielded by the Iron Gauntlets of [[Bane]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
These [[mace]]s' were inscribed with filigreed infernal runes that imbued them with hellish magics.

==Powers==
''Infernal maces'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that increased their damage output and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. These weapons also dealt additional [[poison]] damage with each strike and had a chance of inflicting a longe-lasting poisoning of living targets.

==History==
These infernal weapons could be found in the hands of the [[Cult of Bane]] that infiltrated the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The Iron Gauntlets who were outfitted with ''infernal mace'' operated from [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] shops and the [[steel watcher]] foundry in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. One such Iron Gauntlet was the [[human]] woman named [[Uva]].
