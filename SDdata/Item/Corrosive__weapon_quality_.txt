'''''Corrosive''''' was a [[weapon quality]] that could be applied to magic weapons, making them acidic.

==Power==
Upon command from its wielder, the weapon would become thickly covered in slick [[acid]]ic liquid. The wielder was immune to this liquid, but it had a corrosive effect on those it struck. Applying this quality to ranged weapons would give the effects to their ammunition.

==Creation==
The [[spell]]s ''[[acid fog]]'', ''[[acid storm]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', or ''[[storm of vengeance]]'' were needed to create a ''corrosive'' weapon.

==Usage==
The followers of [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Kiaransalee]], [[Selvetarm]] would receive a ''+1 corrosive'' enchantment from casting the [[spell]] ''[[weapon of the deity]]'' and holding that deity's [[favored weapon]]. These weapons were a [[warhammer]], [[dagger]], and [[heavy mace]], respectively.

==Notable ''Corrosive'' Weapons==
* ''[[Blingdenstone warpick]]''
