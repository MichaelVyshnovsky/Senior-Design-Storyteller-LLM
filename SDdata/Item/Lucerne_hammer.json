        "mainbody": "Lucerne hammers were a type of polearm in the Realms that had an infamous reputation.\nAt a glance, this weapon bore a resemblance to a bec de corbin or military picks. Lucerne hammers had long poles, reaching as long as  in length. These were mounted with a small, clawed three or four-pronged hammer head and sporting an awl spike that was longer than that of a bec de corbin.\nIt was not uncommon for the whole weapon to be forged of steel, often gilded with precious metals or decorated with carvings.\nThe lucerne hammer was rather heavy and slow to move. They were designed to pierce heavy armor, but were also sometimes used to dismount enemies. The awl spike, rather than being used to pierce armor, was meant to keep enemies at bay.\nPlaces in the Realms where one could purchase lucerne hammers included\n* The Weaponers of Cormyr.\n* The Hammer of Lucerne, an enchanted lucerne hammer that was commissioned by Lodur the Brave under the mistaken assumption that it was actually a hammer.\n* Aruma Blane, a monk who later came into possession of The Hammer of Lucerne.\n* The Ravenian merchant Bendekar had a lucerne hammer in his homes expansive weapons collection.\nThe entrance to Shraevyns Tomb featured a statue of an armored warrior holding a massive lucerne hammer."
