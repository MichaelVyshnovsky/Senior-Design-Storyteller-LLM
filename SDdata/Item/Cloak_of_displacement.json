        "mainbody": "A '''''cloak of displacement''''', also known as a '''''minor cloak of displacement''''' when contrasted with the more potent '''''major cloak of displacement''''', was a [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[cloak]] that slightly altered the location its wearer appeared to occupy.",
        "Description": "These black leather cloaks were fashioned out of the hide of [[displacer beast]]s\n\nVariants included the ''coat of displacing'', which could be worn by [[familiar]]s,{{Cite dragon/221/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Familiar Items}} and the ''[[breechcloth]] of displacement'', which was known to be worn on [[Athas]].",
        "Powers": "[[File:Cloak of displacement bg3.png|thumb|''A cloak of displacement from the [[Western Heartlands]].'']]\nWhen this cloak was worn, it did not move the wearer but rather caused them to appear as if they were a slightly different location up to {{SI|6|in}} away. This subtle shift in appearance benefited the wearer in combat situations, protecting them from all forms of attack, including ranged missiles and [[magic]]al projectiles.\n\nThis ability only worked while the attuned wearer was conscious. If hit by an attack, the cloak lost its illusory abilities for a few seconds.\n\nThe more potent ''major cloak of displacement'' had a higher degree of success at avoiding attacks, but its powers could only be used for up to a minute and a half per day. When active, this cloak had a distorting effect on light waves.\n\nWhen ''[[mage armor]]'' was cast using the hide of a displacer beast, the recipient of the spell temporarily gained the benefits of wearing a ''cloak of displacement''.{{Cite dragon/147/Variety the Spice of Magic|24}}",
        "History": "Due to the dangers inherent to poaching displacer beasts, some wizards of the [[Moonsea]] have experimented with making ''cloaks of displacement'' out of the similarly powered but far less formidable [[Zhentish sewer rat]]s, seemingly to no avail but the creation of mundane cloaks made up of stitched-together rat hides.",
        "Reputation": "Similarly to their hatred of displacer beasts, [[blink dog]]s were known to viciously attack anyone draped with a ''cloak of displacement''.{{Cite dragon/109/Ecology of the Displacer Beast|34}}",
