        "mainbody": "A '''leather strop''' was a simple tool used to maintain small blades.",
        "Usage": "A strop was used to polish and sharpen [[knives]], [[razor]]s, [[dagger]]s, and other small blades. Because of its cheapness and small size, a strop was a useful and common piece of equipment for armed travelers to carry. It performed a similar role to a [[whetstone]], which was generally used for larger blades.",
        "Availability": "''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold handy leather strops for 2 [[cp]] each."
