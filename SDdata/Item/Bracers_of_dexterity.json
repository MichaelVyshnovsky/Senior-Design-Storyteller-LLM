These items came in many different enchantment power levels.\nSages and historians believed the bracers of dexterity originally came from the far eastern land of Kara-Tur. They were created to enhance the martial artists abilities, making them almost impossible to strike. These magical bracers were first mentioned in historical recordings of the visit of far-eastern travelers to the sword coast, even though though sages thought these records unreliable.\n*Alhelor in Port Last, circa 1372 DR had bracers of dexterity in his stores inventory.\n*Oleff Uskar on the Halls of Justice in Neverwinter circa 1372 DR.\n*Ophala Cheldarstorn owed a pair of bracers of dexterity of the +3 enchantment.\n*Neurik of the Temple of Tyr in Neverwinter circa 1372 DR."
