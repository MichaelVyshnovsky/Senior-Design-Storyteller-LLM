'''''Death ward''''' was a magical quality that could be applied to [[armor]] to protect its wearer from [[death magic]].

==Description==
Armors enchanted with this power often were enameled in black and had an otherworldly translucence. Small images of skulls were often used in the ornamentation.

==Powers==
With the first time exposure in a day, and if the wearer desired, death ward armor could automatically make its wearer immune to death-like effects, including [[negative energy]] effects, for a period of an hour and ten minutes.

==Creation==
Enchanting such armor required a ''[[death ward (spell)|death ward]]'' [[spell]].
