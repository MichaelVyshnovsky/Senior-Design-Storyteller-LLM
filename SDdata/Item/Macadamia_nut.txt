Macadamia nuts were edible nuts from the jungles of the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur.
Among the tribes of the Malatran Plateau, Koshiva date wine and pouches of macadamia nuts were a trade commodity sold together.
In the late 14 century DR, a hedgehog katanga named Abu the Lakey ran his trade business from his hut in the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba. Macadamia nuts were in Abus stock and available for sale.
During his many visits to the home of Ed Greenwood on Earth, Elminster Aumar came to love macadamia nuts and garlic butter roasted almonds served by Ed.
