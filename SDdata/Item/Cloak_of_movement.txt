'''''Cloaks of movement''''' were [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s that allowed their wearers to move untouched by [[spider]]s' webs.

==Powers==
The magic weaved into ''cloaks of movement'' was similar to that of the ''[[freedom]]'' [[spell]]. The wearer was unaffected by spider ''[[web]]s'' and similar spells.

==History==
These cloaks were believed to come from the [[Underdark]], created by spider-loving [[drow]]. The first surface owner of a ''cloak of movement'' was a [[druid]] named [[Golloth]]. The druid had a special appreciation of spider, studied their precise movement, and meditated on the complex beauty of their webs. Golloth's goal in life was protecting [[giant spider]]s from the unwitting savagery of well-meaning [[adventurer]]s, which granted the druid a life of being shunned by civilization. One day, a ''cloak of movement'' was gifted to Golloth by a drow ally.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], copies of Golloth's ''cloak of movement'' found their way into mass use and could be found or purchased from merchants in [[Neverwinter]] and [[Elventree]], among other cities.
