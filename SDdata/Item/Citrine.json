        "mainbody": "Citrine, also known as false topaz, was a variety of quartz whose color ranged from pale yellow to brown.\nThis semi-precious stone cleaved nicely and was usually facet-cut in brilliant or marquise styles. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.\nAny being wearing or carrying a citrine was protected against magic jar spells and spell effects. Ironically, citrine gems were one of the favored receptacles for the \"jar\" when casting magic jar."
