Holy Chaos! was a lesser-known card game, popular among priests of chaotic-aligned deities. Befitting the nature of chaotic deities, the rules to this game were complex and annually revised in edicts issued by the Church of Beshaba.
This game featured four suits of cards Black Bessies, Joy Bringers, Smiling Ladies, and Storm Queens. These represented the deities Beshaba, Lliira, Tymora, and Umberlee, respectively.
The cards of enchanted versions of these decks would each cast one random spell, but it would always target the wielder and be of a beneficial nature.
Tournaments for this game were known to be held annually. The winners of these tournaments would receive enchanted versions of these decks that could cast spells.
This game was considered especially popular among the clergy of Tymora and Umberlee. However, it was often hated by the clergy of lawful deities, particularly by the Church of Helm and Church of Tyr.
