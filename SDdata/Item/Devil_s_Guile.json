        "mainbody": "Devils Guile was an enchanted short sword thought to be a relic from the fields of the infinite Blood War.\nThe sword possessed a +1 enchantment and constantly generated a potent poison that, upon entering the targets wound, weakened them, sapping away their strength. The magics imbued into Devils Guile made the weapon only usable by creatures of evil inclinations.\nDevils Guile was created alongside its sister blade, Demons Spite, and apart from that, little else was known about both swords. Some claimed that Devils Guile was born in the infinite war between Baator and the Abyss. However, that theory had little weight due to the weapons relatively weak enchantments. It was much more likely that Devils Guile was created and used on the Prime Material plane. One thing sages agreed onâ€”Devils Guile and Demons Spite were created in the days of the long-forgotten past.\nCirca the , both swords were wielded by Rinara of Westgate, an ex-member of the Night Masks. She used the magic weapons in her attempts to rid the guild of the influence of the vampires who took over the organization several years prior."
