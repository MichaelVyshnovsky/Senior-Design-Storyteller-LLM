        "mainbody": "'''''Devil's Guile''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] thought to be a relic from the fields of the infinite [[Blood War]].",
        "Powers": "The sword possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and constantly generated a potent [[poison]] that, upon entering the target's wound, weakened them, sapping away their strength. The magics imbued into ''Devil's Guile'' made the weapon only usable by creatures of evil inclinations.",
        "History": "''Devil's Guile'' was created alongside its sister blade, ''[[Demon's Spite]]'', and apart from that, little else was known about both swords. Some claimed that ''Devil's Guile'' was born in the infinite war between [[Baator]] and the [[Abyss]]. However, that theory had little weight due to the weapon's relatively weak enchantments. It was much more likely that ''Devil's Guile'' was created and used on the [[Prime Material plane]]. One thing sages agreed onâ€”''Devil's Guile'' and ''Demon's Spite'' were created in the days of the long-forgotten past.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, both swords were wielded by [[Rinara]] of [[Westgate]], an ex-member of the [[Night Masks]]. She used the magic weapons in her attempts to rid the guild of the influence of the [[vampire]]s who took over the organization several years prior."
