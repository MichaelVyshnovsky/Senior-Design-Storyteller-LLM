Claris was an enchanted longsword that belonged to Mickal, an agent of the Zhentarim, who operated in the Vast and in the Ravens Bluff environs in the late 14 century DR.
Claris was a simple blade in appearance. The word "Claris" was engraved on the weapons pommel. It was imbued with +2 enchantments that made the weapon significantly more deadly than its mundane counterparts and helped to guide the blade toward its targets.
Circa the , Claris was wielded by a Zhent named Mickal, who sought to end the organization called the Flight of Arrows for their dissent and betrayal of the Zhentarim. When a group of adventurers of the Living City joined the cleric Van Der Vell and Captain Randar von Trampf in order to help the group on behalf of Ravens Bluff, Mickal led a band of Zhents against them. Mickal organized an ambush about half a days travel from the Bluff towards Mossbridges. In the ensuing battle, Mickal used Claris against his foes. Even though the encounters outcome was unknown, Claris likely left the hands of its slain master and was claimed by one of the Ravenaar adventurers.
