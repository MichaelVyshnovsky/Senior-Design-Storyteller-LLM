        "mainbody": "The '''''wand of citrine force''''' was a magical item in [[Ususi Manaallin]]'s possession as of {{yearlink|1373}}. It cast a spell similar to ''[[ethereal chamber]]''.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|144|14}}",
        "Description": "The ''wand of citrine force'' was a slender rod made of translucent yellow glass.",
        "Powers": "The ''wand of citrine force'' had two known modes of functioning. One of the modes of functioning cast a spell akin to ''[[ethereal chamber]]'' on the target it was pointed at, except that unlike the spell, the wand's function could function outside of the [[ethereal plane]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|199|19}} Its second function was its ability to create obstacles; it could be used to block out portals, for instance, in this way.The spell it most closely resembles is ''[[ethereal chamber]]'', but its function in blocking out portals resembles no existing spell. It is possible that it duplicated a less situational version of the spell, which also had the power to create obstacles without having to target a single creature.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1373}}, [[Ususi Manaallin]] held such a wand. It was almost spent;{{cite book/Lady of Poison|285|30}} she employed one last charge to distract the Rotting Man.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|290-291|30}}",
