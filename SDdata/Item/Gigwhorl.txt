A gigwhorl was a small device used to create distracting sounds.
Originating in Calimshan, these tightly wound tops had a locking spring mechanism that would unwind when the gigwhorl was tossed, creating a loud clattering noise when they struck the ground. This device was useful to distract guards or to create noise to cover other sound.
A gigwhorl cost 3 gold pieces through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
