A '''gigwhorl''' was a small device used to create distracting sounds.

==Uses==
Originating in [[Calimshan]], these tightly wound tops had a locking spring mechanism that would unwind when the gigwhorl was tossed, creating a loud clattering noise when they struck the ground. This device was useful to distract guards or to create noise to cover other sound.

==Prices==
A gigwhorl cost 3 [[gold piece]]s through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].
