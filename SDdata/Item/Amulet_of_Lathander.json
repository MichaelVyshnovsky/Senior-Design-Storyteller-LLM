        "Description": "''Amulet of Lathander'' were hammered disks of [[platinum]].",
        "Powers": "When worn in battle, these magic amulets dispensed light healing to the wearer when they fell but had not yet expired. ''Amulets of Lathander'' brought these individuals back from the brink of death. That magic could only be activated not more than thrice per day. The amulet possessed greater powers that were only activated when worn by priests of Lathander. Instead of dispersing minimal healing magics, ''Amulets of Lathander'' cast ''[[heal]]'' [[spell]] on the wearer. This power was accessible thrice per day.\n\nThe item's divine enchantments made it only wearable by those who revered good. The amulet burned everyone else until it was removed."
