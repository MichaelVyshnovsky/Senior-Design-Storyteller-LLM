Tortoise shields were magical shields that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Tortoise shields were small buckler-style shields known as daraqs in Zakhara.
Though they appeared as small shields, these unique items created a powerful invisible force field around the body of the shield that protected the wielder as a full body shield. Tortoise shields were especially effective at blocking missile attacks.
