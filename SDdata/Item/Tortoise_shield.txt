'''''Tortoise shields''''' were magical shields that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|45}}{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Description==
''Tortoise shields'' were small [[buckler]]-style shields known as [[daraq]]s in Zakhara.

==Powers==
Though they appeared as small shields, these unique items created a powerful invisible force field around the body of the shield that protected the wielder as a full body shield. Tortoise shields were especially effective at blocking missile attacks.
