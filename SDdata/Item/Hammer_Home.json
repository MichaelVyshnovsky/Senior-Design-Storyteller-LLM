        "mainbody": "'''''Hammer Home''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[warhammer]], forged out of [[cold iron]] and blessed by a [[cleric]] of [[Lathander]].",
        "Powers": "''Hammer Home'' was specially forged and enchanted in dawn's first light to give it powers against creatures from [[Outer Planes]]. It possessed a ''+1'' enchantment, but when wielded against extraplanar targets, the weapon effectively became a ''+2'' warhammer that scorched its targets with Lathander's divine magic.",
        "History": "This enchanted warhammer's history was largely mysterious. In [[1372 DR]], ''Hammer Home'' was in the hands of the [[Gillian's Hill Gang]], a group of bandits who took over the fire cairn tower on [[Gillian's Hill]]'s summit and menaced the locals and traveling merchants."
