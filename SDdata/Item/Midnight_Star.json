        "mainbody": "'''Midnight Star''' was a variety of [[wine]] from the vineyards of [[Al'Quidm]], distributed by the [[Sindarian]] merchant house of Procampur in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Midnight Star was an overpriced, sweet red table wine of decent quality. It had a striking brilliant red color.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Midnight Star wine was brought to the year-end celebration festival in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. [[Trendel P. Butterworth]], a representative of Sindarian house, entered the wine into a wine-tasting and grading competition. Butterworth's sales pitch claimed that the wine came from a place called \"Al'Quidm\" and was produced out of grapes gathered only during moonless nights by the city's twenty most beautiful women. Because of that, Trendel sold Midnight Star at a single [[gold]] [[coin]] per bottle or ten per hand keg."
