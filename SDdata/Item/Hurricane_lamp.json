        "Description": "The hurricane lamp design included a glass cylinder around the flame, which served to protect it from being blown out by wind, be it accidentally from a breeze or some sudden rapid motion from the bearer, or intentionally, even if from a magic effect such as a ''[[gust of wind]]'' spell.\n\nA variety of adorned hurricane lamps with a [[Dwarf|dwarven]]-made mechanism to raise and lower the [[wick]] was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''."
