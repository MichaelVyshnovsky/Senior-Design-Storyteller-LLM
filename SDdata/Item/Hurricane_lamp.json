        "mainbody": "A hurricane lamp was a type of lamp with a glass chimney to protect the flame against the wind.\nThe hurricane lamp design included a glass cylinder around the flame, which served to protect it from being blown out by wind, be it accidentally from a breeze or some sudden rapid motion from the bearer, or intentionally, even if from a magic effect such as a gust of wind spell.\nA variety of adorned hurricane lamps with a dwarven-made mechanism to raise and lower the wick was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue."
