        "mainbody": "Turmish brick  was a cheese crafted in Turmish. It was also sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nA heavy red local wine lent this crumbly cheese its reddish color and a sweet taste. Unlike the wine used to make it, this cheese traveled well and was popular as far away as Neverwinter. It was much denser and heavier than other wine-based cheeses, such as Vilhon blanc.\nThe cheese was produced and ripened in large platters. Individual bricks were then carved and wrapped in red wax.\nTurmish brick could be purchased in the following sizes\n* Rectangular loaf, 1 lb. (0.45 kg.) 4 sp\n* Cubic whey, 1000 lbs. (43.6 kg.) 35 gp"
