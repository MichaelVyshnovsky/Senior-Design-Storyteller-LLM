'''''Sure strike bullets''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[sling]] missile that made it hard to miss the targets.

==Powers==
Seemingly simple in appearance, ''sure strike bullets'' were imbued with magical currents that made them feel lighter, more balanced, and very likely to hit their targets. Each [[bullet]] was enchanted with a ''[[true striking]]'' spell, equating it to a powerful ''+5'' enchantment.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''sure strike bullets'' were used by [[Aurilite]] [[Stormsister]]s and postulants who joined the [[Legion of the Chimera]] to bring destruction on the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
