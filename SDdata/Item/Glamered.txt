Glamered armor was magically enhanced to transform itself upon command to take the form of ordinary clothing.
One who would craft glamered armor had to know the spell disguise self.
Glamered armor appeared normally as regular armor. Upon the wearers command, glamered armor changed form, taking the shape of a set of ordinary clothing. Its other physical properties, however, such as mass and level of protection, remained the same. When disguised, glamered armor could only be revealed as such by a true seeing spell or similar magic.
Mirt the Moneylender owned a mithral shirt that was glamered.
