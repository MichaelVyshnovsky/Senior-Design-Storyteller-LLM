Alurlyath was a wine crafted somewhere in Undermountain and sold through contacts in Skullport.
This full-bodied sweet white wine had a slightly nutty aftertaste. Alurlyath glowed with silver and green light, further enhancing it on a romantic evening. It was usually stored in special ceramic bottles during transport to keep the light from fading.
* It was also sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue as Undermountain Alurlyath.
* This wine was served at the Low Lantern, a tavern in the town of Eveningstar, Cormyr. However, alurlyath was a rare find that could be found in the taverns wine cellar.
* The Friendly Arm inn in the Western Heartlands offered alurlyath for six gold coins per serving.
* In Athkatla, the capital of Amn, alurlyath was available from the luxurious Mithrest Inn.
Undermountain Alurlyath could be purchased from Auroras in the following containers
* Ceramic bottle (5 sp)
* Hand keg (30 sp)
* Cask (8 gp)
Auroras noted that contact with this wines creators was required to purchase more than a hand keg.
