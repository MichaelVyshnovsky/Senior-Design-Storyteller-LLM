        "mainbody": "hisperchain was a unique suit of chain armor found in Lost Souls Swamp in the mid-1480s DR.\nThe silvery armor covered most of the body and was made of mithral. While mithral would normally be light, Whisperchain was actually completely weightless.\nThe suit of armor was weightless and partially ethereal, and imparted it on the wearer. It let them strike effectively at incorporeal targets that otherwise slid out of material reality. It also made the wearer blurry and harder to hit in turn, and boosted their awareness and reflexes in both dodging and striking.\nThe armor was stored in a secret loot stash in Lost Souls Swamp by Evrim Whitehair. When they were killed by their friends, a shadow monster in the swamp trapped Evrim as a spectral undead, and the armor (and the rest of the treasures) remained in the same pool Evrims body was dumped in. It may have been recovered a few years later by adventurers pursuing a piece of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll held by the medusa Sshaastess, who had laired nearby."
