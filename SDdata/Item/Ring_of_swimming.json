They enhanced the wearers swimming speed and enabled them to swim for hours without tiring, allowed them to dive safely from up to  above water, kept the wearer afloat under all but the most severe weather conditions, and allowed the wearer to hold their breath for four minutes underwater.\nSetara bint Farid, a famous corsair from Zakhara, wore a ring of swimming."
