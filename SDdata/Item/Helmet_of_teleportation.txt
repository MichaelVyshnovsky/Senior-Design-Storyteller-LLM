A helmet of teleportation was an enchanted helmet capable of magically transporting its wearer.
These items appeared in many forms just like mundane helmets.
These helms granted the wearer the ability to teleport once per day to a known destination. A wizard wearing a helm of teleportation who had the teleport spell memorized could teleport six times per day.
Sememmon, the ruler of Darkhold, wore a helm of teleportation.
