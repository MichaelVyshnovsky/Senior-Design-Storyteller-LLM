        "mainbody": "hazidhea was a sentient and magical sword. Khazidhea meant \"Cutter\" in the Drow language, and it was often referred to as such.\nKhazidhea was a finely crafted longsword that could cut through flesh, bone, armor, and even rock. The edge of its blade glowed with a barely-perceptible line of red light. It was able to change its pommel to appeal to a prospective wielder.\nThe sword itself was sentient, and could project its \"thoughts\" into the users head and even affect his or her reasoning. On some occasions, users went into battle against impossible numbers without realizing it until their enemies lay dead before them. In the process, they often got hurt, but didnt notice. Distance was the only true way to escape from Khazidheas influence, although if the wielder and sword had spent many years together, a kind of vague telepathic connection remained between them.\nKhazidhea was always hungry for blood and battle, and it was never sated. Khazidhea had one desire to be held by the greatest warrior. It would even accept its wielders death in the pursuit of a better wielder.\nOne version of Khazidheas creation indicated it was in fact a demonic intelligence that was forced into the form of a sword in the Abyss around the third millennium before Dalereckoning. Another version claimed that faerzress emanations in the Underdark had given it sentience.\nCutter was once one of the longswords wielded by Dantrag Baenre, the weapons master of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan. While it was carried by the Baenre weapons master, the swords hilt appeared as a demons head.\nWhen Drizzt DoUrden led Catti-brie and Artemis Entreri from Menzoberranzan, Dantrag confronted them Drizzt and the Baenre drow came to blows. Drizzt defeated Dantrag and thus acquired the sword. After Drizzts victory, the sword changed its pommel into the head of a unicorn (the symbol of Mielikki, Drizzts goddess). However, preferring his scimitars to the longsword, Drizzt gave Cutter to Catti-brie and, after she dominated the swords will, it accepted her adopting the form of the panther, Guenhwyvar, for its hilt, with the symbols of the dwarven gods etched into its side.\nDuring the conflict with Obould Many-Arrows, Catti-brie was wounded and unable to engage in combat. Khazidhea became furious and ensnared Delly Curtie, Wulfgars jealous and neglected wife. The power of the sword, too great for Delly to control, consumed her and soon led her to her death at the hands of a group of orcs. Though Cutter was wielded by several of the orcs for a while, it eventually found its way back into the hands of Drizzt DoUrden, who used it during his fight with Obould.\nDrizzt lost the blade after it became stuck in Oboulds armor. When he tore his armor off (to rid himself of enchanted spider buckles Kaerlic Suun Wett had planted there, so he would die in battle), Obould took up Khazidhea. However, he threw it away as soon as it shouted for him to wield it as his own Obould believed it to be trickery on the part of Drizzt. Later, Khazidhea was wielded by Tosun Armgo, after he found it in the armor left behind by Obould Many-Arrows.\nTosun eventually realized that he did not have as much command over the weapon as he believed. Therefore, he returned the sword to Drizzt, who donated it to the elves of the Moonwood for study. \nHowever, Tosun ended up with the sword once again and decided to pass it on to one of his two children in 1484 DR. His daughter, Doumwielle Armgo, won the duel that decided who it was to go to in anger and under the influence of the sword, her brother, Teirflin Armgo, attempted to kill her with Khazidhea in the middle of the night. She turned the sword on him, killing him, then fled in horror and fear. The sword took her under its control. Tosun eventually found her and traveled with her to the Underdark.\nWhen Tosun and Doumwielle returned to Menzoberranzan, Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre first gave Khazidhea to Andzrel Baenre. When he failed to master the sword, she gave it back to Tosun. Doumwielle ended up with the sword once again, but in 1485 DR she dropped it in a river. Despite the distance, Khazidhea was able to feel the death of Tosun due to spending so much time at his hip."
