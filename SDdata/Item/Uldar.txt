century DR potter from Eveningstar|Uldar (person)
Uldar was an alcoholic drink brewed and exported out of Eshpurta in Amn.
Uldar was a slightly bitter and highly alcoholic drink of pale yellow hue. The drink was a good accompaniment for nuts and cheese. Despite its decent quality, Uldar was considered a low-brow libation.
The Harfin Draether tavern and eatery in Athkatlas Temple District served Uldar among its many other drinks however, it was considered to be no better than a mouthwash by the snobby locals.
