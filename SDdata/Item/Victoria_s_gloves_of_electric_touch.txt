'''''Victoria's gloves of electric touch''''' were a pair of unique [[enchanted]] [[elf|elven]] gloves that once belonged to an [[Akh'Velahr]] war party leader, [[Victoria]], who died in the [[Weeping War]].

==Description==
''Victoria's gloves of electric touch'' were elbow-length [[leather]] gloves.

==Powers==
These magic gloves held the enchantment that increased the wearer's strength and willpower. Additionally, they allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[shocking grasp]]'' spell at will. These gloves held at least three charges of the spell.

==History==
During the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading [[Army of Darkness]] and met her demise in the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victoria's gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. ''Victoria's gloves of electric touch'' never reached the [[Underdark]] as a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs.
