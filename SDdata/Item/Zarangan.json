        "mainbody": "A '''''zarangan''''' was a smooth, [[magic]]al stone, shaped to fit in the palm of a hand that granted several [[spell]]-like abilities and could serve as a +1 melee weapon. In the years circa [[1372 DR]], they were most often found in [[Halruaa]].",
        "Powers": "The main abilities these [[artifact]]s granted were impressive. They allowed anyone holding the stone to cast ''[[dimension door]]'' almost at-will, cast ''[[cure critical wounds]]'' once per day and, upon uttering a command word utilize an ability that worked like the spell ''[[word of recall]]'', once per day, to return to a home location that was designated upon the stone's creation. These pre-determined locations had remained linked to the stones for centuries, so anyone using this ability in the modern era might end up in the abandoned ruins of some long-dead [[Halruaan]] [[wizard]]'s sanctum or [[lich]]'s tomb.\n\nBecause they were made with a specific magic-user in mind, ''zarangans'' were highly customized. In addition to these main abilities, they granted ''[[spell immunity]]'' against a few spells and allowed the wielder to cast one of either ''[[chain lightning]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[lesser ironguard]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'' or ''[[water breathing]]'' once per hour.",
        "Appearance": "''Zarangans'' were made from smooth stones, cut to form-fit to the hand of its user and polished until they had a vitreous shine. They had protrusions along one side that slid between the magic-user's fingers. The command word, used to activate the stone's recall ability was often etched into the sheer surface.",
        "History": "These [[artifact]]s were a remnant of ancient [[Netheril]], having been brought to Halruaa after its fall."
