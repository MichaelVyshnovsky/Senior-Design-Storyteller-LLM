        "mainbody": "zarangan was a smooth, magical stone, shaped to fit in the palm of a hand that granted several spell-like abilities and could serve as a +1 melee weapon. In the years circa 1372 DR, they were most often found in Halruaa.\nThe main abilities these artifacts granted were impressive. They allowed anyone holding the stone to cast dimension door almost at-will, cast cure critical wounds once per day and, upon uttering a command word utilize an ability that worked like the spell word of recall, once per day, to return to a home location that was designated upon the stones creation. These pre-determined locations had remained linked to the stones for centuries, so anyone using this ability in the modern era might end up in the abandoned ruins of some long-dead Halruaan wizards sanctum or lichs tomb.\nBecause they were made with a specific magic-user in mind, zarangans were highly customized. In addition to these main abilities, they granted spell immunity against a few spells and allowed the wielder to cast one of either chain lightning, cone of cold, lesser ironguard, levitate, unseen servant or water breathing once per hour. \nZarangans were made from smooth stones, cut to form-fit to the hand of its user and polished until they had a vitreous shine. They had protrusions along one side that slid between the magic-users fingers. The command word, used to activate the stones recall ability was often etched into the sheer surface.\nThese artifacts were a remnant of ancient Netheril, having been brought to Halruaa after its fall."
