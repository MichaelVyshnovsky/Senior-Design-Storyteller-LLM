        "mainbody": "Boots of stalking were enchanted boots, invaluable to creatures in need of stealth.\nThese boots were soft and black-colored boots.\nBoots of stalking allowed the wearer to activate their invisibility spell-like ability. Additionally, the boots increased the wearers movement speed. An average pair possessed three charges of the invisibility spell.\nIn 1369 DR, a pair of these night-black boots were in possession of a group of orog renegades in the Elven Catacombs, who rebelled against their kin and the Cult of the Dragon employees."
