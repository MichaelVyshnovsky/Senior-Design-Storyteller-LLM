'''Peridot''' was the gem-quality version of [[wikipedia:en:olivine|olivine]] which occurred in volcanic basalts or with other [[quartz]] deposits.

==Description==
These gemstones were found in shades of light to dark olive green and were usually facet cut.

Peridots were considered sacred by followers of [[Gaerdal Ironhand]] and [[Yondalla]]â€”appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11, 15}}

==Powers==
Peridots were frequently used as a material component for [[abjuration]] spells and in constructing magic items that offered protection against spells and enchantments, such as ''[[Mordenkainen's private sanctum]]''. A typical specimen had a base value of 500 gp or 50 to 100 gp depending on market demand.
