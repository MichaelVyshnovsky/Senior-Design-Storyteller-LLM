Peridot was the gem-quality version of olivine which occurred in volcanic basalts or with other quartz deposits.
These gemstones were found in shades of light to dark olive green and were usually facet cut.
Peridots were considered sacred by followers of Gaerdal Ironhand and Yondallaâ€”appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.
Peridots were frequently used as a material component for abjuration spells and in constructing magic items that offered protection against spells and enchantments, such as Mordenkainens private sanctum. A typical specimen had a base value of 500 gp or 50 to 100 gp depending on market demand.
