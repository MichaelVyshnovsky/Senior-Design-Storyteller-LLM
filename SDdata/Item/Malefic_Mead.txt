'''Malefic Mead''' was a type of dangerous alcoholic drink found in the [[Abyss]]al city of [[Samora]], on the layer of [[Azzagrat]].

==Description==
Malefic Mead was a rare [[fiend]]ish drink and was hard to come by anywhere but Samora. The concoction was deadly to the inhabitants of the [[Prime Material plane]] and for some lucky mortal imbibers â€“ just highly poisonous. Those rare ones who survived drinking the [[mead]] went into a roaring drunk rage and, eventually, succumbed to being violently ill.
