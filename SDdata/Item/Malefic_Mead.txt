Malefic Mead was a type of dangerous alcoholic drink found in the Abyssal city of Samora, on the layer of Azzagrat.
Malefic Mead was a rare fiendish drink and was hard to come by anywhere but Samora. The concoction was deadly to the inhabitants of the Prime Material plane and for some lucky mortal imbibers â€“ just highly poisonous. Those rare ones who survived drinking the mead went into a roaring drunk rage and, eventually, succumbed to being violently ill.
