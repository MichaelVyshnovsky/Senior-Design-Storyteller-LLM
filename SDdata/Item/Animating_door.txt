An animating door was a type of dweomered door that would temporarily bring to life any corpse that was brought through its threshold, as per the spell animate dead. Depending on the level of decomposition of the deceased person or creature, it could be brought back as a skeleton or zombie version of its previous self.
Animating doors were created with use of the animate dead spell.
