        "Powers": "''Lathar's Last Belt'' was ensorcelled to completely shield its wearer from [[spell]]s like ''[[finger of death]]'' and ''[[power word kill]].''",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the mage named Lathar thought himself a worthy opponent to a well-known [[archmage]]. He challenged the archmage to a spell-duel but not before crafting a magical belt that would protect Lathar from the archwizard's favorite [[death magic]] spells. In battle, Lathar's belt worked as intended: the archmage's ''fingers of death'' and ''power words'' did not affect the challenger in a siltiest. Overconfident in his magic belt, Lathar laughed at his opponent, mockingly challenging him to do his best. The mage did just that. He summoned a giant [[dire bear]] bear who killed the unknown mage with one bite. After that, the belt became known as ''Lathar's Last Belt''. By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the belt found its way into the hands of [[undead]] who claimed an unnamed burial barrow in the [[Neverwinter Wood]]."
