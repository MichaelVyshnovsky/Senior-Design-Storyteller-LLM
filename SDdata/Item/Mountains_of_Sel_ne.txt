Mountains of Selûne was a unique enchanted morningstar, named after the celestial body of Selûne.
Apart from possessing a +1 enchantment, the bludgeon made its wielder immune to blindness. Its magics guided the wielders arm in battle, attracting the morningstar to its target as if through magnetism. The weapon itself was forged using a mysterious metallic substance that bent and absorbed light around it. It emitted gentle radiance at night, similar to the light of Selûne high in the sky.
By the , Mountains of Selûne was already quite old and had a reputation forged in many battles that raged over the years since its creation. Most of its past was shrouded in mystery, and its origins were unknown. In 1312 DR, the morningstar was brought to Icewind Dale by a general of the Legion of the Chimera—the bugbear Guthma, who led the cults goblinoid army to level the Ten Towns. After Guthmas demise at the hands of mercenary adventurers of Targos, the enchanted weapon changed hands once again.
