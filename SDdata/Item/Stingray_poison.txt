'''Stingray poison''' was a type of venom produced by and extracted from a species of [[fish]] called [[sting ray]]s. 

==Effects==
Despite not necessarily being deadly, stingray venom was still potent and dangerous. Those affected by the poison were recommended to immediately seek a healer's aid. Additionally, the poison affected the target's constitution and caused bad nausea.  Individuals of good health and resilience were expected to fully recover from the potion's effects within 24-48 hours.

If by some unlucky occurrence, a creature consumed stingray poison, the substance had a high chance of affecting the imbiber.{{Cite dragon/81/Taking the Sting Out of Poison|16}}

==History==
Vials of ''stingray poison'' were in common use around the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Captain [[Allendry]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' outfitted his crew and offered the deadly substance for sale.
