Additionally, the poison affected the targets constitution and caused bad nausea.  Individuals of good health and resilience were expected to fully recover from the potions effects within 24-48 hours.

Vials of stingray poison were in common use around the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the deadly substance for sale.
