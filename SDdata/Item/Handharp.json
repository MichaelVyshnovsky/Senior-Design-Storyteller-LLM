        "mainbody": "A '''''handharp''''' was a rare magical musical instrument favored by traveling [[Harpers]]. In fact, these items were believed to have been initially crafted by traveling Harpers.",
        "Description": "''Handharps'' were wooden crescent-shaped instruments about the size of a man's hand. They were strung with enchanted metal strings.",
        "Powers": "The magical properties of these items could be used by anyone capable of playing a tune. When played, a ''handharp'' created four blue globes of light that behaved like the ''[[dancing lights]]'' [[spell]]. The person playing the ''handharp'' could direct these globes with passive concentration.\n\nThe magic of a ''handharp'' affected all [[undead]] within a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} radius of the instrument, making it more difficult for them to strike and harm targets. Life-draining attacks from undead were also easier to resist within this radius. The magic also prevented any creature within the radius from being ''[[Charm person|charmed]]''. Any ''charmed'' creature walking into the radius would be stunned for as long as they remained near the ''handharp''.\n\nOnce per day a ''handharp'' could be used to open a ''[[dimension door]]'' that could transport a single living target up to {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} away. This was activated by plucking a specific string while singing a specific note. Using this power prevented a ''handharp's'' other magic from functioning for ten minutes.\n\nIf carried by a [[bard]], the area of effect for all of the ''handharp's'' magic was doubled, including the distance the ''dimension door'' could transport the user."
