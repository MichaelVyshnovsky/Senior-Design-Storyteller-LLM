        "mainbody": "yes of charming were a set of magical eyes that allowed the wearer to charm others.\nEyes of charming were a pair of crystal lenses (typically made of blue quartz) that fitted over the users eyes. It was possible to wear only one of the eyes, instead of the pair, though this was far less effective.\nThese eyes stored three charges, and these charges would refresh at sunrise. When worn, the wearer could use a charge to charm another person that they could see, provided the other person was within . However, it was possible for the target to avoid being charmed.\nIn the 14 century DR, the lizardmen that inhabited the sixth level of the deep mines of New Verdigris had a set of eyes of charming amongst their stash of treasure."
