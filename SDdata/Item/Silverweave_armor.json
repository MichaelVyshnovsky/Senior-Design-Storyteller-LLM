        "mainbody": "'''Silverweave armor''' was a type of [[light armor]] fashioned by the [[triton]]s and [[shalarin]]s of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n{{Quote|''Tried on a silverweave heartsleeve once during my travels there, and I daresay I cut a dashing gladiatorial figure. I marveled at the fact that a shark tried to bite my arm and I felt only the pressure of its jaws (and none of its teeth) on my protected arm.''|[[Elminster]]}}",
        "Description": {
            "Creation": "Silverweave was created from [[silver coral]]. While the coral was still alive, it was cultivated in calm waters where the fronds could be woven together in a net-like pattern, causing the coral to fuse together as it grew. To craft silverweave, a patch of this netting was cut away, and a skilled armorer would work quickly to thread additional silver coral fronds through the gaps. If done correctly, the whole weave would fuse together over the twelve days it took for the coral to completely die. The material was then cut and shaped&mdash;often fitted specifically for the individual who would wear it, if possible&mdash;before being repeatedly heated and cooled until it became as strong as metal without losing its flexibility."
        },
        "Usage": "Silverweave was the preferred form of armor among the tritons of [[Serôs]] and one of two favored armor types among the shalarin (the other being the much bulkier [[pearl armor]]). While the creation of silverweave was credited to the tritons and shalarins, silverweave was used by all humanoid civilizations of Serôs, with the leggings being particularly favored by the [[aquatic elves]].\n\nPrior to the [[Fifth Shalarin Passing]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, silverweave armor was exclusively worn during wartime.",
        "Notable Owners of Silverweave": "*[[Tu'ala'keth]], a shalarin [[priestess]] of [[Umberlee]] active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], wore a set of silverweave armor that was enchanted to allow her to breathe air."
