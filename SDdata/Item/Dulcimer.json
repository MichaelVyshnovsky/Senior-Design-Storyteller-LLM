        "mainbody": "A dulcimer was a stringed instrument known in the Realms. The Zakharan version was known as a santur.\nThe dulcimer had strings stretched over a sounding board, which was typically trapezoidal in shape. The strings would be plucked or struck with a hammer. The santur was similar in appearance to the qanun.\nThey were also popular instruments in Damara, where they provided hearthside entertainment.\nA dulcimer typically cost 25 gp and weighed . Dulcimers produced by Damaran craftsmen were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue."
