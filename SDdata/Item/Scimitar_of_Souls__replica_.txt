The '''''Scimitar of Souls''''' was a replica of [[Iyachtu Xvim]]'s ''[[Scimitar of Souls]]''.{{Template:Cite game/Icewind Dale II|}}

==History==
''Circa'' [[1310 DR]], [[Madae]] of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] ordered one of her most talented weapon-smiths to craft the weapon at the [[Severed Hand]] in the [[Spine of the World]]. Once it was finished, she had it placed in the hands of a statue of Iyachtu Xvim, both to honor the Godson and to arm his [[avatar]] should he one day appear. This happened when adventurers came to defeat them.

==Description==
It was a [[scimitar]] with a polished, black blade. The blade was large and serrated all down its back, around its tip, and one quarter of the way down its edge. Although finely forged, it had a fittingly brutal appearance. It weighed {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
It was a ''+3 scimitar'' that could suck the life from those it struck, severely weakening them. It could also be used to [[dispel magic]].
