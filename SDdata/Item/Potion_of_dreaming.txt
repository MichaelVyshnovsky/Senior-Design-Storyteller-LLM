Potions of dreaming were magical liquids that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider and the bottom than they were at the top.
The imbiber of this potion experienced a vision of something that they desired. After consuming the potion, the imbiber named something that they wished to learn more about. When they went to sleep, they had a dream that revealed one fact about the named object, including the objects location, dangers regarding the object, etc.
Each potion allowed for one dream. Upon waking, the imbiber vividly remembered the information garnered from the dream.
