The '''''Ear of Myth Drannor''''' was an enchanted monument that stood in the middle of the [[Nightingale Court]] in [[Myth Drannor]].
{{quote|''In happier days I listened for glad tidings, and repeated them so all would be happy. I helped citizens find things that were lost... now I listen to the wails of the dying, and repeat the evil mutterings of monsters clothing their treasures down in the dark.''|The ''Ear of Myth Drannor''}}

==Description==
The ''Ear of Myth Drannor'' was a tall column-shaped stature that rose about {{SI|20'|'"|long=yes}} over the cobblestone plaza in the center of majestic and elegant Nightingale Court. The column started with a wider base, extended into a thinner shaft, and ended in a wide horn-like gapped top that extended on one side, vaguely reminiscent of an [[elf]] ear. The body of the ''Ear'' was decorated with arcane symbols.

==Powers==
The ''Ear of Myth Drannor'' possessed limited sentience and responded to requests of the citizens of ancient Myth Drannor. The monument carried sounds, thoughts, songs, and words upon request, making them audible for the petitioner. When the monument was in idle mode, it emitted positive news, stories, words, and other similar sounds for everyone in the plaza to hear. The monument's function was to remember and convey pleasant things, bringing happiness to the City of Song's citizens. The monument spoke in a beautiful female voice.

==History==
After the disastrous events of the [[Weeping War]], the monument's enchantments were affected by the high-level spells and [[wild magic]], making it emit constant sounds of whispers in countless voices and languages.

The magic that allowed the monument to record and replay happy tidings instead recorded death and suffering since the War. In [[1369 DR]], a group of heroes, the [[Veiled Ones]], used the monument to bring them words and memories of powerful artifacts hidden in the ruined city. Before the heroes departed, the ''Ear'' caught and played the new verse of the prophetic ''[[Song of Faer√ªn]]''.
