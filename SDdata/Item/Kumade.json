        "mainbody": "A kumade or climbing rake was a type of multi-purpose tool and weapon used in Kara-Tur and favored by ninja.\nIt was 6 feet (1.8 meters) long with a wooden shaft and a pointed, pronged rake-head at one end.\nA kumade could be used as a rake or a climbing tool. One could hook the prongs in a crack or on a ledge or sill and scale the pole. It could also be wielded one-handed as a weapon, though it was only as damaging as a dagger.\nAs it could be carried as part of a disguise without raising too much suspicion, and thanks to its use as a climbing tool, many ninja used kumades.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, kumades were used by ninja in Kozakura, such as Masaki, and Koryo, such as the Panthers of Xi, who used it as their symbol. It was also used by adventurers such as Tauk Kodagai. They were also found in Wa.\n* The black kumade of the Panthers of Xi\n* The black kumades of Guul Shatterneck\n* Masaki, a ninja operating in Maeshi Province in Kozakura."
