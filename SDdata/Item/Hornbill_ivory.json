The sturdy beak could be carved like ivory, and was used to make personal items like combs or beads. It was also used as an inlay in stone or wooden furniture. A typical price was 7 silver pieces per pound (0.45kg).\nHornbill ivory could be used as a material component for spells as well as magical items and tokens that pertained to flight."
