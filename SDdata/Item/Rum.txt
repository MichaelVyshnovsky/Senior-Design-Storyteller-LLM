Rum was a variety of fragrant distilled alcohol most famously associated with the pirates of the Sea of Fallen Stars, thanks to it being a very common type of drink carried aboard.
The fortified town and the isle of Skaug in the Nelanther Isles was known as a major producer of rum. Another producer of rum was One-Eyed Jax in Luskan on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.
Rum was on offer at The Happy Stein and Skullys Bar and Bait dockside tavern in the city of the Ravens Bluff
Throughout Faerûn, rum was used to flavor and moisten fruitcakes, including those sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. Auroras gingerbread was also sold with rum sauce. Black forest cake decorated with rum-soaked cherries was one of the pastries on the Downunda Patisseries menu in Ravens Bluff.
Rum was found only on the surface of Toril, making it a valuable export into the Underdark and the drow city of Menzoberranzan. Similarly, in Maztica, rum was rare and found in Ulatos, from where it was sold to the towns of Tezat and Azatl at the dockside drinking establishments.
