        "mainbody": "A robe of eyes was a wondrous item that allowed its wearer to see invisible creatures, see into the Ethereal Plane at all times, and to see in every direction.\nA robe of eyes appeared like a normal robe adorned with several patterns that resembled eyes.\nVariations in the shape of jellabas and kimonos were known in Zakhara and Kara-Tur, respectively.\nBesides becoming able to see in all directions, the wearer of a robe of eyes became magically competent at visual searches. Additionally, the wearer gained darkvision and the ability to not lose eysight even when averting eyes from an enemy.\nHowever, the robe was sensitive to strong magical light. If a light, continual flame, or daylight spell were cast on the robe, its wearer risked becoming temporarily blind.\nWhen worn in the Nine Hells, most of the robes powers remained intact, though its ability to aid in tracking would be nullified.\nOn occasion, these robes were created in two variations, lesser robes of eyes and greater robes of eyes. The greater variation not only granted the wearer true seeing but also improved their chances of spotting objects, danger, traps, etc., as well as their investigation skills. The lesser robes came with nine charges of the true seeing spell, on average, usable once per day.\n*Dendybar the Mottled got his nickname from his mottled robe of eyes.\n*Damien Morienus died wearing his trusted robe of eyes said robe was recovered off his undead body in the Accursed Tower in Icewind Dale.\n*Halaster Blackcloak, the \"Mad Mage\" of Undermountain, famously wore a robe of eyes.\n*Larloch, Netherese lich and master of Warlocks Crypt.\n*Szass Tam, Thayan Zulkir of Necromancy.\n*Grazzt, the demon lord of Azzagrat.\n*Vlaakith CLVII, Lich-Queen of the githyanki.\n*Antilia, the half-elven daughter and servant of Mephistopheles.\n*Kylia, a gnome illusionist in service of Laeral Silverhand in the 14 century DR.\n*A derro savant of the Slime Clan.\n*Wearers of Zakharan jellabas of eyes included Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali, Grandfather of the Everlasting Captain Soot of the Ebony Queen and Qirmiz min Hudid, agent of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.\nRobes of eyes were often used by senior Helmite clerics when they were out of their heavy armor but wanted to remain vigilant."
