        "mainbody": "'''Almost A-Wing''' was one of the more notable dishes from the city of [[Velen]] in the nation of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Description": "The dish was made of whole small [[chicken]]s and [[grouse]]. The birds were affixed together on a [[steel]] [[skewer]] and seared in [[oil]]-filled [[pan]]s until tender. When the meat was soft and falling off skewers, the meat was then promptly served on hot steamed [[potato]] cakes, typically plated on long narrow serving dishes.",
        "History": "As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Almost A-Wing could be found on [[Blackthorn's Brew]]'s menu, a [[festhall]] on the [[Captain's Cliff]] in Velen. The dish was mentioned among other notable foods included in [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s published guide to [[Amn]] and Tethyr."
