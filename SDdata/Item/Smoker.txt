Smokers were props in the Realms popular among bards who used the smoke they emitted to enhance their performances.
A single smoker was the size of a finger and made from incense. They belched smoke when tossed onto an open flame such as a brazier.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 3 gold pieces.
* Smokers were favored by bards.
