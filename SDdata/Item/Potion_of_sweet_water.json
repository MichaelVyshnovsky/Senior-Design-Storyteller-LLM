        "mainbody": "A '''''potion of sweet water''''', also known as simply '''''sweet water''''', was a liquid solution that could purify any liquid into a drinkable state.\n\n{{Quote|''Sweet water and light laughter until next''|A common farewell saying among [[elves]]<ref>}}",
        "Description": "Though not intended for consumption, those who had drank a ''potion of sweet water'' noted that it had a refreshing taste.",
        "Powers": "''Sweet water'' would neutralize any [[poison]]s within a liquid it was poured into, even [[drow knockout poison]]. If poured into a [[potion]], it would ruin its [[magic]]. One container of this could transform up to {{SI|100000|cubic feet|long=yes}} of polluted, [[salt]], or alkaline water into fresh water. It could also turn up to {{SI|1000|cubic feet|long=yes}} of [[acid]] into purified water. The effects of this potion were permanent.\n\nLater versions of ''sweet water'' were capable of nullifying both poisons and [[disease]]s present on any food that would be considered a light meal.\n\nIn addition, ingestion of this potion could halt the progression of a ''[[curse of forgetfulness]]''.",
        "Creation": "The sap of a [[silverbark]] was considered to be an essential ingredient for brewing ''sweet water''. Many of the possible ingredients were [[herb]]al in nature and could be used as alternatives to the rumored ingredient that was powdered [[unicorn]] horn. Overall, the process of creating ''sweet water'' took thirty minutes.\n\nWhen [[diamond]] dust was combined with certain substances in a secret process, it could also create a ''potion of sweet water''.",
        "Notable Users": {
            "Individuals": "* [[Mugly]]\n* [[Nasr-uddin]]\n* [[Tsepo Gart]]",
            "Races & Sentient Creatures": "* ''Sweet water'' was one of the many types of restorative potions that [[nymph]]s commonly owned.{{Cite dragon/240/Ecology of The Nymph|74}}"
        },
        "Usages": "* ''Sweet water'' was one of the many enchanted liquids known to be used in creating [[blueshine]].\n* ''Sweet water'' could be used to harm the water-adverse [[desert troll]]s.\n* This potion was a required ingredient for brewing ''[[Halaster's quaff]]''.\n* ''Sweet water'' could be used to neutralize the lingering musk on items sprayed on by [[skunk]]s.\n* ''Sweet water'' acted as a [[material component]] for a variety of [[spell]]s, including ''[[wandering symbol]]'', ''[[Obar's lesser purification]]'', and ''[[Azundel's purification]]''.",
        "Trivia": "* When injured, the [[avatar]] of the goddess [[Chauntea]] would gush forth ''sweet water'' rather than blood.\n* The spell ''[[moonveil]]'' was capable of nullifying this potion and rendering its taste foul.\n* The water and dew gathered from the glade at the heart of a [[Moonwell]] was said to display similar effects to ''sweet water''."
