'''Starwheels''', also known as '''wheel locks''' or '''wheel-locks''', that originated somewhere beyond [[Toril]].

==Description==
Unlike arquebuses, which had a match-lock mechanism,{{Cite dragon/70/A Second Volley|34}}

Starwheels typically weighed around {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Weaponology==
When its trigger was pressed, the pistol's wheel would spin and shower sparks into the enclosed pan where the [[smokepowder]] was held.

This weapon required only a single hand to operate and inflicted rather little damage, but compensated with an improved ability to aim accurately.

==Availability==
* These weapons were typically rather rare on Toril.
* Starwheels were sometimes sold or traded across Toril by [[spelljammer]] crews, such as the [[Smiths' Coster]] trading company, or stolen from those crews by [[thieves]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|37}} 
* One particular establishment on Toril where one could purchase starwheels was [[The Brigadier's Broadside]] in [[Skullport]].

==Prices==
On Toril in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a starwheel typically cost around 1,000 [[gold piece]]s.

In many areas of [[Wildspace]], these pistols would cost around 700 gold pieces, but on the [[Rock of Bral]] they sold for only 400 gold pieces.<ref>

==Notable Users==
===Classes===
* [[Gnome artificer]]s often wielded starwheels.
* [[Imperial Fleet Advisor|Advisors]] of the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]] often wielded starwheels.
===Individuals===
* [[Lancilon Seenabuck]]
* [[Morgan (pirate)|Captain Morgan]], a dreaded pirate that sailed the [[Dragon Reach]] in the 14{{th}} century DR, owned a wheel lock.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Morgan's Revenge|4,31-32}}
===Races & Sentient Creatures===
* Wealthy [[scro]] often owned and fought with starwheels.

==Reputation==
Many in Wildspace considered starwheels to be erratic and untrustworthy, on par with [[musket]]s.

==Trivia==
A starwheel over a shield was the symbol of the Smiths' Coster trading company.
