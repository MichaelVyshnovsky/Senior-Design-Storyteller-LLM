        "mainbody": "The '''''necklace of confidence''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] that boosted the wearer's self-esteem.",
        "Description": "The ''necklace of confidence'' featured single [[gemstone]] that blazed with searing bright shimmer.",
        "Powers": "Apart from magically boosting the wearer's self-esteem, the amulet also improved their will and defenses against magics that affected one's resolve and strength of determination.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the ''necklace of confidence'' could be found within a dried up well of magic water in the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The amulet was thrown in there at some point before or during the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[Weeping War]]. Later, the room with he well became haunted by bloodthirstily master [[wight]] and its four undead servants."
