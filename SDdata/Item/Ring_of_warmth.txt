A '''''ring of warmth''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[ring]] that protected its wearer against the effects of extremely cold temperatures.

==Powers==
A creature attuned to and wearing a ''ring of warmth'' was not bothered by ambient temperatures as low as {{SI|-50|F}} with no need for cold weather gear or clothing, as a result of the additional body heat magically generated by the ring. In addition, any items carried or worn by the wearer were also immune to those low temperatures. The ring also offered considerable protection against magical cold, greatly reducing any damage taken by the wearer from a cold source.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} a ''ring of warmth'' dating from the time of the [[Delzoun]] [[dwarves]] was located in a forgotten chamber of the [[Vault of Dragons]] beneath [[Waterdeep]], together with other treasures and dwarven relics.

==Notable Uses==
A pair of ''rings of warmth'' were kept in the kitchen of the [[House of the Moon]] temple of [[Sel√ªne]] in [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]]. These were used to safely enter the refrigerated pantry, which was kept chilly by a [[brown mold]]. One ring was worn by senior priest on duty, the other kept on a hook by the door.<ref>
