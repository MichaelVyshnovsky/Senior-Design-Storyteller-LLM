        "mainbody": "'''Pearl armor''' was a heavy and ornate type of [[armor]] fashioned by the [[shalarin]]s of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].",
        "Description": "Pearl armor had roughly the same durability and bulk as [[plate mail]], although it was much lighter. Still, the armor made swimming more difficult, and so it was rarely worn over the full body as this impediment to mobility was seen as outweighing its protective utility. Instead, it was usually worn only on the upper body (either as a tabbard over the full torso or just over the chest and one arm) or only on the lower body (as either a kilt, pants, or wrap).\n\nPearl armor was created by carefully inserting clothing&mdash;often woven from [[sheeps' coral]]&mdash;into the mouth of a [[giant clam]] and allowing it to sit for two months. At this point, it was removed and the shalarin used special [[spell]]s to harden the mucus-coated garments into tempered [[pearl]].",
        "Usage": "Pearl armor was one of two types of armor favored by the shalarin of [[Serôs]], the other being the much lighter [[silverweave armor]]. Pearl armor was the more ornamental of the two."
