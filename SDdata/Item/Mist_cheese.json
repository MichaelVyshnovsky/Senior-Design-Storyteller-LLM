        "mainbody": "Mist cheese, also called Loudwater mist and known as ethereal cheese to elves, was a rich cheese crafted in Loudwater Vale within the Savage Frontier.\nMist cheese was a soft white cheese with a unique taste and succulent bite. It was translucent if sliced thinly enough, hence its names.\nMist cheese was ripened in caves in the Loudwater Vale, which led to its distinct flavor and appearance.\nIt was sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. Mist cheese could be purchased only as a load weighing 1 lb (0.45 kg) for 2 gp.\nIn the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR, Sir Rivaldo was traveling in a coach along the Trade Way from the Way Inn to Waterdeep with an assortment of fine cheeses, including Loudwater mist."
