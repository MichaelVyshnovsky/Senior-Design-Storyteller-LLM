When a [[druid]] tapped into their ''symbiotic entity'' ability, the ''armor of the sporekeeper'' allowed them to spread [[bibberbang]] [[mushroom]] spores that created [[poison]]ous noxious clouds, [[timmask]] mushroom spores that poisoned and befuddled affected creatures, as well as ''[[haste spores]]'' that boosted allies' speed.

This set of unique armor was said to had once been enriched by a [[myconid]] sovereign's spores. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''armor of the sporekeeper'' ended up in the hands of a powerful [[mummy lord]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] â€“ the [[Mystic Carrion]]. The magic armor and its [[undead]] master could be found in [[Philgrave's Mansion]] in the Gate's [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]].
