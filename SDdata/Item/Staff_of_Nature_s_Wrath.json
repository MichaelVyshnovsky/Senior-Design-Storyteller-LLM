        "History": "The ''Staff of Nature's Wrath'' was crafted by a militant group of [[druid]]s of Silvanus. The enchanted weapon was used to clobber the enemies of the forest, dispense nature's punishment, and protect the dignity of druidic orders. The main targets of the ''Staff of Nature's Wrath'', however, were the [[cleric]]s of [[Malar]] and his fellow [[Gods of Fury]].\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], the ''Staff of Nature's Wrath'' was in the hands of [[Arundel]], the archdruid of [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]]. Later that year, Arundel was slain by [[Belhifet]], and his enchanted staff was picked up by the heroes of [[Icewind Dale]]."
