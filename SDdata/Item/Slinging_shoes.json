        "mainbody": "Slinging shoes were a pair of enchanted boots with some hits of sentience, created some time before the late 15 century DR.\nSlinging shoes possessed a simple enchantment that returned the boots back to their owners feet. However, somehow, these boots showed a genius streak by kicking their owner in the ankles every time they wore slippers or high-heeled shoes. Unexpectedly, the same enchantment that made them return also made them a good thrown weapon, and when the boots hit a target, they dealt additional psychic damage. While wearing the boots, the wearer also gained a slight boost to their nimbleness and reaction.\nIn the , a pair of such slinging shoes belonged to Tara, a tressym companion of the Waterdhavian mage Gale Dekarios, who followed him to the city of Baldurs Gate during the Absolute crisis. She was ready to exchange the boots with a face friendly to Gale in exchange for some fresh fish."
