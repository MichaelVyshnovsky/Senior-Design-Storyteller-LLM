        "Powers": "''Elixirs of half-orcish fury'' were distilled from the blood of [[half-orc]]s, allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with ''half-orcish fury'' – the ability to be relentless in battle and remain standing even after suffering the gravest of injuries. This blood-bound magic was expended after one day.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Araj Oblodra, an [[alchemist]] and a Blood Vendor, was using the blood of half-orcs infected with the [[illithid]] tadpoles of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in [[Moonrise Towers]]. After the death of [[Ketheric Thorm]], she returned to the Crimson Draughts – her apothecary in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], where she resumed her sanguinous magic experiments."
