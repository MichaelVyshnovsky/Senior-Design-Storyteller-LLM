'''''Protection from earth and stone''''' was a [[magic]]al [[scroll]] produced by the [[drow]] that was used to protect people from falling rocks.

==Powers==
Reading this scroll created a sphere {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in diameter around the user for three to twelve minutes and moved with the caster. Falling rocks and earth that entered the sphere slowed to the rate of things under a ''[[feather fall]]'' [[spell]] and guaranteed a soft landing, rendering them harmless. In fact, the affected objects behaved as though there was no gravity and could be moved with very little force.

A side effect of the sphere was that people within it fell as if they were under the effects of a ''feather fall'' spell, which allowed them to safely fall long distances. It did not hinder their normal movement and because objects that were not in touch with living creatures could not benefit from the ''feather fall'' effect, shooting or throwing objects functioned normally.

==History==
''Protection from earth and stone'' was a magical scroll that was uniquely found among the drow. Their [[cleric]]s and [[wizard]]s often created magical scrolls for their patrols. In the case of ''protection from earth and stone'', the purpose was to provide a means to protect them from cave-ins.
