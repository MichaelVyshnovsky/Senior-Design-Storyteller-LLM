        "mainbody": "A '''''griffon's claw''''' was an elaborately designed, [[magic]]al [[grappling hook]]. Its form resembled that of the claw of a [[raptor]].{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}",
        "Powers": "Upon uttering the claw's [[command word]], it would [[levitate]] into the air and fly towards an area denoted by its wielder up to {{SI|200|ft}} away. If it latched into a structure, such as a stone ledge or wood on the side of a ship, it was unmovable by non-magical means. The claw would only release its grasp upon a second command word being spoken."
