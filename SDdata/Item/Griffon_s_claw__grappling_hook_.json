        "mainbody": "A griffons claw was an elaborately designed, magical grappling hook. Its form resembled that of the claw of a raptor.\nUpon uttering the claws command word, it would levitate into the air and fly towards an area denoted by its wielder up to  away. If it latched into a structure, such as a stone ledge or wood on the side of a ship, it was unmovable by non-magical means. The claw would only release its grasp upon a second command word being spoken."
