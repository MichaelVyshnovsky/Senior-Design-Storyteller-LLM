        "mainbody": "'''Wire''' was a manufactured length of flexible metal, a \"coiled good\" alongside [[chain]] and [[rope]]. It was extremely useful and in wide demand across the [[Realms]] for everything from common tools to fancy [[jewelry]] to elaborate mechanisms.",
        "Description": "Wire was often quite brittle and soft from the drawing process, making it quite easy to snap under the right circumstances. Bending wire more than once in the same spot could snap it, and most wire produced was quite thick to ensure its durability.\n\nHard metals and alloys could respond poorly to being drawn into wire and become more fragile, while softer metals such as [[gold]] were the easiest to draw into fine wire. [[Adamant]] in particular was difficult to draw into wire because of its extreme brittleness, and had to be alloyed with [[molybdenum]] to make it usable.",
        "Availability": {
            "Trade": "[[File:Steel Wire Rings.png|thumb|''Steel wire rings.'']]\n* Thanks to the consistent demand, \"manygoods\" traders tried to keep at least some wire in their inventory, as well as a [[chisel]] and two pairs of [[pliers]] for cutting off lengths on demand.\n* [[Aurora's Emporium]] provided common wire by the foot (30 centimeters) in a variety of metals, including [[brass]], [[bronze]], [[copper]], gold, [[iron]], [[lead]], [[mithral]], [[platinum]], [[silver]], [[steel]], and [[tin]].\n* [[Gleskur's Finemetals of Secomber]] produced fine, braided copper wire.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}}\n* The [[Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths]] and the [[Jewelers' Guild]] of [[Waterdeep]] made, traded, and used wire for sculpting and ornamentation.\n* [[Mhaer's Alley]] in Waterdeep had a great concentration of shops that sold tailoring supplies, including fine wire.\n* [[Rallogar Hardware]] in [[Wheloon]] sold all sorts of tools and supplies, including great stocks of rope, cable, and wire.\n* [[Nelzol's Notions]] in [[Immersea]] sold various hardware supplies, including coils of fine wire.\n* The [[Chandlers Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] oversaw maritime tools and equipment, including the development of new kinds of wired cable.\n* The city of [[Khôltar]] was devoted to metalworking, and the shop of [[Oraundro Nempeth's]] sold rope, cord, twine, wire, tying rings, and chain.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|77}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}"

        "History": "Thread-of-gold was an exceptionally fine wire made by ancient [[dwarves]], though the process of crafting it was long lost to modern dwarves.\n\nWire was made by the ancient human peoples of Faerûn, including the [[Rengarth]] of [[Netheril]] thousands of years before {{yearlinkConvert|0|NY}}, and by the people of [[Calimshan]] by [[-6048 DR]].\n\nThe consistent production of fine wire in Faerûn was still a developing art by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], as artisans continued to gradually refine the process over time. It was expected to still be an area of experimentation and notable improvements through to the mid–16{{th}} century DR.\n\nCable—rope woven around wire—was first developed around the mid-14{{th}} century DR."
