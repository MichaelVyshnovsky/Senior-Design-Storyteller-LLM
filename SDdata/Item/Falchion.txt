A falchion () was type of large, single-edged, two-handed sword.
The falchion looked much like a big scimitar with a wide blade curved toward the tip. The blade was one-sided and heavy, weighing as much as some greatswords. The pommel, cross guard, and grip were similar to a bastard sword.
The heavy blade of the falchion gave it an almost axe-like ability to chop through armor and yet retained the advantages of a sword. Its weight required two hands and special training to wield effectively, so it was therefore considered a martial weapon.
