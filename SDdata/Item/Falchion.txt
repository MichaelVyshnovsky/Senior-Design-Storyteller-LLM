A '''falchion''' ({{Pronounce|FAL|chun|refs={{Cite web/Dungeons & Dragons FAQ}}}}) was type of large, single-edged, two-handed sword.

==Description==
The falchion looked much like a big [[scimitar]] with a wide blade curved toward the tip. The blade was one-sided and heavy, weighing as much as some [[greatsword]]s. The pommel, cross guard, and grip were similar to a [[bastard sword]].

The heavy blade of the falchion gave it an almost axe-like ability to chop through armor and yet retained the advantages of a sword. Its weight required two hands and special training to wield effectively, so it was therefore considered a martial weapon.

==Notable Falchions==
* ''[[Decision]]'', a unique [[enchanted]] [[flaming]] falchion.
* The ''[[Fang of Zehir|Fangs of Zehir]]'' were four enchanted [[adamantine]] falchions.
