Zeskorr was a type of ale, or "small beer" popular in the late 15 century DR.
Zeskorr was a pale ale of dark brown color with salty taste. It was an acquired taste, thought by some to taste fishy or just strange. For an inexperienced imbiber, Zeskorr could cause an upset stomach, however, many found deep enjoyment in the strange libation.
Zeskorr was popular among merchants and traders and was found commonly on the Sword Coast, all along the Trade Way, as far north as the city of Luskan.
