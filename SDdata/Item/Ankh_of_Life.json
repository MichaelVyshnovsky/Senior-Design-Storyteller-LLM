        "mainbody": "The '''''ankh of life''''' was a powerful [[artifact]] that was a [[holy symbol]] of the manifestation of [[Re]].",
        "Description": "The ''ankh'' was worn and covered with dirt. It was made from [[birch]] and measured {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} in length.",
        "Powers": "This artifact could use the following powers—''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' twice per day, ''[[restoration]]'' three times per day, ''[[regenerate]]'' three times per day, ''[[destroy undead|destroy undead, 30' radius]]'' three times per day, and ''[[continual light]]'' at will. However, these great powers came with a steep cost. Using any of these powers, aside from ''continual light'', permanently drained a portion of the wielder's experiences and memories. This was only restorable via a ''[[wish]]''.",
        "History": "The ''ankh of life'' was lost during the [[Orcgate Wars]]. Clergy of both [[Horus-Re]] and [[Osiris]] searched desparately for the artifact so they could place it with a manifestation of Re within the [[Tower of Eternity]] in [[skuld]]."
