When the soldier was wounded during the battle, the nymph came to him, pulled her heart out from her chest, and then placed it upon his hand. The heart changed into a gem, and Neely disappeared, never to be heard or seen again by her beloved. The warrior kept the gem as treasure, passed down through generations of his family.\nAs of 1372 DR, the Heart of Neely was in the possession of the priest named Gilford, who made it available to buy from his shop in the village of Hilltop in the Silver Marches."
