'''Pyrite''', also known as '''iron pyrite''' or '''fool's gold''', was a golden-hued mineral{{Cite web enhancement/Raiders of the High Citadel|5}} containing [[iron]].{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...}}

==Description==
With its yellow-metallic sheen, pyrite resembled [[gold]] to the uninitiated eye, but was much less valuable than the precious metal. Deposits of fool's gold however did sometimes contain a certain amount of real gold. Pyrite also appeared in small quantities within [[lapis lazuli]], giving the blue ornamental stone its golden flecks.<ref>{{Cite dragon/83/The many facets of gems}}<ref>{{Cite dragon/248/Crystal Confusion}}

==Trade==
Iron pyrite was commonly available at many towns and markets. It was sold by ''[[Aurora's Emporium]]'' in the 1360s DR.

==Uses==
Pyrite could be smelted to yield the iron it contained.

Pyrite was one of the reflective materials used by the [[dao]] to decorate their capital on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], the [[Sevenfold Mazework]], and help with its illumination.<ref><ref>

===Magical Uses===
Iron pyrite was common stock in a reasonably equipped [[wizard]]'s laboratory.

It was the material component for the spells ''[[Leomund's trap]]'',<ref><ref><ref> and  ''[[cone of earth]]''.<ref>{{Cite dragon/250/Arcane Lore: Secrets of the Arch-Geomancer}}

The ''[[conical hat]]'', an [[Imaskar]]i relic dangerous to the wearer's mind found in [[Solon]] around [[1360 DR]], was made of iron pyrite.<ref><ref>

==Religious Significance==
The discovery of iron  pyrite was sent as a portent by [[Waukeen]] to her faithful,<ref> as well as a sign of displeasure by either [[Dumathoin]] or [[Vergadain]] to their [[Dwarf|dwarven]] followers.<ref>

==Trivia==
*The [[Iulutiun]]s used so-called spark stones resembling pyrite to light their fires in the cold of the [[Great Glacier]]. These could be found mostly in the [[Novularond]].<ref>
*According to some tales, the [[Gilded Nugget]], the founding price of the [[Gnome|gnomish]] nation of [[Songfarla]], was an enormous piece of iron pyrite.<ref>
