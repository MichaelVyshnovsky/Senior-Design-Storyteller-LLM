A '''''golden sickle''''' was a [[magic]]al [[sickle]] unique to the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Powers==
In combat, it could be wielded as a ''sickle +2''. 

The [[weapon]] also had a limited number of charges. At the cost of one charge, the wielder could use the sickle to cast a ''[[plant door]]'' [[spell]], with a few differences from the normal [[druid]]ic version. The sylvan door or pathway always lasted ten minutes and could be used by others, not just the wielder. The path created could measure up to 120 feet (37 meters) in length.

At no cost in charges, the wielder was empowered to ''[[pass without trace]]'' as the druid spell provided that he or she could concentrate upon it while doing so.
