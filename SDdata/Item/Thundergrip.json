        "mainbody": "Thundergrip, or Thundergrip gauntlets, were a pair of enchanted gloves from the ruins of the City of Song, Myth Drannor.\nThundergrip were gloves decorated with iron rivets.\nThese magic gloves caused the wearer to deal greater damage through hand-to-hand combat or when wielding metallic weapons, similarly to weapons with a +2 enchantment. Additionally, they allowed the wearer to cast the shocking grasp spell at will. These gloves held at least four charges of the spell.\nThe origins of these enchanted gloves were shrouded in mystery. However, one thing was knownâ€”they originated from the ruins of the elven city of Myth Drannor. By the , the gloves were found by a clan of ormyrr, who, like many of their kin, were obsessed with collecting items of magical power. The gloves owner was Samaj of the Sharpstick clan, who dwelled in the Dwarven Dungeons of the ruined city. Samaj was willing to trade his magic items with peaceful adventurers were they to find themselves in the dangerous ruins."
