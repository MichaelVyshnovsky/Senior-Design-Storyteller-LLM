'''''Svartlebee's Woundseeker''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[greatsword]] that once was famously wielded by [[Svartlebee|Svartlebee the Custodian]], sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Woundseeker'' possessed a minor ''+1'' enchantment that guided the blade towards the target and increased its deadliness. Additionally, the weapon was especially effective against opponents who had already suffered damageâ€”each subsequent slash with the blade resulted in it deepening the wounds, in turn causing heavier damage and leaving bleeding lacerations behind.

==History==
The ''Woundseeker'' belonged to Svartlebee the Custodian, a [[mercenary]] who used the weapon to remove nuisances from people's lives and cleaned up the crime scenes afterwards. Subsequently, the blade changed owners, eventually falling into the hands of the [[Flaming Fist]] Gauntlet [[Yeva (Flaming Fist)|Yeva]], who accompanied Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] on a mission to [[Elturel]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, and survived an attack from the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the [[Waukeen's Rest]] roadside inn.
