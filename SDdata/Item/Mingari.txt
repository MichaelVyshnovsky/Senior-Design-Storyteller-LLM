Mingari was a rare and exotic spice exported from Ulgarth around 1367 DR.
This strong spice was similar to cinnamon in flavor. When blended with fruit from Maztica, delicious ketjap was created. It needed to be blended, and was typically stored and sold in jars.
Mingari was farmed in eastern Ulgarth, particularly around Kaspar and east of Kelazzan. It was traded through Orvyltar to Durpar, where the Karakil chaka in Morvar had a primary interest in the mingari trade. The Durpari shipped the mingari across the Shining South.
Throughout all of Toril, mingari was only grown and blended in Ulgarth, who only traded it to Durpar, giving those countries a nice monopoly on the supply of the favored spice, which was just being discovered by wider Faer√ªn around 1367 DR. It was Ulgarths primary export.
