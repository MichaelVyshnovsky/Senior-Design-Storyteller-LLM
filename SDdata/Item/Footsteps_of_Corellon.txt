The '''''Footsteps of Corellon''''' were enchanted [[boot]]s from [[Waterdeep]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Footsteps of Corellon'' possessed a powerful enchantment that allowed the wearer to ''[[heal]]'' friends, with a coin toss of a chance, as they moved past the allies.

==History==
The ''Footsteps of Corellon'' were a gif from [[Laeral Silverhand]] to Halbenet sometime in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She knew that the [[elf|elven]] cleric loved walking as much as they loved to dress in finery and helping people in need, so she found the prefect gift that allowed the [[moon elf]] to do all three things at the same time.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Halbenet Soladonel]]: a moon elf [[cleric]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
