The Footsteps of Corellon were enchanted boots from Waterdeep, in the late 15 century DR.
The Footsteps of Corellon possessed a powerful enchantment that allowed the wearer to heal friends, with a coin toss of a chance, as they moved past the allies.
The Footsteps of Corellon were a gif from Laeral Silverhand to Halbenet sometime in the 15 century DR. She knew that the elven cleric loved walking as much as they loved to dress in finery and helping people in need, so she found the prefect gift that allowed the moon elf to do all three things at the same time.
*Halbenet Soladonel a moon elf cleric of Corellon Larethian who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR.
