The '''''claw of Nezram''''' was a unique [[magic item]] [[enchanted]] by the [[wizard]] [[Nezram]].

==Description==
The ''claw'' was a replica of a [[humanoid]] hand that was made from [[ivory]] and studded with [[rubies]]. Sharp talons stood in place of regular fingernails.

==Powers==
The ''claw'' was an intelligent sentient item that initially battled the will of anyone trying to control it.

The ''claw of Nezram'' possessed several powers. The most mundane of these was scratching any itch the wielder had when commanded to do so. The ''claw'' could be order to attack enemies in combat, slashing at them and attempting to grip their throats where it would squeeze until the target died. If the ''claw'' latched onto a target's weapon hand then they were unable to use that hand in combat. The ''claw'' could also glow red if rubies were nearby.

==History==
Five ''claws of Nezram'' were known to exist. All were held in the possession of the powerful wizard [[Hodkamset]].
