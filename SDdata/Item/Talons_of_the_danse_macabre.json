        "mainbody": "The '''''talons of the danse macabre''''' were an [[enchanted]] pair of [[eagle]] talons that attacked enemies.",
        "Description": "The ''talons'' were plated in dull [[silver]] resembling pewter.",
        "Powers": "If two of the ''talons'' were thrown and the proper [[command word]] was uttered, the ''talons'' would immediately attack a selected target. The ''talons'' would slash at a target for ten minutes before becoming inactive for a full day before they could be used again. The ''talons of the danse macabre'' were indestructible in combat, but could be dismissed with the proper command word or a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "These [[magic item]]s were initially created by [[priest]]s of [[Assuran]] in [[Chessenta]]. Eight pairs were created."
