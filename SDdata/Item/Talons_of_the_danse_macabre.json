        "mainbody": "he talons of the danse macabre were an enchanted pair of eagle talons that attacked enemies.\nThe talons were plated in dull silver resembling pewter.\nIf two of the talons were thrown and the proper command word was uttered, the talons would immediately attack a selected target. The talons would slash at a target for ten minutes before becoming inactive for a full day before they could be used again. The talons of the danse macabre were indestructible in combat, but could be dismissed with the proper command word or a successful dispel magic spell.\nThese magic items were initially created by priests of Assuran in Chessenta. Eight pairs were created."
