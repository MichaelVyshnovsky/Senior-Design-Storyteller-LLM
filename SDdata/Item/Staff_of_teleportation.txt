A '''''staff of teleportation''''' was a staff with the power to teleport small objects. One of them was in the [[Mobius Tower]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|122}}

==Powers==
These staves could teleport objects of up to {{SI|20|pounds|k}}, simply by touching the staff to the object while picturing where it would go.

==Notable Staves==
An [[efreet]] guarded one that hung on a wall in the [[Mobius Tower]] as of {{yearlink|1356}}. That particular staff had only five charges left.
