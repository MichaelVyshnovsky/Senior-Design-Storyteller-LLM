        "mainbody": "Ashaba Dusk was a variety of red wine, produced in Sembia. It was exported as far as the Western Heartlands, the lands along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate, as of the late 15 century DR.\nNamed after the River Ashaba that crossed the Dalelands and Sembia, this red wine was somewhat flat in flavor, yet \"charmingly plucky.\" The wine was sold in simple green glass unlabeled bottles."
