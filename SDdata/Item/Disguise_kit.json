        "Description": "A typical disguise kit consisted of a pouch with cosmetics, [[dye]]s, and assorted objects that supported the role to be impersonated.\n\nSpecial disguise kits sold by [[Aurora's Emporium]] also included fake facial hair that could be attached to the user's face using tree sap, which was included in a [[vial]] within the kit. They also came with blocks of [[coal]] and [[chalk]] to darken and lighten facial details, a wad of [[clay]] that could be molded to change facial features, a felt hat that could assume different shapes, and a [[linen]] coif that could be used as a hood.",
