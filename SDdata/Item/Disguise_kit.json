They also came with blocks of coal and chalk to darken and lighten facial details, a wad of clay that could be molded to change facial features, a felt hat that could assume different shapes, and a linen coif that could be used as a hood.\n* Naomlen Girdaur, a dwarven rogue and Zhentarim assassin."
