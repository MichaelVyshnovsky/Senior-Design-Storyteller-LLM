This enchanted staff belonged to Thyaast Ammath, an elven wizard who venerated the art of necromancy. She survived the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War and continued her work in developing magics that could raise the dead. Eventually, she reached the state of lichdom and over the centuries that followed, suffered from deteriorating mental state. She kept Thyaasts staff close at hand as she haunted her ancient laboratory at the very bottom of the Elven Catacombs, by the chasm that led into the Underdark. In 1369 DR, the staff could be found within the lichs lair, guarded by its mistress and her undead horrors.
