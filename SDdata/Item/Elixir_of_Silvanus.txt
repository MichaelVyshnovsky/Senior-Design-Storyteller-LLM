An '''''Elixir of Silvanus''''' was a powerful curative [[potion]] that could cure many [[poison]]s.

==Description==
Such tonics were kept in dark jars with hempen [[rope]] tied around their neck. They were said to be blessed by [[Silvanus]] himself, and could cure even the most lethal poisons, the poison from the thorns of [[Kelemvor's Kiss]].

==Preparation==
The ''Elixir of Silvanus'' was created by boiling a bundle of [[mugwort]] in a pot-full of theriac antidote, as per instructions listed in the botanical book ''[[Flora of the Dalelands]]''.
