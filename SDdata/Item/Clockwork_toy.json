        "mainbody": "'''Clockwork toys''', sometimes known simply as '''clockworks''', were small delicate mechanical figures created for recreational means.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2008)/03-30 - Toys of the Realms}} though some of the industrious [[rock gnome]]s of [[Toril]] were also known to craft them, as were the [[tinker gnome]]s of [[Krynn]].",
        "Description": "Clockwork toys were created in a variety of different forms. Many were crafted in the shape of animals,\n\nThey were made of metal, such as [[brass]] or [[gold]]. And their delicate shells were crammed full of [[spring]]s, [[wire]]s, and other clockwork that enabled them to walk, fly, or swim for short distances. Some even emitted imitations of the sounds of creatures they were crafted to resemble.\n\nSome clockwork toys took on more esoteric forms. One such example from the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] was that of [[egg]]-shaped jewelry boxes, which had several layers that rotated within each other, and played tunes like a [[music box]]. Through their revolutions these layers would reveal elaborated etched or painted scenes. Commonly depicted scenes included such things as royal feasts, men dueling with [[sword]]s, or [[skeleton]]s within a [[dungeon]] escaping from the confines of their [[shackles]].",
        "Availability": "* A great deal of the [[Church of Gond]]'s temples were known to sell clockwork toys, typically at high prices, by the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold a wide variety of Gondsmen crafted clockwork toys imported from [[Lantan]] and tested thoroughly by their salespeople to ensure each toy functioned properly, though the catalogue claimed that this was also because the salespeople themselves enjoyed playing with them. These toys measured {{SI|2|in}} in length and were shaped like mundane animals. Their metal bodies were notably painted and draped with streamers. The catalogue sold these individually for 2 [[gold piece]]s a piece, but also offered buying bundles at a price of 10 or 15 gold pieces.\n* [[Bunsen’s Clockwork Shop]], a small shop in the heart of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ravens Bluff/Market District|Merchant District]] operated by the Gondar priest [[Bunsen|Father Bunsen]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/To Protect and Serve|3}} carried hundreds of ornate brass and gold clockwork toys. Kept well polished, these toys lined the walls of Bunsen's shop from within display shelves. In addition to animals, they took the forms of dragons, [[dwarves]], [[elves]], soldiers, and a wide array of monsters.{{Cite organized play/LC/To Protect and Serve|5}}\n* [[Firestorm House]], one of the Merchant Houses of Ravens Bluff, sold clockwork toys throughout the [[Eastern Heartlands]].<ref>\n* The [[House of Cloevaerus]], a mercantile company in Ravens Bluff that imported clockworks and similar contraptions, through struggled under the fierce competition of Firestorm House.<ref>\n* [[Thimblewine's Pawnshop]], a shop in [[Waterdeep]] operated by the rock gnome [[Krystaleen]], sold clockwork toys for 50 [[gp]] a piece.{{Cite adventurers league/The Skull Square Murders|6}}\n* The [[Toysmiths]], a toyshop in Ravens Bluff that was owned and operated by the [[gnome]] brothers [[Gunder Gaewilder|Gunder]] and [[Relvan Gaewilder]], sold intricate clockwork toys that they sold at a high prices  to [[Sembian]]s and [[Waterdhavian]]s. These toys took the form of life-like [[bird]]s or other small animals, crafted from gold and with [[gem]]s for eyes.\n* In the land of [[Zakhara]], clockwork toys were commonly created by [[clockwork mage]]s.",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Spellplague]] era, the Lantan's supply and sale of such contraptions on mainland [[Faerûn]] was more limited in scope.\n\nFor a time it was considered quite fashionable among [[Cormyrean]] nobles to gift King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] one of the intricate clockwork toys crafted by the Gaewilder brothers of Ravens Bluff, until Azoun himself grew tiresome of the fad and would sigh loudly whenever he was presented with another.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century DR, after a consortium of [[Lantanese]] [[gnome]]-ran merchant organizations established the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'', the gnomes provided the local [[Samarach]]ans new methods of ''illusory defenses'' and the wonders of Lantanese clockwork toys.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of Lantan:Lantan to Samarach}}",
        "Notable Owners": "* The Ravenian merchant [[Bendekar]] kept a collection of clockwork toys among the hoards of miscellaneous goods he kept in [[Bendekar's House|his residence]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Handful of Dust|46}}\n* [[Einrich Thomas]], a Gondar priest and member of [[The Turning Wheel]] clergy in Ravens Bluff, devoted much of his time to creating clockwork toys for children and over time had created roughly thousands of them. Whenever [[Winterfest]] came around, he would go from door to door in the city passing out his creations to the Ravenian children.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/135/City Stories: The Temple of Gond|12}}\n* The [[Falinescu]] family of [[Barovia]] owned some clockwork toys.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Marionette|15}}\n* The [[Industrious Brothers and Sisters of Carpentry, Cabinetry, Puppetry, and Toymaking]].While it is not detailed what types of crafts this religious ordered devoted themselves to, outside of those listed in its name, it can be inferred that clockwork toys were most likely part of their repertoire on account of Gondsmen-made clockwork toys being widely documented across other sources."
