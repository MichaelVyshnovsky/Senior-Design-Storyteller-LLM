        "mainbody": "A crowbar, pry bar, or prying bar, was a tool used by dungeoneers and criminals to pry objects apart and for general demolition.\nThese tools were essentially iron bars designed in a way to pry open chests or doors. They could be forged by blacksmiths via the use of molds or potentially found on a robe of useful items. Crowbars could also be used as improvised bludgeoning weapons. \nCrowbars were a part of standard adventuring gear, and when their leverage was applied, they could break open locks. and dungeoneers packs.\nThese implements were smithed and sold in various places across Faer√ªn. \n* The Conyberry Arms sold particularly poor equipment, such as locks that could only be opened with crowbars, and naturally, crowbars themselves.\n* The Iron Bull Smithy in Ravens Bluff sold crowbars for 6 gold pieces.\nIn the 14 century DR, Aurils followers in Mirabar begun to act very strangely. They started to attack their temples walls with prybars and pickaxes, potentially searching for a sacred treasure.\n* Asilther Graelor, the Harper thief"
