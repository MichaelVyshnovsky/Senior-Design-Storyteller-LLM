        "mainbody": "rayclaws were a set of claw-like weapons favored by the Grayclaws thieves guild of Tantras, who took their name from these blades.\nGrayclaws consisted of a set of leather gauntlets that strapped to the hand fitted with brass knuckles, from which projected razor-sharp blades. They were similar to the bagh nakh wielded in some eastern lands.The Indian bagh nakh were statted for 3rd-edition D&D in the Arms and Equipment Guide. This also presents the nekode, a similar weapon with a bonus to climbing, which might be considered equivalent to grayclaws in 3rd edition.\nGrayclaws were a slashing weapon, lightly damaging but fast. A trained user could be dangerous in battle, and Grayclaws thieves, specialized in their use, could deliver a devastating sneak attack on their targets.\nThe claws had another use in gripping surfaces while climbing, enabling the wearer to climb faster and more surely. A Grayclaws thief could use them to scale a wall with ease. However, they tended to hamper the wearers hand movements in other areas, and they could not be donned or doffed quickly.\nA set of grayclaws typically cost 3 gold pieces, though they were rarely available on the open market."
