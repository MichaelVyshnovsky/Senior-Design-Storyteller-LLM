        "mainbody": "'''Grayclaws''' were a set of claw-like weapons favored by the [[Grayclaws]] [[thieves]]' [[guild]] of [[Tantras]], who took their name from these blades.",
        "Description": "Grayclaws consisted of a set of leather gauntlets that strapped to the hand fitted with brass knuckles, from which projected razor-sharp blades. They were similar to the [[bagh nakh]] wielded in some eastern lands.The Indian [[bagh nakh]] were statted for 3rd-edition D&D in the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]''. This also presents the [[nekode]], a similar weapon with a bonus to climbing, which might be considered equivalent to grayclaws in 3rd edition.",
        "Abilities": "Grayclaws were a slashing weapon, lightly damaging but fast. A trained user could be dangerous in battle, and Grayclaws thieves, specialized in their use, could deliver a devastating sneak attack on their targets.\n\nThe claws had another use in gripping surfaces while climbing, enabling the wearer to climb faster and more surely. A Grayclaws thief could use them to scale a wall with ease. However, they tended to hamper the wearer's hand movements in other areas, and they could not be donned or doffed quickly.",
        "Availability": "A set of grayclaws typically cost 3 [[gold piece]]s, though they were rarely available on the open market."
