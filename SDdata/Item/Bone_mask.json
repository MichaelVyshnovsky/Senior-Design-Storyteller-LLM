        "mainbody": "A '''''bone mask''''' was a mask formed in the shape of a skull, made from the powdered bones gathered from any sort of animal or creature.",
        "Powers": "The wearer of the mask was immune to the effects that accompanied the attacks of [[undead]] creatures, such as those that chilled, withered, aged and drained the life of their foes. Furthermore the non-physical powers of [[demilich]]es, such as ''[[death ray]]'', ''[[trap the soul]]'' and ''[[Bane (spell)|curse]]'' were nullified.\n\nFurthermore, the wearer of a ''bone mask'' could ''[[turn undead]]'' as if they were a powerful [[cleric]] and could ''[[animate dead]]'' by touch alone.\n\nOnce per day the wearer could conjure a [[spectral messenger]], a non-corporeal entity that resembled a bat. This being flew to a chosen recipient that resided on the same [[plane of existence]] as the mask's wearer and repeat a message of 33 words or less. While this message could not include [[spell]] incantations, it could include a [[command word]] that activated some [[Item enchantment|magical]] item.",
