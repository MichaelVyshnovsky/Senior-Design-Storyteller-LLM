        "mainbody": "A bone mask was a mask formed in the shape of a skull, made from the powdered bones gathered from any sort of animal or creature.\nThe wearer of the mask was immune to the effects that accompanied the attacks of undead creatures, such as those that chilled, withered, aged and drained the life of their foes. Furthermore the non-physical powers of demiliches, such as death ray, trap the soul and curse were nullified.\nFurthermore, the wearer of a bone mask could turn undead as if they were a powerful cleric and could animate dead by touch alone.\nOnce per day the wearer could conjure a spectral messenger, a non-corporeal entity that resembled a bat. This being flew to a chosen recipient that resided on the same plane of existence as the masks wearer and repeat a message of 33 words or less. While this message could not include spell incantations, it could include a command word that activated some magical item.\n* Fzoul Chembryl Chosen of Bane and leader of the Zhentarim"
