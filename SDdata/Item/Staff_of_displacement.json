        "mainbody": "A staff of displacement was a magical staff that, when held by up to three beings, acted as a cloak of displacement and offered +2 protection to the wielders.\nThe staff could also, at-will, allow one of the wielders to leap into the air as per the spell jump. Additionally, it allowed the wielder, upon utterance of the command word, to part water in a shape 5 (1.5 m) high and 4 (1.2 m) outward, allowing for underwater breathing. Lastly, it could temporarily negate, although not outright destroy, any wizard lock or hold portal spell effects."
