        "mainbody": "ark was a crudely named stew served at the Copper Coronet tavern of Athkatla in the 14 century DR.\nThe word \"sark\" was a crude expletive and an apt name for the dish. Sark was a stew cooked with Athkatlan harbor water and various unsavory leavings of the River District, like fish guts, catfish carcasses, cheap mussels, dog cadavers, rats, and dew-worms. The concoction was flavored with various herbs picked in the Grave District and served in hollowed-out stale moldy bread bowls.\nSarks were a popular but foul creation of Old Skratha, the cook of the Copper Coronet in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. These dishes were the only food available at the tavern and the only food its clientele could afford. Skratha was known to slip poison into a serving of the stew if compensated accordingly."
