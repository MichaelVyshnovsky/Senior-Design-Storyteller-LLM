The Brainscrambler was a unique enchanted morningstar custom-made for the mercenary named Skullcrusher from the city of Phlan in the 14 century DR.
The Brainscrambler was a simple-looking weapon made of solid oak wood and bound in high-quality steel. The weapon was marked by its creator.
The morning star possessed a simple +1 enchantment that enhanced the wielders aim and improved the damage dealt. Upon each successful hit, the Brainscrambler had a chance of damaging the targets mental capabilities, draining wisdom, and leaving them disoriented and confused.
Skullcrusher commissioned the creation of the Brainscrambler from a master smith with unique specifications sometime after the mercenarys departure from Phlan in the . He carried the magic weapon into countless adventures and mercenary jobs across the Dragon Reach, the Dalelands, and the Moonsea until retiring in a cottage within the Neverwinter Wood. In his advanced age, Skullcrusher was willing to gift the morning star to a fellow adventurer the mercenary thought it to be better than letting some monster or looter claim the Brainscrambler after his death.
