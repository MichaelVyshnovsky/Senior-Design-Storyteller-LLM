The '''''Brainscrambler''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[morningstar]] custom-made for the mercenary named [[Skullcrusher (Phlan)|Skullcrusher]] from the city of [[Phlan]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Brainscrambler'' was a simple-looking weapon made of solid [[oak]] wood and bound in high-quality [[steel]]. The weapon was marked by its creator.

==Powers==
The morning star possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that enhanced the wielder's aim and improved the damage dealt. Upon each successful hit, the ''Brainscrambler'' had a chance of damaging the target's mental capabilities, draining wisdom, and leaving them disoriented and confused.

==History==
Skullcrusher commissioned the creation of the ''Brainscrambler'' from a master smith with unique specifications sometime after the mercenary's departure from Phlan in the {{YearlinkName|1340}}. He carried the magic weapon into countless adventures and mercenary jobs across the [[Dragon Reach]], the [[Dalelands]], and the [[Moonsea]] until retiring in a cottage within the [[Neverwinter Wood]]. In his advanced age, Skullcrusher was willing to gift the morning star to a fellow adventurer; the mercenary thought it to be better than letting some monster or looter claim the ''Brainscrambler'' after his death.
