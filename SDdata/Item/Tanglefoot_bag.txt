'''Tanglefoot bags''' were a means of throwing an [[Alchemist|alchemical]] goo to entangle an enemy.

==Description==
A tanglefoot bag was usually round and made of leather and weighed about {{SI|4|pounds|k|long=yes}}. It was designed in such a way as to open up when thrown to disperse the thick goo inside. The goo hardened rapidly when it came into contact with air, so if it splashed over a creature, it could effectively [[glue]] that being to the ground.

A standard tanglefoot bag contained enough alchemical goo to cover a large creature. If thrown upon a flying creature, it would harden around wings and prevent flight. The goo would not harden underwater; it required contact with air.

The hardened goo quickly became brittle after as little as a dozen seconds or so and cracked apart. [[Universal solvent]] quickly dissolved it.

==Crafting==
Skill in alchemy was required to make a tanglefoot bag. 

==Availability==
Tanglefoot bags were typically sold in alchemists' shops for around 50 [[gold piece]]s.
* [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]] in [[Red Larch]], being a business run by an alchemist, sold tanglefoot bags.{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|84}}
* [[Almaes the Alchemist's shop]] in [[Ashabenford]] sold tanglefoot bags.
* [[Valas Jaelre]], a [[drow]] [[wizard]], sold tanglefoot bags to other drow in [[Cormanthor]].
* Tanglefoot bags could also be purchased from the [[gnome]]s of [[Thunderstone]].

==Notable Users==
===Groups===
* The [[Howling Wing]], a band of [[kir-lanan]], often used tanglefoot bags against flying opponents.
* The armies of the [[Nine Hells]] often used tanglefoot bags against winged [[angel]]s and [[Celestial archon|archons]].
===Races & Sentient Creatures===
*[[Githyanki]]: this militaristic race of creatures from outside of [[Toril]] was known to arm their soldiers and captains with several types of thrown weapons, including tanglefoot bags and [[thunderstone (item)|''thunderstones'']].
