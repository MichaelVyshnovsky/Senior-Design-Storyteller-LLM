Tanglefoot bags were a means of throwing an alchemical goo to entangle an enemy.
A tanglefoot bag was usually round and made of leather and weighed about . It was designed in such a way as to open up when thrown to disperse the thick goo inside. The goo hardened rapidly when it came into contact with air, so if it splashed over a creature, it could effectively glue that being to the ground.
A standard tanglefoot bag contained enough alchemical goo to cover a large creature. If thrown upon a flying creature, it would harden around wings and prevent flight. The goo would not harden underwater it required contact with air.
The hardened goo quickly became brittle after as little as a dozen seconds or so and cracked apart. Universal solvent quickly dissolved it.
Skill in alchemy was required to make a tanglefoot bag.
