An '''evermemory''' [[ring]] was a specific type of ''[[ring of wizardry]]'' that was crafted by an old [[Amn]]ian [[wizard]].

==Powers==
This type of ring allowed its wearer to cast additional [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]]s each day. Some increased the number of lower-level spells available to a mage,

==History==
The creator of these rings was rumored to have [[arcane]] powers that defied the rules and limitation set by the goddess of magic herself, [[Mystra]]. Eventually the "everlasting memory" this mage possessed was revealed to be a hoax, and the source of his magical prowess was revealed to have come from the rings he bore.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Sunin]], the [[Baldurian]] [[conjurer]]
