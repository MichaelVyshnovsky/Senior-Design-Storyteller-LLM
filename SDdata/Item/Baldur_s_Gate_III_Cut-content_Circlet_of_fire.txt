A circlet of fire was a variety of magical circlet that benefited spellcasters that wielded fire magic in battle.
The circlet imbued its wearer with feelings of inner strength and intense anger.
Whenever the wearer of a circlet of fire harmed another being with a non-cantrip fire spell, they were filled with a sense of urgency. They felt as if they could get more done in the heat of battle.
