'''Belarris''' was a [[poison]] that was widely available in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Belarris was a black, oily liquid that was made from [[wyvern]] blood mixed with the sap from six different types of plants and the essence of the barks from two different types of trees. This poison could be added to food and retained its potency even if it was added before cooking.

==Effects==
Soon after ingesting this poison, a susceptible victim felt a wave of extreme fatigue. If unchecked, the victim soon fell unconscious for several minutes.
