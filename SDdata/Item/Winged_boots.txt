Winged boots were enchanted footwear that allowed the wearer to fly through the air.
These boots would sprout wings if the wearer concentrated on flying. Flight could be maintained without concentrating for up to two hours per day. If the boots energy depleted, the wearer would be gently lowered to the ground. Winged boots came in a variety of kinds with varying degrees of speed and aerial maneuverability.

* Hermes, the Olympian deity of travelers, wore a pair of winged sandals.
* Larloch, the powerful and ancient lich wore a pair of winged boots.
* Little Wing, a kenku assassin of the Cult of the Howling Hatred.
