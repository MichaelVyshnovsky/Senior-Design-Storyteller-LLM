Buckle knives were a variety of enchanted concealed knives with a unique hilt.
These knives were so named because their hilt resembled an ornament typically found on belt buckles. Because of this, buckles were also typically used like a sheath to conceal them.
Buckle knives inflicted far more damage than a mundane knife, with enchantment bonuses ranging from +1 to +4.
