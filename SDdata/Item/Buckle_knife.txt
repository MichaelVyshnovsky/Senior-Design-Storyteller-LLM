'''''Buckle knives''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] concealed [[knives]] with a unique hilt.

==Description==
These knives were so named because their hilt resembled an ornament typically found on belt buckles. Because of this, buckles were also typically used like a sheath to conceal them.

==Powers==
''Buckle knives'' inflicted far more damage than a mundane knife, with enchantment bonuses ranging from ''+1'' to ''+4''.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Adele Astrolara]] owned a ''buckle knife'' in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She stored it in the ruins of [[Castle Naerytar]], in a chest alongside other magical trinkets, under the guard of a [[watchghost]] named [[Harold (watchghost)|Harold]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/72/Mistress on the Mere|67}}
