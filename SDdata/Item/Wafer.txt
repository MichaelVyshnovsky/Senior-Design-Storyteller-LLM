'''Wafers''' were thin and crisp types of usually sweet [[bread]], eaten by itself or constructed into elaborate dessert dishes.

==Usage==
Apart from gastronomical use, ''holy wafers'' were known to be used as an effective weapon against [[vampire]]s.{{Cite dungeon/72/Mistress on the Mere|59}} Some ''[[blessed]]'' wafers were known to ''[[cure disease]]'' and ''[[cure wounds]]''.

==Availability==
*In [[Arrabar]], a city-state in the [[Vilhon Reach]], wafers were a common accompaniment of noble ladies' afternoon [[tea]]. Thin wafers were topped with whipped [[honey]] and served along with fresh expensive imported teas.
*In [[Cormyr]], [[Suzail]]'s nobility, including kings, were served wafers smeared with liver pâté. A treat to some, torture to King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]].
*[[Elves]] of [[Elversult]] made wafers using [[acorn]]s. These fragile breads were served with white [[cheese]] and berry jelly.
*Delectable [[chocolate]] wafers were exported out of the land of [[Lopango]] in [[Maztica]] and could be found in many places across the world, including the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]].
