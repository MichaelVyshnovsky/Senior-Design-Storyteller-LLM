        "mainbody": "Wand of stinking cloud were magic wands that allowed the users to create pockets of nauseating stench.\nWands of stinking cloud were wooden rods, spotted with mold.\nThese wands allowed the wielder to cast the stinking cloud spell, creating a zone of nauseous vapors. On average, each wand had fifty charges and one use of the cloud exhausted three charges.\n1369 DR, several of these wands could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor with some found and wielded by the agents of the Cult of the Dragon.\nOne of the ways of creating a wand of stinking cloud was using a horn of an old green dragon.\nWands of stinking cloud were quite dangerous, costing lives of many adventurers over the years. It was believed they caused more accidental ally deaths than deaths of the wielders opponents, especially compared to all other enchanted items. Despite the danger, wands of stinking cloud remained in high demand."
