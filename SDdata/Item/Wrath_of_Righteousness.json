        "mainbody": "Wrath of Righteousness was a large heavy mace that was the weapon wielded by the avatar of Berronar Truesilver, the dwarven deity of traditional home life and safety.\nThis huge mace was made of steel and was inscribed with gold.\nThe +4 weapon was the bane of evil thieves and those involved in killing. Even if the mace just made contact with such a target, it would slay them outright, should they not be able to resist. Should the target have resisted the hit, Wrath of Righteousness would not be able to instantly kill the same being again."
