The '''''Heart'''''<ref group="note">The item's was called the ''Heart of...'' with the player's main character's name added to the item's description. This made the weapon uniquely named for every play through of ''[[Icewind Dale II]]''. was a mysterious [[enchanted]] [[longsword]] that bore the name of one of the heroes of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Heart'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that also granted the wielder protection from cold.

==History==
Nothing of the sword's past was known. However, sometime before [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, it came to be possessed by the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]]. The ''Heart'' ended up being available for purchase from [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in her trading company's store in [[Targos]] during the crisis of the [[Legion of the Chimera]], that brought mercenaries from [[Luskan]]to aid defenses of the [[Ten Towns]]. The leader of the group that would soon become famed heroes of Icewind Dale discovered the sword while perusing Gallaway Trade Depot. The weapon was several [[dwarf]] generations old and of distinct dwarven design and make. The blade bore the adventurer's name clearly etched onto it. Despite never encountering the weapon before, they felt a strange familiarity with it. It was not in the best shape, covered in signs of age and battle scars on the metal.
