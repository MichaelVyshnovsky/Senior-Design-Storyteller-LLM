Dust of illusion was a type of enchanted dust that could disguise a creature.
Unless stared at intently, this dust resembled powdered graphite or chalkdust. But when it was under scrutiny, dust of illusion would change color and form. It was contained in pouches, which usually contained around elven to twenty pinches.
Applying a pinch of dust of illusion to any creature allowed it to appear as any other creature of a similar shape, allowing for a size variance of around 50%. So for example, a human could appear as an ogre and a pegasus could appear as a mule.
While applying dust of illusion to a creature, the wielder had to envision the desired illusion. Unless dispelled, this illusionary effect would last for around seven to twelve hours.
Crystalmists could be used to make a high-quality dust of illusion.
