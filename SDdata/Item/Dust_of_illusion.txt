'''''Dust of illusion''''' was a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] dust that could disguise a creature.

==Description==
Unless stared at intently, this dust resembled powdered [[graphite]] or [[chalk]]dust. But when it was under scrutiny, ''dust of illusion'' would change color and form. It was contained in pouches, which usually contained around elven to twenty pinches.

==Powers==
Applying a pinch of ''dust of illusion'' to any creature allowed it to appear as any other creature of a similar shape, allowing for a size variance of around 50%. So for example, a [[human]] could appear as an [[ogre]] and a [[pegasus]] could appear as a [[mule]].

While applying ''dust of illusion'' to a creature, the wielder had to envision the desired illusion. Unless dispelled, this illusionary effect would last for around seven to twelve hours.

==Creation==
[[Crystalmist]]s could be used to make a high-quality ''dust of illusion''.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Halbasho]].
* [[Haroistem]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|561|Haroistem}}
* [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] was a notorious hoarder of magic devices and trinkets. He owned some ''dust of illusion'' and sometimes kept it on his person.
