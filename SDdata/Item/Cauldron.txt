Cauldrons, boilers, and kettles were common cooking vessels in the Realms, similar to pots.
These vessels were used to boil water and cook foods over a fire such as soups and stews. Kettles were smaller and often used for family meals, while cauldrons were much larger and able to cook for large groups. They could be cast or forged from iron, steel, or copper, and the most massive cauldrons could weigh as much as 40 tons. Spoons and ladles were vital for serving food from these vessels.
Cauldrons and kettles could also be used to pour substances such as boiling oil down castle walls onto invaders.
Auroras Emporium sold cauldrons with tripods, available as  for 10 gp,  for 22 gp, and  for 32 gp.
Magical cauldrons tended to have functions related to preparing potions, poisons, and extraordinary amounts of food.
