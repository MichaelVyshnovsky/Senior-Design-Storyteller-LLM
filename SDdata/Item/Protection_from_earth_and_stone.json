        "mainbody": "Protection from earth and stone was a magical scroll produced by the drow that was used to protect people from falling rocks.\nReading this scroll created a sphere  in diameter around the user for three to twelve minutes and moved with the caster. Falling rocks and earth that entered the sphere slowed to the rate of things under a feather fall spell and guaranteed a soft landing, rendering them harmless. In fact, the affected objects behaved as though there was no gravity and could be moved with very little force.\nA side effect of the sphere was that people within it fell as if they were under the effects of a feather fall spell, which allowed them to safely fall long distances. It did not hinder their normal movement and because objects that were not in touch with living creatures could not benefit from the feather fall effect, shooting or throwing objects functioned normally.\nProtection from earth and stone was a magical scroll that was uniquely found among the drow. Their clerics and wizards often created magical scrolls for their patrols. In the case of protection from earth and stone, the purpose was to provide a means to protect them from cave-ins."
