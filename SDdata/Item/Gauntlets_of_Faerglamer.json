        "mainbody": "'''''Gauntlets of Faerglamer''''' were [[enchanted]] gauntlets first created by [[Bilnur Faerglamer]].",
        "Description": "Depending on the form their wearer last commanded, the Gauntlets could be either lace-black-purple-\"glittershard\" elbow-length gauzy silk ladies' gloves, dirty, poorly wrapped bandages, or sleek and massive yet silent war-gauntlets in perfect condition.",
        "Powers": "Besides being able to shift between forms, ''gauntlets of Faerglamer'' were invariably supple enough for work of any delicacy, and made it impossible to drop objects by accident. So long as they were worn by a being of approximately human size, and worn on arms, they worked. They communicated all their powers to the wearer's mind: they automatically destroyed any of the ''Bigby's Hand'' spells at a touch, glow with ''[[faerie fire]]'' as willed, and cause up to a ton of anything to fall slowly, as per ''[[feather fall]]''. Any two of those powers could be active at once, regardless of other powers being active.\n\nAny left glove could reflect ''[[magic missile]]s'' back to their source, and every hour, the wearer could confer ''[[invisibility]]'' upon themselves or those they touched for up to 12 minutes. Once every 3 hours and 20 minutes, the left gauntlet could fire off a thrust that flew for {{SI|60|feet|long=yes}} at any target unerringly, dealing rather severe damage.\n\nRight gauntlets reflected instead ''[[lightning bolt]]'' and ''[[chain lightning]]'' spells back at their source; the wearer could use ''[[dimension door]]'' to move up to {{SI|300|yards|long=yes}} every 40 minutes, and fire off a ''forcethrust'' effect every three hours and twenty minutes. This effect was a {{SI|6|inches|c|long=yes}} wide and {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} long ruby ray that spoiled the spellcasting of any creature it touched, also dealing some damage. Its damage was doubled against any non-gaseous undead; all targets were immobilized for a minute due to the magic.\n\nGauntlets that were enchanted together, as a matched pair, granted additional powers when worn together, above and beyond those of the left and right gauntlet separately. Any creature touched with matched ''gauntlets'' could be affected as per ''[[hold monster]]'', lasting for four minutes; it would not work again on the same target until four hours had passed. They also granted ''[[water breathing]]'', allowed the user to employ ''[[locate object]]'' for up to 10 minutes every 12 days, a 2-hour ''[[passwall]]'' every 22 days, and a ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'' at 80% strength with a range of {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}} every 6 days.\n\nBeyond its base powers, only one such power could be active at a time.",
        "History": "[[Bilnur Faerglamer]] made hundreds of such gauntlets over his career and shipped them out through a merchant coster that served as a middleman, before becoming the [[Magister]]; after he became the Magister, he continued, but now hiding spell scrolls inside the gauntlets he crafted.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|59}} many pairs survived until the late 14{{th}} century, showing up in unexpected places.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Special matched pairs were rumored to have more powers that only awakened in very specific situations."
