        "mainbody": "Gauntlets of Faerglamer were enchanted gauntlets first created by Bilnur Faerglamer.\nDepending on the form their wearer last commanded, the Gauntlets could be either lace-black-purple-\"glittershard\" elbow-length gauzy silk ladies gloves, dirty, poorly wrapped bandages, or sleek and massive yet silent war-gauntlets in perfect condition.\nBesides being able to shift between forms, gauntlets of Faerglamer were invariably supple enough for work of any delicacy, and made it impossible to drop objects by accident. So long as they were worn by a being of approximately human size, and worn on arms, they worked. They communicated all their powers to the wearers mind they automatically destroyed any of the Bigbys Hand spells at a touch, glow with faerie fire as willed, and cause up to a ton of anything to fall slowly, as per feather fall. Any two of those powers could be active at once, regardless of other powers being active.\nAny left glove could reflect magic missiles back to their source, and every hour, the wearer could confer invisibility upon themselves or those they touched for up to 12 minutes. Once every 3 hours and 20 minutes, the left gauntlet could fire off a thrust that flew for  at any target unerringly, dealing rather severe damage.\nRight gauntlets reflected instead lightning bolt and chain lightning spells back at their source the wearer could use dimension door to move up to  every 40 minutes, and fire off a forcethrust effect every three hours and twenty minutes. This effect was a  wide and  long ruby ray that spoiled the spellcasting of any creature it touched, also dealing some damage. Its damage was doubled against any non-gaseous undead all targets were immobilized for a minute due to the magic.\nGauntlets that were enchanted together, as a matched pair, granted additional powers when worn together, above and beyond those of the left and right gauntlet separately. Any creature touched with matched gauntlets could be affected as per hold monster, lasting for four minutes it would not work again on the same target until four hours had passed. They also granted water breathing, allowed the user to employ locate object for up to 10 minutes every 12 days, a 2-hour passwall every 22 days, and a delayed blast fireball at 80% strength with a range of  every 6 days.\nBeyond its base powers, only one such power could be active at a time.\nBilnur Faerglamer made hundreds of such gauntlets over his career and shipped them out through a merchant coster that served as a middleman, before becoming the Magister after he became the Magister, he continued, but now hiding spell scrolls inside the gauntlets he crafted. many pairs survived until the late 14 century, showing up in unexpected places.\nSpecial matched pairs were rumored to have more powers that only awakened in very specific situations."
