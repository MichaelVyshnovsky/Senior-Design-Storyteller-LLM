        "mainbody": "'''''Wythyndle's Round Book''''' was one of the few [[holy book]]s of the [[Church of Milil]]. It described many [[spell]]s, including several ones exclusive to this book.",
        "Description": "The ''Round Book'' was shaped like a perfectly round disk, two thin slabs of unbreakable black stone encasing similarly round wire-rimmed [[vellum]] pages. The external sides of the stone were decorated with interwoven lattices of a gleaming, silvery metal.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Wythyndles-round-book.png|thumb|right|150px|''The Round Book surrounded by two Sorlyn priests.'']]\nWhen the tome was opened, brief [[:Category:Musical works|melodies]] rose from it. Those tunes were seemingly chosen at random, with the notable exception that these were never hymns to any [[deity|deities]].\n\nThe ''Round Book'' had the peculiar ability to stand upright without rolling or falling sideways despite winds, rain, or light nudges. Only a firm and deliberate action could topple it or move it elsewhere.\n\nAny direct attacks on the tome left it entirely unaffected, and damage was reflected to the attacker instead. This included magical attacks, as well as attempts to remove pages from the book, deface it, or destroy it.\n\nFinally, the book had the ability to teleport itself from place to place seemingly randomly, ignoring any magical or physical barriers and restraints. Some sages believed this ability to be intended spread the influence and worship of Milil. Amongst Sorlyn, the book was said to travel \"by the will of Milil\".",
        "Contents": "As a [[Spellbook]], the ''Round Book'' contained information on the following spells:\n:''[[accelerate healing]]'', ''[[analyze balance]]'', ''[[animate rock]]'', ''[[battle song]]'', ''[[blessed abundance]]'', ''[[calm chaos]]'', ''[[cloud of purification]]'', ''[[create holy symbol]]'', ''[[dispel silence]]'', ''[[dissension's feast]]'', ''[[divine inspiration]]'', ''[[draw upon holy might]]'', ''[[emotion control]]'', ''[[emotion read]]'', ''[[focus]]'', ''[[forgotten melody]]'', ''[[fortify]]'', ''[[genius]]'', ''[[heroes' feast]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[idea]]'', ''[[know customs]]'', ''[[memory read]]'', ''[[mind read]]'', ''[[music of the spheres]]'', ''[[mystic transfer]]'', ''[[nap]]'', ''[[personal reading]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', ''[[rapport]]'', ''[[sacred guardian]]'', ''[[singing stone]]'', ''[[speak with animals]]'', ''[[speak with dead]]'', ''[[speak with monsters]]'', ''[[speak with plants]]'', ''[[stone tell]]'', ''[[telepathy]]'', ''[[thought broadcast]]'', ''[[thought capture]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[unearthly choir]]'', and ''[[zone of truth]]''.\n\nIn addition and most significantly, the following spells were bestowed by Milil for the first time through this book: ''[[searing song]]'', ''[[song of healing]]'', and ''[[elsewhere chant]]''. Any faithful of a different deity that cast those spells would be compelled by a powerful ''[[geas]]'' spell to aid the next [[Sorlyn]] priest that would require their help. The most powerful members of the clergy were able to sense whenever someone was under the influence of that ''geas''.",
        "History": "The \"Book that Sings\" was bestowed by [[Milil]] to [[Wythyndle]], a blind [[half-elf]] [[bard]], during the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. Wythyndle was singing the deity's praises on a mountaintop of the eastern [[Cloven Mountains]] when he received the book, before being carried down to the [[House of Alastrin]] to bring news of this holy gift.",
        "Notable Owners": "The known owners of the ''Round Book'' are listed below in chronological order.\n* [[Wythyndle]], the first owner, to whom the book was originally entrusted.\n* The [[House of Alastrin]], a temple of Milil near Cloven Mountains. Lost the book in [[996 DR]], when Wythyndle died.\n* The [[Brossfeather]] noble house of [[Waterdeep]] (''circa'' [[1012 DR]])\n* The mage [[Artabranth]] of [[Eshpurta]] (''circa'' [[1018 DR]])\n* The red dragon [[Maerithryvvin]] (''circa'' [[1026 DR]])\n* The blue dragon [[Thoklastees]] of [[Calim Desert]]\n* The adventurer [[Flester Farcoat]] of the [[Dun Blades]] of [[Ulkan]] (''circa'' [[1144 DR]])\n* [[Annaethe Farcoat]] (briefly, in [[1161 DR]])\n* Lord [[Irlistir]] of Ulkan (''circa'' [[1161 DR]])\n* The bard [[Paerestus]] of [[Tsurlagol]] (until his death in [[1182 DR]])\n* The [[Church of Milil]], which took the book on a \"Grand Promenade\" around Sorlyn temples (from [[1296 DR]] to [[1313 DR]])\n* The adventurer [[Talandusar]] (''circa'' [[1337 DR]])\n* The mage [[Noustlas Mnarrath]] (''circa'' [[1345 DR]])\n* [[Obelos Braeril]], a merchant setting shop on the [[Way of the Dragon]] (''circa'' [[1355 DR]])\n* The Sorlyn priest [[Velmos Sonder]], who was the last known owner and kept the ''Round Book'' in the [[Abbey of Highsong]] until it was stolen."
