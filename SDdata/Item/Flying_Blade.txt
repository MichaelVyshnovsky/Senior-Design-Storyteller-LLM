The '''Flying Blade''' was one of the artifacts of [[The Nine]].

The spirit of [[Relve Langral]] was bound to the sword and could be called forth by the sword's owner and would unquestionably follow the owner's commands. His mind was twisted by [[Myrkul]] and he enjoyed killing. Relve's spirit was wreathed in blue flames when he was outside of the sword, which is why Relve is referred to as a [[blueflame ghost]]. The sword had been in the possession of the [[Stormserpent]] family of [[Suzail]] for many years. 

[[Elminster]] sought the sword and the other relics to feed to [[Simbul|Alassra Silverhand]] to restore her sanity.
