'''''Arvoreen's amulets of aid''''' were [[amulet]]s imbued with [[Arvoreen]]'s benevolent divine magics.

==Description==
These amulets were [[gold]]en disks {{SI|0'3|'"|long=yes}} in diameter with the ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Arvoreen the Defender inlaid in [[platinum]].

==Powers==
''Arvoreen's amulets of aid'' held six charges of the ''[[aid]]'' spell. While more powerful exemplars also could cast the ''[[dimension door]]'' spell. Usage of each spell expended certain number of charges, ''aid'' - one, while ''dimension door'' - three. Due to the divine nature of these necklaces, they could only be used by creatures who did not venerate evil. If an evil being attempted to wear one of these amulets, they suffered a wave of weakness as if covered in [[negative energy]]. This weakness could not be alleviated by any means apart from discarding the amulet. If the wearer of ''Arvoreen's amulets of aid'' ever attacked a goodly halfling, the necklace immodestly crumbled into dust.

==Creation==
''Arvoreen's amulets of aid'' could only be created by proficient hin wondrous item crafters. During the crafting process, the halfling needed to use ''aid'' and ''dimension door'' spells.

==History==
These goodly magical items gained popularity in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and could be found invidious cities across the [[Sword Coast]], not necessarily worn by [[halflings]].

In [[1372 DR]], one of these amulets belonged to a planar-traveling [[wizard]] and merchant of the magical trinkets named [[Vejoni H. Wyzz‎‎]] who pitched his pocket plane tent outside the town of [[Liam's Hold]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Daeghun Farlong]], an ex-adventurer and the father of [[Kalach-Cha]], the Knight-Commander of [[Crossroad Keep]].
