Boots of the Calming Wave were boots usable by monks and created by the ex-pirate Order of the Calming Wave.
Boots of the Calming Wave appeared as simple leather boots.
Boots of the Calming Wave were created to enhance monks defensive dodging abilities.
The Order of the Calming Wave was founded by a group of ex-pirates after they survived a particularly dangerous storm while in the sea. The pirate ships cleric claimed the storm was Umberlees wrath and only Valkur looked at them favorably. The survivors of the storm, by Valkurs blessing, decided to abandon their pirating ways and devoted themselves to the Captain of the Waves religion, promoting his will.
After the Wailing Death of 1372 DR, these boots could be found in places along the Sword Coast and islands of the Sea of Swords frequented by pirates and sailors.
