A '''starblade''' was a sword. To [[Kiril Duskmourn]]'s recollection, [[Nangulis]], a [[star elf]] from [[Sildëyuir]], wielded one. She considered such weapons to be more useful than daggers when confronted with incorporeal enemies, and on the same level as [[flame tongue]] swords: she also thought to get one at some point.{{cite book/Darkvision|136}}
