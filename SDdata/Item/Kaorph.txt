'''Kaorph''' was a type of fine [[wine]] that could be found throughout the [[Sword Coast]], made available by the [[Highmoon Trading Coster]]. The mercantile organization held exclusive rights to its import and sale.

==Description==
This wine had a somewhat unique hue, possessing a vivid, clear-blue color. Despite this almost tropical appearance, it didn't possess a fruity taste, rather a more floral flavor.
