The sword could sing any song known to Finder, in his own voice, whenever he will, even in battle. These tunes could hamper a foes morale, freeze shriekers, null the powers of harpies, and entrance beings with minds, making them open to suggestion.\nCategoryBastard swords\nCategoryPlus-7 items\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryMagic swords\nCategoryMagic weapons\nCategoryItems from Faer√ªn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nq8oro1ojbdj1lehqq3jt776vu9rb6z7"
