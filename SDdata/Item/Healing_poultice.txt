A healing poultice was an alchemical substance which promoted the healing of normal wounds.
When applied to wounds, the poultice doubled its normal rate of healing. Stronger versions tripled or even quadrupled it. The poultice was particularly useful for its lack of magical powers, which allowed it to work where healing potions could not.
The basic substance required only herbal lore to create, but the other versions required more advanced herbal lore and varying levels of alchemical skill to synthesize. Hedge wizards often traded in it. It sold for about 400 gold pieces, with a stronger version  800, and the strongest version for a thousand.
