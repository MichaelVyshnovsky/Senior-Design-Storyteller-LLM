'''''Silver bracers of Kedl''''' were polished [[silver]] [[enchanted]] [[bracers]] that once belonged to [[Kedl]] of the Three Rings, sometime before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
These [[silver]] arm guards possessed simple defensive ''+2'' enchantments.

==History==
These ''Silver Bracers'' were crafted and enchanted by Kedl, who resided in the town of [[Phlan]] in the [[Moonsea North]]. Known for perfecting the technique that allowed him to wear three enchanted [[ring]]s simultaneously, Kedl kept his polished bracers as a constant part of his fashionable outfit. Eventually, the man sold them to purchase more powerful magical rings. By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''Silver Bracers of Kedl'' found their way into the hands of a conniving [[drow]] merchant [[Nym (Icewind Dale)|Nym]], who traded rare enchanted items deep in the [[Dorn's Deep]] in the [[Spine of the World]].
