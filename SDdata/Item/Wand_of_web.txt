A '''''wand of web''''' was a [[magic]] [[wand]] that conjured a magical web capable of trapping and slowing down creatures in an area.

==Description==
Like most wands, a ''wand of web'' was about 15 in (38 cm) long.

==Powers==
The user of a ''wand of web'' could call upon the wand's power to cast the ''[[web]]'' spell up to seven times, after which the wand partially regained its power after successive dawns until fully recharged.

If the ''wand of web'' became depleted of its seventh charge, there was a small chance that it could crumble into ashes.

==Notable Owners==
The mercenary [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] carried a ''wand of web'' as part of his extensive collection of magic items.
