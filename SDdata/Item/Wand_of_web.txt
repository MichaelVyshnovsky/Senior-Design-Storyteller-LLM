A wand of web was a magic wand that conjured a magical web capable of trapping and slowing down creatures in an area.
Like most wands, a wand of web was about 15 in (38 cm) long.
The user of a wand of web could call upon the wands power to cast the web spell up to seven times, after which the wand partially regained its power after successive dawns until fully recharged.
If the wand of web became depleted of its seventh charge, there was a small chance that it could crumble into ashes.
The mercenary Jarlaxle Baenre carried a wand of web as part of his extensive collection of magic items.
