        "mainbody": "A magecloak was a type of enchanted item, often jewelry, worn by wealthy Cormyrean nobles.\nMagecloak rings, anklets, earrings, and even false beards were used to shield the wearer and those in the immediate vicinity from all forms of magical scrying.\nShortly before the , Jalassa Crownsilver of the old noble House Crownsilver, mother of Narantha Crownsilver of the Knights of Myth Drannor, acquired new magecloak earrings. She seemed unwilling to show the magic item to a fellow noble of Cormyr, Prester Yellander. Cormyrean nobles were convinced that even mighty Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, the Royal Magician, could not spy on them when magecloaks were active.\nMagecloak items were exported from the neighboring nation of Sembia to Cormyr and valued at a small fortune.\n*Blundebel Eldroon, a nobleman from Cormyr in the 14 century DR, wore a large jargoon ring on his fat hairy finger."
