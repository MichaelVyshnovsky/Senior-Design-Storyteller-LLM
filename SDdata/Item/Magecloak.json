        "Powers": "''Magecloak'' [[ring]]s, anklets, earrings, and even false beards were used to shield the wearer and those in the immediate vicinity from all forms of magical ''[[scrying]]''.",
        "History": "Shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, [[Jalassa Crownsilver]] of the old noble House [[Crownsilver]], mother of [[Narantha Crownsilver]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], acquired new ''magecloak earrings''. She seemed unwilling to show the [[magic item]] to a fellow noble of Cormyr, [[Prester Yellander]]. Cormyrean nobles were convinced that even mighty [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], the Royal Magician, could not spy on them when ''magecloaks'' were active.\n\n''Magecloak'' items were exported from the neighboring nation of [[Sembia]] to Cormyr and valued at a small fortune.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Blundebel Eldroon]], a nobleman from Cormyr in the 14{{th}} century DR, wore a large [[jargoon]] ring on his fat hairy finger."
