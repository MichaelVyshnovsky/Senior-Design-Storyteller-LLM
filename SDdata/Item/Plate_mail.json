        "mainbody": "'''Plate mail''' (also known '''field plate''' or simply '''plate''') was a type of armor used on [[Toril]].",
        "Description": "Plate mail consisted of shaped, interlocking plates. These plates covered the entire body. Beneath the metal was a thick layer of padding and numerous straps and harnesses to distribute the weight.\n\nMany of the pieces that made up a set of plate mail had their own distinct names, such as the [[couter]] (elbow guard), [[pauldron]] (shoulder guard), [[rerebrace]] (upper-arm guard), [[vambrace]] (forearm guard), and [[gorget]] (throat-plate).\n\nPlate was often the heaviest type of armor available, sacrificing mobility and agility for superior protection.",
        "Variations": "Plate mail was expensive and cumbersome. Variations of plate mail were available depending on the level of protection or manoeuvrability the wearer required.\n* '''[[Breastplate]]:''' Breastplate was a very minimal variation of plate mail. The breastplate covered your front and back. A light suit of [[studded leather]] was often worn underneath to protect the rest of the body.\n* '''[[Half-plate]]:''' This featured a number of key parts from a set of full plate, but not all. Half-plate was fitted over [[chainmail]] and hung more loosely than full plate.\n* '''Full plate:''' Also known as a \"coat-of-plate\",<ref> as the name suggested this referred to a complete set of plate mail. Full plate mail had to be built or adjusted to fit it's wearer. This could only be done by an armoursmith.\n* '''[[Heavy plate]]:''' This was a heavily reinforced suit of full plate. Heavy plate mail offered superior protection but weighed around 100 pounds. It was usually manufactured by races of exceptional strength. [[Orog]]s were known to manufacture heavy plate mail.",
