'''Barley loaf''' was a type of [[bread]] made using [[barley]] flour, a cheap alternative to wheat bread and a staple of peasant diet. It could be found in [[Neverwinter]] and in [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, a barley loaf was "served" to a rare sightâ€”a [[dwarf]] [[bard]] and artist. [[Morgalla the Mirthful]] was in the kitchens of [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s [[Blackstaff Tower]] when she ravaged a serving platter of [[roasted chicken]], [[cheese]], and a loaf of barley bread.
