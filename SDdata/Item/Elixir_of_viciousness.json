        "mainbody": "Elixirs of viciousness were magic potions that temporarily boosted the imbibers chances to land especially devastating hits.\nElixirs of viciousness were syrupy-thick concoctions that reminded those who looked into the liquid of predators lying in wait.\nWhen consumed, the potions improved the imbibers chances of landing particularly lucky and debilitating attacks. However, the effects of the potion were nullified if another long-lasting potion was consumed.\nA recipe of this elixir required alchemical vitriol of shadowroot sacs mixed together with certain types of ashes."
