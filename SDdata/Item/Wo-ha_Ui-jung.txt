The '''''Wo-ha Ui-jung''''' were ten magical chalices of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.

==Description==
Forged with arcane magic, each of the Wo-ha Ui-jung was carved to resemble a different beast. Each had a very different means of activation, needing to be filled with something, drunk from, or used as a lamp. Each had different powers, some great, some small, and some had unusual side-effects on their users.

==The Chalices==
* [[Coiled dragon (chalice)|''Coiled dragon'']]
* ''[[Dancing hart]]''
* ''[[Laughing hare]]''
* ''[[Leaping fish]]''
* ''[[Sitting bull]]''
* ''[[Sitting dog]]''
* ''[[Sitting monkey]]''
* ''[[Squatting toad]]''
* ''[[Standing bear]]''
* ''[[Standing deer]]''<ref group="note">The ''standing deer'' is also called "''standing monkey''", but since there is already a monkey, and the chalices are all of different animals, this is presumed to be a deer after all. ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV]]'', however, reprints this and calls it "''standing monkey''" twice.

==History==
The Wo-ha Ui-jung were created by the [[Han people]] some time before the 7th century before [[Dalereckoning]].The date is inferred from the last known date of the ''coiled dragon''.

The powers of the Wo-ha Ui-jung had all at one stage influenced the history of Koryo in some way. For example, the hero [[Niofu Sangto]] used the ''sitting dog'' to defeat the [[Kozakura]]n navy in the [[Battle of Wui Eyong]] and the [[shukenja]] [[Pitalla]] used the ''leaping fish'' to end the [[ivory plague]] in [[Mo'ki]]. In time, however, all became lost.

King [[Wanang Sun]] once led an expedition to recover three of them, and another was gifted to him by the grateful folk of [[Saishu]]. Around [[1357 DR]], he possessed the ''sitting bull'', ''sitting monkey'',  ''squatting toad'', and ''standing deer''.

==Legend==
According to legend, one who collected the Wo-ha Ui-jung all together once more would become the first emperor of the whole world.
