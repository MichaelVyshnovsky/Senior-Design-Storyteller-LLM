'''Fishhead soup''' was a simple type of soup found in [[Turmish]] and the city of [[Velen]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Availability==
*In Turmish, fishhead soup was a staple of humble households in the nation's coastal areas, alongside [[eel pie]]s, [[chive]]s and [[asparagus]] (locally better known as "greenspears" or "orsauda").
*Especially nauseating fishhead soup, as per [[Volothamp Geddarm]], was served alongside [[frybread]] and [[firecake]]s at [[The Figureheadless]] tavern in Velen.
