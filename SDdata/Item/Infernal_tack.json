        "mainbody": "nfernal tack was a set of magical equipment used exclusively by narzugon.\nInfernal tack was a set of special horse tack. It included a bit, bridle, reins, saddle, spurs, and stirrups.\nNarzugon used infernal tack on their nightmare steeds. Once equipped, the nightmare dutifully served their narzugon. This bond was forced on a nightmare, as they despised forced servitude. However, some nightmares were known to form a strong bond with their narzugon master. A narzugon summoned their mount by tapping the spurs together or passing them though blood. Infernal tack only summoned a nightmare who was already in service of the narzugon."
