'''''Staff spears''''' were [[enchanted]] [[staves]] that transformed into piercing weapons upon command.

==Powers==
''Staff spears'' appeared to be nothing but a mundane quarterstaff. Upon uttering a command word, these weapons manifested a sharp [[spear]] tip, turning it into a fully-functional [[polearm]]. These weapons radiated a slight aura of ''[[alteration]]'' magic and possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that improved the wielder's aim and damage output. Its transudation magic made ''staff spears'' easily wielded by anyone who knew how to handle a simple staff.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''staff spears'' were somewhat commonly found in the hands of inhabitants of several locales on [[Faer√ªn]]. [[Kirinhale]], a [[succubus]] prisoner of [[Durlag Trollkiller]] wielded a ''staff spear'' in the {{yearlink|1369}}. Another such weapon belonged to a [[Zhentarim]] agent and one-time companion of [[Abdel Adrian]] [[Xzar]], during his misadventures in the city of [[Athkatla]]. They could also be found among goods sold in both Athkatla and the town of [[Trademeet]].
