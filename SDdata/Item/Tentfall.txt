The tentfall was an experimental parachute conceived of by Nadul DaRoni while he developed other forms of powered flight.
In addition to the heartland flier, air screw, and doubles wheel, DaRoni put some effort into a device that would allow a common person to fall safely from a great height. According to his claims, any person with enough canvas could make it, in the form of a  square and  tall pyramidal tent-like shape.This size doesnt seem to match the diagrams of the device, which would depict 12 feet instead. The tricky part was apparently holding onto the large ring that hung from beneath the tentfall as it drifted downwards.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue listed the design by Nadul DaRoni, though it seemed to be a non-saleable item, instead intended to instruct others in the creation of their own tentfalls.
