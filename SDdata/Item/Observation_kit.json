Using such kits also greatly improved their skills in thievery and boosted their perception.\nSuch observation kits were used by thieves who worked for the bandit leader named Desram who operated in the Sword Mountains in the 15 century DR. Orc raiders of the Ash Ridge were known to carry these sets, as well as undead servants of the vampire lord Ozit who laired in the ruins of Illefarn."
