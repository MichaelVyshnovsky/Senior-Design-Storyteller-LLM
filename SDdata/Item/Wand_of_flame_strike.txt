Wands of flame strike were magic wands, usable by clerics, paladins, and rangers, allowing the wielder to harness the deadly divine flames.
Wands of flame strike were slender birch rods with scorch marks.
These wands allowed the wielder to cast the flame strike spell. Each wand held at least one charge.
In 1369 DR, several sands of flame strike could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor during the ruins occupation by the Cult of the Dragon. Some of the high-ranking members of the Cult, stationed in Castle Cormanthor carried there wands. Another wand could be recovered from the laboratory of a mad lich, Thyaast Ammath, in the deepest parts of the Elven Catacombs, by the chasm that led into the Underdark.
