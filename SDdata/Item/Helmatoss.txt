Helmatoss was a type of ale, or "small beer," named after the certain long-dead tavernkeeper named Alanra Helmatoss, who lived some years before the late 15 century DR.
Helmatoss was a heavy, sweet, oily, and clear pale ale. Because of its heft and acquired taste, many speculated that the ales name did not derive from Alanra Helmatoss but from the vomiting it caused in those who over-indulged.
Harpers discovered that Helmatoss was a beverage with some curative properties. It could neutralize many poisons and reduce rumbling stomachs acidity. The beverage was also highly flammable.
Helmatoss was popular among merchants and traders and was found commonly on the Sword Coast, all along the Trade Way, as far north as the city of Luskan.
