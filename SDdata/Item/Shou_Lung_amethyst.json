        "mainbody": "Shou Lung amethyst was a corundum mineral more similar to ruby and sapphire than to the amethysts found in Faer√ªn. Kara-Tur was believed to be the source for these gem stones, where their properties were said to protect the nobility.\nThe deep purple amethyst-like hue gave Shou Lung amethyst its name.\nThese stones were rumored to have strong magical powers, but none have been documented.\nThe Shou Lung amethysts, or oriental amethysts, were considered prized gems among the drow and were their favorites. So much so that the majority of their city had the know-how to competently work them."
