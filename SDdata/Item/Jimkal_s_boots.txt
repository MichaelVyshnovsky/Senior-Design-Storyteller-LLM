'''''Jimkal's boots''''' was a pair of [[enchanted]] [[boot]] thought to be related to a tale of [[Jimkal]], a [[mage]] of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Powers==
''Jimkal's boots'' granted the wearer ability to dash at a supernatural speed for short periods of time. Additionally, the wearer became slightly more vulnerable to all types of [[poison]]s.

==History==
It remained unknown if ''Jimkal's boots'' belonged to the fabled [[drow]] wizard Jimkal or inspired by his tale. Sometime long before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Jimkal's House fell victim to Menzoberranzan's cruel politics, forcing the male to go into exile, stripped of all his possessions. Before he fled, Jimkal begged one of the ruling Matron Mothers to allow him a simple pair of boots to ease the journey. The Matron Mother granted him the wish but not before transforming the pitiful male into a [[drider]], damned to hunting in the darkness of the [[Underdark]] for the rest of his abominable life. The punchline of the story was the fact that with two of the so-called ''Jimkal's boots'', the drider still had six other legs unclothed.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Jimkal's boots'' were in possession of a drow merchant who did business in the [[Undergate]], [[Westgate]]'s the unsavory underbelly.
