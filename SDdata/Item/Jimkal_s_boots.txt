Jimkals boots was a pair of enchanted boot thought to be related to a tale of Jimkal, a mage of Menzoberranzan.
Jimkals boots granted the wearer ability to dash at a supernatural speed for short periods of time. Additionally, the wearer became slightly more vulnerable to all types of poisons.
It remained unknown if Jimkals boots belonged to the fabled drow wizard Jimkal or inspired by his tale. Sometime long before the late 14 century DR, Jimkals House fell victim to Menzoberranzans cruel politics, forcing the male to go into exile, stripped of all his possessions. Before he fled, Jimkal begged one of the ruling Matron Mothers to allow him a simple pair of boots to ease the journey. The Matron Mother granted him the wish but not before transforming the pitiful male into a drider, damned to hunting in the darkness of the Underdark for the rest of his abominable life. The punchline of the story was the fact that with two of the so-called Jimkals boots, the drider still had six other legs unclothed.
As of the , Jimkals boots were in possession of a drow merchant who did business in the Undergate, Westgates the unsavory underbelly.
