'''''Blades of forgetfulness''''' were magical weapons that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. These special weapons were only used by [[Holy slayer]]s.

==Description==
These blades were available in sizes ranging from [[jambiya]]s to [[scimitar]]s.

==Powers==
''Blades of forgetfulness'' did not grant their wielder any additional fighting prowess. A wielder who waved the blade in a figure eight pattern could make anyone viewing the display lose their memories from the past few minutes before the display to the next few minutes after the display. These weapons were especially handy when bypassing guards while on an assassination mission.
