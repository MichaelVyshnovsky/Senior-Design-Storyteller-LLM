        "mainbody": "sionic seals were pieces of psionic circuitry that were placed onto inanimate objects, portable objects and even living creatures. Making one required access to the discipline imprint psionic circuitry and any object that was not designed for it. Psi-sensitive individuals were able to detect the seals.\nIllithids could essentially tattoo a psionic seal onto their body. Seals used in this manner were often beneficial, and copied psionic abilities the illithid could use, but the seal when used did not use any of the illithids psionic energy. The power imprinted into the seal could be used once per day. An illithid could only get three seals onto itself before the danger of causing a short circuit became too much. Below are some examples of powers an individual could imprint on a seal\n* It could have the power to heal every 24 hours.\n* It could grant immunity to one attack every 24 hours\n* It allowed illithids to transfer psionic energy between each other, as long as they both possessed a seal.\n* It could reflect 1 spell every week\n* It could grant immunity to normal fire\n* It could cause a haste effect for one third of a minute every 24 hours.\n* It could pierce through a single illusion every 24 hours.\n* It could open most normal locks.\n* It could make the user completely resist a poison once per week.\n* Wearer could get the ability  to detect undead for 360 feet (110 meters) around itself once every 24 hours."
