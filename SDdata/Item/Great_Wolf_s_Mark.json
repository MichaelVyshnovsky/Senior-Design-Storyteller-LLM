It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nSilverhand awarded this piece of headgear to Raika to aid in her mission to inspire other warriors toward victory in the midst of battle.\nWhile wearing this helmet, Raikas taunts and battle cries energized and inspired her allies, and in some cases, could bestow speed reminiscent of the haste spell onto one of her allies.\n* Raika, a half-orc barbarian for whom Silverhand also crafted the Great Wolfs Fury, the maul of focused destruction, and the seal of harmony."
