        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of fortitude''''' was a type of [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[ring]] that enhanced the wearer's fortitude, making them appear fearless in the face of adversity and danger.",
        "Effects": "These rings served as a magical enchanter of the user's fortitude and improved their chances of withstanding such effects as ''[[fear]]''.",
        "History": "''Rings of fortitude'' were originally created by [[Bedine]] [[shaman]]s of [[Anauroch]]. These rings were given to the strongest warriors as a boon, proving their strength in raids on other Bedine tribes and against alien forces. The weaker ''rings of fortitude'' were pretty common, and the rigs of stronger enchantments were reserved for the tribes' leaders."
