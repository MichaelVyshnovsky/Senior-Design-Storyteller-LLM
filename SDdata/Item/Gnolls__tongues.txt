'''Gnolls' tongues''' was a [[pepper]]ed delicacy dish from the [[Red Wizards]]' nation of [[Thay]].

==Description==
[[Gnoll]]s' tongues were cooked, peppered, and served encased in molded gelatinous aspic. In [[Priador]]'s capital â€“ [[Bezantur]], gnolls' tongues in aspic was served as a main dish, accompanied by [[jellied egg]]s and [[pickled rice]]. The dish was served in a mound on a plate and had to be eaten quickly before it melted and lost its shape.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Aznar Thrul]], the [[Zulkir of Evocation]] and the [[Tharchion]] of Priador considered peppered gnolls' tongues to be a favorite but not worth eating once warm and shapeless.
