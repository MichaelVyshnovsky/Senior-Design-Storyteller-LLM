        "mainbody": "Boakhar was the Realms name for wulfenite, a semi-precious stone that was used as an inlay on antique furniture from Sembia and Calimshan.\nBoakhar was extremely soft and its flat, rectangular crystals broke easily, but its vibrant red and orange hue was alluring and lapidarists made small, sparkling, faceted gems that could be used in places that didnt experience much handling. The crystals and gems were often used for inlays on furniture and royal displays. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.\nBoakhar gems were highly sensitive to magic missiles and would emit jets of flame whenever the spell was cast within ten feet (three meters) of them. This also occurred if a magic missile passed within the same radius. The jets were seven feet (2.1 meters) long and burned for a full minute, consuming the gemstones in the process. The furniture or other material that the gems were mounted on were not touched by the fire, but the flames were hot enough to ignite combustible materials and damage creatures."
