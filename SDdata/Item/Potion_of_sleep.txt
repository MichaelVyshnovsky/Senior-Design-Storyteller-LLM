A '''''potion of sleep''''', also known as '''potion of somnolence''', was a powerful [[potion]] that put the imbiber to deep sleep and was extremely dangerous in its undiluted form.

==Description==
The hazy liquid of the potion was swirled with hypnotic patterns. The concentrated liquid that composed a ''potion of somnolence'' created a puff of white mist when the vial was uncorked. It strongly smelled and tasted like [[blackberry|blackberries]]. Drinking the potion made one's mouth tingle as if biting into a mint leaf.

==Origins==
One of the types of ''potion of somnolence'' was distilled out of dark purple mushroom caps, each the size of a dinner plate. These peculiar mushrooms were found in the [[Feywild]] all around [[Darroch Castle]], growing in sporadic clusters.

Blood of a [[werejackal]] was an ingredient of another recipe for the ''potion of sleep''. It could be a telltale sign as the blood tended to  flake in the potion's liquid. And some were known to use locks of [[nymph]] hair as an ingredient.<ref>{{Cite dragon/240/Ecology of The Nymph|72}}

==Powers==
Undiluted, ''potion of somnolence'' was an incredibly powerful and addictive substance. Just one sip of the highly watered down soporific liquid (one drop of the potion in a vial-full of drinking water) was enough to send the user to sleep in less time than it took to count down from ten. A typical dosage was just one mouthful and it was enough to last several hours.

==History==
Around [[1396 DR]], [[Japheth Donard]] used a dangerously concentrated ''potion of somnolence'' to create a sleeping-aid-like elixir to help [[Anusha Marhana]], a young [[Spellscar|spell-scarred]] [[human]] noble, to access her unusual power of projecting a ghost-like astral form in times of danger. The ability was only triggered during sleep.<ref>
