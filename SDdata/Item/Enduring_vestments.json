        "Powers": "''Enduring vestments'' possessed a simple ''+1'' protective enchantment and granted the wearer resistance to [[spell]]s. Additionally, the wearer could cast the ''[[false life]]'' spell once per day.",
        "History": "Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the first set of ''enduring vestments'' were created by a wizard of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] named [[Nimreth Aragodar]] after almost losing her life at the claws of one of the creatures the wizard experimented on. Even though the created mage's garb protected her from spells and physical harm, it did not save Nimreth when a summoned [[water elemental]] filled her lungs with water.\n\nIn 1374 DR, a  robe of ''enduring vestments'' was worn by an appraise of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] who operated out of the Brotherhood's spy outpost north of [[Neverwinter]]."
