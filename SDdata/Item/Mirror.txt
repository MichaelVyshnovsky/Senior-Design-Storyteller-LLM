A '''mirror''' was an object that reflected an image, as long as a light source was present.

==Description==
[[File:Torleth Mindulspeer.png|thumb|250px|A collection of objects, including a handheld mirror.]]
In general, the surfaces of mirrors were made of [[glass]], which was sometimes [[silver]]ed. This meant their surfaces were rather brittle, and could be easily smashed. The frames of mirrors were usually made of silver or [[steel]], with the latter being far harder. Some mirrors around the Realms were easily transportable, and such mirrors were known as [[hand mirror]]s.

Though many mirrors were mundane, there were also several [[magic]]al ones throughout the Realms. Some magical mirrors could sell for 1,000s of [[gold]] pieces.

Mirrors could be used to reflect powerful rays back at enemies. This was particularly the case for [[medusae]], as mirrors could reflect their [[petrification|petrifying]] gaze back at them, turning them to stone. Some mirrors could be used to scry on others. 

It was possible to access a mysterious plane, the [[Plane of Mirrors]], via a mirror. In this plane were several sets of mirrors that led to many different places.

A whole mirror or a small piece of one was used as a [[material component]] for a variety of [[spell]]s in the Realms. These included ''[[dark mirror]]'', ''[[detect scrying]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'',<ref> ''[[flesh mirage]]'',<ref> ''[[physical mirror]]'', and ''[[spell mirror]]''. Older versions of ''[[sanctuary]]'' and [[scrying (spell)|''scrying'']] required a small silver mirror to cast, as did ''[[improved sanctuary]]''.<ref> Additionally, a piece of a broken mirror was needed to cast ''[[Bane of Beshaba]]'' and crushed glass from one was needed to cast ''[[damage mirror]]''.

Spells unique to the land of [[Kara-Tur]] that required a mirror to cast included ''[[remember]]'' and ''[[fire enchantment]]''.<ref>

==History==
Mirrors had been used throughout the history of [[Faer√ªn]]. Glass mirrors dated as far back as the time of [[Netheril]], where they first became available in {{YearlinkConvert|1985|NY}}.

Some regions, such as the [[Land of the Lions]], even produced mirrors and exported them to others towns and cities across the land.

==Reputation==
Many faiths across [[Toril]] used mirrors to represent their deities. An aspect of [[Shekinester]], the Empowerer, was represented by a mirror. The [[Spirit of the Sun]] of [[Kara-Tur]] was said to grant his followers, such as [[Matasuuri Shogoro]], gifts, which included mirrors.

Large [[mirror]]s were outlawed in [[Turmish]] due to the fear of [[fetch]], predatory creatures of the [[Abyss]] who used mirrors as portals to the [[Prime Material plane]]. An unsettling Turmite folk song about fetch was a popular explanation of the strange mirror-banning law.

==Notable Owners of Mirrors==
===Individuals===
* [[Llewellyn (proxy)|Llewellyn]], a [[proxy]] of the goddess [[Hanali Celanil]], had the power to turn any smooth surface into one of the many varieties of enchanted mirrors that existed throughout the [[multiverse]]. Such as a ''mirror of life trapping'', ''mirror of mental prowess'', and ''mirror of opposition''.<ref>
* In {{YearlinkConvert|1663|WY}}, [[Matasuuri Shogoro]] was gifted by the [[Spirit of the Sun]] a shining mirror, [[pearl]], and sword in recognition of his efforts to unify the land of [[Wa]]. When he later became [[shogun]], Shogoro decided the objects were bad luck and had them all given away. A century later in [[1357 DR]], the Spirit of the Sun visited and was offended to learn the objects were gone, leading to a [[tairo]] to instruct some adventurers to retrieve the objects. They tracked down the shining mirror to the businessman [[Oshiro Yoto]], but it had been stolen by [[Korai Anteki]].<ref>
* [[Purfbin Doogrick]] was a [[gnome]] adventurer who had pockets full of useful junk at all times. A broken mirror was one of those items and it even saved his hide once.
* [[Torleth Mindulspeer]] owned a unique [[Calishite]] mirror with an enchanted image of a [[snake]] in [[grass]].

===Religions===
* One of the [[Church of Leira]]'s most holy rituals, the [[Unmasking]], required mirrors to be present.<ref>
* The [[Church of Lliira]]'s opulent temples often had artfully gilt mirrors.<ref>
* The [[Church of Sune]]'s clergy sometimes offered their personal prayers to their goddess while looking into a mirror lit only by natural or [[candle]] light. [[Sune]] in turn would use mirrors to send visions to those seeking guidance in life by altering her worshiper's reflection.<ref>

==Rumors & Legends==
Breaking a mirror was seen as a bad omen around the entire universe.<ref name=dd-p10">
