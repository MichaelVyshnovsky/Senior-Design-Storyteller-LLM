The seal of righteousness was a unique enchanted trinket crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Nayeli Goldflower in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
The seal of righteousness was a precious medallion inlaid with unusually sharp gemstones, which required Nayeli to handle it with care and respect. According to Silverhand, this was intended to draw a parallel with how Nayeli had to pay similarly close attention to her behavior and oath as a paladin.
While the seal of righteousness was in her possession, Nayeli had good fortune in combat.
* Nayeli Goldflower, a paladin of Tyr to whom Silverhand also gifted the halberd of swift admonition.
