Internal combustion engine were a type of massive, experimental machinery. They could only be found in the innermost rooms of major Gond temples, off limits to all but the high-ranking clergy of the church.These engines were specifically noted as resembling what we would call "rotative beam engines."
These machines required oil to function and were liable to experience explosions.
