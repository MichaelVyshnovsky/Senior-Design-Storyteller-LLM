'''''Myrkulite scourges''''' were [[enchanted]] [[flail]]s wielded by the Mistresses of Souls of the [[Church of Myrkul]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Myrkulite scourges'' were flails made of bone with their heads fashioned out of spiked skulls. Flesh, tissue, and brain matter was known to get stuck on the weapons' spikes.

==Powers==
Each of the flails was enhanced with a simple ''+1'' enchantment that increased the weapon's damage and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, each successful attack dealt [[necrotic]] damage.

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, several notable Mistresses of Souls carried such weapons. The Church of Myrkul was allied with the Absolute, lending it necromancers and evil [[clerics]]. Those who wielded ''Myrkulite scourges'' in the [[Moonrise Towers]] at the ruins of [[Reithwin]] included [[Radija]], [[Susdera]], [[Sarabayle]], [[Willinx Jindlebee]], [[Duckie Verish]], and [[Kressa Bonedaughter]], who performed dark magics on the [[Bhaalspawn]] knows as the [[Dark Urge]].
