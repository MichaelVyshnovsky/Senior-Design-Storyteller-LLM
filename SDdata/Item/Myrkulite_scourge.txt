Myrkulite scourges were enchanted flails wielded by the Mistresses of Souls of the Church of Myrkul in the late 15 century DR.
Myrkulite scourges were flails made of bone with their heads fashioned out of spiked skulls. Flesh, tissue, and brain matter was known to get stuck on the weapons spikes.
Each of the flails was enhanced with a simple +1 enchantment that increased the weapons damage and guided the wielders hand towards the target. Additionally, each successful attack dealt necrotic damage.
During the Absolute crisis of the , several notable Mistresses of Souls carried such weapons. The Church of Myrkul was allied with the Absolute, lending it necromancers and evil clerics. Those who wielded Myrkulite scourges in the Moonrise Towers at the ruins of Reithwin included Radija, Susdera, Sarabayle, Willinx Jindlebee, Duckie Verish, and Kressa Bonedaughter, who performed dark magics on the Bhaalspawn knows as the Dark Urge.
