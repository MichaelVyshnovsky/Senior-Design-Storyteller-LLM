'''Twinkledust''' was a type of fireworks, on par with [[firecracker]]s, made using [[smokepowder]] in the [[Blade Kingdoms]].

==History==
Twinkledust was considered harmless and childish toy by military men of the Blade Kingdoms. In [[1217 DR]], when [[Lomatra]]n Blade Captain advocated for the use of [[arquebus]]es and smokepowder for warfare, Blade Captain [[Orlando Toporello]] angrily compared it to playing with firecrackers and twinkledust as opposed to soldering with honest swords and more traditional arms.
