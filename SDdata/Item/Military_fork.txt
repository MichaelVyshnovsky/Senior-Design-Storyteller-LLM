'''Military forks''' were a type of [[polearm]] developed from [[pitchfork]]s.

==Description==
Military forks were similar in appearance to pitchforks, but had longer shafts that measured {{SI|7|ft|adj=tall}}. stronger and straighter than pitchforks. Some had a third tine mounted just below these spikes, in the crotch of the fork.

==Weaponology==
Military forks were primarily thrusting weapons, efficient at holding enemies at bay, though they lacked the major penetrating power of spears with respect to heavily armored foes. The third tine some were forks were fitted with in the crotch prevented opponents from safely going between the two main piercers and allowed wielders to pull horsemen off their [[mount]]s. They required two hands to wield.<ref>{{Cite dragon/127/Two Hands Are Better Than One|34}}

Non-combat uses for military forks fitted with the third tine included hoisting baskets of supplies, climbing ramparts, and setting up ladders.
