'''Sunrods''' were a light source created either through alchemy<ref> or [[magic]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1456}}

==Description==
Sunrods were [[iron]] rods with golden tips, measuring roughly {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length and weighing {{SI|1|lbs.|k|long=yes}}. They were activated by striking them against another surface.

They casted a steadier light than torch light,&mdash;typically four to six hours&mdash;and they were difficult to extinguish. Once a sunrod's duration was over, its golden tip became dim and unusable.

==Creation==
[[Ember moss]] was one of the few known items that could be used in the creation of sunrods.<ref>

==Availability==
* [[Almaes the Alchemist's shop]] in [[Ashabenford]] sold sunrods.
* [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]] in [[Red Larch]], being a business run by an alchemist, sold sunrods.{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|84}}

==Usage==
* Some miners were known to attach sunrods to [[helmet]]s in order to provide them a hands-free source of illumination.
* Sunrod chemicals could be incorporated into [[arrow]]s, [[bolt]]s, or [[bullet|sling bullets]] to craft what was known as [[signal ammunition]].
* Both [[gold dwarves]] and [[shield dwarves]] were commonly seen to carry sunrods.<ref>

==Notable Users==
* [[Jak Fleet]]<ref>
