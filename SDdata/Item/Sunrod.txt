Sunrods were a light source created either through alchemy or magic.
Sunrods were iron rods with golden tips, measuring roughly  in length and weighing . They were activated by striking them against another surface.
They casted a steadier light than torch light,&mdashtypically four to six hours&mdashand they were difficult to extinguish. Once a sunrods duration was over, its golden tip became dim and unusable.
Ember moss was one of the few known items that could be used in the creation of sunrods.
* Almaes the Alchemists shop in Ashabenford sold sunrods.
* Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch, being a business run by an alchemist, sold sunrods.
* Some miners were known to attach sunrods to helmets in order to provide them a hands-free source of illumination.
* Sunrod chemicals could be incorporated into arrows, bolts, or sling bullets to craft what was known as signal ammunition.
* Both gold dwarves and shield dwarves were commonly seen to carry sunrods.
