A '''branding iron''', or '''brand''', was a device used to scorch an identifying mark into a material or the skin of a living creature.
{{Quote
|In a time of prosperity like this one, when a man may well have two [[ass]]es and ten [[ox]]en, a branding iron is a welcome tool.

==Description==
A brand was basically a long metal rod designed to be repeatedly heated and cooled with use. If intended to impart a specific design such as a symbol or letter of script, the head of it would have an elaborate shape that was pressed into the surface material.

==Availability==
[[File:Branding iron Aurora.png|thumb|''Aurora's set of brands.'']]
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered branding irons that marked each and every character of the [[Dethek]], [[Thorass]], and [[Espruar]] scripts for 8 [[gp]], as well as custom-built sigils for 13 gp.

==Usage==
The most common use of branding was the marking of livestock and other animals with their owner's mark, making it harder to rustle and sell on the stolen animals thanks to the original owner's identity being plain.

Groups such as the [[Ashmadai]] and the cult of [[the Absolute]] branded their initiates with their god's symbol to ensure their loyalty, potentially marking the soul itself with their master's sigil.

Brands were also used as a means of indelibly marking a prisoner, criminal, or [[slave]], usually in a highly visible part of the body.{{Cite dragon/334/Crimmor: City of Caravans|33}} Branding irons could also be used as tools of torture, by the simple expedient of burning the victim's flesh.

A brand could be used as a bludgeoning weapon in a pinch, as it was still ultimately a large and solid piece of metalwork. If the brand was glowing hot at the time, the damage inflicted was much increased.

==Magic==
* A symbol could be created on a surface by the ''[[arcane mark]]'' spell, which was painless and temporary.
* A painful mark could be created by the ''[[brand]]'' spell, which burned a short set of script into a living or nonliving surface, and could not be removed or healed by most means.{{Cite dragon/268/Secrets of the Brotherhood of the True Flame}}
