'''Almond cakes''' were a type of sweet baked handfood found in the [[Western Heartlands]], the [[Sword Coast]], and [[Northwest Faer√ªn]].

==Availability==
Almond cakes were baked in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. One of the bakeries that specialized in this sweet treat was [[Ackrieg's Bakery]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

The pastry was consumed as far south as [[Calimshan]] and as far east as [[Thymar]], [[Tymanther]].

==History==
In the late {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette'' could have published a recipe for the "Almond Cakes of [[Avernus]]", the courtesy of a new cafe opened by some of the surviving [[Elturian]] refugees, six months after the [[Absolute crisis]]' resolution.
