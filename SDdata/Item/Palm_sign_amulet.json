They were gifted to their ancestors by Martek as part of his prophecy to defeat Khalitharius, they were meant to release Aeraldoth.\nWhen put over the palm of a woman who bore the palm mark, the amulet would reveal a message.\nIn the presence of Khalitharius, the amulet would rebuke him with a beam of cold, blue light. Otherwise, the amulet might have acted as a ring of fire resistance until Aeraldoth was released.\nAfter sealing Khalitharius, Martek gave the amulets to the leader of the Durpari in the area of the Oasis of the White Palm. They became badges of office passed down the generations. By the , their true purpose had been largely forgotten.\nIn that year, an amulet may have been used to drive away Khalitharius after his kidnapping of princess Shadalah. By putting it against her palm, however, the way to release Aeraldoth was revealed.\n* Hassan Arslan\n* Kassim Arslan"
