        "Powers": "In the presence of Khalitharius, the amulet would rebuke him with a beam of cold, blue light.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|84}} Otherwise, the amulet might have acted as a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'' until Aeraldoth was released.",
        "History": "After sealing Khalitharius, Martek gave the ''amulets'' to the leader of the [[Durpari]] in the area of the Oasis of the White Palm.

By the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, their true purpose had been largely forgotten.\n\nIn that year, an amulet may have been used to drive away Khalitharius after his kidnapping of princess [[Shadalah]]. By putting it against her palm, however, the way to release Aeraldoth was revealed.",
