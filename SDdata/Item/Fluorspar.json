        "mainbody": "'''Fluorspar''', also called '''[[wikipedia:en:fluorite|fluorite]]''', was a soft, easily workable stone found in many colors. The pink and red varieties were sometimes called '''cabra stones'''.",
        "Description": "These [[ornamental stones]] cleaved easily to form faceted gemstones, but this treatment was reserved for small samples and specimens of the most popular colors: pale blue, green, yellow, purple, pink, and red. A purple-and-white banded variety known as [[Archon (hardstone)|archon]] or Blue John was mined in large blocks and used for carving. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp, with the higher valued stones tended to be the red and pink varieties.",
        "Location": "Purple fluorite was commonly found in the [[Underdark]], in places of extreme darkness.",
        "Uses": "Only larger specimens of fluorite were suitable for extracting from the depths of earth.",
        "Powers": "All varieties of fluorspar gave off a faint green glow when ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'' creatures or objects were within {{SI|20|ft}}. Fluorspar did not react to [[Ethereal plane|ethereal]] objects or creatures, nor to things or beings merely disguised."
