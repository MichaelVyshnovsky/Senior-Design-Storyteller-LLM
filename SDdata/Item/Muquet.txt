'''Muquet''' was an alcoholic concoction known as a cordial in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}

==Description==
Cordials in Khôltar, at least the ones available from [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]] (on the [[North Way]] just south of Handrornlar, the north gate out of the Iron City), were a mixture of a fiery wine, fruit juice, and a dash of secret [[herb]]s. Muquet used the juice, pulp and rind of a fruit similar to a small [[orange]]. This cordial was the color of [[amber]] and was touted as having medicinal uses by the staff at Munsrum's. A bottle of muquet sold for 3 [[gold piece]]s.
