        "mainbody": "'''''Dust of tracelessness''''' was an [[enchanted]] powder that covered up the tracks of its user and other nearby creatures.",
        "Description": "This power was typically found within finely sewn [[pouch]]es, each containing around 13 to 24 pinches-worth of the substance.",
        "Powers": "When a pinch of this powder was into the air within an interior space, it caused a floor space of up to {{SI|1000|sq ft|long=yes}} to take on an appearance of decades of disuse, becoming dusty, dirty, laden in cobwebs. When used in an outdoor space, such as being sprinkled along a trail, a pinch of this powder would cause all evidence of the user and up to a dozen other [[human]]-sized individuals and [[horse]]s to be\nerased for as far back as a {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}}. Regardless of where it was used, this powder did not produce any [[dweomer]].\n\nLater iterations of this power in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] were comparatively less potent, only affecting a chamber space of up to {{SI|100|sq ft|long=yes}} and only removing outdoor trails as far back as {{SI|250|ft|long=yes}} into the distance. However, these later iterations continued to leave no lingering aura after use.",
        "Creation": "Creating some ''dust of tracelessness'' required use of the [[spell]] ''[[pass without trace]]''.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Jannaxil Serpentil]], a bookseller in [[Waterdeep]], owned a pouch of ''dust of tracelessness'' that he either carried on his person or kept close at hand within his office.<ref>\n* [[Rornar Gordrinn]], a [[shield dwarf]] in the [[Silver Marches]] dedicated to slaying [[orc]]s, owned a pouch of ''dust of tracelessness''.<ref>{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Rornar Gordrinn}}\n* [[Sigird Sigirdson]], a [[thief]] in the [[the Vast]], owned a pouch of ''dust of tracelessness.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|18}}\n* [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]], a member of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] who was a notorious hoarder of magic devices and trinkets, owned a pouch of ''dust of tracelessness'' and sometimes kept it on his person."
