Turmishite apple and bloodberry pie was a sweet baked dish from Turmish in the 14 century DR.
It was made from, of course, apple and bloodberry. It was similar to a cherry pie, but much more tart.The bloodberry bush is found around the Battle of Bones and is extremely poisonous in every part. Its unknown if the bloodberries used in the pie are the same poisonous bloodberries used in minute amounts or a unique cooking method to eliminate or reduce the poison, are a different plant species entirely, or if only Battle of Bones bloodberries are poisonous. More likely, the bloodberries could be mistaken for goblinberries, which are similar, also found around the Battle of Bones, and can be consumed in a sweet dish.
While few loved it, Vhonna Deepdell and Madame Garah of Waterdeep did and bonded over Turmishite apple and bloodberry pies around 1368 DR.
