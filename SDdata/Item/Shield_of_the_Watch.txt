'''''Shields of the Watch''''' were [[enchanted]] [[shield]]s from the land of [[Shaar]].

==Powers==
These small shields carried a ''+1 enchantment'' and offered additional defense, effectively becoming a ''+2 shield'' when wielded against humans.

==History==
''Shields of the Watch'' were created as a tribute to a [[wemic]] group called [[the Watch (Shaar)|the Watch]]. The group's true purpose was unknown; however, many claimed that the wemics were weapon and information dealers. [[Human]] nomads learned to trust the Watch. However, by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Watch was gone, and the shields created in the wemic name found their from Shaar to the city of [[Neverwinter]]
