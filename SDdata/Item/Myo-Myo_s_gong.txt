'''''Myo-Myo's gong''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[gong]] and a [[shield]] that once belonged to a famed ghost hunter [[Myo-Myo]] from [[Kara-Tur]].

==Powers==
When used as a shield, ''Myo-Myo's gong'' offered enchanted ''+2'' defenses to the wielder. Once per day, the shield's wielder could trike the gong, unleashing a wave of spiritual energy that burned demons, ghosts, and all sorts of evil spirits. This magic was similar to the effects of the ''[[holy smite]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
This gong was inscribed with geometric patterns and imbued with divine magics by the titular seven stone monks of the [[Seven Stone Monks Temple]] in [[T'u Lung]] for the famous ghost hunter Myo-Myo. As of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Myo-Myo's gong'' was in the hands of a conniving [[drow]] merchant, [[Nym (Icewind Dale)|Nym]], who traveled the [[North]] and sold his magical curios. The drow was still in possession of the gong during his visit to the [[Wandering Village]], east of the town of [[Kuldahar]] in [[1312 DR]].
