When used as a shield, Myo-Myos gong offered enchanted +2 defenses to the wielder. Once per day, the shields wielder could trike the gong, unleashing a wave of spiritual energy that burned demons, ghosts, and all sorts of evil spirits. This magic was similar to the effects of the holy smite spell.
This gong was inscribed with geometric patterns and imbued with divine magics by the titular seven stone monks of the Seven Stone Monks Temple in Tu Lung for the famous ghost hunter Myo-Myo.
