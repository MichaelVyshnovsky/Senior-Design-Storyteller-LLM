        "mainbody": "'''Nightviper venom''' was a [[poison]] extracted from the fangs of the [[nightviper]], a [[snake]] found in the [[Nelanther Isles]]. It was harvested by [[pirate]]s and sold to merchants in [[Skullport]] and [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "This milky white liquid had a slightly sweet taste. It could be mixed with water or alcohol and still retain its potency. It could also be administered through an open wound caused by a weapon treated with this substance. A single dose typically cost 600 gp.",
        "Effects": "Unless the victim was hardy enough to resist, this poison impaired a victim's judgement. Effects ranged from merely reducing inhibitions and making bad choices to falling into a complete stupor.",
        "Notable Users": "[[Elsk Thavarask]], the proprietor of the [[Missing Minotaur]] tavern in [[Everlund]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], was known to use this substance on occasion, and perhaps sell it to people he trusted."
