'''''Neekar''''' was a unique [[Intelligent item|intelligent]] [[broadsword]] that could communicate in any language native to the [[Prime Material plane]].{{Cite dragon/188/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A set of special swords from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}

==Description==
This [[steel]] broadsword had a rather plain, [[silver]] pommel and was sheathed in an [[ivory]] scabbard. It was created to be as inconspicuous as possible, giving only a faint aura of [[divination]].

The sword's personality had a particular pride in its ability to aid its wielder during negotiations and parleys.

==Powers==
While the blade possessed no [[magic]]al [[Item enchantment|enchantment]], it was capable of communication, speech, and could read non-magical writing. Its main power laid in its ability to speak any language that was native to the Prime plane, including ancient tongues and local dialects across [[Toril]]. While it could visually perceive in all directions and listen to all sounds within 60' (18.3Â m), it possessed no [[telepathic]] abilities.

==Creation==
While the sword was unique, it was known that the [[spell]] ''[[tongues]]'' was used in its creation.

==History==
This special sword first appeared in the treasury of a noble family of [[Waterdeep]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. At some point, ''Neekar'' was lost to rival nobility in a duel, who after a generation fell on hard times and wound up selling the blade. It was since used on the behalf of a number of individuals during diplomatic endeavors.
