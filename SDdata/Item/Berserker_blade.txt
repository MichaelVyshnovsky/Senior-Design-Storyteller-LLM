'''''Berserker blades''''' were magic swords that grew more powerful when their wielders fought with rage.

==Powers==
A ''berserker blade'' was normally a ''+1'' or ''+2 [[bastard sword]]'', but became a ''+2'' or ''+3'' sword when the wielder burst into a [[barbarian]]'s rage.

==Creation==
Creation required skill in forging magical weapons and the ''[[emotion]]'' spell.

==Users==
They were often used by warriors in [[Rashemen]], and were created for then by the [[Witches of Rashemen]].
