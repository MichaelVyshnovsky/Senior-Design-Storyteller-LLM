Berserker blades were magic swords that grew more powerful when their wielders fought with rage.
A berserker blade was normally a +1 or +2 bastard sword, but became a +2 or +3 sword when the wielder burst into a barbarians rage.
Creation required skill in forging magical weapons and the emotion spell.
They were often used by warriors in Rashemen, and were created for then by the Witches of Rashemen.
