        "mainbody": "Drops fallen from the moon\" was a name given to the holy essence of the goddess Selûne the Moonmaiden.\nSome avatars of Selûne trailed dancing lights known as \"moon motes\" or \"moondust\". At other times, Selûne manifested as only a trail of these moon motes. The moon motes could occasionally exude these drops. They were also believed to rain from the Tears of Selûne, the satellites that trailed after the moon, hence the name. Such drops also sometimes fell from the replica Wand of Four Moons kept in the House of the Moon temple in Waterdeep by 1369 DR.\nThe drops formed a radiant, sparkling, pearly-hued liquid.\nBelieving them to be gifts from the goddess, the Selûnite clergy collected these drops and valued them greatly. They were a powerful ingredient in many beneficial potions, unguents, and healing drafts and ointments. Such potions could grant infravision from sunset to sunrise or keep one awake through the night while still receiving the benefits of a full nights sleep."
