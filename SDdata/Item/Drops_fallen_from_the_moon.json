        "Creation": "Some [[avatar]]s of Selûne trailed dancing lights known as \"moon motes\" or \"moondust\". At other times, Selûne manifested as only a trail of these moon motes. The moon motes could occasionally exude these drops. They were also believed to rain from the [[Tears of Selûne]], the satellites that trailed after the [[moon]], hence the name. Such drops also sometimes fell from the replica ''[[Wand of Four Moons]]'' kept in the [[House of the Moon]] temple in [[Waterdeep]] by [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "The drops formed a radiant, sparkling, pearly-hued liquid.",
        "Uses": "Believing them to be gifts from the goddess, the [[church of Selûne|Selûnite clergy]] collected these drops and valued them greatly. They were a powerful ingredient in many beneficial [[potion]]s, unguents, and healing drafts and ointments. Such potions could grant [[infravision]] from sunset to sunrise or keep one awake through the night while still receiving the benefits of a full night's sleep."
