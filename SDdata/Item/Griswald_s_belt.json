        "mainbody": "Griswalds belt was an enchanted belt that once belonged to the famous knight of Baldurs Gate, Grisbane the Great.\nThe belts magics boosted the wearers strength and improved their fortitude. Additionally, Griswalds belt allowed the wearer to cast the true strike spell once per day.\nEven though Griswalds belt bore the name of Sir Griswald, a 14 century DR noble knight of Baldurs Gate, the belts original owner was his grandfather â€“ a famous knight named Grisbane the Great, who lived and gained fame for his noble deeds sometime before . In 1372 DR, Griswald wore his belt to the siege of Castle Exeltis to the south west Daggerford trying to rescue his beloved \"princess\" Soliana. Sir Griswald was ready to offer the precious belt as the reward for aid in infiltration of the impregnable cliffside castle."
