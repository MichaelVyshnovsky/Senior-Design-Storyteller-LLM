'''''Sundering''''' was a [[weapon quality]] that could be applied to bludgeoning or slashing weapons.

==Power==
A weapon imbued with the ''sundering'' property caused additional harm as the [[magic]] attempted to shatter whatever it came in contact with.

==Creation==
A [[cleric]] used the ''[[shatter]]'' [[spell]] to add the ''sundering'' effect to a weapon.
