}}'''''Namarra''''', also known as '''''Neversleep''''', was the name worn by three different [[enchanted]] [[Rapier|rapiers]] of differing origins that probably fell into the hands of several different [[Adventurer|adventurers]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].[[BioWare]] (June 2002). Designed by [[Brent Knowles]], [[James Ohlen]]. ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari Atari].[[BioWare]] (December 2003). Designed by [[Brent Knowles]]. ''[[Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark]]''. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari Atari].
==Powers==
Each of the three different rapiers possessed different but similar powers that were connected to sleeping.

The probably weakest version of ''Namarra'' possessed a +''1'' enchantment that made the [[weapon]] deadlier and guided its blade toward the wielders target. With every hit there was a chance for the [[blade]] to [[daze]] opponents for around 12 seconds.

Another ''Namarra'' was enchanted with a +''2'' enchantment. With every hit there was a chance for the [[blade]] to put the target to [[sleep]] for around 12 seconds.

The probably most powerful version of the [[weapon]] bore a +''8'' enchantment and was also able to put opponents to sleep for around 12 seconds on successful hits. In contrast to the +''2'' version of the weapon, this was much more likely because it was harder to resist the effect of this weapon. Only the most powerful of adventurers could wield it.
==History==
The three rapiers had different origins.

The dazing version of ''Namarra'' was forged by the [[dwarf]] [[Marrok]], a blacksmith from [[Neverwinter]] who worked at the [[Shining Knight Arms & Armor|Shining Knight Arms and Armor]]. The weapon was created in order to help the adventurers that sought to rid the city of Neverwinter from the [[Wailing Death]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. To make the weapon, an enchanted rapier and a vial of [[dragon]] blood were required. After the plague, the rapier was able to be acquired around the area of Neverwinter.

The +''2''  rapier was forged by the dwarf [[Barun]], a blacksmith who worked from a makeshift [[forge]] in the [[Uthgardt]] [[village]] of [[Beorunna's Well]]. The weapon was created to aid the war effort against [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]], who was marching against Neverwinter and the [[Lords' Alliance|Lord's Alliance]] in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. To craft the weapon, an enchanted rapier and a vial of dragon blood were required. After the plague, the rapier found its way into the possession of the smith [[Jacoby]] who probably worked in [[Crossroad Keep]] in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.

The +''8'' weapons origin was unknown. It previously belonged to and was associated with the [[gnome]] [[Feckle Raspude]]. Feckle was a [[swashbuckler]] who used his ''Namarra'' to put opponents who challenged him to duels to sleep. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, this weapon could be found among the wares available at the [[Quarry Office]] in the [[City of Lost Souls]].
