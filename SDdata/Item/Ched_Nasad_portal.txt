The so-called '''Ched Nasad ''portal''''' was a [[portal]] that connected the [[drow]] city of [[Ched Nasad]] with the [[Dalelands]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Dark Elf Portals: The Ched Nasad Portal}}

==Geography==
The Ched Nasad ''portal'', like any other portal consisted of two gates: an [[Underdark]] one in Ched Nasad and a surface one in the [[Dalelands]], namely [[Deepingdale]].

The Underdark end was found in a tunnel in the subterranean city's vicinity. In fact, the tunnel was well-traveled, and the surface end was connected with a [[drow]] community on the surface.

==Owners==
The ''portal'' was owned by a cell of the [[church of Vhaeraun]] active in Ched Nasad and in Deepingdale. The Underdark one consisted mostly of disenfranchised male [[drow]] and the surface one a larger settlement that followed the faith of [[Vhaeraun]].

The ''portal'' was a close-guarded secret of the church. In fact they had their [[rogue]] and [[assassin]] members stationed in the ''portal's'' vicinity to organize the deaths of people who stumbled upon it.

==Uses==
The Ched Nasad ''portal'' was effectively a smuggling route. It allowed access to a reliable source of [[riding lizard]]s, [[fungi]], and other Underdark goods for the surface drow and an easy access to necessities like food and water, It also allowed quick allocation of other resources like manpower between these groups for their respective aims of hurting Ched Nasad's matriarchy and Deepingdale's population.

The ''portal'' was always accessible on the Underdark side and only after sunset on the surface side. The ''portal'' was impossible to access for their enemies because it was keyed to a male divine caster,

The Underdark cell was also active in causing a shortage of the necessities like food and water to which they had easy access to. They planned to weaken Lolth's matriarchy and eventually take over the city.
