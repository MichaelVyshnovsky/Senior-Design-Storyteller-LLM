'''''Writs of the Vizier''''' were [[enchanted]] [[light flail]]s created by [[Bertrand the Helper]].

==Powers==
''Writs of the Vizier'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and had a coin toss of a chance to affect the targets with magical ''[[fear]]'' for twelve seconds.

==History==
The first of these flails was enchanted by Bertrand the Helper around a century before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. ''Writs of the Vizier'' quickly found a way into courts of numerous rulers. However, details of these courts and where the flails came from remained undocumented. Traditionally, ''Writs of the Vizier'' were handled by the most trusted individuals of the court, such as deputies and assistants. Most of the time, these relationships were quite secretive and the ownership of ''Writs of the Vizier'' was kept just as secret.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some of these flails could be found in the hands of merchants and individuals along the [[Sword Coast]], the cities of [[Neverwinter]] and  [[Fort Locke]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Jacoby]], Fort Locke' weaponsmith ''circa'' 1374 DR.
