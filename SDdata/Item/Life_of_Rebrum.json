        "mainbody": "The Life of Rebrum was a bawdy autobiography of the life of the traveling merchant Rebrum of Sheirtalar. It was written around 1210 DR and was frequently copied.\nIn it, among other things, Rebrum wrote of the \"Eleave\" trade-fair in Vaerndoun in the Underdark. Here, Rebrum mentioned a group of drow traders, sent by their matrons, who attempted to barter the Chanting Chain, a holy relic of Talos the Destroyer, to another group of drow from a distant city."
