A '''chain''' was a linear series of rings, linked together, that was usually crafted from metal.

{{Quote|[[Rope]]s and chains are the sinew of civilization.|An old [[Dwarf|dwarven]] proverb}}

==Description==
A typical chain was about {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} long and weighed from {{SIrange|2|3|lb|k|long=yes}}. Market prices varied wildly, ranging from as little as 5 [[silver piece]]s to as much as 30 [[gold piece]]s. Longer, {{SIAdj|25|ft|long=yes}} chains were sold by [[Aurora's Emporium]] in all manner of sizes. Depending on the thickness and material, they could bear various loads, as depicted in the following table.
