Hastsezinis shield was a powerful enchanted tower shield that belonged to famously law-abiding mercenary Hastsezini from Riatavin.
Hastsezinis shield possessed a +5 enchantment. This tower shields magics prevented any non law-venerating creature from handling it.
Hastsezinis shield earliest history was when it appeared in the hands of the legendary mercenary Hastsezini. He managed to convince five of the greatest Riatavin wizard competitors to pool together their valuables and have them be guarded by Hastsezini. The mercenary never was tempted to dip into the magicians treasures and no shelf was ever attempted, and Hastsezini received full pay from all five of his wealthy employers.
Eventually, Hastsezinis shield traveled up the Sword Coast and reached the vicinity of Neverwinter in 1372 DR. By 1373 DR, the tower shield traveled to the city of Hillsfar and was in the hands of the clerics of the Vault of Swords.
