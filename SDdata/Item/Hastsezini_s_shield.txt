'''''Hastsezini's shield''''' was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[tower shield]] that belonged to famously law-abiding mercenary [[Hastsezini]] from [[Riatavin]].

==Powers==
''Hastsezini's shield'' possessed a ''+5'' enchantment. This tower shield's magics prevented any non law-venerating creature from handling it.

==History==
''Hastsezini's shield'' earliest history was when it appeared in the hands of the legendary mercenary Hastsezini. He managed to convince five of the greatest Riatavin [[wizard]] competitors to pool together their valuables and have them be guarded by Hastsezini. The mercenary never was tempted to dip into the magicians' treasures and no shelf was ever attempted, and Hastsezini received full pay from all five of his wealthy employers.

Eventually, ''Hastsezini's shield'' traveled up the [[Sword Coast]] and reached the vicinity of [[Neverwinter]] in [[1372 DR]]. By [[1373 DR]], the tower shield traveled to the city of [[Hillsfar]] and was in the hands of the [[cleric]]s of [[the Vault of Swords]].
