        "mainbody": "ypersthene, also known as bronzite, was a gemstone usually cut cabochon.\nThis semi-precious stone was brown and opaque (sometimes reddish or greenish) and contained silvery spangles. It was rare to find an unflawed piece larger than &nbspin (13&nbspmm) across, and as a result the stone yielded small gemstones. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.\nCarrying or wearing one of these gemstones made the bearer undetectable by the wyvern watch spell. In common parlance this property was known as wyvern warding."
