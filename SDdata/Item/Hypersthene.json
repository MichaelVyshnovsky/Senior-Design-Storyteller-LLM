        "Description": "This [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] was brown and opaque (sometimes reddish or greenish) and contained silvery spangles. It was rare to find an unflawed piece larger than {{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;in (13&nbsp;mm) across, and as a result the stone yielded small gemstones. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.",
        "Powers": "Carrying or wearing one of these gemstones made the bearer undetectable by the ''[[wyvern watch]]'' spell. In common parlance this property was known as wyvern warding."
