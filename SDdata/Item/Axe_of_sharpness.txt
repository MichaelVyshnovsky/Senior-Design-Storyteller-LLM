An axe of sharpness was an enchanted battleaxe that could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.
A blow from an axe of sharpness always drew more blood than a blow from a regular axe. In addition, the wielder could sometime pull off a maneuver to sweep cleanly into an enemy, wounding them massively and leaving them struggling to defend themselves from subsequent attacks.
