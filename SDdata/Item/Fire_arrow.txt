'''''Fire arrows''''', also known as '''arrows of fire''', were [[enchanted]] [[arrow]]s that burst into flames.

==Powers==
When fired, ''fire arrows'' immediately became alit with flames. Once they reached their targets, ''fire arrows'' pierced it and singed it with fire. Creatures native to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] were unaffected by these flames but still suffered piercing damage from the missiles themselves. These arrows also had a chance of lightning the targets clothes on fire.

==History==
In the late 13{{th}} and early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''arrows of flame'' were in common use in the frigid [[Icewind Dale]] and the [[Ten Towns]].
By the mid and late 14{{th}} century DR, ''fire arrows'' were used across the [[Sword Coast]]. [[Halbazzer Drin]] of [[Sorcerous Sundries]] carried these magic missiles in stock in [[Baldur's Gate]].
