        "mainbody": "A greataxe was a double-bladed, two-handed melee weapon in the axe family.\nThe greataxe was a large, heavy battleaxe with a double-bladed head. The shaft was usually constructed of stout wood and longer than even a dwarven waraxe, with about half that length being just the grip alone.\nWielded two-handed, the double blades allowed an alternating forward/backswing attack with devastating results. Because they required some training to use effectively, greataxes were typically considered a martial weapon.\n* Barbarians tended to favor the greataxe for their tremendous lethality."
