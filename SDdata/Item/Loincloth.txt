'''Loincloths''' were a variety of undergarment found in the Realms, either worn by itself or under another article of clothing.

==Description==
They typically consisted of a mere strip of cloth.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold a variety of upgirding loincloths that were suitable for [[elves]], [[halfling]]s, [[human]]s, and [[gnome]]s. Available materials included [[leather]], [[linen]], [[silk]], [[velvet]], [[wool]], and a weave of absorbent [[cotton]] from [[Maztica]].

Around that same time, the business [[Boom's Garden]], who sold some of their clothing through ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'', sold loincloths made from a variety of materials. These included [[bear]] or [[wolf]] fur, stiff and supple leather, leather with [[iron]] studs protuding from the exterior, [[chain mail]], [[scale mail]], and [[plate mail]]. Additionally, for customers worried about pinching or pulling, Boom's Garden offered an inner lining of cotton for their armored loincloths.
