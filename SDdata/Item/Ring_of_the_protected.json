        "mainbody": "The '''''ring of the protected''''' was the unique [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that belonged to Magister [[Luther]] of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "This ring was created out intricately of weaved together [[platinum]] bands.",
        "Powers": "The ''ring of the protected'' was imbued with enchantments that enhanced the wearer's defense and improved their protections against many physical and magical effects.",
        "History": "Magister Luther was one of the ancient heroes interred within one of the crypts within the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the ''ring of the protected'' was still on its master's finger. His spirit, along with several other heroes' in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the Weeping War. If the ring was ever removed from the sarcophagus, Luther's [[wraith]] was there to punish the grave-robbers."
