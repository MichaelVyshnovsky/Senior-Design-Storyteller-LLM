In 1369 DR, the ring of the protected was still on its masters finger. His spirit, along with several other heroes in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the Weeping War. If the ring was ever removed from the sarcophagus, Luthers wraith was there to punish the grave-robbers."
