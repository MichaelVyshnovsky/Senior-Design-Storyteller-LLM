They were always locked, and often had magical barriers to prevent them from being opened.\nWhenever a creature would touch or pass through a wraith doorway they had their life slowly drained from them. If they died from this, they would come back in a short time as a wraith. When this doorway was destroyed, it would release the dread wraith from within."
