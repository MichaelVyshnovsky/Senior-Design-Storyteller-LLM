'''''Shield amulets''''' were pieces of [[enchanted]] jewelry imbued with defensive magics.

==Description==
Some of these [[amulet]]s were small pieces of jewelry carved of stone. Each item's [[command word]] was often engraved on the amulet.

==Powers==
These amulets held several charges of the ''[[shield]]'' [[spell]], activated with a simple uttering of their command words. When activated, magic ''shield'' briefly enveloped the wearer, repelling attacks and completely diffusing ''[[magic missile]]s'' thrown at it. Each amulet could contain up to 24 charges of the spell.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, ''shield amulets'' could be purchased at the traveling carnival perched east of the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Nashkel]].
