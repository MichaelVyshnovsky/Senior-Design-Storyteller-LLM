        "mainbody": "Fire arrows, also known as arrows of fire, were enchanted arrows that burst into flames.\nWhen fired, fire arrows immediately became alit with flames. Once they reached their targets, fire arrows pierced it and singed it with fire. Creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Fire were unaffected by these flames but still suffered piercing damage from the missiles themselves. These arrows also had a chance of lightning the targets clothes on fire.\nIn the late 13 and early 14 century DR, arrows of flame were in common use in the frigid Icewind Dale and the Ten Towns.\nBy the mid and late 14 century DR, fire arrows were used across the Sword Coast. Halbazzer Drin of Sorcerous Sundries carried these magic missiles in stock in Baldurs Gate."
