Staves of vision were enchanted staves that gave the wielder access to four vision-related spells.
A staff of vision  contained the darkvision, remove blindness and see invisibility spells, and two copies of the true seeing spell. Each time one of these was used, there was a chance that the caster would become mentally fatigued. It was worth around 43,000 gold pieces.
The creation process of a staff of vision was possible for someone skilled in staff-crafting. The spells needed for the creation included darkvision, see invisibility, remove blindness, and true seeing.
