'''''Healing Hands''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves used by the healers of the [[Church of Lathander]].

==Description==
There white-dyed [[leather]] gloves were branded with [[Lathander]]'s ''[[holy symbol]]'' depicting a rising sun.

==Powers==
''Healing Hands'' were enchanted to aid their wearers in administering healing. Additionally, they held five charges of the ''[[cure light wounds]]'' spell that could be cast once a day.

==History==
Most churches gave out minor enchanted items that were imbued with their deities' divinity. ''Healing Hands'' were giving out to Lathanderite priests who were tasked with healing the needy. In the late 14{{th}} century DR, healers of the temple of Lathander in [[Westgate]] wore these items and offered them in exchange for a hefty donation to the church's subjects.
