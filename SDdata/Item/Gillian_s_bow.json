        "mainbody": "'''''Gillian's bow''''' was the [[enchanted]] [[longbow]] that belonged to [[Gillian Cantilar]], the defender of the [[Trade Way]] and the namesake of the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]].",
        "Powers": "''Gillian's bow'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment. The weapon was also fitted with an ingenious sighting mechanism of [[gnome|gnomish]] creation. It gave ''Gillian's bow'' range, dramatically longer than other longbows, and gave the weapon the ability to deal devastating critical damage when its arrows reached their targets dead-center.",
        "History": "This enchanted bow faithfully served Gillian Cantilar, the [[half-elven]] [[ranger]] hero of the Trade Way. By [[1372 DR]], ''Gillian's bow'' was in the hands of [[Gillian's Hill Gang]], a group of bandits who took over the fire cairn tower on the hill's summit and menaced the locals and traveling merchants."
