'''Mintar Gold''' were a variety of [[wine]] exported out of the city of [[Mintar]] in the [[Land of the Lions]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a high shipment of Mintar Gold, over over 2,000 bottles, was brought to [[the Vast]] by [[Georborg Fireblade]], a wine merchant from Mintar. He sold a bottle for a single [[gold]] [[Raven (coin)|raven]]. Mintar Gold was also used in the wine tasting competition during the year end celebration of the {{YearlinkName|1371}} in [[Mossbridges]].
