        "mainbody": "Luiren Rivengut was a notoriously strong whiskey drink created by the halflings of Luiren.\nCommonly distilled and aged in Luiren, this clear alcoholic liquid was infamous throughout the Western Heartlands for its potency.\nHalflings used Rivengut to disinfect cuts and bruises as often as they used it to get drunk.\nLike many halflings, a famous Harper agent and \"bard\" Olive Ruskettle was a lover of the deadly whiskey. She often carried a flask of the liquid on her circa 1358 DR.\nGiogioni Wyvernspur carried a flask of this hard liquor on him in 1358 DR. Both he and his future wife Cat enjoyed Rivengut.\nAnother Harper agent and a nobleman from Waterdeep, Danilo Thann, always carried flasks of alcohol in his bag of holding, one of them being Luiren Rivengut."
