Potions of glibness, also known as philters of glibness, was a potion that mimicked the effects of the glibness spell.
Those who imbibed a potion of glibness had their speech altered to sound smooth and convincing, no matter what lie they told. When put under magical scrutiny, such as by the spell detect lie, they will at the might be perceived as somewhat misrepresenting information. If put under a magical effect would force them to speak truthfully, such as zone of truth, an imbiber had a chance to resist. The chance of fibbing being detected was even less for charlatan bards that imbibed.

Sometime around 1367 DR, an Al-Badia student at the College of Religion and Science in Qadib by the name of Aziz al Kajam had squandered his study opportunities and abysmally in his courses to the point that he was kicked out. Worried of what his father and tribe would think of him, the young man panicked and before leaving the city stole a philter of glibness from the college laboratory, one of many minor potions that he had been studying in his course on basic magic. When he returned to his tribes home in the Furrowed Mountains he imbibed this philter of glibness, using its powers to spin an elaborate lie of his natural philosophy teacher Hakim ibn Rashad having it out for him because of him being an Al-Badian. The philter of glibness was so effective that it managed to fool both his father, Diyab al Kaban, and his tribes hakima.
