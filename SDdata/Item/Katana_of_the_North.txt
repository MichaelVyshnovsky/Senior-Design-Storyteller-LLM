The '''''Katana of the North''''' was a magical [[katana]] found in [[northwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
It was forged by [[monk]]s of a small religious order based in the [[Nether Mountains]]. It was intended to aid the wielder in weathering the elements and soothing beasts they came across.It is unknown which monastic order or which deity they follow. One candidate is the [[Lady's Hand Monastery]], dedicated to [[Loviatar]].

The ''Katana of the North'' may have turned up in the [[Sword Coast North]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
The katana was observed to have a wide guard.

==Powers==
With it, the wielder attacked more accurately and dealt more severe injuries. They also gained an edge in handling and influencing [[animal]]s and they could gain the benefit of ''[[endure elements]]'' twice a day.
