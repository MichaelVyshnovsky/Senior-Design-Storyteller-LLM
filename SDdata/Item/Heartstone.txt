A heartstone was a specific type of gemstone associated with the malevolent night hags. They held within them several different magical properties.
They each appeared as a glossy black gem.
Night hags were each required to craft their own heartstone, a process that took 30 days.
When a night hag had her heartstone in her possession, she could become ethereal at will. Additionally, mere contact with a heartstone would cure an individual of any disease with which they were afflicted.

* Widow Groat, one of the Sewn Sisters that helped craft the Soulmonger for the lich Acererak.
* Wormriddle, denizen of Dweomercore within Undermountain.
