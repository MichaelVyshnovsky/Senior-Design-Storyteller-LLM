A '''''heartstone''''' was a specific type of [[gemstone]] associated with the malevolent [[night hag]]s. They held within them several different [[magic]]al properties.

==Description==
They each appeared as a glossy black gem.

Night hags were each required to craft their own ''heartstone'', a process that took 30 days.

==Powers==
When a night hag had her ''heartstone'' in her possession, she could ''[[etherealness|become ethereal]]'' at will. Additionally, mere contact with a ''heartstone'' would cure an individual of any [[disease]] with which they were afflicted.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Mad Maggie]], the night hag leader of the [[Knucklebones Gang]] in [[Avernus]].
* [[Widow Groat]], one of the [[Sewn Sisters]] that helped craft the ''[[Soulmonger]]'' for the [[lich]] [[Acererak]].
* [[Wormriddle]], denizen of [[Dweomercore]] within [[Undermountain]].
