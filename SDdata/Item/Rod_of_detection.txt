Rods of detection were magic rods that were used to detect concealed things and bludgeon ones opponent over the head.
Rods of detection possessed no enchantments to their offensive powers, effectively being clubs, but when wielded as rods, the weapons revealed all things concealed my magic close by.
One of the rods of detection was given to the Hero of Daggerford by Astriel Shalyn in 1372 DR to investigate the basement of the Black Stone Inn. The rod revealed a hidden trapdoor that led the adventurers to a Zhentarim lair.
