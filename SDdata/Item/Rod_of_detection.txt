'''''Rods of detection''''' were magic [[rod]]s that were used to detect concealed things and bludgeon one's opponent over the head.

{{quote|In order to use it, just hold your hand. The rod will glow if you are in the pretense of something concealed by magic.|[[Astriel Shalyn]]}}

==Powers==
''Rods of detection'' possessed no enchantments to their offensive powers, effectively being [[club]]s, but when wielded as rods, the weapons revealed all things concealed my magic close by.

==History==
One of the ''rods of detection'' was given to the [[Hero of Daggerford]] by Astriel Shalyn in [[1372 DR]] to investigate the basement of the [[Black Stone Inn]]. The rod revealed a hidden trapdoor that led the adventurers to a [[Zhentarim]] lair.
