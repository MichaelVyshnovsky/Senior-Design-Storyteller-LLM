        "mainbody": "A foldable chest was an enchanted chest of drawers that was small and portable enough for an adventurer to carry. They could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nEach drawer of the foldable chest contained an extra-dimensional (space similar to a bag of holding), allowing the owner to not only carry but organize all of the supplies they needed for their plans.\n* Jarlaxle, the legendary drow leader of Bregan Daerthe, owned several extra-dimensional storage spaces, including a foldable chest, a bottomless pouch, a bag of holding, and a portable hole."
