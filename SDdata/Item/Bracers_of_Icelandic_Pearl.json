        "mainbody": "Bracers of Icelandic Pearl were immensely powerful enchanted couple of bracers imbued with elemental and wither magics.\nApart from a powerful defensive +4 magic, bracers of Icelandic Pearl reduced the wearers dexterity. In exchange for that, they were given the ability to summon a water elemental once per day through lesser planar binding, cast a powerful version of the cone of cold spell once per day, and use the Abi-Dalzims horrid wilting spell once per day.\nStories of bracers of Icelandic Pearl claimed they were created shortly before the  somewhere between the Spine of the World and the coast of the Sea of Moving Ice. Their creator was a stubborn abjurer Prashnak who came into a conflict with a relentless scourge of trolls who wanted the mages dug-out, well-stationed bower. Prashnak defended himself through summoned showers of acid but eventually got tired of fending for his life with no end as the attackers grew bolder.\nPrashnak spent months studying and developing various elemental conjurations, wilting, and freezing spells, and imbued all these magics onto Bracers of Icelandic Pearl. The hard work culminated in the abjurer summoning a water elemental and, through magic, evaporating parts of its body and finally freezing what was left. This horrific sculpture of elemental ice was so offensive to the trolls sensibilities that they fled, leaving the mage alone. It was unknown what cunning thief stole Prashnaks bracers, but as of the , they had been missing for years. Despite the loss, abjurer Prashnak was still alive and working on his woeful studies.\n*Hobart Stubbletoes, who lured the heroes of Icewind Dale to Castle Maluradek in Anauroch in 1281 DR.\n*Cult of Auril, that allied with the Legion of the Chimera and erected a massive ice temple to the goddess in Icewind Dale in 1312 DR."
