Ring of blessing was an enchanted ring, that resembled a shiny golden band, from the ancient city of Myth Drannor.
The aptly named magic ring was enchanted to allow the wearer to cast the bless spell at will. The ring held five charges of the spell.
Before the Weeping War, a ring of blessing was among the enchanted items used by the inhabitants of the City of Song. In 1368 DR, one of these rings could be found on the deepest levels of the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. The ring was looted from ancient elven tombs by a band of orog marauders.
