'''Snake soup''' was a food prepared using [[snake]] meat, most common in the city of [[Crimmor]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
Hot snake soup was a common delicacy in Crimmor due to a high population of snakes that fed on its abundant [[rat]]s. If the meat in a soup or stew was hard to identify â€“ it was likely snake. A common practice among Crimmor eateries was hiding snake heads in soups served to out-of-towners.

Cold snake soup was a part of [[elf|elvish]] cuisine. It was prepared using four types of beheaded snakes and cooked in water until the skin was easily peeled.
