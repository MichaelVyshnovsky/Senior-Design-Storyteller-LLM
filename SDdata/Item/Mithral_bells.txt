'''Mithral bells''' were a type of enchanted bracelet.

==Description==
These bracelets consisted of a small [[mithral]] [[chain]] of eleven mithral bells.

==Powers==
Each of the elven bells that adorned these bracelets could be thrown as a grenade weapon, detonating with a ''[[sound burst]]'' effect. The bell would explode after {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} if it did not strike something first.

Additionally, while being worn the wearer would find greater success at attempted artistic performances, provided at least three bells remained on the mithral chain.

==Creation==
''Mithral bells'' could only be crafted by [[bard]]s.
