        "mainbody": "The Claws of the Jade Panther were gloves that were used as a deadly weapon by the infamous Shou monk only known as the Jade Panther.\nEach glove had three razor-sharp claw-shaped blades attached to them. Specifically designed to be worn by monks, these gloves allowed them not only to shower their opponents with bludgeoning fist punches but also slash them open with the gloves blades.\nOriginally owned by the Jade Panther, these gloves were stolen by Li Mai, the Panthers lover. She felt that the Panther became too cruel and ordered one of her servants to destroy the Claws. However, the gloves were sold on a black market instead. Eventually, in the late 14 century DR, the Claws were exported out of Shou Lung and were sold at Okuzos Imports of Westgate."
