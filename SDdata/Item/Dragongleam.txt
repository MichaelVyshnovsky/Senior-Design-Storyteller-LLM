Dragongleam was an enchanted spear that remained in possession of the Cult of the Dragon as of the late 15 century DR.
The spear had the phrase "Tiamats eyes shine" inscribed upon its crossguard in the Iokharic script.
Dragongleam was empowered with ten charges of the spell daylight.
As of the 1480s DR, it could be found within the cults hunting lodge in the Greypeak Mountains.
