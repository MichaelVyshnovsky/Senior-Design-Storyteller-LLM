A '''''phylactery of monstrous attention''''' was a deadly cursed [[magic item]].

==Description==
A ''phylactery of monstrous attention'' was a [[Phylactery (religious item)|priest's phylactery]] that took the form of an arm wrapping.

==Powers==
A priest wearing a ''phylactery of monstrous attention'' attracted the attention of supernatural creatures of an alignment opposite their own, causing them to be beset with such foes wherever they were or could appear. For [[cleric]]s powerful enough to cast spells like ''[[raise dead]]'', the phylactery went so far as to attract the attention of their deity's greatest foe.

Once donned, the phylactery could only be removed through an ''[[exorcise]]'' or ''[[wish]]'' spell, followed by a quest to re-establish the priest in their alignment.

==History==
One was still hidden within the [[Temple of Set]] within the [[Oasis of the White Palm]] as of {{yearlink|1356}}.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|75}}
