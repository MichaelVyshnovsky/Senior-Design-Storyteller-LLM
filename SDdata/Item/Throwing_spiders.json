        "mainbody": "'''Throwing spiders''' were metallic weapons similar to [[shuriken]] with extremely sharp edges.",
        "Description": "These weapons were stylized to look like [[spider]]s by the [[drow]]. If left in an area strong with [[faerzress]], they became supernaturally sharp, capable of digging into wood and even stone with ease.",
        "Notable Wielders": "Before leaving the Underdark, [[Liriel Baenre]] used to visit [[Zz'Pzora]]'s lair and leave objects in the intense faerzress of the location, hoping those items absorbed some of the magical emanations.\n{{Quote|To buy a moment’s time, Liriel hurled a throwing spider at the hideous golem. The magic-enhanced weapon bit deep into the creature's throat. It would surely have killed a living creature; the golem had no blood to shed. It bared its fangs and kept coming.}}[[Xzorsh]] was given a few of these weapons, which were bestowed a different enchantment by Liriel. They would burrow into anything they were pressed against, be it flesh or even wood, which made them extremely lethal.<ref>Elaine Cunningham (May 1998). Tangled Webs. (Wizards of the Coast).
