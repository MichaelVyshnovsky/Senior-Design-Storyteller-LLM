A '''''ring of armoring''''' was a [[magic item]] that enhanced any [[wizard]]'s [[spell]]s that created armor effects.

==Powers==
A wearer of this [[ring]] was granted extra protection when casting such spells as ''[[mage armor]]'' or [[Shield (spell)|''shield'']] by strengthing the force field created by such spells.

==Notable Owners==
At least one of the wizards who fought with the [[Moonlight Men]] against the [[orc]]s of the [[Nethertide Horde]] in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]] wore one of these rings. It was buried with the wizard in the [[Cairn of Moonlight]] in [[Turnstone Pass]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}
