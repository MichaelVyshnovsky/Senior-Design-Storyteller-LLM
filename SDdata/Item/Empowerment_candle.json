        "mainbody": "An '''''empowerment candle''''' was a special magic item made by [[mystic]]s in the Realms. It increased spellcasting and weapon effectiveness to their greatest potential.",
        "Description": "''Empowerment candles'' were silver in color and intended to be burned in ten-minute intervals. The longest-lasting candle that could be created burned for ninety minutes. For [[neutral]] mystics, this was the seventh type of candle they learned to make when studying [[candle magic]]. [[Good]] and [[evil]] mystics could learn to make this candle after they reached a sufficiently high level.",
        "Powers": "After burning for the desired amount of time and then being extinguished (either by blowing, snuffing, dousing, or reaching the end of its wick), this candle granted the subject maximum proficiency in spellcasting ability similar to a brick of ''[[incense of meditation]]''. Both [[divine magic|divine]] and [[arcane]] spellcasters could make use of this candle. Empowered recipients were able to achieve the maximum range, area, duration, damage, ''etc.'' when casting spells for one hour for each ten-minute interval the candle was lit.\n\nWeapon use by empowered recipients was also enhanced so that weapons did the greatest harm (based on the size and/or type of weapon) with each successful attack.\n\nThe subject had to remain within ten feet (three meters) of the burning candle for the entire time it was lit and when it was extinguished or that application of the ''candle'' was wasted."
