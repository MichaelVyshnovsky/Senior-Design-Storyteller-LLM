'''''Corpsegrinder''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[maul]], known for its reliability and being the best company for travelers who ventured across dangerous locales of [[Faerûn]].

==Powers==
''Corpsegrinder's'' ''+2'' enchantment guided the wielder's hand towards the target and increased the bludgeon's damage, making it useful when wielding against creatures unaffected by non-magical weapons. Each attack with a ''Corpsegrinder'' exploded in a thunderclap of concussive force, dealing additional thunder damage.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''Corpsegrinder'' was wielded by the shady [[tiefling]] thug [[Cairos]], a member of the [[Stone Lord]]'s gang that opposed the [[Guild]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].
