The '''heartland flier''' was an experimental flying machine developed by [[Nadul DaRoni]] in his pursuit for purely mechanical flight.
{{Quote
|I wished to make also a flier that lets one man fly alone, like the birds do.

==Description==
In addition to the [[air screw]] and [[doubles wheel]], DaRoni also developed a small single-person winged vehicle. The user would lay flat on the heartboard and strap their hands and feet into the stirrups. By pedalling their feet and sweeping with their arms (as if performing a breaststroke) the flier's wings would flap quickly and forcefully. If used appropriately (and with more than a little luck) the flier would rise and move forwards surprisingly quickly, though it still took a very strong and tireless person to operate without immediately crashing.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered the doubles wheel built by Nadul DaRoni, valued at 45 [[gp]].
