Keryths Helm was a unique enchanted helmet worn by the elf general Keryth Blackhelm. In fact, Keryth took his surname from this helm.
The helm was made from black metal and inset with a single red gem surrounded in silver.
The helm imparted the benefits of an anti-magic shell when worn. The helm also allowed the wearer to regenerate their health at an alarming rate provided they were still alive.
