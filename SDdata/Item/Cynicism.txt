'''''Cynicism''''' was an enchanted and sentient [[longsword]] that housed the spirit of [[Ilfain Blackfeather]], a notorious [[elf|elven]] [[thief]].

==Description==
''Cynicism'' was a slim sword with a greenish tint to its blade and a [[gold]]en knuckle guard.

==Powers==
''Cynicism'' was created using a master-thief's spirit, which imbued the blade with enchantments that allowed the wielder to detect traps as if they were a skilled rogue themselves, and it allowed the wielder to cast the ''[[knock]]'' spell once per day within the {{SIAdj|50'|'"|long=yes}} range.

==History==
The history of ''Cynicism'' began in the {{YearlinkName|834}}, when one extremely cynical and skilled thief, Ilfain Blackfeather, attempted to burglarize a wizard tower that belonged to [[Legedain the Wiser]]. The aged mage decided to use the young elf burglar's body to replace his frail husk. Using the ''[[magic jar]]'' spell, Legedain trapped Ilfain Blackfeather's spirit within a [[gem]]stone and took over the new young body. A hundred years later, ''circa'' [[934 DR]], the [[wizard]] decided to do something with the prison gem. Legedain the Wiser created a slim green-hued enchanted sword for his bodyguard [[Gundark]] and transferred Ilfain Blackfeather's spirit into the blade. Gundark became exposed to the sword's ''[[telepathic]]'' criticisms and nitpicked every time the bodyguard used it in combat. Gundark managed to stomach the blade's jabs for only two weeks. After that, the green blade ended up in a pile of garbage on the street. Over the following centuries, this scenario repeated itself many times, with warriors picking up the sword and soon discarding it over its telepathic insults. Eventually, the sword became known under the name ''Cynicism''.

Subsequently, in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''Cynicism'' ended up in the hands of [[Edion Caradoc]], an aging [[necromancer]] who resided on the [[Burial Isle]] of [[Icewind Dale]], among numerous other enchanted items, which were flush with magic.
