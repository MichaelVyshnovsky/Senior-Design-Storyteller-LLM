        "mainbody": "'''''Cleansing medallions''''' were a type of small [[amulet]]s imbued with healing magics but not associated with any faith in particular.",
        "Description": "These medallions were small round [[silver]] disks that radiated an aura of well-being and comfort.",
        "Powers": "''Cleansing medallions'' possessed magical healing capabilities. When wielded by [[cleric]]s and [[paladins]] that worship powers of good, the amulet drew upon their faith and focused it into divine magical healing, on par with the ''[[cure light wounds]]'' [[spell]] once per day.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''cleansing medallions'' were sold by the [[Temple Pavilion]] in the city of [[Targos]], during the [[Legion of the Chimera]] crisis."
