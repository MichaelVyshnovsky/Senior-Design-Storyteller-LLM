Crossbows of the High Forest were enchanted light crossbows often credited to the Church of Mielikki.
Unlike many other enchanted +4 weapons, crossbows of the High Forest did not deal more damage instead, they greatly aided the weapons aim. Additionally, these weapons granted the wielder magical healing through minor regeneration.
Crossbows of the High Forest were created sometime before the late 14 century DR by the Underwood Company of the High Forest in northwest Faer√ªn. Since then, many confused the items for being of divine origin, owing to the powerful magics imbued into crossbows of the High Forest. In the late 14 century DR, most attributed the creation of these crossbows to the goddess Mielikki herself and could be found in several locations along the Sword Coast and in the city of Elventree in the Moonsea region.
