==Production & Trade==
{{Quote
|Everyone wants to make history, but few are willing to write it. Aurora's Catalogue therefore hails the downtrodden and ill-used class of scribes, and provides them the equipment they need to set history to paper.

}}
*[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] sold paper in various formats, from single sheets to [[book]]s. They made paper from trees of the [[High Forest]], after which they were bound in [[Waterdeep]] by the [[Scriveners, Scribes, and Clerk's Guild]]. [[Candlekeep]] were known to import books in large amounts from this catalogue.
*[[Serpentil Books & Folios]] in Waterdeep sold all kinds of ink and paper, including rare paper made from [[Sussur]] trees.{{Cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|6}}
*[[Ustiligator Paper Mill]] was a paper mill that produced white-woven paper that was highly valued among scribes and [[wizard]]s alike.

==Usages==

*The paper used for the [[Edu'sascar]] cards was made from [[flax]] and [[silk]] fibers, which was mixed with bamboo pulp, dried flowers of the [[dogwood]] tree, and a tuber known as [[tocara]]. It was rolled flat and cut using a holy blade kept in the [[S'tung Monastery]].

===Magic Items===
*''[[Paper of forms]]'' could be used to create origami creatures that would come alive after a [[command word]] was spoken. However, these origami creatures were very susceptible to [[fire]], like the paper they were made of.
*''[[Paper of writing]]'' magically transcribed the user's words and thoughts onto the paper.

===Spell Components===
Paper was a common [[spell component]] for [[spell]]s. 
*''[[Wind blast]]'' required a paper fan.
*''[[Instant regeneration]]'' used a piece of yellow paper.
*''[[Know school]]'' used a small tube of paper or [[vellum]].
*''[[Summon fire dragons]]'' required a strip of paper soaked with [[saltpeter]], [[coal]] [[oil]], and [[sulfur]].
*''[[Wall of paper]]'' used a piece of folded origami paper with a sliding joint.
*''[[Waterbane]]'' used some [[wax]] and paper.

Paper money was used in some places across the Realms, especially in ancient [[Kara-Tur]].

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Ito-jo]] of [[Kara-Tur]] was filled with paper creatures, such as [[paper mantis]]es and even the [[origami]]-master [[shukenja]] known as the [[Paper Warrior]]. If the Paper Warrior were to fall, he would crumple up into a ball, like a crunched piece of paper.

==Magic==
*The ''[[erase]]'' spell could remove magical or mundane writing from paper or a similar surface.
*The ''[[illusory script]]'' spell could imbue a writing surface with a magical command.
