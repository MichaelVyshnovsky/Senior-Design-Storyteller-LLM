The yuan was the second-lowest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur.
The yuan took the form of a copper coin with a hole through the center, similar to the fen. One yuan was worth 5 fen, 20 yuan were worth 1 chao or 1 tael, and 200 yuan were worth 1 chien.
Thanks to their holes, collections of fens and yuans were threaded on strings in amounts of 50â€“100, which was convenient for counting and carrying them. These cash strings could be worn on the wrist and tucked inside the sleeve.
