'''Chowder''' was a variety of thickened soup made with [[milk]] or [[cream]], that usually used [[fish]], [[corn]], or [[potato]]es

==Availability==
In the [[Sword Coast North]], hearty [[salt]]-laden chowder was a staple in the city of [[Luskan]], where it was served with strong [[ale]] in the dockside taverns. Similarly, chowders were a specialty of the [[Moonstone Mask]] of [[Neverwinter]]. Another variety of Waterdhavian chowder was [[coast chowder]], a seafood stew of heavy spices, found in [[The Red-Eyed Owl]].

Chowder was a common dish served in [[Phlan]] city of the [[Moonsea North]]. It was served with [[biscuit]]s and [[quail]] [[egg]]s.

Apart from aboard ships in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]],

In [[the Vast]], [[spice]]d chowder could be found on the menus of [[The Painted Boat]],{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Living City: The Painted Boat Restaurant|15}} [[Sword Tables Dining Lounge]], [[The Shark Fin]], and [[Embrol Sludge's Eatery & Shell Shoppe]] in [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite organized play/LC/The Case of the Missing Chef|4}} A remote town of [[Suiter's Hill]] in the Vast specialized on food made of [[Maztica]]n [[mayz]], including corn chowder.{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|10}}

In the northern frozen reaches of [[Icewind Dale]], chowder was eaten in the settlements of [[Termalaine]] and [[Caer-Dineval]] of the [[Ten Towns]]. [[The Uphill Climb]] tavern of Caer-Dineval sieved fish chowder, while [[The Blue Clam]] of Termalaine served spiced chowder. 

==History==
A simple recipe for [[potato chowder]] was recorded in the cook[[book]] titled ''[[Soups of the Realms]]'' by [[Brother Donnick]], the [[priest]] cook from the [[Open Hand Temple]] dedicated to [[Ilmater]] in [[Baldur's Gate]].
