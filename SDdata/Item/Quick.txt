Quick was a fine magical rapier used by Keph Thingoleir in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
With the command word Storms lash!, the weapon would be infused with lightning, causing increased damage to anything it slashed or impaled.
The weapon was commissioned as gift by the wizard Strasus Thingoleir and crafted by the master weaponsmith Mandel Oakhand in Iriaebor. A specially sourced sapphire from Amn was used in its construction.
It was wielded by Strasuss son Keph, who used it for both showboating and duels circa 1373 DR.
