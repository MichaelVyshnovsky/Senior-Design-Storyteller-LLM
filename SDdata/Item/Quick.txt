'''''Quick''''' was a fine [[magical]] [[rapier]] used by [[Keph Thingoleir]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
With the [[command word]] ''Storm's lash!'', the weapon would be infused with lightning, causing increased damage to anything it slashed or impaled.

==History==
The weapon was commissioned as gift by the [[wizard]] [[Strasus Thingoleir]] and crafted by the master weaponsmith [[Mandel Oakhand]] in [[Iriaebor]]. A specially sourced [[sapphire]] from [[Amn]] was used in its construction.

It was wielded by Strasus's son Keph, who used it for both showboating and duels ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].
