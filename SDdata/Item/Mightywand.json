        "mainbody": "A rod of many wands, mightywand, or gonne of many wands was a device capable of triggering a number of wands at the same time.\nUsually, a rod of many wands was a mace-like construction with a haft wrapped in leather. The far end was about twice as thick, with three depressions on which wands were to be mounted.\nA rod of many wands allowed the wands mounted on it to be activated as one with a long, complex Draconic invocation, at the cost of draining additional charges from all wands.\nThe War Wizard Belantra in Cormyr used a version that had a full half-dozen wands instead in the , on the night on which Elminster Aumar, the Chosen of Mystra, came to talk to Caladnei. Whatever those wands were, triggering three blasted apart the flagstones from under Elminsters feet, ripped up the ceiling, and generally raised a cloud of dust. One of the wands, whether it was triggered with the three or not, launched a green ray that melted flesh.\nElminster later claimed hed helped Vangerdahast enspell the device in use by Belantra, and it was annoying to see it wasted in a mightywand of the Lantanna fashion, strongly implying the device resembled a Lantanna gonne of many wands.\n* Belantra"
