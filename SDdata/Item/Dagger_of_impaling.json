        "mainbody": "'''''Daggers of impaling''''' were a variety of [[dagger]]s usable only by [[thieves]] that carried an [[enchantment]] that made extremely effective back-stabbing implements.{{Cite organized play/LC/Perfect Ten|12}}",
        "Powers": "In addition to carrying a ''+2'' enchantment, when stabbed into the back of an opponent a ''dagger of impaling'' would deal far more grievous wound than normal and would become lodged within the open gashing wound. Whilst impaled, a ''dagger of impaling'' continued to cause harm to the victim's bodily health until removed. This property made them useful as a throwing weapon.",
        "History": "Sometime around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[Ravenian]] [[adventurer]]s came across the corpse of a [[human]] man that had been killed with a ''dagger of impaling'' by members of the [[To Clan]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Perfect Ten|7}}\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, ''daggers of impaling'' gained some popularity among unsavory elements of [[Waterdeep]] and inhabitants of [[Undermountain]], including the recently resurfaced [[Shadow Thieves]] guild.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Misti Morgan]], a thief of the [[fence]] variety in Ravens Bluff, owned two ''daggers of impaling''.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Living City: Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop|16}}"
