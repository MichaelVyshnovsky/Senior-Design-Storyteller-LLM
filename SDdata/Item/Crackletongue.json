When the sword was drawn, blue flames ran along the blade.\nCrackletongue was a +5 saber of sharpness that could detect evil-aligned beings. When malevolent forces were nearby, the blue flames on the blade crackled. When the saber struck something evil, it emitted a snarl and showers of blue flame. It could slice through armor, muscle, and bone with ease."
