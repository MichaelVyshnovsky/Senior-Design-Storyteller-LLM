'''Bastard swords''' were a type of sword that fell in-between [[longsword]]s and [[greatsword]]s.

==Description==
Bastard swords had a longer grip than a one-handed sword and a shorter blade than a greatsword for extra precision in the strike. It was also more powerful than a ''longsword'' due to its increased weight.

==Weaponology==
Bastard swords were martial weapons normally used two-handed, but could also be wielded with just one. Though they required extra training to use effectively with a single hand.

==History==
Bastard swords first became available in the [[Netheril|Netheril Empire]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2254|NY}}.
