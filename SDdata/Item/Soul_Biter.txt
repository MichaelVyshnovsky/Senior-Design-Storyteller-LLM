'''''Soul Biter''''' was a mysterious enchanted [[short sword]] imbued with a sliver of [[nightshade]]'s power-draining ''negative energy''.

==Description==
''Soul Biter'' was a short and stout pitch-black blade that radiated [[Negative Energy plane]]'s magic.

==Powers==
''Soul Biter'' possessed the ''+2'' enchantment and was able to sap strength and life force out of its target upon a successful hit.

==History==
''Soul Biter'' was wielded by one of the [[skeleton lord]]s, part of the [[undead]] swarm unleashed in the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] of [[Myth Drannor]] during the [[Weeping War]]. The ''nightmare [[gate]]'' remained open until dispelled in [[1369 DR]] by the [[Veiled Ones]]. The blade's origin, as well as where the ''gate'' led remained undiscovered by the heroes from [[Phlan]].
