A '''''masthead of durability''''' was a type of enchanted [[wikipedia:Glossary_of_nautical_terms_(Mâ€“Z)#M|mast step]] that vastly improved the durability of any mast that was installed into it. They were primarily used in [[Realmspace]] among [[spelljammer]]s.<ref group="note" name="terminology">This item is a "masthead" in name only. A masthead is defined as being the top part of a mast, whilst this item is consistently described across sources as being the "lower support for a mast". The more appropriate term for such a structural component would be a "mast step", something that's located at the base of a mast and designed to support its weight and secure it to a deck.

==Description==
These small [[silver]] items were structural supports installed at the base of masts, physically bolting them to their decks.

==Powers==
Any mast that was equipped with a ''masthead of durability'' would be vastly strengthened, becoming virtually indestructible to physical attacks. Additionally, if a spelljammer were to ever attempt shearing off the top of a mast, the ship would suffer damage equivalent to its tonnage. However, they could not protect masts against destruction by fire.
