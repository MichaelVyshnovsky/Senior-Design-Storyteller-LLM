A '''''crown of stars''''' was a rare and possibly unique [[magic item]] that granted many wondrous powers.

==Description==
The crown was a collection of extremely valuable [[gem]]s that floated about the wearer's head. The gems were often mistaken for ''[[ioun stone]]s''. The light from these faintly glowing gems could not be masked by magical or normal means. The gems were bound by an invisible ring of power that could only be harmed by a ''[[disintegrate]]'' [[spell]] or a ''[[limited wish]]''.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ''crown of stars'' could use each of the following powers nine times per day: ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', and ''[[wizard eye]]''. The crown could also unleash a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' or ''[[death spell]]'' once per day, but using either of these powers permanently drained a randomly selected attribute from the wearer. There was also a small chance that the ''crown of stars'' would vanish and shift to another [[plane of existence]].

==History==
[[Ilrune Symbaern]], a [[baelnorn]] who inhabited [[Myth Drannor]], retrieved a ''crown of stars'' from some [[adventurer]]s he slew.
