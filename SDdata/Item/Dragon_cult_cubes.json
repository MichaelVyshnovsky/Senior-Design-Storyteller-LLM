        "mainbody": "ragon cult cubes was a set of two enchanted hellish dice.\nDragon cult cubes were six-sided dice said to have been carved out of Abyssal stone and tempered by the flames of Tiamat herself. Each side of the dice was inscribed with glowing Iokharic script.Out of all scripts in the Realms, these most closely resemble the Draconic language script Iokharic, which would make sense considering the Draconic nature of this item. However, the script doesnt exactly line up with any of the pre-established numbers of Iokharic.\nBelieved to hold a portion of Tiamats divine power, dragon cult cubes, when activated, imbued the user with dragons ire, granting them draconic strength.\n*Farideh, a warlock of Lorcan, who spent some time working with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR."
