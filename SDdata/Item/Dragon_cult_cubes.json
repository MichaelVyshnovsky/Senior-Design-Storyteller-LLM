        "Description": "''Dragon cult cubes'' were six-sided dice said to have been carved out of [[Abyss]]al stone and tempered by the flames of [[Tiamat]] herself. Each side of the dice was inscribed with glowing [[Iokharic]] script.Out of all scripts in the Realms, these most closely resemble the [[Draconic language]] script Iokharic, which would make sense considering the Draconic nature of this item. However, the script doesn't exactly line up with any of the pre-established numbers of Iokharic.",
        "Powers": "Believed to hold a portion of Tiamat's divine power, ''dragon cult cubes'', when activated, imbued the user with ''dragon's ire'', granting them draconic strength.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Farideh]], a [[warlock]] of [[Lorcan]], who spent some time working with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
