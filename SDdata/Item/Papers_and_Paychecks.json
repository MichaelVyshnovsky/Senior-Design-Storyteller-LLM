        "mainbody": "Papers and Paychecks was a role-playing game.\nIn it, players adopted the roles of students and workers in a fantasy world with a technological and industrialized society.

It seemed fun.\nKarl Chisolm, a thirteen-year-old boy of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, spent his spare time playing Papers and Paychecks with his friends."
