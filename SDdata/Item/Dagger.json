        "mainbody": "Daggers were short, two-sided blades used for stabbing and thrusting. They were not as long as a short sword, but were larger than a common knife.\nThe material used for daggers varied widely. Beyond metals, some common materials were bone and stone. In addition to these two materials, the people of Serôs were known to make daggers from coral.\nDaggers were easily thrown as improvised ranged weapons. They were excellent for use in an off-hand, for those who preferred dual-wielding melee weapons. And they were also occasionally used as implements by sorcerers.\n* Blades of Ochir Naal\n* Spider fang, an enchanted dagger that could both cut and weave webs.\n* Daggers were often considered favored weapons for a wide variety of deities. This included Deneir, Gargauth, Savras, Isis, Kiaransalee, Lolth, Abbathor, Fenmarel Mestarine, Baravar Cloakshadow, and Brandobaris.\n* Daggers were among the weapons widely used by the people of Serôs. They were often strengthed with enchantments so they could hold additional magic, with a common enchanment being free action. This particular enchantment allowed them to overcome the issues of water pressure and water resistance."
