The '''''Axe of the Phoenix''''' was the surprisingly light enchanted [[battleaxe]] that belonged to the [[dwarves]] of the [[House of Gems]] in [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
This double-bladed battleaxe was engraved with a beautiful image of a [[phoenix]].

==Powers==
The ''axe of the phoenix's'' main enchantment was its weight. For a big and intimidating two-handed weapon, this axe weighed almost nothing. Its engraved blades also carried a +2 enchantment was also made it much easier to hit the opponent.

==History==
In the days before the [[Weeping War]], this battleaxe served faithfully to [[Harldain Ironbar]]'s dwarven subordinates.

Long after the fall of Myth Drannor, in [[1369 DR]], the ''axe of the phoenix'' was stashed inside a chest in the House of Gems' entrance room guarded by one of the city's [[Iron golem|dwarven statue golems]].
