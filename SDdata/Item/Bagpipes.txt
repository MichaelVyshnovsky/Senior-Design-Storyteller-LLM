Bagpipes were a type of wind instrument that used a bag filled with the help of a mouthpiece to provide the necessary flow, while the sound came from the attached reed or reeds with different holes to vary the tone. Dwarves held bagpipes in high regard.

The Zakharan version of the bagpipes was called mizwid (meaning "food pouch" in Midani). It was played with a double-reeded flute attached to the wind bag with corresponding two rows of holes where the melody could be played, while it produced an underlying droning tone at the same time.
