'''Bagpipes''' were a type of wind instrument that used a bag filled with the help of a mouthpiece to provide the necessary flow, while the sound came from the attached reed or reeds with different holes to vary the tone.{{Cite dragon/202/Magic to a Different Beat}} [[Dwarves]] held bagpipes in high regard.

The [[Zakhara]]n version of the bagpipes was called '''''mizwid''''' (meaning "food pouch" in [[Midani]]). It was played with a double-reeded flute attached to the wind bag with corresponding two rows of holes where the melody could be played, while it produced an underlying droning tone at the same time.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}
