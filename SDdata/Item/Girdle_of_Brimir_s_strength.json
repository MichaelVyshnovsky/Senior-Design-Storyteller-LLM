        "mainbody": "The girdle of Brimirs strength was a unique variant of girdle of giant strength that was made by Brimir, as a gift to a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff.\nThis girdle was made from a strip of rawhide that Brimir had cut off his own giant-sized belt and had a crimson hue from being thoroughly stained with his blood. The girdles clasp was carved from the tooth of a bulette.  All along the girdles length, Giantish runes were carved into it.\nEnchanted with rune magic, the girdle of Brimirs strength gave its wearer tremendous strength, much like a standard girdle of giant strength. Where the belt differed in effect was causing the wearer to grow to a height of . These effects only lasted for up to four hours per day. After the effect was deactivated the wearer temporarily felt weaker than before and needed to rest for around twice the amount of time that the effect was active for.\nSometime around the 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff journeyed to Jotunheim in search of the legendary Well of Mimir so they could learn how to destroy a powerful githyanki artifact known only as the Great Machine.\nAccording to some sources they came to Brimirs hall as honored guests of his friend Habrok Icecaster, having proven their worth to him and his friends by hunting a bulette.\nIn eating they faced off against the fire giant Logi and had to reach the middle of a  trencher of stew. In drinking they faced no one, but had to drink alcohol from a massive horn as fast as they could. In running they faced the young giant Hugi and had to make it to the far end of the hall. Finally, in wrestling they faced Brimirs old mother Elli, as the giants felt any other competitor would make things unfair.\nSome claimed the adventurers managed to beat all four tests and for showing such prowess Brimir chose to give them an additional gift, creating the girdle of Brimirs strength."
