'''Death Cheese''' was a unique [[cheese]] that came from the swamps bordering both [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]]. It was sold through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' Its name had nothing to do with any dangers of eating the cheese, but rather the dangers of producing it.

==Description==
Death Cheese was a soft cheese that was rich in flavor. It was usually packed in a red paraffin rind, and was considered a delicacy on any dining room table.

==Production==
This cheese was made from [[catoblepas]] [[milk]]. Herds were kept by out-of-work adventurers who harvested the milk from the deadly creatures so the cheese could be produced. The [[Marsh Drover]]s of the [[Farsea Marshes]] were also known for producing the cheese, as well as the less well-known [[Deadeye Butter]], also made from catoblepas milk.

==Prices==
Death Cheese could be purchased from [[Aurora's Emporium]] and most other shops for 5 [[gp]] per {{SIAdj|1|lb}} loaf. It was much cheaper, however, to purchase the cheese directly from the Marsh Drovers at the marketplace in [[Eagle Peak]], where a loaf of the same size cost only 2 gp.

==Reputation==
The cheese's reputation included tales that the catoblepas milk was harvested by blind [[monk]]s who could locate the creatures purely by a sense of smell.

Death Cheese imported from [[Toril]] was one of the most popular items in [[Imel's Happy Tongue]], a [[tavern]] in [[Sigil]].

Death Cheese was one of the ingredients used in a [[foodomancy]] dish simply called ''[[basilisk and bread]]'' record in the ancient tome called the ''[[Manual of Culinary Delights]]''.{{Cite polyhedron/133/The Gentle Art of Foodomancy|21}}
