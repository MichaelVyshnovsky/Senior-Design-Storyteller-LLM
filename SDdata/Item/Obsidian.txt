Obsidian, also known as natural glass or volcanic glass, came in different grades and varieties, some more prized than others. Low grade obsidian, called pitchstone, was not as shiny or smooth as gem quality obsidian but was useful for grinding and abrading. A variety called blacksmoke obsidian was primarily found in Tashalar, sold in the local bazaars. A rare form of obsidian, called rainbow obsidian, was considered a semi-precious stone.
