The Great Oak was a name given to several sets of light armor enchanted by a treant named Birch.
The Great Oak possessed a +2 enchantment. When the wearer was battling giants, the Oak effectively became a +4 enchanted set of armor.
The Great Oak armors were created sometime before 1372 DR. A group of rogue giants uprooted several of the oldest oak trees in the grove under Birchs protection. Outraged and burning with revenge, Birch enlisted a group of rangers to stand against the giants. To help its new allies, the treant gathered all of its magical energy to enchant the suits of armor the rangers wore. Together, they defeated the giants and drove them back to the north. The tale of the encounter was still retold among the giants of the north Faer√ªn in the late 14 century DR.
By 1372 DR, the sets of enchanted armor, each known as The Great Oak, were scattered across the lands. One of these items was in possession of Ballard, a druid merchant from Port Llast on the Sword Coast.
In 1374 DR, another set of the Great Oak armor found its way into Hillsfar.
