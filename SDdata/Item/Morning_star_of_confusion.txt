'''''Morning stars of confusion''''' were [[enchanted]] bludgeons of unassuming appearance.

==Description==
The weapon consisted of a wooden shaft and a spiked [[gold]]en head. It was around {{SI|4'|'"|long=yes}} long. The golden head was magically hardened to avoid the metal's malleability.

==Powers==
These morning stars were enhanced with a ''+1'' enchantment that aided the wielder's hand, guiding it towards the target as well as improving the punishment dealt. Additionally, they had a chance of rendering the target creature confused and disoriented for a short period of time.

==History==
One ''morning star of confusion'' could be found in the top levels of the [[Dragon's Eye]] caverns on the [[Spine of the World]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1281}}.
