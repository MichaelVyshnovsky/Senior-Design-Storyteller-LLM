An '''armillary sphere''' was an astronomical model of the courses of the [[sun]], [[moon]]s, [[planet]]s, and [[star]]s and of the principle celestial circles.

==Description==
Usually made of [[bronze]], an armillary sphere held globes representing the sun or a planet such as [[Toril]], surrounding by rotating concentric rings that might be mounted with their own spheres representing other planets.

==Availability==
[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] sold an almost-flawless armillary sphere for 60 [[gp]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

A [[Netherese]] armillary sphere of similar quality was valued at 100 gp ''circa'' [[1479 DR]].

==Notable Armillary Spheres==
[[Moonmaiden's Hall]], a temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in her navigational aspect in [[Murann]], [[Amn]], possessed an intricate armillary sphere large enough to have an altar and a priest at the very center.<ref>

Another massive armillary sphere existed in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] under the city of [[Omu]] in [[Chult]]. This was large enough for people to sit inside the planets and operate it from within them, and on key conjunctions strange magical effects might occur.

==Notable Owners==
The retired [[mage]] [[Benelaius]] owned an armillary sphere at his home outside [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], ''circa'' [[1367 DR]]. He once had to move quickly to save after one of his [[cat]]s bumped it off a shelf.<ref>
