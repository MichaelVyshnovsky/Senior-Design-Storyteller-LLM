        "Description": "When drawn, purple lightning danced around the blade of these longswords, and around their hilts too.",
        "Powers": "''Storm-swords'' bore a powerful offensive enchantment, and could sunder almost any magical barrier on a strike; even a ''[[prismatic wall]]'' and related spells were pierced, one color at a time, per strike.\n\nEvery nine days, the weapon could be called upon to unleash a ''[[lightning bolt]]'' every minute for up to one hour, which swept a {{SIAdj|10|feet|long=yes|adj=wide}} area and stretched forward for {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}}. After the first lightning bolt was launched, the weapon could instead be used to teleport the wielder and up to one other creature they were touching, as per ''[[dimension door]]'', instead of lightning bolts, but that consumed the bolt for that minute. If there was a storm overhead, the bolt's potency was doubled.",
        "History": "''Storm-swords'' were mass-produced in [[Cormanthor]], yet they were borne only by heads of the Houses, war captains, and heirs. They were extremely expensive to create.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|241}}, three lords of Cormanthor—Lord [[Haladavar (Lord)|Haladavar]], Lord [[Urddusk (Lord)|Urddusk]], and Lord [[Malgath (Lord)|Malgath]]—drew their storm-swords to protest the Opening of Cormanthor during a meeting with [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]].{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|270-272|14}}",
