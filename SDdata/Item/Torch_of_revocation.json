        "mainbody": "'''''Torches of revocation''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] [[torch]]es that could also be used as [[mace]]s in battle, invented sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Torches of revocation'' burned with pale green supernatural flames. When used as a weapon, they possessed a meager ''+1'' enchantment to damage and guidance towards the target. Additionally, each attack with such a torch dealt additional [[necrotic]] damage and burned the targets with [[acid]]. Their main purpose, however, was in exorcism. The torches' flame destroyed anchors [[ghost]]s had on the [[Prime Material plane]], banishing them for good.",
        "History": "Sometime in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Oskar Fevras]], a painter from [[Baldur's Gate]], commissioned a ''torch of revocation'' from the [[Mystic Carrion]], the mysterious [[mummy lord]] who offered his magical aptitude to the rich and powerful inhabitants of the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] of the Gate. The torch may have been used to burn the artist's portrait, haunted by his past lover scorned."
