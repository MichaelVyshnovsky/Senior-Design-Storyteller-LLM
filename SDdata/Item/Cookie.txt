Cookies were small bite-sized sweet handfoods often available from taverns, bakeries, and street vendors across the Realms and favored by the sweet-toothed hin.
Cookies were usually baked in small clumps of dough or batter that spread and flattened whilst in the oven. They often were made with chocolate, oats, butterscotch, cinnamon, or just plain butter and sugar. During the baking process they could be cut into particular shapes using a molding tool that was referred to as a "cookie cutter".
