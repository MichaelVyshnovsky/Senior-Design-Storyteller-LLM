'''Cookies''' were small bite-sized sweet handfoods often available from taverns, bakeries, and street vendors across the Realms and favored by the sweet-toothed [[hin]].
{{quote|''In Al Qahara at the desert's edge, they make a concoction out of flour, [[chicken]]'s [[egg]]s, sugar, and [[cow]]’s butter, which they mix together into a sort of paste. Then they add small pieces of chocolate, which they bring on [[camel]]-back from ancient [[Okoth]]. They bake small circles of this paste on an ungreased pan. They call this a "cookie," I've been told. Because you cook it, I suppose. Things you boil, perhaps they are called "boilies" in that language.''|[[Gaspar-shen]]}}

==Description==
Cookies were usually baked in small clumps of dough or batter that spread and flattened whilst in the oven. They often were made with [[chocolate]], [[oats]], [[butterscotch]], [[cinnamon]], or just plain [[butter]] and [[sugar]]. During the baking process they could be cut into particular shapes using a [[mold (item)|molding]] tool that was referred to as a "cookie cutter".<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/How Long Can You Tread Water?|12,24}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Aethalynmur's Wings/Certificates}}
