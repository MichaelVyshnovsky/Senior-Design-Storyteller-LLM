Illydrael (), also called the Broken Blade,
The sword did not give off an aura that could be detected by magical means.
After it was shattered, the hilt and handle of Illydrael remained in the heart of the Hold of Battle Lions altar within Dragonspear Castle. 
When the handle was removed from the altar by a follower of Tempus, a blade of white flame erupted from the hilt. It exuded radiance and was extremely effected when used against devils.
During the Second Dragonspear war, in the , a champion of Tempus plunged Illydrael directly into the heart of the fiendish general Baazka.
Over a century later, in the , the rakshasa Nadir arranged for a group of vampires to dominate the cleric of Tempus, Darrondar Gweth. He had Gweth remove Illydrael from the altar and shed his own blood open the Dragonspear portal, with the intent of forcing his arch-rival Sir Isteval to sacrifice his soul to close it therafter.
