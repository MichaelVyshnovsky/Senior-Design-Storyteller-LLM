'''''Illydrael''''' ({{Pronounce|il|eh|DRAY|ul|refs=}}), also called '''the Broken Blade''',

==Description==
The sword did not give off an [[aura]] that could be detected by [[magic]]al means.

==Powers==
After it was shattered, the hilt and handle of ''Illydrael'' remained in the heart of the [[Hold of Battle Lions]] altar within Dragonspear Castle. 

When the handle was removed from the altar by a follower of Tempus, a blade of white flame erupted from the hilt. It exuded radiance and was extremely effected when used against [[devil]]s.

==History==
During the Second Dragonspear war, in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, a champion of Tempus plunged ''Illydrael'' directly into the heart of the fiendish general Baazka.

Over a century later, in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the [[rakshasa]] [[Nadir]] arranged for a group of [[vampire]]s to ''[[Dominate person|dominate]]'' the [[cleric]] of Tempus, [[Darrondar Gweth]]. He had Gweth remove ''Illydrael'' from the altar and shed his own blood open the Dragonspear ''portal'', with the intent of forcing his arch-rival [[Isteval|Sir Isteval]] to sacrifice his soul to close it therafter.
