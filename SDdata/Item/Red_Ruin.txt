The Red Ruin was a huge enchanted greataxe that once was wielded by the famous gladiator from Hillsfar Arena - Red Minotaur.
The Red Ruin was enchanted with a deadly +4 keen edge that dealt devastating slashing damage, significantly more dangerous than axes of similar size.
Before 1373 DR, the Red Ruin earned fame in the hands of the Red Minotaur, the gladiator Champion of Hillsfar in the Moonsea region. After the minotaur was defeated in battle by the Hero of Daggerford, the greataxe was taken from the Red Minotaur by an unknown person and sold for a hefty sum of coins. Later, the magic weapon ended up in the hands of Zhentarim agents stationed in Iyrauroths swamps of Thar.
