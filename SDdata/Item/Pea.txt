'''Pea''' was a variety of edible legume grown on delicate vine plants with white flowers, harvested from elongated pods and used for food by [[humanoid]]s and [[centaur]]s, among other creatures of the [[Realms]].{{Cite dragon/103/The Centaur Papers|37}} Several species of peas existed, including '''split''',{{Cite organized play/LC/In the Halls of the Mountain Mage|10}} '''green'''

==Availability==
In the [[Waterdhavian]] [[Bowels of the Earth]] tavern, peas were served stewed in a thick concoction of [[lentil]]s, fat, bones, and meat scraps. In the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] and the [[Chionthar Valley]], [[roast beef]] joint dish was garnished with peas. Split pea soup, in the style of the Dalelands, was flavored with smoked [[ham]] and sprinkled with a generous amount of [[pepper]], commonly served in the region's eateries.

In the Forest Kingdom of [[Cormyr]], peas were cultivated in the town of [[Immersea]]. West of Cormyr, peas were grown in a small village of stone huts in the [[Veilstone Peaks]] – [[Bedford]], where such crops as peas and [[potato]]es could grow in rocky terrain.

In [[Calimshan]] and the [[Calim Empire]], peas were among common dried ration foods, alongside [[fig]]s, [[prune]]s, flat [[bread]], [[date]]s, and [[goat cheese]].

In the [[Vast]], least were a product of the [[Cottswald]] family, gown in the fields by the family's manor outside of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|14}}


Further northeast, [[barley]] and peas were grown in abundance in [[Ra-Khati]] country in the [[Hordelands]]. And in the [[Utter East]], peas were cultivated in the hidden country of [[Langdarma]] within the [[Yehimal Mountains]].

On the [[Zakhara]]n continents, peas could be found stored in the granaries and kitchens of [[Sarahin]] in the [[Haunted Lands]].

==Usage==
The [[Savage Frontier]], and the lands just south of [[Neverwinter]] served a staple [[pea soup]], scooped into cut open [[bread]] loaves.

In the [[Dalelands]] and in [[Shadowdale]], peas were commonly eaten with [[venison]] and potatoes – a strange combination for people of [[Turmish]].

Peas were commonly dried for storage and to be consumed. Dried peas were also used by many [[thieves]] to scatter in front of pursuers like marbles or ball bearings. This practice went as far back as the ancient [[Athalantar]]. Dried peas in the north were exported out of Calimshan and [[Tashalar]].

[[Trick lock]]s – carved wooden balls used by [[gnome]]s and [[dwarves]], hid hollow compartments filled with dried peas or metal [[chimes]], allowing the items to rattle making them good toys for the children.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210803164924/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Apr – Jun 2006| accessdate = 10-28-2021| date = 5-16-2006}}


In magic, dried peas were used as a [[spell component]] to cast the ''[[fog cloud]]'' [[spell]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Spell of Bad Weather|15}} Powdered dried peas, in turn, were used to cast the ''[[solid fog]]'', ''[[death fog]]'',{{Cite dragon/66/New Spells for Illusionists|25-26}} and ''[[wall of fog]]'' spells. [[Priest]]s of [[Lliira]] could conjure the ''[[triple mask]]'' spell with three peas as the material components.
