        "mainbody": "'''Dark naga poison''' or '''dark naga venom''' was a substance extracted from the venomous tail barb of a [[dark naga]].",
        "Description": "The venom of a dark naga was a thick black viscous fluid that could be extracted from the naga's tail after its death or be voluntarily secreted by the serpentine creature itself. When a dark naga was in combat, its tail dripped with the dangerous substance.",
        "Effects": "Even though dangerous, dark naga poison was not deadly. When injected or introduced into a victim's bloodstream via the naga's tail or poisoned weapon, they fell into a deep, drugged slumber that could last between two and eight minutes. Even after the poison wore off, it left the victim slightly unsteady and groggy, but that effect usually cleared within fifteen minutes.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], a vial of dark naga poison was used to enchant a magical shield called ''[[Nightshade (shield)|Nightshade]]'', deep within the [[Elven Catacombs]] of [[Myth Drannor]]."
