        "mainbody": "A '''life preserver''' was a ring-shaped flotation device used to rescue people that fell overboard on a ship, either in water or in [[Wildspace]].",
        "Usage": "Using a life preserver required having a [[rope]] tied to it before throwing it out to an overboard individual so that they could be pulled back towards the ship. On surface worlds, life preservers helped to prevent people from drowning. In Wildspace, life preservers were meant to be thrown out into a [[spelljammer]]'s [[gravity plane]], wherein they would bob up and down across the plane until they came to rest on the gravity plane or was caught by the crew member that had fallen overboard.",
