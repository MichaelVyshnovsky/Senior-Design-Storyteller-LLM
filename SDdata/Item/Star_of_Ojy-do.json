        "mainbody": "A '''''star of Ojy-do''''' was a magical [[shuriken]] forged by [[Ojy]] of [[Golden]] in [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].<ref group=\"note\">Magical shuriken called ''stars of Ojy-do'' first appeared in the ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' game, then its sequel ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]''. Although the games are primarily set in [[northwest Faerûn]], it is not known where the village of Golden lies. In ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'', [[Ojy-do]] is in fact a city in Koryo, and the [[Fangs of Night]] [[ninja]] there are known for the ''[[Throwing Stars of Ojy-do]]'', but these have very different powers. The item in ''Neverwinter Night'' is likely based loosely on this. Given the similarity and oriental theme, this article assumes that Golden lies in Koryo near Ojy-do.",
        "Description": "Two distinct versions of the ''stars of Ojy-do'' were recorded; one three hooked blades around a circular center and the other had four blades joined at the center.",
        "Powers": "These weapons were ''+1 shuriken'' that inflicted freezing cold on their targets.",
        "History": "When bandits besieged the village of Golden, the villagers were forced to defend themselves. The spiritual guide Ojy was pressed into work as a weaponsmith, though he knew little of metalworking. With every accurate strike of his hammer, he thanked his guiding spirits, and so the ''stars of Ojy-do'' were forged from the strength of his faith. They proved just as resilient.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], ''stars of Ojy-do'' circulated around the [[northwest Faerûn]] and the [[Sword Coast North]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Stars of Ojy-do'' were available for purchase from [[Okuzo's Imports]] of [[Westgate]], along with numerous magical items exported from the eastern realms by the immigrant shop owner."
