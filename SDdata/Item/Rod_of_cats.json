        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of cats''''' was a magical [[rod]] that granted powers associated with felines and thievery.",
        "Description": "It was a black wooden staff 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length, with a carved [[cat]]'s head on a knob at one end.",
        "Powers": "It could be wielded as a ''+1 [[quarterstaff]]''. When held, the ''rod of cats'' greatly improved the wielder's ability to climb, hide, move stealthily, and see in low light conditions.\n\nOnce per day, the wielder could use the rod to cast ''[[darkness]]'', but only upon the rod. Anyone holding the ''rod of cats'' was immune to this spell's effects.\n\nThere was a hidden compartment in the rod but it was only large enough to hold a [[scroll]] or some [[thieves' tools]].",
        "Creation": "Creation of this rod required the spells ''[[cat's grace]]'', ''darkness'', ''[[darkvision]]'', and ''[[spider climb]]''.",
        "Cost": "The rod was worth 25,000 [[gold piece]]s."
