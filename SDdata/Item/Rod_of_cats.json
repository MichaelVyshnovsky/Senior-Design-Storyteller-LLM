        "mainbody": "A rod of cats was a magical rod that granted powers associated with felines and thievery.\nIt was a black wooden staff 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length, with a carved cats head on a knob at one end.\nIt could be wielded as a +1 quarterstaff. When held, the rod of cats greatly improved the wielders ability to climb, hide, move stealthily, and see in low light conditions.\nOnce per day, the wielder could use the rod to cast darkness, but only upon the rod. Anyone holding the rod of cats was immune to this spells effects.\nThere was a hidden compartment in the rod but it was only large enough to hold a scroll or some thieves tools.\nCreation of this rod required the spells cats grace, darkness, darkvision, and spider climb.\nThe rod was worth 25,000 gold pieces."
