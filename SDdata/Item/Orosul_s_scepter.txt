'''''Orosul's scepters''''' were [[Netherese]] power [[:Category:scepters|scepters]] capable of healing wounds and charging depleted [[magic item]]s.

==Description==
''Orosul's scepters'' were metal bars around {{SI|8|inch|long=true|c}} in length, terminated by small metal balls faceted like gems. Each scepter could be split in two, and the halves could subsequently be fused together again by having them touch each other.

==Powers==
Complete scepters had several magic properties:
* They could recharge depleted magic items when staying in contact with them for several hours.
* They could heal wounds or regrow missing limbs when touching a creature for long enough. Healing simple wounds could take a couple of hours, whereas regrowing limbs could take up to a [[tenday]].
* Scepters could release offensive [[magic]] blasts, usually using fire or lightning [[:Category:elements|elements]]. Different scepters could produce different blasts, and the only way to determine the power of a specific scepter was to use it.

When split, both halves of a scepter had limited powers, which allowed them to be made whole again:
* The half-scepter would glow with a blue-green hue when within {{SI|1|mile|long=true|k}} of its matching half.
* The metal ball would glow with a red hue when touching items or brought into areas bearing a [[dweomer]].

==History==
Because their original name was lost to the ages, these scepters were named after [[Orosul]], a wizard who owned half a scepter and extensively studied it during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Rumors==
A half of a scepter was said to be hidden under a cobblestone in [[Archenbridge]], within sight of [[Orosul's Tower]]. The other half was for a time in possession of the [[dracolich]] [[Rauglothgor]], before being brought to [[Zhentil Keep]].
