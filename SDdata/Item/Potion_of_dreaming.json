        "Powers": "The imbiber of this potion experienced a vision of something that they desired. After consuming the potion, the imbiber named something that they wished to learn more about. When they went to sleep, they had a dream that revealed one fact about the named object, including the object's location, dangers regarding the object, etc.\n\nEach potion allowed for one dream. Upon waking, the imbiber vividly remembered the information garnered from the dream.",
