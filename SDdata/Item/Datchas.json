        "Description": "Datchas could be found in small stones, which were typically cut into [[wikipedia:facet|faceted]] [[gem]]s, or large warty [[wikipedia:nodule|nodules]] up to {{SI|10|in|long=yes}} in diameter which were either sliced and polished for use as inlays or cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]]. The pale yellowish green hue was the most prized for faceted gems; the orange hue was in highest demand for inlays. Other colors, caused by impurities of copper and other minerals, were white to pink to red, and reddish brown. A typical faceted stone had a base value of 50 gp.",

        "Notable Users": "* [[Lolth]] sometimes showed her favor to followers by having them discover datchas that had [[spider]]s encased in them."
