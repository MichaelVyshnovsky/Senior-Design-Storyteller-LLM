'''''Armor of the Wolf''''' was a type of [[light armor]] created out of a simple [[wolf]] hide and [[enchanted]] using the animal's spirit.

==Powers==
These sets of armor were crafted and enchanted by the most masterful artisans of the Realms. Unlike regular wolf [[hide armor]] that offered little protection, ''armor of the Wolf'' held a ''+3'' enchantment. When imbued with the animal spirit, these armors gained enchantments that improved the wearer's ability to move silently and granted them potent protection against [[shapechanger]]s' attacks, including [[lycanthrope]]s, [[doppelganger]], and many other dangerous monsters.

==History==
Historically, ''armors of the Wolf'' were prized among the many beast-worshiping cults across the lands. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several sets of these hides could be found in the [[Sword Coast]] region and in the city of [[Hillsfar]], [[Moonsea]].
