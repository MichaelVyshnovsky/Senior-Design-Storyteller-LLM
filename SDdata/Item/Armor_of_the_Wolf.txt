Armor of the Wolf was a type of light armor created out of a simple wolf hide and enchanted using the animals spirit.
These sets of armor were crafted and enchanted by the most masterful artisans of the Realms. Unlike regular wolf hide armor that offered little protection, armor of the Wolf held a +3 enchantment. When imbued with the animal spirit, these armors gained enchantments that improved the wearers ability to move silently and granted them potent protection against shapechangers attacks, including lycanthropes, doppelganger, and many other dangerous monsters.
Historically, armors of the Wolf were prized among the many beast-worshiping cults across the lands. By the late 14 century DR, several sets of these hides could be found in the Sword Coast region and in the city of Hillsfar, Moonsea.
