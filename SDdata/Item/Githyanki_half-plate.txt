Githyanki half-plate armor was the variety of half plate mail worn by githyanki soldiers and raiders.
Each set of armor was said to had been forged under the strict guidance of githyanki smiths, according to exact specifications set out by the Undying Queen Vlaakith CLVII herself.
It was difficult for an individual wearing this armor to move in a stealthy manner.
The githyanki developed an enchanted version of this armor called psionic ward armor, used to protect their warriors from the psionic powers of illithids.
