        "mainbody": "The '''''Seal of Iron''''' was a powerful [[magical item]] created by the [[Obarskyr]] dynasty. It was part of the set of magical items known as the ''[[Four from Cormyr (item set)|Four from Cormyr]]'', along with ''[[Silveredge]]'', ''[[Deathsend]]'', and ''[[Fireblood]]''.",
        "Description": "The ''Seal'' was a two-inch bronze disk engraved with the seal of the [[Obarskyr]] family.",
        "Powers": "The ''Seal of Iron'' gave its wearer complete immunity to all types of fear, with the name describing the wearer's mettle rather than the disk's material. It was intended to be used as part of the ''Four from Cormyr'', by being slotted into the scabbard of the [[bastard sword]] ''Silveredge''.",
        "History": "The ''Seal of Iron'' was the property of the Obarskyr family, and was traditionally held by them. In [[1369 DR]], it was gifted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] to the [[adventurer]]s who had rescued him from the [[Emerald Swords]]. The adventurers then went on to join it with the other ''Four from Cormyr''."
