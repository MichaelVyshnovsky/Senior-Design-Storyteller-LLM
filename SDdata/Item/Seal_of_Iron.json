        "mainbody": "he Seal of Iron was a powerful magical item created by the Obarskyr dynasty. It was part of the set of magical items known as the Four from Cormyr, along with Silveredge, Deathsend, and Fireblood.\nThe Seal was a two-inch bronze disk engraved with the seal of the Obarskyr family.\nThe Seal of Iron gave its wearer complete immunity to all types of fear, with the name describing the wearers mettle rather than the disks material. It was intended to be used as part of the Four from Cormyr, by being slotted into the scabbard of the bastard sword Silveredge.\nThe Seal of Iron was the property of the Obarskyr family, and was traditionally held by them. In 1369 DR, it was gifted by Lord Partic Thistle to the adventurers who had rescued him from the Emerald Swords. The adventurers then went on to join it with the other Four from Cormyr."
