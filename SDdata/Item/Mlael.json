        "mainbody": "Mlael was a spicy vegetable gravy popular in Delzimmer. Occasionally strong alcohol was added, either secretly or for bragging rights, so mlael could be just as intoxicating as some beverages.\nMlael was made by boiling herbs, spices, and chopped edible roots in water. It could be left to simmer for days, adding other ingredients as they became available. The primary roots and vegetables used in preparing mlael were surt and chasstil respectively, both of which were cut into small pieces. The final result was a brown, lumpy, and very thick liquid, typically ladled over most any meal."
