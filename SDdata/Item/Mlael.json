Occasionally strong alcohol was added, either secretly or for bragging rights, so mlael could be just as intoxicating as some beverages.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|49}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 41: Delzemaeran Delicacies, Part 3}}",
        "Description": "Mlael was made by boiling [[herbs]], [[spices]], and chopped edible roots in water. It could be left to simmer for days, adding other ingredients as they became available. The primary roots and vegetables used in preparing mlael were [[surt]] and [[chasstil]] respectively, both of which were cut into small pieces. The final result was a brown, lumpy, and very thick liquid, typically ladled over most any meal.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|46}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 38: Life in Delzimmer}}"
