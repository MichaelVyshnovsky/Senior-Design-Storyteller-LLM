        "mainbody": "The Ruby of Chissentra was a large magical scrying gem bestowed upon the traitor-priestess Shakti Hunzrin by Vhaeraun.\nThe gem was linked to a ruby bowl engraved with runes. The gem could not function unless it had a host. In order to function, the gem had to be pressed against someones forehead, causing searing pain as it burned into their flesh. The gem would then work as a third eye for the wielder of the ruby bowl, who would be able not only to see through the gem, but also to mentally speak to the bearer and also to inflict excruciating psychic pain, which could reach lethal levels.\nLiriel finally destroyed the stone during the confrontation between the drow and the Rashemi when she cast a spell demanding a large gem as a material component. As a result of the spell, Brindlor, the latest bearer of the stone, had the stone removed from his forehead and burst in an explosion of gore.\nNisstyre was the first bearer of the ruby. When Shakti boasted the favor of Vhaeraun, she enlisted his help, searing the stone into his forehead in her plot to kill Liriel Baenre. He wore it until his death in his magical duel against Liriel.\nThe last bearer of the stone was Brindlor Zidorion, recruited by Gorlist in order to murder Liriel. He put the stone onto his forehead at Shaktis behest."
