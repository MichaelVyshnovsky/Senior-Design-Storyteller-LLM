        "mainbody": "The '''''Ruby of Chissentra''''' was a large magical [[scrying]] [[gem]] bestowed upon the traitor-priestess [[Shakti Hunzrin]] by [[Vhaeraun]].",
        "Powers": "The gem was linked to a [[ruby]] bowl engraved with runes. The gem could not function unless it had a host. In order to function, the gem had to be pressed against someone's forehead, causing searing pain as it burned into their flesh. The gem would then work as a third eye for the wielder of the ruby bowl, who would be able not only to see through the gem, but also to mentally speak to the bearer and also to inflict excruciating psychic pain, which could reach lethal levels.\n{{Quote|\"A third eye,\" she explained. \"The ruby is attuned to a scrying bowl that will enable me to see whatever you see, even in the Night Above.\"|Shakti Hunzrin}}\n\nLiriel finally destroyed the stone during the confrontation between the drow and the [[Rashemi]] when she cast a spell demanding a large gem as a [[material component]]. As a result of the spell, [[Brindlor Zidorion|Brindlor]], the latest bearer of the stone, had the stone removed from his forehead and burst in an explosion of gore.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Nisstyre]] was the first bearer of the ruby. When Shakti boasted the favor of Vhaeraun, she enlisted his help, searing the stone into his forehead in her plot to kill [[Liriel Baenre]]. He wore it until his death in his magical duel against Liriel.\n\nThe last bearer of the stone was [[Brindlor Zidorion]], recruited by [[Gorlist]] in order to murder Liriel. He put the stone onto his forehead at Shakti's behest."
