'''''Anchoring''''' was a magical enchantment applied to [[armor]] and [[shield]]s that allowed the wearer, or bearer, to stand their ground more firmly. They would be incredibly difficult to move their position during battle. 

==Creation==
To apply the ''anchoring'' effect to a shield or suit of armor, the magical craftsperson used the spell ''[[bull's strength]]''.
