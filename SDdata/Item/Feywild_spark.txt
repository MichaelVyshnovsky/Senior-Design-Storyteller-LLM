A '''''feywild spark''''' was a mote of life energy that originated from the plane of the [[Feywild]].

==Description==
Each spark was the physical manifestation of pure ''feywild energy''.

==Origins==
It was possible to create ''feywild sparks'' by placing ''[[feydark crystal]]s'' within the ''purifying pool'' of the [[Arcane Reservoir]] in [[New Sharandar]]. 

==Usage==
It was possible to gather a number of these motes together and use them for your own personal ends through the Feywild.
