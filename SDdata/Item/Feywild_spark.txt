A feywild spark was a mote of life energy that originated from the plane of the Feywild.
Each spark was the physical manifestation of pure feywild energy.
It was possible to create feywild sparks by placing feydark crystals within the purifying pool of the Arcane Reservoir in New Sharandar. 
It was possible to gather a number of these motes together and use them for your own personal ends through the Feywild.
