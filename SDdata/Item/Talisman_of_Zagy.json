        "mainbody": "talisman of Zagy was an unusual magical item that responded powerfully to the bearers personal charisma.\nA talisman of Zagy had the same appearance as a stone of controlling earth elementals, looking like an innocuous chunk of polished rock.\nA talisman of Zagy responded to whoever touched it, determining a hostile, neutral, or friendly reaction to their innate charisma.\n* A hostile talisman acted as if it were a stone of weight, drastically slowing down the bearer when they tried to move quickly. Fortunately, the talisman was not as hard to get rid of, and destroying it permanently removed it from the bearer.\n* A neutral talisman would simply remain with the bearer for a day or two, then mysteriously disappear.\n* A friendly talisman would cling to the bearer for months or years depending on just how charismatic they were. In this time, it could grant the bearer multiple wishes, and give off a throbbing warmth whenever the bearer came within 20 feet of a magical or mechanical trap.\nWhatever reaction the talisman had, at the moment of disappearance it would replace itself with a diamond worth 10,000 gp.\n* A gang of imps in the Vast Swamp had a small treasure hoard, including a talisman.\n* The shadow dragon Shadowdeath, who was trapped inside the Tower of Ruin, had a sizable hoard including a talisman."
