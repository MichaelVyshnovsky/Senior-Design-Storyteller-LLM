The wreath of flame was a potent enchanted circlet that could inflict both injury and weakness onto any who met the wearers gaze. It could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.
This headpiece was made of hammered yet very reflective gold.
The wreath of flame allowed the wearer to cast eyebite, and activating the wreath caused the wearers eyes to turn black.
