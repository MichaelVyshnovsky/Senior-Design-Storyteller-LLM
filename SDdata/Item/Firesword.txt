Firesword was a common ale originally brewed in Hillsfar, YÃ»lash, and Zhentil Keep. By the late 14 century DR, the drink spread across the lands on the shores of the Moonsea and the Dragon Reach.
Firesword was an amber ale and was more of a type of a drink rather than a named product as it was widely brewed by many establishments, all using similar recipes. Because of that, Firesword one would buy in Hillsfar could taste distinct from Firesword served in Ravens Bluff. The drink was considered to be an "inn standard" for its longevity and ease of transportation once packaged and sealed in kegs. Many establishments "revived" stale Firesword with honey.
