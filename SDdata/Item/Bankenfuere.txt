Bankenfuere was Berkthgar the Bolds large flamberge sword. 
The sword had a wavy 4-ft-long (1.2 m) blade with an 8-in-long (0.2 m) ricasso before the hilt and cross guard. Berkthgar carried his weapon in a shoulder sheath on his back.
Around 1358 DR, Berkthgar fought the famed Companion of the Hall Catti-brie with Bankenfuere in Settlestone to settle a disagreement Berkthgar had with Bruenor Battlehammer over Wulfgars warhammer, Aegis-fang.
After the battle, Berkthgar declared he would make a new legend of his sword, Bankenfuere the Northern Fury. Catti-brie called the sword "Cow-killer".
