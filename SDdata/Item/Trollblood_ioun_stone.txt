The '''''Trollblood ioun stone''''' was a unique ''[[ioun stone]]'' giving martial prowess against [[troll]]s and the ability to regenerate wounds.

==Description==
The stone was a gleaming dark green, resembling a sphere of hardened troll blood, bearing deep cracks.

==Powers==
When attuned, the ''Trollblood ioun stone'' granted its bearer great skill in slaying trolls in combat and conferred a weaker form of a troll's ability to regenerate wounds.

==History==
According to legend, seven trolls had once been captured and, over seven nights, used in experiments in [[magic]]. From the blood of each of the seven trolls, the ''Trollblood ioun stone'' was created.

The stone came into the possession of the [[vampire]] [[Tsolak]]. When in the forest by the [[Coast Way]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in [[1368 DR]], Tsolak would give the stone in reward to any who killed the vampire hunters [[Ikros]] and [[Isabella]].
