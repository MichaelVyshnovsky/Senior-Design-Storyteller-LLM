        "History": "Many of the ''amulets of natural armor'' that were circulating around the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] came from [[Telenn]], a retired [[warrior]]. When Telenn's old age caught up with him, he pivoted his career towards instructing local youth, aspiring adventurers in the art of combat. During that time, he  rekindled his old hobbyâ€”the arcane arts. As he improved his magical skills, he started crafting these amulets for the students, to prevent them injuring each-other. Some time later, when he perfected his ''amulets of natural armor'' he decided to return to adventuring aided by his amulets.\n\nAn older recipe came from the [[Imaskarran Tome of Ice]], which called for [[quartz]] and a [[skeleton]]'s knuckle, enchanted with [[mage armor]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Telenn]], an aging adventurer who developed his own crafting recipe for the ''amulets of natural armor''.\n* [[Handragath]], a [[human]] [[wizard]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], active ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].\n* [[Presto]], a human wizard who originated from [[Earth]].<ref>"
