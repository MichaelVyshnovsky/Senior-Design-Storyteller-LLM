A '''rogue stone''' (sometimes written '''roguestone''') was a small, extremely rare magical gemstone{{Cite dragon/116/Rogue Stones and Gemjumping|54}} with a tendency to cause [[wild magic]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-04-16 - Rogue stones}}

==Description==
Varied in overall outer hue but always chatoyant, rogue stones were filled with rainbow colors that flowed as if in liquid, slowly swirling iridescently, when exposed to sunlight. Rogue stones were easily faceted along natural planes and the resulting faces gave the stones their iridescent property. 

One rogue stone, belonging to [[Elminster]], was large and blue. Another stone, known to have been in Elminster's possession at some point, was instead a dime-sized, or {{SI|0.71|inch|m|long=yes}}, faceted, and displaying shifting colors.Canadian dimes are assumed. As of 1986, the time of writing, the canadian dime specification for freshly minted dimes was of 18.03 millimeters. Another stone, once in possession of [[Shandril Shessair]], was teardrop-shaped, smooth, sparkling and iridescent, with swirling colors within. One last stone, enspelled by the mage [[Kordeerlar]], resembled a chatoyant ruby.{{Cite dragon/164/Treasures that lead to adventures|81}} Another rogue stone, possessed by [[Dove Falconhand]], was green.{{cite book/Hall of Heroes|111}}

==Properties==
On the inside, rogue stones contained cavities filled with an oily mineral on which partially iridescent particles were suspended. These free-floating particles were responsible for the flowing colors within the rogue stones. Though their exact origin was unknown, they were formed in much the same way as other gemstones.

A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp but was likely to be worth much more to wizards who knew of its uses. There were more than sixty known rogue stones throughout the Realms.

Single stones have been found in treasure hoards, cold regions, and sunk in swamps, but evidence about what type of rock they occurred in was inconclusive. They were extremely rare and seemed to repel each other: no two rogue stones were ever found in the same place at the same time.

==Powers==
Rogue stones were used to cast the ''[[gemjump]]'' spell. Rogue stones did not have a detectable magic aura, except at the time the ''gemjump'' spell was being cast, and they were not destroyed or consumed by the initial enchantment or the activation of the spell.

The presence of a rogue stone within 20 ft (6.1 m) of a spell effect (either near the caster or the target, if any) increased the chances of that magic going wild or failing. At the recipient end, it decreased the chances of the target resisting or overcoming the magic effect, if applicable. If a rogue stone was used in the construction of a wand that produced a [[:Category:Chaotic spells|chaotic]] or [[:Category:Teleportation spells|teleportation]] effect, it increased the efficacy of that effect by either making it more difficult to resist or by increasing the level at which the effect was cast.

==History==
Rogue stones and ''gemjumping'' have played a role in several dramatic events in the history of the Realms.
* [[Durlyn]], the court mage of [[Brammas]], Lord of [[Sulmarin]], mounted a rogue stone on the regent's crown so he could appear before his liege in times of emergency. This served him well when thieves made off with the crown to their cavern hideaway. Durlyn ''gemjumped'' to the crown and vanquished the thieves by surprise and magic.
* [[Faeros]], a rogue mage, sold a rogue stone to an agent of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. After waiting a sufficient interval for the stone to make its way into the secret rooms of their Citadel, he ''gemjumped'' in, gathered up the rogue stone and all the spell books he found, and ''[[fly|flew]]'' away.{{Cite dragon/116/Rogue Stones and Gemjumping|55}}
* [[Glemmora]] of the [[Rallyhorn]]s cleverly hid a rogue stone and a spare spell book in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] and used ''gemjump'' to escape King [[Urgiathus]] of [[Dulgund]] where he had shackled her in the [[Dungeons of Torment]].
* [[Gulthas]], the Black Mage, attempted to loot the hoard of [[Tiamat]] herself when she made her lair on the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]] known as [[Avernus]]. When discovered and pursued by three of her consorts, he ''gemjumped'' to the safety of his fortress on the [[Sword Coast]] near [[Baldur's Gate]].
* [[Heladar]] of [[Procampur]] sent a rogue stone as a gift to Princess [[Lustra]], Royal Lady of [[Innarlith]]. One night he ''gemjumped'' into her boudoir and used ''[[sleep]]'' on her terrified handmaidens. He was able to spend the entire night wooing the sheltered princess before he was discovered. Thus began a passionate courtship, and they eventually married.
* [[Laeral Silverhand]] once had a belt to which two rogue stones were affixed. One was attuned to [[Khelben Arunsun]] and the other to [[Alduth]] of [[Neverwinter]]. When she found the amulet belonging to the [[demon lord]] [[Arlgolcheir]], she used sending spells to alert her allies, they ''gemjumped'' to her aid, and the trio summoned and defeated the demon.
* [[Mercloak]] of [[Ruathym (city)|Ruathym]] was able to exert his will after centuries of ''[[imprisonment]]'' in solid rock and escape his tomb. He appeared before his jailer, the wizard [[Ranthal]] of [[Berdusk]], who had in the meantime become a [[lich]], and obliterated him. He then proceeded to explore the Realms, much different from the Realms of his day, and revel in its pleasures. It was said he eventually returned to the spot of his enemy's defeat and spoke thanks to the truly dead mage for his trip through time to a greatly improved world.
* Dove Falconhand carried a rogue stone enspelled to take her to [[Evermeet]] if she needed it.

At some point, the wizard [[Elminster]] gave a rogue stone to [[the Simbul]] which had the power to summon him.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some primitive [[human]]s believed rogue stones to be sentient and contained the conscious part of dragons or fabled heroes. Most sages agreed this view was strictly folklore.
