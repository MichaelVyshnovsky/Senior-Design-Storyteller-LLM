Though it was clear enough to see through, by Tarsakh 17 of the , the Keystone more closely resembled amethyst, maybe because of a hazy darkness that had been growing inside it, making the crystal no longer clear enough to see through.While it may have been a simple change of color, the crystal that Ususi found for sale in Two Stars is stated to be both purple like an amethyst and resembling her Keystone. Thus, this article assumes that its precise hue resembles that of blue-black amber, which could be mistaken for amethyst. Or, again, it may have indeed been a change of color.\nBefore 1373 DR, the druid Briartan used the Keystone to control the portals in the Mucklestones standing stone circle the Talontar blightlord Gameliel took the stone from him in order to use the same power. Even after using it for a short time, Ususi became sensitive to the paths piercing the Nadir. The Nentyar hunter Fallon employed the Keystone in order to allow the external influence of the Talontar blightlord Anammelech into the Nadir. After recovering the Keystone from Anammelech, Ususi also used the hole in the keystone to peer for leftover seams due to teleportation spells, and employed its power over extradimensional spaces and transport to follow Damandas teleportation with one of her own, despite not knowing the end location. Finally, she was able to use it to initiate a teleportation of her own, taking her a short distance away.\nIn 1374 DR, Ususi carried the Keystone with her while exploring several Imaskari ruins across the Unapproachable East along the way to Vaelan, looking for new entrances into the Celestial Nadir. as it believed the artifact had the power to fully open Pandoryms prison within the Imperial Weapons Cache. Ususi herself also discovered that the Keystone could be used to \"burn out\" the influence of the Elder Evil from those it had claimed, effectively destroying them, amongst other abilities it granted with its mastery of the Celestial Nadir. While inside the Celestial Nadir, it could also be used to officiate burials and scrape away stone (presumably through supernatural means).\nIt also could be used to give off light, like a lamp.\nNumerous Keystones had been created in the times of Imaskar, though all were thought to be lost by 1374 DR. In fact, one Keystone was in the care of Briartan, a druid in charge of the Mucklestones by decree of the Circle of Leth, until it was wrested from him by the Talontar blightlord Gameliel in 1373 DR, who was planning on using the Keystone to extend the reach of the Rotting Mans forces. Before he had the opportunity, however, he was disintegrated by the Deep Imaskari wizard Ususi Manaallin, who seized the Keystone.\nUsusi employed the Keystone to open a path into the Celestial Nadir, through which she reached Yeshelmaar. A different servant of the Rotting Man, Fallon, tricked her into giving him the Keystone, which he carried to Anammelech Ususi had the stone once more in her keeping after the cleric Marrec slew the blightlord.Though she is never shown reclaiming the Keystone in Lady of Poison, she is shown to possess it after Anammelechs death. As she is unconscious while Marrec slays Anammelech, he mustve taken the stone for her, though the act was not shown.\nLater that year, Ususi discovered a fragment of Celestial Nadir crystal in a store within Two Stars. Throughout the rest of 1373, and until Tarsakh of 1374, Ususi carried the Keystone while searching throughout the Unapproachable East for entrances to the Celestial Nadir located in Imaskari ruins along the way to Vaelan, which she decided to leave for last. The Elder Evil Pandorym sent forces after her, most likely because it required the Keystone.\n*Briartan\n*Gameliel\n*Nentyarch\n*Fallon\n*Anammelech\n*Ususi Manaallin"
