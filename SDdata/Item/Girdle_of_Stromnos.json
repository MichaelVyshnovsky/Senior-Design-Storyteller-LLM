        "mainbody": "The '''''girdle of Stromnos''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[belt]] created by [[Presdon]] of the [[Vast]].",
        "Description": "The belt was a plain in appearance but distinctly wide girdle.",
        "Powers": "The ''girdle of Stromnos'' possessed a simple enchantment that significantly enhanced its wearer's strength, making them as strong as a [[hill giant]].",
        "History": "The ''girdle of Stromnos'' was created by Presdon of the Vast several centuries before [[1281 DR]]. The [[enchanter]] once encountered a hungry hill giant named [[Stromnos]] while gathering [[spell component]]s. Presdon survived the encounter and named the belt after Stromnos. The girdle then was passed along to the enchanter's bodyguard [[Dendes the Wry]]. The belt was lost some time late outside [[Ordulin]] as Dendes was filled in the line of duty.\n\nFor the several centuries , the ''girdle of Stromnos'' was though lost, until it reappeared in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. The belt was worn by [[Flozem]], one of the two bodyguards employed by [[Marketh]] of the [[Dorn's Deep]] in the [[Spine of the World]]."
