'''''Spidersilk jerkins''''' were types of mysterious light armor worn by [[drow]] [[Kinslayer (prestige class)|kinslayers]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Spidersilk jerkins'' were in reality made using [[drider silk]], rather than [[spidersilk]] from a regular [[giant spider]]. These armors were rare because of the dangers of procurement of the material, but the resulting [[light armor]] was as protective as masterwork [[studded leather]] armor while it weighed almost nothing and showed no restrictions to the wearer's movements. As such, spellcasters could freely wear ''spidersilk jerkins'' without the armor restricting and interfering with their magic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''spidersilk jerkins'' were worn by drow kinslayers who prowled the [[Neverwinter Wood]] in search of [[wood elves]] and other creatures to slaughter. They were led by [[priestess]]es of [[Lolth]].
