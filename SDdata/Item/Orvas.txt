'''Orvas''' was an insinuated or ingested [[poison]].

==Description==
Orvas was a bittersweet-tasting liquid with a translucent green tint.

==Effects==
Orvas was poisonous if ingested, but usually it was introduced directly into the bloodstream via a wound. It caused immediate damage upon entering the bloodstream and for a short time thereafter. If ingested, the poison damage was delayed for several hours. Orvas was effective against any mammal.

Orvas was an antidote to [[varrakas]] if it was insinuated into the bloodstream before the poisonous effects of varrakas could take place.

==History==
Orvas was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as ''[[The Nathlum]]''. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage [[Lethchauntos the Black]], during his time spent with an [[orc]] tribe in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage [[Phrandjas]] of [[Port Llast]] and sold to local [[alchemist]]s before the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR.
