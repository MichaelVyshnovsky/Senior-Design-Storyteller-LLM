'''Silver spark''' was a [[poison]] sometimes used by [[holy slayer]] [[assassin]]s of the [[Soft Whisper]] in [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
This poison was a radiant vapor. Rumor stated that is was derived from distilled moonlight and bottled passion. It possessed a rich and musky aroma.

==Uses==
Victims could not resist breathing deeply of this perfumed poison once a holy slayer offered it. Once inhaled, intense pain wracked the victim's body for several intense minutes.
