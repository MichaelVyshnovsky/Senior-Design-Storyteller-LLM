The Moonsplinter was a unique enchanted stone dagger that belonged to Gunloda Ebonspire before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War.
The Moonsplinter possessed several powerful enchantments. It increased defenses of the creature wielding the dagger, it gave them improved protections from threats of mundane and magical nature, granted them resistance to spells, and improved their speed and reaction in combat. Additionally, the Moonsplinter allowed the wielder to cast the globe of invulnerability spell. The dagger held five charges of the spell.
After Gunlodas death, the Moonsplinter was interred along with its mistress within the deepest levels of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor. The series of interconnected dwarven tombs were protected by ancient constructs and magics that allowed people in need to claim the artifacts from the crypts if the appropriate donation was made.
