The '''''Moonsplinter''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] stone [[dagger]] that belonged to [[Gunloda Ebonspire]] before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[Weeping War]].

==Powers==
The ''Moonsplinter'' possessed several powerful enchantments. It increased defenses of the creature wielding the dagger, it gave them improved protections from threats of mundane and magical nature, granted them resistance to spells, and improved their speed and reaction in combat. Additionally, the ''Moonsplinter'' allowed the wielder to cast the ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'' spell. The dagger held five charges of the spell.

==History==
After Gunloda's death, the ''Moonsplinter'' was interred along with its mistress within the deepest levels of the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The series of interconnected dwarven tombs were protected by ancient [[construct]]s and magics that allowed people in need to claim the artifacts from the crypts if the appropriate donation was made.
