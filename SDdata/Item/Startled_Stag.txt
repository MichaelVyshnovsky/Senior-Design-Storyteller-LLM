'''''The Startled Stag''''' was a strange ''[[cursed]]'' [[stag]] statue created sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''The Startled Stag'' was a {{SI|15|lb|k|long=yes}}, two-and-a-half feet tall, [[bronze]] statue that depicted a terrified stag. The statue was hollowed on the inside and hid a bottle or a similar receptacle. The bottle's neck with the stopper could be accessed between the stag's shoulder blades.

==Powers==
If anyone were to remove the stopper from between the stag's shoulder blades, a clear, odorless gas escaped the bottle. The only evidence of the gas was its [[sulfur]]us taste of rotten [[egg]]s. The gas affected every breathing creature within ten to forty minutes, freezing them in place. This ''[[paralysis]]'' lasted for a period of time between one and twenty days.

==History==
''The Startled Stag'' was one of the more unique items available from the [[Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop]] in the Living City, [[Raven's Bluff]], run by [[Misti Morgan]], a proprietor of the establishment and a [[thief]], in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
