        "mainbody": "agesbane dust was a magical substance that reacted violently to arcane magic.\nThe dust appeared as a dark, glittering powder similar to ground glass. When applied, it faded to near-invisibility, making it extremely hard to notice by a victim or investigator.\nOnce applied, the dust caused a violent backlash against any arcane magic cast near it, potentially injuring or killing the spellcaster. \nIn 1373 DR, the shade Variance Amatick gifted a vial of magesbane to Keph Thingoleir in order to gauge his worth. Keph used the dust to sabotage the alchemical workshop of his brother Roderio Thingoleir, hoping to cause an embarrassing accident. He underestimated the power of the dust, and the resulting backlash nearly killed Roderio, drenching him in caustic acid and shredding him with shards of glass. Not knowing the cause of the disaster, his family assumed he had made a critical mistake while brewing potions."
