A Chijiriki () was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur.
A chijiriki was a standard spear between  in length that has been augmented with a length of weighted chain attached to its butt end. It offered the versatility of being used as a regular spear for thrusting and striking, while the weighted chain on the opposite end allowed for tripping attacks. By swinging the butt end, the weapon entangled an opponent, providing a means of immobilization or control during combat.
