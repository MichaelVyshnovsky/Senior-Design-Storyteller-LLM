'''''Fencer's Grace''''' were sets of light [[enchanted]] armor especially favored by duelists and brigands of the [[Sword Coast]].

==Description==
These sets of armor were especially designed for agile and fast fighters, such as duelists, as well as sailors and pirates who often tumbled on board their ships at sea.

==Powers==
''Fencer's Grace'' was enhanced with a ''+1'' enchantment as well as improved the wearer's abilities of effectively parrying attacks and tumbling out of harm's way. Additionally, it allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[cat's grace]]'' spell twice a day.

==History==
The most notable incident that involved a set of ''Fencer's Grace'' was when [[Lord Tygarian]] used it to pay a ransom to a notorious pirate, [[Baralen the Black]], who kidnapped the nobleman's daughter. However, the pirate did not return Tygarian's daughter after receiving this enchanted armor. When the woman found out, she flew into a fit of rage and struck Baralen the Black dead with a single blow and claimed ''Fencer's Grace''. Later, she used that set of armor to start her own fruitful piratical career.

In [[1372 DR]], one of these armors belonged to captain [[Herab]] of the [[Zhentarim]]-allied smuggling [[frigate]] ''[[Barracuda (ship)|Barracuda]]''.
