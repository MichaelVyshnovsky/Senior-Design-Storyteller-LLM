A '''''Lords' robe''''' was an [[enchanted]] piece of clothing given to all [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. It was one of three articles, referred to collecitvely as the [[Lord's ensemble]].

==Description==
These [[robe]]s were dark black and voluminous.

==Powers==
The [[magic]] of a ''Lords' robe'' disguised the shape and height of the Lord who wore it, making all Lords appear to be approximately {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall with an unknown gender. A ''[[true seeing]]'' [[spell]] could pierce the [[illusion]], but even in that case the physical nature of the robe made it difficult to distinguish physical features.
