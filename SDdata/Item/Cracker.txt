'''Crackers''' were crispy tidbits of [[bread]]. A selection with [[herb]]s from the [[Dalelands]] was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Description==
Crackers were produced in several different flavors: [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[pepper]], or savory. Packages contained three dozen crackers, and could be ordered either with a single flavor or in "Gourmet Packs" that contained all four flavors. In the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], crackers were sold during performances of [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Living City: Burton's Bouncing Bears|9}}
