Quick-loading was a quality that could be applied to crossbows. It creates a space in another dimension from which the wielder could quickly draw and reload bolts. Thus, the crossbow wielder did not have to spend time in actual combat readying and loading their weapon.
The spells shrink item and Leomunds secret chest were used when imbuing crossbows with this magical quality.
