'''Dark chocolate cherry cake''' was a type of quality pastry, not surprisingly, made using [[cherries]] and dark [[chocolate]], found in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the [[Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Dark chocolate cherry cake was among many pastries created at [[Polly's All Night Pastry Emporium]], caf√©, and catering business in Ravens Bluff. In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Sorduel Meytauc]] of the [[Ill Eagle Inn]], bought out Polly's pastries to pass them as his own in a competition at [[Mossbridges]]'s First [[Annual Year-End Festival]]. "Coincidentally," [[Polly (Ravens Bluff)|Polly's]] own invitation to partake in the competition disappeared at the same time. Sorduel Meytauc entered Polly's dark chocolate cherry cake but did not win the competition due to being found out and embarrassed by a group of adventurers of the Living City.
