        "mainbody": "Powder of coagulation was a type of magical, yellow powder that helped to heal wounds.\nThis powder typically came in either packets or pouches that contained around four to sixteen pinches.\nWhen an open wound was applied powder of coagulation all bleeding ceased and the recipients body healed to a small degree. If one used a whole packet or pouch, they could apply the powder to all creatures in an area by means of a blowpipe.\nIn the 14 century DR, three pinches of the powder of coagulation were one of the many rewards that Calvin Longbottle gave to a group of adventurers after they had brought back artifacts from the legendary ship Strongwind.\nFollowing the Time of Troubles, this powder was one of many magical items that a newly admitted goldeye could obtain, curtesy of the Church of Waukeen.\n* Pizentios, a gruesome necromancer from the isle of Sahu in Zakhara, carried several pouches of powder of coagulation.\n* Among the warriors of the drow city of Sshamath, this powder was commonly carried while out on patrol."
