'''Garlic''' was a common form of [[spices|spice]] found in the Realms.

==Description==
Garlic plants had hollow long dark green spear-shaped leaves. The top of the plant had a round cluster of fine white flowers. The plant was renown for its strong smell, making it easy to identify in the wild, poultices, or foods. The scent became potent when the leaves were crushed. Garlic plants flowered in the mid-to late summer.{{Cite dragon/82/Wounds and weeds|16}}

If one were to cast ''[[speak with plants]]'' on some garlic, it's likely the plants would speak to the caster about cooking and vampires.{{Cite organized play/LC/With Great Risks|15}}

==Availability==
Garlic was often cultivated in gardens. The plant preferred moist earth and humid locations and in the wild, could be seen growing in meadows or thin forests. Places in the Realms where garlic was known to be cultivated included:
* The [[Dalelands]].

==Cost==
Garlic was not an expensive spice. In most economies, {{SI|1|oz.|long=yes}} of garlic sold for only a [[copper piece]]. [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold a large clove of garlic for 3 coppers and a large bud of garlic for 5 coppers. A quart of pickled garlic sold for 5 [[silver piece]]s.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], Rab Bitnez created the first in Faer√ªn [[Garlic vine|garlic-bearing vine]].
