Garlic was a common form of spice found in the Realms.
Garlic plants had hollow long dark green spear-shaped leaves. The top of the plant had a round cluster of fine white flowers. The plant was renown for its strong smell, making it easy to identify in the wild, poultices, or foods. The scent became potent when the leaves were crushed. Garlic plants flowered in the mid-to late summer.
If one were to cast speak with plants on some garlic, its likely the plants would speak to the caster about cooking and vampires.
Garlic was often cultivated in gardens. The plant preferred moist earth and humid locations and in the wild, could be seen growing in meadows or thin forests. Places in the Realms where garlic was known to be cultivated included
* The Dalelands.
