The medusa shield was a strange and likely unique enchanted buckler decorated with a snarling medusas face on its outward side.
The shield appeared unremarkable at first sight in design and crafting. However, if wilded in battle, the visage of a snarling medusa appeared to be more than just decoration. The shield possessed a +1 enchantment and made its wielder immune to all poisons. It also held ten charges of the flesh to stone spell that could be activated at will, making the medusa image on the shield petrify the wielders opponent.
All information about the medusa shield was obscured by mystery. In the , the medusa shield made its way to the city of Westgate where it was sold among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the citys busy Market Triangle.
