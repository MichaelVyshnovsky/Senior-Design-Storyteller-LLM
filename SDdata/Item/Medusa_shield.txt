The '''''medusa shield''''' was a strange and likely unique [[enchanted]] [[buckler]] decorated with a snarling [[medusa]]'s face on its outward side.

==Powers==
The [[shield]] appeared unremarkable at first sight in design and crafting. However, if wilded in battle, the visage of a snarling medusa appeared to be more than just decoration. The shield possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and made its wielder immune to all [[poison]]s. It also held ten charges of the ''[[flesh to stone]]'' [[spell]] that could be activated at will, making the medusa image on the shield petrify the wielder's opponent.

==History==
All information about the ''medusa shield'' was obscured by mystery. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the ''medusa shield'' made its way to the city of [[Westgate]] where it was sold among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's busy [[Market Triangle]].
