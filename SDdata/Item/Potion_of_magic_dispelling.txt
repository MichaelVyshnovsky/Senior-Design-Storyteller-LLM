Potions of magic dispelling were a rare type of potion that stripped the imbiber of all magical effects.
These potions were typically kept in wide-necked ceramic or clay stout jars. Flasks were corked with a large stopper. Each contained enough liquid for one full dose.
In the early 14 century DR, some potions of magic dispelling were in use among hunters and shamans of the Black Raven tribe that hunted the Ice Lakes and Cold Marshes area by the Spine of the World in northwest Faer√ªn. One such potion was claimed by a couple of white dragons that nested in the River Caves where the Black Raven River spilled onto the surface.
