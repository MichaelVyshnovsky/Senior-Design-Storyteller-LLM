A razor and cap was a pair of religious items in the Realms often carried by clerics who used them to shave their heads.
The leather caps were made in Ordulin and ensured the shave was uniform each time by leaving a perfect circle exposed where the hair would be shaved with the razor.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 4 gold pieces and included a leather case for the razor.
* Razors and caps were favored by clerics and priests.
