The '''''infernal rapier''''' was an [[enchanted]] weapon that harnessed the infernal magics of [[Avernus]] from the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The [[rapier]] possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that made its physical attacks stronger and guided the wielder's arm toward the targets. Additionally, the blade's wielder damage output was as great as their spellcasting abilities. As such, the ''infernal rapier'' boosted the wielder's resistance to enemy [[spell]]s. Once per day, the ''infernal rapier'' allowed the wielder to cast the ''[[planar ally]]'' spell, summoning a [[cambion]].

==History==
The ''infernal rapier'' belonged to [[Mizora]], a fiendish servant of [[Zariel]] who was captured by the cult of the [[Absolute]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. She had the weapon fashioned to represent the soul of her [[warlock]], [[Wyll Ravengard]], summarizing it in heated infernal steel. She offered the weapon as a reward for her warlock, were he to rescue Mizora from the [[mind flayer]] colony underneath the [[Moonrise Towers]].
