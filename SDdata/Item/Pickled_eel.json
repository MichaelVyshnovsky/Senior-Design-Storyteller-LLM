        "mainbody": "'''Pickled eel''' was a fairly common food from the city-states of the [[Blade Kingdoms]], owing to the abundant [[eel]] catch from the [[Akanamere]].",
        "Availablity": "These pickled creatures were so common, and they could be found stocked up in the pantries of noble families, as well as the abode of the Prince-elect of [[Sumbria]], the grand [[Palace of Manniccis]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, Princess [[Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria]] was teaching herself [[the Art]], in secrecy from the disapproving family using a copy of ''[[Lady Faveretti's Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners)]]''. Guidenceless, the young woman's many spells misfired. One such mishandling of the [[arcane]] led to a [[summoning]] of a strange big green-furry-thing that promptly raided the palace's pantry, devouring all the picked eel, leaving gnawed leftovers scattered around the royal villa. The creature continued to plague the palace, becoming more of a vermin nuisance than a danger to its inhabitants."
