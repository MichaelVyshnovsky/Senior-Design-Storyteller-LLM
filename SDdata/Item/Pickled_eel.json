        "mainbody": "Pickled eel was a fairly common food from the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms, owing to the abundant eel catch from the Akanamere.\nThese pickled creatures were so common, and they could be found stocked up in the pantries of noble families, as well as the abode of the Prince-elect of Sumbria, the grand Palace of Manniccis.\nIn the , Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria was teaching herself the Art, in secrecy from the disapproving family using a copy of Lady Faverettis Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners). Guidenceless, the young womans many spells misfired. One such mishandling of the arcane led to a summoning of a strange big green-furry-thing that promptly raided the palaces pantry, devouring all the picked eel, leaving gnawed leftovers scattered around the royal villa. The creature continued to plague the palace, becoming more of a vermin nuisance than a danger to its inhabitants."
