        "mainbody": "{{Wikipedia article|amblygonite}}\n'''Ulvaen''', also called '''amblygonite''', was a soft but shatter-resistant [[Fancy stones|fancy stone]] that was prized in the Realms.",
        "Description": "This gem occurred in pale to deep yellow hues and was easily worked, even by the unskilled, into large cabochons or faceted gems that were popular in jewelry. A typical specimen had a base value of 100gp.",
        "Powers": "Ulvaen was prized for its healing and regenerative properties. If placed in a wound, a ulvaen crystal would melt away in a matter of minutes and deliver its healing magic. How much healing was completely random for any given stone. As the healing magic suffused the wound it would first attempt to stop any bleeding. If that succeeded then damaged organs had a chance to be restored. If that succeeded then any open wounds might close. And finally, if all previous healing attempts were successful, there was a chance for an improvement in overall health, similar to a ''[[cure light wounds]]''. Regardless of when the healing magic ran out, some modest health benefit was gained. If the injury was internal, then the ulvaen was placed on the victim's tongue until it dissolved. [[Human]]s, [[demihumans]], and other [[humanoids]] could be healed by this gemstone."
