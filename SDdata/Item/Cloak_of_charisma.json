        "mainbody": "cloak of charisma was a magical cloak that made the wearer more likable and persuasive.\nCloaks of charisma tended to be highly fashionable with a decorative silver trim. They were also quite lightweight.\nThe strength of the enchantment on a cloak of charisma could vary quite widely, with more powerful cloaks being significantly more expensive. Minor cloaks would cost about 4,000 gold pieces, moderately-powerful cloaks would cost about 16,000 gold pieces, and major cloaks would cost about 36,000 gold pieces.\n*Taluth, a malaugrym active in Westgate in the years following the Time of Troubles, possessed a minor cloak of charisma."
