        "mainbody": "chill blade was a magical dagger.\nWhen active, the blade glowed a pale and ghostly white.\nWhen activated at the bearers will the dagger dealt extra damage to a target. Furthermore, if they couldnt resist the spell, the targets ability to attack was hampered for a full hour. The more times they were struck, the more hampered they were.\nThe blade did less damage against the undead, but could turn them, forcing them to flee temporarily.\nA chill blade was resistant to cold.\nThese blades could be created from a well-made ferrous-bladed dagger, a snowflake or chunk of ice, a chill touch spell, lightning or electrical discharge of some kind, and a piece of rock crystal. As of 1368 DR, chill blades were worth around 1,000 gold pieces."
