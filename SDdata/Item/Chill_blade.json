        "Description": "When active, the blade glowed a pale and ghostly white.",
        "Power": "When activated at the bearer's will the dagger dealt extra damage to a target. Furthermore, if they couldn't resist the spell, the target's ability to attack was hampered for a full hour. The more times they were struck, the more hampered they were.\n\nThe blade did less damage against the [[undead]], but could [[turn undead|turn]] them, forcing them to flee temporarily.\n\nA ''chill blade'' was resistant to cold.",
        "Creation": "These blades could be created from a well-made [[iron|ferrous]]-bladed dagger, a snowflake or chunk of ice, a ''[[chill touch]]'' spell, lightning or electrical discharge of some kind, and a piece of [[rock crystal]]. As of [[1368 DR]], ''chill blades'' were worth around 1,000 gold pieces."
