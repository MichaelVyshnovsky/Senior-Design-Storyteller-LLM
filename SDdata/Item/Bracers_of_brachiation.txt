'''''Bracers of brachiation''''' were pairs of rather ordinary looking [[bracers]] that carried an [[item enchantment|enchantment]] making anyone who wore them proficient in the art of [[wikipedia:Brachiation|brachiation]], a form of arboreal movement common many types of apes.

==Powers==
While wearing ''bracers of brachiation'' an individual gained an ape-like proficiency in climbing and swinging from vines, trees, poles, [[rope]]s, and other forms dangling, flexible objects. This allowed an individual to swiftly travel from place to place within dense jungle environments. Additionally, these bracers could enhance a wearer's ability to jump and leap, similar to ''[[boots of striding and springing]]'', though this effect would only activate if a jump would culminate in some sort of activity related to brachiation. These included such things as moving through treetops, climbing a tree or pole, and grasping a rope, vine, or other flexible object vine.

==History==
In the land of [[Zakhara]], the region known as the [[Cities of the Ancients]] was host to a variety of [[magic item]]s whose creation were inspired by the gods that were once worshiped there in ancient times. Among these many magical items were ''bracers of brachiation''.<ref>

==Notable Owners==
* Some of the couriers that worked for [[Spider's Fleet o' Feet]] owned ''bracers of brachiation'' that they had either purchased or stolen to aid in their job.<ref>
* [[Elwin McAllister]], a sea captain in [[the Vast]].<ref>
* [[Narlgathra]], a [[red dragon]], had a pair of ''bracers of brachiation'' as part of his treasure horde in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]].<ref>
