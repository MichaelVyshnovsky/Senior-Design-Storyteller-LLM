        "mainbody": "Asheeras amulet was an enchanted amulet that was owned by the paladin Asheera.\nThe amulet was made entirely out of a gold-like substance.\nThis enchanted item increased the wearers resistance towards electricity, fire, magic, and attacks from reptilians. Only the most powerful of adventurers could wear the amulet.\nThis amulet was specially crafted for the paladin Asheera by magic-users of her world, to aid the struggle against Morag and her army of Old Ones. The knight wore it when entering the Source Stone and when meeting the Hero of Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. If Asheeras encounter with the Hero ended peacefully, she gifted the amulet to the Hero to help in protecting Faer√ªn and other worlds from the Old Ones. Otherwise she took it back to her homeworld."
