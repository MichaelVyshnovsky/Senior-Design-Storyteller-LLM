They were most commonly carved from single pieces of oak, duskwood, or weirwood. Leafy vines that maintained an eternally vibrant look wrapped around the shafts and upon their tops was mounted a pinecone.\nA thyrsus of the druid typically allowed its wielder to cast the following set of spells\nAnimate plants • control plants • plant growth • speak with plants • thorn spray\nThe original thyrsus of the druid was created by Craenoth Driel, a wood elf druid who hailed from Eaerlann. He ultimately died while defending the High Forest from the tanarukk forces of Hellgate Keep, who then plundered his creation.\nDriels acolytes, who greatly mourned the loss of their master and his creation, went on to create a multitude of derivative staves to honor his memory."
