A portable hole was a magic item that, as the name said, created a hole.
|John Stanko
A portable hole was a circle of black cloth, sometimes silk,
When a portable hole was spread on any flat surface, it opened an extra-dimensional hole to a non-dimensional space that was  wide and  deep. 
The spell plane shift was required in order to create a portable hole. If a portable hole was placed inside a bag of holding, a gateway was opened to another plane. The portable hole and bag of holding were both sucked in, as well as any unfortunate individual within .
A portable hole did not function within the phlogiston.
