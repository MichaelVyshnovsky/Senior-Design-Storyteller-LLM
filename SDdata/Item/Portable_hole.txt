A '''''portable hole''''' was a [[magic item]] that, as the name said, created a hole.
{{Quote|They fall for it every time.{{Cite MTG|AFR|033|{{MTGc|Portable Hole||AFR|#=33}}|[[John Stanko]]}}}}

==Description==
A ''portable hole'' was a circle of black cloth, sometimes [[silk]],

==Effects==
When a ''portable hole'' was spread on any flat surface, it opened an extra-dimensional hole to a non-dimensional space that was {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} wide and {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} deep. 

The spell ''[[plane shift]]'' was required in order to create a ''portable hole''. If a ''portable hole'' was placed inside a ''bag of holding'', a gateway was opened to another plane. The ''portable hole'' and ''bag of holding'' were both sucked in, as well as any unfortunate individual within {{SI|10|ft}}.

A ''portable hole'' did not function within the [[phlogiston]].<ref name="AiS.CAS2e-p18,84>

==Notable Owners==
* [[Jarlaxle]], the legendary [[drow]] leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], owned several extra-dimensional storage spaces, including a ''portable hole'', a ''bag of holding'', a ''[[foldable chest]]'', and a ''[[bottomless pouch]]''.
* [[Kiva]], the [[Halruaa]]n [[wild elf]] [[Inquisitor (Halruaa)|Inquisitrix]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name="TMH>
