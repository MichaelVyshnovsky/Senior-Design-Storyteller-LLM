        "mainbody": "orns of collapsing were a variety of magical horns designed to cave-in natural or artificial ceilings.\nThese horns were rather mundane in appearance, often made in the form of a bugle or signal horn.\nAll horns of collapsing had a 10% of their effect misfiring, though a misfire was guaranteed if the trumpeter didnt speak the proper command word before sounding it.\nThe intended effect when sounding a horn of collapsing was to cause a the collapse of an overhead section of roof its pointed at, measuring  by , as far away as  from the trumpeter. During a misfire a horn of collapsing would instead cause an area of roof directly above the trumpeter to fall down, though if it occurred in an outdoor space devoid of a roof the horn would instead cause 2 to 12 fist-sized rocks to rain down upon the trumpeter.\nAround the year  or so, a community of hobgoblins in the Moonsea region known simply as the Hobgoblin Kingdom had a treasure room with such magical items as a heavy crossbow of accuracy, horn of collapsing, a portable hole, a ring of feather falling, and a wand of secret door and trap location.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, a horn of collapsing could be found on the Holy Mountain of Kus within the pedestal of a long neglected shrine to Bimasara, the Padhrasattva of Barter."
