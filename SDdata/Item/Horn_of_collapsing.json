        "mainbody": "'''''Horns of collapsing''''' were a variety of [[enchanted|magical]] [[horn]]s designed to cave-in natural or artificial ceilings.",
        "Description": "These horns were rather mundane in appearance, often made in the form of a bugle or signal horn.",
        "Powers": "All ''horns of collapsing'' had a 10% of their effect misfiring, though a misfire was guaranteed if the trumpeter didn't speak the proper [[command word]] before sounding it.\n\nThe intended effect when sounding a ''horn of collapsing'' was to cause a the collapse of an overhead section of roof its pointed at, measuring {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} by {{SI|20|ft}}, as far away as {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} from the trumpeter. During a misfire a ''horn of collapsing'' would instead cause an area of roof directly above the trumpeter to fall down, though if it occurred in an outdoor space devoid of a roof the horn would instead cause 2 to 12 fist-sized rocks to rain down upon the trumpeter.",
        "History": "Around the year {{YearlinkName|1358}} or so, a community of [[hobgoblin]]s in the [[Moonsea]] region known simply as the [[Hobgoblin Kingdom]] had a treasure room with such magical items as a ''[[crossbow of accuracy|heavy crossbow of accuracy]]'', ''horn of collapsing'', a ''[[portable hole]]'', a ''[[ring of feather falling]]'', and a ''[[wand of secret door and trap location]]''.<ref>{{PoR-FRC-time}}\n\nIn the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], a ''horn of collapsing'' could be found on the [[Holy Mountain of Kus]] within the pedestal of a long neglected shrine to [[Bimasara]], the [[Padhrasattva]] of Barter.<ref>"
