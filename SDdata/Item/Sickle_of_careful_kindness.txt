The '''''sickle of careful kindness''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[sickle]] crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The blade was especially sharp and it could be swung with great speed and surety.

==Powers==
The ''sickle of careful kindness'' was able to clear and bestow blight. An injury from the ''sickle'' had a chance of being grievously terrible and resistant to even [[magical]] healing, however it would only allow this if it acknowledged the judgment of its wielder to recognize danger.

==Notable Owners==
* Pikel, a [[dwarf]] [[druid]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[seal of devotion]]''.
