        "mainbody": "The staff of the magi was a powerful magical artifact.\nGenerally, a staff of the magi was a long wooden staff encased in iron and inscribed with magical sigils and runes.\nThe staff of the magi had a number of abilities that were permanent and a number of others that required charges. It bestowed spell resistance upon its bearer, although the bearer could willingly lower the spell resistance in order to absorb spell energy in order to add more charges. If the staffs charges ever exceeded 50, or if the bearer chose to do so, it broke and exploded in a powerful magical burst. When this happened, the bearer had a 50% chance of either being destroyed by the staffs energy or traveling to another plane of existence.\nThe staff allowed unlimited use of the following abilities detect magic, enlarge person, hold portal, light, mage armor, and mage hand. Other versions allowed unlimited casting of arcane lock, enlarge/reduce, and protection from evil and good.\nThe staff was created with 50 charges. Each of the following abilities used one charge per use dispel magic, fireball, ice storm, invisibility, knock, lightning bolt, passwall, pyrotechnics, wall of fire, and web. Each of the following abilities used two charges per use summon monster IX, plane shift, telekinesis (up to 400 lbs.).\nOther versions of the staff could cast spells by spending different number of charges. For two charges flaming sphere, invisibility, knock, or web. For three charges dispel magic. For four charges ice storm, or wall of fire. For five charges passwall, or telekinesis. For seven charges conjure elemental, fireball (at 7th level), lightning bolt (at 7th level), or plane shift.\n# Anastra Sylun√© Silverhand One of the Seven Sisters died after breaking her staff of the magi to protect the Twisted Tower.\n# Asharra An aarakocra wizard from Chult, active in the late 15 century DR.\n# Hoch Miraz A wizard from Calimshan, believed to have sunk to his doom off the coast of Gundarlun with a staff of the magi in his possession.\n# Larloch Former Sorcerer-King of Jiksidur.\n# Prismal the Outrageous A wizard in Ravens Bluff.\n# Rhangaun A lich and senior member of the Twisted Rune.\n# Sammaster Former Chosen of Mystra and founder of the Cult of the Dragon\n# Ulraunt Keeper of the Tomes at Candlekeep reputedly owned a staff with the same powers as a staff of the magi and more.\n# Catti-brie \n# Braethan Cazondur A Masked Lord of Waterdeep who attempted a coup against the Open Lord in 1491 DR."
