An '''egg beater''' was a type of cooking utensil found in [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LC/How Long Can You Tread Water?|12}}<ref group="note" name="rarity">While it is not stated in the adventure how common this item is, an educated guess can be derived from the cargo ship's destination. As the shipment was going to a mere "small coastal community", rather than a major city, it could be reasoned that this utensil was relatively common by that time. It utilized a [[gear]]-driven mechanism to rotate a set of "beaters" to fulfill similar tasks as [[whisk]]s (such as beating [[egg]]s).<ref>{{Cite dungeon/64/The Mads Chefs of Lac Anchois|69}}

==History==
Sometime in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the cargo ship ''[[The Gentle Lady]]'' was delivering a shipment of farmer and merchant goods to a small coastal community in the [[Dragon Reach]].{{Cite organized play/LC/How Long Can You Tread Water?|9-10}} Among the goods being carried by the ship was a crate full of cookware that included four egg beaters.
