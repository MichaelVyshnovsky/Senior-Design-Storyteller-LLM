        "mainbody": "'''''The Mighty Cloth''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[monk]]'s garb from [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]].",
        "Powers": "''The Mighty Cloth'' was enchanted to constantly bestow the ''[[bull's strength]]'' onto its wearer, and it possessed the ''unwavering bull'' magic that made the wearer impossible to push or knock off their feet. This massive strength boost also made it much harder for the wearer to be restrained. They also could perform a bull rush, fiercely and powerfully tacking their opponents down.",
        "History": "Sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''The Mighty Cloth'' was worn by [[Kimigha Poji]], one of the monks of the port city of [[Nyanzaru]], who fought against the [[Headless Serpent, Secret Venom]] gang. The cloth later found its way into the hands of [[Talli]], a [[Harper]] quartermaster, who followed a fellow Harper hero [[Jaheira]] to the [[Last Light Inn]] in the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
