'''''Seeker orbs''''', were [[wizard]]ly [[crystal]] orb implements that glistened with brillian magical light inside, popularized in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Seeker orbs'' helped wizards focus on the most vulnerable parts of the targets, making their spells strike true and deal more damage. With each critical spell's strike, brilliant luminescence inside the ''orbs'' flared.

==History==
In the 15{{th}} century DR, various ''seeker orbs'' could be found in possession of spellcasters in the [[Sword Mountains]], [[Neverwinter Wood]], areas surrounding the city and markets of [[Neverwinter]], and found in the ruins of [[Illefarn]].
