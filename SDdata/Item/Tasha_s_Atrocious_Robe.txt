'''''Tasha's Atrocious Robe''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[robe]], created by the planeswalking enchantress [[Tasha]] from the world of [[Greyhawk]].

==Powers==
Tasha's robe possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and granted the wearer increased protection against mundane and magical threats. Additionally, the wearer of ''Tasha's Atrocious Robe'' became proficient in ''[[Arcane magic|arcane]]'' defense against ''[[enchantment]]'' school of magic and was granted the knowledge and abilities necessary to master ''enchantment'' spell focus.

==History==
Despite Tasha being renowned on Toril for her spell that caused ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter|uncontrollable laughter]]'', she also created this lesser-known magical robe. ''Tasha's Atrocious Robe'' was acquired by a planeswalker from [[Westgate]] known only as [[Mintassan]] the Magnificent and brought to Toril. The eccentric [[wizard]] added Tasha's enchanted outfit to his collection, available to be viewed with some items in it available for purchase at [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] store in Westgate's [[Market Triangle]]. The robe was still there as of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
