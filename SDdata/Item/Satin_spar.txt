'''Satin spar''', also known as '''feather gypsum''', was a variety of [[gypsum]] that had a sparkling sheen. It was mainly used in carvings.

==Description==
This [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] was too soft for jewelry but accepted a good polish. Satin spar was naturally white, pink, pale orange, or pale brown, but could be dyed to almost any solid hue (this process ruined its sparkle, however). A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.

==Powers==
These stones could partially protect against ''[[magic missile]]s'' if worn, carried or touched at the time of missile impact. One satin spar could absorb one half the damage of one ''magic missile'', vaporizing in the process.
