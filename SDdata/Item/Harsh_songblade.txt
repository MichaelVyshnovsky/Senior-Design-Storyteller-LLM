A harsh songblade was an enchanted sword meant to be wielded by a bard.
Any heavy or light blade could be enchanted to become a harsh songblade.
Like other songblades, harsh songblades were magically sharp and strong weapons that could be used as implements for bardic spellcasting.
A bard could use the blade to channel thundering magic, causing it to unleash a wail that could daze the bards foes, leaving anyone within  senseless.
