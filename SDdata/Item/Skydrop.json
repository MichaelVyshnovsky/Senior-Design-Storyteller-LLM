        "mainbody": "Skydrop was the common name given to tektite material fragments of glass of meteoric origin found beneath the shifting dunes of Anauroch and other deserts.\nSkydrop stones were usually clear to lightly shaded with a glassy luster. These stones were left uncut and merely polished and mounted in a claw setting as earrings and pendants. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.\nA creature touching, wearing, or carrying a skydrop gemstone was immune to petrification."
