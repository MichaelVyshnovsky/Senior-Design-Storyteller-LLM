'''''Azer warhammers''''' were [[enchanted]] bludgeons wielded by [[azer]]s of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].

==Description==
''Azer warhammers'' were one-handed [[warhammer]]s that gleamed with cold and dark [[obsidian]], same as the cold gleam of the azers who forged them.

==Powers==
The weapons possessed an enchantment that scorched the targets with each successful strike. Additionally, the weapon allowed the wielder to release magical fire pent up within the weapon, setting all around it aflame.
