Azer warhammers were enchanted bludgeons wielded by azers of the Elemental Plane of Fire.
Azer warhammers were one-handed warhammers that gleamed with cold and dark obsidian, same as the cold gleam of the azers who forged them.
The weapons possessed an enchantment that scorched the targets with each successful strike. Additionally, the weapon allowed the wielder to release magical fire pent up within the weapon, setting all around it aflame.
