A '''''spellstaff''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[elf|elven]] [[quarterstaff]] wielded by the inhabitants of ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
A ''spellstaff'' was a {{SIAdj|6'|'"|long=yes|adj=long}} [[oak]]en quarterstaff but was as light as a piece of [[balsa]] wood. The surface of the weapon was covered in glyphs and runes resembling flames and bolts of electricity.

==Powers==
A ''spellstaff'' could be wielded as a sturdy implement of battle but it was enchanted to catch, absorb, and store ''[[lightning bolt]]s'', ''[[fireball]]s'', and similar fire and lightning [[spell]]s. The wielder could release stored destructive magics at a target with a simple double-tap.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a member of the [[Veiled Ones]] adventuring group, [[Ghleanna Stormlake]], received a ''spellstaff'' from the [[baelnorn]] [[Miroden Silverblade]]. The defender of the ''[[mythal]]'' gifted the ancient weapon to the [[half-elven]] [[sorceress]] after she suffered numerous shocks and burns from the [[Cult of the Dragon]] mages. Later, the staff was instrumental in the group's battle against the leader of the cult, [[Kya Mordrayn]]. The [[Wearer of Purple]] sent a crackling ''lightning bolt'' toward Ghleanna, allowing her to absorb the spell, returning it back on Mordrayn, and badly burning her flesh. The staff was also instrumental in protecting her allies from the fiery breath of the cult's [[dracolich]], [[Pelendralaar]]. Instead of incinerating the adventurers, Ghleanna's ''spellstaff'' absorbed the dragon's flames. Under such stress, the weapon started to smoke, and its glyphs blazed brightly.
