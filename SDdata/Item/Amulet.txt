An '''amulet''', sometimes called a '''periapt''' or a '''pendant''', was a trinket that was usually enchanted with some sort of [[magic]]. Some used an amulet for other means, such as to show their faith to a certain [[deity]] in the form of a [[holy symbol]].

==Description==
Amulets were usually hung on a cord or chain, which could be made from many materials, from something as simple as string to [[gold]]. The object could then be put around the neck, and it would bestow power upon the wearer. Some amulets held large [[gem]]stones, such as a [[greenstone amulet]], whereas some were made of other materials and melded into specific shapes.

==Notable Amulets==
* ''[[Amulet of fire breath]]''
* ''[[Amulet of Alcedor]]''
* ''[[Hand of Kiaransalee's glory]]''
* ''[[Pendant of Ashaba]]''
* ''[[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]]''

==Usage==
* An amulet was a common form for the [[holy symbol]]s used by [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s.
* [[Shield guardian]]s were always built keyed to a magical amulet that allowed the wearer to control the [[construct]] it was tied to.
===Spell Components===
Amulets were used as a [[material component]] in a handful of spells across the Realms, which typically didn't consume them during casting:
* ''[[Absorption]]'' required an amulet worth no less than a 1,000 [[gold piece]]s.
* ''[[Call society]]'' required a small amulet from one of the sorcerous societies of [[Zakhara]].<ref>
* ''[[Fire wings]]'' required a golden amulet in the shape of a [[phoenix]], worth no less than 50 gold pieces.
* ''[[Reanimation]]'' required a golden amulet in the shape of a phoenix.
* ''[[Scrying (spell)|Scrying]]'', when cast by a [[Goldeye]], could use an amulet in place of a [[divine focus]].<ref>
