An amulet, sometimes called a periapt or a pendant, was a trinket that was usually enchanted with some sort of magic. Some used an amulet for other means, such as to show their faith to a certain deity in the form of a holy symbol.
Amulets were usually hung on a cord or chain, which could be made from many materials, from something as simple as string to gold. The object could then be put around the neck, and it would bestow power upon the wearer. Some amulets held large gemstones, such as a greenstone amulet, whereas some were made of other materials and melded into specific shapes.
