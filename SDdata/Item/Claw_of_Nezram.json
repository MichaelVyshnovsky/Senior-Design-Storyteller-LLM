        "mainbody": "The claw of Nezram was a unique magic item enchanted by the wizard Nezram.\nThe claw was a replica of a humanoid hand that was made from ivory and studded with rubies. Sharp talons stood in place of regular fingernails.\nThe claw was an intelligent sentient item that initially battled the will of anyone trying to control it.\nThe claw of Nezram possessed several powers. The most mundane of these was scratching any itch the wielder had when commanded to do so. The claw could be order to attack enemies in combat, slashing at them and attempting to grip their throats where it would squeeze until the target died. If the claw latched onto a targets weapon hand then they were unable to use that hand in combat. The claw could also glow red if rubies were nearby.\nFive claws of Nezram were known to exist. All were held in the possession of the powerful wizard Hodkamset."
