        "mainbody": "Carrion crawler brain juice, also referred to as carrion crawler mucus, was a paralytic contact poison extracted from, sometimes by simply bashing, a carrion crawlers brain, or scraping it off from its carapace.\nThis substance was a sticky and membranous liquid.\nCarrion crawler brain juice was not deadly but very quick-acting upon contact with flesh. When touched by unprotected skin, the poison could paralyze for approximately one minute.\nOne of the recipes for the refined version of the poison called for salts of carrion crawler tentacles and a special type of alchemical vitriol.\n*Dessra of the Dark Desires was a Waterdhavian lady entertainer who kept her chambers trapped with concealed crossbows and wore false nails, all coated with drow poisons and carrion crawler brain juice. She was also immune to both after dousing herself with them throughout the years.\n* Doorknobs smeared with contact poison were often coated with carrion crawler brain juice and sold for 900 gp.\n*Orc tribes of interior Faer√ªn often used contact poisons, such as carrion crawler brain juice, to coat the Urghosh locking mechanisms for extra security.\n*Ulathlasss was a type of enchanted oil that generated heavy green smoke that was used by the Scaled Ones.
