}}A '''''potion of levitation''''' was a [[potion]] that allowed its imbiber to ''[[levitate]]''.

==Description==
These potions allowed levitation of the imbiber only, up to a maximum weight of 6,000 [[gp]] equivalent. Thus, it was possible that the imbiber could carry another being or items, given that their combined weight was less than the cap.

===Ingredients===
Suggested special ingredients for such potions were eyes of [[beholder]]s or [[will-o'-wisp]] essence. The lower tentacles of a [[haundar]] were a potent ingredient. The brain of a [[flumph]] could also be employed as an ingredient, when ground and liquefied. Each flumph brain yielded three potions.{{Cite dragon/246/The Ecology of the Flumph|78}}

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], whenever the [[Wizards Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] was coerced into surrendering magical potions or gravely suspected that an [[adventurer]] requesting them would put them to misuse, they would instead gift faulty ''potions of levitation'' or [[potion of delusion|''potions of delusion'']].
