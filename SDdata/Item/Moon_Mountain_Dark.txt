Moon Mountain Dark was a brand of ale produced by the Moon Mountain Brewery, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This strong, hearty ale had the bitter tang of nuts and was a bit salty.
Moon Mountain Dark was a favorite among gnomes, halflings, and dwarves, but most humans did not like it as a straight drink. However, it was popular even with humans as a hot, mulled brew, and was served in many inns and taverns in the North and elsewhere.
