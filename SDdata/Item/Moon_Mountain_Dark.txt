'''Moon Mountain Dark''' was a brand of [[ale]] produced by the [[Moon Mountain Brewery]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|81}}

==Description==
This strong, hearty ale had the bitter tang of nuts and was a bit salty.

==Reputation==
Moon Mountain Dark was a favorite among [[gnomes]], [[halflings]], and [[dwarves]], but most [[humans]] did not like it as a straight drink. However, it was popular even with humans as a hot, [[mulled brew]], and was served in many inns and taverns in [[the North]] and elsewhere.
