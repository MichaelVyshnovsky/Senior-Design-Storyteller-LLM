The '''''Ivory Chain of Pao''''', also called the '''Demon Binder'''<ref>

==Description==
It was a length of chain, with links fashioned from [[ivory]]. Unusually, each link was finely carved into the figure of a man with arms outstretched and hooked, giving the effect of each holding hands with the next in the line.''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' says 3 meters (9.8 feet), while the later ''Book of Artifacts'' and ''Encyclopedia Magica'' say approximately 12 feet (3.6 meters), suggesting a conversion error, but the loss and reforming of links may explain any discrepancy.

==Powers==
The ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' had two different powers, depending on whether it was whole or separated into individual links, which had lesser powers of their own.


First, if the complete ''Ivory Chain'' was wrapped around a spirit or outer-planar creature, whether around their wrists, ankles, waist, neck, or an equivalent body part, that creature was instantly ''bound''. When the owner of the chain gripped one end and issued a command, the bound creature was compelled to obey that command to the full. As fragile as the chain seemed, the bound creature was utterly unable to break it or throw it off. The creature could not use any of its powers unless commanded by the chain's owner.

When one of the links was separated manually or broken by external force, the bound creature was freed and if broken the chain vanished entirely. Moreover, the ''Ivory Chain'' carried an odd curse or flaw: for every day that a creature was bound, there was a 1 in 20 chance that it would break and disappear in an instant, freeing the bound creature. In either case, the freed creature would be very possibly vengeful against its former captor. Afterward, the broken chain would magically reform into a single piece once more. If the ''Ivory Chain'' was completely disassembled, it had no more binding power.

Second, if a separated link was hurled at a spirit or outsider, it could incapacitate and bind it to a lesser extent. It produced shackles or chains of golden light that bound the creature for some six minutes, stripping its defenses,

If the chain was broken and had disappeared, it apparently had some unknown ability to reform itself and reappear, thanks to Master Pao's magical craft.

==History==
The ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' had a long and storied history, known well in [[Kara-Tur]] but barely heard of in [[Faerûn]], with only fragments known to sages who'd had communication with the east. The following account is considered to be only heavily abbreviated.

Its earliest history was very uncertain, but according to tradition, it was crafted by [[Master Pao]] of [[Mount Yei]], a [[Lesser Immortals|Lesser Immortal]] of the [[Celestial Empire]], during the Age of Red Earth. The ''Ivory Chain'' was gifted to the [[Nine Immortals|Nine Emperors]] as a symbol of their unity and the harmony of the peoples of the empire they ruled jointly.

However, in the seventh year of their reign, a daring thief infiltrated their treasury. The thief was inspired by another— some stories said it was an evil deity, others pinned the blame on [[Monkey (demigod)|Monkey, the Lord of Mischief]]. Regardless, the thief stole the ''Ivory Chain of Pao''. Not long after, the [[Black Leopard Cult]] grew in power and prominence in the south, causing strife. Around the same time, the Nine Emperors ascended to the [[Celestial Heavens]], and their reign passed to others,

In fact, the Black Leopard Cult had used the ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' to trap and bind the [[Black Leopard]] himself. In this state, he was known as a great demon panther. Under their villainous high priest [[Nan Kung Chi]], the cult terrorized the once-peaceful lands of the [[Fenghsintzu River]].

[[File:Tan Chin and Black Leopard.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Emperor Tan Chin breaks the ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' with the spear ''Shan Tien'' and releases the Black Leopard.''<ref group="note">Although this artwork on page 2 of ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' obviously depicts the ''Ivory Chain'', it is drawn as an ordinary chain, not as the linked figures described in the text.]]
Then, in the seventh year of his reign, in [[-1370 DR|Shou Year −120 (−1370 DR)]], Emperor Tan Chin heard rumors of the Black Leopard Cult's crimes and decided to destroy the cult. First, he sent seven parties of heroes, one after the other, but none came back alive. But he did learn that the high priest was a mighty [[wu jen]], and unassailable in his lair, and decided he must do it himself. First, he read in the libraries of [[Kuo Meilan]] the legend of the demon panther trapped by the ivory chain and compelled to serve the cult. Accompanied by his friend, the poet wu jen [[Kar Wuan]], Tan Chin went in secrecy to the main temple in [[Durkon]]. But Nan Kung Chi saw them with his magic and surprised them, and summoned the Black Leopard to kill the blood brothers. However, guided by Kar Wuan, Tan Chin cut the ''Ivory Chain'' with a sweep of his spear, ''[[Shan Tien]]'', and managed to free the Black Leopard, who quickly seized Nan Kung Chi and dragged him screaming into the night. The Second High Priest and the surviving cultists escaped out to sea, but their power was ended (but the cult would see resurgences).

The ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' reputedly vanished with the breaking of that single link, yet it seems to have later reformed and resurfaced, as it appeared in much later events.The history of the ''Ivory Chain'' presented in ''Book of Artifacts'' and reprinted in ''Encyclopedia Magica'' places the Copper Demon episode before the Hai Dynasty episode, which contradicts the Shou Lung timeline originally presented in ''Ochimo: The Spirit Warrior'' and reiterated in later sources. This article rearranges these events in correct chronological order. It should be noted that in this sequence there seems no need for it to be break, vanish, reform, and reappear, as it can remain in the possession of the Shou Lung emperors. In fact, as shown in a vision later, most of the chain was recovered and taken away, but who by and where to was not revealed. Someone else took a single link to a shrine on the [[Joi Chang Peninsula]].

It was believed to have stayed in the imperial treasuries of Shou Lung,<ref group="note">Staying in the imperial treasuries was originally presented as an alternative to being ground up and turned into the ''Acorn of Wo Mai''. as it was known to be in the possession of the Sixth Emperor Chin of the [[Hai Dynasty]] during the failed conquest of [[Wa]] in [[-274 DR|Shou Year 976 (−274 DR)]]. However, the fleet ran onto hidden reefs and sank, the Emperor was killed, and the ''Ivory Chain of Pao'', as well as the [[Emblems of Imperial Authority]] themselves, were presumed lost beneath the waves. However, according to rumor, [[Rourke]], a foreign pilot and navigator serving the emperor recovered the ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' and the Emblems and took them back to authorities in Shou Lung. Yet he was killed in the Imperial City and the treasures disappeared again. Without an emperor, dynasty, or Emblems, Shou Lung's decades-long Black Cycle of Years began.

In [[-240 DR|Shou Year 1010 (−240 DR)]], a band of champions known as the [[Seven Heroes and the Seven Nonmen]], among them the great [[Wo Mai]], went to do battle with the [[Copper Demon of Tros]], which had tyrannized the northwestern provinces of [[Shou Lung]] for years. While some accounts say they slew the fiend, In either case, the Copper Demon was imprisoned in the ''[[Acorn of Wo Mai]]'' and taken as a prize back to the imperial court,<ref group="note">It is unknown how, when, and where the lost ''Ivory Chain'' was recovered. Wo Mai likely found it from the same place he retrieved the Imperial Emblems—crypts underneath the Imperial City.

Afterward, the ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' disappeared again, at least from history if not from existence. According to some scholars, it had been ground up and the dust used to forge the ''Acorn of Wo Mai''. However, others believed it remained in imperial possession.

In any case, the single link recovered after the Black Leopard was freed remained at the shrine on the [[Joi Chang Peninsula]], until it was raided by four [[Kozakura]]n [[ronin]] who'd turned to banditry. They murdered all the priests, interrogating the last to learn about the magical ivory figurine, but didn't like his cryptic answer. With his dying breath, he laid an ''[[ancient curse]]'' upon them.

Later, the four ronin went to the ruins of [[Balanzia]], but there they quarreled and slew each other, with the figurine bearer falling down an old well. Cursed to be eternal guardians of the ivory figurine, they rose again as [[skeleton warrior]]s.

In [[1358 DR|Shou Year 2608 (1358 DR)]], the Black Leopard sent a [[bauh-yin]], one of his leopard-headed servants, to guide the adventuring party hired by [[Ko Ho San]] to the old well. If they did not attack the bauh-yin and explored the well, they would find the ivory figurine. Touching it would grant one a vision of its history, but awaken the skeleton warriors. If they retrieved the ivory figurine, it would aid them in their battle against the demon known as Dragon Claw, [[Lung Jua]].

==Destruction==
Some proposed means of destroying the ''Ivory Chain of Pao'' were as follows. One was to reform it using a secret way of joining each link whereby the hands could not touch. Another supposed that each link was associated with a living hero, and that if all were slain, then the ''Ivory Chain'' would crumble. Finally, it might be given to an [[elephant]] [[god]], who would smash the ivory.

==Notable Owners==
* The [[Nine Immortals]]
* [[Nan Kung Chi]], high priest of the Black Leopard Cult
