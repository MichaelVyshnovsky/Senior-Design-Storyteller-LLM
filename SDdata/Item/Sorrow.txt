'''''Sorrow''''' was a unique, [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[glaive]] that gradually twisted the [[soul]] of the wielder over time.

==Powers==
Every time the wielder of ''Sorrow'' wielded another creature with its place, their psyche became a little more fractured and damaged. It was said that every drop of blood tarnished their soul, a process that would continue until nothing else remained.

The wielder could use ''Sorrow'' to ''[[Ensnaring strike|magically ensnare]]'' their foe in a tangle of vines.

==History==
It was said to have once belonged to the "shade" of an individual, or perhaps a member of the [[shade]] species.{{Speculation}} It was taken from that individual around the time [[Ketheric Thorm]] was defeated, and the [[shadow curse]] spread outward from [[Moonrise Towers]].

As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Sorrow'' remained stored in a secret vault within the depths of the [[Emerald Grove]].
