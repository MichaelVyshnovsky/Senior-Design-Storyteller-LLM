A staff of stunning was an enchanted quarterstaff capable of knocking opponents unconscious.
A staff of stunning was usually made from yew.
It addition to making it easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponents during combat, a staff of striking also increased the chance that they would be knocked out. Targets remained unconscious for 3â€“12 minutes.
These staves were often seen being used by sailors on the Alamber Sea.
