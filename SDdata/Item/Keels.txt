'''''The Keels''''' were a pair of frightful-looking enchanted [[boots]] from [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''The Keels'' were somewhat crudely shaped sharp boots made of steel. These boots had some sentimental value as well as immense pride to their original owner, Calliope. She commissioned these boots, using steel fins salvaged from the ships she sank during her pirating career.

==Powers==
''The Keels''' appearance was intimidating enough by itself, but the boots were also imbued with the enchantment similar to a [[dragon]]'s ''frightful presence''. The wearer of ''the Keels'' could turn even the bravest warriors to fleeing.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Calliope]]: a [[bard]] adventurer who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
