The Keels were a pair of frightful-looking enchanted boots from Waterdeep circa the late 15 century DR.
The Keels were somewhat crudely shaped sharp boots made of steel. These boots had some sentimental value as well as immense pride to their original owner, Calliope. She commissioned these boots, using steel fins salvaged from the ships she sank during her pirating career.
The Keels appearance was intimidating enough by itself, but the boots were also imbued with the enchantment similar to a dragons frightful presence. The wearer of the Keels could turn even the bravest warriors to fleeing.
*Calliope a bard adventurer who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR.
