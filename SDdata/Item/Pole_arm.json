        "mainbody": "'''Pole arm''' or '''polearm''' was a term for an expansive variety of weaponry that all shared a common trait &mdash; the main fighting part of each weapon was mounted on generally a long straight shaft that would be wielded with two hands.{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|23}}",
        "Description": "Polearms varied widely in appearance. Their shafts were typically made of either some form of wood or metal. Some had special attachments to topple mounted targets. The main fighting part of polearms were such things as blades, spikes, [[axe]]heads, [[hammer]]heads, and other attacking implements. They would be mounted on either or both ends of the shaft. They were classified based upon what was the primary attacking implement of a weapon.<ref>{{Cite dragon/22/The Nomenclature of Pole Arms|54}}",
        "Weaponology": "[[File:Polearm Warfare.png|thumb|273px|''A platoon of soldiers use their polearms to hold back an advancing horde of [[monstrous humanoid]]s on [[horse]]back.'']]\nPolearms were relatively easy to wield and granted their users a longer reach, keeping them out of range from melee weaponry with a shorter reach, such as most [[sword]]s. When wielded by a skilled combatant they could become devastating weapons, with advantages over both axes and swords under many circumstances. The drawblacks of polearms included the space necessary to wield them, their weight, and their overall slowness.\n\nIn large groups or armies, polearms allowed their wielders to attack over the shoulders of the foremost or \"first rank\" attackers. And enabled the commanders of military units to contribute to the fighting while leading from behind.\n\nPolearms were frequently used against [[mount]]ed opponents. \n\nThere were a number of techniques one could learn that were unique to polearms. Such as \"sweeping\" their enemies, striking all within reach, by whirling their polearm around.{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|28}} \"Long striking\" by grasping the shaft further down then usual or shortening your grip to fight nearby opponents. And \"vaulting,\" meaning to use them to jump great distances.\n\nSome [[fighter]]s trained to become specialists in pole arms, becoming what was known as a [[polearm master]]",
        "Availability": "Generally speaking, polearms were easy to manufacture. Places in the Realms where one could purchase different varieties of polearms included:\n* In [[Athkatla]], the market [[Waukeen's Promenade]] sold all manner of polearms.<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"Duty\">''[[For Duty & Deity]]'' states that every nonmagical item from the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]'' can be purchased at Waukeen's Promenade.

        "History": "Polearms were a common variety of weapon among the people of [[Myth Drannor]]. They were a standard weapon among its [[Akh'Velahr|army's]] military elite, including its elite cavalry troops.\n\nIn ancient [[Netheril]], most varieties of polearms came into use around {{YearlinkConvert|2312|NY}}, with [[glaive]]s preceding them in {{YearlinkConvert|2171|NY}} and [[halberd]]s coming later in {{YearlinkConvert|2584|NY}}. The lance was never employed in that magic-rich empire, as the stirrup never came into use there. Nor was the mancatcher ever employed. Surrounding cultures, however, knew of the lance since ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|1300|NY}}.<ref>\n\nUp to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], polearms were largely unknown to the [[Chultan dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Chult]].\n\nIn [[1350 DR]], [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|King Azoun Obarskyer IV]] of [[Cormyr]] published a book on polearms entitled, ''[[Treatise on the History of Polearms in Warfare]]''.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}\n\n''Circa'' [[1360 DR]], during the [[First battle of the Golden Way]] the [[orc]] forces of [[Zhentil Keep]] were outfitted with a variety of polearms in addition to other weapons.\n\nSome time later in the 14{{th}} century DR, [[Alusair Obarskyr]] introduced [[Earthfast]]'s ruler [[Torg mac Cei]] to the use of polearms, particularly recommending Azoun's treatise on them. Torg would go on to train the soldiers of Earthfast in the use of polearms.",
        "Polearms in the Realms": {
            "Agricultural-Based": "[[File:Agricultural Polearms.png|thumb|273px|''A simple illustration of all polearms derived from agricultural tools.'']]\nA number of polearms were, or started out as, simple agricultural tools that had been adapted for use in warfare.\n* [[Bill-guisarme]]: a type of polearm that was derived from an agricultural tool known as the [[billhook]]. There many different designs for this weapon, but bill-guisarmes were generally similar in appearance to guisarmes. Unlike a guisarme, their sturdy hook's inside or \"concave\" edge (and sometimes its outside edge) was sharpened to be its cutting edge and their back spike was typically L-shaped, pointing forward.\n* [[Fauchard]]: a [[scythe]] that had been properly developed for the purposes of combat and warfare, rather than agricultural use.\n* [[Guisarme]]: a type of polearm that was derived from pruning hooks.{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|25}} with a sharp cutting edge along its convex side up to the point of the hook, much like a glaive. Their hook was proficient at pulling riders off their mounts. Later versions added a back spike which gave the guisarme another sharp point for sideways swinging and minor defensive capability.\n* [[Military fork]]: a type of polearm that was derived from [[pitchfork]]s. Their poles were mounted with two parallel spikes. Some had a blade mounted just below these spikes, in the crotch of the fork, so as to prevent opponents from safely going between the two main piercers. They lacked the penetrating power of spears, but were efficient at holding enemies at bay, and had a variety of secondary uses.\n* [[Voulge]]: a type of polearm that was derived from peasants mounting [[meat cleaver]]s on staves. They consisted of long stout staffs,",
            "Poleaxe Family": "'''Poleaxe''' was a term for any pole arm that had a pole mounted with any combination of axehead, beak, or hammerhead. Axeheads had two basic forms, broad and narrow. Narrow blades were often made thicker to adjust a weapon's weight, allowing the wielder to inflict more damage. The primary purpose of a poleaxe was to chop, though many also had spearheads to provide them some thrusting capability.\n* [[Bardiche]]: Also known as a '''berdysh''', were elongated [[battleaxe]]s with large, narrow curved heads attached to their shaft by a metal strap, typically [[iron]], with one or two rings. Those with a single ring had a shorter axehead and were backed with either a spike or hammerhead. They were a heavy and cumbersome poleaxe, with shafts shorter than halberds due to their weight. In the history of polearm development, they represented a transition stage between pole cleavers and other poleaxes. \n* [[Halberd]]: Polearms mounted with a concave, broad axehead set at an angle, with a fairly long spearhead on top and backed with a spike that was angled or hooked slightly downward. The rear spike was designed for piercing heavy [[plate armor]] and dismounting opponents. They required more room to wield than a spear.\n* Moonpole: A bardiche-like polearm that was used by members of the [[Order of the Half Moon]]. It sported a blade that was crescent-shaped in order to emulate [[Sel√ªne (moon)|the moon]].<ref>{{Cite comic/Selune Rising|15}}\n* [[Orc double axe]]: A type of polearm unique to orcs, these consisted of a pole mounted with two double-sided axeheads on both ends.\n* Voulge: Some considered this agricultural-based polearm to fall under this category.",
            "Spear Family": "[[File:Spears and Subtypes-1e.png|thumb|273px|''A simple illustration of various specialized [[spear]]s as well as differently shaped standard spears, [[lance]]s and [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]].'']]\n[[File:Spear types - A&EG.png|thumb|273px|''An illustration of an [[Pike (weapon)|awl pike]] and the heads of a [[glaive]], [[partisan]], [[ranseur]], and [[spetum]].'']]\n[[Spear]]s were one of the earliest types of pole arms, They were primarily used for thrusting, but could also be thrown. Experimentation with different spear heads over time lead to the development of many subtypes or \"specialized spears\" that had secondary capabilities. Though it should be noted that not all pole arms with spearheads were considered to be a type of spear, only those whose primary function was thrusting.\n*[[Barbed orc spear]]: A variety of spears that were developed by orcish smiths in the [[Sword Coast North]].\n*[[Javelin]]: A very versatile, light spear. Good for unleashing loose volleys upon an enemy force.\n* [[Lance]]: Spears with long shafts that were designed for use by cavalry, though there were some lighter varieties that could be wielded effectively by people on foot.\n* [[Partisan]]: A more defensive form of spear. Their heads were doubled-edged, with two diagonally-set flukes at the base.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Combo\">The partisan could possibly be considered a \"combination weapon,\" what with its small axeheads, but since its primary purpose is thrusting it's considered a member of the spear family. These flukes were axe-like spikes.\n* [[Pike (weapon)|Pike]]: also known as an '''awl pike''', were infantry spears with leaf-shaped heads and shafts that typically measured {{SIrange|16|22|ft}} in length. They were designed to do thrusting damage at relatively long range and keep opponents from closing the distance.\n* [[Ranseur]]: Spears similar to partisans, though less sturdy than them. They had three-pronged heads due to longer flukes. Their secondary blades were set further back from the central blade, backward-hooking, and were shaped and angled to deflect or better yet trap an enemy's weapon. The large central blade was indented at the base to facilitate entangling.\n* [[Ritiik]]: A type of bone-made spear that was used by the [[Iulutiun]]s for hunting. They had an additional hooked blade protruding from the base of their spear head.{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|26}}\n* [[Shakujo yari]]: Spears that were concealed within sheaths to look like [[staff]]s.\n* [[Spetum]]: Spears similar to ranseurs,{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|27}} though their shafts were generally shorter and sometimes their side blades angled backwards. Their secondary capability was deflecting attacks, as well as catching and holding foes at a distance.",
            "Special Cases": "There were a few weapons sometimes considered to be in the same general class as polearms due to their size, despite having designs that would be considered incongruent with what a \"true pole arm\" was. This included the agricultural tool [[threshing flail]], the [[heavy flail|weapon derived from it]], and the [[morningstar]]. The unique dwarven spear-axe known as the [[urgrosh]] was another weapon whose polearm status was debated.",
            "Combination Weapons": "[[File:Combination Weapons-1e.png|thumb|273px|''A simple illustration of various different combination weapons, as well as of the [[bec de corbin]] and [[lucerne hammer]].'']]\n[[File:Combination Weapons-2e.png|thumb|273px|''An illustration of the heads of various combination weapons.'']]\nOver time as people sought to improve upon the designs of pole arms, either to mitigate weaknesses or enhance their strengths, a new classification was developed.\n* '''Fauchard-fork''': A type of polearm whose design was derived from both fauchards and forks. Unlike a fauchard their blade's cutting edge was on the convex side (facing the opponent) and curved more like a [[sickle]]. And much like a gardening fork they had two flukes, which either projected from the blade or tipped the pole end.\n* '''Fauchard-guisarme''': Also known as a '''hooked-fauchard''', were fauchards that had a heavy hook attached to the back of their blade that one could use to dismount their opponents.\n* '''Glaive-guisarme''': Glaives that had two flukes mounted on the back of their blades, in a similar fashion to a guisarme.\n* '''Guisarme-voulge''': Guisarmes with a curved axehead, similar to a voulge, but with a rear hook-shaped fluke formed from its blade, rather than being added separately.",
            "Miscellaneous": "[[File:Group of Polearms (2) 2nd edition.png|thumb|273px]]\nThe last broad category of polearms were those that lacked any true classification, specialized weaponry that couldn't fall neatly under any of the aforementioned classifications.\n* [[Goblin stick]]: A type of hooked and forked polearm that was developed by [[bugbear]]s to aid in the capture of evasive goblins.\n* [[Gythka]]: A polearm invented and used by the [[thri-kreen]]. These had a crescent-shaped blade mounted on each end of the shaft.\n* [[Bec de corbin]]: A type of polearm similar to a lucerne hammer, but with a spike tip that was much shorter and broader. While some had a four-pronged head like the lucerne hammer, others had a flat hammerhead or even an axehead. And further unlike the latter weapon, the part primarily used for attacking was the spike tip.\n* [[Entangling pole]]: Also known as a '''sleeve tangler''' or a '''sodegarami''' in Kara-Tur, was a type of highly specialized polearm that was designed to catch and entangle an opponent without causing them great harm.<ref>\n* [[Lajatang]]: A type of polearm that was unique to the land of Kara-tur. These had a crescent shaped-blade on both ends of the pole.\n* [[Lucerne hammer]]: A type of polearm similar to a halberd, They had long poles, but were mounted with a smaller three or four-pronged hammerhead instead of an axehead, along with a spike atop the hammer and at its rear. They were designed to pierce heavy armor.\n* [[Mancatcher]]: A type of polearm that originated in the land of Kara-Tur. These consisted of two parallel prongs that were curved to encircle a [[humanoid]] creature. They had both spikes and sharpened edges on their concave side.\n* [[Pincer staff]]: A type of polearm that was similar in design to the mancatcher, but unique to [[kuo-toa]].\n* [[Snap-tong]]: A type of polearm that was unique to [[rutterkin]].\n* [[Tetsubo]]: A type of polearm unique to the land of Kara-Tur.
