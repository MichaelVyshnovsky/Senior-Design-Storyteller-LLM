'''''The Nightthief's Nimbleknife''''' was an enchanted [[dagger]] that once belonged to an infamous [[Sembia]]n [[Assassin]] only known as the [[Nightthief]].

==Powers==
The ''Nimbleknife'' was weak offensively, but its enchantments granted the weapon's user the boon of [[ambidexterity]] and improved their battle tumble skill.

==History==
''The Nightthief's Nimbleknife'' was first seen in the hands of the Nightthief, a Sembian assassin renowned for fighting with two daggers. The ''Nimbleknife'' was not used for its damage but rather for its enchantments that improved the assassin's performance in battle. On one occasion, a Sembian merchant with a vendetta against the Nightthief laid an ambush for the assassin. Unfortunately, this resulted in all twelve warriors in the merchant's employ dead and the bait, a {{SI|2|lb|k|long=yes}} [[diamond]] - gone.

''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], the ''Nimbleknife'' has long left its notorious owners hands and found its way to the [[Moonsea]] region. Its new owner was [[Zain]], a spy and an [[assassin]] in service of the ruler of [[Hillsfar]].
