        "mainbody": "'''Myconid soup''' was an accidental culinary discovery of [[Geldorf Tinbasher]], a stern [[dwarf|dwarven]] chef from [[Thay]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Mmmmmm, smell that! Hard to believe such an amazing scent comes from such an 'orrible creature.''|[[Geldorf Tinbasher|Geldorf \"The Cook\" Tinbasher]]}}",
        "Description": "Myconid soup was prepared by slowly simmering diced myconid flesh in a light stock for the duration of an entire day. The soup was lightly seasoned with [[salt]] before serving. Geldorf swore it was the best soup one could have.",
        "History": "Chef Tinbasher accidentally discovered the recipe after an acquaintance of his procured a chunk of [[myconid]] flesh for Geldorf to cook with as a joke. Ironically, the chef fell in love with the soup he created and was on an almost obsessive quest to get a piece of myconid known as [[the Concocter]] during his time working for [[Dennaton]]'s gladiatorial pits in Thay ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]."
