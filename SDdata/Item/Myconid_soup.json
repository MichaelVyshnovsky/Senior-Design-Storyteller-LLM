        "mainbody": "yconid soup was an accidental culinary discovery of Geldorf Tinbasher, a stern dwarven chef from Thay, active in the 14 century DR.\nMyconid soup was prepared by slowly simmering diced myconid flesh in a light stock for the duration of an entire day. The soup was lightly seasoned with salt before serving. Geldorf swore it was the best soup one could have.\nChef Tinbasher accidentally discovered the recipe after an acquaintance of his procured a chunk of myconid flesh for Geldorf to cook with as a joke. Ironically, the chef fell in love with the soup he created and was on an almost obsessive quest to get a piece of myconid known as the Concocter during his time working for Dennatons gladiatorial pits in Thay circa 1369 DR."
