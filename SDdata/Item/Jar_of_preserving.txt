A '''''jar of preserving''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[jar]] that allowed for one to preserve any type of material indefinitely.

==Description==
These jars were round in shape and made of [[glass]], with glass lids that screwed into place. They could hold up to {{SI|1|cbft|long=yes}} of material.

==Powers==
A ''jar of preserving'' put any type of material or small creature that was placed within it into a state of suspended animation. This meant that any plant matter would never wilt or rot; creatures would never age, hunger, or thirst; and [[spell component]]s would never lose their potency.

==History==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[nabassu]] active in [[Ravens Bluff]] hired a [[thief]] by the name of Sir [[FM Lillywhite]] to get together a group of [[adventurer]]s to retrieve a famous and sacred [[teapot]], known as the ''[[Holy Container of Wisdom]]'', that he'd recently obtained information on.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tempest in a Tea Pot|4}} Lillywhite offered the adventurers a [[pouch]] of 60 [[platinum piece]]s, a jar containing six ''[[air spores]]'', and even a ''jar of preserving'' if they agreed to hand over to him the sacred teapot.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tempest in a Tea Pot|7}}

==Notable Owners==
* These magical jars were a common magical item among [[necromancer]]s.<ref>
