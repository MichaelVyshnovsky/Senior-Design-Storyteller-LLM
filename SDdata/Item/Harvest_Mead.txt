'''Harvest Mead''', later known as '''Harbor Mead''' or '''Dragon Mead''', was a traditional alcoholic beverage from the village of [[West Harbor]] on the edge of the [[Mere of Dead Men]], served cold annually during the [[Harvest Festival]].

{{quote|''I've got something to make it worth your while, though - Harvest Mead. Old family recipe - used to be shipped all over the Sword Coast before West Harbor got burnt the first time. If you're selling, guaranteed folks will buy. ''|[[Lazlo Buckman]]}}

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], [[Lazlo Buckman]] served his famous Harvest Mead during that year's Harvest Festival, notably to the [[Kalach-Cha]], before the village was attacked under cover of night by [[duergar]]s and [[bladeling]]s searching for shards of the ''[[Silver Sword of Gith]]''.
