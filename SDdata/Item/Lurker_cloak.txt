A lurker cloak was a cloak that allowed the wearer to turn into a lurker.
A lurker cloak was a mottled gray cloak that almost looked like it was made out of stone or black like jet that was measured for elves including drow. They wore it like a long cloak. Humans and other bigger creatures of up to 9 ft (2.7 m) could wear it as a short cloak.
There were two versions of lurker cloak. One version allowed the wearer of a lurker cloak could polymorph once per day into a lurker for two hours. The other allowed the wearer to polymorph into a lurker only for seven minutes but twice per day. In the form of a lurker, the user had a better chance to get the drop on their enemies in stony, underground environments due to the lurker forms coloration.
The user who transformed him or herself into a lurker could be ridden. This was potentially dangerous for both the user and the rider. The reason for this was that a polymorphed lurker could not stay aloft when someone was riding it and started to descend as it advanced, eventually crashing to the ground. This limited flight to falling from cliffs and the like and required a special maneuver for landing that was not necessarily completely safe for both parties.
Lurker cloaks were magic items associated with the drow.
