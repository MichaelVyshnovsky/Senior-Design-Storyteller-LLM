        "Powers": "Whoever held this charm felt they were strangely powerful. When the charm was snapped in two, it unleashed a collection of [[spell]]s on the owner: ''[[bear's endurance]]'', ''[[bull's strength]]'', ''[[cat's grace]]'', '[[eagle's splendor]]'', ''[[fox's cunning]]'', and ''[[owl's wisdom]]''.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the kindly herbalist woman who inhabited the [[Riverside Teahouse]] in the [[Sunlit Wetlands]] – [[Auntie Ethel]], was a [[green hag]] who wore a [[human]] guise. One of these bone charms was a creation of her [[hag]] magics. Ethel was willing to part with the charm as a gift to those adventurers who would not attempt to take from the hag the young woman named [[Mayrina]] and her unborn baby."
