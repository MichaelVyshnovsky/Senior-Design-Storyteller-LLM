A '''''skin of pouring''''' was a [[waterskin]] enchanted with the [[pluma]] [[spell]] ''[[create talisman]]''.

==Description==
The exterior of these waterskins was feathered.

==Powers==
The enchantment placed upon a ''skin of pouring'' ensured that it was always full of clean drinking water. Water could be poured from the skin at a rate of {{SI|1|gal|c|long=yes}} per minute.

==Notable Users==
* [[Sozarro]], a deserter from the [[Golden Legion]], traded a magic [[sword]] for a ''skin of pouring'' so he wouldn't die of thirst whilst crossing the [[Pasocada Basin]].<ref>
