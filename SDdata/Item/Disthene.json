        "mainbody": "Disthene, also known as kyanite, was a plentiful ornamental stone found across the Realms.\nDisthene cleaved easily but was difficult to facet-cut because it was prone to splitting in unwanted directions. \nThis stone could easily be cleaved making it difficult to cut in facets without splitting. Flawless disthene was difficult to find but came in crystals ranging in color from pale green to dark blue.\nDisthene was crushed to powder and used as a material component in, or to make inks for inscribing scrolls of, spells that controlled and shaped fire."
