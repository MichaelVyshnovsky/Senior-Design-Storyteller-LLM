        "mainbody": "The '''''Giant Killer''''' was an enchanted [[halfling]] [[sling]] effective against [[giant]]s.",
        "Powers": "The ''Giant Killer'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and, when wielded against [[giant]]s and [[giant-kin]], it effectively became a ''+4'' magic weapon.",
        "History": "The first known wielder of the ''Giant Killer'' was a [[halfling]] shire-reeve [[warrior]] named [[Kim Marchwatch]]. The halfling used the sling against the giants who menaced his home. Marchwatch pelleted them with so many rocks that the giants either fell over or fled the onslaught. Subsequently, Kim was replaced as the shire-reeve and was forced on the road becoming an adventurer. He and his enchanted sling were believed to be consumed by the dreaded [[Fen Mists of Acallo]] in [[760 DR]].\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], the ''Giant Killer'' found its way into the stock of [[Conlan]], the proprietor of [[Kuldahar]]'s blacksmith shop."
