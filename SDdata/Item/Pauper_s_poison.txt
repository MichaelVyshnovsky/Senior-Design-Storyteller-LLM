Paupers poison was a poison extracted from creatures native to the Nelanther Isles or the waters in that region. It was harvested by pirates and sold to merchants in Skullport and Waterdeep.
This cloudy, sweet-tasting, white liquid could be mixed in a drink of water or alcohol for ingesting. A single dose typically cost 40 gp.
This relatively weak poison had no immediate affect on a victim, but they soon began to feel like they had fallen off a cart and been kicked by a mule.
Elsk Thavarask, the proprietor of the Missing Minotaur tavern in Everlund, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, was known to use this substance to dampen the exuberance of customers that couldnt handle their liquor. He sometimes sold it to people he trusted.
