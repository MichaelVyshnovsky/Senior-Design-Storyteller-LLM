'''Pauper's poison''' was a [[poison]] extracted from creatures native to the [[Nelanther Isles]] or the waters in that region. It was harvested by [[pirate]]s and sold to merchants in [[Skullport]] and [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
This cloudy, sweet-tasting, white liquid could be mixed in a drink of water or alcohol for ingesting. A single dose typically cost 40 gp.

==Effects==
This relatively weak poison had no immediate affect on a victim, but they soon began to feel like they had fallen off a cart and been kicked by a [[mule]].

==Notable Users==
[[Elsk Thavarask]], the proprietor of the [[Missing Minotaur]] tavern in [[Everlund]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], was known to use this substance to dampen the exuberance of customers that couldn't handle their liquor. He sometimes sold it to people he trusted.
