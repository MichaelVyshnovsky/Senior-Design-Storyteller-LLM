The robe of the Watcher was a set of enchanted robes that originated from the drow city of Rilauven.
These robes were bestowed upon whichever mage from Rilauven that demonstrated the greatest command over divination magic within the citys sorcerous academy.
The robe of the Watcher bolstered the wearers physical defenses, their inherent magical resistance, and protected against spells cast against them. They also rendered the wearer nondetectible by magical means, and shielded them from the stupefying gaze of umber hulks.
* Malavon Despana, archmage of Rilauven and patron of House Despana.
