        "Description": "This item appeared as a seal with letters carved deeply into its surface.",
        "Powers": "If pressed against someone's palm, the seal would mark them with a magical imprint. The mark was invisible but did radiate magic and could be seen by casting a ''[[detect invisibility]]'' spell. A person could only be marked once.\n\nWith this mark a person could attempt to alter the fate of any outcome to their favor. Each time the seal was used there was a chance that it would disappear forever.",
