The Absolutes warboard was a magical shield bearing the mark of the Absolute.
This large shield was made of wood and had several nails tacked onto it. Despite seeming like a simple rustic shield, it was actually enchanted.
When this shield was equipped and its powers were invoked, the wearers armor was magically increased as per the shield of faith spell. However, unlike the spell itself, the shield would cause the wielder to remain imbued with magical armor until they rested (instead of just a few minutes). The powers could be reactivated following a short rest.
