The '''''Absolute's warboard''''' was a [[magic]]al [[shield]] bearing the mark of [[the Absolute]].

==Description==
This large shield was made of wood and had several nails tacked onto it. Despite seeming like a simple rustic shield, it was actually enchanted.

==Powers==
When this shield was equipped and its powers were invoked, the wearer's armor was magically increased as per the ''[[shield of faith]]'' [[spell]]. However, unlike the spell itself, the shield would cause the wielder to remain imbued with magical armor until they rested (instead of just a few minutes). The powers could be reactivated following a short rest.

==Notable Owners==
* High Priestess [[Gut]], a [[True Soul]].
