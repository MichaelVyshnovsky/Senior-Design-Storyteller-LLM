        "Powers": "The magical bubbles created by this staff measured {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in diameter and could be directed to move by the bearer. Each individual sphere could contain up to {{SI|140|lb|k|long=yes}} of matter. Exceeding this weight limit caused the sphere to cease to exist, along with anything contained within, including living matter. Piercing a sphere with any point would also destroy it.\n\nAny living creature within a sphere enjoyed the benefits of a ''[[feather fall]]'' [[spell]]. The spheres did not serve as cages and any creature within a sphere could leave at any time.",
        "History": "The ''staff of spheres'' was originally created by [[Elminster]] in [[Myth Drannor]]."
