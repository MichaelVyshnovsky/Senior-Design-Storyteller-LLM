Each individual sphere could contain up to  of matter. Exceeding this weight limit caused the sphere to cease to exist, along with anything contained within, including living matter. Piercing a sphere with any point would also destroy it.\nAny living creature within a sphere enjoyed the benefits of a feather fall spell. The spheres did not serve as cages and any creature within a sphere could leave at any time.\nThe staff of spheres was originally created by Elminster in Myth Drannor."
