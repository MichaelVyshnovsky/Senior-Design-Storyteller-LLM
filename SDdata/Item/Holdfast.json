        "mainbody": "'''''Holdfast''''' was a type of powerful [[enchanted]] jewelry of the [[aquatic elven]] making.",
        "Powers": "''Holdfast'' [[amulet]]s were created to be used in hunt and to neutralize invaders. The wearer of the necklace was completely unaffected by ''[[hold person]]'' spells and similar effects. The same spell could be cast by the wearer twice per day, while more powerful variation – ''[[hold monster]]'', once per day.",
        "History": "Even though these enchanted amulets were created in the ages past by the [[sea elves]], the jewelry remained quite rare in the land kingdoms. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, two ''Holdfast'' amulets could be found in the treasure hoard of twin [[black dragon]]s of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] – [[Voaraghamanthar‎]] and [[Waervaerendor‎]]."
