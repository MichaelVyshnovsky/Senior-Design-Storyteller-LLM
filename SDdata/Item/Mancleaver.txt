A mancleaver was a distinctive and lightweight battleaxe wielded by some warriors of the Many-Arrows orcs during their occupation of the Tower District of Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.
These axes were adorned with orcish runes representing despair. The blood of the orcs enemies was known to be left smeared on the weapon.
The warband leader Kartok Paingiver was rumored to wield a mancleaver.
