        "Powers": "This [[flail]] held a ''+4'' enchantment and was imbued with ''[[negative energy]]''. The weapon's hammer could easily smash through bones with its massive critical hits.",
        "History": "Banelich Shrazgul infamously wielded this dreadful weapon against the enemies of the [[Church of Bane]] and even the fellow Banites when the lich deemed them guilty of supposed slights against him. Shrazgul named the weapon ''the Black Lord's Caress'' in pious attempts to honor his dark deity. However, that did not stop the god from imprisoning him when the banelich became wayward and hard to control. In [[1135 DR]], ''the Black Lord's Caress'' was considered lost after its owner's disappeared from the Realms.\n\nThe weapon resurfaced in [[1373 DR]], found under the town of [[Voonlar]], inside its deep catacombs dedicated to recently resurrected god Bane."
