        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of teleportation''''' was a [[magic item]] that allowed the wearer to ''[[teleport]]''.",
        "Description": "These rings were fitted with a deep blue [[gem]] worth 500 [[gp]].",
        "Powers": "The user separated the gem from the ring and placed it in a location of their choosing, allowing them to ''[[teleport without error]]'' to that location by expending one of the ring's charges. If the location of the gem was unsafe in any way then the ring expended four charges but nothing happened. The gem could be moved to a new location at any time.\n\nThese rings had 3â€“30 charges.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Nisstyre]], captain of the [[Dragon's Hoard]] mercenary company of [[Ched Nasad]].\n* [[Random Riellor]], the world-traveling [[necromancer]] from [[Halruaa]], wore a ''ring of teleportation''."
