If the location of the gem was unsafe in any way then the ring expended four charges but nothing happened. The gem could be moved to a new location at any time.\nThese rings had 3â€“30 charges.\n* Nisstyre, captain of the Dragons Hoard mercenary company of Ched Nasad.\n* Random Riellor, the world-traveling necromancer from Halruaa, wore a ring of teleportation."
