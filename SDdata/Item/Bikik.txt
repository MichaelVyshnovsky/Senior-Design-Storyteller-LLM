A bikik was a type of sled used on the Great Glacier.
The bikik was similar to a traditional dog sled, but featured a square sail measuring  on each side. The sail was securely fastened to a mast positioned near the center of the sleds frame. Crafted from durable materials such as caribou hide or seal skin, the sail harnessed the power of the wind, enhancing the speed and efficiency of the sleds movement.
