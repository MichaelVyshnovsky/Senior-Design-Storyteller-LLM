A '''bikik''' was a type of sled used on the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
The bikik was similar to a traditional [[dog sled]], but featured a square sail measuring {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} on each side. The sail was securely fastened to a mast positioned near the center of the sled's frame. Crafted from durable materials such as [[caribou]] hide or [[seal]] skin, the sail harnessed the power of the wind, enhancing the speed and efficiency of the sled's movement.
