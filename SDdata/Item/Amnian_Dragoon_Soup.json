        "mainbody": "'''Amnian Dragoon Soup''' was a dish from the nation of [[Amn]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]].\n{{quote|''Something from my mother's mother.''|[[Dradeel]]}}",
        "Description": "The recipe called for four [[cup]]s of [[beef broth]]; eight cups of water; two finely sliced [[leek]]s; two sliced [[carrot]]s; a single thinly sliced stalk of [[celery]]; a small head of [[cabbage]], finely shredded; one chopped [[onion]]; one minced [[garlic]] clove; two [[lemon]]s; and four [[egg]]s.\n\nThe simple [[soup]] recipe required a large [[pot]] in which broth and water were combined, and vegetables added, bringing it to a gentle boil. On lower flames, the soup was then simmered and covered for an hour and a half, adding water if needed and skimming the scum from the top. Lastly, the lemons were juiced, and the juice was added to the soup, followed by beaten eggs carefully mixed in. Then, after seasoning and two or three more minutes of stirring, the soup was ready to be served.",
        "History": "The recipe for Amnian Dragoon Soup was recorded in Dradeel's recipe book during his accommodations within the [[Spellhold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. The recipe came from the man's grandmother."
