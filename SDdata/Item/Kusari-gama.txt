A '''kusari-gama''' ({{Pronounce|koo|sah|ree|gah|mah|refs=}}) was a weapon unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The kusari-gama evolved from the traditional [[kama]] and was specifically designed for combat purposes. It consisted of a kama blade with a length of weighted [[chain]] attached to the handle's butt end. The weapon offered several versatile applications. The wielder could wield the kama for direct attacks, employ the weighted chain for clubbing and entangling maneuvers, or spin the kama at the chain's end for a whirlwind effect. Its relative simplicity in construction made it a popular choice for both peasants and [[ninja]]s.
