Cloaks of protection versus chaos were enchanted protective cloaks created by Taern "Thunderspell" Hornblade sometime before 1372 DR.
Cloaks of protection versus chaos functioned in similar fashion to +2 cloaks of protection when facing creatures and individuals of chaotic nature.
Cloaks of protection versus chaos were fashioned by Taern "Thunderspell" Hornblade of Silverymoon in preparation to an assault  by a deadly and chaotic orc army of the north. These magic cloaks were given out to rangers and fighters who stood agains the horde.
By 1372 DR, many of these enchanted pieces of fabric left Silverymoon and found themselves in the hands of various inhabitants of the Sword Coast.
