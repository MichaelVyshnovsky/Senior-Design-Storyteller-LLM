        "mainbody": "'''''Gravemaster's habit''''' was an enchanted [[robe]] to be used by a [[lich]], designed sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Gravemaster's habits'' were thoroughly enchanted and intricately sown to be the most prized possessions of [[Thayan]] liches. These robes boosted the wearer's vitality, increased their defense, aim, and strengthened their life-stealing magics. When in battle, the robe ensured the wearer could easily land the most critical and lucky of attacks within the first two minutes.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] dispatched agents to the [[Jungles of Chult]] as the dangerous [[death curse]] began spreading across [[Faer√ªn]]. ''Gravemaster's habit'' was one of the rare pieces of enchanted gear brought to Chult by [[Szass Tam]]'s [[mage]]s and his [[undead]] servants."
