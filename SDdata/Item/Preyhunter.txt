Unlike many other crossbows, Inshulas Preyhunter dealt significantly more piercing damage, and the force of impact dealt additional bludgeoning harm. The weapons +1 enchantment made what crossbow impossible to handle by anyone who was not a human ranger.
In the , the Preyhunter accompanied Inshula on her travels from Tashluta to the jungles of Samarach and working with the Sword Coast adventurers for the merchant SaSani of Samargol.
