        "Powers": "The ''gloves of the artificer'' and their more powerful versions, ''greater gloves of the artificer'', enchanted the wearer's skills that were associated with artificers, such as crafting traps.",
        "History": "Even though the true origins of these enchanted gloves were unknown, it was believed that they were created by Halaster Blackcloak to help him with countless and devious traps of Undermountain, or that was what merchants of [[Waterdeep]] were claiming. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these gloves were used and sold by the [[cleric]]s of [[Gond]] from [[the Purple Portals]] of [[Melvaunt]]."
