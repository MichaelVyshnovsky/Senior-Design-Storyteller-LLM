        "mainbody": "Gloves of the artificer were enchanted gloves that helped tinkerers and trappers that were rumored to be created by Halaster Blackcloak of Undermountain.\nThe gloves of the artificer and their more powerful versions, greater gloves of the artificer, enchanted the wearers skills that were associated with artificers, such as crafting traps.\nEven though the true origins of these enchanted gloves were unknown, it was believed that they were created by Halaster Blackcloak to help him with countless and devious traps of Undermountain, or that was what merchants of Waterdeep were claiming. By the late 14 century DR, these gloves were used and sold by the clerics of Gond from the Purple Portals of Melvaunt."
