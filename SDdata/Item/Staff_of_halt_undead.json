        "mainbody": "Staff of halt undead was an enchanted staff favored by both enemies and puppeteers of the undead.\nThese staves appeared to be unassuming cracked and withered walking sticks.\nThese staves allowed the wielder to cast a potent version of the halt undead spell. On average, these staves possessed three charges.\nIn 1369 DR, one of the staves of halt undead was in possession of a wizard of the Cult of the Dragon found on the top level of the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor."
