        "Description": "''Canaith mandolins'' were 8-string mandolins. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by [[bard]]s, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.",
        "Powers": "Bards wielding a ''Canaith mandolin'' had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.\n\nLike all Instruments of the Bards, these mandolins had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a ''Canaith mandolin'' could invoke the spells ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[Protection from evil|protection from evil and good]]'', ''[[cure wounds]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'' and ''[[Protection from energy|protection from lightning]]'' each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.",
        "History": "The first ''Canaith mandolins'' were created by a legendary bard in the [[Moonshae Isles]] named [[Falataer]]. He used them to test and reward the students of the Canaith level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.\n\nOver time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor."
