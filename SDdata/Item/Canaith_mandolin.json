        "mainbody": "A Canaith mandolin (|audio=Canaith.ogg) was a masterwork magic mandolin and one of the Instruments of the Bards.\nCanaith mandolins were 8-string mandolins. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.\nBards wielding a Canaith mandolin had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.\nLike all Instruments of the Bards, these mandolins had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a Canaith mandolin could invoke the spells fly, invisibility, levitate, protection from evil and good, cure wounds, dispel magic and protection from lightning each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.\nThe first Canaith mandolins were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer. He used them to test and reward the students of the Canaith level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.\nOver time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataers honor."
