'''Hand mirrors''' were an easily transportable variety of [[mirror]] in the Realms that had a variety of uses.

==Description==
Typical hand mirrors carried by adventurers were usually made of polished [[steel]]. Specially constructed ornate hand mirrors made of [[silver]]ed glass were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. These special versions had a loop at the handle that allowed them to be attached to belts.

Small mirrors with handles were essential components of [[thieves' tools]].

==Powers==
A hand mirror was the [[material component]] of the ''[[wall of light]]'' [[spell]].
