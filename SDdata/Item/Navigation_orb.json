        "mainbody": "A '''''navigation orb''''' was a massive, spherical device used by [[cloud giant]]s to navigate their flying castles.",
        "Description": "An orb was constructed as a sphere of burnished [[mithral]], {{SIAdj|7|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, inscribed with the ''[[cloud (rune)|skye]]'' [[rune]] in the [[giant language]]. It would remain aloft in the air, floating about {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} above ground level.",
        "Powers": "Each ''navigation orb'' was linked to a specific cloud giant castle. When kept within a castle, an individual could discern its orientation to the ground below and change its altitude or direction in which it traveled.\n\nIf an orb was removed from within or somehow destroyed, the cloud giant castle to which it was linked would remain stuck in a fixed location.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Zephyros]], an eccentric cloud giant [[wizard]], used a ''navigation orb'' to control his [[Tower of Zephyros|wizard-hat-shaped tower]]."
