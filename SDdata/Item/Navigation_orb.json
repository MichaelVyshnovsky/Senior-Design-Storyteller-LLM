        "mainbody": "A navigation orb was a massive, spherical device used by cloud giants to navigate their flying castles.\nAn orb was constructed as a sphere of burnished mithral,  in diameter, inscribed with the skye rune in the giant language. It would remain aloft in the air, floating about  above ground level.\nEach navigation orb was linked to a specific cloud giant castle. When kept within a castle, an individual could discern its orientation to the ground below and change its altitude or direction in which it traveled.\nIf an orb was removed from within or somehow destroyed, the cloud giant castle to which it was linked would remain stuck in a fixed location.\n* Zephyros, an eccentric cloud giant wizard, used a navigation orb to control his wizard-hat-shaped tower."
