        "mainbody": "'''''Potions of dragonbreath''''' were magical concoctions that could simulate the infamous and dangerous fiery [[dragon breath|breath]] of a [[dragon]]. In the post-[[Spellplague]] era these potions came in a wider variety, simulating the range of breaths characteristic of [[chromatic dragon]]s.",
        "Description": "These small red [[potion]]s were hot and fiery in appearance and taste.",
        "Powers": "When consumed, the magics of these potions allowed the drinker to produce a huge gout of hot burning flames out of their mouth. The flames were similar to those of an actual dragon and similar to the effects of the ''[[dragon's breath]]'' spell.\n\nIn the post-[[Spellplague]] era, in addition to huge gouts of hot burning flames an imbiber could breath a gout of searing [[acid]], freezing cold, [[poison]]ous gas, or streaks of lightning.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]], who feuded with a [[lizardman]] [[shaman]] [[Uzzak-Szalzik]], possessed a rich collection of magic potions, tinctures, and brews. Among them were ''potions of dragonbreath'' of her own creation. These potions were available to any of the [[green hag]]'s allies against her sworn lizardfolk enemy."
