        "mainbody": "oarding arrows were enchanted projectiles used by sailors and pirates of the Nelanther Isles and the Sea of Swords.\nThese arrows were enchanted to teleport the shooter towards the target upon a successful hit. Additionally, these arrows dazed creatures they struck.\nSometime before the , the first boarding arrows were created by a half-elven pirate named Darius Gulch who got frustrated with his crew getting tangled up in the rigging when boarding enemy ships. Darius used his booty to commission special enchantments weaved onto arrows to outfit his crew with. Ironically enough, Dariuss buccaneers death rate remained high as they kept on teleporting into a crowd of armed enemy sailors.\nBoarding arrows were in common use in the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale."
