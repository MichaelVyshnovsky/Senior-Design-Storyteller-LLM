Backstabber was the enchanted short sword that belonged to the young daredevil rogue Tudo circa 1369 DR.
Backstabbers blade was of jet black color and was significantly slimmer than other short swords.
Backstabber was beautifully balanced, allowing the wielder to land hits with this weapon much easier than with another short sword. This slender blade also had a +2 enchantment and increased the users dexterity.
Backstabber belonged to a young rogue Tudo who, won a dare, traveled from Hillsfar to Myth Drannor to bring back a piece of Castle Cormanthor in 1369 DR. He was spotted and imprisoned by the Cult of the Dragon deep in the Castles prisons. Backstabber along with his master worked to bring down the Cults operation after they were rescued from the prison cell.
