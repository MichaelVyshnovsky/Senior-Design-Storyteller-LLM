        "mainbody": "The Sword of Selvetarm was an intelligent holy sword of Selvetarms church.\nThe swords properties changed depending on who wielded it. Its true potential was only usable by evil drow.\nIn the hands of an evil person, who wasnt a drow, it worked as a simple +2 longsword. The swords intelligence tried to dominate the non-drow wielder into working for Lolth and Selvetarm.\nIn the hands of any person who wasnt evil, the sword was outright dangerous. It stunted the wielders vitality, killing those too weak, which was impossible to restore as long as the owner clung to the sword.\nIn the hands of an evil drow, the sword showed its true potential. It worked as a +5 elf bane unholy vorpal longsword with a large amount of additional powers bestowed on the user, both physical and magical.\nOn the physical side, the sword heightened the wielders agility and abilities to hide. Furthermore, the wielder could rage like a barbarian.\nOn the magical side, the sword allowed the casting of spider climb and web as often as the user wanted and of fire spider once every day. Once per month, the user could summon a yochlol, who opened a channel to commune with Lolth or Selvetarm.\nThe Sword of Selvetarm was an intelligent weapon. It couldnt actually talk, barring telepathy, but it could shout Selvetarms name during any battle.\nIt generally hated to be not used in a battle and actively urged its owner to enter the fray.\nThe sword was created by Selvetarm, the drow demigod of warriors. The Sword of Selvetarm was created as a tool to promote Lolths agenda,\nIt was a longsword instead of a heavy mace like his actual favored weapon, because it was made to strengthen that branch of drow warriors, that trained in the usage of two-handed weapons.\nBy 1372 DR, the sword was lost for decades but its recovery was believed to be a matter of time.\nThe sword was difficult to destroy. The only way to destroy it was to bring it into the Demonweb Pits and hurt either Lolth or Selvetarm with it."
