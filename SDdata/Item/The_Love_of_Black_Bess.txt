The Love of Black Bess was a unique enchanted mace dedicated to the Lady of Misfortune, Beshaba.
The Love of Black Bess was enhanced with a powerful +3 enchantment as well as Beshabas divine magics of bad luck. Each successful hit had a chance of taking away the targets luck. Additionally, the maces creator attached a ring of readiness to the Black Bess. The owner of its twin ring could summon the mace to fly into their hands with a simple command.
Redani, a cruel mage who worshiped Beshaba and lived sometime before the , was the creator of The Love of Black Bess. Redani was known for two things her arcane prowess, and her skills of seduction. The magical mace was a regular gift to the womans new consorts. Every time Redani grew tired of a lover, she gave a new consort the ring of readiness and sent him to slay the predecessor. New paramours always slew their mark with ease. A single word sent The Love of Black Bess flying out of the old lovers hands and into the new ones. Ultimately, Redanis death came from a priest of Hoar, the god of poetic justice. The said priest was Gural of Chessenta, who came across a skull of one of Redanis ex-lovers felled by The Love of Black Bess and embarked on a quest to bring justice to the Beshaban wizardess. Gural animated all of the consorts slain by Redani, ending her cruel existence.
The Love of Black Bess changed hands over time before ending up in possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar by 1281 DR.
