        "mainbody": "Warming lamps were devices that worked both as a form of lamp and as warming aids.\nA typical warming lamp consisted of a spherical fist-sized iron container that could hold hot coals. It had small vents that allowed an air flow for the coals to safely burn and provide heat. Once loaded, they could be placed in beds to warm them or as heat sources for comfort.\nWarming lamps were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nAdditionally to their heating properties, warming lamps could also be used as small beacons for creatures with infravision."
