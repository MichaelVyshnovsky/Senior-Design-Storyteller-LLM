Shields of purity were ancient enchanted shields that granted their wielders strong magical and mundane defenses.
These large-sized shields were made of polished white metal.
Apart from possessing a +3 enchantment to their armor, these shields of purity improved the wearers reactions, defenses, and resistances to effects both mundane and of magical nature.
Sometime before the advent of the Weeping War and fall of Myth Drannor, Shyla of Damara was interred in one of the older and deeper levels of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor among other heroes of the City of Song. She was laid to rest with her shield of purity. Her grave remained undisturbed as of 1369 DR. If the shield were to be removed from Shylas sarcophagus, her angry wraith was sure to seek vengeance.
Another such shield was looted from another grave in the Elven Catacombs in 1369 DR, by a wizard of the Cult of the Dragon.
