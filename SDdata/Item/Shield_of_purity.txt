'''''Shields of purity''''' were ancient [[enchanted]] [[shield]]s that granted their wielders strong magical and mundane defenses.

==Description==
These large-sized shields were made of polished white metal.

==Powers==
Apart from possessing a ''+3'' enchantment to their armor, these ''shields of purity'' improved the wearer's reactions, defenses, and resistances to effects both mundane and of magical nature.

==History==
Sometime before the advent of the [[Weeping War]] and fall of [[Myth Drannor]], [[Shyla]] of [[Damara]] was interred in one of the older and deeper levels of the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] among other heroes of the City of Song. She was laid to rest with her ''shield of purity''. Her grave remained undisturbed as of [[1369 DR]]. If the shield were to be removed from Shyla's sarcophagus, her angry [[wraith]] was sure to seek vengeance.

Another such shield was looted from another grave in the Elven Catacombs in 1369 DR, by a [[wizard]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
