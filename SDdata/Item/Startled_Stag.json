        "mainbody": "The Startled Stag was a strange cursed stag statue created sometime before the late 14 century DR.\nThe Startled Stag was a , two-and-a-half feet tall, bronze statue that depicted a terrified stag. The statue was hollowed on the inside and hid a bottle or a similar receptacle. The bottles neck with the stopper could be accessed between the stags shoulder blades.\nIf anyone were to remove the stopper from between the stags shoulder blades, a clear, odorless gas escaped the bottle. The only evidence of the gas was its sulfurus taste of rotten eggs. The gas affected every breathing creature within ten to forty minutes, freezing them in place. This paralysis lasted for a period of time between one and twenty days.\nThe Startled Stag was one of the more unique items available from the Mistis Moonlight Pawnshop in the Living City, Ravens Bluff, run by Misti Morgan, a proprietor of the establishment and a thief, in the late 14 century DR."
