        "mainbody": "he leaping fish was a magical chalice that was one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, a collection of magical vessels created by the Han people of Koryo in ancient times.\nIt was carved in the shape of a fish with its open mouth serving as the cup.\nWhen a bearer filled the vessel with fine oil and lit it like an oil lamp, it glowed pale blue. They could make one wish that would be granted, as if cast by a great wu jen.\nAs one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, the leaping fishs powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. \nThe shukenja Pitalla used a wish from the leaping fish to cure the settlement of Moki of the ivory plague. He was believed to have then taken it to the island of Suun and left it there.\nIt remained lost by the midâ€“14th century DR."
