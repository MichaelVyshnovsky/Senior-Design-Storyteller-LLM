        "mainbody": "oasted bread or simply toast, was one of the simplest handfoods found in the Realms. It consisted of cooked bread, sometimes seed-bread, often smothered in spreads or soaked in sauces.\nToasted bread was often eaten topped with soft butter, or gravy, Specialized toasting implements were also used in the coastal town of Spandeliyon in Altumbel. These toasting irons were used to affix bread and cheese together to be fire-roasted.\nIt was also known to be served as a side for various dishes, like bowls of simple broth, or plated among morningfeast foods like eggs, ham, bacon, apples, and melons, or topped with sliced fried sausage, or stirge, like they did in Waterdeep and Suzail. The dish called tharval-and-dleem was a spread made with tharval, a type of tiny fish, mashed and smothered over toasted bread. Guests of The Jesters Pride in Julkoun could try another fish variation of toast â€“ topped with river trout with a sauce of lemon, cream, and pepper. Tabras festhall and The Riverman inn in Blackfeather Bridge served buttered toast topped with mushrooms and oysters to its guest and the simple dish was recommended by Volothamp Geddarm as a highlight of the menu.\nToast was also known to be a simple dessert treat when it was served crusted with sugar, notably seen in the Feywild, or covered in butter and cinnamon, as was popular among the guests of The Copper Cup in Waterdeep.\nDuring his visits to Earth, Elminster and the the Wizards Three imbibed squares of toast, something that was presumed to be a type of bread from that world."
