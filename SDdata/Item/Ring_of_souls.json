        "mainbody": "The '''''ring of souls''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[ring]] from the ruins of the City of Song, [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "The ''ring of souls'' was a delicate band of [[silver]] with a tiny locket.",
        "Powers": "The ring allowed the wearer to cast a powerful version of the ''[[halt undead]]'' spell. The ring found in Myth Drannor had four charges left.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the ''ring of souls'' could be found in one of the many deep chambers of the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]], controlled by the forces of [[Cult of the Dragon]] and the [[drow]] of the noble [[House Freth]]. The ring was conveniently left by a powerful undead, defeated via the ring's power sometime before 1369 DR."
