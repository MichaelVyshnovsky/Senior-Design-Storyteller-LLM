An Anstruth harp (|audio=Anstruth.ogg) was a masterwork magical harp and an Instrument of the Bards.
An Anstruth harp was slender and graceful of design, small and light enough to be played in ones lap. It was carved of teak wood engraved with designs of waves and fog, with silver wire for strings.
Anstruth harps were superior in every way to ordinary harps.
Bards wielding an Anstruth harp had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.
Like all Instruments of the Bards, these harps had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing an Anstruth harp could invoke the spells fly, invisibility, levitate, protection from evil and good, control weather, cure wounds, and wall of thorns each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.
The first Anstruth harps were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer. He used them to test and reward the students of the Anstruth level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.
Over time, other bards copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataers honor.
