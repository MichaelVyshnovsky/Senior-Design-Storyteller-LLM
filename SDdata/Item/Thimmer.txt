'''Thimmer''' was a food item found in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}

==Description==
This hearty dish was made from [[boar]] and other animal meats cut into thin strips and fried in a [[pan]] along with diced [[sausage]]. After the meat was cooked and removed from the pan, the drippings were used to make the [[gravy]]. A hardrusk bun was then filled with the pan-fry and topped with gravy. The bun was a [[bowl]]-shaped loaf of bread with a large cavity and a flat bottom, over-baked until the crust was hard. Thimmer could be found at [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]] on the [[North Way]] near Handrornlar, the north gate into Khôltar, the Iron City. It sold for 3 [[silver piece]]s per serving. This dish was Munsrum's version of what many locals fixed at home.
