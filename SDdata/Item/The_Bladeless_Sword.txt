The bladeless sword was an enchanted sword that could only cause harm to creatures immune to mundane weaponry.
The hilt of the weapon was made from silver and encrusted with opals. The blade was made from pure magic and was invisible and intangible as it existed in the Ethereal plane.
The bladeless sword could only cause harm to creatures that were immune to normal weapons, causing twice as much harm to these creatures and three times as much harm to any form of undead.
The bladeless sword was forged by a smith named Holin.
