'''Goggles''' were a kind of headwear that covered the eyes in a practical and protective manner.

==Description==
Goggles resembled [[spectacles]], though with a much tighter fit that enclosed the eyes completely. The lenses were usually cut from [[glass]] and the headband made of a [[leather]] or heavy-duty [[cloth]].

Goggles protected the wearer's eyes from all sorts of hazards, such as flying [[insect]]s, noxious gases, dust, high-speed winds, and many other airborne hazards. The lenses could even be of special concave or convex designs that functioned as spectacles for a short- or long-sighted wearer.

In addition to their other properties, magical goggles were usually made to resize to fit widely ranging head sizes, allowing most people to easily wear them provided they had a [[human]]-like skull shape.

==Notable Goggles==
* ''[[Goggles of astral seeing]]'', which improved vision in the [[Astral Plane]].{{cite web/Astral Encounters/Crosswinds Keep Proper}}
* ''[[Goggles of minute seeing]]'', a [[helmet]] that included magnifying lenses.
* ''[[Goggles of night]]'', which granted the wearer a form of [[darkvision]].
* ''[[Malchor's undersun goggles]]'', which greatly improved low-light vision in the [[Underdark]].
* ''[[Knight Vision Goggles]]'', which made the wearer look like a knight.
* ''[[Shadowsight]]'', a [[Shadovar]] device that saw partway into the [[Shadowfell]].
