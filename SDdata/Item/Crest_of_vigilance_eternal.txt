A '''''crest of vigilance eternal''''' was a symbol worn on the arms&mdash;either as [[bracer]]s or a [[shield]]&mdash;that helped the wearer to focus in combat. This [[magic]] was said to be fueled by the eternal courage of the [[Deva (aasimar)|Devas]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|36}}

==Powers==
While wearing the ''crest of vigilance eternal'', an individual could invoke its power once each day to help them shake off an experience or attack that would otherwise leave them dazed or stunned.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that the true power of the ''crest of vigilance eternal'' could only be tapped by a deva. For instance, if a deva wore the ''crest'' in conjunction with certain other items crafted by their ancestors, the objects were said to grant further powers such as a resistance to [[fire]]. Devas who came into contact with such items often came to feel that they had possessed the same item in a prior life.
