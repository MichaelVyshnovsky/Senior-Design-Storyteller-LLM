The rod of leadership was a magical item that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This item appeared as a stout rod that could actually be used as a potent melee weapon.
Coveted by warriors and priests alike, the rod of leadership inspired all those within 120 yards (110 m) of the wielder with fanatical loyalty and morale.
Those within 30 yards (27 m) of the wielder were completely immune to all forms of magically induced fear.
When wielded as a weapon, the rod of leadership could paralyze targets at the will of the wielder, though using this power drained the rod of all magical properties.
