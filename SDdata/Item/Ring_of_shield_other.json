        "mainbody": "'''''Rings of shield other''''' were enchanted [[ring]]s from [[Waterdeep]], ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "Simply named ''ring of shield other'' allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[shield other]]'' spell on the wearer's allies. The version of the ring in Halbenet's possession was imbued with a more powerful version of the spell that wrapped all of his allies in the protective magis of the item.",
        "History": "''Ring of shield other'' was a gif from [[Laeral Silverhand]] to Halbenet sometime in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She presented the [[moon elf]] with this piece of jewelry saying \"a gift to share with friends\", without revealing the ring's potent magics. Halbenet never failed to brag about the enchanted item, insisting their friends admire Laeral's generous gift.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Halbenet Soladonel]]: a moon elf [[cleric]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15{{th}} century DR."
