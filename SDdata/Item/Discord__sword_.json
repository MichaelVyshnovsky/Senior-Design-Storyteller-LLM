        "mainbody": "'''''Discord''''' was a [[bastard sword]] rumored to have been enchanted with the aid of planar beings.",
        "Description": "This exotic sword had a line of black crystals embedded along the blade.",
        "Powers": "Like other weapons created by [[Ortus]], ''Discord'' started resonating with unnatural frequency upon hitting its target. The sound creating by this was virtually imperceptible by mortal ears, though they suffered its effects regardlessâ€”it dealt sonic damage and had a good chance of causing ''[[confusion]]''. Additionally, this bastard sword possessed a ''+2'' enchantment.",
        "History": "''Discord's'' creator was known as Ortus of [[Gond]], the Mad Tinker. It was a mystery where the uncanny black crystals came from; some believed they were of planar origins, as Ortus was known to have offered his crafting services to beings from beyond the [[Prime Material plane]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], ''Discord'' was in possession of one of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] lackeys who served under [[Kaela Ulsant]] in [[Thentia]], [[Moonsea]]."
