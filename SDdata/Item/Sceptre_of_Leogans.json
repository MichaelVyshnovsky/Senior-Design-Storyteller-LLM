        "mainbody": "The Sceptre of Leogans was a powerful magic wand used by the Cult of the Dragon to capture and brainwash the drow of the House Kilsek in 1369 DR.\nThe Sceptre of Leogans was a decorated bat-winged rod.\nThe Sceptre of Leogans allowed the user to cast the mass suggestion spell and granted them increased charisma and will in exchange for reduced wisdom and fortitude.\nIn 1369 DR, one of the overseers of the Cult of the Dragons was using the Sceptre of Leogans in the deeper levels of the Elven Catacombs to capture and enthrall drow of House Kilsek. The cult used the drow bodies to feed their dragon allies and the dracolich Pelendralaar himself, while the souls were extracted and stored in a large soul vessel in Castle Cormanthors Silverspear Armory."
