The '''''hat of many spells''''' was an unpredictable [[magic item|magical]] hat that allowed the user to attempt to "pull" most [[wizard]] [[spell]]s out of the hat. Failing this, it would produce a random magical effect.

==Powers==
The hat could be used as an arcane focus. This resulted in adding a [[somatic component]] to all spells, where the user reached into the hat and "pulled" the spell out.

A creature attuned to the hat could attempt to cast any wizard they could cast and which had [[material components]] of no more than 1,000 [[gp]]. If successful, the spell was cast normally and the hat could not be used in this way again until the wearer had rested. However, if they failed to control the magic, then an unpredictable magical effect occurred instead.

The ''hat of many spells'' was capable of producing a number of different magical effects, each with a different probability of occurring. They included casting [[spell]]s such as ''[[enlarge]]'' or ''[[reduce]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'' on the user, ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'', ''[[Polymorph (spell)|polymorph]]'', and ''[[stinking cloud]]''. It also had other effects, such as creating a non-magical item; summoning a [[camel]], [[constrictor snake]], [[elephant]], [[mule]], a hostile swarm of [[bat]]s, or a swarm of [[butterfly|butterflies]]; making the user sick with "magic sickness"; [[Petrification|petrifying]] the user; stunning the user; creating a portal to a random [[Cosmology|plane]]; and creating a [[magic item]].

==History==
The only known ''hat of many spells'' to exist was given to the [[wizard]] [[Presto]] by [[the Dungeon Master]] upon arriving in [[the Realm]] ([[Forgotten Realms|no relation]]).{{Cite comic/Saturday Morning Adventures 1}}
