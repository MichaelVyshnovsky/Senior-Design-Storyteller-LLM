Hammer Home was an enchanted warhammer, forged out of cold iron and blessed by a cleric of Lathander.
Hammer Home was specially forged and enchanted in dawns first light to give it powers against creatures from Outer Planes. It possessed a +1 enchantment, but when wielded against extraplanar targets, the weapon effectively became a +2 warhammer that scorched its targets with Lathanders divine magic.
This enchanted warhammers history was largely mysterious. In 1372 DR, Hammer Home was in the hands of the Gillians Hill Gang, a group of bandits who took over the fire cairn tower on Gillians Hills summit and menaced the locals and traveling merchants.
