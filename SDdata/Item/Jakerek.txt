A '''jakerek''' was a type of sled used on the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
The jakerek, the prevailing [[caribou]] sled, was primarily intended for a solitary passenger and one caribou. Resembling the [[Iulutiun]] [[ikaap]] in design, the jakerek featured a {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}-long platform constructed from wood or stacked dried skins. Connecting the platform to the caribou was a lengthy cord. Seated on the platform, the rider extended their legs, while a vertical board covered with fur offered a comfortable backrest.
