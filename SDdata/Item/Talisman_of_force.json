        "mainbody": "talisman of force was a powerful defensive handglyph used by the Geomancers of Kadar to erect a protective shield.\nWhen activated this item created a sphere of force that was  in diameter and centered on the wielder. The protective barrier lasted for 24 minutes before dissipating.\nMost talismans of force had between 2â€”8 charges. They could be recharged, but the process for doing so was known only to a select few wizards in Rogosto.\nThese items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes."
