        "mainbody": "The '''''Bloodbone Throne of Uruth''''' served as the throne for three of the [[orc|orcish]] kings of the realm of [[Uruth Ukrypt]] until it was stolen.",
        "Description": "The throne was made from the fused bones of the orc-king's defeated enemies, particularly the defenders of [[Uthtower]] and [[Phalorm]], and a great [[crag cat]]. The seat itself was made from the ribcage of the crag cat and the back was a triangular stack of skulls, each with a single eye of [[Gruumsh]]. The stairs leading up to the throne were believed to be made from the skulls of six Phalorm princes. Overall the throne had a diameter of over {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} and a height of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Powers": "When someone sat upon the throne, they could call upon its various powers. Among them were the ability to shroud the throne in unholy darkness, [[command]] nearby creatures, spew a cloud of greasy darkness, and cloak themselves in a [[dragon]]-shaped shroud of bones. Perhaps the most powerful ability of the throne, and the one that gave its name, was the ability to summon forth a \"[[blood elemental]]\" of varying degrees in size. The elemental was essentially a [[water elemental]] whose touch could cause one's blood to boil.",
        "History": "Fashioned for the first king of [[Uruth Ukrypt]], the ''Bloodbone Throne'' went on to serve two additional orcish kings in the [[Sword Mountains]]. During the [[Rage of Dragons]], the realm was attacked by the [[black dragon]] [[Shammagar]] and the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]]. Shammagar seized the orcs' capital at [[Melairrin]] as his new lair, and the throne was among the treasures he claimed.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}\n\nWhen a [[rogue]] named [[Asilther Graelor]] plundered Shammagar's hoard over three centuries later, she took possession of the throne for a short time. It was soon lost in transit on its way to [[Herald's Holdfast]] during an ambush near the town of [[Nesm√©]]. Where it went from there is not definitively known. Rumors spread that it may have been in the western reaches of the [[High Forest]], where it was being used by an antlered orc king.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Uruth]], the first king of Uruth Ukrypt\n* [[Shammagar]], a [[black dragon]]\n* [[Asilther Graelor]], a [[half-elf|half-elven]] [[rogue]]"
