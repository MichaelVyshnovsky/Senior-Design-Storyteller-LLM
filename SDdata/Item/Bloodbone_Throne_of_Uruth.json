        "mainbody": "The Bloodbone Throne of Uruth served as the throne for three of the orcish kings of the realm of Uruth Ukrypt until it was stolen.\nThe throne was made from the fused bones of the orc-kings defeated enemies, particularly the defenders of Uthtower and Phalorm, and a great crag cat. The seat itself was made from the ribcage of the crag cat and the back was a triangular stack of skulls, each with a single eye of Gruumsh. The stairs leading up to the throne were believed to be made from the skulls of six Phalorm princes. Overall the throne had a diameter of over  and a height of .\nWhen someone sat upon the throne, they could call upon its various powers. Among them were the ability to shroud the throne in unholy darkness, command nearby creatures, spew a cloud of greasy darkness, and cloak themselves in a dragon-shaped shroud of bones. Perhaps the most powerful ability of the throne, and the one that gave its name, was the ability to summon forth a \"blood elemental\" of varying degrees in size. The elemental was essentially a water elemental whose touch could cause ones blood to boil.\nFashioned for the first king of Uruth Ukrypt, the Bloodbone Throne went on to serve two additional orcish kings in the Sword Mountains. During the Rage of Dragons, the realm was attacked by the black dragon Shammagar and the green dragon Claugiyliamatar. Shammagar seized the orcs capital at Melairrin as his new lair, and the throne was among the treasures he claimed.\nWhen a rogue named Asilther Graelor plundered Shammagars hoard over three centuries later, she took possession of the throne for a short time. It was soon lost in transit on its way to Heralds Holdfast during an ambush near the town of Nesm√©. Where it went from there is not definitively known. Rumors spread that it may have been in the western reaches of the High Forest, where it was being used by an antlered orc king.\n* Uruth, the first king of Uruth Ukrypt\n* Shammagar, a black dragon\n* Asilther Graelor, a half-elven rogue"
