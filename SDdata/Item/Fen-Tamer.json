        "Powers": "''Fen-Tamer'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and an impressive ''+3'' enchantment when wielded against vermin. Additionally, this [[mighty]] weapon allowed the wielder to use their strength to increase the bow's damage.",
        "History": "''Fen-Tamer'' was crafted sometime before {{Yearlink|1374}} to aid the lizardfolk against dangerous vermin of the Mere of Dead Men and help capture other species of swamp critters to be tamed. However, the bow was just as effective against non-vermin opponents. ''Circa'' 1374 DR, ''Fen-Tamer'' was wielded by the lizardfolk who served [[black dragon]]s [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]]."
