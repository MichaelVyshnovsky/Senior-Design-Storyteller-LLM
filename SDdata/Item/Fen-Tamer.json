        "mainbody": "Fen-Tamer was an enchanted shortbow created by the lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men.\nFen-Tamer possessed a +1 enchantment and an impressive +3 enchantment when wielded against vermin. Additionally, this mighty weapon allowed the wielder to use their strength to increase the bows damage.\nFen-Tamer was crafted sometime before  to aid the lizardfolk against dangerous vermin of the Mere of Dead Men and help capture other species of swamp critters to be tamed. However, the bow was just as effective against non-vermin opponents. Circa 1374 DR, Fen-Tamer was wielded by the lizardfolk who served black dragons Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor."
