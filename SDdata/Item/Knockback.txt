Knockback was a quality that could be applied to weapons. It increased the chance to knock back an opponent or stunned when struck with the weapon. A weapon, if having this quality, could completely knock an opponent over, leaving them vulnerable to further attacks.
The spell repulsion was used in the creation of knockback weapons.
