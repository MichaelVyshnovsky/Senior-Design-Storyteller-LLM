The gauntlets of infernal damnation were a type of cursed set of gloves.
These gloves were made of a hard, black leather.
Being a cursed item, these gloves became affixed to whoever put them on and they could only be removed by the spell remove curse. In addition, upon donning these gloves the spell shroud of flame would be cast upon the wearer.
Some time prior to the late-13 century DR, a sinister priestess of Beshaba invented this type of cursed item. Wealthy adventurers would occasionally buy these to place in their treasure hordes as traps for potential thieves.
In 1281 DR, a pair of gauntlets of infernal damnation were found within the Wyrms Tooth Glacier in the possession of a tribe of frost giants led by Joril Frostbeard.
