        "mainbody": "Githyanki silver swords were weapons given to the knights and leaders of the githyanki race. They were powerful magical greatswords that came in two varieties, depending on the wielders rank. Their most notable property was the ability to sever an individuals silver cord.\nAllegedly based on the Silver Sword of Gith, every githyanki knight (warrior champions in service to the Lich Queen), was given one of these weapons once they achieved a sufficient level of power to will the blades into existence. Leaders of githyanki communities carried even more powerful versions of the weapon that could cut the silver cords of those who had protected themselves from such attacks and were enchanted to increase the likelihood of decapitating an opponent.\nSilver swords were originally designed to aid the githyanki in the fight for freedom from the mind flayers. For that reason, they were capable of dealing damage to ones mind as well as physical damage.\nNo owner of a silver sword would ever willingly allow a non-githyanki to hold their weapon. If any silver sword found its way into the hands of a non-githyanki, elite squadrons of githyanki were sent by a furious Lich Queen to take it back at any cost. If the squad sent failed to retrieve it, they would be executed.\nIt was believed by some sages that manufacturing a silver sword required a fragment of the Living Gate. The githyanki regularly searched for new fragments in secret expeditions across the Astral Plane. It was also believed that including the fragment in the construction of a silver sword provided it with the ability to resonate with its wielder in the case of an invasion from the Far Realm, which would explain the githyankis efficiency in responding to any incursions."
