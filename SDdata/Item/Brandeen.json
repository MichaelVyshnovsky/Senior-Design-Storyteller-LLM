        "mainbody": "'''Brandeen''' was the common name in the Realms for a rare, [[Fancy stones|fancy stone]] also known as the mineral [[wikipedia:en:Stibiotantalite|stibiotantalite]].{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|19}} They were typically worn by merchants and mid-level courtiers as a substitute for more expensive gemstones.",
        "Description": "Brandeen was found in deposits that were usually honey-yellow to reddish-brown in hue, but often cloudy or opaque. The fancy stones were cut from areas where the raw mineral turned transparent, yielding small, hard, faceted gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.",
        "Powers": "Powdered brandeen was a key ingredient in making a potion that cured deafness. The powdered mineral was mixed with fresh hardwood sap and then a ''[[message]]'' spell was cast upon it, the message being made up of only vowel sounds. The potion had to be consumed within twenty-four hours or it spoiled. Likewise, it spoiled if exposed to sunlight."
