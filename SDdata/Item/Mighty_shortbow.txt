Mighty shortbows were a type of enchanted or mundane ranged weapons that dealt increased damage to their targets.
Mighty shortbows were hand-carved out of affixed together tight layers of wood. They were significantly more lightweight than similar weapons yet had increased sturdiness.
These bows were constructed and sometimes enchanted so the shooter could draw the bowstring further back, allowing them to use physical strength in order to dramatically increase the force with which mighty shortbows released arrows.
