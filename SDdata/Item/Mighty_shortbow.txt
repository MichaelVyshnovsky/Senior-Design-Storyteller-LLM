'''''Mighty shortbows''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] or mundane ranged weapons that dealt increased damage to their targets.

==Description==
''Mighty shortbows'' were hand-carved out of affixed together tight layers of wood. They were significantly more lightweight than similar weapons yet had increased sturdiness.

==Powers==
These [[bow]]s were constructed and sometimes enchanted so the shooter could draw the [[bowstring]] further back, allowing them to use physical strength in order to dramatically increase the force with which ''mighty shortbows'' released [[arrow]]s.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Ramu]], a [[hunting spider katanga]], who served the dreaded [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] ''circa'' the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
