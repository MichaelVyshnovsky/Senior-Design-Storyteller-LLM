The Ring of Disbelief was an enchanted ring from Castle Cormanthor of Myth Drannor.
This piece of simple jewelry was a carved wooden band.
The Ring of Disbelief allowed the wearer to cast a potent version of the dispel magic spell. The item had ten charges.
In 1369 DR, during the Cult of the Dragons occupation of Myth Drannor, they took over Castle Cormanthor, making the once-grand stronghold the Cults base. The Ring of Disbelief was looted from the Hall of Armanthors of the castle by the Cult of the Dragon wizard overseers.
