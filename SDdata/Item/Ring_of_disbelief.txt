The '''''Ring of Disbelief''''' was an enchanted [[ring]] from [[Castle Cormanthor]] of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
This piece of simple [[jewelry]] was a carved wooden band.

==Powers==
The ''Ring of Disbelief'' allowed the wearer to cast a potent version of the ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell. The item had ten charges.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], during the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s occupation of Myth Drannor, they took over Castle Cormanthor, making the once-grand stronghold the Cult's base. The ''Ring of Disbelief'' was looted from the Hall of Armanthors of the castle by the Cult of the Dragon [[wizard]] overseers.
