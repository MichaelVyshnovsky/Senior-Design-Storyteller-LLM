Beads of refreshment were magical pellets that converted a variety of liquids into fresh water.
The bead was spongy and gelatinous in texture and did not have any flavor.
When mixed into any non-magical, non-harmful liquid, a bead of refreshment dissolved and converted up to 1 pint (470 milliliters) of the liquid into cold drinkable water.
