Master Lis Way was the name given to a number of magical katanas from Kara-Tur that appeared in Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR.
The katanas bore the makers mark of Master Hu Li.
A Master Lis Way was a +2 keen katana that inflicted corrosive acid injuries.
These katanas were originally fashioned by the great Kara-Turan artificer Master Hu Li, who was little known in Faerûn.
By 1372 DR, a number of these katanas began to turn up in the stores of weapons-dealers in northwest Faerûn. The first was considered to be a unique example of sword-making, but more swords appeared, all connected to a ship that had run aground on the Sword Coast of Faerûn some years before.
