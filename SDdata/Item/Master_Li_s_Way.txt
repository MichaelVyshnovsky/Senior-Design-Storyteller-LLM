'''''Master Li's Way''''' was the name given to a number of magical [[katana]]s from [[Kara-Tur]] that appeared in [[Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The katanas bore the maker's mark of Master Hu Li.

==Powers==
A ''Master Li's Way'' was a ''+2 [[keen]] katana'' that inflicted corrosive [[acid]] injuries.

==History==
These katanas were originally fashioned by the great Kara-Turan artificer Master [[Hu Li]], who was little known in Faerûn.

By [[1372 DR]], a number of these katanas began to turn up in the stores of weapons-dealers in [[northwest Faerûn]]. The first was considered to be a unique example of sword-making, but more swords appeared, all connected to a ship that had run aground on the [[Sword Coast]] of Faerûn some years before.
