        "mainbody": "A dweomered door was a term used to describe one of many types of magical doorways.\nThese doors often came in odd shapes and sizes, and were masterfully crafted from exotic woods and materials. Other times a dweomered door was simple and plain in appearance, perhaps to disguise the treasures that were found behind.\nDweomered doors were often used as a deterrent against potential thieves from reaching treasure caches or other valuables. On the other hand, they could simply be placed as a punishment for overly curious explorers. For example, the animating door would animate any corpse that was brought through its threshold, while the door of beasts, when opened, would burst open and release several monsters.\nThese unique passageways often, especially in the former instance, had additional locks and traps, both mechanical and magical attached to them.\nThese magical doors were widely used in the Shining South, especially Halruaa where they were often installed in wizard sanctums.\n* Animating door\n* Holding door\n* Door of beasts\n* Door of derangement\n* Door of mirrors\n* Door of negation\n* Door of visions\n* Silencing door"
