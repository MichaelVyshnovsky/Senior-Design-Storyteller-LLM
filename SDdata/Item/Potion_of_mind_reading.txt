A potion of mind reading was a potion that temporarily empowered its drinker with the power to read minds.
A typical potion of mind reading was a dense, purple liquid. Floating within the liquid, an ovoid pink cloud could be seen.
The potion gave its drinker the effects of the detect thoughts spell.
One of the recipes of potions of mind reading required a potion of an alchemical suspension of mergrass mixed with certain alchemical sublimates.
