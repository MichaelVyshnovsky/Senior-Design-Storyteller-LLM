'''''Gladiator's clubs''''' were magic blunt weapons often crafted using [[ironwood]].

==Powers==
There were various ''gladiator's clubs'' of somewhat similar form and power. Most were just powerful magic weapons that dealt bludgeoning damage, but some rarer ''gladiator's clubs'' could leave the opponent dazed after a successful hit.

==History==
Possibly the original ''gladiator's club'' belonged to a champion gladiator of [[Chessenta]], [[Jorag Muthkik]]. He was a slave, like other warriors in the gladiator pits, and belonged to a [[wizard]]. Jorag's master always outfitted him with the best equipment to make sure the gladiator always won. The ''gladiator's club'' was a gift the master gave to Jorag after a win that earned the wizard a fortune. Jorag Muthkik survived into his old age and after retiring from the pits he made a living at one of the top gladiator schools in Chessenta, using his ''gladiator's club'' to punish his students instead of opponents.

One of these magic clubs was created during the [[Wailing Death]] epidemic of [[1372 DR]] in [[Neverwinter]]. Master blacksmith [[Marrok]] of [[Shining Knight Arms and Armor]] created it using ironwood for the [[Hero of Neverwinter]].

Another ''gladiator's club'' was created in [[1372 DR]] by [[dwarf]] blacksmith [[Barun]] in the [[Uthgardt]] village [[Beorunna's Well]]. The club bore his mark and was later used against Lady [[Aribeth]] the Betrayer's forces when she led them against the [[Lords' Alliance]].

During [[Gorgomorz]] and the [[Zhentarim]]'s plot against [[Daggerford]] that year, one of the ''gladiator's clubs'' bearing the mark of Marrok found its way into the hands of a [[goblin]] chieftain allied with Gorgomorz's [[Tanarukk|tanarukka]] forces.
