Gladiators clubs were magic blunt weapons often crafted using ironwood.
There were various gladiators clubs of somewhat similar form and power. Most were just powerful magic weapons that dealt bludgeoning damage, but some rarer gladiators clubs could leave the opponent dazed after a successful hit.
Possibly the original gladiators club belonged to a champion gladiator of Chessenta, Jorag Muthkik. He was a slave, like other warriors in the gladiator pits, and belonged to a wizard. Jorags master always outfitted him with the best equipment to make sure the gladiator always won. The gladiators club was a gift the master gave to Jorag after a win that earned the wizard a fortune. Jorag Muthkik survived into his old age and after retiring from the pits he made a living at one of the top gladiator schools in Chessenta, using his gladiators club to punish his students instead of opponents.
One of these magic clubs was created during the Wailing Death epidemic of 1372 DR in Neverwinter. Master blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor created it using ironwood for the Hero of Neverwinter.
Another gladiators club was created in 1372 DR by dwarf blacksmith Barun in the Uthgardt village Beorunnas Well. The club bore his mark and was later used against Lady Aribeth the Betrayers forces when she led them against the Lords Alliance.
During Gorgomorz and the Zhentarims plot against Daggerford that year, one of the gladiators clubs bearing the mark of Marrok found its way into the hands of a goblin chieftain allied with Gorgomorzs tanarukka forces.
