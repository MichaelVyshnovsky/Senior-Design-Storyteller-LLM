        "mainbody": "The so-called skullcap treat was a customary gift and a food item from the land of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach.\nIn Turmish, a custom dictated that a guest brought a gift upon visits. These guest-dishes were provided for the hosts welcoming table. Most common guest-dishes included homemade wines, flavored breads, cheeses, and meats. The value of a gift reflected the stature of the guest. The skullcap treat was aptly named for its receptacleâ€”an overturned skull of a human. The skull was filled with snails, an edible treat. The dishs reputation was quite widespread and skullcap treats were mentioned in several old ballads. \nThe origins of skullcap treats could be traced by scholars all the way back to conflicts between humans and lizardfolk of the Halondar swamps. When the humans and lizardmen met to sign a peace-pact and feast in celebration, the scaly guests presented humans with the first skullcap treat. Reportedly, their human hosts were quite horrified at the time."
