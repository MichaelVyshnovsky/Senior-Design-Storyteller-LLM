        "mainbody": "A '''''tabard of the mystics''''' was a type of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[tabard]]. Its construction process was difficult, expensive, and known to only few.",
        "Description": "These tabards consisted of green cloth with gold trim and a stiff, stand-up flared collar. Powdered [[gold]] and [[serpentine]] were worked into the very fibers of the tabard.",
        "Powers": "Those who wore one of these tabards became impossible to burn and nearly impervious to harm from [[fire]]. They also became immune to the effects of ''[[scarab of insanity]]'' and had greater probability at resisting ''[[magic jar]]''.\n\n''[[Symbol]]'' could be cast upon the tabard, rendering it invisible until it was touched and a [[command word]] was spoken or the garment was removed without a command word spoken.\n\n[[Magic-user]]s that wore these cloaks were uniquely capable of opening doors or [[portal]]s that had been ''[[wizard lock]]ed'' or ''[[hold person|held]]'' as though they were a more experienced spellcaster."
