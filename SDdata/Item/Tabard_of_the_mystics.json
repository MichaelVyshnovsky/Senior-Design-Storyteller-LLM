        "mainbody": "A tabard of the mystics was a type of enchanted tabard. Its construction process was difficult, expensive, and known to only few.\nThese tabards consisted of green cloth with gold trim and a stiff, stand-up flared collar. Powdered gold and serpentine were worked into the very fibers of the tabard.\nThose who wore one of these tabards became impossible to burn and nearly impervious to harm from fire. They also became immune to the effects of scarab of insanity and had greater probability at resisting magic jar.\nSymbol could be cast upon the tabard, rendering it invisible until it was touched and a command word was spoken or the garment was removed without a command word spoken.\nMagic-users that wore these cloaks were uniquely capable of opening doors or portals that had been wizard locked or held as though they were a more experienced spellcaster."
