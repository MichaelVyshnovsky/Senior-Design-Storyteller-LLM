He used the weapon to kill indiscriminately at the behest of his adventuring troupe – the Winnowing Drake Company. Donalds halfling friend, Tim Rootfield, once said that the axe was sharp enough to leave half the Faerûn widowed. Black Donald responded by saying that it was sharp enough to cut through the husbands and return to the village to get the wives on the follow-through. This comment gave the ace its name – Widow-Through.\nBy 1312 DR, Widow-Through belonged to Tahvo the Huntmaster from the Wandering Village of Icewind Dale. The Huntmaster offered his stock of supplies, armor, and weapons for trade with travelers and merchants who traveled between the Ten-Towns and Kuldahar."
