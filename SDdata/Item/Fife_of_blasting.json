        "mainbody": "Fifes of blasting were wind instruments enchanted with offensive sonic magics.\nFifes of blasting appeared as small mundane flutes.\nWhen blown into, these fifes produced a damaging burst of ultrasonic sound. This effect was similar to the effects of the sound burst spell.\nAs of the late 14 century DR, these instruments were available from vendors who dealt in magic goods. Some could be found in the markets of Neverwinter. One of the vendors who owned a fife of blasting was Tarmas of the Mere of Dead Men."
