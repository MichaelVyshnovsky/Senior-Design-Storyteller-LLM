'''''Nimoar's blazing bulwark''''' was a magical [[shield]] employed by the famed [[Nimoar|Nimoar the Reaver]], War Lord of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The ''bulwark'' was a heavy [[steel]] [[shield]] fitted with [[shield spikes|spikes]]. The shield weighed about {{SI|20|lb|k|long=yes}} and would sell for around 12,480 [[gold pieces]] in most markets of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Powers==
The shield itself was enchanted to act as a ''[[bashing]]'' shield, while the attached spikes were enchanted to act as a ''[[flaming]]'' weapon.

==History==
This weaponized shield was carried into battle by Nimoar the Reaver during the [[First Trollwar]] of the {{YearlinkName|932}}, where it served well against the [[Regeneration|regenerating]] [[Troll|giant]]s.

After Nimoar's death, the ''blazing bulwark'' came to the Waterdhavian family of [[Silmerhelve]],{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}} where it was passed down for generations. When heir [[Laerlos Silmerhelve II]] left Waterdeep and his family to join the [[Midnight Men]] mercenary group, he took the shiled with him. Laerlos fell in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]] in the {{YearlinkName|1343}}, and the shield was buried alongside his body in the [[Cairn of Moonlight]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Nimoar]]
* [[Laerlos Silmerhelve II]]
