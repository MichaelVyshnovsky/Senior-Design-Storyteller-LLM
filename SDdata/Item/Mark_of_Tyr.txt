Marks of Tyr were amulets of the Tyrran faith in the late 15 century DR.
Marks of Tyr were round golden disks decorated with Tyrs holy symbol. The gold discs hung off a thong that consisted of multiple segments, tied together.
A mark of Tyr possessed an enchantment that allowed its owner to compel their opponent to disarm themselves for a short period of time, deterring them from attacking or taking any offensive actions.
