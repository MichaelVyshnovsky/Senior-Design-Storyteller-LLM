Sharptongue was a +3 magical rapier that was the favored weapon of the deity, Milil. He would, at times, loan the blade to those who completed great tasks and quests in his honor.
When wielded by Milil, Sharptongue had the powers of both a sword of quickness and a sword of dancing. In the hands of others, it had the abilities of one, or the other, though never at the same time.
