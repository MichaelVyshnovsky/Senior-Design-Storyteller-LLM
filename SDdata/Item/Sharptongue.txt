'''''Sharptongue''''' was a ''+3 magical [[rapier]]'' that was the favored weapon of the [[deity]], [[Milil]]. He would, at times, loan the blade to those who completed great tasks and quests in his honor.

==Abilities==
When wielded by Milil, ''Sharptongue'' had the powers of both a ''[[sword of quickness]]'' and a ''[[sword of dancing]]''. In the hands of others, it had the abilities of one, or the other, though never at the same time.
