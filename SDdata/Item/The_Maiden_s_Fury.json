        "mainbody": "'''''The Maiden's Fury''''' was a minor artifact [[whip]] that belonged to the [[Church of Loviatar]].",
        "Powers": "''The Maiden's Fury'' possessed several cruel and deadly enchantments to overcome its weak damage output. The whip was imbued with a potent ''+4'' enchantment. Additionally, ''the Maiden's Fury'' tapped into [[Loviatar]]'s divine magic that ''[[haste]]d'' the wielder, and allowed them to leave open bleeding wounds on their targets with each successful slash. Being a whip, it also allowed the wielder to disarm their targets easily with whipping.",
        "History": "This weapon was a minor artifact that channeled the sadistic and deprived powers of its deity. A well-known tale of ''the Maiden's Fury'' told of a powerful devotee of Loviatar who wielded the weapon against a room full of willing whipping targets. It only took the Loviatan priest mere seconds to reduce the entire room to a crying lacerated blood-soaked mess. The willing victims rushed out of the room, falling and slipping in their own bodily fluids, and promptly denounced the worshiping of the Maiden of Pain and joint the church of [[Ilmater]].\n\nBy [[1373 DR]], ''the Maiden's Fury'' could be found in the [[Moonsea]] region."
