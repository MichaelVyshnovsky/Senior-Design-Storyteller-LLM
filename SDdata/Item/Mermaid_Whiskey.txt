Mermaid Whiskey was a whiskey exported from Tethyr.
This whiskey was described as having a very elegant and refined flavor, with its expressiveness being compared to a bards song. It was commonly sold in a wonderfully crafted blue bottle bearing a depiction of a mermaid.
It was sought after by the wealthy in Baldurs Gate and could be frequently found within their mansions. It was also stocked by taverns in the city, notably the Elfsong Tavern.
