'''''Horseshoes of speed''''' were [[enchanted]] [[horseshoe]]s that when affixed to a [[horse]],

==Description==
These shoes were typically made of [[iron]], always came in sets of four, and looked relatively mundane. These horseshoes weighed about {{SI|3|lb|long=yes}} each.

==Powers==
These horseshoes gave off a faint [[aura]] of [[transmutation]] magic. When affixed to the hooves of any horse, ''horseshoes of speed'' would double the rate at which they typically moved, as well as proportionally increased the distance at which they could jumping. All four of the horseshoes within a set had to be worn in order for this effect to be active, though older versions of ''horseshoes of speed'' would simply drop the rate of movement down by a margin of 25% if only three were worn. On average, there was a 1% chance with these older versions of a horseshoe falling off every {{SIrange|20|21|mile|long=yes}}.

In addition to their speed enchanting effect, ''horseshoes of speed'' would notably never wear out.

==Availability==
These horseshoes were a particularly common form of magical item in the land of [[Tethyr]].<ref>

==Crafting==
Creating a set of ''horseshoes of speed'' required a [[spellcaster]] with the [[spell]] ''[[haste]]''.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], a group of [[priest]]s of [[Tiamat]] living within the [[Altar of Scales]] (a secret temple in the undercity of [[Unthalass]]) kept one a set of ''horseshoes of speed'' in their treasury.
