The '''Wyrmskull Throne''' was a throne made from the skulls of four [[blue dragons]] slain by [[Taark Shanat]] around {{Yearlink|-12000}} to bring the [[Cloaker Wars]] to a victorious end for his [[dwarf|dwarves]]. It was believed that the throne was forged by [[Dumathoin]]'s hand.

==History==
The throne originally resided in [[Brightaxe Hall]] (originally the [[Rift of Dhalnadar]]), in the lair of the blue dragons. When Brightaxe Hall was abandoned during the [[Third Spider War]] around {{Yearlink|-6150}}, the dwarves took the throne with them.

In [[1360 DR]], a gang of pirates briefly recovered the Wyrmskull Throne in the [[Bay of Skulls]] near [[Hook Isle]], but then lost it again<ref name=GHotR-p145">

The Throne resurfaced around [[1370 DR]] in possession of the [[aquatic elf]] tyrant [[Gantar Kraok]]

After an adventuring party took it away from the Gantar KraokÂ they sold it to [[storm giant]] queen [[Neri]] for a considerable fortune. She magically enlarged it and gave it as gift to her husband king [[Hekaton]].
