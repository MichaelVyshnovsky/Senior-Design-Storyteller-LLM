        "Description": "This heavy whitish cheese was streaked with black or blue veins,{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-02-24 - Elturian Grey and Green Calishite}}  giving it the appearance of stone, hence its other names. Despite its appearance and unappetizing nicknames, this pungent cheese was a tasty treat. Elturian Grey was fermented using a certain species of [[mold]] that grew on grass and [[clover]]. The fermentation process took months but it left the cheese stable and able to be kept in open air without spoilage for almost a year. Matured cheese had a pungent aroma reminiscent of [[vinegar]] and taste of hot-sauce-fried [[ham]] and [[pineapple]].\n\nThe name dwarfcheese was given to it due to almost all [[dwarves]]'s love for Elturian Grey. Many stout folk hoarded this cheese and endlessly praise it taste on words and writing.",
        "History": "The premier cheese of Elturel in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Aurora]] not only solid it via [[Aurora's Emporium]] but kept some in her own larder. She enjoyed surprising it on guests who complained about Elturel and other trade cities, and its reputation spread.\n\nBy the early 1360s DR, these other trade cities were producing imitations, often made from cow's milk and with close names like \"Elturel Grey\" or \"Elturel Gray\". ''Circa'' [[1366 DR]], \"Elturian gray\" was being sold in neighboring [[Scornubel]], where it was quite popular among the cheese selection at the [[Far Anchor]] inn, but [[Volothamp Geddarm]] remarked he didn't see much of it when in Elturel.<ref> By [[1370 DR]], \"Elturian Gray\" was available at [[The Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]] inn in [[Highmoon]], [[Deepingdale]], among its wide selection of strong cheeses.<ref><ref group=\"note\">Given the variations in phrasing, spelling, and case of these cheeses in the sources, it is difficult to know which are genuine and which are counterfeit.",
        "Prices": "The original Elturian Grey could be purchased from Aurora's in the following sizes:\n* Loaf, 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) for 6 [[sp]]"
