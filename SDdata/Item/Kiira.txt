A '''''kiira''''', which was the [[Elven language|Elven]] word for '''lore gem''', was a wearable magic gem that enhanced one's memory.

==Description==
A ''kiira'' was a smooth, hemispherical [[precious stones|precious stone]]. It was worn on the forehead, magically attaching harmlessly to the wearer's skin.

==Powers==
When someone was wearing a ''kiira'', she or he would find a greater ability to focus and an improved informational memory. One only had to concentrate for a few seconds to acquire this benefit. In addition, a spellcaster wearing a ''kiira'' could use it to store and prepare spells, just as if using a [[spellbook]]. A typical ''kiira'' could store up to 30 spells, no matter how simple or complicated they were.

If someone was wearing a ''kiira'', another magical item worn on the head would not function at the same time.

==Construction==
A mage who could cast the spells ''[[legend lore]]'' and ''[[secret page]]'' and who was trained in the crafting of magical items could turn a gem into a ''kiira''.

==Cost==
An "empty" ''kiira'' sold for about 7,500 [[gold piece]]s; one that had spells stored in it would cost much more, depending on the number of stored spells.

==History==
More powerful versions of ''kiira'', known as ''greater kiira'' or ''[[tel'kiira]]'' existed from the time of [[Myth Drannor]], which were both more powerful and more dangerous, but most ''kiira'' found in the world by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] were of the variety described here.
