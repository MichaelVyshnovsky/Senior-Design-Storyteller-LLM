        "mainbody": "n amulet of pure good was an enchanted amulet used to punish wicked priests.\nA good-hearted priest could use this amulet to harm evil priests by causing a flaming crack to open in the ground beneath their feet, swallowing the evil-doer forever and sending them plummeting toward the center of Toril. A priest wielding an amulet of pure good who was not completely pure of conscience allowed the evil-doer a small chance to resist the attack. Additionally, physical harm would strike any gray or dark priest attempting to hold the amulet. These items did not work if used against anyone but an evil priest.\nThese amulets had seven charges and could not be recharged.\nCorellons avatar wore an amulet of pure good."
