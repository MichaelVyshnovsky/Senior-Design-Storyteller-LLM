'''Fowl stew''' was a poultry dish from the [[Singing Sprite]] inn of [[Secomber]].

==Description==
The [[stew]] was one of the Sprite's plainest dishes, but was still an exceptional meal. Like other stews, the Sprite often made it with ingredients that were damaged or wilted and couldn't be used in other dishes. Damaged fowl frames and leftover meat could be used, but the cooks also used fresh whole birds. The game bird or poultry could be plucked or simply [[spit]]ted intact over a fire, with the [[feather]]s catching alight and burning away. The charred skin could be easily removed then, and the bird roasted through. With the meat browned, the bird was quartered and simmered in a [[pot]] half-full of [[wine]], where it was joined by minced [[onion]]s and old [[fruit]]. The stew was further flavored with crushed dried [[sage (plant)|sage]], [[thyme]], a pinch of either [[cinnamon]] or ground [[clove]]s, and potentially fresh crushed [[garlic]]. [[Potato]]es and leftover [[broth]] could also be added to fill out the stew, and [[parsley]], [[pepper]], [[salt]], or garlic were also often used as extra seasoning.

==Availability==
The stew was served at the Singing Sprite inn, alongside [[Three Crabs]], [[A Trio of Trumpets]], and the [[Hungry Knight]].
