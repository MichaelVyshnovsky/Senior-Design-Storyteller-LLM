Fowl stew was a poultry dish from the Singing Sprite inn of Secomber.
The stew was one of the Sprites plainest dishes, but was still an exceptional meal. Like other stews, the Sprite often made it with ingredients that were damaged or wilted and couldnt be used in other dishes. Damaged fowl frames and leftover meat could be used, but the cooks also used fresh whole birds. The game bird or poultry could be plucked or simply spitted intact over a fire, with the feathers catching alight and burning away. The charred skin could be easily removed then, and the bird roasted through. With the meat browned, the bird was quartered and simmered in a pot half-full of wine, where it was joined by minced onions and old fruit. The stew was further flavored with crushed dried sage, thyme, a pinch of either cinnamon or ground cloves, and potentially fresh crushed garlic. Potatoes and leftover broth could also be added to fill out the stew, and parsley, pepper, salt, or garlic were also often used as extra seasoning.
The stew was served at the Singing Sprite inn, alongside Three Crabs, A Trio of Trumpets, and the Hungry Knight.
