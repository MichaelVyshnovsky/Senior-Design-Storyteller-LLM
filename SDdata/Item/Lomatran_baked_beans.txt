'''Lomatran baked beans''' was a morningfeast and dinner dish unique to the [[Blade Kingdoms]] and the city-state of [[Lomatra]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lomatran [[bean]]s were cooked mixed with local [[sausage]]s inside decorated and covered [[ceramic]] [[pot]]s. Once the dish was baked thoroughly, it was served in the same individual pot they were cooked in. To eat, one just needed to remove the lid.

Cooks baked numerous pots simultaneously and transported them to the establishments and individuals who ordered the meals. One such bean bakery shop stood on the [[High Street]] in Lomatra.
