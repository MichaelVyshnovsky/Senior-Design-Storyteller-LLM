        "mainbody": "The '''Idol of Silvanus''' was a sacred wooden carving of [[Silvanus]], the Oak Father, the god of nature known for his impartial fairness. It was located within the [[Emerald Grove]], a sanctuary of the [[Emerald Enclave]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Powers": "The idol was the focus for a powerful ritual called the [[Rite of Thorns]], which would protect and seal away the grove from possible intruders. The statue also radiated a magical glow that made those basked in it understand the natural word a bit better.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[tiefling]] child [[Arabella]] stole the idol from atop its pedestal in the Emerald Grove."
