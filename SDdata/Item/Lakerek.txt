A '''lakerek''' was a type of sled used on the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
The lakerek, known as the swiftest [[caribou]] sled, beared a resemblance to a [[kayak]] equipped with reins. Its design featured a dried skin stretched over a sturdy wooden frame. To embark on this sled, a single passenger positioned themselves within the opening atop the sled. Balancing themselves, they grasped a long pole called a pilakerek, ensuring stability throughout the ride.
