Bloodstone double axe was an enchanted double axe from Tethyr.
This double-ended axe was enchantmented and granted its wielder regeneration.
Bloodstone double axe belonged to the Bloodstone mercenary group circa 1090 DR. The history remembered this particular company for their attempted participation in the Battle of the Bones of 1090 DR. The mercenaries outfitted themselves, sparing no expanse for the battle. However, the ship that transported the Bloodstones from Tethyr was swarmed and sank. This dread double axe remained on the very few reminders of their existence.
In 1373 DR, the Bloodstone double axe was in the hands of the leader of the Bloodaxe. After his death, however, the axes whereabouts remained unclear.
*Jarl Bashnagg the leader of the nomadic frost giant Bloodaxe tribe that dwelt in a cave between Voonlar and YÃ»lash circa 1373 DR.
