        "Description": "''Rings of lesser and greater resistance'' were bands of precious metal that varied in design but had similar enchantments placed on them.",
        "Powers": "''Rings of lesser resistance'' possessed enchantments that protected the wearer from spells and similar magics, while their stronger versions, ''rings of greater resistance'' provided greater resistance to spells, a ''+2'' enchantment to physical defenses, and granted resistance to crushing damage.",
        "History": "By [[1281 DR]], these rings could be found in the vicinity of [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]. [[Malavon Despana]], a powerful [[drow]] [[wizard]], kept one such ring in his throne room inside [[Dorn's Deep]]. And lesser variations could be purchased from [[Tiernon]], a blind [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith of the [[Clan Hearthstone]] in the Gloomfrost Caverns."
