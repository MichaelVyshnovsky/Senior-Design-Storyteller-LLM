        "mainbody": "Rings of lesser resistance and rings of greater resistance were enchanted rings that protected their wearers from spells.\nRings of lesser and greater resistance were bands of precious metal that varied in design but had similar enchantments placed on them.\nRings of lesser resistance possessed enchantments that protected the wearer from spells and similar magics, while their stronger versions, rings of greater resistance provided greater resistance to spells, a +2 enchantment to physical defenses, and granted resistance to crushing damage.\nBy 1281 DR, these rings could be found in the vicinity of Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. Malavon Despana, a powerful drow wizard, kept one such ring in his throne room inside Dorns Deep. And lesser variations could be purchased from Tiernon, a blind dwarven smith of the Clan Hearthstone in the Gloomfrost Caverns."
