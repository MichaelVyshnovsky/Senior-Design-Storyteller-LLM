Symylazarr (the Fount of Honor) was an ancient rune-engraved blade with a pommel in the shape of a dragons head.
The sword was used ceremonially around 376 DR by leaders of noble houses to swear allegiance to the king of Cormyr. 
The High Wizard Vangerdahast was able to summon and dismiss the blade at will.
