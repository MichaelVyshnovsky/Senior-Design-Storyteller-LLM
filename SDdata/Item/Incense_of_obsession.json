They would become self-assured that their prowess in magic surpassed all others. Beyond that, they would feel an inescapable urge to cast spells at every opportunity, even if doing so would be unnecessary or futile. This entrancement would linger until 24 hours had passed or the affected being had cast every spell in their arsenal.\nThe moralist Shahpesh was known to possess an incense of obsession."
