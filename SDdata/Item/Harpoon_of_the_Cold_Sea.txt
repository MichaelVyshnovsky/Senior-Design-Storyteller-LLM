The '''''Harpoon of the Cold Sea''''' was a unique melee weapon wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Ulutiu]], the Lord in the Ice.

==Description==
The ''Harpoon of the Cold Sea'' was a massive [[harpoon]] that required two hands to wield effectively. An ethereal tether was affixed to the harpoon's handle.

==Powers==
This weapon carried a stout ''+4'' [[enchantment]]. Once stuck in a target's flesh, the harpoon would not dislodge until willed to do so by Ulutiu and it allowed the [[god]] to yank the target off their feet like a ragdoll. Ulutiu could also cause the harpoon to reappear in his hand at any time if he wished to throw the weapon again.
