==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], buskins were common among men in the city of [[Waterdeep]] and could often be seen worn in place of walking [[boots]].

In [[1368 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} the corpse of [[Lanig]] was found wearing laced buskins when it was discovered by [[Alassra Shentrara]] and [[Ebroin]].<ref>

==Notable Wearers==
* When the [[silver dragon]] [[Azhaq]] ''[[shapechange]]d'' into the form of a [[human]], he wore a shabby brown robe and buskins.<ref>
* [[Brom Selwick]].<ref>
