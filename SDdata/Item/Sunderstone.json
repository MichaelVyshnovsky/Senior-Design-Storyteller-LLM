        "mainbody": "'''''Sunderstone''''' was a magical [[warhammer]] that belonged to [[Korin Honedaxe]], a [[dwarven]] hero who was buried with honors long before the [[Weeping War]]'s advent, in the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] in [[Myth Drannor]] and guarded by [[iron golem|dwarven statue golems]].",
        "Description": "''Sunderstone'' was a very heavy warhammer cast out of [[lead]] and encrusted in a [[steel]] external layer.",
        "Powers": "Against most opponents, ''Sunderstone'' was a fearsome weapon that possessed a ''+4'' enchantment, with the same enchantment reducing the wielder's intelligence. The warhammer's true powers were revealed when used against [[construct]]s, ''Sunderstone'' effectively became a ''+7'' enchanted weapon that also increased the wielder's strength.\n\nThe warhammer also allowed its user to cast the ''[[remove paralysis]]'' spell.",
        "History": "''Sunderstone'' along with its ancient owner were entombed long before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War. Even though the catacombs where the tomb was located were regularly raided by [[drow]], [[orc]]s, [[orog]]s, and the [[Cult of the Dragon]], in [[1369 DR]], ''Sunderstone'' was still inside its master's tomb. Along with a few other crypts of heroes in the depths of the Elven Catacombs, the ''Receiver of Respect'' was the part of the tomb. It was designed to release the legendary weapon in exchange for another mundane [[warhammer]] in times of dire need."
