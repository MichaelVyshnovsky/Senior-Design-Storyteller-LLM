        "mainbody": "anfare horns were long and elegant horns made of brass.\nThese instruments were long and conical with a simple design. The sound produced by fanfare horns was very strident and carried a heroic tone. For those reasons, their convenient shapes for bearing flags and their characteristic timbre made them the instruments of choice for state functions.\nFanfare horns were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue."
