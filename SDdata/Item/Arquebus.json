        "mainbody": "The arquebus, also known as a hackbut, was a type of firearm.\nAn arquebus consisted of a wooden stock and a metal, smooth bore barrel, which often had a hook-like projection on the underside. Where some firearms had a trigger, arquebuses had a curved piece of metal called the \"serpentine\".\nArquebuses that came from Lantan typically had the symbol of Gond stamped on the butt of their stock.\nthumb|Detail of arquebus matchlock(A) pan cover(B) priming pan with smokepowder(C) serpentine clamp(D) slow match.\nAn arquebus required both hands to fire, with arms absorbing the recoil, and unlike a musket they didnt require a stand to support their barrel. They were also sturdy enough to be wielded like a club, but they could be damaged in the process.\nArquebuses were loaded by pouring smokepowder from a powderhorn into the muzzle, firmly packing it with a piece of paper, and then ramming in the projectile (an iron ball). Once the barrel was loaded a user needed to fill the firearms priming pan with smokepowder, close it, and place a burning slow-match within the serpentine. Putting pressure on a metal plate would then release the serpentine into the pan, thereby firing the weapon.\nIf an arquebus ever backfired it was fouled and couldnt be used further until it was cleaned, a process that could take at least thirty minutes.\nBlunderbuss a variation of the arquebus that offered more versatility in terms of ammunition.\nCaviler a lighter variation of the arquebus.\nMusket a heavier variation of the arquebus.\nOn the world of Toril, the arquebus originated on the island nation of Lantan, during the Time of Troubles, after the deity Gond revealed to his followers how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder. From 1358 DR onwards, the Lantanna priests of Gond (mainly the specialty priests) would work to spread the use of firearms, shipping them to Western ports.\nWhen arquebuses first showed up off of Lantan they were considered mere curios, but after five or so years they became increasingly common. With one source being the Smiths Coster trading company, who conducted business with the Lantanna, Waterdhavians, and elsewhere.\nBy 1370 DR, one could purchase arquebuses among other firearms from The Brigadier, a giff gunsmith, in Skullport.\nIn the first three years that it was available for purchase outside of Lantan, an arquebus cost roughly 5,000 gold pieces. Through the third to fifth year, as the weapon became more common, the cost lowered to 1,000 gold pieces. Following the fifth year, an arquebus on Toril consistently cost around 500 gold pieces.\nArquebuses were thought by some to be as dangerous to their user as they were their target.\n* Lantanna rogues were noted for their use of the arquebus.\n* All giff members of the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company carried arquebuses.\n* On the plane of Acheron, a cambion by the name of Thrao was known to sell arquebuses.\n* The deity Gond was able to instantly summon a fully loaded arquebus whenever he desired.\n* It was not uncommon for giff to carry around an arquebus.\n* Approximately a quarter of any scro fighting force were likely to be armed with arquebuses.\n* In the city of Bezantur, the clergy of the local Temple of Gond were outfitted with arquebuses.\n* The armed forces of city-states in the Blade Kingdoms included troops armed with arquebuses.\n* These weapons rarely saw use in the Domains of Dread, being considered primitive by technologically advanced domains and unreliable by primitive domains.\n* The arquebus was among the weapons favored by priests of the Church of Gond,"
