A '''''glass of preserved words''''' was a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[magnifying glass]].

==Description==
These magnifying glasses had [[ivory]] handles and a band made of [[silver]] around their [[lens]].

==Powers==
Any writing, normal or [[magic]]al, viewed through the lens of a ''glass of preserved words'' would appear legible. This included things written in worn away stone, [[ink]]ed letters that had blurred due to moisture, messages that were clouded by [[magic]]. Outside of their appearance through the lens, words were not altered in any way. Cryptically worded or coded messages were not made understandable.

Those viewing through the lens were not protected against any [[curse]]s or magical traps that a writing may have.

==Notable Users==
* Some [[sha'ir]]s were known to craft these magnifying glasses.
