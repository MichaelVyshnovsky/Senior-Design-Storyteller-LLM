'''Castles''' was a strategy game, distinct from the game [[Chess (game)|chess]] that sometimes was referred to by the same name. Castles was played in the southern land of [[Halruaa]] by [[jordainis]] and ruling class [[wizard]]s alike.

{{quote|''I am in training, that is certainly true. He who would command must understand the art of war. It is no secret that games provide preparation. [[cat|Kittens]] stalk imaginary prey, and small boys whack each other with sticks in anticipation of their first [[sword]]s. What we do here is not so different.''|[[Procopio Septus]], the Lord Mayor of [[Halarahh]]}}

==Description==
The game board of castles consisted of a collection of tiny carved buildings and pieces that represented troops. Similar to chess, the goal of castles was to encircle the opponent's base buildings, forcing them to surrender.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a young jordaini named [[Matteo (Halruaa)|Matteo]] was tasked with teaching strategy to petulant young daughter of Procopio Septus, the Lord Mayor of Halarahh â€“ [[Penelope Septus]]. The girl showed little interest and accused the jordaini of cheating when she swiftly lost the game. Lord Mayor Procopio loved strategy games such as chess, castles, various card games, and magically [[enchanted]] and immaculately-crafted miniature wargames depicting the [[Nath]] and the historic battle of the [[Mycontil's Stand]]. Procopio Septus used them to prepare himself for the much-desired future as the next Netyarch of Halruaa.
