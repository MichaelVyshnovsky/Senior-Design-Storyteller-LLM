A ring of protection was a magical device that helped keep the one who wore it from physical harm. The ring could deflect a small part of most attacks.
Rings of protection were old items, and the knowledge to create them was quite well-known. A shield of faith spell was needed in the creation, so they were made mostly by clerics.
A radically different recipe was represented in the Imaskarran Tome of Death, which called for the spell of improved invisibility, a skeleton knuckle and the silk gland from an ettercap.
Even though the name of the original creator of the first rings of protection was unknown, the sages liked their origins to King Castter Dewess. Several of these rings were forged to protect the Kings sons. The rings of protection remained within the Dewess family for at least 13 generations. The hostility between the creators of the rings and the Kings heirs was the supposed reason for the rings of protection disappearance from the possession of the Dewess family.
