The cause of this discrepancy appears to be due to the fact that the item provides a "deflection bonus to AC" in this edition, per the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 3rd edition]]'' (2000).

A '''''ring of protection''''' was a magical device that helped keep the one who wore it from physical harm. The ring could deflect a small part of most attacks.

==Creation==
''Rings of protection'' were old items, and the knowledge to create them was quite well-known. A ''[[shield of faith]]'' spell was needed in the creation, so they were made mostly by [[cleric]]s.

A radically different recipe was represented in the [[Imaskarran Tome of Death]], which called for the spell of ''[[improved invisibility]]'', a [[skeleton]] knuckle and the silk gland from an [[ettercap]].

==History==
Even though the name of the original creator of the first ''rings of protection'' was unknown, the sages liked their origins to King Castter De'wess. Several of these rings were forged to protect the King's sons. The ''rings of protection'' remained within the De'wess family for at least 13 generations. The hostility between the creators of the rings and the King's heirs was the supposed reason for the ''rings of protection'' disappearance from the possession of the De'wess family.
