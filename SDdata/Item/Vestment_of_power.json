        "mainbody": "vestment of power was a magic item usually worn by ranking priests of the various faiths in Faerûn. Roughly one quarter of all mid-to-high ranking priests wore a form of a vestment of power.\nThese items usually appeared in the form of a set of ceremonial robes.\nTwo forms of the vestment of power existed—the lesser vestment of power and greater vestment of power. Both granted a variety of useful magical abilities and protections to the wearer."
