        "Description": "Even though Vilholn cherrybread was mostly made with cherries, the original dish, popular in the Border Kingdoms and Vilhon could be made with various types of fruit, finely diced and marinated in spirits. The ready bread was often sold as a whole loaf or per slice, wrapped in leaves to keep it moist."
