The '''''constellation of power''''' was a collection of hovering [[enchanted]] metal orbs. It could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
These golden spheres orbited each other, and was meant to represent the movement of stars. The creator of the ''constellation of power'', a [[gnome]] clockwork artist and ''[[wild magic]]'' [[sorcerer]] named [[Coriolis Rillevay]], made them to serve as a constant reminder of her lifelong aspiration to travel to the stars in the night sky above her native Waterdeep.

==Powers==
In battle, Coriolis could direct the orbs to fly toward and bombard a target, at which point the unpredictable objects might begin to lash out at other targets randomly.

==Notable Owners==
* Coriolis Rillevay, who worked as an [[adventurer]] on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
