        "mainbody": "An '''''animated shield''''' was a [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[shield]] that could be commanded to act independently of its carrier.",
        "Powers": "Whenever they so wished, the wielder of an ''animated shield'' could direct it to leave their grasp and float in the air for up to one minute. During that time, the shield could still protect them as if it were carried in combat.\n\nIf its carried were slain or rendered incapacitated, the ''animated shield'' would immediately clang to the floor.",
        "History": "At least one ''animated shield'' could be found in the droppings of [[purple worm]]s that traveled through the deserts of [[Anauroch]]."
