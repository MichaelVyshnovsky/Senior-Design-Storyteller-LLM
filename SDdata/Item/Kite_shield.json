        "mainbody": "Kite shields, also known as body shields or large shields, were a large-sized style of shield in the Realms that were sometimes conflated with tower shields.Some sources, such as the Baldurs Gate series and Icewind Dale series, refer to kite shields as being another name for tower shields. Other sources, such as Players Option Combat & Tactics, contradict this claim. Because the two are distinct types of shields out-of-universe, it is assumed the two were lumped together due to being similarly large shields. Also of note, the icons used for large shields in Baldurs Gate and the Icewind Dale series depict a tower shield, while the icons used in Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn depict a kite shield.\nKite shields were long in shape, with wide tops and narrow pointed bottoms, providing their wielders more coverage than a buckler shield. The pointed bottom edge of these could be driven into the ground to provide their users a stable defense against assaults.\n* A number of merchants in Athkatlas market Waukeens Promenade commonly sold kite shields, including the armorer Arnolinus, the fruit merchant Enge, the merchant Mira, and Ribald Barterman from his store Adventurer Mart. In the Bridge district, one could find them for sale from the innkeeper of Delosars Inn and at the street-side stalls of Bel Dalemark and Siochaire. And in the Wave District, one could find them for sale by the merchant Jahaboam.\n* A number of general stores in the southern districts of Baldurs Gate sold kite shields.\n* Candlekeep Inn.\n* The inn within the hamlet of Friendly Arm sold both mundane and +1 kite shields alongside a variety of armor and weapons.\n* A small armaments store in Nashkel was known to sell kite shields.\n* The Tankard Tree, a tavern in Saradush, sold both mundane kite shields and ones with generic +1 or +2 enchantments.\n* Thunderhammer Smithy, a blacksmith shop in Beregost, sold kite shields.\n* The Ulgoths Beard inns owner sold kite shields on the side, alongside a variety of general adventuring equipment.\n* The Zephirs owner Zakee Rafeha sold kite shields in his inn on the side, alongside a variety of general adventuring equipment.\n* Fflar Melruth, a captain of the AkhVelahr, wielded a stout kite shield.\n* The Shepherd of the Damned.\n* Kite shields found use in the Vast."
