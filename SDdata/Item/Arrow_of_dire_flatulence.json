        "mainbody": "rrows of dire flatulence were rare and extremely dangerous magical arrows that exploded into a cloud of noxious gas.\nThe arrowheads of the arrows of dire flatulence were thin and spike-shaped and they emitted a very peculiar foul odor.\nThese arrows were magically enchanted to deal extra damage and made it easier to hit the target. Upon impact, the arrows created a  cloud of sickening noxious mist similar to the effect of the stinking cloud spell.\nSome of the magical arrows of dire flatulence could be found in the areas of the Elven Catacombs under Myth Drannor that were controlled by the drow of House Freth circa 1369 DR."
