        "mainbody": "A ranseur () were specialized spears in the pole arm family.\nRanseurs had long, tapered tips with two wing-like projections at their base. These secondary barbs projected out at about 45&deg from the center line, but were curved backward. The base of their heads were often indented, forming a trap between the head and secondary tines. Their shafts were typically  long.\nDue to their length, ranseurs had be wielded two-handed by human-sized creatures. Ranseurs, like most pole arms, were very effective in large numbers, in combination with other types of forces, and when wielded by well-trained troops. For these reasons it was often considered a martial weapon.\n* The Ravenian merchant Bendekar had multiple ranseurs in his homes expansive weapons collection."
