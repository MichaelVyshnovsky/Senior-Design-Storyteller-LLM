        "mainbody": "'''Barrels'''  were a commonplace liquid container used in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "Barrels were used to store liquids, most commonly alcoholic beverages such as [[ale]], [[cider]], [[beer]], [[wine]], and other spirits, but also clean water. A barrel was a roughly cylindrical container made from wooden staves held in place by metal hoops. The bottom was permanently secured, while the top was usually removable but could be made permanent and cut with a plughole.\n\nWater barrel reservoirs could be set up for easy access for hand-washing and tool-cleaning in workshops.",
        "Variations": "Although different terms denoted specific capacities or designs, they were sometimes used interchangeably, or simply all called \"barrels.\"\n\n;Costrel\nA small [[leather]] \"barrel\" that resembled a large [[flask]] or [[skin]], able to be carried by a shoulder strap.\n\n;Hand keg\nA small hand keg was {{SI|12|in|long=yes}} long, {{SI|8|in|long=yes}} wide, and held {{SI|2|gal|l|long=yes}}. Without any liquid inside, it weighed {{SI|10|lb|k|long=yes}}.\n\n;Cask\nA cask was {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|18|in|long=yes}} wide, containing {{SI|12|gal|l|long=yes}} of liquid.\n\n;Barrel\nA standard barrel was {{SIrange|3|5|ft|long=yes}} and as wide as an adult human's shoulders, holding about {{SI|30|gal|l|long=yes}} of liquid, {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} of solids, and weighed {{SI|100|lb|k|long=yes}} empty.\n\n;Butt\nLarge butts were about {{SIrange|6|7|ft|long=yes}}, wider than a man, and held {{SI|100|gal|l|long=yes}}. They were most commonly purchased for castles, manors, and estates.\n\n;[[Powderkeg]]\nA type of small wooden keg that was used to store and transport either [[gunpowder]]<ref name =\"drag321-p38\">{{Cite dragon/321/The Way of the Gun|38}} or [[smokepowder]].\n\n;[[Topkeg]]\nA special form of wooden ale barrel that were designed to have a separate compartment for holding small amounts of [[rum]].{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|80}}\n\n;Tun\nFar more massive than other barrels, a tun was often mounted inside the wall and could hold about {{SI|250|gal|l|long=yes}}. They were usually built with a bunghole for a cork, allowing them to be easily tapped once installed in place.",
        "Trivia": "* In the [[Roll of Years]], the year [[-276 DR]] bore the name \"Year of Overflowing Casks\".<ref>\n* One of the streets of [[Waterdeep]] notably held the name [[Street of Six Casks]], owing to it having once been the site of six competing cooper businesses.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/City System Map & Street of Six Casks}}"
