'''Positoxins''' were special alchemical mixtures distilled with [[holy water]] and laced with [[positive energy]]. They effected corporeal [[undead]] the way [[poison]]s effected the living.

Positoxins could break down an undead's physical body, potentially permanently. Such substances also disrupted the [[negative energy]] that animated the creatures. Positoxins were harmless to all other creatures (including incorporeal undead), and as supernatural substances, an ''[[antimagic field]]'' or similar area rendered them ineffective.

Spells such as ''[[detect poison]]'', ''[[delay poison]]'', and ''[[neutralize poison]]'' effected positoxins as if they were poisons.

==Types of Positoxins==
Examples of positoxins included:

; Bloodwine : A viscous, crimson positoxin that included [[garlic]] in its creation, making particularly harmful to [[vampire]]s. Bloodwine remained in bloodstream of a living creature who ingested it for up to 12 hours, and would harm any undead that tried to drink blood from a bloodwine-laced creature.

; Boneshard paste : A pale-colored positoxen made with bone fragments.

; Celestial essence : A thick, golden substance that shown with inner radiance. It would disorient and disrupt undead creatures.

; Gravedust : A positoxin that resembled the grime found in tombs due to its gray color and dusty consistency.

; Lichbane : A positoxin the color bleached bone that was particularly dangerous against intelligent undead, since it damaged their mental abilities.

; Liquid mortality : A potent oil thought by many intelligent undead to be a legend, liquid mortality was capable of completely destroying an undead creature.

; Sunlight oil : A thin, slippery liquid that lost potency after 24 hours if kept in conditions other than bright light.

==History==
In [[1375 DR]], the [[half-fiend]] [[yuan-ti]] [[Kharantes]], used a positoxin of his own creation, called [[hsskala]] or nearkill, to render a corporeal undead lich unconscious.
