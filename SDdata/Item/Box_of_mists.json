        "mainbody": "box of mists was a rare and powerful magical artifact that could be used to move an entire marine vessel to another location, avoiding pursuit.\nWhen opened, a box of mists summoned strange, swirling, green-glowing mists. The mists enveloped the ship and its passengers where the box was opened. It was impossible to see through the globe of swirling mists. A short time later, the mists receded revealing a different location the ship was transported to.\nCirca 1377 DR, a shady benefactor of a group of pirates hired to assassinate Eidola of Neverwinter paid dearly for a box of mists to use on his mission. He did not expect to use the artifact soon after leaving the harbor of Tharkar but an ambush by a ship called Black Dragon forced his hand. Even though they escaped the pursuit by traveling through the mists, the Black Dragon found them again thanks to a magical tracker planted on board.\n* Belmer Droon somehow acquired this powerful artifact to use on his mission to Doegan."
