        "mainbody": "A '''''box of mists''''' was a rare and powerful magical [[artifact]] that could be used to move an entire marine vessel to another location, avoiding pursuit.",
        "Powers": "When opened, a ''box of mists'' summoned strange, swirling, green-glowing mists. The mists enveloped the ship and its passengers where the box was opened. It was impossible to see through the globe of swirling mists. A short time later, the mists receded revealing a different location the ship was transported to.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1377 DR]], a shady benefactor of a group of pirates hired to assassinate [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]] paid dearly for a ''box of mists'' to use on his mission. He did not expect to use the artifact soon after leaving the harbor of [[Tharkar]] but an ambush by a ship called ''[[Black Dragon (ship)|Black Dragon]]'' forced his hand. Even though they escaped the pursuit by traveling through the mists, the ''Black Dragon'' found them again thanks to a magical tracker planted on board.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Belmer Droon]] somehow acquired this powerful artifact to use on his mission to [[Doegan]]."
