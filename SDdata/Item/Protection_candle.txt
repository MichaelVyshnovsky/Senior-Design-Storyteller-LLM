A '''''protection candle''''' was a special magic item made by [[mystic]]s in the Realms. It either conferred ''[[protection from evil, 10' radius]]'' or ''[[protection from good, 10' radius]]'' on those within its area of effect.

==Description==
''Protection candles'' were blue in color and were intended to be burnt in ten-minute intervals. The longest-lasting candle that could be made burned for ninety minutes. This was the second type of candle that mystics learned to make when studying [[candle magic]].

==Powers==
After burning for the desired amount of time and then being extinguished (either by blowing, snuffing, dousing, or reaching the end of its wick), this candle granted ''protection'' from creatures of the alignment for which the candle was made. The subjects were protected for ten minutes for every ten minutes the candle was allowed to burn. The subjects had to remain within ten feet (three meters) of the burning candle for the entire time it was lit and when it was extinguished, or that application of the ''candle'' was wasted.

If the candle was created by a mystic of neutral alignment, then the effects were exactly the same as the [[arcane]] spell ''protection from evil/good, 10' radius''. If a ''[[protection from evil]]'' candle was made by a mystic of good alignment, then its protection was doubly effective, ''i.e.'', the attack penalty and defense bonus were twice that of a normal ''protection from evil'' spell. Likewise, the same held true for a ''[[protection from good]]'' candle manufactured by a mystic of evil alignment.
