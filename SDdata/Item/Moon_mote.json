        "mainbody": "A moon mote was a magical stone used by the church of Selûne that gave the power to cast dancing lights.\nIt was a small stone, round, smooth, and pale-hued.\nOn command, it could create dancing lights, which could be directed by whoever held the stone. After the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, this could be done any time with an extreme range and duration, but after the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR it only functioned once a day with greatly reduced range and a short duration.\nMoon motes were most often created by an appearance of moonfire at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess Selûne was pleased and only as she willed. It was a permanent manifestation of moonfire. These items were intended for use by the clergy.\nIt was valued at 180 gold pieces."
