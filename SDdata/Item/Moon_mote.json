        "mainbody": "A '''''moon mote''''' was a magical stone used by the [[church of Selûne]] that gave the power to cast ''[[dancing lights]]''.",
        "Description": "It was a small stone, round, smooth, and pale-hued.",
        "Powers": "On command, it could create ''[[dancing lights]]'', which could be directed by whoever held the stone. After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], this could be done any time with an extreme range and duration, but after the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]] it only functioned once a day with greatly reduced range and a short duration.",
        "Creation": "''Moon motes'' were most often created by an appearance of ''[[moonfire]]'' at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess [[Selûne]] was pleased and only as she willed. It was a permanent manifestation of ''moonfire''. These items were intended for use by the clergy.",
        "Value": "It was valued at 180 [[gold piece]]s."
