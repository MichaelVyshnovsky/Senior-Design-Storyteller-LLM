Barrels of Bamboozle were containers filled with fools gold, pyrite, that held sentimental value for Torleth Mindulspeer of Gillians Hill. These barrels were not for sale unlike virtually everything else within Torleths Treasures circa 1372 DR.
So-called Barrels of Bamboozle were several simple barrels, filled to the brim with rough chunks of rocks with what appeared to be gold permeating through them. However, it was only pyrite and held little substantial value.
These containers originally were sold by a not particularly trustworthy dwarven merchant to a local "almost famous" narcissistic sculptor Yujist Glemp. Glemp sought to preserve his likeness in gold for "posteritys sake" to the extreme dislike by the locals of Gillians Hill, as he wanted to gift his "masterpiece" to the hamlet inhabitants. The man made a poor financial discussion by deciding to take a loan from the notorious loan shark of Daggerford and Torleth Mindulspeers bitter rival, Vladmyr. Using that loaned coin, Yujist Glemp bought the "Barrels of Bamboozle," thinking it was true gold. Thinking that if he were unable to pay off the loan, Glemp could use his golden statue as collateral. When Yujist realized what he has done, he fled Daggerford in terror of Vladmyrs collectors, leaving his unfinished project behind. His space was supposedly successful, as everyone in Gillians Hill assumed him dead or mysteriously gone. When Vladmyr attempted to collect from the dimwitted sculptor, all he found were these barrels of cheap pyrite.
When Torleth found out about Vladmyr being humiliated, he laughed so hard, he decided to take the Barrels of Bamboozle into his store as a reminder of his rivals failure. The barrels were still piled at the front part of Torleths Treasures as of 1372 DR.
