A ring of teleportation was a magic item that allowed the wearer to teleport.
These rings were fitted with a deep blue gem worth 500 gp.
The user separated the gem from the ring and placed it in a location of their choosing, allowing them to teleport without error to that location by expending one of the rings charges. If the location of the gem was unsafe in any way then the ring expended four charges but nothing happened. The gem could be moved to a new location at any time.
These rings had 3â€“30 charges.
