Elixirs of bloodlust were magic potions that contained condensed savagery of a worg.
This blood-red concoction was a result of mixing together of special alchemical salts with ashes of burned worg fangs. When consumed, the potion gave the drinker ferocity of a worg that boosted the imbibers vitality and granted them strength and speed enough for another attack after each kill in battle.
*Arron, a hin druid merchant from the Emerald Grove in the late 15 century DR.
