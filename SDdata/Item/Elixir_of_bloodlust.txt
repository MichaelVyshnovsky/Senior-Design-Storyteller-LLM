'''''Elixirs of bloodlust''''' were magic [[potion]]s that contained condensed savagery of a [[worg]].

==Powers==
This blood-red concoction was a result of mixing together of special [[alchemical]] [[salt]]s with ashes of burned worg fangs. When consumed, the potion gave the drinker ferocity of a worg that boosted the imbiber's vitality and granted them strength and speed enough for another attack after each kill in battle.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Arron]], a [[hin]] [[druid]] merchant from the [[Emerald Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
