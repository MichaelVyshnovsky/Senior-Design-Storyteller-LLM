'''''Lyressa's tunic''''' was an enchanted clothing worn by an intelligent and conscious [[undead]] adventurer [[Lyressa]] from [[Suzail]] ''circa'' mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Lyressa's tunic'' was a shirt of the darkest blue color that allowed the wearer virtually dissolve into the early morning shadows. The tunic acquired a permanent strong smell of [[herbs]] that permitted the cloth over the years Lyressa used them to mask her undead odor.

==Powers==
The tunic was not particularly exciting in its enchantments; it simply improved the wearer's movement in battle, making the movements smooth and easy, even when tumbling out of the way of danger.

==History==
Lyressa wore her tunic since she woke up on a [[necromancer]]'s table in [[Suzail]], years before [[1374 DR]], when she found herself in [[Voonlar]], [[Moonsea]]. There, she joined a group of adventurers investigating the activities of the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] and one of the many deadly [[Zhentarim]] plans of seizing power in the region.
