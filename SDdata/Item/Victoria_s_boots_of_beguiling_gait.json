        "Description": "''Victoria's boots of beguiling gait'' were a pair of [[leather]] thigh-high boots.",
        "Powers": "These enchanted boots possessed magic that enhanced the wearer's dexterity and reflexes as well as increased her movement speed. Additionally, these boots allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[displacement]]'' spell, creating an illusory copy of herself anywhere within {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} of her actual location.",
        "History": "During the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading [[Army of Darkness]] and met her demise in the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victoria's gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. ''Victoria's boots of beguiling gait'' never reached the [[Underdark]] as a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs."
