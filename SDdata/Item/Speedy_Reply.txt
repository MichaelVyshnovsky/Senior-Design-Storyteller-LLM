'''''Speedy Reply''''' was a unique, [[magic]]al [[scimitar]] that enhanced the speed at which the wielder moved.

==Description==
The sword had a heavy haft and broad blade that made it resemble a well-crafted dueling [[cutlass]].

==Powers==
The wielder of ''Speedy Reply'' moved more deftly in combat. They were able to more-rapidly move around the battlefield whenever they landed a blow upon an opponent with the blade.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Speedy Reply'' remained in the possession of a [[Zhentarim]] agent. That Zhent was slain a group of [[gnoll]]s [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists]] at a cave near the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn.
