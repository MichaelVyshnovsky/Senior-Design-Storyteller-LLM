        "mainbody": "Goggles of minute seeing were enchanted Lantanese helmets, often used by the islands archeologists.\nGoggles in name only, these magical helmets, or more precisely, metallurgists faceguard helms, were designed in a distinctly Lantanese fashion. The helmets front had an intricate series of lenses that could be rotated and placed in front of the wearers eyes.\nThe helmets lenses allowed the wearer to see even the smallest details up-close. These magic lenses made the goggles of minute seeing invaluable when examining ones environment or trying to identify strange and possibly dangerous items.\nThis particular type of helmet was created in Lantan to be used by archeologists when dealing with various contraptions of old. By the late 14 century DR, these helmets gained some popularity along the Sword Coast and even the Nelanther Isles.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, versions of the goggles existed with applications in combat.\n* Naomlen Girdaur, a dwarven rogue active in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR."
