        "mainbody": "'''''Goggles of minute seeing''''' were [[enchanted]] [[Lantan]]ese [[helmet]]s, often used by the island's archeologists.",
        "Description": "Goggles in name only, these magical helmets, or more precisely, metallurgist's faceguard helms, were designed in a distinctly Lantanese fashion. The helmet's front had an intricate series of [[lense]]s that could be rotated and placed in front of the wearer's eyes.",
        "Powers": "The helmet's lenses allowed the wearer to see even the smallest details up-close. These magic lenses made the ''goggles of minute seeing'' invaluable when examining one's environment or trying to identify strange and possibly dangerous items.",
        "History": "This particular type of helmet was created in Lantan to be used by archeologists when dealing with various contraptions of old. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these helmets gained some popularity along the [[Sword Coast]] and even the [[Nelanther Isles]].\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, versions of the ''goggles'' existed with applications in combat.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Naomlen Girdaur]], a [[dwarven]] [[rogue]] active in Waterdeep in the late 15{{th}} century DR."
