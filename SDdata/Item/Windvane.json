        "History": "Vizeran DeVir, a drow worshiper of the [[Elder Elemental  Eye]], forged the spear ''Windvane'' using part of the essence of [[Yan-C-Bin]], Prince of Evil Air, in a temple known as the [[Fane of the Eye]]. He left the spear to await its prophesied bearer.\n\nSometime in the {{yearlinkName|1491}}, Aerisi Kalinoth found the spear and used it to open an elemental node to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] to summon Yan-C-Bin. The weapon was destroyed by [[adventurer]]s who used it to seal the node."
