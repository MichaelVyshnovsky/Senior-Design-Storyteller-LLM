'''''Aprons of comfort''''' were a variety of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[apron]].

==Powers==
Whoever wore an ''apron of comfort'' was impervious to both fatigue and the detrimental effects of heat, whether they were caused by prolonged adventuring in hot climates or long hours in a kitchen. In addition, those who wore one of these aprons would have their skills in cooking improved. Those with no skill in cooking would have their natural talent tapped into, granting them a basic level of proficiency.

If food ever spilled and was likely to hit the wearer or their clothes, the apron would move to catch it. If the apron's [[command word]] was spoken, an ''apron of comfort'' would clean itself of any stain or mess, appearing as new.

The effects of this apron were only active when worn.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Pauline Burton]], a performer in the [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Living City: Burton's Bouncing Bears|8-9}}
