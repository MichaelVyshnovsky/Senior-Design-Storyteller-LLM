        "mainbody": "'''Mantara''' was a food dish similar to an [[omelet]] available in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}",
        "Description": "Mantara was made by stirring [[egg]]s, leafy greens, and shavings or small cubes of various [[cheese]]s together in a [[pan]] and letting it cook until solid. The flat egg dish was then cut into wide strips, rolled, and stuffed into a [[hardrusk bun]]. Hardrusk was a small loaf of bread shaped like a bowl with a flat bottom and baked until very hard and crusty. Mantara sold for 3 [[silver piece]]s per serving at [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]] on the [[North Way]] near [[Handrornlar]], the northern gate through the walls of Khôltar. This dish was Munsrum's version of what many locals fixed at home."
