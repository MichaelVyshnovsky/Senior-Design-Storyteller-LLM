        "mainbody": "antara was a food dish similar to an omelet available in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nMantara was made by stirring eggs, leafy greens, and shavings or small cubes of various cheeses together in a pan and letting it cook until solid. The flat egg dish was then cut into wide strips, rolled, and stuffed into a hardrusk bun. Hardrusk was a small loaf of bread shaped like a bowl with a flat bottom and baked until very hard and crusty. Mantara sold for 3 silver pieces per serving at Munsrums Ready Ladle on the North Way near Handrornlar, the northern gate through the walls of Khôltar. This dish was Munsrums version of what many locals fixed at home."
