        "mainbody": "'''''Codex of the Infinite Planes''''', also known as '''''Yagrax's Tome''''', was a cursed [[artifact]] that held terrible power.",
        "Description": "The ''Codex'' was far larger than a [[tome]] should be. A pair of strong men could barely lift the tome. Deep black [[obsidian]] was used for the covers. The pages were sheets of hammered lead thin enough to fold like [[paper]]. Every page was illuminated with bizarre markings in an unknown language. The reader always found another page no matter how many times the pages of the ''Codex'' were turned.",
        "Powers": "Every power within the ''Codex'' was triggered by reading. The ''Codex'' was capable of opening a portal to any [[plane of existence]] or any location on a [[Prime Material plane]]. The ''Codex'' could summon a greater [[fiend]] to serve the reader for a full day.\n\nEach use of the ''Codex'' posed a cumulative risk of driving the reader utterly insane, unleashing a catastrophic event, or inadvertently summoning a greater [[tanar'ri]].",
        "History": "The origins of the ''Codex of the Infinite Planes'' remained unknown.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Emirikol]], a [[plane]]-traveling [[wizard]], had possession of the  ''Codex of the Infinite Planes'' at one point."
