'''Suzailian Sweet''' was a variety of sweet [[wine]], produced in [[Suzail]], the capital city of [[Cormyr]]. It was exported as far as the [[Western Heartlands]], the lands along the [[River Chionthar]], and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
This luxury dresser wine was known for its distinct bottles decorated with rings of scales around the perimeter. These thematic decorative bottles were to accentuate Cormyr's trade in [[dragon]]-themed items.
