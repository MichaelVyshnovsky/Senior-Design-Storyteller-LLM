The '''''Dagger of Safe Harbor''''' was a unique and famous [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] created by [[Gullwyn]], a seafaring merchant, centuries before the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Dagger of Safe Harbor'' possessed a potent ''+3'' enchantment that increased its damage and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. The dagger allowed its owner to cast ''[[Otiluke's resilient sphere]]'' once per day, shielding them from any and all harm.

==History==
In his long merchant and sailor career, Gullwyn witnessed countless men being swept off the ships during deadly storms, all because of a split second of fear. To protect himself while showing respect to the mighty power of the seas, Gullwyn created the ''Dagger of Safe Harbor'' that could shield its owner from all effects of the world for a short period of time. In the years that followed the weapon's creation, the ''Dagger of Safe Harbor'' saved Gullwyn's life on at least three occasions. At the end of his career, Gullwyn entrusted the famed dagger to his friend â€“ [[Valkur]] of [[Mintarn]].

By some unknown means, the ''Dagger of Safe Harbor'' ended up in the magic item collection of the [[wizard]] [[Kieran Nye]] in the far frontier town of [[Lonelywood]] in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}.
