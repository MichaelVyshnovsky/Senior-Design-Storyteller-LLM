'''Yuan-ti grafts''' were [[snake|serpentine]] body parts attached ("[[graft]]ed") to the body of another corporeal creature or person.

==Description==
These grafts were most often applied by [[yuan-ti]] to their [[humanoid]] cultists and servants in order to enhance their usefulness. and creatures who received yuan-ti grafts were considered a form of [[serpentfolk]].

Some yuan-ti would also seek grafts for themselves, viewing them as ways to immediately better themselves and improve their social standing among their peers. Some yuan-ti considered the added power that came with grafting to be a way of honoring their [[god]] [[Sseth]], and thus disdained those "lazy" yuan-ti who forewent such grafts. In some cases, Sseth was said to bestow grafts directly onto his followers in exchange for a blood sacrifice.

Yuan-ti grafts could not be reattached if removed from the recipient creature.

===Creation===
The knowledge of how to attach these grafts was known only to the yuan-ti themselves, and some experimented with grafting flesh onto their captives. The process required familiarity with healing as well as specialized knowledge of the magic for grafting flesh to another creature. [[Yuan-ti anathema]] could create grafts more quickly than others.

==Users==
Among yuan-ti seeking to raise their profiles, [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s were the most likely to pursue grafts, although they preferred augmentations that could be concealed so as to maintain their outwardly [[human]] disguises. Yuan-ti anathemas were the most common bestowers of yuan-ti grafting given that the magic came easily to them, while other yuan-ti who worked closely with humanoid agents were the next most likely to learn how to graft. Grafting techniques were practiced by senior members of [[House Extaminos]], and many members were known to augment themselves with grafted "serpent arms" which they kept coiled around themselves beneath their clothing, thus giving an impression of great girth.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a yuan-ti anathema known as [[Phelriss]] grafted arms onto the [[dark naga]] progeny of [[Calliope (naga)|Calliope]], but allowed rumors to spread that they had hatched with these arms.
