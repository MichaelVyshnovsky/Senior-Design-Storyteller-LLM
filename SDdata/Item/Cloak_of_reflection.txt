A '''''cloak of reflection''''' was an [[magic]]ally protective cloak worn by the [[ranger]]s and agents in service of ruler of [[Silverymoon]], Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand]]. Although the source of their power was unknown, these garments would reflect back upon the caster certain magical [[spell]]s and spell-like abilities that were directed upon its wearer.

==Powers==
The cloak would reflect back the following spells: <br/>
''[[color spray]]'' &bull; ''[[feeblemind]]'' &bull; ''[[entangle]]'' &bull;  ''[[forget]]'' &bull; ''[[hold animal]]/[[Hold monster|monster]]/[[Hold person|person]]'' &bull;  ''[[irritation]]'' &bull; ''[[magic missile]]'' &bull; ''[[polymorph other]]'' &bull; ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'' &bull; ''[[shocking grasp]]''  &bull; ''[[Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter]]''

The caster of any of these spells could only escape the re-directed effect if they were able to quickly move into another [[Cosmology|plane of existence]] or extra-dimensional space.

==Origin==
Originally designed by the [[mage]], [[Irentalar]], the secrets of their [[item enchantment|enchantment]] was lost to time.
