Vidrinath, or Lullaby, was a sword belonging to Tiago Baenre.
Like Orbbcress, the sword was made of translucent glassteel imbued with diamonds. The hilt was a black metal formed like a spider web. Its pommel looked like a spiders head, with two dull emeralds for its eyes.
It was later merged with Drizzts Twinkle by Catti-brie on the Great Forge in Gauntlgrym, creating a new powerful blade.
The sword was imbued with magic by a djinni. It could defeat some magical energy.
The legendary weaponsmith Golfanin forged Vidrinath in Gauntlgrym for Tiago Baenre in 1463 DR.
