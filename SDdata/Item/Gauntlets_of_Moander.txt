The Gauntlets of Moander were a set of heavy enchanted gauntlets, that were created by the followers of Moander to be used against one of his deadly foes, Tyranthraxus.
These bulky black metal artifacts  were forged to resemble ordinary heavy armored gauntlets. The Gauntlets were decorated with white images of an open fanged maw on each of the palms, similarly to Moanders holy symbol.
These enchanted Gauntlets were empowered by the mere existence of any pools of radiance. The strange and dangerous magical phenomenon was appropriated and used by Tyranthraxus, allowing the creature to travel between worlds. When they were in the presence of a pool, the mouths on the Gauntlets palms produced tentacles of light that reached towards their target. Within five minutes after connecting with the pure weave of a pool of radiance, the Gauntlets of Moander absorbed all of the magic and drained the arcane body of water. Some speculated that these Gloves could seal and destroy pools of radiance forever. Once all pools of radiance were devoured, the Gauntlets of Moander went dormant until the phenomenon resurfaces on Toril.
Apart from the Gauntlets primary purpose, they were filled with powerful magics. The wearer of the Gauntlets of Moander received magical improvements to their armor and steeled their defenses against spells. The Gauntlets also possessed enchantment similar to that of gauntlets of ogre power, granting the wearer supernatural strength. Additionally, the wearer was able to speak with plants. The main adverse effect of wearing the Gauntlets of Moander was the users susceptibility to magic and influence of the Rotting God.

Another accidental hero group assembled by Elminster in Phlan found themselves in Myth Drannor and decided to continue with the mission failed by Athans band. Saving the perilous ruins and gaining a prophesied name, the Veiled Ones eventually reached the catacombs of the Castle Cormanthor. They defeated both Kya and her ally red dragon dracolich Pelendralaar. Upon her failure, the sorceress Mordrayn was dragged into the Abyss by her dark beneficiaries, leaving only the Gauntlets of Moander where she had stood. Athan, who the Veiled Ones rescued, used the Gauntlets to destroy the pool, leaving the artifact inert once again. The Gauntlets were returned to Elminsters safekeeping afterward.
