'''''The Gauntlets of Moander''''' were a set of heavy enchanted [[gauntlet]]s, that were created by the followers of [[Moander]] to be used against one of his deadly foes, [[Tyranthraxus]].

==Description==
These bulky black metal artifacts  were forged to resemble ordinary heavy armored gauntlets. The ''Gauntlets'' were decorated with white images of an open fanged maw on each of the palms, similarly to Moander's ''[[holy symbol]]''.

==Powers==
These enchanted ''Gauntlets'' were empowered by the mere existence of any ''pools of radiance''. The strange and dangerous magical phenomenon was appropriated and used by Tyranthraxus, allowing the creature to travel between worlds. When they were in the presence of a ''pool'', the mouths on the ''Gauntlets''' palms produced tentacles of light that reached towards their target. Within five minutes after connecting with the pure ''[[weave]]'' of a ''pool of radiance'', the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' absorbed all of the magic and drained the arcane body of water. Some speculated that these ''Gloves'' could seal and destroy ''pools of radiance'' forever. Once all ''pools of radiance'' were devoured, the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' went dormant until the phenomenon resurfaces on [[Toril]].

Apart from the ''Gauntlets''' primary purpose, they were filled with powerful magics. The wearer of the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' received magical improvements to their armor and steeled their defenses against spells. The ''Gauntlets'' also possessed enchantment similar to that of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'', granting the wearer supernatural strength. Additionally, the wearer was able to ''[[speak with plants]]''. The main adverse effect of wearing the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' was the user's susceptibility to magic and influence of the Rotting God.

==History==
[[File:Mogion.png|thumb|''[[Mogion]], being [[Moander]]'s vessel, wearing the Gauntlets of Moander.'']]
The ''Gauntlets of Moander'' were forged by the followers of the god of rot, Moander, sometime before the [[elf|elves]] of [[Cormanthyr]] razed [[Yûlash]]'s temple of Moander and imprisoned the god's avatar underneath in [[171 DR]]. At some point, the church of Moander was warring with the god's foe Tyranthraxus, the Possessing Spirit. The creature was dependent on the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' magic to move between realms and grow in power. The clerics created the ''Gauntlets'' that could devour the ''pools''' magic. Just the mere threat of this artifact drove Tyranthraxus and the Possessing Spirit's minions away from Yûlash.

By [[1357 DR]], the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' were still in possession of followers of Moander, albeit in fading numbers. After the rotting god's avatar was unleashed by an adventuring hero [[Alias]], Moander reached out to [[Mogion]], the leader of his cultists. The god granted his devote followers divine gifts and commanded them to return to Yûlash and seize his temple. Even though Moander's avatar was slain by [[Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco]] the same year, the rotting god's link with Mogion remained intact. The woman grew stronger with the guidance of her master. In Yûlash, Mogion recovered the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' from the previously sealed underground temple and wore them as the symbol of her status and power. With the ''Gauntlets'' and Moander's divine aid, Mogion assembled the New Alliance that included Tyranthraxus. The New Alliance recreated the ritual of bounding creatures to their will via the ''[[azure bonds]]'', later capturing and branding a group of adventurers. The same group later allied with Alias, the original bearer of the ''bounds'' and her comrades in arms. 

Subsequently, the heroes of ''azure bonds'' confronted Mogion and slain her, claiming the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' for themselves, later, using their powers to seal the ''pool of radiance'' in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]].

The ''Gauntlets of Moander'' were entrusted to be kept safe by [[Elminster Aumar]], following the New Alliance's fall. The Sage of [[Shadowdale]] kept the artifact out of the wrong hands until [[1369 DR]]. A sect of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] found a way to a new ''pool of radiance'' in Myth Drannor and started tapping into its magic, refilling long-dormant pools in [[Phlan]] and other cities of the [[Moonsea]]. Elminster assembled a group of adventurers, led by [[Athan]], whom the old sage entrusted with the weapon against the ''pools'' corruption. The adventurers arrived at the City of Song's ruins but eventually were ambushed by the Cult's forces and their [[dracolich]] ally. Most members of the expedition were slaughtered, Athan taken prisoner, and the  ''Gauntlets of Moander'' fell into the monstrous draconic claws of [[Kya Mordrayn]].

Another accidental hero group assembled by Elminster in Phlan found themselves in Myth Drannor and decided to continue with the mission failed by Athan's band. Saving the perilous ruins and gaining a prophesied name, the [[Veiled Ones]] eventually reached the catacombs of the [[Castle Cormanthor]]. They defeated both Kya and her ally [[red dragon]] dracolich [[Pelendralaar]]. Upon her failure, the sorceress Mordrayn was dragged into the Abyss by her dark beneficiaries, leaving only the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' where she had stood. Athan, who the Veiled Ones rescued, used the ''Gauntlets'' to destroy the ''pool'', leaving the artifact inert once again. The ''Gauntlets'' were returned to Elminster's safekeeping afterward.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Athan]]: the hero entrusted by Elminster to drain the ''pool of radiance'' in Myth Drannor in 1369 DR.
