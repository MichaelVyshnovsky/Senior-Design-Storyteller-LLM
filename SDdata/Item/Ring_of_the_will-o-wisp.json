The enchantment could be activated once per day.\nLong before the , the ring of the will-o-wisp was created by Eimhec of Silvanus in order to give some protection to his underlings. The individual known as Omad the Wise was the rings first known owner. He was believed to have kept the ring until reaching the title of the archdruid. The item next was passed along to Jontan Dunmoss, who was murdered and robbed by a gang of Malarite cultists who kept the ring for several years. Finally, Hunter Renard, the Malarite owner, was sniped dead by elven sharpshooters somewhere in the northern woods of Faer√ªn.\nIn 1281 DR, the ring of the will-o-wisp was found in the Field of Bones of the White Wyrm Iceberg deep in the Sea of Moving Ice. The glacier served as the undead white dragon Icasarachts lair."
