Luskans high crime rate meant that the executioner got to hone his axe skills daily and his craft was a welcomed entertainment for the townsfolk. This axe was his only possession and he was never seen without the weapon, earning it the moniker of The Executioners Wife.\nMany years into his career, the aging axeman found a willing mistress in one of Luskans brothels who did not mind his grim occupation. Unbeknownst to the executioner, however, the prostitute he favored was a wanted thief. One day Luskan authorities barged into her home after the harlot was exposed as the notorious thief. She was long gone, and the guards found only the sleeping executioner in her room. Luskans law was swift and cruel. The executioner was implicated in his lovers crimes and sentenced to beheading. The event was held in Luskans town square, and it attracted the biggest crowd to date. The Executioners Wife descended on the executioners head, having her final say on his adultery.\nBy 1312 DR, The Executioners Wife made its way to the town of Targos, likely sold to the Gallaway Trade Depot. Deirdre Gallaway, who ran the familys trade outpost, put it out for sale the same year."
