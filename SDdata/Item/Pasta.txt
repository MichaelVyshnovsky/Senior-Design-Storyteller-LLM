'''Pasta''' was a type of shaped food made of dough and sometimes served with [[cheese]].
{{quote|''Ill effects? What kind of ill effects? Irritableness? Nausea, tone deafness, sudden cravings for pasta in the middle of the night? That sort of thing?''|[[Imoen]], when asked about losing her soul.}}

==Notable Pasta Dishes==
There were pasta dishes prepared using [[Luiren spring cheese]]. These rare pasta recipes made the cheese edible, usually unpalatable for most [[human]]s.

[[A Feast for a Tenday]] was a dish that required several days of cooking and consisted of roasted ham, tomato sauce, and served with hard-boiled [[egg]]s, pasta, and salty [[cheese]].

==Availability==
In the [[Vilhon Reach]] and the [[Blade Kingdoms]], spirelli was a known type of pasta.
