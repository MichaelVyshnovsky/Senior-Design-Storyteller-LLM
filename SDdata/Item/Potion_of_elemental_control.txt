'''''Potions of elemental control''''' were [[potion]]s that allowed an imbiber to influence [[elemental]]s.

==Powers==
Those who consumed one of these potions could influence one or two elementals within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of them in a manner similar to ''[[charm monster]]''. The chance of this working was greater when just focusing on one elemental. Elementals controlled by a [[wizard]] also had a greater chance of resisting the potion's effect.

In addition, those who consumed a ''potion of elemental control'' had a 50% chance of dispelling an elemental summoned by the [[spell]] ''[[conjure elemental]]''.

==Creation==
One of the known ingredients for these oils was some material from the appropriate elemental plane.

==Notable Users==
* These were among the magical items commonly used by [[planewalker]]s and could be purchased in the markets of [[Sigil]] at prices lower than those on the [[Prime Material plane]].
* Some [[sha'ir]]s were known to craft these potions.
* [[House Baenre]] kept a ''potion of elemental control'' geared specifically towards [[elemental earth]] in case they ever had trouble with [[derro]]s.
