        "mainbody": "'''''Rings of scholars''''' were common minor magic items found across the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Rings of scholars'' were improved versions of the ''rings of insight''. Additionally to the [[enchantment]]s that improved the wearer's knowledge of lore, ''rings of scholars'' were ensorcelled to glow with white light, illuminating an area of {{SI|15'|'\"|long=yes}} around them. They were especially beneficial in the dark libraries or dungeons, by lighting the way for curious scholars.",
        "History": "By [[1372 DR]], these common pieces of enchanted jewelry were found across many pockets, fingers, and merchant stalls across the Sword Coast, the [[Moonsea]], and in cites such as [[Neverwinter]] and [[Daggerford]]. Aptly named, these rings were popular among scholars and sages, similarly to the left powerful but similar ''ring of insight''.",
