It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nthumb|Farideh holds the sickle of shorn bonds aloft.\nSilverhand gifted this weapon to Farideh in recognition of the latters recognition of the importance of forming bonds with others.\nThe sickle of shorn bonds forced enemies to fight alone, and then punished them for it. Receiving an injury from the sickle had a chance of placing a maddening hex on the recipient that prevented their allies from healing them. It further had a chance of hexing not only the target but all of that targets nearby allies.\n* Farideh, a tiefling warlock to whom Silverhand also gifted the seal of forbidding."
