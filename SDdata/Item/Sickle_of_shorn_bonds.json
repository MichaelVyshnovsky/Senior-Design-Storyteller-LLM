        "mainbody": "The '''''sickle of shorn bonds''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[sickle]] crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Farideh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"[[Silverhand gear]]\" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "[[File:Sickle_Shorn_Bonds_WoW_wallpaper.jpg|thumb|''Farideh holds the ''sickle of shorn bonds'' aloft.]]\nSilverhand gifted this weapon to Farideh in recognition of the latter's recognition of the importance of forming bonds with others.",
        "Powers": "The ''sickle of shorn bonds'' forced enemies to fight alone, and then punished them for it. Receiving an injury from the ''sickle'' had a chance of placing a maddening hex on the recipient that prevented their allies from healing them. It further had a chance of hexing not only the target but all of that target's nearby allies.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Farideh, a [[tiefling]] [[warlock]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[seal of forbidding]]''."
