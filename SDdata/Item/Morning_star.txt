'''Morning stars''' (also "morningstar") were a simple type of one-handed melee weapon.

==Description==
Morningstars were very similar to a spiked [[club]], but with refinements. Their shafts were usually made of wood and longer than a [[heavy mace]]. Their heads were typically round and covered in metal set. Around twenty spikes were set into this metal, radiating like a star, with the biggest spike extending straight from the top.

==History==
Morningstars first became available in the [[Netheril|Netheril Empire]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1354|NY}}.

==Notable Owners==
===Individuals===
*''[[Cracker and Whacker]]'', the chief weapons of [[Athrogate]]
* The gods [[Hruggek]] and [[Memnor]] were known to consider morningstars their favored weapon.
===Races & Sentient Creatures===
* [[Bugbear]]s often specialized in fighting with morningstars.
* [[Firenewt]] [[warlock]]s often favored the use of morningstars in combat.

==Trivia==
A number of locations in the Realms were named after morningstars. These included the temple [[Morningstar Haven]] in [[Westgate]], the village of [[Morningstar Hollows]], and the road [[Morningstar Way]] in [[Waterdeep]].

Some people in the Realms bore "Morningstar" as a surname, such as [[Shay Morningstar]] and [[Thurd Morningstar]].

In the [[Roll of Years]], the year [[1350 DR]] bore the name "Year of the Morningstar".<ref>
