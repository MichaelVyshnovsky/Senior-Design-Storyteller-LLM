        "mainbody": "The seal of invention was a unique enchanted shard crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Coriolis Rillevay in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nThe seal was a small and sharp fragment of silver that Coriolis adopted as her spellcasting focus. She used it while crafting her clockwork sculptures, and marked the end of each project by using the seal either to carve her initials into the piece or to destroy it with a surge of wild magic.\nWhile using the seal of invention, Coriolis was finely attuned to finding flaws in whatever she was working on, be it crafting a sculpture or fighting an enemy.\n* Coriolis Rillevay, a gnome sorcerer to whom Silverhand also gifted the wand of essential adaptation."
