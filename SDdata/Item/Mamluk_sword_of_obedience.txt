The '''''Mamluk swords of obedience''''' were magical swords that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the [[Land of Fate]].{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

== Description ==
These swords were available in a wide variety of sword types.

==Powers==
These weapons enhanced a wielder's fighting skill, but their main power was over all human, [[demihuman]], and [[humanoid]] creatures. When struck by the sword, these creatures were charmed unless they were able to resist. Charmed creatures immediately surrendered to the wielder and behaved as if under a ''[[charm person]]'' or ''[[charm monster]]'' spell.

The wielder did not have to be a [[mamluk]] to use the sword's power.
