The Mamluk swords of obedience were magical swords that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These swords were available in a wide variety of sword types.
These weapons enhanced a wielders fighting skill, but their main power was over all human, demihuman, and humanoid creatures. When struck by the sword, these creatures were charmed unless they were able to resist. Charmed creatures immediately surrendered to the wielder and behaved as if under a charm person or charm monster spell.
The wielder did not have to be a mamluk to use the swords power.
