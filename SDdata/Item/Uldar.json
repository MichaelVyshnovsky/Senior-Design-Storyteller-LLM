        "mainbody": "'''Uldar''' was an alcoholic drink brewed and exported out of [[Eshpurta]] in [[Amn]].",
        "Description": "Uldar was a slightly bitter and highly alcoholic drink of pale yellow hue. The drink was a good accompaniment for [[nut]]s and [[cheese]]. Despite its decent quality, Uldar was considered a low-brow libation.",
        "Availability": "The [[Harfin Draether]] tavern and eatery in [[Athkatla]]'s [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]] served Uldar among its many other drinks; however, it was considered to be no better than a mouthwash by the snobby locals."
