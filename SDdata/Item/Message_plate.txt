A '''message plate''' was a [[magic item]] that could be used to send a message.{{Cite comic/The Ostus Legacy|6-7, 14}}

==Description==
One message plate resembled a [[gold]]-hued disc, wide enough to rest on one's hand, with studs around the side. A glowing, colorless, animated image of the one who sent the message was projected above it. It made a ''plink'' sound when deactivated. 

Another was a [[silver]] plate with a mirrored inner part and runes running around the border. The recipient could touch certain runes to prove their identity and activate it. It played only a voice message.

==History==
In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], the [[wizard]] [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] sent a message plate with a false image of [[Priam Agrivar]] to lure [[Kyriani Agrivar]] to the site of the [[Great Door]] on the outskirts of [[Waterdeep]]. Kyriani believed it had been sent by Priam.

In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Court Magician [[Vangerdahast]] posed as the poisoned King [[Azoun IV]] when he placed a voice message on a message plate intended for Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]]. He had [[Laspeera Inthré]] deliver the message plate to Alusair.
