The '''''Blue Dragon Mask''''' was one of the five ''[[dragon mask]]s'' that carried the blessings of [[Tiamat]] in the efforts of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] to summon her to [[Toril]].

==Description==
The ''Blue Dragon Mask'' was glossy blue in color, with spiked edges and a central horn.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ''Blue Dragon Mask'' gained a large number of powers, such as extremely strong resistance to damage from lightning, as well as an increase in the potency of lightning attacks and improvements to defense and endurance. The mask also granted its wearer with [[darkvision]] and [[blindsight]], as well as the understanding of [[Draconic language|Draconic]].

The main feature of the ''Blue Dragon Mask'' was to turn its wearer into a [[wyrmspeaker]], who could think like a [[dragon]] and was capable of subtly influencing other dragons' behaviors.

When two or more of the masks combined, they magically transformed into the ''[[Mask of the Dragon Queen]]'', which combined the properties of all five masks and granted immense powers to its wearer. The ''Mask of the Dragon Queen'' was essential in the ritual to free Tiamat from her imprisonment in the [[Nine Hells]].

==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} a forgery of the ''Blue Dragon Mask'' was in [[Iskander]]'s possession within [[Xonthal's Tower]].

The location of the true mask was revealed by Tiamat to [[Severin Silrajin]].
