'''''Sevencirclingwands''''' were magical items perfected by the [[wizard]] [[Ilcanorr]] of [[Luthcheq]].

Seven magical [[wand]]s were linked together so that a single being or trigger could activate them, even if they were not being wielded and might well be concealed out of sight.<ref>{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms| url = http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frbk/20060510a
