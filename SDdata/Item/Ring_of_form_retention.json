        "mainbody": "ring of form retention was a magical ring that helped maintain shapechanging effects.\nThe ring took the form of an innocuous silver band, to better avoid detection.\nThe ring of form retention ensured that a shapechanging effect — whether from a wizards spell or a shapechangers innate ability — remained uninterrupted and intact through circumstances that could negatively affect it. Thus, it was highly prized by those who used magical disguises. The ring was powerful enough to maintain the changed form of a dead doppelganger, which would normally revert to their natural form immediately on death.\nA ring of form retention was held by the wizard Kalris, who often used trickery and misdirection in his work. While plotting to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle, he gave his ring to the doppelganger Xixis, who was to impersonate the Lord. When Xixis was killed, the ring allowed his body to maintain the impersonation."
