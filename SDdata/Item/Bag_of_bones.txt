A '''''bag of bones''''' was an [[enchanted]] leather pouch that summoned a small army of [[skeleton]]s.

These [[magic item]]s were usable only by [[cleric]]s.

==Powers==
This small pouch contained an assortment of small bones. If the bones were scattered over an area measuring {{SI|120|ft}} by {{SI|60|ft}}, and the proper command word was uttered, a small army of up to 80 skeletons would spring from the ground. The skeletons were armed with [[sword]]s and would fearlessly obey the commands of the cleric holding the bag. When ordered to fight the skeletons would do so either until destroyed or when the sun set, at which point any remaining skeletons would crumble to dust. The skeleton army could not be split into smaller fighting groups.

The majority of these bags could only be used a single time. However, one third of them could be used repeatedly, replenishing any lost skeletons with each sunset.

==Notable Owners==
[[Noora bint Amon]], a beloved [[hakima]] from [[Zakhara]], carried a ''bag of bones''.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|376|[[Noora bint Amon]]}}
