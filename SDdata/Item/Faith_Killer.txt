The Faith Killer was an enchanted axe created by the power of sheer will and denial of divine powers.
The Faith Killer appeared to be an ordinary one-handed axe.
The axe possessed a +2 enchantment. It had a small chance of dispelling magic upon hit and granted the user a small amount of resistance to magic.
If a lawful-aligned creature not native to the Prime Material plane picked up the Faith Killer, it almost certainly suffered lightning damage dealt to them by the enchanted weapon.
Sages postulated that the enchantments of the Faith Killer were born out of its original owners, Erion the Skeptic, disbelief in gods and divine magic. Erion was one of very few on Toril who completely denied any and all deities and their devotees. He gained notoriety trying to exposed clerics as charlatans and that divine magic was nothing more than arcane or some other type of magic unrelated to gods. Sages believed that Erions conviction was so strong, it created sympathetic magical powers that were imbued onto the Faith Killer. Erion the Skeptics file was cut short by clergy of Sel√ªne who were forced to kill him in self-defense. The Faith Killer was taken by the priests, and as for Erion himself, it was believed his soul became the part of Myrkuls Bone Castle.
By 1281 DR, the Faith Killer found its way into the hands of Conlan, the proprietor of Kuldahars blacksmith shop.
