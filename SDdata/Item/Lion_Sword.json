        "mainbody": "The Lion Sword was a magic sword once wielded by King Uthgrael Aumar and given to his son Elthryn Aumar when he retired to Heldon. The sword was destroyed in 224 DR by Undarl when he burned Heldon to the ground and slew Elthryn. The broken hilt was then taken up by Elminster Aumar and used to support his claim to the Stag Throne of Athalantar."
