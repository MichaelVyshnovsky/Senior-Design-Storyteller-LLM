        "mainbody": "A staff of light was a type of enhanted staff that existed in the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering.\nActivating a staff of light required the arcane spell light to be cast upon it. For the duration in which that spell was active, the light shining from the staff would inflict radiant energy upon any nearby undead.\nStaves of light came in enchanted variants ranging from +1 to +6 and like any staff they could be used as an implement in spellcasting.\nAround the late 15 century DR, a group of adventurers operating in Tymanther were sent into an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke to recover Melnar, a member of the Gem Assayers Union that had gone missing.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of \"the old Untheric Empire\" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. Within the depths of a mausoleum in the area they found the missing Melnar, close to being experimented upon by a human necromancer that had made its lair within the ruin. Inside this room the adventurers came across a +1 staff of light."
