        "mainbody": "wand of illusion was a magic item that enabled the wielder to create visible and audible illusions.\nThis wand emitted an invisible ray that replicated the effects of the audible glamer and phantasmal force spells. The wielder needed to concentrate on the illusion to maintain it. A single charge was required for each component of the created illusion. Wands of illusion could be recharged.\nHeino, a gnome bard who traveled Faer√ªn, carried a wand of illusion."
