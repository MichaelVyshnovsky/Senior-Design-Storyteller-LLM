The Talon of Umberlee was an artifact of importance to Umberlee, the godess of the sea, which had the power to harm aquatic creatures.
The artifact was a heavy gold statue in the shape of a hooked claw. It was large enough to fill an entire treasure chest.
If the statue fell into the hands of someone whom Umberlee deemed unworthy to posses it, she would send her faithful to take it from them.
It was said that the Talon of Umberlee could be used to protect an entire city against threats from the sea. On a smaller scale, if someone with sufficient magical knowledge touched the statue, they could use it to unerringly inflict injuries on all aquatic creatures within .
Circa , the Talon of Umberlee surfaced on the black market in Waterdeep, where Dagult Neverember arranged to purchase it for an outrageous sum of money in order to use it to bolster Neverwinters defenses. He hired a privateer named Szart Tilhavar, captain of the Floating Cask, to sail to Waterdeep, acquire the artifact, and return it to Neverwinter. However, the Floating Cask was attacked and sunk on its return trip by Tidescourge pirates led by "Captain Bloodbath". Unwilling to pay any more for something he had already bought, Neverember demanded that the artifact be retrieved.
After capturing and interrogating a member of Bloodbaths crew, Neverembers agents determined that the Talon of Umberlee was being kept aboard a floating fortress known as Murdershoal just off the coast from the pirates base at Port Llast. His underling, Soman Galt, then hired a crew of adventurers to conduct a raid on Murdershoal, and Neverember gave them use of his ship called Neverwinters Pride for the mission.
Meanwhile, Umberlee had no desire to allow such adventurers to claim her artifact, and so sent her sahuagin servant, Baron Saarkrith, alongside a kraken to intercept the artifact and teach them some humility.
