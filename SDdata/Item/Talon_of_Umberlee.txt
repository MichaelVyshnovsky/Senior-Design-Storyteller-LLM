The '''''Talon of Umberlee''''' was an [[artifact]] of importance to [[Umberlee]], the [[god]]ess of the sea, which had the power to harm [[aquatic creature]]s.

==Description==
The artifact was a heavy [[gold]] statue in the shape of a hooked claw. It was large enough to fill an entire [[treasure chest]].

If the statue fell into the hands of someone whom Umberlee deemed unworthy to posses it, she would send her faithful to take it from them.

==Powers==
It was said that the ''Talon of Umberlee'' could be used to protect an entire city against threats from the sea. On a smaller scale, if someone with sufficient [[magic]]al knowledge touched the statue, they could use it to unerringly inflict injuries on all aquatic creatures within {{SI|25|feet|long=yes}}.

==History==
''Circa'' {{Yearlink|1479}},{{4e-time}} the ''Talon of Umberlee'' surfaced on the black market in [[Waterdeep]], where [[Dagult Neverember]] arranged to purchase it for an outrageous sum of [[money]] in order to use it to bolster [[Neverwinter]]'s defenses. He hired a privateer named [[Szart Tilhavar]], captain of the ''[[Floating Cask]]'', to sail to Waterdeep, acquire the artifact, and return it to Neverwinter. However, the ''Floating Cask'' was attacked and sunk on its return trip by [[Tidescourge]] pirates led by "[[Captain Bloodbath]]". Unwilling to pay any more for something he had already bought, Neverember demanded that the artifact be retrieved.

After capturing and interrogating a member of Bloodbath's crew, Neverember's agents determined that the ''Talon of Umberlee'' was being kept aboard a floating fortress known as [[Murdershoal]] just off the coast from the pirates' base at [[Port Llast]]. His underling, [[Soman Galt]], then hired a crew of [[adventurer]]s to conduct a raid on Murdershoal, and Neverember gave them use of his ship called ''[[Neverwinter's Pride]]'' for the mission.

Meanwhile, Umberlee had no desire to allow such adventurers to claim her artifact, and so sent her [[sahuagin]] servant, Baron [[Saarkrith]], alongside a [[kraken]] to intercept the artifact and teach them some humility.
