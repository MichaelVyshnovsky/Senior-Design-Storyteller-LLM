        "I come up with this idea when I was watching a big whirling storms at sea. A water spout grew up from the sea and started to suck the water out into the ether. I thought maybe if I make a spout like that, I could also go to the ether.\n|''Nadul DaRoni, inventor''\n}}": "=Usage==",
        "mainbody": "spired by waterspouts, Nadul created the air screw to achieve non-magical flight. The user was intended to sit astride a set of pedals and furiously pump their legs, turning a huge screw that caused a rush of wind. Ideally, this would cause the air screw to slowly rise up vertically in the air, with no horizontal control possible. Despite the ingenuity of the device, even the strongest and most determined of aeronauts were almost certain to lose power and crash shortly after take-off (though exceptionally light folk such as [[gnome]]s and [[halfling]]s may have actually had a chance to make it work).\n\nFollowing the development of the air screw, Nadul then worked on the somewhat more complicated and effective [[doubles wheel]] flying machine.",
