Beholder Crowns were enchanted crowns, or sometimes helmets,
Some of these crowns appeared to be old tarnished bronze headwear. These crowns usually had ten stalks, each topped with gems. Some, however, were shaped into grotesque monstrous headwear with uneven eye stalks chaotically sprouting from the base.
The Beholder Crowns that resembled full-headed helmets had a crown embedded on their tops. Just like their regular crown versions, they had eight metal spike-like eyestalks, each ending with a gem.
Each eyestalks gem was imbued with one of the beholders deadly rays. Their powers were charm person, charm monster, disintegrate, eyebite, fear, finger of death, flesh to stone, inflict moderate wounds, slow, and telekinesis. Each crown had a limited number of gems, uses, and the items completely crumbles into dust once all charges were exhausted. Each eyestalk ray had the reach of .
The helmet crowns usually had limited functionality, allowing the wearers to cast finger of death (thirteen charges) and flesh to stone (five charges) spells once a day each. Additionally, these helmets glowed with dim orange light.

Beholder Crowns were in high demand by many of eccentric beholder-worshiping cults. Sages believed that these malicious eye tyrants made their servants craft Beholder Crowns to reward their most valuable minions and slaves. However some thought this to be nothing but a rumor.
In 1373 DR, one of the Beholder Crowns belonged to an elder orb that dwelt in the sewers underneath Zhentil Keep and attempted to take over the citys Thieves Guild but was slain by the Hero of Daggerford.
Another crown with only seven gems could be found in Askilions Tower in Oreme, Anauroch, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
