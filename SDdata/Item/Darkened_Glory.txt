'''''Darkened Glory''''' was a [[magic]]al [[katana]] from [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Once a graceful blade, ''Darkened Glory'' was tainted by dark magic. It had a light blue pommel and guard, while the blade itself was nearly black in appearance.

==Powers==
The katana was [[item enchantment|enchanted]] to occasionally [[curse]] struck enemies.

==History==
''Darkened Glory'' originally belonged to a young Kara-Turan officer guarding the caravan of a diplomatic envoy. When the caravan was ambushed by [[yuan-ti]] raiders, the officer was almost immediately the only guard left standing. She defended a single wagon from several waves of yuan-ti attackers, but was ultimately overpowered by their leader. In awe of her skill, the yuan-ti leader recovered her katana. It was later enchanted by a high priest of [[Sseth]].
