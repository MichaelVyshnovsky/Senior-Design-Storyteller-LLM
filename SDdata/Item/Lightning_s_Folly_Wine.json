        "mainbody": "'''Lightning's Folly Wine''' was a variety of rare [[wine]] produced in a tiny winery in [[Tantras]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Jesperata]], an ex-[[cleric]] of [[Talos]] turned vintner, attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. Jesperata's small wine-making business began very recently ''circa'' [[1371 DR]], and she only brought two bottles to the wine-tasting and rating competition that took place at the festival. Lightning's Folly Wine was a wonderfully tasting drink, possibly the best among the contestants, despite its scant quantity. Jesperata sold a single serving of her wine for a [[silver]] [[coin|piece]] but limited it to one per person."
