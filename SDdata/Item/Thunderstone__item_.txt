'''''Thunderstones''''' were small thrown grenade-like weapons imbued with thunder magics.

{{quote|''Now here's your ultimate alarm [[trap]]. Not only does it alert everyone for half a mile around, it also deafens the intruder. It's nothing more than a big pile of thunderstones suspended in a net. 'Course, you can use a ceiling panel to disguise it a little better than that. When the intruder trips the trap, it drops the thunderstones.''|Unidentified grizzled old trapmaker}}

==Description==
A typical ''thunderstone'' was a fist-sized stone, chiseled to resemble a [[dice|die]] with every other side inscribed with magical symbols or runes. During the [[Spellplague]], and until the [[Second Sundering]] restored the world's magic, ''thunderstones'' were notably, created using [[clay]] and filled with powerful alchemical reagents..

==Powers==
Thrown against hard surface, ''thunderstone'' shattered on impact with a roaring thunderclap. The resulting sonic and concussive damage could deafen an unskilled user and the blast's resonation could be felt within the thrower's chest.

==Usages==
Some inventive tinkerers and [[rogue]]s used ''thunderstones'' to create very potent and loud traps that could be heard from half a mile. The trap itself was of simple design -- a pile of magic stones suspended in a [[net]], ready to be dropped once triggered. A typical ''thunderstone'' trap could market a high price of 2,730 [[gold]] pieces.{{Cite dragon/295/Building a Better Rogue Trap|59-60}}

==History==
In [[1375 DR]], ''thunderstones'' were used by the [[Krinth]] soldiers and [[Shar]]ran shadow adepts during the return of the [[Netherese]] flying city [[Thultanthar]] to [[Toril]] over the scorching sands of [[Anauroch]].

In the 1370s [[DR]], ''thunderstones'' could be found in a [[rhodochrosite]] bowl within the [[House of Pain]], a temple to [[Loviatar]] in the depths of [[Undermountain]].{{Cite dungeon/90/Tears for Twilight Hollow|104}}
