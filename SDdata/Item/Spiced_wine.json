        "mainbody": "Spiced wine was wine with added herbs produced in Calimshan and Tethyr. A variety was available for sale through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nSpiced wine was said to be an effective remedy against nausea, cough and sore throat.\nEach individual spice was used to make a different flavor of spiced wine. Typical flavors which could be ordered through Auroras included raisins, cinnamon, fennel, anise, nutmeg, and clove.\nSpiced wine or mulled wine was especially popular in north Faer√ªn for its warming taste and potency. This northern type of mulled wine was made from cheap red wine steeped with citrus rinds and spices."
