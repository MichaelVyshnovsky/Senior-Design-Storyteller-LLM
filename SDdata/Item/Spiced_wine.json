        "Description": "[[Spice]]d wine was said to be an effective remedy against nausea, cough and sore throat.\n\nEach individual spice was used to make a different flavor of spiced wine. Typical flavors which could be ordered through ''Aurora's'' included [[raisin]]s, [[cinnamon]], [[fennel]], [[anise]], [[nutmeg]], and [[clove]].\n\nSpiced wine or mulled wine was especially popular in [[north Faer√ªn]] for its warming taste and potency. This northern type of mulled wine was made from cheap red wine steeped with citrus rinds and spices."
