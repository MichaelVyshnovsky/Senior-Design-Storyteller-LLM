        "History": "Before [[1373 DR]], the ''Red Ruin'' earned fame in the hands of the Red Minotaur, the gladiator Champion of [[Hillsfar]] in the [[Moonsea]] region. After the [[minotaur]] was defeated in battle by the [[Hero of Daggerford]], the greataxe was taken from the Red Minotaur by an unknown person and sold for a hefty sum of [[coin]]s. Later, the magic weapon ended up in the hands of [[Zhentarim]] agents stationed in [[Iyrauroth]]'s swamps of [[Thar]]."
