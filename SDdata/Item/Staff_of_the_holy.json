        "mainbody": "Staff of the holy was an enchanted staff what most commonly can be seen in the hands of devote clerics across Faer√ªn.\nStaves of the holy were imbued with healing magics allowing the wielder to use aid, cure light wounds, and cure moderate wound divine spells. Each staff was created with a set number of charges.\nThrough the years, many of the most devoted worshipers of various gods found themselves in possession of staves of the holy, claiming these enchanted items were wills of their deities manifested in physical form. Sages thought these claims to be in doubt. However, these staves did find their way into the hands of truly righteous clerics over and over again, by accident or design. The sheer number of staves of the holy made claims of these items divinity highly suspicious.\nBy the late 14 century DR, staves of the holy were widespread across the Sword Coast and the Moonsea regions."
