        "mainbody": "A '''magic match''' was a one-use magic item that produced a small flame on demand.",
        "Description": "It was an ordinary [[copper]] rod some 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) long. They were typically sold in batches of 20 and stored in small, engraved, wooden boxes.",
        "Powers": "A brief command word caused a small flame to ignite at one end, which could be used to burn or ignite. It could not be extinguished by wind or water, but burned only briefly and worked only onced.",
        "History": "In [[Faerûn]], it was believed that ''magic matches'' had been invented in [[Kara-Tur]]. Certainly, the first of them arrived in Faerûn at around the time of the [[Tuigan Horde]] invasion in [[1359 DR|1359]]–[[1360 DR]].\n\nAfterward, [[Daltim Flamefist]] and other Faerûnian mages studied the ''magic matches'' and reverse-engineered a means of making them. Daltim wrote details of the ''magic match'' in his [[spellbook]] ''[[Daltim's Tome of Fire]]'', which he lost in [[Tethyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]]."
