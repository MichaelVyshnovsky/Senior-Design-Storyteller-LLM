Banded mail was a type of heavy armor used on Toril.
This type of mail was covered in overlapping metal bands, which were sewn to a backing of chain mail and leather armor. The bands covered the most vulnerable areas, whilst the backing protected the joints and provided freedom of movement. Buckles and straps were added to balance the weight of the mail. A pair of gauntlets were attached to such mail.
