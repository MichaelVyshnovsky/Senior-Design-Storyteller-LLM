'''''Lastri's leather armor''''' was a well-worn, weather-beaten, but sturdy [[enchanted]] set of [[Leather armor|leathers]] that belonged to Captain [[Lastri Kassireh‎]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Powers==
This leather armor was designed to be worn only by [[halfling]]s, and its magics could only be tapped into by [[swashbuckler]]s. These minor but useful enhancements included a ''+1'' defense enchantment that steeled the wearer's will.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the armor was worn by Captain Kassireh‎ when her prized vessel, the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' was sabotaged and perished in a deadly storm off the coast of [[Samarach]]. The Captain survived and changed her career to adventuring, bringing her enchanted leathers along.
