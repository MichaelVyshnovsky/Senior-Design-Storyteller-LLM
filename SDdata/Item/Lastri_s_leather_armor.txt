Lastris leather armor was a well-worn, weather-beaten, but sturdy enchanted set of leathers that belonged to Captain Lastri Kassireh‎ circa 1374 DR.
This leather armor was designed to be worn only by halflings, and its magics could only be tapped into by swashbucklers. These minor but useful enhancements included a +1 defense enchantment that steeled the wearers will.
By the late 14 century DR, the armor was worn by Captain Kassireh‎ when her prized vessel, the Vigilant was sabotaged and perished in a deadly storm off the coast of Samarach. The Captain survived and changed her career to adventuring, bringing her enchanted leathers along.
