        "mainbody": "bracer of flying daggers was a magic armband that provided its wearer with an endless supply of single-use, magical daggers.\nThe bracer had the appearance of being adorned with thin daggers strapped to it.\nAn attuned wearer could pull two daggers from the bracer simultaneously at any time, which disappeared if not immediately thrown. The thrown daggers remained solid while in flight and when they either hit or missed a target, after which they also immediately disappeared.\nThe mercenary Jarlaxle Baenre used bracers of flying daggers. He had several as part of his extensive collection of magic items, including the Blades Injurious."
