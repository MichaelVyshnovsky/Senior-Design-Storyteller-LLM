        "mainbody": "Basilisk and bread was an enchanted dish imbued with the Art through foodomancy.\nBasilisk and bread was a dish that the author called a \"sand witch.\" It was prepared using two basilisk eyes, two slices of any bread, and Death Cheese. The cheese was finely sliced with a sharp Kara-Turan blade or an enchanted dagger, to fit the bread exactly. The assembly and placing of the ingredients were done in accordance with a diagram provided in the cookbook. The eyes and cheese were sandwiched between bread slices and toasted on a source of magical fire until the crust turned golden brown.\nLike all other cookery of the foodomancy school of magic, all measurements and cooking times had to be precise, and no ingredient could be substituted or of lower quality than indicated in the diagrams and records. In case the recipe was not done properly, the imbiber could suffer several side effects of varying severity, from food poisoning to petrification.\nIf the preparation was a success, the eater received the benefits of the stoneskin spell, and the petrifying gaze of a basilisk that could be used once or maybe twice per day, depending on the imbibers bowel movements (as the magic remained in effect as long as the food remained within the eaters body and digestive tract.)\nThe recipe for basilisk and bread first was recorded in an ancient foodomancy tome called the Manual of Culinary Delights. In the late 14 century DR, the recipe was researched and recorded by Jonathan Greenleaf in his hand-written book dedicated to this culinary school of magic found in the city of Waterdeep and, eventually, in the hands of Lord Raventree."
