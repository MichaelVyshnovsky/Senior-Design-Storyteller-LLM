        "mainbody": "Parkas was clothing used to keep warm in cold climates.\nA parka was a practical garment that consisted of a one-piece jacket and hood designed to be slipped over the head like a sweater. It extended just below the waist for optimal coverage. The interior was lined with seal skin, providing insulation, while the outer layer was made of fur. The hood had a rounded shape and hung loosely over the head without covering the face intentionally. This design prevented excessive frost formation where the fur met the flesh. Although a lightly powdered frost occasionally formed on an uncovered face, it was easily brushed away. Conversely, completely covering the face lead to the formation of a layer of hard ice.\nA parkas sleeves were long and wide, allowing the wearer to draw cold hands inside and warm them against the chest. This feature provided a practical solution for warming chilly hands in cold weather conditions.\nThe thick hide of a krotter could be used to craft parkas.\n* Parkas were an essential item for the Iulutiuns of the Great Glacier. Iulutiun parkas were made from caribou or seal skin, while Nakulutiun parkas were made from the fur and skin from bears, foxes and wolves.\n* Druids were known to use parkas.\n* Parkas were commonly used by Ice Hunters\n* Vilheim Baltson often wore parkas."
