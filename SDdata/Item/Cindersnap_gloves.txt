Cindersnap gloves were rare enchanted gloves imbued with protective magics, found in the Western Heartlands circa the late 15 century DR.
The wearer of these gloves could cast the protection from arrows spell once between short bouts of rest of at least four hours. This magic made the wearer significantly harder to hit with arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other mundane missiles. However, if an opponent managed to hit the wearer, they became resistant to that damage.
