'''''Cindersnap gloves''''' were rare [[enchanted]] [[gloves]] imbued with protective magics, found in the [[Western Heartlands]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The wearer of these gloves could cast the ''[[protection from arrows]]'' spell once between short bouts of rest of at least four hours. This magic made the wearer significantly harder to hit with [[arrow]]s, [[bolt]]s, [[sling]] [[bullet]]s, and other mundane missiles. However, if an opponent managed to hit the wearer, they became resistant to that damage.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''cindersnap gloves'' was in stock among the [[Harper]] quartermaster [[Talli]]'s goods during her time accompanying a Harper hero [[Jaheira]] into the deadly [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] that surrounded the [[Moonrise Towers]].
