        "mainbody": "'''Silk bodysuits''' were used by some [[rogue]]s to eliminate noise generated from armor and clothing.",
        "Uses": "Silk bodysuits were typically black and made from a special fabric imported from [[Maztica]]. They helped the wearer to remain quiet and blend with the shadows.\n\nThe only draw-back from wearing a silk bodysuit is that they could not be worn with armor, leaving the wearer vulnerable if they were discovered.",
        "Prices": "A silk bodysuit could be purchased for 10 [[gold]]."
