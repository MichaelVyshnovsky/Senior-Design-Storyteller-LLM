        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of spheres''''' was a [[magic]]al rod that could create a magical sphere that floated above the ground and could be used to transport items.",
        "Powers": "The rod allowed its wielder to create up to three ''spheres'' per day. These conjurations were four feet (1.2m) in diameter, could be used to carry items up to 200lbs (91kg) and floated a few feet off the ground, following their creator for up to two hours until they disappeared or were attacked. When the sphere was dissipated, the items within a destroyed sphere would float to the ground just like they were affected by a ''[[feather fall]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Creation": "The first ''rod of spheres'' was believed to have been created by the [[archmage]] [[Elminster]], though many have been created since. The spells ''[[Feather fall]]'' and ''[[Tenser's floating disk]]'' were used in its crafting."
