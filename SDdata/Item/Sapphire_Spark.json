        "mainbody": "The '''''Sapphire Spark''''' was an enchanted [[amulet|necklace]] that was used to empower its wearer's ''[[magic missile]]s''.",
        "Description": "The ''Sapphire Spark'' was a delicate and elaborate necklace with deep blue [[sapphire]] [[gem]]s dangling off its chain. Each of the gemstone flickered with magic as if ready to burst into flames and warm to the touch.",
        "Powers": "This piece of magical jewelry allowed its wearer to cast the slightly more damaging version of the ''magic missile'' spell and drastically improved the spell's damaging potential if worn by a creature who had the spell in their ''[[spellbook]]''. The spell's additional damage came in the form of a ''psychic'' energy.",
        "History": "In [[1492 DR]], the ''Sapphire Spark'' was in possession of a [[bugbear]] member of the [[Society of Brilliance]], [[Blurg]], who was operating out of a peaceful [[myconid]] colony in the [[Underdark]], working to improve the living conditions of the subterranean realm."
