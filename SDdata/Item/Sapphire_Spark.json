        "mainbody": "The Sapphire Spark was an enchanted necklace that was used to empower its wearers magic missiles.\nThe Sapphire Spark was a delicate and elaborate necklace with deep blue sapphire gems dangling off its chain. Each of the gemstone flickered with magic as if ready to burst into flames and warm to the touch.\nThis piece of magical jewelry allowed its wearer to cast the slightly more damaging version of the magic missile spell and drastically improved the spells damaging potential if worn by a creature who had the spell in their spellbook. The spells additional damage came in the form of a psychic energy.\nIn 1492 DR, the Sapphire Spark was in possession of a bugbear member of the Society of Brilliance, Blurg, who was operating out of a peaceful myconid colony in the Underdark, working to improve the living conditions of the subterranean realm."
