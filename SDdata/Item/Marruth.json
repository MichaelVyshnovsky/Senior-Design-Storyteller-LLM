        "mainbody": "Marruth, also called root pie by humans and dwarves or elvish marruth, was a type of trail food pastry favored by the Fair Folk.\nElvish marruth was prepared with spiced mashed vegetables. Well-mixed mash was wrapped in fatty and flaky pastry dough, then baked glazed with a light egg wash. Once thoroughly cooked, marruth was chilled and wrapped in thick and oily waterproof rallow plant leaves. The wrapping prolonged the foods life and hindered rotting, making it perfect for the road.\nIn some taverns, marruth was served warm as a snack-sized appetizer or even as a complete dish alongside a glass of cold elverquisst.\nIn the late 15 century DR, marruth was commonly consumed by travelers on the High Road of the Sword Coast North and in the city of Luskan."
