A '''''manual of puissant skill at arms''''' was a powerful [[magical]] [[book|tome]] that could instil great wisdom and experience in a warrior.

==Powers==
A [[fighter]] or [[bard]] that studied the ''manual'' for one month not only benefited from its in-depth accounts of fighting styles, but was magically instilled with the experience they needed to take their martial skills to the next level and then some. They could not benefit from reading the ''manual'' a second time.

[[Ranger]]s and [[paladin]]s were able to read the contents, but did not magically benefit from the magical power of the ''manual''. [[Cleric]]s and [[rogue]]s found the book completely incomprehensible, and a [[wizard]] who dared scan its pages found themselves stunned and reeling as their arcane experiences were torn from them.

==History==
* The book-collecting [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] held a ''manual'' in his library collection at [[Barrenstone]].
