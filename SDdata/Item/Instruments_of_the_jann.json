        "History": "The various instruments were created to honor the ascension of each new [[jann]] chieftain of the [[High Desert]]. With each new ascension, the genie races collaborated to create a full ''[[Midani dictionary|takht]]'' of instruments including an ''[['Ud|<nowiki/>'ud]]'', ''[[nay]]'', ''[[rababah]]'', ''[[riqq]]'', and ''[[qanun]]''. It was widely believed that the genies undertook marvelous quests in order to obtain the rare materials needed to craft the magical instruments.\n\nDuring the jann ascension ceremony, these special instruments were played by the most skilled mortals in [[Zakhara]]. Some of the musicians volunteered, but others were sometimes taken against their will if their skill was great enough. The music performed by the ''[[takht of the jann|takht]]'' was said to be so awe-inspiring that the mortal musicians, as well as any other mortal within hearing range, ran the risk of becoming [[deaf]] for the next decade. All musicians were rewarded with valuable gems and treasure whose value was estimated at 10-60,000 [[dinar]]s, but the musicians were left in the desert to fend for themselves after receiving their reward.\n\nThe ''[[Midani dictionary|Amir]]'' of the jann kept the instruments until his death, at which point they were scattered to the four winds as custom demanded. As of [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} sages believed that 20-40 sets of these wondrous instruments had been scattered across the sands of the Land of Fate."
