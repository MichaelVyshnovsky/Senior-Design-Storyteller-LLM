A '''''whip of Amatar''''' was a rare variety of long [[whip]] designed by the [[dwarven]] smith of the same name.

==Description==
''Whips of Amatar'' were noted to resemble large centipedes with ringlike segments. They could be found constructed from a variety of metals, though the most commonly used material was [[adamantine]].

==Powers==
By uttering a secret command word, a whip's wielder would activate an effect equivalent to the [[spell]], ''[[stone to flesh]]'', affecting any creature or natural stone struck by it. Though a small number of these whips were known to instead possess an effect equivalent to the spell's counterpart, ''[[flesh to stone]]''. Whichever effect a ''whip of Amatar'' possessed, it could only be activated three times per day.
