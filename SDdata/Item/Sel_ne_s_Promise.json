        "mainbody": "Selûnes Promise was a mace once wielded by the Selûnite priestess Fassa \"the Melancholy\".\nThe mace was colored white and blue. The words \"Never Forget\" were carved into its shaft.\nAlready a formidable weapon normally, Selûnes Promise was especially effective against incorporeal undead. With every strike, however, there was a small chance that the wielder would temporarily lose their resolve and flee from battle.\nIn the , Fassa, leader of a band of Selûnite undead-hunters, was the sole survivor of the group after a disastrous foray into the Sepulcher of the Dim. In agony, the priestess prayed to Selûne that she may never forget what had happened on that fateful night. The Moonmaiden granted this request in the form of Selûnes Promise, which appeared on Fassas bed the night of the following full moon.\nFassa would go on to become a near-fanatical hunter of undead in the years leading up to her early death at the age of 33. During the night of a full moon, in the company of her fellow clergy, the priestess renounced her faith in Selûne, and a few hours later she threw herself off of a cliff into the Moonsea. Her mace was left behind in her room, and would be kept by the church for many years, until a later high priest threw the grim object into the same lake in which its owner met her demise.\nBy the , the mace had made its way to an Eldathyn temple in Dragons Eye."
