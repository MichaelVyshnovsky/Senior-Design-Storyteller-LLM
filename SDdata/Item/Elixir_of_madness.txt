Elixirs of madness were a variety of potion that induced madness in those who imbibed them.
These potions had a foul taste to them.
Those who imbibed one of these elixirs were afflicted with madness, similarly to the wizard spell confusion. Once a creature became afflicted by it, the rest of the liquid within an elixir of madness became inert. This state of being could be removed from the afflicted by means of a heal, restoration, or wish spell.
One often-used component for making an elixir of madness was the green powder that was left behind when ankheg eggs disintegrated after a lack of oxygen.
Paste of madness The people of Serôs had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion, suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a paste of madness consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either clamshells or flexible tubes made from eelskin.
