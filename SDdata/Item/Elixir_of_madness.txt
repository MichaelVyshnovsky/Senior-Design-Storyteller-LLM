'''''Elixirs of madness''''' were a variety of [[potion]] that induced madness in those who imbibed them.

==Description==
These potions had a foul taste to them.

==Powers==
Those who imbibed one of these elixirs were afflicted with madness, similarly to the [[wizard]] [[spell]] ''[[confusion]]''. Once a creature became afflicted by it, the rest of the liquid within an ''elixir of madness'' became inert. This state of being could be removed from the afflicted by means of a ''[[heal]]'', ''[[restoration]]'', or ''[[wish]]'' spell.

==Creation==
One often-used component for making an ''elixir of madness'' was the green powder that was left behind when [[ankheg]] eggs disintegrated after a lack of oxygen.<ref>

==Varieties==
;''Paste of madness'': The people of [[Serôs]] had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion,<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|77}} suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a ''paste of madness'' consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either [[clam]]shells or flexible tubes made from [[eel]]skin.<ref>

==Notable Users==
* [[Keilier]], an evil wizard in [[Waterdeep]].<ref>
