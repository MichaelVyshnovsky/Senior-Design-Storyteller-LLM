        "mainbody": "'''Tortilla''' was a flat [[bread]] made of coarse-grained [[mayz]]. It was traditionally baked in [[Maztica]] and was available for purchase in [[Faer√ªn]] through [[Aurora's Emporium]].",
        "Description": "Tortillas were baked on hot stone griddles and could be consumed plain, with [[spices]], wrapping meat or beans, baked with [[cheese]] or fried in [[oil]].\n\nTortillas purchased through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' were shipped from the Temple of [[Helm]] at [[Ulatos]]. Part of the profits was donated to the temple in order to assist the indigenous population with medical care and education.\n\nA particular recipe involved cutting tortillas into triangles, frying them in oil, and then dusting them with ground [[pepper]]."
