        "mainbody": "Tortilla was a flat bread made of coarse-grained mayz. It was traditionally baked in Maztica and was available for purchase in Faer√ªn through Auroras Emporium.\nTortillas were baked on hot stone griddles and could be consumed plain, with spices, wrapping meat or beans, baked with cheese or fried in oil.\nTortillas purchased through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue were shipped from the Temple of Helm at Ulatos. Part of the profits was donated to the temple in order to assist the indigenous population with medical care and education.\nA particular recipe involved cutting tortillas into triangles, frying them in oil, and then dusting them with ground pepper."
