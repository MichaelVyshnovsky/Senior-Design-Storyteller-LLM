'''Caviar''', or '''roe''', were '''fish eggs''' harvested from several species of [[fish]] and used as flavorful food, usually smoked

==Availability==
Some of the fish that produced roe used as food included [[hammerscale]] – an extremely expensive and valuable variety, Sturgeon from the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] in the [[Frozenfar]] was valued for its caviar, small [[egg]]s, black in color. [[Sea urchin]] roe was also a popular food item across Faerûn and on the [[Sword Coast]].

Fish eggs were considered more of an exotic delicacy in the city of [[Westgate]] and were sold in the fish markets of [[Ravens Bluff]] just outside of the City Gates. Inhabitants of the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], enjoyed [[biscuit]]s spread with fish roe from [[The Elfstone Tavern]].

The city of [[Kwachow]] – the City of Melons, of the [[Merket Depression]] in the [[Hordelands]], produced smoked sturgeon and caviar, exporting it to [[Rashemen]] and [[Murghôm]], where it was a prized delicacy, popular among the courtiers. Similarly, salted caviar was eaten by the nobility of [[Arrabar]] in [[Chondath]]. Another major exporter of caviar was [[Lapaliiya]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. [[Lushpool]]'s freshwater fish roe was considered a delicacy across [[Faerûn]] and brought Lapaliiya much wealth.

The [[Nubari (ancient)|Ancients]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] brought caviar to their cities via ''[[spelljammer]]s'' in the region's past.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Snake Time/Certificates}}
