The Wanderers rings were enchanted rings used by traveling arcane spellcasters and used as a trade commodity by Thayan Enclaves across the Sword Coast.
The Wanderers rings were enchanted to allow their wearers memorization of additional wizard spells of lower to intermediate complexity, one per level.
By the later 14 century DR, Thay was blossoming commercially under guidance to the Zulkir of Necromancy Szass Tam. The Thayan Enclaves across the Sword Coast made a profit by creating and selling valuable enchanted pieces of jewelry. One such type of magical bobble was the Wanderers ring. These rings were popular and brought profit due to high demand among many traveling wizards who wanted access to an increased number of memorized spells.
The original design was developed by a young but talented Red Wizard Johan Kist sometime before 1372 DR. The young wizards apprentice attempted to steal the prototype and sell it as his own invention. Eventually, Johan Kist discovered the theft and tracked down his wayward apprentice. In retaliation, the Red Wizard quickly created a new spell that peeled the targets skin away from their flesh in small strips. Kist tested the effectiveness of the spell on the thieving apprentice but refused to share the spell with others.
By 1372 DR, many of these popular and valued rings could be found across many locations across the Sword Coast.
