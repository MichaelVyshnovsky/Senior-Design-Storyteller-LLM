'''Tower shields''', also known as '''body shields''' or '''large shields''', were a large-sized style of [[shield]] in the Realms that were sometimes conflated with [[kite shield]]s.<ref group="note" name="kite">Some sources, such as the [[Baldur's Gate series]] and [[Icewind Dale series]], refer to [[kite shield]] as being another name for tower shields. Other sources, such as [[Player's Option: Combat & Tactics]], contradict this claim. Because the two are distinct types of shields out-of-universe, it is assumed the two were lumped together due to being similarly large shields.

==Description==
Tower shields were big in size For many races this meant an average height of around {{SIrange|4|6|ft}},

Due to the massive size relative to their users, wielding a tower shield required fastening it to one's forearm and firmly gripping it with the shield hand at all times.
