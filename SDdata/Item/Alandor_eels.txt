'''Alandor eels''' was a dish made using the animals of the same name that were abundant in the [[Alandor River]] in [[Zehoarastria]] region of [[Amn]].

==Description==
Alandor eels were big black eels found in the Alandor River, with the [[brownscale]] fish being their main prey. Alandor eels were fished using [[worm]] ball bait by the locals off of bridges and docks and prepared into a dish of questionable taste. Alandor eels were cooked in handfuls of [[pepper]] and drowned in [[lemon]] juice.

==History==
In his guide to the [[Lands of Intrigue]], published in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], famous (or infamous) writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] described the honor of eating Alandor eels. He thought the creatures to be disgusting and the dish to be rubbery and tasting like dead fish despite all the peppercorns and lemon acid.
