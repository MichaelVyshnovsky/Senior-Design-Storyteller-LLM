If an ordinary shrub was planted in this pot and left to grow for at least 30 days, the shrub was transformed into an [[awakened shrub]]. The awakened shrub woke and left the pot, destroying it in the process as its roots broke through. The awakened shrub was friendly towards the individual who planted it."
