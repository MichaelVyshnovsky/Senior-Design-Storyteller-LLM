        "mainbody": "Earblades were a rogues last chance to beat the noose.\nBy far, hanging was the most popular method for the execution of criminals. With an earblade attached, a guilty thief had a small chance to cut or weaken the rope tied around his neck, allowing for a slim chance of escape. One earblade was typically worn on each ear since the rope would be placed on either side of the thieves neck.\nAuroras Emporium offered a money-back guarantee to any thief not completely satisfied with the performance of this product. \nA single earblade cost 1 silver piece, but most smart thieves purchased one for each ear."
