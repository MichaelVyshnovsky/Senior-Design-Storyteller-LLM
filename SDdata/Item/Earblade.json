        "mainbody": "'''Earblades''' were a [[rogue]]'s last chance to beat the noose.",
        "Uses": "By far, hanging was the most popular method for the execution of criminals. With an earblade attached, a guilty thief had a small chance to cut or weaken the [[rope]] tied around his neck, allowing for a slim chance of escape. One earblade was typically worn on each ear since the rope would be placed on either side of the thieves' neck.\n\n[[Aurora's Emporium]] offered a money-back guarantee to any thief not completely satisfied with the performance of this product.",
        "Prices": "A single earblade cost 1 [[silver piece]], but most smart thieves purchased one for each ear."
