'''Rivets''' were metal fasteners that were used to join fabrics, leather, metal, and other materials. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]], [[nail]]s, and [[spike]]s.

==Description==
Rivets somewhat resembled nuts and bolts, though instead of combining two separate components a rivet was a single piece, like a nail. A particularly durable and resilient version of rivet was made from an [[adamantine]] alloy.

==Usage==
* [[Brigandine]] armor was created by riveting metal plates onto fabric or leather layers, creating a cheap and effective composite armor. The combined plates of [[field plate]] were typically held together by rivets, as were the component strips of metal used in [[splint mail]]. The curiously effective [[studded leather]] armor also used rivets, though instead of holding protective metal plates together, the rivets themselves were the defense.WARNING: The use of rivets as a primary defensive feature, as in studded leather, is impractical and ahistorical, and should not be attempted in real life. Taking a strong impact upon a rivet attached to flexible materials such as a soft leather jerkin may result in severe bruising or cuts as the rivet is driven mercilessly into your flesh.
* After [[wire]] was coiled into rings on a [[lathe]] and combined into interleaved links, tiny rivets would be used to pin the loops closed, creating [[chain mail]].
* [[Thaluud stone armor]] was a peculiar form of armor made for [[tomb tapper]]s to wear. It consisted of large stone plates held together with rivets and [[hinge]]s.
* The [[Temple of Gond (Bezantur)|Temple of Gond]] in [[Bezantur]] was made out of enormous [[iron]] plates held together with massive rivets, among other features.

==History==
Rivets were an early human invention, being used by the ancient [[Netherese]] and [[Calishite]]s.
