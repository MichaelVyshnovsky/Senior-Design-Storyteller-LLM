Iol, also known as violet stone, was the name by which iolite (cordierite) was commonly known in the Realms. Such stones were sacred to Deneir, the Scribe of Oghma.
This semi-precious stone was predominately blue in hue, but its color changed with viewing angle, from dark blue to straw-yellow. Small iols could be transparent but larger stones tended to have inclusions that could cause a star-like effect or, in the case of trapped hematite crystals, a flash of golden color much like sunstones. Iols were usually facet-cut to best display the stones color change. A typical iol had a base value of 50 gp.
Iol stones were the best component for use in making ioun stones.
Faer√ªnian legends said this gemstone had a strong affinity for magic, but few knew of its connection to ioun stones.
