'''Iol''', also known as '''violet stone''', was the name by which '''[[wikipedia:en:iolite|iolite]]''' ('''[[wikipedia:en:cordierite|cordierite]]''') was commonly known in the Realms. Such stones were sacred to [[Deneir]], the Scribe of [[Oghma]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}

==Description==
This [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] was predominately blue in hue, but its color changed with viewing angle, from dark blue to straw-yellow. Small iols could be transparent but larger stones tended to have inclusions that could cause a star-like effect or, in the case of trapped [[hematite]] crystals, a flash of golden color much like [[sunstone (gem)|sunstones]]. Iols were usually [[wikipedia:facet|facet-cut]] to best display the stone's color change. A typical iol had a base value of 50 gp.

==Powers==
Iol stones were the best component for use in making ''[[ioun stone]]s''.

==Rumors and legends==
Faer√ªnian legends said this gemstone had a strong affinity for [[magic]], but few knew of its connection to ''ioun stones''.
