Ice arrows, also known as Arrows of Ice or freezing arrows, were arrows enchanted with cold magics, common throughout the Realms.
Their tips were cold, creating curling vapors, reminiscent of a breath on a cold winters day. Some had shafts crafted from unmelting ice.
These missiles were enchanted to burst into a ball of magical ice and cold on striking a target. Upon impact, an ice arrow exploded in a shock of freezing energy that traveled through the target, simultaneously burning and numbing them. This could have the effect of slowing their movements.
These magic arrows were in wide use throughout North Faer√ªn, in Icewind Dale and the Spine of the World.
