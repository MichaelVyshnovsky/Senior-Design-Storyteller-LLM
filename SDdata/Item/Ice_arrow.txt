'''''Ice arrows''''', also known as '''Arrows of Ice''' or '''''freezing arrows''''', were [[arrow]]s [[enchanted]] with cold magics, common throughout the [[Faerûn|Realms]].

==Description==
Their tips were cold, creating curling vapors, reminiscent of a breath on a cold winter's day. Some had shafts crafted from unmelting ice.

==Powers==
These missiles were enchanted to burst into a ball of magical ice and cold on striking a target. Upon impact, an ''ice arrow'' exploded in a shock of freezing energy that traveled through the target, simultaneously burning and numbing them. This could have the effect of slowing their movements.

==History==
These magic arrows were in wide use throughout [[North Faerûn]], in [[Icewind Dale]] and the [[Spine of the World]].
