A '''''fire elemental gem''''' was a [[magic item]] to summon and control a [[fire elemental]].

==Description==
To create a ''fire elemental gem'', a well-cut, faceted [[gem]] of red, pink, orange, or amber hue was used.

==Powers==
There were two versions of ''fire elemental gems''. The first worked like a ''[[brazier of commanding fire elementals]]''. The former allowed the summoning of a fire elemental from any fire source. The second was a one-shot item that was cheaper but needed to be crushed, smashed, broken, or otherwise destroyed to work. On crushing a ''[[summon monster]]''â€“effect that was stored in the gem was released and, because it was attuned to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], a fire elemental appeared.

Once called, the fire elemental did not attack the user of the gem, provided the gem was openly shown to them, if the non-one-shot version was used. The reason for this behavior was that the fire elemental preferred returning to its home in the Elemental Plane of Fire over attacking the user. If the one-shot version was used, the fire elemental was like one summoned by a ''summon monster'' [[spell]] and therefore under the complete control of the user.

There were no requirements to use a ''fire elemental gem''.

To create a ''fire elemental gem'', a ''[[summon monster III]]'' spell or higher was needed, depending on how strong the elemental to be summoned was supposed to be.

==History==
''Fire elemental gems'' were magic items associated with the [[drow]].
