'''Green sleeping dust''' was a drug that caused a creature to fall asleep.

It was made from parts of the [[bija tree]], which was found in the [[Quang Muku Forest]] in [[Koryo]], [[Kara-Tur]]. It was incredibly potent—a person who inhaled the dust could not resist falling asleep.

Around [[1357 DR]], its main users were [[ninja]] in service to the [[Soretyo]] family of [[Foo Nakar]], a city within the Quang Muku. Some merchants with illicit dealings could purchase it as well, though it was very expensive.

Green sleeping dust may have been used by the "nameless ones" — ninja — who kidnapped [[Meo Li]] around [[1350 DR]]. She recalled a "magic powder", blown like a "puff of smoke" in her face, and knew nothing more.{{Speculation}}
