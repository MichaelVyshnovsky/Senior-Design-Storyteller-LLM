'''''Necklaces of elemental augmentation''''' were pieces of [[enchanted]] [[tourmaline]] jewelry created to argument a spellcaster's [[cantrip]] magic sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Tourmaline stone inlaid in the necklace radiated heat, almost too hot to wear. This internal energy was the enchantment that strengthened certain types of cantrips. All cantrip [[spell]]s that dealt [[acid]], cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage had their damage output increased in accordance with the caster's spellcrafting prowess.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''necklace of elemental augmentation'' belonged to the Inquisitor [[W'wargaz]] of [[Cr√®che Y'llek]]. The magic jewelry was stored in W'wargaz's quarters in the ruined Rosymorn Monastery.
