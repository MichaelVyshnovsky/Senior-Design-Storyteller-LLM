'''Wine''' was an alcoholic beverage popular throughout the [[Faerûn|Realms]]. Most wines were poured into wooden [[cask]]s for transport. The casks were then tapped by innkeepers or other consumers. Some [[monasteries]] experimented with bottling alcoholic beverages such as wines and some merchants were known to bottle wine from casks.{{Cite dragon/407/Eye on the Realms: A Surprising Vintage}}
