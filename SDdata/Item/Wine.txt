Wine was an alcoholic beverage popular throughout the Realms. Most wines were poured into wooden casks for transport. The casks were then tapped by innkeepers or other consumers. Some monasteries experimented with bottling alcoholic beverages such as wines and some merchants were known to bottle wine from casks.
