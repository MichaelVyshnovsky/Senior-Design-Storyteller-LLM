        "mainbody": "The '''''scimitar of shame''''' was a [[magic weapon]] that originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.",
        "Description": "These weapons were available in a wide variety of [[scimitar]]s.",
        "Powers": "A ''scimitar of shame'' was magically enhanced to make striking and injuring opponents easier compared to using a normal weapon. Upon command the wielder could activate the weapon's true powerâ€”unleashing a magical assault on the target's honor. If they target was unable to resist this onslaught then they behaved as if under the influence of a ''[[taunt]]'' spell, immediately rushing to attack the wielder of the scimitar with no regard for their surroundings. These magical taunts also interrupted spellcasting or other similar activities."
