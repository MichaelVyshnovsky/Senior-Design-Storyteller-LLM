Upon command the wielder could activate the weapons true powerâ€”unleashing a magical assault on the targets honor. If they target was unable to resist this onslaught then they behaved as if under the influence of a taunt spell, immediately rushing to attack the wielder of the scimitar with no regard for their surroundings. These magical taunts also interrupted spellcasting or other similar activities."
