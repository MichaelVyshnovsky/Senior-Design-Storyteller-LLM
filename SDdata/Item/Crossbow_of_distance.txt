A crossbow of distance was an enchanted crossbow capable of firing bolts to greater distances than their mundane counterparts.
These weapons came in various forms and appeared to be normal crossbows.
Any bolt fired from a crossbow of distance had its effective range doubled.
Lord Orgauth, the ruler of Zhentil Keep following the citys fall in the late 14 century DR, carried a crossbow of distance.
