'''Assassin vine wine''' was a [[wine]] brewed from the berries of the murderous [[assassin vine]].

==Description==
The berries were tough and bitter, yet hearty. They made for a heady wine.

==History==
Five casks of assassin vine wine were kept by the [[Shar]]ran cultists at the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. It was rather cheap.
