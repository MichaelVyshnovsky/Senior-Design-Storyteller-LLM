        "mainbody": "'''''Corellon's Grace''''' was the name given to a [[magic]]al [[staff]] of [[elven]] creation that offered significant protection to its wielder.",
        "Description": "The staff was crafted to be light and easy to maneuver in its wielders hands. It was inscribed with arcane sigils of [[mithral]], markings that helped channel the staff's magical properties.",
        "Powers": "If the wielder of the staff chose not to encumber themselves with any form of armor, they were granted extraordinary instincts and enhanced inherent defenses. Their physical reflexes, intellectual fortitude, physical constitution, and other capabilities were all enhanced when faced with incoming danger or potential harm.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Auntie Ethel]], a [[hag]] from the [[putrid bog]] of the [[Sword Coast]] that somehow came into possession of the staff."
