Beneath this illusion was an unholy symbol of Shar, a black disc of jet within a ring of purple amethysts.\nA shadow illusion was laid on the disc of secrets this was partially real and could not be disbelieved. The command phrase, \"Reveal your secret to no one\", ironically revealed its true appearance.\nIn all respects, a disc of secrets served as an unholy symbol of Shar in the hands of one of her clerics. The magics only purpose was to conceal this fact.\nUniquely, a disc of secrets belonging to Shan Thar, a cleric of Cyric, bore a second illusion. Speaking the command word \"lies\" after the first command phrase caused the jawless white skull to appear within the black disc.\nFashioning a disc of secrets required knowledge of the shadow conjuration spell and a mastery of Shadow Weave magic.\nDiscs of secrets were employed by the clerics of Shar and Cyric behind the false Temple of Mystra in Wheloon and those involved in operations in the Vast Swamp, in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.\n* Naedaenya Arthas\n* Deinyn Fembrys\n* Bestra Mornscroll\n* Ketsarra Shadowscale\n* Shan Thar"
