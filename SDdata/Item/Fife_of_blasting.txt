'''''Fifes of blasting''''' were wind instruments [[enchanted]] with offensive sonic [[magic]]s.

==Description==
''Fifes of blasting'' appeared as small mundane [[flute]]s.

==Powers==
When blown into, these fifes produced a damaging burst of ultrasonic sound. This effect was similar to the effects of the ''[[sound burst]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these instruments were available from vendors who dealt in magic goods. Some could be found in the markets of [[Neverwinter]]. One of the vendors who owned a ''fife of blasting'' was [[Tarmas]] of the [[Mere of Dead Men]].
