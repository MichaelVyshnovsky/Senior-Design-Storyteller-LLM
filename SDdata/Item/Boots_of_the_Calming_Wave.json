        "Powers": "''Boots of the Calming Wave'' were created to enhance monks' defensive dodging abilities.",
        "History": "The Order of the Calming Wave was founded by a group of ex-pirates after they survived a particularly dangerous storm while in the sea. The pirate ship's [[cleric]] claimed the storm was [[Umberlee]]'s wrath and only [[Valkur]] looked at them favorably. The survivors of the storm, by Valkur's blessing, decided to abandon their pirating ways and devoted themselves to the Captain of the Waves' religion, promoting his will.\n\nAfter the [[Wailing Death]] of [[1372 DR]], these boots could be found in places along the [[Sword Coast]] and islands of the [[Sea of Swords]] frequented by pirates and sailors."
