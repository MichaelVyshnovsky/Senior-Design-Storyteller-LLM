        "mainbody": "Dragonbane amber was a type of magical amber crystal usually found underground in Laerakond.\nThe dragonbane amber had the quality to greatly weaken any nearby dragons to the point of killing them if exposed to the crystal during prolonged periods of time, hence the name. \nSmall quantities of dragonbane amber were uncovered after the Spellplague transported Laerakond to Toril, Eventually, however, the reserves of dragonbane amber were depleted and dragons were able to retaliate and destroy the rebels.\nIn the 15th century DR, many adventurers and dragonslayers braved the dangerous lands of Skelkor and other dragon ruled nations in hopes to find new veins of dragonbane amber."
