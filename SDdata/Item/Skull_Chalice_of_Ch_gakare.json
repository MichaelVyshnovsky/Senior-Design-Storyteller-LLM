        "Description": "The chalice was constructed from a [[human]] skull and encrusted with [[gem|jewels]]. In the 1490s [[DR]], it had an intrinsic value estimated at 2,500 [[gold piece]]s, but collectors in large cities might have bid as much as 10,000 gp to own it.",
        "History": "The skull used in its construction was reputedly from an ancient king of Omu that was beheaded by the hero [[Ch'gakare]] after riding a [[mastodon]] out of the [[Nine Hells]]. It was desired by princess [[Mwaxanar√©]] to help solidify her claim to the throne of Omu."
