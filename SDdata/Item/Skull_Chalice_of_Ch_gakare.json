        "mainbody": "he Skull Chalice of Chgakare () was a legendary, but non-magical, artifact used as a symbol of office for the rulers of Omu in Chult.\nThe chalice was constructed from a human skull and encrusted with jewels. In the 1490s DR, it had an intrinsic value estimated at 2,500 gold pieces, but collectors in large cities might have bid as much as 10,000 gp to own it.\nThe skull used in its construction was reputedly from an ancient king of Omu that was beheaded by the hero Chgakare after riding a mastodon out of the Nine Hells. It was desired by princess Mwaxanar√© to help solidify her claim to the throne of Omu."
