        "mainbody": "The '''''Mask of Aberration''''' was an [[artifact]] known within the ancient [[Imaskar Empire]]. It was once thought to be one of the ''[[Imaskarcana]]''.In its initial appearance, it was an ''[[Imaskarcana]]''; one of its sister artifacts amongst the ''[[Faces of Madness]]'' is referred to as a ''False Imaskarcana'' on ''The Grand History of the Realms'', retconning it as no longer an Imaskarcana, since the official Imaskarcana have been revealed as predating them.",
        "History": "An alliance of Imaskari archwizards known as the Cabal of Madness created a number of masks known as the ''[[Faces of Madness]]'', each themed around a school of magic, over decades after striking a bargain with horrors from beyond their world. The ''Mask of Aberration'' was one of them. Each of those major artifacts were created with a curse that only the creator knew how to avoid. Before they were able to implement their plans, however, the [[Mulan]] rebelled with the aid of their gods, ultimately destroying Imaskar as a nation. In the resulting tumult, the masks were scattered.",
        "Appearance": "The ''Mask of Aberration'' was a ghastly patchwork of the skin of creatures altered by transmutation magic. It wrapped around the wearer's head and was buttoned up the back. The patchwork bits moved around randomly at unpredictable times.",
        "Powers": "The ''Mask of Aberration'' granted an overwhelmingly powerful resistance to all spells of the Transmutation school. It allowed the user to cast such spells with an amazing level of penetration of innate resistances. The wearer could also employ ''[[passwall]]'' thrice a day, or more, depending on their force of personality. They were also granted a continuous ability to walk up walls and even across the ceiling, as per a ''[[spider climb]]'' spell. Finally, they got the ability to cast, thrice a day, their choice of ''[[haste]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[iron body]]'', and ''[[Tenser's transformation]]''.<ref group=\"note\">The article references ''Tenser's Transmutation''. There is no such spell; it is assumed to be an error.{{Cite dragon/281/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Imaskarcana: Faces of Magic}}\n\nHowever, every time the mask was donned, a wearer ran the risk of being transformed into a [[gibbering mouther]] were their fortitude to fail them, eliminating their original memories and personalities in the process. Though a ''[[polymorph other]]'' spell could restore their form, their memories would require a ''[[limited wish]]'' or ''[[remove curse]]'' cast with at least the same level of power as the mask itself commanded in order to be restored."
