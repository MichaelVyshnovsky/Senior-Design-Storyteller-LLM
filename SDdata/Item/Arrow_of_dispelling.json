        "mainbody": "Arrows of dispelling were enchanted arrows that were especially useful when used against spellcasters.\nEven though their magic did not deal additional damage, arrows of dispelling possessed an invaluable enchantment that dispelled any magics that were in effect on the target.\nBy the mid and late 14 century DR, arrows of dispelling were used across the Sword Coast. Halbazzer Drin of Sorcerous Sundries carried arrows of dispelling in stock in Baldurs Gate."
