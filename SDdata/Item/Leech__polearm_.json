        "mainbody": "eech was a cursed polearm found in the centre west of Darkmoons silver tower.\nIn combat, the polearm would make its owner miss more often than they would with a regular polearm, equivalent to a weapon with a -2 enchantment.\nThe room containing Leech could only be found via a secret mechanism in a room full of flying snakes. Once the button was located and pressed, a door would swing upon, revealing the cursed polearm.\nEither Leech or Hunger was required as the key to solving a riddle, requested by an animated mouth. Once the weapon was fed to the mouth, it was possible to progress further into Temple Darkmoon."
