        "mainbody": "A '''''speaking gem''''' or '''''ahlrekauth''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[gem]] made by [[elves]] that allowed them to communicate at a distance, and which held voice messages from ancient times. They were all but unknown by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The most ancient of ''ahlrekauth'' were elven voice records, some of them more ancient than some celestial bodies. The process to awaken their voices, however, was esoteric even among the magically accomplished loremasters.{{Cite dragon/418/History Check|6}}\n\nOn [[Evermeet]], a different kind of ''speaking stone'' was used to communicate.",
        "History": "''Ahlrekauth'' were some of the most ancient sources known to have been created by [[elves]]. One particular pair of ancient ''speaking stones'' in Evermeet was keyed to [[Chandrelle Durothil]] and to [[Brindarry Nierde]]; Chandrelle's stone belonged to her father.\n\nUntil {{yearlink|1373}}, the [[song dragon]] [[Ammaratha Cyndusk]] kept a collection of over 4,000 ''speaking gems'' in a fortress hidden within [[Claw Peak]]. She traded those to other [[dragon]]s, including [[Aeglyl Dreadclaw]], in exchange for them sparing the life of [[Vangerdahast]], the [[Royal Mage]] of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Reputation": "By the 14{{th}} century, even Vangerdahast had no idea what those were, but they were greatly appreciated by dragons.",
