        "Powers": "These exotic blades possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and scorched their targets with magical fire. Additionally, ''Cutting Stars'' had a chance of blinding the opponents upon successful strike for eighteen seconds.",
        "History": "Much information on the origins of these magic blades remained a mystery with them occasionally being brought by adventurers from beyond civilization. Oftentimes these travelers told stories of ancient ruined temples and cults that worshiped sun or stars. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several of ''Cutting Stars'' could be found along the [[Sword Coast]], and one in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]], [[Moonsea]]."
