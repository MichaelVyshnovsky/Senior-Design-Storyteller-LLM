'''''Tempest's Touch''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[bow]] that shot seemingly unlimited supply of ''[[lightning arrow (item)|lightning arrow]]s''.

==Powers==
These magic bows possessed ''+2'' enchantments that aided the shooter's aim and helped the missiles reach the targets. ''Tempest's Touch'' did not need ammo as it manifested magic arrows imbued with the power of lightning. Additionally, the wielder received protection from electricity while holding the weapon.

==History==
Some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a tribe of reclusive [[wood elves]] inhabited a small unnamed island on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. They were responsible for creating numerous ''Tempest's Touch'' bows. Sages said the elves learned to harness the fiercest storms that passed the sea into these weapons through strange rituals. However, the wood elves were forced to abandon their island home after several years of abnormally calm weather. It was theorized that [[Thay]]an [[wizard]]s were responsible for the weather manipulation, protecting the Red Wizards' merchant vessels.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one of the ''Tempest's Touch'' bows was sold by one of the exotic weapon dealers in [[Westgate]]'s [[Market Triangle]].
