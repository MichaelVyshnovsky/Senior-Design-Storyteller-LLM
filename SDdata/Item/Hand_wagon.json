        "Some say my [[furnace wagon]] is too dangerous, but I only heard of one person who burned to death. So, if you don't have an [[ox]] or [[ass]] and fear of death by fire but still want a wagon, I have a hand wagon.\n|''Nadul DaRoni, inventor''\n}}": "=Description==",
        "mainbody": "e wagon was a manually-operated wheeled conveyance vaguely similar in form to a [[gondroller]]. The rider sat atop it and pulled down on a pair of handles connected to the axle via a [[pulley]] and line, using their upper-body strength and weight to propel the wagon along.\n\nThe hand wagon was exhausting to operate for more than a few minutes, with few having the strength and stamina to continually pull the handles. It was slowed considerably by any extra weight (such as cargo or passengers) and had to be pushed across bumpy ground or up inclines of more than 5 degrees.\n\nDespite the faults, there was no risk of immolation while operating it, unlike the furnace wagon.",
