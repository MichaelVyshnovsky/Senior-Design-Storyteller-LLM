        "mainbody": "Rings of shocking grasp were enchanted rings of various designs that allowed the wearers to electrocute target with mere touch.\nRings of shocking grasp were often ordinary in appearance but emitted a weak magical aura.\nEven if the aura was weak and hard to detect, the actual enchantment was quite potent. It granted the wearer the ability to deal lightning damage to a target, similarly to the effects of shocking grasp. The wearer had to successfully touch the target with the hand that wore this enchanted ring, in order to shock the opponent. Most rings of shocking grasp held three charges and after exhausting them, went inert for ten minutes.\nWhen the ring was active and worn, it created a round electrified extrusion on the users palm.\nIn 1281 DR, a rings of shocking grasp that belonged to Jasper Silverblood found its way into the shop inventory of Orrick the Grey from Kuldahar. His ring was a thick band of steel with a quartz stone impeded in it.\nRings of shocking grasp could be found in the vicinity of Freedale, in Shadowdale circa mid-14 century DR.\n*Morgunn Lathkule one of the noble family youths from Waterdeep who routinely delved into Undermountain circa 1368 DR.\n*Nestor Podgin the proprietor of Monsters Made to Order in Skullport.\n*Qumasha al-Arus an flame mage from Krak al-Niraan in 1367 DR.\n*Shar-Kee the chieftain of the Lostafinga Tribe of hobgoblins outside of Waterdeep in the mid-14 century DR."
