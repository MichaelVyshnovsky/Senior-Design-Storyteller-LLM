The so-called Hearthfire cheese, or simply Korontaun cheese, was a variety of cheese made with the milk of korontaun, or mountain korrun sheep native to the Giantspire, Icerim, and Sunrise Mountains, notably domesticated by the Nar humans.
Hearthfire was a sharply-flavored cheese with a crumbly texture and a light amber color. It was often smoked alongside slabs of korontaun meat.
By the 15 century DR, Korontaun cheese was produced everywhere these sheep were domesticated Narfell, Rashemen, Thesk, and in recent years, the Great Dale and Murgh√¥m. The smoked variety of that cheese reached Impiltur in the late 15 century DR and quickly became a table staple in the areas where korontaun sheep were present.
