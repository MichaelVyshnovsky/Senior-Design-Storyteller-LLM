        "mainbody": "'''''Heartseeker''''' was a [[spear]] enchanted with the [[hishna]] [[spell]] ''[[create talisman]]''.",
        "Description": "''Heartseeker'' was a heavy spear that more resembled a [[footman's lance]]. The head of the spear was hardened [[obsidian]] that was layered with hishna magic.",
        "Powers": "The hishna magic protected the obsidian head from shattering as that material was prone to do. The other enchantments on the weapon made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm their targets. True to its name, ''heartseeker'' was particularly adept at piercing a target's heart for an instant kill."
