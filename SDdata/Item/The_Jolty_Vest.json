        "mainbody": "'''''The Jolty Vest''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[medium armor]] created by the inventor called [[Yrre the Sparkstruck]] sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''The Jolty Vest'' was a sturdy set of [[chainmail]] armor made out of an especially tough material that slightly reduced slashing damage received. The armor also could discharge accumulated charges of magical lighting onto the attacker. However, there was a chance the lightning discharge would hurt the wearer as well as the attacker.",
        "History": "The magic armor was a creation of Yrre the Sparkstruck, an inventor obsessed with lightning and electively. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Jolty Vest'' fell into the hands of the [[Black Network]] and was among the possessions of [[Brem]], the Zhentish smuggler and merchant who operated out of a cave hideout underneath [[Waukeen's Rest]]."
