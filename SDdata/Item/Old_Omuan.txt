'''Old Omuan''' was a script developed and used by the people of [[Omu]] in [[Chult]].

==Description==
The script used jagged [[Wikipedia:Cuneiform|cuneiform]] characters that bore little resemblance to any other known alphabet. Even Omu's neighbors and rivals on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] could not read it.

==History==
{{fq
| text   = Queen [[Napaka]] proclaims that the free people of Omu fear nothing. Brave [[Nine Trickster Gods|new gods]] protect us, as [[Ubtao]] did before but does no longer. Omu will rise again, and Napaka shall reclaim all that is hers by right of conquest.
| source = A decree by the last monarch of Omu, written in both Old Omuan and [[Common]]

Old Omuan was used by the people of Omu from ancient times until the destruction of their city in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

Formal proclamations were etched in concentric rings onto circular stone tablets, and would need to be written in both Old Omuan and an additional language when Omu's rivals were intended to understand the message, as was the case for a declaration to the [[Mezro]]ans by the city's last ruler&mdash;Queen [[Napaka]]&mdash;that Omu remained strong.

Inscriptions written in Old Omuan adorned sites like [[Nangalore]], and the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]].

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, few except trained scholars or sages could decode Old Omuan inscriptions without the help of an already translated text for reference. As such, spells like ''[[comprehend languages]]'' were otherwise necessary to read it.
