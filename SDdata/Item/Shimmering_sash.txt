Shimmering sashes were magical items that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. They were only used by holy slayers.
These sashes were brightly colored and were layered with embroidery depicting protective texts and wards.
Three times per day the wearer of this sash could alter his or her image just like a blur spell. When using this power the wearer appeared to shimmer like heated desert air.
