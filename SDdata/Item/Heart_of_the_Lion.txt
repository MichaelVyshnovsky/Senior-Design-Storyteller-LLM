The '''Heart of the Lion''' was a holy relic that could be found in the fortress of [[Sarahin]] in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|27}}

==Description==
The Heart of the Lion was actually a [[carnelian]] of bright red coloration. The stone was large, measuring at least a foot across.

==History==
Casting ''[[detect magic]]'' upon the stone would cause it to radiate strong necromantic magic. This occurred because [[Akim al-Kalaas]] used the stone as the receptacle for his ''[[lifeproof]]'' spell. Akim tasked his personal [[dao]] servant to kill anyone who lifted a finger against the stone.

Three smaller fragments sat beside the Heart of the Lion on the sacred altar of the [[Lion's Shrine]]. If held by devout followers of [[Hajama]], these fragments granted them the ability to use ''[[bless]]'', ''[[cloak of bravery]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[dispel evil]]'', and ''[[heal]]''.

==Rumors and Legends==
The founder of the [[Everlasting]] was said to have ripped the Heart from the body of the [[Lion of Suja]].
