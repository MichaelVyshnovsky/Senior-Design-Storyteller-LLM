'''''Termite shot''''' was a specific variety of [[mage shot]] that, when it collided upon impact, released a brown viscous syrup that was particularly damaging to wood. After the syrupy substance was exposed it would bubble over and immediately weaken and dissolve any wood with which it made contact. This damage could not be magically stopped except by the [[spell]] ''[[dispel magic]]''.{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}

In the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], certain [[mage]]s attempted to develop a substance similar to ''termite shot'' that would work on the stone and ceramic [[spelljammer]]s of the [[illithid]]s and [[neogi]]. It was rumored that the blood of both [[umber hulk]]s and [[purple worm]]s were used in its development.
