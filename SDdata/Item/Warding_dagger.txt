A '''''warding dagger''''' was an [[enchanted]] item that protected its user.

==Description==
They shed a bright but brief stormy blue radiance when exposed, and this light dripped off of them.

==Powers==
Such daggers were driven to their hilts into the ground in two concentric circles at regular intervals, with the outer ring upright and the inner angled so that their blades touched beneath the earth. The user uttered words sounding similar to a bawdy dance song, and finally said a single quiet work as they held their hand palm downward and fingers splayed over them. These daggers unleashed some manner of electrical attack at trespassers.

==History==
[[Elminster Aumar]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], employed such daggers to protect himself during his quest in the {{yearlinkName|761}}, when he was forbidden from casting [[spell]]s whenever he could help it. He stuck them in the ground around himself as preparation before going to sleep outdoors and they struck against the strange creatures led by [[Silent Antlers]] when they tried to assault him in his sleep.
