Incense of obsession was a magical variety of incense.
Incense of obsession was said to be indistinguishable from incense of meditation.
Those who attempted to pray or meditate while in the vicinity of a lit incense of obsession would be struck with an overwhelming sense of confidence in regards to their spellcasting capability. They would become self-assured that their prowess in magic surpassed all others. Beyond that, they would feel an inescapable urge to cast spells at every opportunity, even if doing so would be unnecessary or futile. This entrancement would linger until 24 hours had passed or the affected being had cast every spell in their arsenal.
The moralist Shahpesh was known to possess an incense of obsession.
