        "Description": "''Hazirawn'' was a dark-colored blade of Netherese design. It sported a curling guard and a pommel embedded with a purple [[gem]].",
        "Powers": "As an intelligent item, ''Hazirawn'' had a personality and moral alignment of its own. It could even converse in both the [[Common]] and [[Netherese language]]s. Once a wielder took up ''Hazirawn'', it functioned as a ''+1 greatsword'' when used in combat and further infused the weapon's attacks with [[necrotic]] energy.\n\nAdditionally, if the wielder of ''Hazirawn'' managed to successfully attune themselves with the weapon, then its powers doubled in potency and the blade revealed its deeper abilities. Firstly, an attuned wielder could manifest the spells: ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', and ''[[detect thoughts]]''. These spells renewed each night at midnight. Secondly, when attuned to a wielder, ''Hazirawn'' became an even deadlier weapon and gained the ''[[wounding]]'' property.",
        "History": "One of the few scions of the [[Netherese]] [[House Orogoth]], [[Rezmir]] had come into possession of ''Hazirawn'' by [[1489 DR]].{{cite web| url = http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/story/villains/rezmir| title = Rezmir: Black Dragon Whisperer| accessdate = | accessmonthday = Oct 26| accessyear     = 2016| author         = | last           = | first          = | authorlink     = | coauthors      = | date           = | year           = | month          = | format         = HTML| work           = Villans| publisher      = [[WotC]]| pages          = | language       = | archiveurl     = | archivedate    = | quote          = }} She wielded it throughout the [[Tyranny of Dragons]] when the [[Cult of the Dragon]] sought to bring [[Tiamat]] to [[Faerûn]]. \n\nThe Sword Hazirawn was forged during the height of the Netherese empire. Once a successful military commander for the Netherese empire, Lord-General Hazirawn led numerous skirmishes and rarely suffered a loss. Over a long military career spanning several centuries (thanks to the spells of the Council), he was responsible for many significant protective actions. He was summarily selected for “the process,” and upon reporting to the \"Laboratory\" (a Netherese black site) he was pressed into the greatsword; the process for which is detailed in the ''Principae Antiquus'' spellbook. The “Findings” section indicated that Hazirawn felt a great sense of betrayal but his value needed to be preserved, and it is only due to the incorporation of the Writhing Battery that he could be an eternal instrument of the Empire.
