'''''Net of entrapment''''' was an enchanted net of magical strength that obeyed the owner's commands.

==Description==
''Net of entrapment'' appeared to be a simple net weaved of [[rope]]. A typical net bundle of a ''net of entrapment'' was a {{SI|10|ft}} square, with {{SI|3|in|c}} sized squares in its mesh.

==Powers==
''Nets of entrapment'' were enchanted to withstand even the strongest creatures, making it significantly harder for others to rip or cut through the net. With the use of a command word, a net could be suspended in the air and dropped on its targets. Similarly, a net could be spread on the floor and ensnare targets, closing upwards, with another command word. The net could be loosened with a command word as well.

==History==
In [[1340 DR]], ''nets of entrapment'' were carried by some of the [[Zhentarim]] agents that populated the Zhentarim outpost in the vicinity of [[Phlan]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Uthegentel Del'Armgo]]: the weapon master of [[Barrison Del'Armgo]] possessed a ''net of entrapment'' until his death in [[1358 DR]].
*[[Yvonnel Baenre]]: a well-equipped Matron Mother of [[House Baenre]] owned one of these nets until her death in 1358 DR.
