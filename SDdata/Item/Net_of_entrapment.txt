Net of entrapment was an enchanted net of magical strength that obeyed the owners commands.
Net of entrapment appeared to be a simple net weaved of rope. A typical net bundle of a net of entrapment was a  square, with  sized squares in its mesh.
Nets of entrapment were enchanted to withstand even the strongest creatures, making it significantly harder for others to rip or cut through the net. With the use of a command word, a net could be suspended in the air and dropped on its targets. Similarly, a net could be spread on the floor and ensnare targets, closing upwards, with another command word. The net could be loosened with a command word as well.
In 1340 DR, nets of entrapment were carried by some of the Zhentarim agents that populated the Zhentarim outpost in the vicinity of Phlan.

*Yvonnel Baenre a well-equipped Matron Mother of House Baenre owned one of these nets until her death in 1358 DR.
