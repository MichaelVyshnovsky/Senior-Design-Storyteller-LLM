The '''''sitting monkey''''' was a magical chalice carved in the shape of a [[monkey]]. It was one of the ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'', a collection of magical vessels created by the [[Han people]] of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.

==Powers==
To use the ''sitting monkey'', one had to hold a ceremony at midnight, in which they burned incense inside the cup and made a certain, strange chant. In return, they received greater skill in climbing, an overall boost to abilities that depended on experience, and the power to use the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell like a [[shukenja]] one time a day.

A user had to perform this ceremony nightly in order to retain these powers. However, if they continued this regimen for six months or more, they suffered a permanent change: their toes became as prehensile as a monkey's, able to naturally grasp things like branches, ledges, and [[rope]]s. This made it uncomfortable to wear shoes.

==History==
As one of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', the ''sitting bull''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. However, it was later lost.

In the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], King [[Wanang Sun]] led an expedition to recover three of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung''. He was successful, discovering the ''[[sitting bull]]'', ''sitting monkey'', and ''[[standing deer]]'' by [[1357 DR]]. He kept the ''sitting monkey'' stored in his treasure rooms.
