A '''''pendant of invisibility''''' was a [[magic item]] that rendered the wearer invisible.{{Cite dungeon/112/Appendix 2: New Items|91}}

==Description==
It usually took the form of a [[diamond]] suspended on a [[silver]] chain so it could be worn as an [[amulet]].

==Powers==
The wearer could use the pendant to turn themselves invisible, as per the spell ''[[invisibility]]''. This worked thrice a dayThe duration of the ''invisibility'' effect is not stated in ''Dungeon'' #112. The equivalent duration of the spell in 3.5-edition rules is assumed here.

==Creation==
Creating one required skill in [[Item enchantment|crafting wonderous items]] and the spell ''invisibility''.

==Availability==
A ''pendant of invisibility'' was valued at 7,200 [[gold pieces]].

==History==
One day in the early 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] made a smash-and-grab robbery of a store selling [[gem]]s and [[jewelry]]. Holga gifted one piece, a jeweled pendant, to Edgin's four-year-old daughter [[Kira]], who, to their surprise, promptly disappeared simply by touching it. Fortunately, she soon reappeared with what they realized what was a ''pendant of invisibility''. She would later use the ''pendant of invisibility'' to aid them in their heists{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} and to sneak around [[Castle Never]] in [[Neverwinter]]<ref> and finally to help Edgin, Holga, [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Doric]] defeat the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Sofina]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Kira]], daughter of Edgin Darvis
