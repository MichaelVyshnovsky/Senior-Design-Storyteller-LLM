'''''Maces of smiting''''', also known as '''''rods of smiting''''', were magical [[mace]]s or [[rod]]s that could demolish [[golem]]s and [[outsider]]s. The '''''rod of smiting II''''' could be found in [[Zakhara]], the [[Land of Fate]]. 

==Powers==
The original ''rod of smiting'' was a ''+3'' weapon. It dealt twice the usual damage against golems and had chance of even destroying them outright, but every blow against a golem drained it of one charge. It dealt the expected damage against beings of the [[Outer Plane]]s, but had a chance of inflicting thrice the usual damage, at the cost of a charge. The ''rod of smiting'' could not be recharged.

The ''rod of smiting II'' had all of the powers of its non-Zakharan counterpart, but also had a greater chance to completely destroy [[copper automaton]]s and [[living idol]]s.

The ''rods of smiting'' wielded by monadic devas had all the same powers and dealt greater damage to foes armored in metal and creatures made of stone or other solid materials. It functioned only for its owner and never ran out of charges.

The later ''mace of smiting'' was a ''+3 [[adamantine]] [[heavy mace]]'' had a greater magical enhancement against all [[construct]]s, and had a chance of destroying them completely. A critical blow against an [[outsider]] could inflict twice as much injury as normal.

==Creation==
Forging such a weapon required a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell.

==Notable Owners==

* [[Monadic deva]]s commonly wielded sturdy metal rods empowered as ''rods of smiting'', They most likely vanished with them when they died.
* [[Reizzlerum Caskview]] owned a ''mace of smiting'' that her [[ghost]] maintained a connection with. Its head resembled an angry [[dwarf|dwarven]] face and caused those who owned it to have an unending thirst for [[ale]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Into the Dark|9,21}}
* The [[archdevil]] [[Bele]], justiciar of [[Cania]], wielded a black rod of office, which was equivalent in effect to a ''rod of smiting''.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|29}}
