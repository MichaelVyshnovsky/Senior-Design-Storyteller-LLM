        "mainbody": "hite wands were special magic items given by Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain, to followers who caused widespread pain and suffering.\nEach individual who received a white wand experienced a mental communication as to their intended purpose. A white wand would melt into nothing if it was touched by someone other than the intended recipient. A white wand automatically absorbed the power from spells cast at its carrier, dissolving into nothing when its magic was spent.\nLoviatar usually granted a white wand to a member of her clergy, but occasionally she would gift one to individuals who caused a great deal of suffering, willingly or not, even if they did not worship her. Loviatar actually preferred to gift white wands to good-natured people who unknowingly caused immense suffering because of their actions, enjoying the strife and turmoil they would feel realizing they had spread her cause. Under this circumstance a white wand would actually emit a wicked laugh every time it was used."
