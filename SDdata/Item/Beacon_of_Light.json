        "mainbody": "The '''Beacon of Light''' was an ancient [[Mulhorandi]] [[artifact]] tied to the god-kings of Mulhorand.",
        "Description": "The Beacon was a [[golden]] cube adorned with [[silver]] cylinders that extended from all four corners on the top of the cube.",
        "Powers": "The Beacon was capable of shining through the thickest fog and rain at sea, shining light for miles and providing a clear signal for ships. A [[command word]] was used to activate and deactivate the Beacon. It could only be used for a maximum of six hours per day. All of this information could be learned by using a ''[[legend lore]]'' [[spell]].\n\nThis item was sacred to the temple of [[Anhur]]. A hidden feature of the ''Beacon of Light'' was that it would act like a homing beacon for agents of the temple of Anhur who were eager to retrieve the lost artifact. Any [[adventurer]] who discovered the Beacon without returning it to the temple in [[Skuld]] would find themselves pursued by [[Chessentan]] mercenaries and perhaps even the [[Statues That Walk]].",
        "History": "The Beacon was buried beneath the sand inside of a lone lighthouse found on the isle of [[Sarr]] in the [[Pirate Isles]] in [[1359 DR]]."
