        "mainbody": "he Beacon of Light was an ancient Mulhorandi artifact tied to the god-kings of Mulhorand. \nThe Beacon was a golden cube adorned with silver cylinders that extended from all four corners on the top of the cube.\nThe Beacon was capable of shining through the thickest fog and rain at sea, shining light for miles and providing a clear signal for ships. A command word was used to activate and deactivate the Beacon. It could only be used for a maximum of six hours per day. All of this information could be learned by using a legend lore spell.\nThis item was sacred to the temple of Anhur. A hidden feature of the Beacon of Light was that it would act like a homing beacon for agents of the temple of Anhur who were eager to retrieve the lost artifact. Any adventurer who discovered the Beacon without returning it to the temple in Skuld would find themselves pursued by Chessentan mercenaries and perhaps even the Statues That Walk.\nThe Beacon was buried beneath the sand inside of a lone lighthouse found on the isle of Sarr in the Pirate Isles in 1359 DR."
