'''''Lamia's Tongue''''' was one-of-a-kind [[enchanted]] [[throwing dagger]] wielded by The Black Lamia, also known as [[Suhailah el Khaba]] of [[Calimshan]], some years before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Lamia's Tongue'' was made using dull black [[steel]] and was engraved with an image of a barbed tongue. Its handle was crafted to have a texture of fine scales.

==Powers==
When it hit a target, ''Lamia's Tongue'' embedded itself in the victim and, momentarily after, it flew back to the owner's hand. Despite being an engraving, the barbs were magical and ripped the target open when the ''Lamia's Tongue'' darted away.

==History==
''Lamia's Tongue'' once belonged to Suhailah el Khaba, a renowned sell-sword of [[Calimport]] who was active some years before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. In her hands, the ''Tongue'' ended the lives of many opponents long before they could reach Suhailah, and she always aimed at their throats. Eventually, the sell-sword's career ended mysteriously. Some said she was locked away in the depths of the earth after murdering a vengeful [[mage]]'s niece, while others repeated a more romantic story of how Suhailah fell in love with a noble from the land of the [[Red Wizards]], [[Thay]], and later was forced into hiding. Even though her final fate remained unrecorded, Suhailah el Khaba was gone, leaving behind numerous items of the trade behind. All ended up scattered across [[Faerûn]].

By 1312 DR, ''Lamia's Tongue'' ended up in the nest of a duo of [[white dragon]]s who laired in the [[River Caves]] in the [[Cold Marshes]] of the [[Ice Lakes]], where the [[Black Raven River]] spilled out from under the [[Spine of the World]]. The dragons stood in the way of a group of mercenaries from [[Targos]] who sought passage to the town of [[Kuldahar]].
