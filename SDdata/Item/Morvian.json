        "mainbody": "'''''Morvian''''' was a magical [[greatsword]] and one of the ''[[baneblades of Demron]]'' created in [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "It was a magnificent [[greatsword]] designed for folk of [[human]], [[elf]], or [[dwarf]] size, weighing 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms). It gave off a strong yellow light when drawn, resembling sunlight.",
        "Uses": "As one of ''baneblades'', it was a ''+4 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]]'' weapon that was a ''[[bane (property)|bane]]'' to both [[undead]] and [[evil]] [[outsider]]s. ''Morvian'' was also ''[[axiomatic]]'' and let its wielder use ''[[daylight]]'' once a day. In contrast to earlier ''baneblades'', it could be used by members of any race, provided they were [[lawful good]]; it was just a non-magical if well-made sword for anyone else.",
        "History": "It was crafted by the archmage [[Demron]] before the fall of Myth Drannor, and was the third of his series of Baneblades. \n\nSometime before the fall of Myth Drannor, ''Morvian'' was stolen by a [[demon]] [[Rivener]]. In attempting to retrieve the ''Baneblade'', a group of [[gold dragon]]s failed to defeat the creature, instead sealing him under the [[Castle Cormanthor]].\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]], guided by the [[ghost]] of [[Hachaam Selorn]], defeated the powerful demon and retrieved the ''Baneblade Morvian'' to aid them in defeating the [[Cult of Dragon]] occupying the ruins of Myth Drannor."
