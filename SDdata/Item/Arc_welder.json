        "Powers": "Depending on if it was a short- or long-range variant, arc welders could either discharge a wide field or a single long beam of electricity, with the power building up over time. In addition, in the hands of an artificer the device passively increased the potency of their electricity-based [[spell]]s and made their other weapons more deadly, including electrifying them. It also made it easier to stun, trip, and pierce the armor of an opponent.",
        "History": "Prototype arc welders were found in and around the mines of Tethyamar in the {{yearlinkName|1487}}, during [[Hal Stoutheart]]'s expedition to the mines of Tethyamar. A long-range welder could be found in [[Mineshaft 214S]] with the mad dwarf [[Egil Hakon]], while a short-range welder was in the possession of the [[drider]] [[slaver]] [[Phy'xzar]] at a [[drow]] camp.{{DDO-MoTtime}}"
