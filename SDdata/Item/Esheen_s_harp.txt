'''''Esheen's harp''''' was a magical [[harp]] used by the [[Harpers]].

==Powers==
When played, ''Esheen's harp'' caused glass and metal objects within a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} radius of its strings to vibrate and resonate, creating an eerie and noticeable effect. If the harpist plucked the lowest string, any glass or metal objects up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} away from the end of the harp's body could shatter instantly into tiny fragments. The harp affected all items within the {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}}-wide path of effect, leaving no option to spare some objects while targeting others.

==History==
''Esheen's harp'' originated from the ancient city of [[Myth Drannor]].
