        "Powers": "The crossbow possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and magically improved the wielder's dexterity.",
        "History": "''Outrider's Flight'' was created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}} by halfling champions known as [[outrider]]s. The elite hin cavalry was celebrated defenders of their kin, and ''Outrider's Flight'' was specifically designed for mounted use. Despite its diminutive appearance, the crossbow packed a wallop. In 1374 DR, ''Outrider's Flight'' found its way to the [[Eyegouger Approach]] and was in the hands of [[orc]]ish archers there until it was liberated by [[Kalach-Cha]] and their companions."
