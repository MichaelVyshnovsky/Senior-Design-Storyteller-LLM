        "Powers": "These orcish belts came with two variations of the enchantmentâ€”regular ''archer's belts'', and more potent ''greater archer's belts''. The belts possessed magics that made the wearer resistant to piercing missiles and weapons.",
        "History": "''Archer's belts'' were commissioned by the King [[Obould]] of the Many-Arrows after his orc archers started getting wounded and losing lives to the archers of [[Citadel Sundbarr]]. Orcish shamans started creating these belts for the most distinguished archers and warriors of the [[Spine of the World]]. The worthiness of the warriors was determined in contests that, with time, became the height of orcish entertainment. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], many of ''archer's belts'' fell into the hands of non-orcs, and were found along the [[Sword Coast]] as well as far-away lands of [[Samarach]]. One belt could be fun in the [[Tempest's Fury]], a magical conclave of researchers, slaughtered by a rogue [[djinni]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.",
