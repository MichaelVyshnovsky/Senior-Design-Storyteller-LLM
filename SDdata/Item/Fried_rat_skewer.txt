Fried rat skewer was a common dish found among the poor folk of Baldurs Gate and the Western Heartlands, along the Chionthar Valley in the late 15 century DR.
These delectable and succulent skewers were made with a single rat on a stick, or as many as three. The animals were skinned and fried until crispy, seasoned generously with garlic, lime, and peppers. The dish was surprisingly tasty, as long as the consumer did not think about what type of meat they were eating.
As of the late 15 century DR, fried and seasoned rat skewer could be found in the Rivington district of Baldurs Gate, cooked by the refugees who flooded the city in the wake of the Cult of the Absolutes invasion, as well as in the Moonrise Towers, cooked by the Absolutist goblins.
