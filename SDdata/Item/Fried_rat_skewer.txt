'''Fried rat skewer''' was a common dish found among the poor folk of [[Baldur's Gate]] and the [[Western Heartlands]], along the [[Chionthar Valley]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
These delectable and succulent [[skewer]]s were made with a single [[rat]] on a stick, or as many as three. The animals were skinned and fried until crispy, seasoned generously with [[garlic]], [[lime]], and [[pepper]]s. The dish was surprisingly tasty, as long as the consumer did not think about what type of meat they were eating.

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, fried and seasoned rat skewer could be found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district of Baldur's Gate, cooked by the refugees who flooded the city in the wake of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s invasion, as well as in the [[Moonrise Towers]], cooked by the Absolutist [[goblin]]s.
