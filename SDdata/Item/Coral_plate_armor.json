        "mainbody": "'''''Coral plate armor''''' were sets of [[heavy armor]] ensorcelled with minor [[enchantment]]s of [[sahuagin]] creation.",
        "Description": "These sets of aquatic [[coral]] plate mail were similar in construction to [[splint mail]] worn by the inhabitants of the land and were used almost exclusively by [[sahuagin]]. The armor's base was tight [[sharkskin]] leather with tough coral plates affixed to protect shoulders, chest, and wrist areas. Its aquatic nature and design made it uncomfortable and restrictive when worn by races other than sahuagin.",
        "Powers": "''Coral plate armor'' possessed enchantments that provided good protection from fire and [[acid]]. It also was more effective at stopping piercing weapons than slashing.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, sahuagin that dwelt within an ancient temple on the [[Isle of the Great Wyrm]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] were armored with these sets of coral plates."
