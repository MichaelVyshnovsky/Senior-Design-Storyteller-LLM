        "mainbody": "'''Fish oil''' was the natural [[oil]]s extracted from the bodies of various fatty fish. It was used in alchemy, ship-building, tool crafting, and as a [[spell]] [[Material component|component]].\n{{quote|''We deal with magical crises, threats to the very existence of the Realms, wild creeping horrors that seek to devour all Waterdeepâ€”that sort of thing. We do not fetch down [[cat]]s from balconies where they've fled because their owners wanted to bathe them in fish oil. Fish oil is best used for romancing mermaids.''|[[Maerlus]] the Magnificent}}",
        "Description": "Fish oil was a clear yellow, greasy, pungent, liquid oil.",
        "Availability": "One noteworthy producer of these oils was [[Tethyr]]. The [[Guild of Fishmongers and Fishermen]] had warehouses on the eastern docks of [[Tulmene]] that were filled with fish oil and could be smelled from afar. The town of [[Port Kir]], like many other port cities in Tethyr, produced fresh and [[salted fish|salted]] [[fish]], as well as fish oil.",
        "Uses": "In [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]], wooden [[skiff]]s were treated with fish oil or tar to seal hull imperfections during the building process. In a similar manner, a bright red mix of fish oil and certain local roots was used to treat ships' oar sockets on the isle of [[Oman]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n\nIn alchemy, fish oil was one of the ingredients in brewing ''[[potion of power|potions of power]]'', ''[[potion of defense|potions of defense]]'', ''[[potion of deflect|potions of deflection]]'', ''[[potion of critical strike|potions of critical strike ]]'', ''[[flask of potency|flasks of potency]]'', and especially potent versions of ''[[potion of fortification]]'', ''[[potion of accuracy]]'', ''[[potion of force]]'', ''[[potion of reflexes]]'', and ''[[tidespan potion]]''.\n\nIn blacksmithing, fish oil was used to treat forged items like [[dagger|knives]], [[scythe]]s, [[axe|hatchet]]s, [[hammer]]s, and swordbreaker [[sword]]s.\n\n[[Sahuagin]] priestesses of the shark god [[Sekolah]] used fish blubber, fish oil, and certain sea chemicals to make incendiary weapons called ''[[Sekolah's fire]]'', mixed with air, and packed into tubes. The recipe for this dangerous jelly was a secret only known to the High Priestesses of Sekolah.{{Cite dragon/239/Sneaky Sea Devils|11}}\n\n[[Maerlus|Maerlus the Magnificent]] of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] claimed that fish oil was useful for romancing [[mermaid]]s.{{Cite dragon/425/Spin a Yarn: The Night Thelva Clovenaxe Flew|43}}"
