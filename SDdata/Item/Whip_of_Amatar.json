        "mainbody": "A whip of Amatar was a rare variety of long whip designed by the dwarven smith of the same name.\nWhips of Amatar were noted to resemble large centipedes with ringlike segments. They could be found constructed from a variety of metals, though the most commonly used material was adamantine.\nBy uttering a secret command word, a whips wielder would activate an effect equivalent to the spell, stone to flesh, affecting any creature or natural stone struck by it. Though a small number of these whips were known to instead possess an effect equivalent to the spells counterpart, flesh to stone. Whichever effect a whip of Amatar possessed, it could only be activated three times per day."
