Occasionally, muffins were used to smuggle secret messages or items hidden within.\nMuffins were served with tea at the Royal Arms inn in Luskan and were commonly served as a morningfeast food in Westgate on the Dragon Coast and in Mulmaster on the Moonsea.\nIn Tegals Mark in the Dalelands, The Markhouse inn offered its guest complimentary muffins, biscuits, and chilled berry juice.
