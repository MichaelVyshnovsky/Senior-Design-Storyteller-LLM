A nightblade was a enchanted +1 dagger crafted by the Red Wizards of Thay for use by their agents and spies.
These blades were much more effective when wielded against good-aligned people and creatures. When it struck, it damaged the core of who they were as a person, potentially draining their strength, intellect, fortitude or other similar attributes.
