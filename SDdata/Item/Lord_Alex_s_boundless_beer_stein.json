By [[1372 DR]], ''Lord Alex's boundless beer stein'' could be found in one of the piles of \"antiques\" within the [[Torleth's Treasures]] store of [[Gillian's Hill]]. The metal mug appeared mundane, and its magic remained unidentified, mixed with other junk, sold for a mere one hundred [[gold]] pieces."
