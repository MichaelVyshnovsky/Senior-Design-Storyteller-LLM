A '''trident''' was a three-pronged martial piercing weapon.

==Description==
Tridents were long poles, generally measuring {{SIrange|4|8|ft|long = yes}} in length, with a three-pronged fork on the end.

==Weaponology==
Tridents were typically used for fishing, though occasionally people used them for hunting or in place of a ''pitchfork''. A trident could be thrown, but it was not as well-balanced as a spear. It also was effective in defending against charges.

==Varieties==
* '''Luqu:''' a type of trident that was used by the [[Iulutiun]]s primarily for spearing fish. They were made of lashed segments of bone or wood, with each prong covered in hooked barbs. They typically measured {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} or longer and {{SI|1|in}} in diameter.
