        "mainbody": "greater vestment of power was a magic item that provided a number of useful magical abilities to the wearer.\nThese items usually appeared in the form of a set of robes.\nIn addition to the powers provided by a set of a lesser vestment of power, the greater vestment granted a pair of powers that could each be used up to three times per day. These were true seeing and dimension door.\nEach set of greater vestments of power had its own command word. Uttering the command word when touching the robes but not wearing them would caused them to become invisible and levitate in place. The vestment could remain in this state for centuries unless made to reappear again. To make the vestment reappear the command word needed to be spoken backwards while within  of the vestment.\nSiamorphe, the Divine Right, wore some robes that were imbued with the magic of a greater vestment of power."
