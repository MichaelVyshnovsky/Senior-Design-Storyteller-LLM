        "mainbody": "iteabate was an ointment that soothed bumps and bruises received from rough treatment.\nBiteabate was an off-white gel made by the sorceress and alchemist Angrath Dree from herbs and saps found in northwest Faer√ªn. It could be purchased from her at Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch, or possibly from secondary vendors elsewhere. The usual price for a jar of ointment was 20 gp.\nEach application of biteabate healed minor injuries such as those incurred during a fist fight, similar to a cure light wounds for more life-threatening wounds. It also relieved pain and reduced headache resulting from such a pummeling."
