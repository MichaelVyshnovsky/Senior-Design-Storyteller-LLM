        "mainbody": "An '''''amber amulet of vermin''''' was a magic item that conjured a giant insect to serve its owner.",
        "Description": "The amulet consisted of an irregular nugget of natural [[amber]] on a [[gold]] chain, with an insect caught inside the amber. If watched closely, it appeared to slightly twitch.",
        "Powers": "In the initial version of the amulet, when the amber was broken, the insect trapped inside burst out, sprang to life, and grew larger as though the spell ''[[giant vermin]]'' had been cast upon it. A later version could be reused once a day, with the insect being summoned and vanishing after one minute.\n\nThis creature could be either a [[giant bee]], [[Giant mantis|giant praying mantis]], [[Ant#Giant|giant queen ant]], [[Stag beetle#Giant|giant stag beetle]], [[giant wasp]], [[Monstrous centipede|huge monstrous centipede]], large [[monstrous scorpion]] or [[Spider#Large monstrous|large monstrous spider]].",
        "Cost": "Depending on the type of creature, the amulet could be worth between 500 and 1200 [[gold piece]]s.",
