However, Dekirh Fasthands wore it to stage and painted it in a bright jester fashion in reds, blues, and golds.\nIn addition to its potent +4 defensive enchantment, Jesters Chain also offered the wearer increased resistance to slashing and crushing damage.\nJesters Chain was a gift to Dekirh Fasthands from his friends who were worried for the jesters well-being as he insisted on performing in some of the rowdiest taverns across the Sword Coast some time before the mid-14 century DR. The armor was to protect the bard from things that often was thrown at him during the performances rotten produce and knives.\n* Hue Greenleaf, a merchant in Red Wizard Dennatons gladiatorial arena in Thay in the late 14 century DR."
