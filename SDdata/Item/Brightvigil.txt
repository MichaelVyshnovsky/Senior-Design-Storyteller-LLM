Brightvigil was a potion that protected against sleep-inducing magical effects.
Brightvigil was a light, clear liquid made by the sorceress and alchemist Angrath Dree from herbs and saps found in northwest Faer√ªn. It could be purchased from her at Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch, or possibly from secondary vendors elsewhere. The usual price for a single dose was 30 gp.
The effects of brightvigil lasted one hour. During that hour the imbiber was much less likely to be affected by sleep spells and similar magics.
