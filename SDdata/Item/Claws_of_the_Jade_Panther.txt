The '''''Claws of the Jade Panther''''' were [[gloves]] that were used as a deadly weapon by the infamous [[Shou]] monk only known as the [[Jade Panther]].

==Description==
Each glove had three razor-sharp claw-shaped blades attached to them. Specifically designed to be worn by [[monk]]s, these gloves allowed them not only to shower their opponents with bludgeoning fist punches but also slash them open with the gloves' blades.

==History==
Originally owned by the Jade Panther, these gloves were stolen by [[Li Mai]], the Panther's lover. She felt that the Panther became too cruel and ordered one of her servants to destroy the ''Claws''. However, the gloves were sold on a black market instead. Eventually, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Claws'' were exported out of [[Shou Lung]] and were sold at [[Okuzo's Imports]] of [[Westgate]].
