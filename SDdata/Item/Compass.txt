A '''compass''', also called a '''trailfinder''', was an instrument that showed the cardinal directions. It was used for navigation and travel. They were found amongst sets of [[navigator's tools]].

==Function==
Compasses utilized a [[magnet]]ic needle that pointed north–south, but the principle was not well understood in the Realms, so their designs were crude and unscientific. For example, although navigators around [[Zakhara]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]] were familiar with them, it was widely believed the needle was possessed by a [[gen]]. In addition, navigators did not fully understand magnetic declination, that is, the angle of difference between a magnetic pole and a pole star. Hence, their accuracy was passable and their usefulness limited, and made much worse aboard a rocking ship, yet they could still provide a slight benefit to navigation at sea.

Proximity to large [[lodestone]]—that is, magnetic rock—could ruin a compass needle.

==History==
Compasses were invented, at least independently, by [[Shou]] craftsmen of [[Shou Lung]].

==Varieties==
[[File:Trailfinder.jpg|thumb|''A trailfinder of the Utter East.'']]
;[[Compass rose]]: A type of [[magic]]al compass from the land of Zakhara. They took the form of a clear medallion and came with some metal rose that they could track the direction of.
;Elemental Compass: Magical compasses designed to function within the [[Inner Planes]].
;Zakharan Compass: Compasses in the land of Zakhara had thirty-two points of direction, each referred to as a [[Midani_dictionary#K|''khann'']]. Magical versions of these compasses existed that really did have a gen trapped in the needle, though these were incredibly rare and just as expensive. Such magical compasses always pointed to the pole star, not to magnetic north, so they had a significant discrepancy with basic compasses, which could cause confusion. They remained much more accurate and were a greater aid to navigation.

==Usage==
Compasses were used for navigation in such places as the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in [[Faerûn]], the [[Celestial Sea]] in [[Kara-Tur]] and the [[Crowded Sea]] of [[Zakhara]].

Trailfinders were used in the [[Utter East]] during the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]) to aid [[basal golem]] warriors traverse uneven terrain.
