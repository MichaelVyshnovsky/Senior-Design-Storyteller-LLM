'''''Slings of Arvoreen''''' were magic [[sling]]s, thought to be created through a blessing from the [[hin]] deity [[Arvoreen]].

==Powers==
These slings were [[enchanted]] to deal truly mighty blows to their targets. They functioned as weapons possessing a powerful ''+4'' enchantment and granted the wielders magical ''[[freedom of movement]]''.

==History==
The very first of these [[Arvoreenan]] weapons were believed to be gifted to the halfling hero [[Tuckerby Letterworp]] after he emerged victorious from the [[Battle of Moor Road]]. However, that story was contradicted because similar items appeared in virtually all halfling settlements across the Realms. Like the famed ''[[Story of Littleman]]'', the story behind ''slings of Arvoreen'' remained unconfirmed and obscured by boisterous embellishments.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of such magic slings existed, found along the [[Sword Coast]], in the city of [[Neverwinter]], as well as the city of [[Melvaunt]] in the [[Moonsea]] region.
