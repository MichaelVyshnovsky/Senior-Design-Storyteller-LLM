        "mainbody": "nomish firefly lamps were decorative lamps that were popular at parties held by the nobility across Faer√ªn.\nA typical firefly lamp consisted of a basket-shaped container made of a wired mesh that served as a trap to capture fireflies. The glow provided by the fireflies did not provide any useful illumination, but made for a nice eye-catching atmospheric glow in gardens or darkened rooms. Captured fireflies died if not released by the end of the evening.\nGnomish firefly lamps were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nThese lamps became popular among the nobility in several cities, including Arabel, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Suzail, and Waterdeep, in the 1360s DR."
