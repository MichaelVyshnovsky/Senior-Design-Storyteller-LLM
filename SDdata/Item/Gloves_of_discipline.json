        "mainbody": "'''''Gloves of discipline''''' were enchanted gloves used by the [[Silver Ravens]] of [[Sembia]] to train their new recruits.",
        "Powers": "''Gloves of discipline'' could be created with enchantments of three power levelsâ€”normal, greater, and epic. These gloves enhanced the wearer's discipline, allowing them to master fighting skills at a higher pace and made it harder for their opponents to disarm them.",
        "History": "Original pairs of the ''gloves of discipline'' were commissioned by [[Miklos Selkirk]] for his Silver Ravens in Sembia. He was an impatient man and grew tired seeing his recruits being easily disarmed via their sparring partners or simple fumbles. Miklos saw rapid improvement once the recruits, who were outfitted with ''gloves of discipline'', could not be disarmed with ease.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century, ''gloves of discipline'' could be found in the areas surrounding [[Neverwinter]] and the [[Sword Coast]] and were in high demand.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Feldran Exeltis]], a scion of the [[Exeltis]] noble family in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
