Varsh Kokuus boots were a pair of enchanted footwear that belonged to Varsh Kokuu the githyanki youth caretaker from Crèche Yllek in the late 15 century DR.
These leather boots possessed the enchantment that made them completely safe from acid damage, and being water-proof, they kept the acid from leaking through the boots seams. This made the wearers feet safe from any spilled acid and made the rest of their body resistant to its corrosive damage.
Varsh Kokuus boots were in use in the  by Varsh Kokuu, allowing him to move safely across the acidic pools of the Crèche Yllek hatchery.
