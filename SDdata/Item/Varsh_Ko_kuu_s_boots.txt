'''''Varsh Ko'kuu's boots''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] footwear that belonged to [[Varsh Ko'kuu]] the [[githyanki]] youth caretaker from [[Crèche Y'llek]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
These [[leather boot]]s possessed the enchantment that made them completely safe from [[acid]] damage, and being water-proof, they kept the acid from leaking through the [[boots]]' seams. This made the wearer's feet safe from any spilled acid and made the rest of their body resistant to its corrosive damage.

==History==
''Varsh Ko'kuu's boots'' were in use in the {{YearlinkName|1492}} by Varsh Ko'kuu, allowing him to move safely across the acidic pools of the Crèche Y'llek hatchery.
