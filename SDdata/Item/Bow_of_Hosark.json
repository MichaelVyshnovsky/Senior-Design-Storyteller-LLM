        "mainbody": "The Bow of Hosark was a powerful magical longbow associated with unicorns and possibly with the faiths of Mielikki the Forest Queen or Lurue the Unicorn.\nThe bow was carved from a creamy-white wood of unknown origin but almost appearing to be ivory and was quite beautiful to behold. Druids and rangers who looked upon it, and only them, reported seeing a faint carving on the outer curve depicting a unicorns head in outline. For this reason, they believed it to be linked somehow to Mielikki or Lurue.\nThe string glowed faintly with a blue light when the bow was drawn, as its imparted its magic to the arrow.\nThe Bow of Hosark possessed a number of magical powers. It was described as a +2 distance mighty composite longbow that would let even the very strong put their full power into the shot.\nFirst, an arrow shot with it could be made more precisely or more penetrating. The archer chose which before they let it fly. After the , it was simply both.\nSecond, any arrow shot with it could be transformed into a magic missile spell twice a day. Although a minor spell, this could even work with magical arrows and preserve their own powers to devastating effectâ€”an arrow of slaying fired this way would never miss. After 1372 DR, it became a brilliant energy arrow, also twice a day.\nMoreover, the bow improved the archers vision such that they could shoot farther, up to  at the longest range, and more accurately at any range.\nFinally, when held or when carried on the back, the bow granted the effects of an amulet of protection against detection and location.\nTo craft another such bow would require use of the spells clairaudience/clairvoyance, continual flame, gaseous form, and nondetection, as well as amazing skill in the crafting of magical weapons.\nAlthough considered priceless, it might fetch 50,000 gp if stolen but could be valued at 102,900 gp.\nThe Bow of Hosark was a thing of mystery, with its origin, its history, its secrets, and even its name completely unknown. Sages could not identify it nor associate it with any known artifact. Any legend lore spells cast on it only created a beautiful illusion of the face of an elven maiden who requested the bows bearer to \"take care of the Horn of Moons Dawning\".\nCirca 1338 DR, an elven woodsman of the High Forest known as Hosark left his bow and armor to his ward, Travis Deepdell, before he went west to Evermeet. Not knowing either Hosarks or the bows stories, Travis simply named it the Bow of Hosark in honor of his mentor. Travis carried it with him while he worked as a guide through the High Forest and later adventured with the Knights of the Sword Coast, and finally retired to Waterdeep to run the Safehaven Inn, where it was safely hidden with the Knights other treasures. Hed had the Bow of Hosark for three decades as of 1368 DR, and he still didnt know anything about it either.\nYet, for all its mysteries, the Bow of Hosark was coveted by many who were aware of it and its power and sought to steal it away. One of the most notorious who desired it was the infamous crime lord Elaith Craulnobur. Despite this, it was still in Traviss possession as of 1372 DR.\n* Hosark\n* Travis Deepdell"
