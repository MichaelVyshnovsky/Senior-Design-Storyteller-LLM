Acidic burst was a magical quality that could be applied to weapons, making them corrosive and causing them to spew a burst of acid on a critical strike. This did not injure the wielder. If ranged weapons were given this quality, the effects applied to any ammunition loaded into them.
One of several spells could be used in the creation of acidic burst weapons, including acid fog, acid storm, Melfs acid arrow, or storm of vengeance.
