'''''Acidic burst''''' was a [[weapon quality|magical quality]] that could be applied to weapons, making them [[Corrosive (weapon quality)|corrosive]] and causing them to spew a burst of [[acid]] on a critical strike. This did not injure the wielder. If ranged weapons were given this quality, the effects applied to any ammunition loaded into them.

==Creation==
One of several spells could be used in the creation of ''acidic burst'' weapons, including ''[[acid fog]]'', ''[[acid storm]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', or ''[[storm of vengeance]]''.
