{{Quote
|A ring blessed with [[Amaunator]]'s love.
}}
==Description==
The ring was a simple [[gold]]en band that shone brightly in the light.

==Powers==
''Glorious Dawn'' protected the wearer from entropic [[negative energy]], and could prevent them from being slain instantly by especially powerful effects. It further protected the wearer by flashing a bright, burning light at attackers.

==History==
The ring was awarded to brave [[adventurer]]s who had gone into [[Wheloon Prison]] in aid of [[Fordwin]] and his team, overcoming the [[Sharran]] priests [[Stanwicke Gall]] and [[Tulla Chymbal]] in the process.
