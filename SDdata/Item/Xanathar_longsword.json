        "mainbody": "Xanathar longswords were enchanted blades used by the members of the Xanathars Thieves Guild of Waterdeep circa 1372 DR.\nThese blades bore the hallmarks of the Xanathars Thieves Guild making it easily identifiable, often used to intimidate the Guilds marks.\nThese longswords were enchanted to make it easier for the user to hit their target and deal more damage upon successful hit. The design of the blades gave them perfect balance and aided the users quick movements in combat allowing easier tumbles and dodges.\nXanathar longswords were in possession of the agents of the infamous thieves guild circa 1372 DR. One such longsword was owned by Nakoto, a pale-faced agent of Xanathars in Daggerford extorting the short-termed duke of the city Matagar Bugo."
