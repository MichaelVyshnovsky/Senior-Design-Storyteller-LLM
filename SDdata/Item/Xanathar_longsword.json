        "Powers": "These [[longsword]]s were enchanted to make it easier for the user to hit their target and deal more damage upon successful hit. The design of the blades gave them perfect balance and aided the user's quick movements in combat allowing easier tumbles and dodges.",
        "History": "''Xanathar longswords'' were in possession of the agents of the infamous thieves' guild ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]. One such longsword was owned by [[Nakoto]], a pale-faced agent of Xanathar's in Daggerford extorting the short-termed duke of the city [[Matagar Bugo]]."
