        "mainbody": "'''''Whispering staff''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[goblin]] [[ironwood]] [[staff]], once wielded by [[sorcerer]] [[Caballus]].",
        "Description": "The staff was short, carved to accommodate a goblin so that a taller humanoid would wield it as a one-handed bludgeon with ease. ''Whispering staff'' was carved with snaking runes. Most were decorative gibberish, apart from a ''rune of accuracy'' and a ''rune of wounding'' that gave the staff its powers.",
        "Powers": "''Whispering staff'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and had a very slight chance of ''[[silence|silencing]]'' a target upon a successful strike. Additionally, ''whispering staff'' enhanced the wielder skills to move soundlessly.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the city of [[Targos]] laid besieged by a force of savage [[goblinoid]]s of the north. A goblin sorcerer named Caballus led an assault on the town and flooded the city with raiders after magically penetrating its fortifications. Caballus wielded his ''whispering staff'' when he closed with a band of mercenaries from [[Luskan]]. Subsequently, the sorcerer was slain, and ''whispering staff'' changed owners."
