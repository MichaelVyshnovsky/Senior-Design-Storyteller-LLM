Giantbreaker was a legendary crossbow that possessed an incredibly impactful shot.
Whenever a bolt fired from Giantbreaker struck a creature, they would reel back for a matter of moments.
Giantbreakers name originated from a story of when an elven ranger wielded it to great effect. Using only this weapon, the elf managed to defeat nearly two dozen hill giants on their own.
