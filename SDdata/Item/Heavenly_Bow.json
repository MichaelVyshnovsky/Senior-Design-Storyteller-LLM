        "mainbody": "The Heavenly Bow was an exotic enchanted longbow once wielded by solars of the Celestial planes.\nEverything about the Heavenly Bow was perfection. Its mere creation was unachievable by any of the most skilled mortal hands. The materials used for its creation were unknown to anyone on the Prime Material plane. Because of these things, it was believed that this powerful bow is of Upper planes origins.\nThis huge longbow was imbued with a potent +6 enchantment.
