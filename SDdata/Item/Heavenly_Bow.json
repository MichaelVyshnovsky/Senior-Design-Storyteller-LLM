        "mainbody": "The '''''Heavenly Bow''''' was an exotic [[enchanted]] [[longbow]] once wielded by [[solar]]s of the [[Celestial planes]].",
        "Description": "Everything about the ''Heavenly Bow'' was perfection. It's mere creation was unachievable by any of the most skilled mortal hands. The materials used for its creation were unknown to anyone on the [[Prime Material plane]]. Because of these things, it was believed that this powerful bow is of [[Upper planes]] origins.",
        "Powers": "This huge longbow was imbued with a potent ''+6'' enchantment. This weapon dramatically increased damage done with critical lucky hits, allowed even an unexperienced wielder to land perfect point-blank shots, and rapidly shower the targets with [[arrow]]s. Additionally, the ''Heavenly Bow'' glowed with a bright yellow light at the radius of {{SI|20'|'\"|long=yes}}",
        "History": "Long before [[1374 DR]], the ''Heavenly Bow'' was sealed underneath a chasm-ridden plane in [[Thar]], not far from the swamps of [[Iyrauroth]]. This celestial bow was wielded by the unnamed [[fallen solar]] who was the reason for the chasms that scarred the land around her magical prison."
