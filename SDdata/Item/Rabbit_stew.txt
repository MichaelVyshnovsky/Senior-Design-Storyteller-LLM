Rabbit stew was a simple but hearty food, especially popular on the road due to the availability of most ingredients, eaten across the Realms from Waterdeep and all the way to Tu Lung.
This hot and thick stew was usually cooked with a freshly slaughtered rabbit, available in abundance across Faer√ªn. The rich gravy was filled with cooked rabbit juices, toasted bread ends, and cornucopia of herbs.
Rabbit stew was a commonly cooked food along the tradeways of Cormyr, in Espar, and along the Kings Road,
In Daggerdale of the Dalelands, rabbit stew could be found served with buttered hardbread.
In Tu Lung, Kara-Tur, rabbit stew was served as the staple during the Festival to Welcome the Ethers. The rabbit was deboned except for its kneecaps and cooked in the stew. Finding the kneecap bone in ones serving was considered lucky and was a good omen that often resulted in marriage or treasure the following year.
In ancient city of Narthil, rabbit strew was served at the Myrkiels Rest and often accompanied with fresh butter-bread.
In 1348 DR, Lady Narantha Crownsilver of House Crownsilver, wielded a heaping serving of rabbit stew as her weapon of choice against Irlgar Delbossan, who accompanied the young woman to her tutor, Lord Hezom of Espar.
