'''Rabbit stew''' was a simple but hearty food, especially popular on the road due to the availability of most ingredients, eaten across the Realms from [[Waterdeep]] and all the way to [[T'u Lung]].

==Description==
This hot and thick stew was usually cooked with a freshly slaughtered [[rabbit]], available in abundance across [[Faer√ªn]]. The rich gravy was filled with cooked rabbit juices, toasted [[bread]] ends, and cornucopia of [[herb]]s.

==Availability==
Rabbit stew was a commonly cooked food along the tradeways of [[Cormyr]], in [[Espar]], and along the [[King's Road]],

In [[Daggerdale]] of the [[Dalelands]], rabbit stew could be found served with [[butter]]ed [[hardbread]].

In T'u Lung, [[Kara-Tur]], rabbit stew was served as the staple during the [[Festival to Welcome the Ethers]]. The rabbit was deboned except for its kneecaps and cooked in the stew. Finding the kneecap bone in one's serving was considered lucky and was a good omen that often resulted in marriage or treasure the following year.

In ancient city of [[Narthil]], rabbit strew was served at the [[Myrkiel's Rest]] and often accompanied with fresh [[butter-bread]].

==History==
In [[1348 DR]], Lady [[Narantha Crownsilver]] of [[House Crownsilver]], wielded a heaping serving of rabbit stew as her weapon of choice against [[Irlgar Delbossan]], who accompanied the young woman to her tutor, Lord [[Hezom]] of Espar.
