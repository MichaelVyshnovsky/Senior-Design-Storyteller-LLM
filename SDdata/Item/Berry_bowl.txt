Berry bowls were a simple type of gnomish highsunfeat dessert from the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast.
Berry bowls were just that – bowls filled with a variety of berries, depending on what was in season. The berries were drizzled with sugar sauce.
Berry bowls were the only alternative to the chocolate crab cakes at a gnomish out-of-the way café in Ravens Bluff called Le PoTeete Café in the late 14 century DR. More adventurous customers preferred strange but delicious chocolate crab cakes.
