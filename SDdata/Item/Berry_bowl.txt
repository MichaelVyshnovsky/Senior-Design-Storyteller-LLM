'''Berry bowls''' were a simple type of [[gnome|gnomish]] highsunfeat dessert from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]].

==Description==
Berry bowls were just that – bowls filled with a variety of berries, depending on what was in season. The berries were drizzled with [[sugar]] sauce.

==History==
Berry bowls were the only alternative to the [[chocolate crab cake]]s at a gnomish out-of-the way café in Ravens Bluff called [[Le PoTeete Café]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. More adventurous customers preferred strange but delicious chocolate crab cakes.
