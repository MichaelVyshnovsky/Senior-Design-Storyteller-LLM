'''''Rope of mending''''' was a [[magic]]al [[rope]].

==Powers==
A ''rope of mending'' looked like a regular rope made of hemp. It was sold in coils of 50 feet (15 meters). If the rope was cut into smaller lengths, it could be mended by uttering a special command word. The shortened lengths had to be in contact with one another and not in use for the mending to be successful. If a shortened length was lost, the total length of a ''rope of mending'' was shortened by the length of the piece that was lost.
