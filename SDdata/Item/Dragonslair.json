        "mainbody": "'''''Dragonslair''''' (pronounced \"Dragonslayer\") was a [[magic]]al [[longsword]] that served as a [[phylactery]] for the [[dracolich]] [[Dretchroyaster]].",
        "Name": "Dretchroyaster, ever fond of riddles, named the sword ''Dragonslair'' as a pun on the term \"dragon's lair\", which is pronounced nigh identically to \"dragonslayer\". The sword was, after all, created to serve as a phylactery (and therefore a dragon's lair, in a sense), yet it was also forged to kill green dragons.",
        "Description": {
            "Classification": "''Dragonslair'' was one of the ''[[sword of dragonblood|swords of dragonblood]]'',"
        },
        "Powers": "In addition to being a powerful [[Item enchantment|enchanted weapon]] in its own right, ''Dragonslair'' possessed a number of special powers and properties. The blade was especially deadly when wielded against green dragons, but was significantly less powerful when swung against any type of dracolich (and especially a green dracolich, like its master).\n\nThe ''rogue stone'' set in the pommel had been enchanted with twelve individual ''[[gemjump]]'' spells from twelve of its previous owners, all of whom were [[archmage|archmagi]], seven of whom were associated with the [[Cult of the Dragon]], yet none of these castings were known to the Cult at large. The ''gemjump'' effect allowed these wizards to immediately ''[[teleport]]'' to ''Dragonslair''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s location and retrieve it, provided it wasn't in an area of [[Dead-magic zone|dead magic]] or stuck in an ''[[anti-magic shell]]''.\n\nIn the event that Dretchroyaster was bested in combat, his spirit would enter the ''rogue stone'' and imbue ''Dragonslair'' with a plethora of additional powers. Perhaps most crucially, it would transform into a [[Sentient item|sentient weapon]] inhabited by Dretchroyaster himself. The dracolich would attempt to influence ''Dragonslair''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s wielder toward his goal: returning to dracolich form by seizing a [[dragon]]'s corpse (preferably a green one) and then devouring Dretchroyaster's original body. The dracolich's spirit would readily employ spells of ''[[suggestion]]'' to achieve this, provided he could not simply dominate the wielder into his service.\n\nIf Dretchroyaster's spirit came to dwell in the phylactery-stone, the wielder would be empowered with the ability to cast a number of spells, such as ''[[warp wood]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', and ''[[entangle]]''. They would also be able to detect the closest green dragon on the same [[Cosmology|plane of existence]] (if any), and would become immune to the deleterious effects of gases.\n\nFinally, ''Dragonslair'' was enchanted with a permanent ''[[undetectable alignment]]'' spell that could not be dispelled.",
        "History": "The history of ''Dragonslair'' began with the Cult of the Dragon's courting of Dretchroyaster. Although the Cult had long tried to convince the green dragon to become a dracolich, it took two near-death experiences at the hands of [[adventurer]]s before Dretchroyaster acceded. The first occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1279}}, when he was nearly slain by the [[Crossed Swords]], a coalition of independent adventuring companies. The second occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, when the [[Merry Marauders]] attacked and nearly killed Dretchroyaster near [[Myth Drannor]]. Unbeknownst to Dretchroyaster, the Merry Marauders had been hired by [[Larkonlan]], a [[wizard]] in the Cult's [[Sembia]]n cell, who wished to make the green dragon question his own mortality. Larkonlan had also outfitted the adventurers with ''swords of dragonblood'', weapons specifically forged to harm Dretchroyaster (and dragons in general).\n\nAlthough he survived the encounter, barely, Dretchroyaster became fearful of adventurers and grew closer to the Cult of the Dragon, even accepting their offer of a new, safer lair. Eventually, in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Dretchroyaster agreed to become a dracolich. He insisted, however, that his phylactery contain a number of safety features to ensure his survival.\n\nWorking in tandem with a [[duergar]] master smith, Larkonlan created ''Dragonslair'' to meet Dretchroyaster's demands, modeling the blade and its enchantments on the very ''swords of dragonblood'' that had nearly killed the dragon fourteen years earlier."
