The '''''orb of isolation''''' was a magical item used in the defense of [[Crosswinds Keep]].

==Description==
The ''orb'' was a glass sphere, glowing blue with magical power.

==Powers==
With a command word, the ''orb of isolation'' hovered in place and sealed the area within {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} against planar travel, in a manner similar to ''[[dimensional lock]]''. The warded area could be shaped so long as it remained within the distance limit. The orb's power prevented the ingress of any creature into the warded area, acting as an invisible and impenetrable barrier. Up to three gaps could be created at the user's option on the barrier: these gaps could be any size from {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} to {{SI|200|feet|long=yes}}.

Portals within the warded area had an even stranger effect; they malfunctioned most of the time, and had a further effect on [[outsider]]s, who became unable to wander further than {{SI|300|feet|long=yes}} from a portal through which they had entered the warded area. This effect could be ended for any given outsider with a ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[miracle]]'', ''[[break enchantment]]'' or ''[[remove curse]]'' powerful enough to cancel the orb's magic, or it could be broken for all of them by shutting down the orb.

==History==
The ''orb of isolation'' was part of the defenses of [[Crosswinds Keep]] as of {{yearlink|1372}}.
