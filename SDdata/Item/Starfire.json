        "mainbody": "'''''Starfire''''', also known as the '''starfire scepter''', was a powerful [[magic]]al [[wand]] of [[drow]] design.",
        "Description": "The wand had the unique ability to destroy incoming magical projectiles, imbue defensive magic upon the wielder's allies, and resist the fiery breath of [[red dragon]]s.",
        "History": "In ancient history, starfire was used by a drow contingent to overtake the secluded village of [[Torzac]]. The leader of the contingent managed to dissipate the magical missiles fired at him by the village [[mage]]. After this, the village was promptly razed, and the villagers were slaughtered.\n\nIt was at this location that the [[Darkmoon]] temple was constructed, but was later destroyed by the inter-house fighting between the dark elves.\n\nUpon the reconstruction of the temple around [[1358 DR]], [[Wently Kelso]] was given a vision of starfire and its use in the conquest of Torzac. He, with much effort, made his way to the village site, but was unable to find the scepter that he believed would be of high scholarly value. His guide, [[Insal]], decided to the infiltrate the evil temple himself to try and get his hands on starfire.\n\nThe [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] may have acquired the magical scepter, and used it to slay the leader of Darkmoon, [[Dran Draggore]], himself."
