Secomber sour vinegar was a popular condiment that originated from the peaceful town of Secomber.
The condiment was made in halfling vineyards northwest of Secomber in the far northern Western Heartlands. They used unripe sour dry white grapes for the recipe. It was served with pan-fried quipper fish as evenfeast at the Yawning Portal in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep.
