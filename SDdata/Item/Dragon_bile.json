        "Description": "Apart from bones and scales, dragon's bile was perhaps the most sought-after part of a slain wyrm. A competent poison maker could turn the draconic substance into a poison of varied strengths. The strongest type of dragon bile was collected from ancient dragons and wielded only by the most deadly of assassins.",
        "Powers": "Dragon bile was most often used to coat [[blade]]s. When the poison was introduced onto a target's skin or in their bloodstream, the substance started sapping their strength. Despite dragon bile rarely causing death, its weakening effect was devastatingly dangerous. A single vial of the substance usually held enough poison for five applications.\n\nDragon bile was commonly used as poison in [[trap]]s or as coating for [[lock]]s or other object prone to be touched by [[thieves]] and rogues.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, dragon bile was sold by [[mind flayer]]s of the illithid black market hidden in the mountains west of [[Samargol]] in the jungles of [[Samarach]]."
