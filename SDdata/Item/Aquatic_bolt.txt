'''''Aquatic bolts''''' were [[enchanted]] projectiles used by aquatic [[humanoid]]s, sailors, and pirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]] and the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Powers==
These [[bolt]]s were designed and enchanted to be as deadly underwater as on the surface. When an ''aquatic bolt'' hit its target, the projectile's tip released a small but deadly burst of [[acid]]. Additionally, these bolts were especially effective against reptilian creatures.

==History==
''Aquatic bolts'' were in common use in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Captain [[Allendry]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale.
