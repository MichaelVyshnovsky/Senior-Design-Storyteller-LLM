As the Pegleg of Immurk the Invincible remained attached to its owner, it granted them knowledge and proficiencies in navigation, seamanship, rope usage, and swimming and granted them weather sense. Additionally, the prosthetic made them immune to seasickness. It also gave the owner knowledge of marine weaponry, such as harpoons and cutlasses. When the Pegleg of Immurk the Invincible was tapped against an object, it discharged the knock spell three times per day. It also allowed the wearer to sense gold within an object being tapped by the leg. Lastly, it allowed the wearer to summon a parrot familiar that became bonded to the person, be they a wizard or any other profession.\nUnbeknownst to most, Immurk was not just a fearsome pirate but also a mage. Sometime in the middle of his pirating life, Immurk lost his leg during boarding of an enemy ship. To replace his lost limb, Immurk created an enchanted prosthetic. In 1201 DR, Immurk and his magic prosthetic were lost at sea, and the legends of the Pegleg of Immurk the Invincible spread from one adventurer to the next."
