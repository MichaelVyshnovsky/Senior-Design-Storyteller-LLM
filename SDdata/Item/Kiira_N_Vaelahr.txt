The '''''[[kiira N'Vaelahr]]''''' were 24 gems were used by the undercover agents of the [[N'Vaelahr]] before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]]. They stored memories and magic like a regular ''[[kiira]]'', but also facilitated mental communication.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] attached a stone like this to the forehead of [[Tsarra Chaadren]] to avoid her mind being overloaded by his thoughts after the pair became linked during a magical explosion.
