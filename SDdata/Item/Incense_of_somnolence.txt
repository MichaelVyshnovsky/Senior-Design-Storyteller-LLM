'''''Incense of somnolence''''' was a type of sleep-inducing [[incense]] from the southern land of [[wizards]]â€“[[Halruaa]].''The Magehound'' gives no name to the incense. This page uses a descriptive name.

==Description==
''Incense of somnolence'' was a non-magical drug-like incense made from a blend of powerful [[herb]]s. It could affect even creatures normally resistant or immune to [[magic]], both [[arcane]] and [[divine]]. Together with consumed herbal infusions, ''incense of somnolence'' could keep a creature asleep as long as the dosage and exposure were regulated. In smaller dosages, or when a creature was weaned off its effects, the incense still had an effect, making the targets disorientated and confused.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Kiva]], a [[Halruaan magehound|Halruaan inquisitrix]] who used ''incense of somnolence'' and herbal infusions to keep a magic-resistant [[jordaini]] [[Andris]] asleep for four days in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.
