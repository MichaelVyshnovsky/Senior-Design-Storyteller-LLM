A philter of drunkenness was a magical potion that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider at the bottom than they were at the top.
This potion caused extreme inebriation immediately after consumption.
The period of drunkenness lasted for 6 hours, and was followed by a terrible hangover that lasted for another 3 hours.
