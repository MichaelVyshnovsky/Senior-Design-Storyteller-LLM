However, taking into account that fact that avatars of deities almost always carry their favored weapons and that the title of Clangeddin is the \"Lord of the Twin Axes\", they are assumed to be the same.\nThe avatar of Clangedin wielded two of these +4 battleaxes that were made of mithril, and could be thrown up to .
