'''''Swordsman's belt''''' were [[enchanted]] [[belt]]s created by [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] for the distinguished [[Purple Dragons]] of [[Cormyr]].

==Powers==
These were two types of these belts. Regular ''swordsman's belts'' and much more powerful ''greater swordsman's belts''. Both types were enchanted to shield their wearers from slashing damage; however, the greater versions of ''swordsman's belts''' enchantments were significantly more potent.

==History==
Sometime before King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] perished in [[1371 DR]], he commissioned these belts from his Royal Magician Vangerdahast Aeiulvana to honor the most dedicated and venerated Purple Dragons of his realm. By [[1372 DR]], his reigning daughter [[Alusair Obarskyr]] continued the tradition, awarding ''swordsman's belts'' and sometimes even offering them to capable adventurers as an incentive to serve the Dragon Throne.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], there were quite a few of these enchanted belts scattered around the [[Sword Coast]], found in [[Neverwinter]]'s various shops, and temples of [[Hillsfar]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Dela Nereth]], a black market merchant of the [[Bloodsailors]] of [[Neverwinter]] in [[1372 DR]].
