Swordsmans belt were enchanted belts created by Vangerdahast Aeiulvana for the distinguished Purple Dragons of Cormyr.
These were two types of these belts. Regular swordsmans belts and much more powerful greater swordsmans belts. Both types were enchanted to shield their wearers from slashing damage however, the greater versions of swordsmans belts enchantments were significantly more potent.
Sometime before King Azoun Obarskyr IV perished in 1371 DR, he commissioned these belts from his Royal Magician Vangerdahast Aeiulvana to honor the most dedicated and venerated Purple Dragons of his realm. By 1372 DR, his reigning daughter Alusair Obarskyr continued the tradition, awarding swordsmans belts and sometimes even offering them to capable adventurers as an incentive to serve the Dragon Throne.
By the late 14 century DR, there were quite a few of these enchanted belts scattered around the Sword Coast, found in Neverwinters various shops, and temples of Hillsfar.
