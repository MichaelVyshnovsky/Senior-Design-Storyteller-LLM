        "Powers": "''Shadoweir amulets'' could only be used by [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s who were members of the [[church of Mielikki]]. Each [[amulet]] possessed several charges, eight on average. The wearers of these amulets could call on the power of [[Mielikki|their goddess]] to cast ''[[entangle]]'' (consumed one charge), ''[[one with the land]]'' (two charges), and ''[[vine mine]]'' (three charges).",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, ''Shadoweir amulets'' were virtually unseen outside the Mielikkian faith. One such amulet was thought to have been taken off a dead Shadoweir by a [[doppelganger]] named [[Devalle]], who assumed the slain ranger's identity in service of the [[Unseen]] and [[Eremuth Silverwind]]. Eventually, the doppelganger was slain by the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The agents of the Unseen attempted to spring an unsuccessful ambush on the adventurer and companions outside the city of [[Elmwood]] in the [[Moonsea]] region."
