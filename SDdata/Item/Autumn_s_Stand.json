        "mainbody": "Autumns Stand was a pair of enchanted boots worn by druids. They could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nThey had thin soles that crackled as the wearer walked, creating a similar sensation to walking on soft fallen leaves.\nWearers of these boots could move swiftly and confidently across any terrain without distraction, as if under the influence of a find the path spell.\n* Pikel Bouldershoulder, a dwarven druid, was said to own a pair as of the late 15 century DR."
