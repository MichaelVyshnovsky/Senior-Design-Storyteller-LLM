A Mac-Fuirmidh cittern () was a masterwork magic cittern and one of the Instruments of the Bards.
Mac-Fuirmidh citterns were pear-shaped citterns similar to lutes, superior in every way to ordinary citterns. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.
Bards wielding a Mac-Fuirmidh cittern had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.
Like all Instruments of the Bards, these citterns had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a Mac-Fuirmidh cittern could invoke the spells fly, invisibility, levitate, protection from evil and good, barkskin, cure wounds and fog cloud each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.
The first Mac-Fuirmidh citterns were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer. He used them to test and reward the students of the Mac-Fuirmidh level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.
Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataers honor.
