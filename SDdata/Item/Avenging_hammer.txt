An '''''avenging hammer''''' was a [[magic]]al [[warhammer]] that only the physically strongest could wield. 

==Powers==
In battle, the ''avenging hammer'' was functionally equivalent to a ''[[lucern hammer]] +2''. Upon striking an opponent wearing metal [[armor]] (such as [[chainmail]] or [[plate mail]]), there was a slight chance that the hammer would destroy the armor, shattering it into pieces and rendering it completely useless.
