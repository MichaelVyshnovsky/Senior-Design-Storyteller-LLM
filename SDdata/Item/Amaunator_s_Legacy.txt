'''''Amaunator's Legacy''''' was a unique enchanted [[bastard sword]] created by [[Pouldinus]], one of the [[Archwizard]]s of [[Netheril]].

==Description==
This [[sword]] was an extremely old shiny [[brass]] [[weapon]].

==Powers==
''Amaunator's Legacy'' was a weapon with a powerful ''+3'' enchantment and its magics were deadly to the [[undead]]. When the sword was used against the undead, it burned and sizzled them with magical flames. There was also a small chance of the sword unleashing the ''[[Beltyn's burning blood]]'' [[spell]] at any creature it stricken. Additionally, the sword allowed the wielder to cast the ''[[sunray]]'' spell once per day at the range of {{SI|100'|'"|long=yes}}.

==History==
''Amaunator's Legacy'' was created more than 3,000 years before [[Dale Reckoning]] by Pouldinus to be gifted to his friend, a stern [[warrior]] who venerated [[Amaunator]], the Keeper of the Eternal Sun. [[Kalamnin]] used the sword to help follow the deity's edicts exactly. ''Amaunator's Legacy'' remained in Kalamnin's hand throughout his travels and left only when the warrior was slain in battle against several dozens of [[nycadaemon]]s. ''Amaunator's Legacy'' was claimed by the [[fiend]]s' summoner, the [[Sorcerer]] named [[Ylmandi]]. The summoner's family owned the bastard sword until the fall of Netheril during [[Karsus's Folly]]. 

The sword reappeared once again in the {{YearlinkName|1281}} in the hands of a [[halfling]] [[priest]] of [[Waukeen]] of the [[Golden Lodge]] in the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]].
