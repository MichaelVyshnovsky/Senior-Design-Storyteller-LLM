        "Powers": "Like other magical oils, ''oil of mage armor'' were applied topically. Once the substance was rubbed into the creature's skin, it granted them the protective magics, similar to the effects of the ''[[mage armor]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], [[necromancer]]s of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], who took over the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] under the leadership of [[Kya Mordrayn]], carried ''oils of mage armor'' as part of the standard cult agents' equipment."
