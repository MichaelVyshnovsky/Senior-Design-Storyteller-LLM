        "mainbody": "ils of mage armor were enchanted oils that were imbued with defensive magics.\nLike other magical oils, oil of mage armor were applied topically. Once the substance was rubbed into the creatures skin, it granted them the protective magics, similar to the effects of the mage armor spell.\nIn 1369 DR, necromancers of the Cult of the Dragon, who took over the ruins of Myth Drannor under the leadership of Kya Mordrayn, carried oils of mage armor as part of the standard cult agents equipment."
