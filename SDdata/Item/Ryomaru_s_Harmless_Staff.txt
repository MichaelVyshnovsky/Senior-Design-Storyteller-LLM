'''''Ryomaru's Harmless Staff''''' was believed to be an ironically named, uniquely [[enchanted]], and engineered [[quarterstaff]] that was created for [[Ryomaru]], a famous assassin from the [[Kumo]] clan of [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
It appeared to be an unassuming, sturdy quarterstaff. It was hollow and filled with numerous separate compartments, each hiding various implements of subtle death – [[poison]]ous powders, spring-loaded [[dart]]s, chains, spikes, hooks, along with many others.

==Powers==
When wielded in combat, each of the weapon's many hidden compartments had a chance of being activated and dispensing punishment in addition to the staff's normal bludgeoning. As such, ''Ryomaru's Harmless Staff'' was dangerous in the hands of untrained and unaware wielders. There was always a chance that unskilled users could poison or damage themselves. Each strike with the weapon had a set chance of activating its many little "tricks." There was a 15% chance ''Three- Jade Mist'' could be puffed in the target's face, poisoning them; the ''Flying Eight Darts'' compartment had a 5% probability of springing darts into the target; ''Iron Octopus'' was a complicated collection of weighted chains that had a 5% chance of pummeling the targets; the compartment creatively named ''Sage Closes Fan'' sprung sharp piercing implements at the target with only 10% chance; ''Bothersome Child'' compartment had 5% of shocking the target with electricity; the ''Double Happiness'' compartment had 10% chance of hitting the targets with an additional bludgeon; the ''Spitting Crone'' compartment had a 10% chance of spraying liquid poison onto the targets; and lastly, ''Four Demon Hell Murder'' – the most dangerous of all compartments in ''Ryomaru's Harmless Staff'', had a 1% chance of unleashing the ''[[slay living]]'' [[spell]], immediately ending the life of any living targets.

==History==
The ''Harmless Staff'' was in the hands of Ryomaru many years before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Strangely enough, he only wielded the quarterstaff on three spy missions before depositing it with the Kumo clan's [[Hojori Temple]] in Kozakura. It was believed that Ryomaru found more devious and deadly weapons to use instead of the ''Harmless Staff''. Eventually, the weapon was stolen by "Chicken" [[Wu-Wei]], a young [[tattoo]]ed [[monk]] and [[thief]] from [[Shou Lung]]. The Kumo assassins pursued the thief to Shou Lung, forcing him to cross the [[Eastern Ocean]] and settle in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]]. Kumo clan continued the pursuit. It sent three more assassins after "Chicken," one was to fund and kill the original group of assassins as punishment for the failure. The second – pursued Wu-Wei across the seas. The third assassin was tasked with torturing and assassination of Wu-Wei's every relative.

Despite their best attempts, "Chicken" spent the rest of his life comfortably, adventuring in Faerûn, and later in life – running a small [[tobacco]] shop. The Daring Chicken sold every piece of the stolen Kumo clan's treasure, including ''Ryomaru's Harmless Staff'', and died happy of old age. When the assassins at last found Wiu-Wei, there was nothing left of the man but a tombstone.

Sometime later, ''Ryomaru's Harmless Staff'' found its way into the [[Black Raven Monastery]], where it was still securely stashed away as of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}.
