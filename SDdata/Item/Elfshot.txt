'''''Elfshot''''' arrows were enchanted weapons used to [[paralyze]] an enemy without causing them physical harm.

==Uses==
The enchantment on these arrows made it easier for them to strike their target. Upon striking true they would paralyze the target then vanish without causing harm. The target remained paralyzed anywhere from several minutes to nearly half an hour.

These arrows were typically used by [[elves]].

==Notable Users==
The elven guards of [[Goldenleaf Stables]] used ''elfshot'' arrows.
