Vampiric was a quality that could be applied to magical weapons caused the wielder to drain the health of one injured by it.
When the weapon struck a living opponent, if they did not have the fortitude to resist, there was a chance that some of the opponents life energy would be drained and transferred to the wielder. This would heal their injuries, but any extra health gained by the wielder disappeared after about an hour.
A crafter of magic weapons required the vampiric touch spell.
