|I'd grown tired of every idiot with a sword thinking they could get a bit of easy money by harassing this old man. Hmph! Force ends up solving nothing, so I created my amulet to prove to them that my open fist is more powerful than their closed ones.

==Description==
The [[jewel]] of the [[amulet]] was a large [[sapphire]] carved into the shape of a fist. The sapphire hung on a chain of [[platinum]] links.

==Powers==
When activated by being touched or with a comnmand word, the amulet activated. The hand opened up, and shot a beam of blue light at its target, enveloping them in Alcedor's [[magic]]. The victims ''held'' by the magic of the amulet also fell under the influence of a ''[[vampiric touch]]'' spell, feeling their life force drain away to heal the wearer of the amulet if they so desired.

==History==
The ''amulet of Acledor'' was created by [[Alcedor Kolat]] and always worn by him.
