        "Powers": "These bracers imparted physical protection on the chillbringer as if they were ''[[bracers of defense]]''. Additionally, ice bracers behaved like a ''[[ring of warmth]]'' and protected the wearer from cold from both weather and magical cold-based attacks.",
        "History": "Ice bracers were made by high-ranking clergy of Auril during the [[Feast of the Moon]] using ice taken from the [[Great Glacier]]. The magic infusing the bracers allowed them to last until [[Greengrass]]."
