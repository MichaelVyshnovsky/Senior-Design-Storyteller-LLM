        "mainbody": "'''Augelite''' was an [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] found in [[Faer√ªn]]. and worn by [[priest]]s of [[Akadi]] for jewelry and [[holy symbol]]s.",
        "Description": "This gemstone was transparent, colorless, and soft enough to carve without special tools or exceptional skill, but too soft for intricate carving because it tended to split. A typical specimen had a base value of 10 [[gp]].",
        "Powers": "The power of this stone was its antipathy to [[magic]]. Spells were slightly easier to resist, and magically-induced injury was slightly lessened within a 10 ft (3 m) radius around an augelite gem."
