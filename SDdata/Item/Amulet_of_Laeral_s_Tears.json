        "mainbody": "Amulets of Laerals tears were named after the famed sorceress, Laeral Silverhand. They temporarily bestowed greater health upon those who wore the amulet against their skin.\nA variant of these amulets, known as an Amulet of Dark Blessing, were found among the drow of the Underdark and besides their appearance they functioned identically.\nStrung along these amulets were soft, brittle, and colorless fancy stone crystals known as Laerals tears. They were often large and kept a glossy, magnificent finish. The Underdark-wrought Amulets of Dark Blessing were crafted using a single iridescent black gemstone, however.\nAfter being expended, both versions of the amulet would crumble to dust.\nWhilst worn next to the skin the amulet bestowed a temporary increase to ones health. However, once this bonus health had been eroded (via injury) then the amulet crumbled into worthless dust.\nThe Witches of Rashemen used to craft these amulets using many large colorless stones.\n* City of the Spider Queen (amulets of dark blessing)\nFRAmulette des larmes de Laeral\nCategoryAmulets\nCategoryItems from the Underdark\nCategoryItems from Rashemen\nCategoryItems from Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nCategoryMagic items\nCategory1000-1499 gold pieces\nCategoryDrow items\nb3xvyfvf5tjd1l1cgb5fltywhuqkxz4"
