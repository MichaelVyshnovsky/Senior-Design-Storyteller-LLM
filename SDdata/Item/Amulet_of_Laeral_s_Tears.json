        "mainbody": "'''''Amulets of Laeral's tears''''' were named after the famed [[sorceress]], [[Laeral Silverhand]]. They temporarily bestowed greater health upon those who wore the amulet against their skin.\n\nA variant of these amulets, known as an '''''Amulet of Dark Blessing''''', were found among the [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]] and besides their appearance they functioned identically.",
        "Description": "Strung along these amulets were soft, brittle, and colorless fancy stone crystals known as [[Laeral's tears]]. They were often large and kept a glossy, magnificent finish. The Underdark-wrought ''Amulets of Dark Blessing'' were crafted using a single iridescent black gemstone, however.\n\nAfter being expended, both versions of the amulet would crumble to dust.",
        "Powers": "Whilst worn next to the skin the amulet bestowed a temporary increase to one's health. However, once this bonus health had been eroded (via injury) then the amulet crumbled into worthless dust.",
        "History": "The [[Witches of Rashemen]] used to craft these amulets using many large colorless stones.",
