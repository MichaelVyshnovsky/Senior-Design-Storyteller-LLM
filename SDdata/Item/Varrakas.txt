'''Varrakas''' was an ingested [[poison]] that was usually mixed with gravy or dark sauces.

==Description==
Varrakas had a thick, syrupy consistency with a slightly oily flavor. A single, black drop of the poison was enough to cause internal damage.

==Effects==
The poison was effective against any mammal. After consumption, varrakas entered the bloodstream disguised as a nutrient. Three to four hours later, the damage occurred. The more drops that were consumed, the greater the damage that occurred.

Oddly enough, the poison [[orvas]] served as an antidote to varrakas if it was insinuated into the bloodstream before the poisonous effects of varrakas could take place.

==History==
Varrakas was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as [[The Nathlum]]. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage, [[Lethchauntos|Lethchauntos the Black]], during his time spent with an [[orc]] tribe. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage, [[Phrandjas]] of [[Port Llast]] and sold to local [[alchemist]]s.
