A rapier was a one-handed, martial melee weapon in the sword family.
The rapier was a slender, sharply pointed sword often with a complex hilt designed to protect the wielding hand. The blade could be sharpened along some or all of the length of the blade or may not have any cutting edge at all. A typical rapier cost 20 gp and weighed .
Used mainly for thrusting and piercing attacks, it was favored by both fencers and duelists. Rapiers were relatively light blades and quite deadly in the hands of those properly trained, therefore they were classified as martial weapons.
