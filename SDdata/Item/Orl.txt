'''Orl''' crystals were only found in very soft rock inside "blue caves" such as those near [[Wheloon]], and were believed to be exclusive to the northern half of [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Orls occurred as long, symmetric, sharp-edged crystals and ranged in color from a dark, tawny yellow to orange to red. They were usually cut into faceted gems but some enthusiasts preferred to wear the natural crystals in a claw mount, for example. Red-hued orls commanded the highest price. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 gp.

Orls were considered sacred by followers of [[Bahgtru]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The red hue of orl was sacred to followers of [[Haela Brightaxe]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10, 12}}

==Powers==
Powdered orl could be mixed with powdered [[black opal]] to make a powerful explosive, but the amounts and proportions were not generally known except to some who practiced [[magic]]. To touch off an explosion, the mixture had to be exposed to an open flame in a particular way for ignition to occur. The resulting blast had a radius of 30 ft (9.1 m) and did great harm to creatures within this radius, also potentially destroying sturdy items up to 20 ft (6.1 m) from the center.

==Reputation==
Orl was considered a prized gem among the [[drow]].
