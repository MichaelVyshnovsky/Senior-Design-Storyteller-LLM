        "mainbody": "The '''''helm of the Scavenger''''' was a powerful [[spelljamming helm]] that was capable of keeping a vessel's [[air envelope]] fresh. It was the main propulsion system of the [[squid ship]] ''[[Scavenger (spelljammer)|Scavenger]]'' before being stolen by [[Halaster Blackcloak]].",
        "Description": "The ''helm of the Scavenger'' was an ornate high-backed wooden chair that resembled a throne. Its cushioned seat and its back rest were covered in black velvet decorated with silver stars.",
        "Powers": "The ''helm'' was capable of propelling and maneuvering a vessel between 1 and 100 tons by being placed aboard it. Once installed, it generated a fresh air envelope that was kept at a constant temperature of {{SI|70|F}} and a stable [[gravity plane]] aboard and around the vessel.\n\nIf a [[spellcaster]] attuned with the ''helm'', it granted the power to propel the vessel with a speed that increased depending on the magical power the caster had available at the time. This propulsion extended for water, air, and space navigation. It also granted the caster the ability to visualize the surroundings of any point aboard the ship. While attuned to the ''helm'', it was not possible to cast any [[spell]].\n\nAttuning with the ''helm of the Scavenger'' produced a sensation that resembled being immersed in warm water.",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Scavenger'' was captured by a magical ''[[gate]]'' while in orbit around [[Toril]] and placed in the [[Caverns of Ooze]] of [[Undermountain]] by  Halaster. In addition, the Mad Mage removed the ''helm of the Scavenger'' and placed it in the [[Mad Wizard's Lair]], effectively trapping the ship in Undermountain. The marooned captain [[N'ghathrod]] and its crew of [[orog]]s were forced to fend for themselves in the caverns."
