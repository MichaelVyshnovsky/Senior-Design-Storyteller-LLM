        "mainbody": "The helm of the Scavenger was a powerful spelljamming helm that was capable of keeping a vessels air envelope fresh. It was the main propulsion system of the squid ship Scavenger before being stolen by Halaster Blackcloak.\nThe helm of the Scavenger was an ornate high-backed wooden chair that resembled a throne. Its cushioned seat and its back rest were covered in black velvet decorated with silver stars.\nThe helm was capable of propelling and maneuvering a vessel between 1 and 100 tons by being placed aboard it. Once installed, it generated a fresh air envelope that was kept at a constant temperature of  and a stable gravity plane aboard and around the vessel.\nIf a spellcaster attuned with the helm, it granted the power to propel the vessel with a speed that increased depending on the magical power the caster had available at the time. This propulsion extended for water, air, and space navigation. It also granted the caster the ability to visualize the surroundings of any point aboard the ship. While attuned to the helm, it was not possible to cast any spell.\nAttuning with the helm of the Scavenger produced a sensation that resembled being immersed in warm water.\nSometime in the late 15 century DR, the Scavenger was captured by a magical gate while in orbit around Toril and placed in the Caverns of Ooze of Undermountain by  Halaster. In addition, the Mad Mage removed the helm of the Scavenger and placed it in the Mad Wizards Lair, effectively trapping the ship in Undermountain. The marooned captain Nghathrod and its crew of orogs were forced to fend for themselves in the caverns."
