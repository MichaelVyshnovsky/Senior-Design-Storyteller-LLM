        "mainbody": "figurehead of attacks was a type of figurehead of wondrous power, a humanoid wooden figure placed on the front of a spelljammer that enhanced the piloting abilities of, and granted additional powers to, the mage at the ships helm.\nThese types of figureheads were made from ash and embedded with rubies in its brow. Due to the unique magical powers of the figurehead, they were often placed on the deck of a spelljammer.\nA figurehead of attacks granted the ship greater maneuverability, allowing its pilot to sense the ship from the perspective of the figure itself. Furthermore, it could be animated by the mage, as long as they maintained concentration. While controlling the figurehead, the mage could attack with the construct, as if they were controlling an animated warrior with fists of hardwood. Any break in the mages concentration would cease the connection between the mage and the figurehead."
