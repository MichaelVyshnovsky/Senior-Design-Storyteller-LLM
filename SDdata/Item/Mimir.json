        "mainbody": "A '''''mimir''''', also known as a '''''Well of Knowledge''''' or a '''''Speaking Skull''''', was a variety of minor magical item unique to the [[Outlands]] that acted as a sort of encyclopedia.\n\n{{quote|''\"I am a mimir, a magical device designed to provide information. If you have stolen me, please be aware that, even now, bounty hunters are coming to claim me for justice.\"''|''Standard mimir introduction''<ref name=TotFW-p5>}}",
        "Etymology": "These magical objects were named by [[wizard]]s after [[Mimir (deity)|Mimir]], an incredibly wise [[power]] of the [[Norse pantheon]].<ref> Their alternative name, \"Well of Knowledge,\" was likely inspired by the [[Well of Mimir]],{{Speculation}} which some also referred to by the same name.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|5}}",
        "Description": "''Mimirs'' came in a variety of forms, including cubes, disks, leaves, stars, sunflowers (a popular choice among [[druid]]s), human skulls, animal skulls, butterflies, rib-bones, leering [[imp]]s, and many more. Regardless of their shape, a ''mimir'' was always made of a mysterious, silvery metal and had tight line patterns etched into it. This metal shone and would reflect light in rainbow hues. As no other object in the planes had ever been seen made of the same material, many assumed it was formed in the same process that created ''mimirs''.",
        "Powers": "A ''mimir'' allowed one to record information for later playback. The amount of auditory information they could store was unlimited. When a user pointed at and asked a ''mimir'' a question, it would respond a few seconds later in an instructive, conversational tone with any information it had been instilled with by its creator on the given subject. If a user asked a ''mimir'' where they stood in the Outlands, it would respond by stating what ring (layer) outward from the [[Spire]] the user was standing in, rather than giving any exact distance or location.\n\nMuch like an ''[[ioun stone]]'', these objects floated around and followed those who owned them. And unless allowed to float freely in air or water, a ''mimir'' would not respond to questions. They also would not function outside of the [[Outer Planes]]. If a user asked a ''mimir'' a question while on the [[Astral plane]], the [[Ethereal plane]], one of the [[Inner Planes]], or a [[Prime Material plane]] it would respond with a babble of gibberish.\n\nBeing a magical object, ''mimirs'' could be temporarily disabled with ''[[dispel magic]]''. The ''[[Silence, 15' radius]]'' [[spell]] and [[dead-magic zone]]s would render them inoperable, but return to functioning once removed from. And if a ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell was cast on it, a ''mimir'' would be sent into a gibbering fit.",
        "Availability": "''Mimirs'' were commonly sold in the Outlands, both in the city of [[Sigil]] and in the [[gate-town]]s. Across the Outer Planes, they were most commonly found in use in the [[Lower planes]].",
        "Price": "On average a ''mimir'' cost two thousand [[gold piece]]s, though some considered a smarter option to be simply trading another [[magic item]] for one.",
        "History": "At some point, a group of [[adventurer]]s from the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] came to the city of Sigil, having purchased a [[map]] from a sage in [[Shadowdale]]. When the group's [[fighter]] unfolded the map they began scanning it in search of the gate-town Glorium, only to quickly be corrected by his [[rogue]] ally that town headed to [[Gladsheim]] and they were looking for the gate-town to [[Bytopia]]. Watching the adventurers argue among themselves, a peddler emerged from the shadows with a variety of shaped ''mimirs'' floating about him. He offered a skull-shaped one to the group's fighter, who proceeded to ask it their query and was told what they sought was the gate-town [[Tradegate]]. Impressed, the adventurers paid the peddler for the ''mimir'' and went off on their journey.",
        "Notable Mimirs": "* ''Jay and Silent Bob'': A unique ''mimir'' that was acquired by a group of [[Ravenian]] adventurers in the markets of [[Ribcage]]. It consisted of a pair of objects, known respectively as Jay and Silent Bob. The one called Jay could readily answer most questions related to the [[Planes of Chaos]]. The one called Silent Bob could answer questions about nearly all of the planes, but would do so only rarely and in a cryptic fashion.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Into the Depths|13,38}}",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Fiend]]s often utilized ''mimirs'' in their endless [[Blood War]] to store battle plans, maps of enemy fortifications, espionage reports, and recordings of torture sessions.\n* [[Qaida]], an [[aasimar]] and member of the [[Dustmen]], owned a skull-shaped ''mimir''.<ref>",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Where exactly ''mimirs'' came from or were made was a mystery. Some claim they came from [[chaotic good]] planes, while others believed they were spawned in the pits of [[Baator]]."
