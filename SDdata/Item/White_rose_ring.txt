A white rose ring was an ornamental ring that served as a symbol of distinction in the city of Ravens Bluff during the late 14 century DR. This decoration was awarded posthumously to knights of the Order of the Dove who sacrificed their lives to save that of an innocent. It was a merit that was exclusive to that specific knightly order.
