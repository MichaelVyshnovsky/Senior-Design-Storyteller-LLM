        "History": "This blade was once owned by a servant of the [[deity]] [[Bhaal]], [[Dabber]], who led a cadre of minions. Whenever he returned from battle with even the slightest of injury, Dabber considered it a failure of his subordinate officers. He punished them with regular assaults while wielding ''Adjatha'' until he was fully recovered from his wounds.\n\nAt some point, the [[sword]] came into the possession of the [[cambion]] known as [[Warden (Planar Prison)|the Warden]] of the [[Planar Prison]] that appeared in [[Athkatla]] in the year [[1369 DR]]."
