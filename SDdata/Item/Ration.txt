'''Rations''' were packs of various dry foods that were convenient for extended travels.

==Description==
Typical rations packed an assortment of [[jerky]], dried fruits, [[hard-tack|hardtack]], and nuts, although several other combinations were possible. Each day's worth of meal was packed in waxed parchment and sackcloth and tied with strings to increase durability, which was at least two weeks.

Ration packs containing hard rolls, dried [[cheese]] and fruit, jerky, and tuber vegetables such as [[potato]]es and [[turnip]]s were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Reputation==
Ration packs produced by the inhabitants of [[Arvandor]] were famous for their sweetness.
