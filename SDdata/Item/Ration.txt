Rations were packs of various dry foods that were convenient for extended travels.
Typical rations packed an assortment of jerky, dried fruits, hardtack, and nuts, although several other combinations were possible. Each days worth of meal was packed in waxed parchment and sackcloth and tied with strings to increase durability, which was at least two weeks.
Ration packs containing hard rolls, dried cheese and fruit, jerky, and tuber vegetables such as potatoes and turnips were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Ration packs produced by the inhabitants of Arvandor were famous for their sweetness.
