Saintsblood pearls were small round precious stones that looked like pearls, imbued with restorative magics.
One saintsblood pearl came with fifty charges of its healing magic and was able to cast a set of various spells. Each  spell consumed the different number of charges. Cure critical wounds could be cast at the expenditure of four charges, cure light wounds - one charge, cure moderate wounds - two charges, cure serious wounds - three, and restoration - five.
It was said that saintsblood pearls were droplets of blood that came from those pure of heart who were martyred for their worship. According to the stories, their spilled blood was as pure and white as fresh snow and hardened into these magical stones once exposed to the cold and cruel world. Saintsblood pearls were a way for the deceased saints to give their blessings to the fellow worshipers.
In 1372 DR, a saintsblood pearl could be purchased from the temple of Lathander, Moonglow Tower in Daggerford and another could be found among piles of curios in Torleths Treasures in Gillians Hill.
In 1374 DR, a wizard Vania, the unfortunate love interest of the man only known as the Collector from the Neverwinters Blacklake District, was in possession of one of the saintsblood pearls.
