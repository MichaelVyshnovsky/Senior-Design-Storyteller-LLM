        "mainbody": "eredus the Great was a popular ballad about the life and death of the adventuring hero known as Peredus who perished not far from the city of Daggerford.\nThe ballad birthed some speculations about the place of the heros death and his alleged magical blade that perished alongside its master. This led to the particular passage about the well and Peredus post-mortem fate to be favorite among amateur archeologists.\nIn 1372 DR, the song could be heard in the Happy Cow tavern of Daggerford, performed by Jorey Fontalas. The same year, a shady adventurer named Burnas Tellrot theorized that the well from the ballad was located in the Wild Pastures outside fo the city and sought the aid of Hero of Daggerford in retrieval of the \"Eldritch sword\" that belonged to the folk hero.\nBy the , lyrics and music sheet for Peredus the Great was available in a book, simply titled Sword Coast Songbook, a collection of songs compiled by Silke Rosena sometime before her death in the 14 century DR. Copies of Sword Coast Songbook were found in the city of Baldurs Gate."
