'''''Daemonclaws of Gr'Zak''''' were unique [[enchanted]] bladed [[gauntlet]]s from the ancient [[elf|elven]] city of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Powers==
These fierce bladed gauntlets dramatically boosted the wearer's strength at the cost of their wisdom and imbued them with a ''+3'' defensive enchantment. The gauntlets' claws possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment that caused severe offensive damage and helped guide the fists toward the targets. The wielder also was granted the ability to cast ''[[inflict critical wounds]]'' [[spell]] at will. ''Daemonclaws of Gr'Zak'' held four charges of the spell.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Daemonclaws of Gr'Zak'' were among several powerful artifacts excavated from the [[Elven Catacombs]] of Myth Drannor by the agents of the [[drow]] [[House Freth]]. The gauntlets were locked in heavily trapped chests by the Freth drow and prepared to be shipped back to the [[Underdark]], when a group of heroes â€“ the [[Veiled Ones]], dismantled the drow operations allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
