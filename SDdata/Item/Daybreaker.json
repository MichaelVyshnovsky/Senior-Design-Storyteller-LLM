        "mainbody": "The Daybreaker was an enchanted two-handed bludgeon, used in the late 15 century DR in northwest Faer√ªn.\nThe Daybreaker was enchanted with divine magics to be deadly to the undead. The weapon became effectively an enchanted +4 morningstar when used against undead creatures. In addition to that, it dealt additional radiant damage to its foes.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the Daybreaker was said to be located somewhere in the city of Neverwinter, possibly in the hands of Dazuur and its undead horde in the ruins of Illefarn, or hidden in the hoard of the dragons who terrorized the Dragons Roost in the Sword Mountains."
