'''''Wands of the sun''''' were [[magical item]]s that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the [[Land of Fate]].

==Powers==
These [[wand]]s discharged a golden ray that was up to {{SI|90|ft}}. The effects of the ray were similar to the ''[[sunscorch]]'' spell. The ray never missed its target and blasted it with burning damage. Targets wearing metallic armor or holding metallic weapons suffered more damage.

These wands were favored by powerful members of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]].
