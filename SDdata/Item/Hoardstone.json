        "mainbody": "A hoardstone was a dragon-made enchanted gemstone that increased the value of all valuables around it.\nHoardstones took the form of flawless gemstones worth at least 5,000 gp.\nThe influence of a hoardstone made all objects within  of it gain in quality, ultimately increasing their value by 25%. The process was generally achieved through transmutation of their materials, rendering metals purer, wood finer, and gems clearer, but it also made works of art more intricate or vibrant. Upon removal from the area of effect, objects so altered remained in a superior state for a length of time equal to the one they spent in the influence of the hoardstone itself.\nOnly dragons had the right mindsets to craft hoardstones, being able to grasp the \"spirit\" of what made an object valuable on an instinctual level.\nDwarves prized them."
