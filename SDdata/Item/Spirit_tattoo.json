        "Powers": "These permanent tattoos held magics that improved the recipient's charisma, making them aesthetically pleasing to the eye. However, ''spirit tattoos'' came at the price of painful application. The process slightly but permanently negatively affected the recipient's physique and ability to withstand damage.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Year of Great Change of the Malatran calendar, a group of heroes from the Living Jungle were tasked by [[Bengoukee]] of the [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]], on behalf of [[nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]]s, was sent to a faraway land of [[Faer√ªn]] to retrieve an artifact from a dreaded headshrinker. As a reward, Bengoukee applied a ''spirit tattoo'' on one of the heroes' skin."
