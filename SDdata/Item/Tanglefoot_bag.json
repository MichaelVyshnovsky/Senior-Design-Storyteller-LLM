        "mainbody": "Tanglefoot bags were a means of throwing an alchemical goo to entangle an enemy.\nA tanglefoot bag was usually round and made of leather and weighed about . It was designed in such a way as to open up when thrown to disperse the thick goo inside. The goo hardened rapidly when it came into contact with air, so if it splashed over a creature, it could effectively glue that being to the ground.\nA standard tanglefoot bag contained enough alchemical goo to cover a large creature. If thrown upon a flying creature, it would harden around wings and prevent flight. The goo would not harden underwater it required contact with air.\nThe hardened goo quickly became brittle after as little as a dozen seconds or so and cracked apart. Universal solvent quickly dissolved it.\nSkill in alchemy was required to make a tanglefoot bag. \nTanglefoot bags were typically sold in alchemists shops for around 50 gold pieces.\n* Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch, being a business run by an alchemist, sold tanglefoot bags.\n* Almaes the Alchemists shop in Ashabenford sold tanglefoot bags.\n* Valas Jaelre, a drow wizard, sold tanglefoot bags to other drow in Cormanthor.\n* Tanglefoot bags could also be purchased from the gnomes of Thunderstone.\n* The Howling Wing, a band of kir-lanan, often used tanglefoot bags against flying opponents.\n* The armies of the Nine Hells often used tanglefoot bags against winged angels and archons.\n*Githyanki this militaristic race of creatures from outside of Toril was known to arm their soldiers and captains with several types of thrown weapons, including tanglefoot bags and thunderstones."
