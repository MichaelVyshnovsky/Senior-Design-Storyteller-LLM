        "mainbody": "warfbane was a poison that was especially effective against dwarves.\nDwarfbane was gummy in its consistency.\nThe duergar of the Underdark often coated darts and other weapons with this poison for the use in traps.\nThough the duergar were completely immune to the poison, dwarfbane was lethal to all other dwarves.\nDwafbane was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage, Lethchauntos the Black, during his time spent with an orc tribe. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage, Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists."
