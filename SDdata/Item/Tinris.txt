'''''Tinris''''' ("Glitteredges" in [[Espruar]]) was an ancient, [[enchanted]] [[main-gauche]] that was typically wielded alongside an equally ancient enchanted [[sabre]] known as ''[[Kirquare]]''.{{Cite polyhedron/93/A Fool's Errand: The Viper Comes To Ravens Bluff|20}}

==Description==
''Tinris'' shared a visual design with ''Kirquare''. This included having a blade forged of [[everbright]] [[steel]] and an exquisitely designed basket hilt, with idyllic woodland scenes carved from their quillons down to their pommels. Their grips were covered in a red leather that seemed impervious to stains and wear. And their pommels bore the image of a laughing [[fey]]'s head, with a tongue protruding out to form the hilt and ending wrapped around the blade's base.

==Powers==
''Tinris'' was a ''weapon of skewering'', meaning that it could ignore any ''+1'' or higher protective enchantments on any armor it struck.<ref> It also had a unique ability to deflect [[spell]]s, having them rebound in a random direction, though once that was done once the wielder could not use any of its other powers for over a minute. When wielded alongside ''Kirquare'', the main-gauche took on an effect similar to a ''[[sword of speed]]''.

Wielding ''Tinris'' also enabled one to cast the [[spell]]s ''[[clairaudience]]'' three times per day out to a range of {{SI|20|ft}}, ''[[detect magic]]'' once per minute, ''[[detect evil and good]]'' once per minute, and ''[[teleport]]''. The ''teleport'' could only be cast once per day and the user could only ''teleport'' up to {{SI|600|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==History==
The exact age and creator of ''Tinris'' and ''Kirquare'' were both lost to time. They appeared several times throughout the ages, as far back as the dawn of [[elven]] history. One legend even claimed that the blades were once wielded by [[Eldron Collodae]], an [[avatar]] of [[Erevan Ilesere]], the [[Seldarine|elven god]] of mischief and [[rogue]]s.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the two blades that somehow found their way into the possession of The [[Smiling Viper]], a legendary and enigmatic [[moon elf]] rogue.
