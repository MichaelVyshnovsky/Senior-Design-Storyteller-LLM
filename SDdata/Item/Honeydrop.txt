'''Honeydrops''' were a type of [[honey]]-flavored candy found in [[Faer√ªn]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/Handfoods of the Realms}}

==Description==
Roughly the size of a thumb, these candies consisted of honey mixed with an edible gum and [[spices]]. This combination of ingredients not only provided the candy its flavor, but kept its honey from melting and running in hot conditions.

==Notable Users==
These candies were quite popular in the lands of [[Calimshan]], [[Chessenta]], [[Mulhorand]], the [[Raurin desert]], and the [[Vilhon Reach]].
