Honeydrops were a type of honey-flavored candy found in Faer√ªn.
Roughly the size of a thumb, these candies consisted of honey mixed with an edible gum and spices. This combination of ingredients not only provided the candy its flavor, but kept its honey from melting and running in hot conditions.
These candies were quite popular in the lands of Calimshan, Chessenta, Mulhorand, the Raurin desert, and the Vilhon Reach.
