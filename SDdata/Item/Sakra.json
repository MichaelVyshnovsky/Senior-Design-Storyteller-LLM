        "mainbody": "akra was a spicy gravy popular in Delzimmer. There was a basic recipe, but most cooks freely added their own touches.  Sometimes strong alcohol was added, either secretly or as a featured ingredient, so sakra could be just as intoxicating as some beverages.\nSakra was make by boiling down the blood and organs of cows, pigs, or other beasts. Quace root was added for color and as a thickening agent. Mushrooms and braskh were also featured ingredients, the braskh being the primary source for the spicy heat. The final result was thick, brown, and lumpy, typically served over meat pies, skewered meats, and other main entrees for an evening meal."
