'''''Recorder stones''''', were a variety of [[enchanted]] [[gem]]s unique to the [[Society of Sensation]] planar faction of [[Sigil]].

{{Quote|We collect memories here at the [[Civic Festhall]]. We buy them from the citizens of [[Sigil]], from the peoples of a hundred strange worlds, from the endless stream of planewalkers who pass through our city between exploits. We store them in enchanted ''recorder stones'', so that we&mdash;and any who desire&mdash;may know experiences the like of which were never dreamed possible.|A [[Sensate]] in the Civic Festhall.}}

==Description==
These stones were small, round in shape, and made of many semiprecious minerals.

==Powers==
''Recorder stones'' allowed people to encode or "record" upon them their experiences, in the form of single or set of sensations. It usually took about an hour to record an experience, though long or complex ones could take an entire day to encode. 

Once an experience was encoded upon a ''recorder stone'', it could be accessed and experienced by anyone just by activating the stone, which required physically touching the stone and focus one's thoughts, though it was possible to enchant a ''recorder stone'' to only provide access to a specific user. Once a stone was activated, its user would lose all sense of reality and become engulfed in the sensation(s) of the stone.

Generally, whenever a ''recorder stone'' was removed from the sensoriums of the Civic Festhall, they would revert to unenchanted rock. Though there were some exceptions to this. In addition, it was possible to become addicted to the experiences provided by ''recorder stones''.

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Ayryn Farlight]] held a ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' session for select members of the Society of Sensation, using her sorcerous gift to observe and record activities of various deities of Toril on to ''recorder stones''. When she attempted to ''scry'' the goddess of luck [[Tymora]]. Her magic sight was redirected by the goddess to observing [[Jasmine]] and [[Joel]] of [[Finder Wyvernspur]]'s Band. Eventually, her sight was focused on [[Milil]] who was delighted to have an audience. The deity used magic to affix the scrying and performed the following songs: ''[[the Baker's Daughter]]'', a jaunty [[hin]] tune - ''[[Pipeweed Dreams]]'', a lengthy ballad - ''[[the Seven Sisters (ballad)|the Seven Sisters]]'', followed by ''[[Three Thayvian Roses]]'', ''[[the Purple Dragons of Cormyr (ballad)|the Purple Dragons of Cormyr]]'', and a number of Faerunian folk songs about such mundane things as milking [[cow]]s, weather, and crops. Eventually, the Sensates started getting bored of the performance, to what Milil responded by starting to sing an [[opera]] - ''[[the Fall of Myth Drannor (opera)|the Fall of Myth Drannor]]''. The long and torturous performance was a punishment for trying to record activities of gods. The entirety of this event, like all scrying gatherings of the Sensates, was ultimately encoded upon ''recorder stones''.

==Notable Users==
===Groups===
* The '''Society of Sensation''' had millions of ''sensory stones'' stored away within their Civic Festhall on Sigil, containing experiences from people all across the [[plane]]s, including those of [[deva]]s, [[human]]s, [[fiend]]s, and [[tiefling]]s. Entry into their faction required contributing five worthwhile experiences to ''recorder stones'', each focusing on a different sense, or one substantial experience that featured all five senses to some extent.<ref> They were also willing to pay 500 [[gold piece]]s for any sensations not already in their collection, especially anything they could use against the [[Fated]] and their factol, Duke [[Rowan Darkwood]]. These and all other ''recorder stones'' were kept within two grand halls of the Civic Festhall&mdash;the Sensate Sensorium, which was only accessible to members, and the Public Sensorium, which was open to the public. In the latter, individuals or groups could pay a fee of 100 gold pieces to partake in a specific sensation or experience, three times per day for up to four hours each.

===Individuals===
* [[Fall-From-Grace]], a [[succubus]] and Sensate in the city of Sigil, operated a brothel that provided its working women ''sensory stones'' for use as diaries. These stones were all kept in one room and attuned to their individual users, making it impossible for others to access the experiences that they contained.
* The [[Nameless One]], an amnesiac immortal being, used the Civic Festhall's ''sensory stones'' to help him rediscover his forgotten memories.
* [[Phineas]], a member of the Society of Sensation, traveled to the city of [[Samargol]] on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime world]] of [[Toril]] in [[1374 DR]] in search of exotic resources. When a group of [[adventurer]]s managed to achieve all the resources he was after, Phineas gifted them the Namless One's ''sensory stone'', having somehow not lost its enchantment despite its removal from the Civic Festhall.
