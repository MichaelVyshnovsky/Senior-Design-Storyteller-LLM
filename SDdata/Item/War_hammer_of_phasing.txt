War hammers of phasing were enchanted one-handed warhammers that were dangerous due to the magic and their sheer bone-crushing weight.
These warhammers appeared to be ordinary weapons made of steel with  hafts.
War hammers of phasing could be created with two enchantment strengths +2 and +3. Additionally, upon a successful strike, these hammers had a chance of dealing magical cold damage or phasing the targets for ten seconds. The phased targets received damage as long as the effects of the magic remained active.
1281 DR, the leader of frost giants of the Wyrms Tooth glacier on the Spine of the World, Joril Frostbeard owned a warhammer of phasing of +2 enchantment. During the same year, a blind dwarven smith Tiernon Denthelm of the Gloomfrost ice caverns offered one of these hammers with a +3 enchantment for purchase.
