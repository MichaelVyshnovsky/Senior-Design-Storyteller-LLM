        "mainbody": "A '''glaur''' was a short curved valved [[horn]], popular among [[bard]]s in the [[Realms]]. It was similar to a cornucopia and sounded like a [[trumpet]].",
        "Description": "The glaur was a more versatile instrument than other trumpets. Its sound was brash and metallic. Glaurs made of brass, silver and electrum were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.\n\nA variant of the glaur without the valves was called a [[gloon]] and had a more mournful sound.",
        "Notable Glaurs": "* Following the [[Spellplague]], there was known to exist in the Realms a legendary glaur from [[Elturgard]] that was valved and plated in electrum. It had a unique curvature to it that produced a brash, metallic roar that was unlike any other glaur. Legends claimed that it had once been blown by the god [[Torm]].",
