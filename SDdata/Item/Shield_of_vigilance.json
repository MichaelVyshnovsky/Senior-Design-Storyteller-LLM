        "mainbody": "A '''''shield of vigilance''''' was a large [[magic]]al steel shield adorned with a symbol of [[Torm]]. The wielder of a ''shield of vigilance'' could sheath it in electricity, causing injury to foes bashed with the shield. Although a relatively common magical item, it was worth around 9000 gold pieces. A more powerful version of ''shield of vigilance'' was rumored to exist, able to reflect all electricity."
