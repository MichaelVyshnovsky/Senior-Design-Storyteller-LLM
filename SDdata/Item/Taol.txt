A '''taol''' or '''toal''' (either name was correct) was a [[Waterdhavian]] coin worth two [[gold|gold pieces]] in the city, but outside Waterdeep these coins were practically worthless.

==Description==
The toal was a square [[brass]] coin with a hole in the center to allow it to be strung on a string.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], taols could be exchanged for other currency in the [[Palace of Waterdeep]] with no exchange fee, but the line was so long that appointments frequently needed to be made a day in advance. The [[Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters]] and the [[Jewelers' Guild]] were also capable of quickly and reliably performing the exchange.
