The '''''girdle of Labelas''''' was an enchanted [[belt]] created by the [[avatar]] of [[Labelas Enoreth]] to be worn by High Priests of the [[Church of Labelas Enoreth]].

==Description==
The belt was crafted using alternating bands of [[bronze]] and [[gold]].

==Powers==
When worn, the ''girdle of Labelas'' allowed the use of the ''[[haste]]'' spell once per day. Additionally, the wearer was unrestrained by difficult terrains or magical obstacles such as ''[[web]]'' and ''[[entangle]]'' spells.

==History==
The ''girdle of Labelas'' was created by the avatar of Labelas Enoreth in [[Myth Glaurach]]'s [[Star Mausoleum]], before the {{YearlinkName|864}}, then the [[elf|elven]] city fell under an [[orc|orcish]] onslaught. Before the city's sacking at the hands of the horde, the ''girdle of Labelas'' was worn by Labelasan High Priests during their daily activities and into battle.

By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the long-lost and stolen ''girdle of Gond'' came to be owned by [[Orrick]] the Gray, a [[wizard]] who lived on the edge of Kuldahar and dedicated his life to the study of ''[[mythal]]s''. He offered the enchanted girdle to those who were willing to recover ancient tomes of ''mythal'' magic from the [[Severed Hand]] citadel on the [[Spine of the World]].
