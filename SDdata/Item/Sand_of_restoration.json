        "Powers": "If sprinkled on the damaged stones and framework of a building or other man-made structure, ''sand of restoration'' would temporarily repair all cracks, gaps, etc. on the surface of the building that the sand touched. All previously damaged sections were replaced with translucent sand that lasted for 12 hours before reverting to their previous state. A handful of ''sand of restoration'' could repair 50 cubic feet (15 cubic meters).\n\nBuildings repaired in this manner could be used to shelter from the elements, but even the slightest physical damage to the structure from outside sources would cause it to collapse."
