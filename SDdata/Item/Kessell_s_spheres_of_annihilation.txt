Kessells spheres of annihilation was an artifact created by the undead Akar Kessell, who used the power of the black ice to spread corruption across Icewind Dale.
Kessells spheres of annihilation were deadly weapons, forged with the magical power of Crenshinibon. When wielded in battle, this device generated eight weaker spheres of annihilation that were forcefully jettisoned in opposite directions, repelled from each other, damaging everything and everyone in their way. Each consecutive damage done by a sphere weakened it, making the next damage weaker and, eventually, snuffing the spheres of annihilation out.
Akar Kessell forged this artifact sometime circa the , during the black ice crisis in Icewind Dale.
