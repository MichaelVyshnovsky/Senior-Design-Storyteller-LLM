'''''Kessell's spheres of annihilation''''' was an [[artifact]] created by the [[undead]] [[Akar Kessell]], who used the power of the ''[[black ice]]'' to spread corruption across [[Icewind Dale]].

==Powers==
''Kessell's spheres of annihilation'' were deadly weapons, forged with the magical power of ''[[Crenshinibon]]''. When wielded in battle, this device generated eight weaker ''[[spheres of annihilation]]'' that were forcefully jettisoned in opposite directions, repelled from each other, damaging everything and everyone in their way. Each consecutive damage done by a ''sphere'' weakened it, making the next damage weaker and, eventually, snuffing the ''spheres of annihilation'' out.

==History==
Akar Kessell forged this artifact sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, during the ''black ice'' crisis in Icewind Dale.
