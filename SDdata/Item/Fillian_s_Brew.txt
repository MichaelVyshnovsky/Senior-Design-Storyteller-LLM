The strange and unusual '''Fillian's Brew''' was one of the strongest alcoholic concoctions in [[Daggerford]], lovingly named the ''' Bitch Queen's Revenge''' by the local sailors.
{{quote|''I guarantee you'll be wanting to take [[Umberlee]]'s name in vain after having some of Fillian's Best! Interested?''|[[Fillian]].}}

==Description==
Extremely potent, Fillian's Brew was brewed using a special blend of [[hops]], [[barley]], and sixty-four other secret ingredients.

==History==
Fillian's Best could be purchased in the [[River Quarter]] of Daggerford ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]. It was sold by an eccentric [[gnome]] brewer named Fillian. The advertisement claiming the drink was strong enough to knock a [[stone giant]] out and put hair on an [[elf]]'s chest was possibly a bit exaggerated.
