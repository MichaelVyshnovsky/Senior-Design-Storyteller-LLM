The strange and unusual Fillians Brew was one of the strongest alcoholic concoctions in Daggerford, lovingly named the  Bitch Queens Revenge by the local sailors.
Extremely potent, Fillians Brew was brewed using a special blend of hops, barley, and sixty-four other secret ingredients.
Fillians Best could be purchased in the River Quarter of Daggerford circa 1372 DR. It was sold by an eccentric gnome brewer named Fillian. The advertisement claiming the drink was strong enough to knock a stone giant out and put hair on an elfs chest was possibly a bit exaggerated.
