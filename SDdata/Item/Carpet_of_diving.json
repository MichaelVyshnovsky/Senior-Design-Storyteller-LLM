        "mainbody": "Carpets of diving were cursed magic items that originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nA carpet of diving measured  wide by  long and could carry three people.\nThese carpets behaved just like other carpets of flying, assuming they never flew higher than  above the ground. At an altitude of 200 ft. or higher, the carpet stalled and then dove straight for the ground. Any riders unable to fly or slow their descent by other means usually died upon impact with the ground."
