A '''''wand of defoliation''''' was a [[magic]]al [[wand]].

==Description==
Unlike typical wands or [[staves]], these were never made of wood. Bone or ivory were usually used to make the bases instead.

==Powers==
Such wands had two functions. With a single charge, they would destroy all chlorophyll within a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} radius. All grass would become very dry and brown in color. If two charges were expended, trees and other plant life within the {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} range would instantly die. Sentient plant life would not automatically be killed, but would suffer moderate damage. The user of the wand could instead concentrate the power into a tight cone, causing extremely high damage to the plant creatures within.{{Cite document/Curse of the Azure Bonds/Clue Book|43}} and [[vegepygmies]].
