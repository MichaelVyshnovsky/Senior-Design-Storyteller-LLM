'''''Cloak of many fashions''''' was a magical cloak.

==Powers==
An individual could change the color, quality and style of this cloak. For the transformation to function, the cloak had to be worn by the individual. Despite changing appearances, the weight of the cloak remained unchanged. An individual could not transform the cloak into another item of clothing. While the cloak could duplicate the appearance of another magical cloak, it did not inherit any magical properties of said cloak.
