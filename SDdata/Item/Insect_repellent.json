        "mainbody": "Insect repellent, also known as parasite repellent, was a class of substances designed to protect the user from the bites of insects and parasites.\nBoth natural and alchemical or otherwise magical insect repellents existed, and they came in many forms with somewhat different use cases.\nInsect-repelling incense could be used to ward off all normal bugs within a radius of . When lit, a block of such incense would burn for up to eight hours. Such incense sold for 1 silver piece per block as of the late 15 century DR.\nAlchemists were said to manufacture a strong smelling liquid that was applied to the skin. It worked to repel normal and smaller insects for up to four hours and could even dissuade giant insects or insects under the influence of spells from attacking the wearer. Such substances were sold for 5 gold pieces per dose as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR. \nIt was said that certain magical fluids could be sprayed to prevent any insect from approaching the user. Containers of such fluids could sell for 1,000 gold pieces as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nPowdered insect repellents were said to be an alchemical substance that warded off any insects in much the same way that similar magical substances might ward off lycanthropes or undead, although the effect usually only lasted up to 20 minutes. These were produced from ingredients derived from natural flowers including daisies and jasmine. Such powders sold for 200 gold pieces as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nInsect repelling salves were applied to the skin and generally protected only against normal insects. They tended to be ineffective against giant insects or against angry swarms, or to help prevent the contraction of diseases from them. \nNonmagical salves tended to be greasy as a result of being water resistant, and could be either odorless or quite pungent. Such salves were sold in vials, jars, or gourds containing enough for between 3 and 20 days of protection, and sold for 1 gold piece per 20 doses as of the late 15 century DR.\nA magical version of insect repelling salve These magical salves sold for as much as 1,000 gold pieces as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAngelicas could serve as a mild insect repellent. The juice of magasoriums and the oil derived from bison-gourds could be utilized as effective insect repellents.\nGarlic juice was said to be a natural insect repellent, although its strong smell made it easy to tell when a user of it was coming. Garlic could also be used to soothe venomous insect bites.\nChultan dwarves were known to cover themselves in grease to ward off insects.\nIn the Othrys layer of Carceri, stinkweed was commonly rubbed on bodies to ward off insects. \nThe Azuposi people of Maztica used the black cohosh plant as a natural \"bugbane\".\nThere also existed a repel insects spell that achieved a similar effect as repellent substances.\nFolk in the Moonsea region made use of an insect repellent that came in the form of a pungent yellow goop. \nAs of the late 15 century DR, explorers in Chult were advised to use insect repellent to avoid contracting shivering sickness. The market for insect repellent was strictly regulated in Port Nyanzaru&mdashthe only city in Chult at the time&mdashwith the sale and production of such repellents being controlled by the merchant prince Kwayoth√©. Both salves and incense could be bought at the citys Red Bazaar."
