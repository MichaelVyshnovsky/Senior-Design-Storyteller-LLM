A '''''wand of color''''' was a [[magic]]al [[wand]] that allowed the user to change the color of any bolt of cloth or garment, as per the [[alteration]] [[spell]], ''[[color]]''.

==Description==
This type of wand was crafted in the shape of a finely made painter's brush. It was made with ease-of-use in mind and could be recharged quite simply, with a single casting of the spell ''color''.
