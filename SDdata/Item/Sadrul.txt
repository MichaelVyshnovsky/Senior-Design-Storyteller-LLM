'''''Sadrul''''' was a [[sword]] belonging to the [[elven]] forager [[Feraih]]. After her death, it was bequeathed upon [[Kiril Duskmourn]] in {{yearlink|1374}}. It bore a minor enchantment.

==Powers==
Per [[Essam]], the sword bore a minor enchantment, and it was the sharpest in all of [[Al Qahera]].{{cite book/Darkvision|260-262|27}}

==History==
''Sadrul'' originally belonged to [[Feraih]]. After she returned from the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]], some curse she carried with her slew her, even though she'd done nothing other than look at it from outside; [[Essam]] gave her sword to [[Kiril Duskmourn]], who was headed for the same palace, so that she may avenge Feraih if she came across the source of the curse.

==Trivia==
Per Essam, the sword was so sharp that [[Feraih]] once used it to part a man's dignity from his self-esteem (this was a joke).{{cite book/Darkvision|210-211|22}}
