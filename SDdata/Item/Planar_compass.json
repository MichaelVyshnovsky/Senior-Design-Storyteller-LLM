        "mainbody": "lanar compasses were magical navigational tools that pointed in the direction of the nearest way to a particular plane, allowing users to locate interplanar gates.\nDespite their name, these devices did not resemble mundane compasses, but rather were iron spheres measuring  in diameter. They were designed to be easily separated into two halves, revealing a hollow cavity that measured  in diameter, and equally rejoined with ease.\nAfter placing an object within the hollow cavity of a planar compass and rejoining its two halves, the instrument would proceed to spin around until eventually stopping, with a small arrow jutting out from one of its halves. This arrow pointed towards the direction of the nearest pathway to the plane from which the item originated, whether it be a gate, astral conduit, or elemental vortex. This effect remained active, the planar compass pointing unerringly, until either the device entered the planar destination or the object placed within it was removed.\nAround the late 14 century DR, a number of adventurers from Ravens Bluff came into possession of planar compasses. One of the first was a group tasked by either Alcides Von Tighe or Simon Regulus with delivering a planar compass, secured within a magical lockbox, to the githzerai sage ARinthorm as a substance held within it would aid in the sages studies. Much later, another group had a compass offered to them in return for 5,000 gold pieces by Bob and Susan Nuhard, proprietors of the Gates of Hell Inn in the city of Dis. And finally, a group of adventurers were loaned a planar compass by the ruvkova Kharn after providing him positive energy, promising it would help lead them to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum."
