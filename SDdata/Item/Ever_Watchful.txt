Ever Watchful, later known as Vindicator, was the favored weapon of Helm, the deity of guardians and protectors.
Ever Watchful was a mighty bastard sword that Helm preferred to wield two-handed. The sword had the symbol of Helm (a watchful eye with a blue pupil emblazoned on an upright gauntlet) on its hilt. It glowed with silvery flame, and anyone unworthy of wielding it felt a burning sensation when they grasped it.
In the hands of Helms avatar, the weapon was an incredibly powerful keen bastard sword that was both holy and lawful. It therefore struck hardest against evil and chaotic foes, and such creatures would be weakened should they touch the sword.Ever Watchful was a +4 holy keen lawful bastard sword in Faiths and Pantheons, and was given as a +3 bastard sword in the earlier Faiths & Avatars. It had no formal statistics in 4th edition.
Among mortals who were deemed worthy to wield it, Ever Watchful could be recalled to their hands regardless of where it was. These individuals also had the ability to wreathe themselves in an armor of faith that manifested as luminous grey plate mail. The grey color of both the armor and the swords flames were said to represent the lawful neutral ideology of Helms justice neither evil (black) nor good (white).
While Helm had wielded many weapons, Ever Watchful was his preference.
In the , Helm was killed in an honor-duel with Tyr. His sword, now more often referred to as "Vindicator," arrived on Faer√ªn that same year in the hands of Gedrin Thalvar after he had a vision of the gods death. Gedrin would go on to wield the blade in the name of justice as a vigilante called "Shadowbane."
Many years later, Gedrin gave the sword to Kalen Dren, who took up Gedrins Shadowbane mantle and carried the sword
