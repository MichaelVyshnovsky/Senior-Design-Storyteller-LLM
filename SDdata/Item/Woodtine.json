        "Description": "This brownish and fibrous [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] was found in large nodules and was cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]]. The name of this stone was a corruption of the odd term \"wood tin\", applied colloquially to this gemstone. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.",
        "Powers": "This gemstone could be used as \"residual magic\" detector, more sensitive than ''[[detect magic]]'' and other similar spells. When woodtine was brought into contact with another [[gem]], stone, or metal, it would darken in color if that item had been previously enchanted and had since released its magical energies. The color change was temporary and repeatable."
