        "mainbody": "Moonhoney was made from the feces of ground-dwelling worms that dwelt in the Abyss.\nIts color and consistency resembled that of honey, but with a smoky taste. When exposed to moonlight, it developed a temporary sweet flavor that was highly prized by humans and many demihumans. Moonhoney didnt spoil so it was ideal travel food. When swallowed, it would cure any poison in a persons system."
