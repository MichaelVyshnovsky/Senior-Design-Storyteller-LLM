A ring of mind shielding was a magic item designed to literally shield the mind of the wearer from unwanted magical intrusion.
Many of these rings were finely crafted with precious materials, making them quite valuable.
The creation process for one of these rings involved casting a nondetection spell.
Rings of mind shielding were more common among those whose dealings often involved the need for such protective magic including nobles, rebels, shopkeepers with magical inventory, and members of the arcane black market.
