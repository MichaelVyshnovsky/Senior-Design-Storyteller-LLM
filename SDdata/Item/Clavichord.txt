A '''clavichord''' was a large keyboard instrument.

==Description==
These instruments were rather flat boxes of rectangular or oblong shape, measuring {{SI|1|ft}} wide and a little over {{SI|3|ft}} long. Their keyboard design was similar to that of their close relative the [[pipe organ]], but in place of pipes they had horizontal metal strings
===Sound===
Clavichords expressed soft and silvery tones, with the pitch varying depending upon how much force was struck upon the keys. They couldn't reach particularly loud volumes, being quieter than harpsichords.

==Notable Users==
Clavichords were often most appreciated by human communities<ref> and were a popular showpiece in merchant homes.
* The [[Bendekar's Mercantile]] storehouse in [[Ravens Bluff]] had a clavichord in their instruments collection.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/98/A Handful of Dust|16}}
