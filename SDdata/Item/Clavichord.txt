A clavichord was a large keyboard instrument.
These instruments were rather flat boxes of rectangular or oblong shape, measuring  wide and a little over  long. Their keyboard design was similar to that of their close relative the pipe organ, but in place of pipes they had horizontal metal strings
Clavichords expressed soft and silvery tones, with the pitch varying depending upon how much force was struck upon the keys. They couldnt reach particularly loud volumes, being quieter than harpsichords.
Clavichords were often most appreciated by human communities and were a popular showpiece in merchant homes.
* The Bendekars Mercantile storehouse in Ravens Bluff had a clavichord in their instruments collection.
