A pearly white ioun stone was a type of ioun stone that offered gradual healing properties.
It was said that this type of ioun stones were created using the soul of a dead troll.
When a pearly white ioun stone was used by an individual it regenerated their wounds over a lengthy period of time.
One of these ioun stones was hidden away within the abandoned temple of Amaunator in the Umar Hills.
The halfling fence Waizahb was in the possession of one during the time she traveled with the Coalition army.
