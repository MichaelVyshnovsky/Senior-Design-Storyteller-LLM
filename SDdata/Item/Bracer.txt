A bracer was a piece of armor that protected the wrist and forearm. Bracers most often came in pairs, and magical ones usually only imparted their power when both were worn.
Materials that made up bracers tended to vary, from leather to metal to truesilver. They were not only used as armor but also as weapons, as some bracers were modified to have claws.
Bracers were often enchanted, mostly to provide protection or to improve skill at tasks requiring great dexterity, such as archery.
Some rare and wondrous magical bracers were able to function alone, such as Jarlaxles bracer of flying daggers.
