This caused the paper bird to magically fold and seal itself and to take flight, taking the most direct route toward the recipient at a top speed of . Upon arrival at the proximity of its intended recipient, the enchantment wore off and the paper bird became a regular piece of parchment.\nPaper birds were usually found in small boxes containing between 4 and 9 units.\nTo prevent the message from being seen by anyone other than the intended recipient, a paper bird had a number of security measures in place. It could only be unfolded by the intended recipient. Moreover, if a paper bird were intercepted during flight and was prevented from moving, it immediately turned into ash. If the sender and recipient were in different planes of existence by the time the recipients name was whispered, the paper bird also turned into ash.\nPaper birds were a commonly used means of communication in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR. They were employed by numerous guilds and factions, such as the Zhentarim."
