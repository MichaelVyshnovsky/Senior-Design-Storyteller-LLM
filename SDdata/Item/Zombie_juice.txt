'''Zombie juice''' was a foul-tasting disgusting concoction that went down hard but made everything else less painful in comparison.

==Powers==
However unpalatable these drinks were, they increased imbibers' resistance to all harm, mundane and magical.

==History==
In the mid-to-late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], these horrific drinks became available during the extended celebration of [[Liar's Night]], extended into grand [[Masquerade of Liars]] by the order of Lord Neverember.
