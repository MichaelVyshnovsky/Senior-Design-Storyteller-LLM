        "mainbody": "A cursed berserking sword was a sword that bore a curse that sent its wielder into a bloodthirsty frenzy during the heat of battle.\nCursed berserking swords could come in the form of longswords, broadswords, short swords, bastard swords, or two-handed swords. Upon examination, the sword appeared to be a normal yet potent magic sword.\nA cursed berserking sword bore a mighty enchantment that made it tempting to wield, however when the blade was drawn in battle, it affixed itself into the wielders hand and sent them into a blind battle rage. They were driven to fight and kill whatever creature or person was closest to them, only stopping once they themselves were slain or if nothing else was left alive within .\nEven after this berserk state had passed, the curse rendered the wielder unable to relinquish the sword. A wielder could only be freed of the sword with the use of an exorcise, remove curse, or wish spell.\nCursed berserking swords could be found in both Faer√ªn and Zakhara.\nIt was rumored that the natural gem magic of diamonds could protect someone from the mind-influencing effects of a cursed berserking sword.\n* Enduval, which came to rest in the Pyramid of Amun-Re as of the mid&ndash14 century DR.\n* Helmspitter, a massive and sentient two-handed sword that came to rest in the horde of Storm, a young red dragon in the North.\n* One of the bandit kings of the Chieftains in Gold wielded a cursed berserking longsword, which earned him a warlike reputation. Upon his death, the blade was interred with him in the Tombs of Deckon Thar."
