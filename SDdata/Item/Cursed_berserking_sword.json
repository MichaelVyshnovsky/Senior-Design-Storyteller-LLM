        "mainbody": "A '''''cursed berserking sword''''' was a [[sword]] that bore a [[curse]] that sent its wielder into a bloodthirsty frenzy during the heat of battle.",
        "Description": "''Cursed berserking swords'' could come in the form of [[longsword]]s, [[broadsword]]s, [[short sword]]s, [[bastard sword]]s, or [[two-handed sword]]s. Upon examination, the sword appeared to be a normal yet potent [[magic]] sword.",
        "Powers": "A ''cursed berserking sword'' bore a mighty enchantment that made it tempting to wield, however when the blade was drawn in battle, it affixed itself into the wielder's hand and sent them into a blind battle rage. They were driven to fight and kill whatever creature or person was closest to them, only stopping once they themselves were slain or if nothing else was left alive within {{SI|60|feet|long=yes}}.\n\nEven after this berserk state had passed, the curse rendered the wielder unable to relinquish the sword. A wielder could only be freed of the sword with the use of an ''[[exorcise]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', or ''[[wish]]'' spell.",
        "Reputation": "''Cursed berserking swords'' could be found in both [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Zakhara]].\n\nIt was rumored that the natural [[gem magic]] of [[diamond]]s could protect someone from the mind-influencing effects of a ''cursed berserking sword''.{{Cite dragon/83/The many facets of gems|13}}",
        "Notable Cursed Berserking Swords": "* ''[[Enduval]]'', which came to rest in the [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]] as of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n* ''[[Helmspitter]]'', a massive and [[sentient]] two-handed sword that came to rest in the horde of [[Storm (red dragon)|Storm]], a young [[red dragon]] in [[the North]].{{Cite dungeon/43/Into The Silver Realm|59}}\n* One of the bandit kings of the [[Chieftains in Gold]] wielded a ''cursed berserking longsword'', which earned him a warlike reputation. Upon his death, the blade was interred with him in the [[Tombs of Deckon Thar]]."
