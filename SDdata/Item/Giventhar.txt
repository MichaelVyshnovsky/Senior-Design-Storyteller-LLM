Giventhar was a bastard sword crafted on the Astral Plane. 
The blade once once in the possession of a Githyanki lord, who was quite skilled with its use. An adventurer from the Prime Material plane defeated the lord in battle, took the sword and brought it to his home plane of existence. Gith allies pursued the adventurer and after a great battle mortally wounded him. It was rumored the sword was then recovered by the Dalesman wizard Shraevyn, though no sign of it existed in his tomb or among the riches he left in his will.
