        "mainbody": "Deep Dark Red was the name given to a set of enchanted heavy armor that once belonged to Leustrarax of the Bear-Tooth tribe sometime before 1372 DR.\nThis heavy set of armor was enchanted to improve the wearers constitution and wisdom and made them appear terrifying to others, making intimidation easier. The armors main purpose, however, was the magic that allowed the wearer to see in the dark as if by the darkvision spell.\nSometime before 1372 DR, Leustrarax, a shaman of the Bear-Tooth tribe, pulled Deep Dark Red off the body of a knight who attempted to expand his fiefdom into the tribes territory. Shortly after the knights failed invasion, a rival tribe of the Bloody Tusk orcs attacked the Bear-Tooth tribe. The tribes fought fiercely until the Bear-Tooth tribe gained the upper hand and pushed the Bloody Tusks into a large cave. Leustrarax wore the Deep Dark Red armor that allowed him to see in the dark. He delved into the cave from whence the orcs came, found their chieftain, and put an end to his life with a single poisoned arrow.\nMany years later, Deep Dark Red was lost in an unsuccessful Bear-Tooth tribe raid on a well-guarded merchant caravan that moved south. By 1372 DR, the enchanted set of armor ended up in possession of Jonas Maxillian Senior, an apple farmer and a secret werewolf of the Western Farmlands of Daggerford."
