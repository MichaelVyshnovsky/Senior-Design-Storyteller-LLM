'''Focus''' was a potion that significantly improved the ability to concentrate.{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|85}}

==Description==
Focus was a natural substance made by steeping [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] bark and a secret mixture of [[herb]]s in water. The recipe belonged to the [[sorceress]] and [[alchemist]] [[Angrath Dree]] and was one of her most popular elixirs. It could be purchased from her at [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]] in [[Red Larch]], or possibly from secondary vendors elsewhere. The usual price for a single dose was 30 [[gp]].

==Powers==
The effects of focus lasted ten minutes. During that time, the imbiber was more likely to succeed at tasks that required intense concentration.
