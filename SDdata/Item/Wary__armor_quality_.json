        "mainbody": "Wary was an item enchantment that could be applied to an armor or shield.\nWary armors and shields generally had no visual features worth noting.\nPowerful rogues had an ability to prevent people from flanking them, thanks to their great awareness and ability to react. Only people with considerably more skill as a rogue could flank them, and the wary armor quality made it even harder.\nCreating a wary suit of armor or a wary shield required the casting of a cats grace spell."
