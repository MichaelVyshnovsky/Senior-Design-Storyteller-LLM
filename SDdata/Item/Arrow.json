        "mainbody": "Arrows were a type of projectile shot by bows. A normal arrow consisted of a wooden shaft with a metal arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other. Arrows could also be made from stone, bone, horn, and more exotic materials.\nSome arrows were enchanted in some way so they could deal larger damage, dispel, blind or silence their target.\nProjectiles launched from a crossbow were known as bolts, while ballistae launched similar, but much larger missiles.\nEkaa arrow An Iulutiun hunting arrow carved from antler and bone.\nFlight arrow A long, light arrow designed for distance.\nPlay arrow Arrows that were designed for children to play with. Rather than having an arrowhead meant to inflict grievous injury, these were affixed with bean bags.\nSea arrow An arrow made by sea elves for underwater use.\nSheaf arrow A heavy arrow designed for maximum lethality at shorter ranges.\nSignal arrow An arrow that emulated a birds call when shot.\nTrukaa arrow A blunt Iulutiun hunting arrow used for small game.\n* Acid arrow\n* Arrows of biting\n* Arrows of detonation\n* Arrows of dire flatulence\n* Arrows of dispelling\n* Arrows of petrification\n* Arrows of second death\n* Arrows of slaying\n* Arrows of the vampire\n* Elfshots\n* Fire arrows\n* Holdfast arrows\n* Ice arrows\n* Kerrenderit arrows\n* Lightning arrows\n* Translocation arrows\n* Unbreakable arrows"
