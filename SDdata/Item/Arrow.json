        "mainbody": "'''Arrows''' were a type of projectile shot by [[bow]]s. A normal arrow consisted of a wooden shaft with a metal arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other. Arrows could also be made from stone, bone, horn, and more exotic materials.\n\nSome arrows were enchanted in some way so they could deal larger damage, dispel, blind or silence their target.\n\nProjectiles launched from a [[crossbow]] were known as [[bolt]]s, while [[ballista]]e launched similar, but much larger missiles.",
