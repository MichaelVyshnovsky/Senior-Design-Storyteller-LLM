The Tyrs Justice was an enchanted greatsword wielded by Nayeli Goldflower in the late 15 century DR.
Nayelis most prized blade was crafted out of devil-tainted gold and encrusted with gemstones.
Apart from being a fierce enchanted blade, Tyrs Justice allowed the wielder to cast the searing smite spell on one enemy at a time.
Following the death of Maldwyn Daggerford in 1485 DR, Nayeli Goldflower, the member of the Guardians of Daggerford, commissioned the creation of Tyrs Justice out of devil-tainted gold and gems that were on Duke Daggerford body during his assassination. The jewelry was melted and fashioned into the hilt of the blade that was to become Nayelis instrument of vengeance.
