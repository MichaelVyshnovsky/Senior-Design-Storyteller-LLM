        "Powers": "The staff was distinguished from other staves by the carvings of birds that covered it. The bird-calls created by the staff could be heard for a distance up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. The wielder was able to choose which bird call to mimic. The birds the staff could mimic were a [[chicken]], [[crow]], [[duck]], [[eagle]], [[finch]], [[goose]], loon, [[owl]], [[turkey]], or [[seagull]]. The staff held ten charges, and these charges were recharged daily at dawn. When the last charge was used, there was a chance the staff could erupt into a cloud of feathers."
