        "mainbody": "Scale armor was a type of armor used on Toril.\nPlate mail consisted of a leather coat, leggings and sometimes skirt which was covered in small plates of overlapping scales. The finished armor would often resemble the scales of a fish. Although steel was commonly used to make scale mail, actual animal scales (like dragon scales) could be used. Although heavy, the flexibility and adjust-ability of scale mail armor made it surprisingly easy to wear.\nCoin Armor A rare form of scale armor made with over a thousand coins. They were typically seen in use by high-ranking generals and dignitaries.\nSea elven scale mail An expensive form of scale armor that was unique to the sea elves.\n* Painteachers, a variety of specialty priest of the Church of Loviatar, generally wore scale mail in emulation of their goddess.\n* Scalemail was the only type of armor that worshipers of Sseth were known to wear. These were fashioned to resemble the scales of snakes and tinted in a pattern common to one of Faeruns many serpent species."
