A '''''necklace of protection against charm''''' was an [[enchanted]] piece of jewelry that shielded the wearer from [[charm]] [[magic]].

==Description==
This necklace was made from [[gold]] and hung down to the chest. It was studded with various [[gemstone]]s.

==Powers==
Wearing this necklace made it much easier for the wearer to resist the effects of any charm magic. Furthermore, focusing on the gems of the necklace would reveal the location of the spellcaster who attempted the use of charm magic upon the wearer.

==History==
These magic necklaces were traditionally worn by Precepts of [[Mulhorand]].
