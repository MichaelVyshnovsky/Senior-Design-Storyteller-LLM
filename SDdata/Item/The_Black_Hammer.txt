'''''The Black Hammer''''' was an enchanted [[warhammer]] crafted out of a horn of an ancient [[black dragon]].

==Description==
The hammer's head was made out of blackened bone. It was long and curved, ending with a sharp point on one end. The surface of the head was notched with many tiny line grooves burned by [[acid]]. The weapon's shaft was a thick and sturdy stick of iron-bound wood decorated with sharp iron spikes. The ''[[holy symbol]]'' of [[Bhaal]] was burned into the handle with acid.

==Powers==
''The Black Hammer'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and, due to the material it was carved out of, the hammer's head was always excreting powerful acid. When the wielder swung and hit the opponent with ''the Black Hammer'', its enchantment inadvertently splashed everyone around them with acid. The hammer also gave the wielder ''[[darkvision]]''.

==History==
Sometime before [[1372 DR]], ''the Black Hammer'' belonged to an evil and cruel priestess of Bhaal, [[Niaal Sortan]]. She used this magical hammer as both a weapon of war and a torture device as it constantly dripped with caustic acid. She often ventured outside her [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|temple]] in [[Liam's Hold]] for her late-night sadistic adventures. One such nightly trip ended up costing her her life when she was ambushed by a group of [[ranger]]s seeking to end her evil life. Even though they ended the priestess, they themselves succumbed to the splash damage of the hammer, leaving no-one alive in the aftermath of the battle.

At some point after her death, the hammer was broken in two. The head was lost somewhere in the [[Lizard Marsh]] and the haft was tossed into a cavern in the [[Blade Cliffs]] area of the [[Sword Coast]]. Sole believed that the master blacksmith of [[Daggerford]], [[Derval Ironeater]] reforged the weapon after both pieces were found in [[1372 DR]].
