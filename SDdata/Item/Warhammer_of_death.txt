'''''Warhammers of Death''''' were enchanted [[dwarf|dwarven]] two-handed [[warhammer]]s from the city of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The {{SI|20|lb|k|long=yes}} bludgeon was cast out of black [[steel]].

==Powers==
''Warhammer of Death'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that became a dramatically powerful magic weapon when wielded against [[undead]] creatures. One such weapon also possessed the power to cast the ''[[Poison (spell)|poison]]'' [[spell]] at will.

==History==
After the fall of Myth Drannor in the [[Weeping War]], ''Warhammers of Death'' could be found in the Great Hall of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, one of these black bludgeons was wielded by an [[orc]] [[shaman]] who served [[Mol the Great]], who led the tribe that claimed part of the Dwarven Dungeons as its territory.
