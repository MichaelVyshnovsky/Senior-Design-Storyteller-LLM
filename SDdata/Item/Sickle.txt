The sickle was a farm implement slightly modified and strengthened to make a simple, light melee weapon.
This weapon was a reinforced form of a farmers sickle commonly used to harvest grains. It had a handle to which was attached a blade that was curved in more or less a semicircle, coming to a sharp point.
Because of its shape, the sickle could also be used in trip attacks. 
The sickle was preferred by druids and by people who wanted to carry a weapon yet remain inconspicuous to guards.
