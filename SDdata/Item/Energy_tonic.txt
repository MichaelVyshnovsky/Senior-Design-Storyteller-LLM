'''Energy tonic''' was a special concoction, created to be consumed by sluggish [[warforged]], exclusively, invigorating them.

==Uses==
Energy tonics were bottled in [[glass]] receptacles. The liquid was sweet-tasting and bubbly. The tonics came in normal quality, strong, and [[enchanted]], with the enchanted variety being the most potent and expensive among the three. The strong variety had a more pungent taste and could revitalize a warforged's mind. The enchanted variety was an [[oil]]y substance.

==History==
Energy tonics were introduced to [[Toril]] and the village of [[Eveningstar]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], when adventurers from the world of [[Eberron]], in including the warforged adventurers, set out to investigate the happenings in the infamous [[Haunted Halls]].
