'''''Omuan dreamcatchers''''' were wondrous items that trapped nightmares, found in the ruins of the Forbidden City of [[Omu]].

{{quote|''This? Oh, nothing really. Just a little curiosity. Hope, my tenacious petal clinging to the flower despite winter, nature, and all common sense, this is an Omuan dreamcatcher. No? No recognition? Well, all right. This tinkly-featherly device is a jar. A jar for dreams. Currently full to bursting, I don't mind telling you.''|[[Raphael]]}}

==Powers==
''Omuan dreamcatchers'' were [[enchanted]] woven trinkets of woven nets and feathers that were used by the ancient Omuans to trap the nightmares that plagued the city's children, granting them restful sleep. The nightmares and fears trapped within ''Omuan dreamcatchers'' were less of an esoteric nature and more of nightmarish beings that, when trapped together, mixed, blended, and empowered eachother and, when given opportunity, "went bump in the night."

==History==
Sometime during several decades of imprisonment before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[cambion]] spawn of [[Mephistopheles]] â€“ Raphael, used an ancient ''Omuan dreamcatcher'' full of nightmares to torture [[Hope (cleric)|Hope]], in attempts to break her will and force her into servitude.
