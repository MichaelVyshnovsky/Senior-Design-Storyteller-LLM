'''Chateau O'Kane''' was a variety of [[wine]] in [[the Vast]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]] that was produced by [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]].In wine naming conventions, the use of the word "Chateau" is traditionally used to indicate the country estate in which a wine was produced. As the wine bares his name and he personally gifted a bottle of it, it stands to reason that Charles himself was the producer of Chateau O'Kane. 

==History==
Sometime in the early 1370's DR, Charles personally gifted a bottle of this wine to [[Micah Starfire]] as thanks for helping him track down some pirates.The bottle is stated to be vintage "72", presumably referring to 1372 DR, and the year is referred to in the past tense as having been a "good year". One of the player handouts for ''It Just So Happens...'' states that [[Amber Lynn Thoden]] is the mayor and that the adventure is taking place on [[Marpenoth 22]] in [[1378 DR]]. However, this date is irreconcilable with Thoden's term in office, which at the most lasted into early 1372 DR.
