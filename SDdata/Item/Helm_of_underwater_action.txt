Helms of underwater action were enchanted helmets that allowed the wearer to survive underwater.
These helms appeared mundane at first glance and only through means of magical detection could one determine their enchanted nature. Two small lenses were hidden on both sides in the helms compartments.
Helms of underwater action possessed magics that allowed their wearers to see and breathe underwater. The visual part was done via the helms lenses drawn from hidden compartments. They were positioned at the eye level of the wearer, activating the magics that allowed them to see underwater. Upon utterance of a command word, a helm of underwater action produced a globe of breathable air around the wearer and maintained the magics indefinitely or until dismissed.
A capable cleric trained in crafting of wondrous items could create a helm of underwater action with the use of a water breathing spell.
Helms of underwater action were popular implements among those creatures unable to normally utter words and cast spells underwater.
