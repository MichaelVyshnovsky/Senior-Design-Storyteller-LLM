'''''Helms of underwater action''''' were [[enchanted]] [[helmet]]s that allowed the wearer to survive underwater.

==Description==
These helms appeared mundane at first glance and only through means of [[Detect magic|magical detection]] could one determine their enchanted nature. Two small [[lenses]] were hidden on both sides in the helm's compartments.

==Powers==
''Helms of underwater action'' possessed magics that allowed their wearers to see and breathe underwater. The visual part was done via the helm's lenses drawn from hidden compartments. They were positioned at the eye level of the wearer, activating the magics that allowed them to see underwater. Upon utterance of a [[command word]], a ''helm of underwater action'' produced a globe of breathable air around the wearer and maintained the magics indefinitely or until dismissed.

===Creation===
A capable [[cleric]] trained in crafting of wondrous items could create a ''helm of underwater action'' with the use of a ''[[water breathing]]'' spell.

==Reputation==
''Helms of underwater action'' were popular implements among those creatures unable to normally utter words and cast spells underwater.
