        "mainbody": "'''''Masks of Death''''' were [[enchanted]] [[mask (object)|mask]]s worn by [[Myrkulyte]]s and later, by [[Cyricist]]s.",
        "Description": "''Masks of Death'' were items carved of [[ivory]] and shaped to resemble a [[human]] skull.",
        "Powers": "[[Magic]] imbued into ''Masks of Death'' allowed the wearer to access several [[spell]]s once per day each. The wearer could shroud themselves in ''[[death armor]]'' and could sap life force with a mere touch as by the ''[[vampiric touch]]'' spell. The most dangerous property was when a ''Mask'' flew off the wearer's face and bit into a target at the wearer's bidding. If successful, the bite functioned as the ''[[finger of death]]'' spell. A ''Mask of Death'' flew back onto the owner's face when the attack was completed.",
        "History": "Originally, ''Masks of Death'' were created to be used by several sects that worshiped [[Myrkul]]. After the deity's death during the [[Time of Troubles]], followers of [[Cyric]] started claiming the items as their own. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one such ''Mask'' belonged to [[Mephasm]], a [[pit fiend]] trapped and forced into service by the [[warlock]] [[Ammon Jerro]]. Only the most cunning and charismatic individuals could haggle the magic item from the creature."
