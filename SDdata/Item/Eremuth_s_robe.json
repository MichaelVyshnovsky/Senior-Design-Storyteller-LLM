        "mainbody": "'''''Eremuth's robe''''' was the [[enchanted]] [[robe]] that belonged to [[Eremuth Silverwind]], the bastard of the [[Hawkwinter]]  noble family of [[Waterdeep]], and later, the [[malaugrym]] agent of the [[Unseen]] who assumed Silverwind's identity.",
        "Description": "''Eremuth's robe'' was masterfully crafted clothing of the finest quality.",
        "Powers": "This robe possessed a minor enchantment that enhanced the wearer's ability to dodge out of the harm's way as well as granted them small resistance to fire, mundane and magical.",
        "History": "''Eremuth's robe'' was created to be at the hight of Waterdhavian fashion ''circa'' [[1323 DR]]. Strangely outdated design, however, did not bother Eremuth Silverwind when he, secretly a malaugrym, joined the [[Hero of Daggerford]]'s adventuring party. The hero wondered how Eremuth hasn't been killed for audacity to wear this outfit in the [[Moonsea]] region."
