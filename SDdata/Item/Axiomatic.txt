'''Axiomatic''' weapons were those imbued or otherwise [[item enchantment|enchanted]] with the power of [[law]] that were especially harmful when wielded against creatures of [[chaos]].

==Powers==
Axiomatic weapons inflicted more grievous wounds whenever they struck a creature or being of [[chaotic]] alignment. Similarly, any chaotic person that attempted to pick an axiomatic weapon up were severely weakened until they let it go.
