Axiomatic weapons were those imbued or otherwise enchanted with the power of law that were especially harmful when wielded against creatures of chaos.
Axiomatic weapons inflicted more grievous wounds whenever they struck a creature or being of chaotic alignment. Similarly, any chaotic person that attempted to pick an axiomatic weapon up were severely weakened until they let it go.
