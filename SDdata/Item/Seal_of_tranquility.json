It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nSilverhand crafted the seal to represent Joppas monkish discipline.\nThe disk was light enough to float, and could neutralize rough waters.\nIn combat, it had a similarly calming effect on the spirits of Joppas enemies, making them much more likely to make mistakes.\n* Joppa, a human monk to whom Silverhand also gifted the harpoon of sudden stillness."
