        "mainbody": "The seal of circumspection was a unique enchanted trinket crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Naomlen Girdaur in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nIt was a delicate metal charm engraved with silver linework. The center had been worn to a dull finish owing to Naomlen clutching it in her gloved hands, but the linework was still clearly visible. This was a feature of the charm, and was meant to represent the strength of Naomlens spirit to shine through even in adversity.\nGrasping the seal of circumspection granted Naomlen the ability to escape her enemies notice, helping to conceal her and information about her.\n* Naomlen Girdaur, a dwarf rogue and assassin to whom Silverhand also gifted the blades of abundant caution."
