        "mainbody": "The '''''seal of circumspection''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] trinket crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Naomlen Girdaur]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"[[Silverhand gear]]\" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "It was a delicate metal charm engraved with [[silver]] linework. The center had been worn to a dull finish owing to Naomlen clutching it in her gloved hands, but the linework was still clearly visible. This was a feature of the charm, and was meant to represent the strength of Naomlen's spirit to shine through even in adversity.",
        "Powers": "Grasping the ''seal of circumspection'' granted Naomlen the ability to escape her enemies' notice, helping to conceal her and information about her.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Naomlen Girdaur, a [[dwarf]] [[rogue]] and [[assassin]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[blades of abundant caution]]''."
