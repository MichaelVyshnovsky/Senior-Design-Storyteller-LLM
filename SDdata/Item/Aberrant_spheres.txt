'''Aberrant spheres''' were magical devices that summoned [[aberration]]s to the user.

==Description==
The surfaces of such spheres seemed to flash words in the speaker's native tongue, just visible enough to remain unidentifiable.

==Powers==
The spheres renewed their three charges each day. By spending one charge, a [[choker]] was summoned; by spending two charges, a [[grick]] was summoned instead; and by spending three charges, the creature summoned was a [[carrion crawler]]. The summoned creature remained for slightly more than half a minute, commensurate with the power of the spheres themselves. For as long as the monster was still present, the owner's mind became more vulnerable.

On summoning the monster, the sphere shattered, reforming after their departure or destruction; no more than one monster could be summoned at a time.

==History==
These spheres were created by alienists and other cultists who worshiped aberrant entities.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Binders}}
