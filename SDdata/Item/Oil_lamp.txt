A '''lamp''' was a basic illuminating device suited for indoors.

==Description==
Typical lamps consisted of a fuel reservoir (typically [[oil]]) and a [[wick]] to burn the fuel. Since the flame was unprotected, lamps could easily go out in the event of a breeze. They were also more difficult to carry than [[hooded lantern|lanterns]]. For those reasons, lamps were more suitable for indoor illumination. They shed light as long as the supply of fuel lasted, typically 6 hours for 1 pint (473 ml) of oil.

Different types of crafted lamps were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
