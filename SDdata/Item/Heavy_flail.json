        "mainbody": "Heavy flails, otherwise known as a footmans flail,\nHeavy flails typically had longer shafts, about  long, with a hinged or chained heavier spiked ball or rod on the end. Some had an elongated top spike to give them even greater reach..\nHeavy flails were typically used as two-handed weapons. They could be used to trip an opponent and their flexible chains increased the chance of entangling an enemy weapons, thereby disarming them.\nHeavy flails derived from an agricultural tool known as a threshing flail.\n* Fugitive slaves that had escaped from farms were liable to wield a footmans flail as a weapon, due to having experience with threshing flails."
