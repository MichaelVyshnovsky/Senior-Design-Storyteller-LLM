        "mainbody": "tirrups were a type of accessory for saddles, designed to help riders climb on to them and better control their mounts. They also enabled mounted combatants to put greater force behind their attacks and remain on their saddles when struck by forceful blows.\nStirrups typically consisted of leather straps that were attached to each side of a saddle by a hook and several ties. These straps ended in a metal foot rest, either in the form of a ring or a pointed cup.\nthumb|260px|Thunderstorm shows off the proper usage of a stirrup.\nA stirrup was controlled with the foot. For example, Benelaius speculated that Kendras big feet helped her hold her stirrups well and ride better.\nIf a rider fell from the saddle, they risked getting their foot caught in a stirrup and being dragged on the ground or even beneath their mount, so they would try to free their foot when they fell.\n* In Athkatla, one could find stirrups for sale at the market Waukeens Promenade.For Duty & Deity states that every nonmagical item featured in the Arms and Equipment Guide can be purchased at Waukeens Promenade.\n* In the hamlet of Longsaddle, Nalathars Fine Stirrups & Spurs provided customers high-quality stirrups of a plain design for a single silver piece each.\n* In Zhentil Keep, one could find stirrups for sale at Litas Equipment.Ruins of Zhentil Keep states that everything from the Arms and Equipment Guide, except for arms and armor, can be purchased at Litas Equipment.\nStirrups were not invented on Toril until after the fall of the Netherese Empire.
