        "Usage": "[[File:Spellplague FRCG.jpg|thumb|260px|''[[Thunderstorm]] shows off the proper usage of a stirrup.'']]\nA stirrup was controlled with the foot. For example, [[Benelaius]] speculated that [[Kendra]]'s big feet helped her hold her stirrups well and ride better.<ref>\n\nIf a rider fell from the saddle, they risked getting their foot caught in a stirrup and being dragged on the ground or even beneath their mount, so they would try to free their foot when they fell.<ref>",

        "History": "Stirrups were not invented on [[Toril]] until after the fall of the [[Netherese Empire]]. The eventual introduction of the stirrup allowed the [[polearm]]s known as [[lance]]s to become prevalent weaponry for those on mounts. It was considered nearly impossible for a mounted fighter to charge effectively with a leveled lance without them.\n\nThe eventual introduction of both the saddle and stirrup in the land of [[Zakhara]] caused the vehicles known as [[chariot]]s to gradually fall out of widespread use.",

            "Businesses": "* [[Norge Greenback's Horses]] kept a lot of stirrups in storage for handling their horses.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/103/The Living City: The Horse Businesses|15}}",
            "Regions & Settlements": "* Stirrups were utilized by horseman in the [[Hordelands]].\n* Stirrups were utilized in the land of Zakhara."

        "Trivia": "The war god [[Tempus]] was said to most often, prior to battles, manifest as a warrior riding with a foot in the stirrup of two separate horses. Symbolizing the chaotic nature of warfare."
