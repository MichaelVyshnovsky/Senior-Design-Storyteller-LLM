        "mainbody": "Handaxes were a type of light, martial melee weapon in the axe family.\nHandaxes were similar to hatchets in size and shape. Their shafts were usually made of wood, though metal was sometimes used. Their blades were single-edged and their back sides were either unadorned, spiked, or had a peen. Handaxes were heavier than throwing axes and not balanced enough to be used effectively as a thrown weapon.\nClassified as a light weapon, handaxes were often used while grappling an opponent.
