The '''''scimitar of slaying''''' was the unique [[enchanted]] [[scimitar]] that belonged to a hero of [[Myth Drannor]], [[Sindar]] the Warrior.

==Description==
This scimitar had a curved edge like other weapons of the same type. One distinct feature of the blade was its vicious-looking ragged edge.

==Powers==
The ''Scimitar of slaying'' held a ''+3'' enchantment and it enhanced the wielder's physical strength.

==History==
The owner of the ''scimitar of slaying'', Sindar,  was one of the ancient heroes interred within one of the crypts within the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the scimitar was still inside Sindar's sarcophagus. His spirit, along with several other heroes' in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the [[Weeping War]]. Bound to eternally guard his prized possession, Sindar in his [[wraith]] shape was ready to tear apart any would-be grave robber.
