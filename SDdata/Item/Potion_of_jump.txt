'''''Potions of jump''''' was a [[potion]] that granted its imbiber effects similar to that of the ''[[jump]]'' [[spell]].

==Creations==
One of the recipe for a ''potion of jump'' required the [[alchemist]] to prepare a sublimate of [[wispweed]] first and then, carefully mix it with a certain type of ashes.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Lupperdiddle Swires]], a tiny [[gnome|gnomish]] adventurer, who reportedly, bounced {{SI|20'|'"|long=yes}} into the air in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Cult of the Dragon]]: [[necromancer]]s of the Cult of the Dragon, under the command of [[Kya Mordrayn]], were known to carry ''potions of jump'' in [[1369 DR]]. These spellcasters could be found in the [[Tower of Bones]] on [[Polyandrium]] as well as [[Castle Cormanthor]].
* Scouts of the [[drow]] [[House Dhuurniv]] were outfitted with ''potions of jump'' in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].
