        "Powers": "Every time an [[arrow]] was notched on an ''oathbow'', it whispered a phrase in [[Elven language|elvish]] to its attuned user acknowledging its readiness to accept a sworn opponent. If the user responded with the command phrase upon loosing the arrow towards an opponent, that target became the bow's sworn enemy for seven days, or until death. The magic of the ''oathbow'' rendered it extremely precise when shooting arrows toward its sworn enemy, even if behind cover or at extremely long distances. Arrows that hit the ''oathbow's'' designated target were also rendered extremely deadly. At the same time, a committed ''oathbow'' became considerably ineffective at shooting at any target other than its current sworn enemy.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| source = The ''oathbow'' command phrase\n| text   = Swift death to you who have wronged me.\n}}\nAn ''oathbow'' could be reset to a new enemy the dawn after its previous target died.
