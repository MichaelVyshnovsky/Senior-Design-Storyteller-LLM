Whispering staff was an enchanted goblin ironwood staff, once wielded by sorcerer Caballus.
The staff was short, carved to accommodate a goblin so that a taller humanoid would wield it as a one-handed bludgeon with ease. Whispering staff was carved with snaking runes. Most were decorative gibberish, apart from a rune of accuracy and a rune of wounding that gave the staff its powers.
Whispering staff possessed a +1 enchantment and had a very slight chance of silencing a target upon a successful strike. Additionally, whispering staff enhanced the wielder skills to move soundlessly.
In the , the city of Targos laid besieged by a force of savage goblinoids of the north. A goblin sorcerer named Caballus led an assault on the town and flooded the city with raiders after magically penetrating its fortifications. Caballus wielded his whispering staff when he closed with a band of mercenaries from Luskan. Subsequently, the sorcerer was slain, and whispering staff changed owners.
