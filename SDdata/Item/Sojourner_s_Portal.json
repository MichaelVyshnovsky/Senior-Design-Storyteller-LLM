        "mainbody": "The '''''Sojourner's Portal''''' was a [[magical item]] taking the form of a [[mirror]] that stood within the [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Selûne]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was able to open ''[[gate]]s'' to many other places.",
        "Description": "Standing at the end of a short corridor on the temple's second floor, between the cimeliarch (treasury) and dormitory, it was an antique, oval-shaped mirror with an ornate [[silver]] frame that was tarnished with great age. Although it seemed unremarkable, a ''[[detect magic]]'' [[spell]] or the like would reveal an aura of [[alteration]] [[magic]]. However, if one stared into it for several minutes, their reflected image was somehow altered. Different people saw different degrees of change, but those who did tended toward the view that the mirror reflected how a person truly saw themselves.\n\nWhen used as a portal, the glass appeared as a silvery fog.",
        "Powers": "The primary power of ''Sojourner's Portal'', and the one for which it was named, was to open one-way ''gates'' within the mirror to certain other places in [[Faerûn]] that were holy to the Moonmaiden. This could be done with a quietly spoken [[command word]], one only known by high priestess [[Naneatha Suaril]] and a few of her closest advisors, such as [[Kyriani Agrivar]]. The command word was strangely difficult to remember. Passage through the portal was smooth and with disorientation.\n\nThe destinations were also secret, but among the possibilities were the sister temples of the [[Moonmaiden's Hall]] in [[Murann]], [[Amn]]; the [[House of the Lady]] in [[Immersea]], [[Cormyr]]; and the [[Temple of Silver Stars]] in [[Silverymoon]] in the [[North]]; somewhere near their allies at the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] on [[Undermountain]]'s third level; a fabled lost city of Selûnites in the South, such as ruined [[Minsorran]] on the shore of [[Lake Weng]] or even [[Myth Lharast]], both in [[Amn]]; Selûne herself could create a link to her own realm, [[Argentil]] in the [[Gates of the Moon]].",
        "History": "Amidst the havoc of [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the magic of the ''Sojourner's Portal'' became warped so that it worked the other way, and the mirror unleashed a [[crimson death]] and three [[vampiric mist]]s from the depths of Undermountain into the heart of the temple. They hunted and slew a number of priests before they were stopped; the vampiric mists were swiftly destroyed, but the crimson death fled into the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers of Waterdeep]] and was lost. Meanwhile, Naneatha was able to redirect the ''gate'', sending subsequent monsters—a [[sahuagin]] patrol, an [[ettin]], two [[trapper]]s, and a [[pyrohydra]]—into the crypts below [[Shar]]'s [[Temple of Old Night]] in [[Calimport]]. In the year after, Naneatha reconsidered that a portal in the middle of her temple might just be a security risk.\n\nThe [[1370 DR|following year]], Kyriani used the ''Sojourner's Portal'' to transport a group of [[adventurers]] to Argentil, at the base of the [[Infinite Staircase]], so that they might use it to reach the [[Abyss]] and rescue the goddess [[Waukeen]] from her captivity by [[Graz'zt]]."
