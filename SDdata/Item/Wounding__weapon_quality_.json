        "mainbody": "The '''''wounding''''' quality was a [[weapon quality]] that induced the loss of blood.",
        "Powers": "A weapon with the ''wounding'' quality caused blood loss for those that were hit by it. However, the victims needed a discernible anatomy to suffer from this property. Therefore, creatures like [[construct]]s or even [[Plant creature|plants]] were unaffected by it.\n\nTo craft weapons with the ''wounding'' quality, the crafter required knowledge of how to create magical arms and the [[spell]] ''[[Mordenkainen's sword]]''.",
        "Uses": "The spell ''[[bloodspear]]'', which [[cleric]]s of [[Gruumsh]] who were initiated in their faith's secrets could cast, allowed them to temporarily turn a [[spear]], their god's favored weapon, into a ''wounding spear''.\n\nThe ''[[rapier of puncturing]]'' was a special kind of ''+2 wounding [[rapier]]'' that was often used by the [[assassin]]s of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], such as [[Nimor Imphraezl]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6-7}}\n\nSome veteran [[Thayan gladiator]]s had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as ''wounding'' weapons."
