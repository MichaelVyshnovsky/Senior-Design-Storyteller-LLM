The Lens of Oghma, part of the Fading Rings set, was a unique enchanted ring that bore the name of Oghma, the Lord of Knowledge.
The Lens of Oghma was a signet ring decorated with two gems of chilling blue color, resembling a pair of eyes.
This ring was only usable by sorcerers and possessed the power to cast the true seeing spell. Additionally, it enhanced the wearers chances of hitting their target with a spell or a weapon, similarly to a +4 enchantment.
In 1369 DR, Lens of Oghma was possessed by the Great Stone Head, a monument in Myth Drannors the Nightingale Court. In exchange for one of the eidolons, small totemic statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic Fading Rings. This ring was one of the set depicting the cold eyes of Oghma and gave the wearer the gift of true sight.
