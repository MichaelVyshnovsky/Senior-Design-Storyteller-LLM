        "Powers": "Aiedo's reed staves possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and had a good chance of affecting the target's strength upon a successful strike, making them noticeably weaker and frail.",
        "History": "[[Meng Aiedo]], a weapon maker renowned for his work with various tall grasses and [[bamboo]] of [[Kara-Tur]], discovered a sturdy species of reed in the [[Lhespenbog]]'s reed-fields in the [[Eastern Shaar]]. From those plants, Aiedo started crafting the so-called ''Aiedo wither-sticks''.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Aiedo's reed weapons found their way to the [[Sword Coast]] region and eventually fell into the hands of [[quarterstaff]] users in the city of [[Neverwinter]]."
