        "mainbody": "'''Shameo''' was a fermented alcoholic drink made and consumed by the [[Nubari]] [[Zantira]] tribe of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite polyhedron/113/Raft Dwellers: The Zantiri Tribe|6-7}}",
        "Description": "The drink was made out of thick roots of [[shameo water lily]] that grew in the shallows of the [[Sleepy Lake]] where it was foraged by the Zantira children and women. The roots were ground and juiced. The resulting drink was fermented until it became the local specialty intoxicant. Shameo was a colorless and bitter-tasting alcoholic drink, one of the main trading commodities produced by the Zantira."
