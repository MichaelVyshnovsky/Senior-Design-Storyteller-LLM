        "mainbody": "A spider mask was a drow item that allowed wearers to transverse any web safely.\nA spider mask was a black velvet mask with four jointed wire legs protruding from each side of it. It covered the wearers face completely.\nA spider mask gave a total of three powers to the wearer. First, it gave the wearer infravision with a range of 90 ft (27 m). Second, it gave the wearer complete immunity against webs of all sort, this included the web spell and the wand of viscid globs. Third, the spider mask conferred some protection against poison from vermins like spiders.\nThe spider mask was a magic item that was associated with the drow.\nA spider mask was used by both Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri to cross the magical fence of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan that otherwise defeated all other attempts at intrusion. Later Artemis used the same mask to escape a web spell cast by Vendes Baenre. It later fell into the possession of Gromph Baenre."
