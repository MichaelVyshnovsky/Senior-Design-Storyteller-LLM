        "mainbody": "Crystal Ale was a variety of ale created by the dwarvish alesmith of Ravens Bluff named Bowser in the late 14 century DR.\nCrystal Ale was a delicate and watery refreshing drink brewed and fermented in a special type of magical crystal. The libation was described as drinking a \"clear breeze on a spring day.\" Crystal Ale was favored by the Fair Folk, despite them having high alcohol tolerance, while dwarven customers preferred most other ales of Bowsers making.\nIn the , Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast. The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking â€“ Dark Maiden Wine, to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale, so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making, including Crystal Ale."
