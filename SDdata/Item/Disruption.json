It could destroy undead outright.\nWhenever an undead foe was struck with a disruption weapon, it had to successfully resist the effect with an effort of will or be destroyed instantly.\nOne who would enchant a disruption weapon had to have the heal spell available. The property could only be used on a bludgeoning weapon, such as a club or mace.\nSome veteran Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as weapons of disruption. \n* Dawnspeaker, the personal weapon of the sun god Lathander.\n* Celestial maces, the favored weapons of astral devas.\n* Maces of disruption, undead-slaying maces that could be improved with the use of illithium.\n* A flail of disruption was carried by Gogal in Zakhara."
