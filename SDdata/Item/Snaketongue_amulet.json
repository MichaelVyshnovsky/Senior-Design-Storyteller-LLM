Eventually, more agents and assassins of the mysterious organization that worshiped an interloper deity [[Zehir]] started appearing in the [[Sword Coast North]] and Samarach, attempting to undermine mercantile activities of merchant [[Sa'Sani]] and a group of her mercenaries turned business partners."
