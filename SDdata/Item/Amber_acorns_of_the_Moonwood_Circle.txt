The '''''amber acorns of the Moonwood Circle''''' was the name for a type of necklace made by the [[druid]]s who lived in the [[Moonwood]] forest.

==Description==
The necklace appeared as four acorns carved from [[amber]], strung together with a cord that resembled interwoven roots. Each acorn contained a small piece of [[elemental]] matter, one for each of the four elements: [[air]], [[earth (element)|earth]], [[fire]], and [[water]].

==History==
Prior to their disappearance in [[1305 DR]], following a series of conflicts with the [[People of the Black Blood]] known as the [[Beast Wars]], the [[Moonwood Circle|druids of the Moonwood]] had set up a series of caches of magical items across what was then called the [[Silver Marches]]. The most well-known of these items were the amber acorn necklaces.

==Powers==
Once per day, the wearer of this necklace could cast ''[[summon nature's ally VI]]'' and conjure forth a creature attuned to each elemental type. Each elementally attuned acorn had one daily charge, allowing for four creatures to be summoned.
