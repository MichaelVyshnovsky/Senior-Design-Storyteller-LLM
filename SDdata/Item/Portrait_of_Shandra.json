Shandras image looked past the observer, and her face held a beautiful light smile.\nIn the , gnomish painter Pepin Pollo traveled from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep to the Jewel of North, Neverwinter, where he made coin by painting portraits of those who could pay for the service. One day, the person who would later be known as Knight-Captain came across the diminutive artist. Shandra Jerro was one of Kalach-Chas new companions, and her beauty instantly captivated Pepin. The painter shooed away the woman whose portrait he was working on and immediately began creating the Portrait of Shandra. From his inspiration was born a beautiful and masterful painting Pollo called his masterpiece. The Knight-Captain purchased the painting for Shandra however, it left her possession soon after when Shandra was murdered by her grandfather â€“ the infamous warlock Ammon Jerro."
