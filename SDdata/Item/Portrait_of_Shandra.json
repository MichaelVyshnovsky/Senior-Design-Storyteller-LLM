        "mainbody": "The '''''Portrait of Shandra''''' was a painting created by [[Pepin Pollo]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ''Portrait of Shandra'' was a masterfully painted image of [[Shandra Jerro]], a one-time companion of the famed Knight-Captain, sometimes referred to as [[Kalach-Cha]]. Shandra's image looked past the observer, and her face held a beautiful light smile.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[gnome|gnomish]] painter Pepin Pollo traveled from the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]] to the Jewel of North, [[Neverwinter]], where he made coin by painting portraits of those who could pay for the service. One day, the person who would later be known as Knight-Captain came across the diminutive artist. Shandra Jerro was one of Kalach-Cha's new companions, and her beauty instantly captivated Pepin. The painter shooed away the woman whose portrait he was working on and immediately began creating the ''Portrait of Shandra''. From his inspiration was born a beautiful and masterful painting Pollo called his masterpiece. The Knight-Captain purchased the painting for Shandra; however, it left her possession soon after when Shandra was murdered by her grandfather – the infamous [[warlock]] [[Ammon Jerro]]."
