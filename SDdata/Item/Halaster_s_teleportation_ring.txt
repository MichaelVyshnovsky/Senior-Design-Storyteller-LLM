Halasters teleportation rings were magic items that allowed the wearer to teleport without error.
Once relatively common, these rare rings could teleport the wearer from their current location to a predetermined location on the same plane upon speaking a command word or through sheer force of will. However, Halaster cursed these rings to transport the wearer to a location of his choosing. To make matters worse, all of the equipment carried by the wearer, including the teleportation ring, would be stripped from them during the teleportation and scattered throughout Undermountain.
The command word for these rings was "Athlas", which meant "lost" in an ancient northern dialect.
These rings were placed throughout the ruins of Undermountain.
