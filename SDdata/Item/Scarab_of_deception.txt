'''''Scarabs of deception''''' were [[magic item]]s that deceived [[divination]] magic.

==Powers==
The wearer of this brooch was able to deceive divination attempts targeted at them. The ''scarab of deception'' alerted the wearer to the exact type of divination being attempted upon them, but not from whence it came. Aware of the intrusion, the wearer could pick which information was received by the divination attempt or provide false information. These items had 9â€“14 charges and each use expended a single charge.

==History==
These magical items, and many others like them, originated in the ancient kingdoms of [[Nog]] and [[Kadar]] in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region of [[Zakhara]] and were fairly common there.

==Notable Owners==
[[Barak al-Gani]], a priest of [[Shajar]] in [[east Zakhara]], owned a ''scarab of deception'' that he boldly used to trick the powerful [[necromancer]] rulers of [[Ysawis]].
