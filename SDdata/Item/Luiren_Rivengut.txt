'''Luiren Rivengut''' was a notoriously strong [[whiskey]] drink created by the [[halflings]] of [[Luiren]].
{{quote|''[[Finder Wyvernspur|Finder]] took a swig from the flask and spat it out, gagging and coughing. "What is this?" he asked. "Luiren Rivengut," the halfling said. "Best whiskey there is". "[[Tymora]]! If the poison doesn't get me, this stuff will!" Finder muttered.''}}

==Description==
Commonly distilled and aged in Luiren, this clear alcoholic liquid was infamous throughout the [[Western Heartlands]] for its potency.

Halflings used Rivengut to disinfect cuts and bruises as often as they used it to get drunk.

==History==
Like many halflings, a famous [[Harper]] agent and "bard" [[Olive Ruskettle]] was a lover of the deadly whiskey. She often carried a flask of the liquid on her ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

[[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] carried a flask of this hard liquor on him in 1358 DR. Both he and his future wife [[Cat (person)|Cat]] enjoyed Rivengut.

Another Harper agent and a nobleman from [[Waterdeep]], [[Danilo Thann]], always carried flasks of alcohol in his ''[[bag of holding]]'', one of them being Luiren Rivengut.
