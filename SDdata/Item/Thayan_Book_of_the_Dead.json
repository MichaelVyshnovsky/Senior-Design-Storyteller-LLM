        "mainbody": "he Thayan Book of the Dead was an artifact book penned by a long-forgotten Thayan Zulkir of Necromancy, many years before the 15 century DR.\nThe Thayan Book of the Dead not only held dark spells of the Red Wizards, but it also imbued the wielder with the power and knowledge needed to perform its horrific rites and rituals. In addition to its arcane power, the tome allowed the wielder to summon deadly undead creatures under the books owners control. Lastly, when the Thayan Book of the Dead was used alongside the Carcanet of the Dead  and Lacings of the Dead, the book granted the wielder boosted blocking, sprinting, and dodging skills, as well as increased their movement speed and physical power.\nThe Thayan Book of the Dead dated back to the years before Szass Tam claimed the position of the Zulkir of Necromancy from his vampire predecessor. The books author was a Zulkir of Necromancy, whose name was lost to time. Only several copies of the book existed as of the late 15 century DR."
