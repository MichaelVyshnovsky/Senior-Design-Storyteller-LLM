A '''totem''' was a symbolic representation of a spirit. They were typically used in [[barbarian]] tribes

<nowiki> </nowiki>Tribes generally had only one totem spirit that they worshiped, though there were exceptions to this.

==Description==
[[File:Wolf_skull_WoW.png|thumb|A [[wolf]] skull totem belonging to the [[half-orc]] barbarian [[Raika]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.]]Totems varied wildly in how they were depicted and through what medium. Some were known be carved into trees, painted on [[shield]]s, or etched into stones. Typically they were short rods of wood or bone, carved to resemble a [[nature spirit]] or patron animal. They were often adorned with feathers, scraps of fur, leaves, small bones, and similar symbols of [[primal magic|primal power]].

Barbarians often carried around a personal totem, either tied to an important moment in their lives or of mystical origin. Such totems didn't always represent the totem spirit a barbarian worshiped.

==History==
At some point subsequent to the mineral's discovery in [[1485 DR]], a group of [[Auril]] worshipers established [[item enchantment|enchanted]] totems around [[Icewind Pass]] that would hasten the spread of [[black ice]].

==Notable Totemic Faiths==
* A number of ancient civilizations used totems in the land of [[Chult]].
* The [[Alcheringa]] faith of [[Osse]] revolved around the worship of ancestral heroes as totems.
* The [[Arkaiun]]s of [[Dambrath]] traditionally worshiped a variety of totems. Twice a year their tribes met at a spot in the [[Hills of the Dead Kings]] where over a hundred totems documented the history and future intentions of each clan.<ref>
* [[Frost folk]] were sometimes known to worship the spirits of [[woolly mammoth]]s through totems.
* Almost every clan of [[gnoll]]s had their own totem. These represented a specific race of prey that were religiously significant to them and that the tribe often sacrificed to [[Yeenoghu]]. The most common totems were [[elves]], [[gnome]]s, [[halfling]]s, and [[human]]s. Some less common ones included [[ettin]]s, [[giant]]s, [[kobold]]s, and non-intelligent prey like deer or [[zebra]]s.{{Cite dragon/173/The Sociology of the Flind|82}}
* The tribal sailors who founded the settlement of [[Old Illusk]] worshiped a pantheon of beast totem spirits and this tradition would get passed down to later tribal groups in the region, such as the [[Uthgardt]].
* Every [[Berserker (Rashemi)|berserker]] lodge in the land of [[Rashemen]] had a spirit totem and were watched over by its respective [[telthor]].
* The [[Black Blood cultist|Black Blood cult]] centered around the worship of various totemic beasts alongside [[Malar]] and [[Talona]].

* The [[Tuigan]] were known to worship a variety of beast totems, the two most notable being ones that represented the [[horse]] and [[tiger]].
* The eleven Uthgardt tribes of the North were all named for a distinct totem spirit that each revered. All eleven of the totems were intermediaries of their main deity [[Uthgar]] and were considered the embodiment of their tribe's spirit.
* Besides the Uthgardt tribes, the worship of totems was prominent in the North among the [[Reghedmen]] and [[Ice Hunters]].<ref>
