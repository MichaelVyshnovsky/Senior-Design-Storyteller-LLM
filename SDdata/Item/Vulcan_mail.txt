Vulcan mail was a set of unique heavy armor created by the mad spectral lich of Myth Drannor, Thyaast Ammath.
This set of full plate mail armor had an eery red tint to its metal.
Vulcan mail was a well-crafted set of full plate mail with its defenses further enhanced with a +4 enchantment. The wearer could channel the plates magics into an explosive ball of fire that could be hurled at the enemy, similar to the effect of the fireball spell.
In 1369 DR, the set of Vulcan mail could be recovered from the laboratory of Thyaast Ammath, deep in the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. The magic armor was kept in a heavy locked and trapped chest, guarded by the mad lichs undead servants, two skeleton warriors, a wraith, and a mohrg.
