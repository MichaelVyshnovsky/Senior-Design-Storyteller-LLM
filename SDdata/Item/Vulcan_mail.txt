'''''Vulcan mail''''' was a set of unique [[heavy armor]] created by the mad spectral [[lich]] of [[Myth Drannor]], [[Thyaast Ammath]].

==Description==
This set of full [[plate mail]] armor had an eery red tint to its metal.

==Powers==
''Vulcan mail'' was a well-crafted set of full plate mail with its defenses further enhanced with a ''+4'' enchantment. The wearer could channel the plate's magics into an explosive ball of fire that could be hurled at the enemy, similar to the effect of the ''[[fireball]]'' spell.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the set of ''Vulcan mail'' could be recovered from the laboratory of Thyaast Ammath, deep in the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The magic armor was kept in a heavy locked and trapped chest, guarded by the mad lich's [[undead]] servants, two [[skeleton warrior]]s, a [[wraith]], and a [[mohrg]].
