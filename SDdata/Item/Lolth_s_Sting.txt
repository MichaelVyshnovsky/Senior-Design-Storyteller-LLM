'''''Lolth's Stings''''' were blades wielded by the most devoted [[Lolth]]sworn [[drow]] [[assassin]]s.

==Description==
''Lolth's Stings'' were completely black [[shortsword]]s that did not reflect light. The swords' grips were intricately carved with the image of a web while hundreds of tiny spiders decorated the {{SI|2'|'"|long=yes}} sword's edge.

==Powers==
Apart from a ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand toward a target, these blades possessed two other enchantments. ''Lolth's Blessing'' allowed the wielder be unaffected by mundane and magical ''[[web]]s'', while ''Lolth's Curse'' possessed a chance of ensnaring targets in webs.

==History==
These swords were typically presented as gifts to the drow of the [[Underdark]] who served the Spider Queen and performed assassinations in her honor. Those who wielded ''Lolth's Stings'' waited until the sword's magic cocooned their opponents in magical webs, then finished the job from a distance, using a [[poison]]ed [[dart]] or a [[wrist-crossbow]] [[bolt]].

One of these magic blades fell into the hands of a conniving [[drow]] merchant of exotic goods, [[Nym (Icewind Dale)|Nym]], sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. He offered the sword for sale during his stay in [[Icewind Dale]]'s [[Wandering Village]].
