Lolths Stings were blades wielded by the most devoted Lolthsworn drow assassins.
Lolths Stings were completely black shortswords that did not reflect light. The swords grips were intricately carved with the image of a web while hundreds of tiny spiders decorated the  swords edge.
Apart from a +1 enchantment that guided the wielders hand toward a target, these blades possessed two other enchantments. Lolths Blessing allowed the wielder be unaffected by mundane and magical webs, while Lolths Curse possessed a chance of ensnaring targets in webs.
These swords were typically presented as gifts to the drow of the Underdark who served the Spider Queen and performed assassinations in her honor. Those who wielded Lolths Stings waited until the swords magic cocooned their opponents in magical webs, then finished the job from a distance, using a poisoned dart or a wrist-crossbow bolt.
One of these magic blades fell into the hands of a conniving drow merchant of exotic goods, Nym, sometime before the . He offered the sword for sale during his stay in Icewind Dales Wandering Village.
