'''''Beholder rings''''' were [[enchanted]] rings created through through research of [[beholder]]s by [[Angwile|Angwile the Artificer]] before the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Beholder rings'' enhanced the wearer's peripheral vision and granted them spell-like abilities of beholders' eye stalks. These rings were created each harnessing one stalk's magic, such as ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[charming]]'', ''[[petrify]]'', etc.

==History==
''Beholder rings'' were creations of Angwile the Artificer, a [[svirfneblin]] inventor and sage. The exact number of rings created was unknown, but they all were created before the gnome's untimely petrification in the {{YearlinkName|1009}}.

By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, several of these ''beholder rings'' found their way into the [[Undergate]], [[Westgate]]'s unsavory underbelly, including a ''beholder ring of sleep''.
