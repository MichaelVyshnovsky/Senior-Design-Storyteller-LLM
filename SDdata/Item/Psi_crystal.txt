A psi crystal was purple luminescent crystal that was used to power certain spelljamming vessels.
Psi crystals were used to power mind flayer nautiloids. Some pilots of nautiloid spelljammers carried psi crystal detectors aboard their vessels, in case they ever needed to replace one that was lost or shattered.
The range at which the wielder of a psi crystal could use their telepathic power increased depending on their own inherent intellect.
* Gim, a spacefaring goblin that stole a psi crystal from crew of the Id Ascendant.
