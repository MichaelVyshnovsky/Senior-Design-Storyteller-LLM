A '''''psi crystal''''' was purple luminescent crystal that was used to power certain [[spelljamming]] [[spelljammer|vessels]].

==Powers==
''Psi crystals'' were used to power [[mind flayer]] [[nautiloid]]s. Some pilots of nautiloid [[spelljammer]]s carried ''[[psi crystal detector]]s'' aboard their vessels, in case they ever needed to replace one that was lost or shattered.

The range at which the wielder of a ''psi crystal'' could use their telepathic power increased depending on their own inherent intellect.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Gim]], a spacefaring [[goblin]] that stole a ''psi crystal'' from crew of the ''[[Id Ascendant]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/Tears Among the Stars|11}}
