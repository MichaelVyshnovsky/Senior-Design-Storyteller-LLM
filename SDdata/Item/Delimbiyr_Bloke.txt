The Delimbiyr Bloke, properly called the Face of Gorm was a magical item and holy relic dedicated to the dwarven deity, Gorm Gulthyn.
It was a brick-sized block of shining quartzite carved with an abstract bearded face on it.
The relic was capable of conjuring forth daylight as well as summoning the spirits of ancient dwarf warriors to fight alongside a goodly wielder of the Bloke. These spirits would however attack an evil wielder.
