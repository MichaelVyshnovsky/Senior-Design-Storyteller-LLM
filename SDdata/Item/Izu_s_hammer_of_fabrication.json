        "mainbody": "'''''Izu's hammer of fabrication''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[hammer]] wielded by a loyal [[Harper]] ally named [[Izu]], sometime before [[1373 DR]].",
        "Powers": "The ''hammer of fabrication'' possessed a powerful ''+6'' enchantment, making it a devastating weapon, especially for a [[light hammer]]. Additionally, ''Izu's hammer'' dramatically improved the wielder's mastery over crafting armor and weapons as well as magically imbued them with knowledge of lore. However, the weapon's magic made sure the hammer could only be wielded by a Harper.",
        "History": "[[Izu]] was a blind master smith who died in the [[Silver Marches]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. As the blind smith spent years of his life making enchanted armor and weapons for the Harpers, his heirs gifted ''Izu's hammer of fabrication'' to a young [[Harper scout]] the smith was especially fond of. Sometime later, that Harper went missing, along with the hammer, while mapping the [[Upperdark]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, ''Izu's hammer of fabrication'' found its way to the city of [[Melvaunt]] on the [[Moonsea]]. The hammer was kept by the [[Gondar]] [[priest]]s of [[The Purple Portals]]."
