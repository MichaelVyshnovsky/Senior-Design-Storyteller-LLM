        "mainbody": "masthead of durability was a type of enchanted mast step that vastly improved the durability of any mast that was installed into it. They were primarily used in Realmspace among spelljammers.This item is a \"masthead\" in name only. A masthead is defined as being the top part of a mast, whilst this item is consistently described across sources as being the \"lower support for a mast\". The more appropriate term for such a structural component would be a \"mast step\", something thats located at the base of a mast and designed to support its weight and secure it to a deck.\nThese small silver items were structural supports installed at the base of masts, physically bolting them to their decks.\nAny mast that was equipped with a masthead of durability would be vastly strengthened, becoming virtually indestructible to physical attacks. Additionally, if a spelljammer were to ever attempt shearing off the top of a mast, the ship would suffer damage equivalent to its tonnage. However, they could not protect masts against destruction by fire."
