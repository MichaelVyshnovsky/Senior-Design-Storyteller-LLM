        "mainbody": "'''''Kegsplitter''''' was a simple worn-looking [[enchanted]] [[axe]] created to slay [[ale]] kegs and by an extension of its powers â€“ the occasional [[construct]].",
        "Powers": "''Kegsplitter'' was slightly bigger and slower than the average one-handed [[axe]]. The weapon's haft was etched with minor wounding and ever-sharp ''+1'' [[enchantment]]s. These enchantments made ''Kegsplitter'' effectively a ''+2'' enchanted weapon when wielded against kegs or constructs. However, splitting [[goblin]]s with it was just as easy.",
        "History": "''Kegsplitter'' originated in the small logging village of [[Shaengarne Ford]] in [[Icewind Dale]], created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. Despite its fearsome yet somewhat underwhelming appearance, Kegsplitter saw little battle and was mainly used to split kegs, chop wood, and fell trees. At one point before [[Mirtul]] of 1312 DR, ''Kegsplitter'' was traded to the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]] in exchange for food and supplies for Shaengarne Ford to survive on for the following season. The axe ended up being available for purchase from [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in her trading company's store in [[Targos]]."
