'''''Despair of Athkatla''''' was a unique fancifully-adorned [[enchanted]] [[wizard]]'s [[staff]] created and wielded by [[Lorroakan]] of [[Athkatla]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The staff possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that made its physical attacks stronger and guided the wielder's arm towards the targets. Additionally, ''Despair of Athkatla'' harnessed its creator's short temper and flooded the wielder's mind with bright shades of burgundy and carmine, focusing their magic into [[spell]] resistance and boosting their spell-slinging aim.

==History==
''Despair of Athkatla'' was created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when it was wielded by the mage Lorroakan, the master of [[Ramazith's tower]] and the [[Sorcerous Sundries]] shop of [[Baldur's Gate]].
