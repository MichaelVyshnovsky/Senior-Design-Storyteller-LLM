'''Nimpeth wine''' was one of the most valuable and finest [[wine]]s in the [[Vilhon Reach]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Nimpeth wine was a sweet variety of wine created in the [[Woren Vineyards]], an agricultural wonder of the Nimpeth, owned by the city's Lord [[Woren]]. The price of Nimpeth wine increased the further one traveled away from the point of its origin, and due to its quality and popularity, it was in high demand.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Nimpeth wine shipments were among the favorite things to shop on for the huge [[dragon turtle]] that inhabited the waters of the [[Deepwash]]. During the same period of time, Nimpeth wine was a common "greetings gift" in [[Turmish]], the tradition that dictated that a visitor was to bring a gift for the host as gratitude for their hospitality.
