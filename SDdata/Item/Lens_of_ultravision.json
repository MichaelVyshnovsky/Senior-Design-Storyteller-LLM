        "Description": "These lenses were fashioned from flawless, pale [[aquamarine]] [[gem]]s. They had many facets and a prismatic quality to them. They were roughly {{SI|1'05.\"|ft-in}} in diameter.",
        "Powers": "When held up to the eye, the wielder of a ''lens of ultravision'' could sense radiation in the [[ultravision|ultraviolet spectrum]]. This allowed them to see within areas of total darkness, as though they were bathed in the bright light of [[Selûne (moon)|selûne]]. Anything within {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} of them could be seen clearly, while general outlines could be distinguished from as far away as {{SI|240|ft|long=yes}} away.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1357 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">While the exact year is not stated, [[Pwyll Daggerford]] became Duke after his father's death in the [[First Dragonspear War]] of [[1356 DR]]. the leader of a band of [[bugbear]]s in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] region that had been driven from the [[Misty Forest]] possessed one of these."
