'''Purskul Platter''' was an aptly named dish from the city of [[Purskul]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
Purskul Platter was a preposterous collection of [[pheasant]] and [[grouse]] meat, as well as [[smoked beef]] served drenched in [[gravy]]. The meats were mostly very handily ready for consumption, with no carving required.

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Purskul Platter was available from the [[Stargath House]] of hospitality that offered little comfort yet served fantastic quality fare.
