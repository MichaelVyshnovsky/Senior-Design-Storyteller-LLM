'''''Shark skin and coral armor''''' was a type of aquatic [[studded leather armor]] crafted by the [[sahuagin]] of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

==Description==
These sets of leather armors were created using [[shark]] skin and extremely hard [[coral]] studs. The design was aimed specifically at aquatic humanoids. All those not used to underwater life felt rigid, restricted, and clumsy while wrapped in these shark leathers. Unlike other mundane types of studded leathers, ''shark skin and coral armor'' also gave the wearers additional protection from fire and acid.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, these types of armor were rarely seen on any other creatures apart from sahuagin of the Sea of Moving Ice.
