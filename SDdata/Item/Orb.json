        "mainbody": "'''Orbs''' were a type of [[arcane magic|arcane]] implement used by spellcasters to focus their spells.",
        "Description": "Orbs all shared their spherical shape, though many were constructed from different materials or were different colors.",
        "Powers": "The primary use of orbs was to channel the spellcasting powers of [[arcane]] spellcasters such as [[bard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[warlock]]s or [[wizard]]s, aiding them when casting their spells. By doing so, someone using an orb as a spellcasting focus could eschew most of the more ordinary [[material component]]s required for a spell.\n\nSome orbs had powers that varied wildly, though many were typically [[psychic]] in nature, allowing wizards to attack the mind of their foes or to see into places beyond sight. Some could be used to ''[[identify]]'' [[magic item]]s.<ref>"
