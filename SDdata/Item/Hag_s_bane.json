        "mainbody": "Hags bane was a rare and valuable potion that could interrupt a hags reproductive cycle and save the child consumed in the process.\nThe potion was prepared using the ashes of a species of plant found growing in the Feywild, aptly named fey flower, which was identifiable by a notable aroma of honeysuckle, eucalyptus, crocus, and cyclamen. The ashes were mined with certain types of alchemical essences and bottled in bottles to be thrown at a hag in battle. Its topical application was enough to immediately force the hag to disgorge a child she consumed to birth a daughter.\nThe hags bane potions originated from the realm of Prismeer, ruled by Iggwilv. The land had a history of being plagued by hags, and the potion was developed as a way to stop the creatures from consuming the children and the power inherent to their innocence. In the , several dried fey flowers were assembled by the members of the Anti-Hag Support Group after finding the recipe in a tome that bore the same name as the potion. It was to be used against the green hag that called herself Auntie Ethel in the city of Baldurs Gate after the hag swallowed a local child called Vanra. The potion may had been used to successfully save the childs life by the members of the Anti-Hag Support Group and the Absolute Adversaries."
