        "mainbody": "'''''Hag's bane''''' was a rare and valuable [[potion]] that could interrupt a [[hag]]'s reproductive cycle and save the child consumed in the process.",
        "Powers": "The potion was prepared using the ashes of a species of plant found growing in the [[Feywild]], aptly named [[fey flower]], which was identifiable by a notable aroma of [[honeysuckle]], [[eucalyptus]], [[crocus]], and [[cyclamen]]. The ashes were mined with certain types of alchemical essences and bottled in bottles to be thrown at a hag in battle. Its topical application was enough to immediately force the hag to disgorge a child she consumed to birth a daughter.",
        "History": "The ''hag's bane'' potions originated from the realm of [[Prismeer]], ruled by [[Iggwilv]]. The land had a history of being plagued by hags, and the potion was developed as a way to stop the creatures from consuming the children and the power inherent to their innocence. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, several dried fey flowers were assembled by the members of the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]] after finding the recipe in a tome that bore the ''[[The Hag's Bane|same name]]'' as the potion. It was to be used against the [[green hag]] that called herself [[Auntie Ethel]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] after the hag swallowed a local child called [[Vanra]]. The potion may had been used to successfully save the child's life by the members of the Anti-Hag Support Group and the [[Absolute Adversaries]]."
