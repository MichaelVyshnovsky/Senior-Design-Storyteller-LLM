        "mainbody": "'''Plangent crystal''' was a magically animated mineral mined in [[Durpar]]. It was used by the [[Datharathi]] in the construction of [[prostheses]]. It was purple, lavender, or puce in hue; the Datharati claimed prosthetics built from it were better than the original limb, and they also controlled all access to it. Those who were grafted with such a prosthetic were called [[plangent]]s.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|118}}",
        "Appearance": "While plangent crystal was a number of shades of purple{{cite book/Lady of Poison|90|10}} Throughout the year 1374 DR, many plangent crystal objects displayed a dark discoloration on their center, attributed to Pandorym's influence.",
        "History": "Plangent crystal, also known as '''Datharati crystal''', was actually a form of matter found in the [[Celestial Nadir]], known to [[Ususi Manaallin]] and the [[Deep Imaskari]] as '''Celestial Nadir crystal'''. Ususi Manaallin's keystone for accessing the Celestial Nadir was made from this crystal; she had found it sold as Datharathi crystal at Two Stars.{{cite book/Darkvision|13|2}}\n\nAround {{yearlink|1370}}, plangent crystal was mined exclusively from under [[Adama's Tooth]].{{cite book/Darkvision|29|3}} Shaddon continued to improve on the process of construction of plangents, and only five years after that, in {{yearlink|1372}}, he developed a new method to create plangent prosthetics that made them actually superior to real flesh.Given that early prototypes were outside Shaddon's control, and only Warian's arm was in that group, this article assumes no plangent implants were sold before 1372 DR, when Shaddon stumbled upon the method to upgrade his implants using Pandorym's power. and two years later, by {{yearlink|1374}}, plangents were common in the city of [[Vaelan]]{{cite book/Darkvision|64|7}} and all but two members of the family, Eined and Zeltaebar Datharati, had replaced at least some parts of their bodies with crystal in order to show they stood behind their work.{{cite book/Darkvision|99-101|10}}\n\nUnknown to everyone but Shaddon himself, by 1372 DR the crystal was no longer mined from Adama's Tooth, but from the Celestial Nadir, accessible through a portal. With the superior crystal, he had been able to improve on his prosthetics to the point of making them better than normal limbs, and also gained the power to control and spy on all plangents. Unfortunately, the source of power for all those improved prosthetics had turned out to be sentient: an [[Elder Evil]] known as [[Pandorym]], who was in turn capable of controlling Shaddon after the latter replaced most of his body with plangent crystal. Only Warian's prototype arm, fashioned from lesser crystal, was still immune to both his grandfather's control and Pandorym's.{{cite book/Darkvision|155-157|16}} The superior crystal was likely acquired from close to the place where Pandorym's body was stored.{{cite book/Darkvision|239|25}}",
        "Uses": "The crystal in its natural state was the material for Warian Datharathi's arm implant,{{cite book/Darkvision|113|11}}\n\nShaddon's upgraded crystal, however, allowed him to puppeteer anyone implanted with it, and granted Pandorym access to anyone who wore that crystal{{cite book/Darkvision|74-75|8}} Pandorym could even teleport monsters to its vicinity, as it did with both Thormud and Ususi, sending strange monsters to the first{{cite book/Darkvision|135|14}} and [[shadow eft]]s to the other.{{cite book/Darkvision|157-159|17}} Pandorym's influence was sometimes visible as a darkness at the center of the crystals; unmodified crystals bore a similar tell, but both Warian{{cite book/Darkvision|239|25}} and Ususi{{cite book/Darkvision|245|26}} observed that unmodified crystal did not immediately operate as a gateway for its influence even if taken from the seam within the Celestial Nadir. More disturbingly, those under the Elder Evil's control who were separated from the crystal perished on the spot.{{cite book/Darkvision|48-49|5}}{{cite book/Darkvision|246|26}}{{cite book/Darkvision|307|31}}\n\nShaddon Datharati also created several [[spider|spiders]] grafted with the crystal.{{cite book/Darkvision|204|21}} Several creatures throughout Vaelan had also been embedded with fragments of the crystal, putting them under Pandorym's control.{{cite book/Darkvision|42|5}} Monsters in the Imperial Weapons Cache were also embedded with, or carried, plangent crystal; during its battle with Ususi's party in the Cache, Pandorym made use of several Deep Imaskari who were under the crystal's influence as well.{{cite book/Darkvision|307|30}}",
        "Rumors": "It was said that [[Curna emerald|Curna emeralds]] might have had traces of plangent crystal in them.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|129}}"
