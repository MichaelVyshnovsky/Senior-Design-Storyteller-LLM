        "mainbody": "Plangent crystal was a magically animated mineral mined in Durpar. It was used by the Datharathi in the construction of prostheses. It was purple, lavender, or puce in hue the Datharati claimed prosthetics built from it were better than the original limb, and they also controlled all access to it. Those who were grafted with such a prosthetic were called plangents. \nWhile plangent crystal was a number of shades of purple Throughout the year 1374 DR, many plangent crystal objects displayed a dark discoloration on their center, attributed to Pandoryms influence.\nPlangent crystal, also known as Datharati crystal, was actually a form of matter found in the Celestial Nadir, known to Ususi Manaallin and the Deep Imaskari as Celestial Nadir crystal. Ususi Manaallins keystone for accessing the Celestial Nadir was made from this crystal she had found it sold as Datharathi crystal at Two Stars.\nAround , plangent crystal was mined exclusively from under Adamas Tooth. Shaddon continued to improve on the process of construction of plangents, and only five years after that, in , he developed a new method to create plangent prosthetics that made them actually superior to real flesh.Given that early prototypes were outside Shaddons control, and only Warians arm was in that group, this article assumes no plangent implants were sold before 1372 DR, when Shaddon stumbled upon the method to upgrade his implants using Pandoryms power. and two years later, by , plangents were common in the city of Vaelan and all but two members of the family, Eined and Zeltaebar Datharati, had replaced at least some parts of their bodies with crystal in order to show they stood behind their work.\nUnknown to everyone but Shaddon himself, by 1372 DR the crystal was no longer mined from Adamas Tooth, but from the Celestial Nadir, accessible through a portal. With the superior crystal, he had been able to improve on his prosthetics to the point of making them better than normal limbs, and also gained the power to control and spy on all plangents. Unfortunately, the source of power for all those improved prosthetics had turned out to be sentient an Elder Evil known as Pandorym, who was in turn capable of controlling Shaddon after the latter replaced most of his body with plangent crystal. Only Warians prototype arm, fashioned from lesser crystal, was still immune to both his grandfathers control and Pandoryms. The superior crystal was likely acquired from close to the place where Pandoryms body was stored.\nThe crystal in its natural state was the material for Warian Datharathis arm implant,\nShaddons upgraded crystal, however, allowed him to puppeteer anyone implanted with it, and granted Pandorym access to anyone who wore that crystal Pandorym could even teleport monsters to its vicinity, as it did with both Thormud and Ususi, sending strange monsters to the first and shadow efts to the other. Pandoryms influence was sometimes visible as a darkness at the center of the crystals unmodified crystals bore a similar tell, but both Warian and Ususi observed that unmodified crystal did not immediately operate as a gateway for its influence even if taken from the seam within the Celestial Nadir. More disturbingly, those under the Elder Evils control who were separated from the crystal perished on the spot.\nShaddon Datharati also created several spiders grafted with the crystal. Several creatures throughout Vaelan had also been embedded with fragments of the crystal, putting them under Pandoryms control. Monsters in the Imperial Weapons Cache were also embedded with, or carried, plangent crystal during its battle with Ususis party in the Cache, Pandorym made use of several Deep Imaskari who were under the crystals influence as well.\nIt was said that Curna emeralds might have had traces of plangent crystal in them."
