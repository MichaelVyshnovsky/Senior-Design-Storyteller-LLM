It was one of the only two ways that such a thing could be achieved in Mobius Tower.\nThe Medallion of Time was worn by the Guardian of Time inside Mobius Tower. Adventurers may have used it to remove the crystal minaret required by Marteks trials, but the Guardian would not have given it up without a fight.\n*Guardian of Time"
