        "Powers": "''Inconsequence'' possessed a powerful ''+3'' enchantment that became a drastically more powerful version of itself, a ''+5'' enchantment, when wielded against both evil and good creatures.",
        "History": "However powerful this warhammer was, its creator exclusively used it to knock on the doors of temples and churches, which he called \"the dens of fools and mindless men\". Phellep, the prophet of providential rejection, believed that no-one's individual actions bore any relevance nor effect on the faith of [[human]]ity as a whole. He rejected such concepts as good and evil, and ''Inconsequence'' reflected his beliefs.\n\nEventually, by [[1281 DR]], ''Inconsequence'' left the hands of its creator and ended up in the possession of [[Quinn Silverfinger]], a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] from [[Lonelywood]] of the [[Ten Towns]]."
