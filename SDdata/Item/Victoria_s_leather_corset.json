        "mainbody": "'''''Victoria's leather corset''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[elf|elven]] [[leather armor]] that once belonged to an [[Akh'Velahr]] war party leader, [[Victoria]], who died in the [[Weeping War]].",
        "Description": "''Victoria's leather corset'' was a tight-fitting leather sheath.",
        "Powers": "This leather [[corset]] was enhanced with elven magics with a ''+2'' enchantment. It also dramatically increased the wearer's charisma at the cost of somewhat reduced fortitude. Additionally, the leathers allowed the wearer to cast ''[[dominate person]]'' at will. ''Victoria's leather corset'' held six charges of the spell.",
        "History": "During the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading [[Army of Darkness]] and met her demise in the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victoria's gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. ''Victoria's leather corset'' never reached the [[Underdark]] as a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs."
