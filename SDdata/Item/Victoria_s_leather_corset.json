        "mainbody": "Victorias leather corset was a unique enchanted elven leather armor that once belonged to an AkhVelahr war party leader, Victoria, who died in the Weeping War.\nVictorias leather corset was a tight-fitting leather sheath.\nThis leather corset was enhanced with elven magics with a +2 enchantment. It also dramatically increased the wearers charisma at the cost of somewhat reduced fortitude. Additionally, the leathers allowed the wearer to cast dominate person at will. Victorias leather corset held six charges of the spell.\nDuring the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading Army of Darkness and met her demise in the Elven Catacombs. In 1369 DR, the drow of House Freth were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victorias gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. Victorias leather corset never reached the Underdark as a group of adventurers from Phlan destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs."
