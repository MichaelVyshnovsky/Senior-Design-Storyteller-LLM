        "mainbody": "he Tome of Ascendance was an artifact spellbook that once belonged to the agents of the Cloaked Ascendancy during their assault on Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.\nWhen a mage cast spells from the Tome of Ascendance, they were changed and gained additional properties. One of the four changes happened whatever the spell was, it left behind an area of effect of four types â€“ an aboleth, a fey, a fireforged, or an illusion. When a friendly creature passed through one of these areas, they were consumed by the books magic, granting the wielder of the Tome of Ascendance a special ability depending on the area that consumed a creature. If the area of effect was an aboleth, all of the wizards attacks, be they physical or magical, gained the ability to spread plague if it were fey, the mage received less damage, their movement speed increased, and they healed if the effect was a fireforged, all creatures around the mage were enveloped in chains and pulled towards them whilst the mages attacks, both spells and physical, were boosted and lastly, if the area was an illusion, the casters speed was boosted and they received the boon of becoming stealthy and hid from their enemies.\nThe Tome of Ascendance was recovered from the wreckage of Neverwinters Blacklake District in the late 15 century DR. It was brought there by one of the wizards of the Cloaked Ascendancy and was believed to hide a number of dangerous and exotic spells."
