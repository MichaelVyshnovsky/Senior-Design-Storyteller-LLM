        "mainbody": "The '''''Tome of Ascendance''''' was an [[artifact]] ''[[spellbook]]'' that once belonged to the agents of the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]] during their assault on [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "When a mage cast [[spell]]s from the ''Tome of Ascendance,'' they were changed and gained additional properties. One of the four changes happened: whatever the spell was, it left behind an area of effect of four types â€“ an [[aboleth]], a [[fey]], a [[fireforged]], or an [[illusion]]. When a friendly creature passed through one of these areas, they were consumed by the book's magic, granting the wielder of the ''Tome of Ascendance'' a special ability depending on the area that consumed a creature. If the area of effect was an aboleth, all of the wizard's attacks, be they physical or magical, gained the ability to spread [[plague]]; if it were fey, the mage received less damage, their movement speed increased, and they healed; if the effect was a fireforged, all creatures around the mage were enveloped in chains and pulled towards them whilst the mage's attacks, both spells and physical, were boosted; and lastly, if the area was an illusion, the caster's speed was boosted and they received the boon of becoming stealthy and hid from their enemies.",
        "History": "The ''Tome of Ascendance'' was recovered from the wreckage of Neverwinter's [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. It was brought there by one of the [[wizard]]s of the Cloaked Ascendancy and was believed to hide a number of dangerous and exotic spells."
