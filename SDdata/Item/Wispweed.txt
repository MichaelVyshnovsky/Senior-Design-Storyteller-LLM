Wispweed was the name of a swamp plant that resembled hair. Legend claimed that the plant was made of the hair that had been lost by travelers who perished beneath the waters of bogs.
It was collected in bundles that appeared to be woven together.
Despite its gruesome folklore origins, wispweed was said to be mostly harmless.
Wispweed could be processed through alchemy into sublimate. When the sublimate of wispweed was mixed with certain types of ashes, it formed the base of a potion of glorious vaulting.
