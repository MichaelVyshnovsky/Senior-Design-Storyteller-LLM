'''Wispweed''' was the name of a swamp plant that resembled hair. Legend claimed that the plant was made of the hair that had been lost by travelers who perished beneath the waters of bogs.

==Description==
It was collected in bundles that appeared to be woven together.

==Reputation==
Despite its gruesome folklore origins, wispweed was said to be mostly harmless.

===Usages===
Wispweed could be processed through alchemy into sublimate. When the sublimate of wispweed was mixed with certain types of ashes, it formed the base of a ''[[potion of glorious vaulting]]''.
