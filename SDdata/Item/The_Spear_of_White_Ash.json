        "mainbody": "The Spear of White Ash was an enchanted Malarite spear used in High Hunts.\nThis crude enchanted polearm was a single piece of ash wood with a primitive but cruel-looking spearhead.\nThe Spear of White Ash possessed a +3 enchantment and upon a successful strike it could deal increasingly severe additional damage to the target on each following hit.\nThe Spear of White Ash was created several hundreds of years before 1281 DR by devotees of Malar, the Lord of the Hunt, for the use in his holy High Hunts. The last known owner of the spear was Old Hunter Wellin, who was said to have perished hunting dryads of Cloak Wood to the south of Baldurs Gate.\nEventually, by 1281 DR, the Giant Killer found its way into the stock of Conlan, the proprietor of Kuldahars blacksmith shop."
