        "mainbody": "Orvas was an insinuated or ingested poison.\nOrvas was a bittersweet-tasting liquid with a translucent green tint.\nOrvas was poisonous if ingested, but usually it was introduced directly into the bloodstream via a wound. It caused immediate damage upon entering the bloodstream and for a short time thereafter. If ingested, the poison damage was delayed for several hours. Orvas was effective against any mammal.\nOrvas was an antidote to varrakas if it was insinuated into the bloodstream before the poisonous effects of varrakas could take place.\nOrvas was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage Lethchauntos the Black, during his time spent with an orc tribe in the 10 century DR. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists before the midâ€“14 century DR."
