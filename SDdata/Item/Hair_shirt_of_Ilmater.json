        "mainbody": "hair shirt of Ilmater, also known as a hair shirt of suffering, was a magical horsehair shirt associated with the faith of the god Ilmater, the One Who Endures.\nIt was, as the name suggested, a thick shirt fashioned of several layers of coarse, brown woven horsehair, making quite a stiff fabric. These hair shirts were typically quite ragged.\nAlthough the thick and uncomfortable hair shirt impeded the wearers agility, it was thick enough to provide a high degree of protection against attacks to the wearer. Some later, cheaper versions caused no significant impediment, but only provided slight protection.\nThe magical hair shirt allowed the wearer to cast cure serious wounds once a day, but only on someone other than the wearer, in accordance with the teachings of Ilmater.\nIn addition to the woven horsehair, a hair shirt required the spells barkskin and cure serious wounds.\nThese hair shirts were typically only fashioned and worn by the followers of Ilmater. They preferred to use the shirts healing power to alleviate the suffering of others."
