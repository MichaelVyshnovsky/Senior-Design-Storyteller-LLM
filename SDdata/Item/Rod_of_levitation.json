        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of levitation''''' was an enchanted [[rod]] that could make objects or beings float in the air. A '''''rod of antilevitation''''' would stop such effects.{{Cite dragon/124/Sailors on the Sea of Air|19}}",
        "Description": "''Rods of levitation'' consisted of three parts: the central shaft, and two short, hollow cylinders that covered its ends. The cylinders were often custom-painted to distinguish one end from the other. Both ends could be twisted and then slid down the shaft toward the center. One end augmented the ''[[levitate]]'' spell, while the other augmented the opposite effect, ''i.e.'', ''anti-levitate''. The further each rod end was revealed, the greater the effect.\n\nSome rods appeared to only have a single end, and thus only had one effect or the other. For example, rods with only the anti-levitation end were known as ''rods of ''anti''levitation''.",
        "Reputation": "''Rods of levitation'' were used among [[Halruaan skyship|skyship]] captains, to keep their ships afloat. A dexterous captain with a fully charged rod could make their skyships dive or climb. Even more skilled individuals could jump off large heights without taking damage by aiming such a rod in the right direction, as they fell to the ground. By balancing out the revealed ends, individuals could appear to walk on air. ''Rods of antilevitation'', however, were used by those who ventured into the depths of the [[Underdark]], mainly to combat levitating [[drow]]."
