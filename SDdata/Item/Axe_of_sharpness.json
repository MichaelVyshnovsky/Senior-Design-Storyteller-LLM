        "Powers": "A blow from an ''axe of sharpness'' always drew more blood than a blow from a regular axe. In addition, the wielder could sometime pull off a maneuver to sweep cleanly into an enemy, wounding them massively and leaving them struggling to defend themselves from subsequent attacks.",
