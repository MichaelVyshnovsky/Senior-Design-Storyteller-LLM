        "mainbody": "'''Stuffed giant squid''' was a specialty dish found in the town of [[Tulmene]] in [[Tethyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Meals to remember; long live the Tower!''|[[Volothamp Geddarm]]}}",
        "Description": "Despite any presumptions one might make from the dish's name, the [[giant squid]] itself was actually an inedible hard brown shell. However, its stuffing was the star of the dish. The giant squid shell was filled to the brim with a variety of [[crab]]s, several types of [[smoked fish]], whole [[onion]]s, [[lime]]s, minced [[pork]], and well-spiced brown sauces. The aromatic dish's size was indeed impressiveâ€”the platter it came on was as long as a short [[human]].",
        "History": "The best way to taste the impressive stuffed giant squid was special-ordering it from [[Tulmene's Tower]] inn and its cook [[Julda]] in the 1360s DR. The special dish was for special occasions and truly impressed [[Volothamp Geddarm]], enough for him to give Tulmene's Tower his highest ratings in the guide to [[Amn]] and Tethyr he penned."
