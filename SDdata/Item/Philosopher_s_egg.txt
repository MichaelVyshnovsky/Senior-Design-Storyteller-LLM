A philosophers egg was an enchanted piece of glassware that aided in the creation of magical fluids such as potions.
These magical retorts aided in making magical and mundane fluids by halving the time needed to make them. A philosophers egg was also a material component in the process of creating gold from lead.
Khenel Barony, a wizard from Waterdeep, owned a philosophers egg.
