'''''A History of Draconic Interactions''''' was a book that compiled [[human]] knowledge about [[dragon]]s. The book had very detailed facts about dragon society, including a section about the ''[[Xorvintaal]]''.

==History==
When the former [[blue dragon]] [[Clytemorrenestrix]] read the book, in [[1479 DR]], she said that most of the knowledge compiled in that book was not only inaccurate but also illogical from the perspective of dragons.
