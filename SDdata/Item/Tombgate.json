        "mainbody": "ombgate was a portal spanning Tsarn Tombs and Eveningstar.\nOne end of the gate was at Eveningstar Gorge just a little way from Eveningstar itself. It led to Tsarn Tombs near Scornubel.\nIn , Tessaril Winter took Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith through the portal in disguise. They arrived at Tsarn Tombs near Scornubel, atop a hill, within sight of a road leading to a ferry.\nThe portal was known to the Zhentarim scriers Korthauvar Hammantle and Hlael Toraunt, who, by eavesdropping on a group of Highknights, confirmed Tessaril had went with two people through a portal, and sent a skull-token elsewhere. The portal was already known to them to have been used by Tessaril and two companions.\nTessaril later informed Lhaeo which portal she used and sent a skull token that would teleport one to the same location.\nHlael Toraunt thought Hesperdan would know where Tombgate led."
