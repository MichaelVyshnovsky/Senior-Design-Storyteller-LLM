'''Star rose quartz''' was a smoky pink quartz which had an [[wikipedia:en:asterism (gemmology)|asterism]].

==Description==
When cut cabochon, star rose quartz reflected or transmitted light in a star-like pattern. It was used as a centerpiece in modest jewelry, like pectorals and earrings, worn mainly by the matrons of long-established houses. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.

==Powers==
While carrying or wearing one of these stones, the star rose quartz had a chance to deflect a spell directed at the bearer. Because of this property, this [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] was an alternate spell component for all [[abjuration]] spells and any divine magic of the [[Protection sphere|protection sphere]] that could use a material component that wasn't specially prepared for a particular spell.
