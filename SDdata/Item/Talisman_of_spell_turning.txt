'''''Talismans of spell turning''''' were [[talisman]]s that protected a wearer against magical attacks and reflected those [[spell]]s back at the caster.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}

==Description==
''Talsimans of spell turning'' were crafted from [[silver]], [[iris agate]], and crushed [[dragon]] bone. They weighed about a pound (half a kilogram) and would sell in most markets of [[Faer√ªn]] for around 2,800 [[gold piece]]s. They emitted a moderate [[abjuration]] aura to those who could [[detect magic|detect]] such things.

==Powers==
When the wearer of one of these ''talismans'' pressed it to bare skin, the magic would offer protection as soon as the wearer was targeted by an attacker's spell. The talisman would then crumble to dust, and for one minute, the talisman's resonating field would reflect back between one and five low-powered and targeted ranged spells.

==Creation==
Fabrication of such a talisman required the creator to know the spell ''[[lesser spell turning]]''.

==History==
''Talsimans of spell turning'' were invented by the [[adept]]s, [[witch doctor]]s, and [[shaman]]s of the [[Thousand Fists]] tribe of [[orc]]s from the [[Nether Mountains]]. When the [[Nethertide Horde]] sought to plunder the city of [[Silverymoon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1343}}, the ''talismans'' allowed the orcs to survive many of the spells from the ambushing [[wizard]]s of the [[Moonlight Men]] in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]]. (The Moonlight Men were ultimately victorious, however.)

Afterward, the [[cambion]] [[Kaanyr Vhok]] learned the secrets of the ''talismans''' creation, and he and his bands of [[tanarukk]]a actively began to spread the knowledge of how to craft them to other tribes in other mountains&mdash;such as the [[Rauvin Mountains]] and the [[Greypeak Mountains|Greypeaks]]&mdash;and in the [[Fallen Lands]].
