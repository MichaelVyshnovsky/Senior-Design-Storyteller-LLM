        "mainbody": "'''Fruitcake''' was a sweet [[bread]] studded with dried fruits and nuts and flavored with [[rum]] or [[brandy]] made on the [[Pirate Isles]]. It was available for purchase across [[Faer√ªn]] through [[Aurora's Emporium]].",
        "Description": "Dried fruits used commonly in fruitcakes included [[date]]s, [[citron]], [[currant]]s, [[raisin]]s, and [[cherry|cherries]], as well as nuts such as walnuts, hazelnuts and filberts.\n\nWhen purchased through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', fruitcakes were shipped in a decorative tin.",
        "Reputation": "It was rumored that, if aged for too long, fruitcakes would become so hard and heavy that they could be used as weapons."
