        "mainbody": "ruitcake was a sweet bread studded with dried fruits and nuts and flavored with rum or brandy made on the Pirate Isles. It was available for purchase across Faer√ªn through Auroras Emporium.\nDried fruits used commonly in fruitcakes included dates, citron, currants, raisins, and cherries, as well as nuts such as walnuts, hazelnuts and filberts.\nWhen purchased through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, fruitcakes were shipped in a decorative tin.\nIt was rumored that, if aged for too long, fruitcakes would become so hard and heavy that they could be used as weapons."
