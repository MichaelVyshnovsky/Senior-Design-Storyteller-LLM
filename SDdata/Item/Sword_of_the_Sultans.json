        "mainbody": "The Sword of the Sultans was an enchanted blade that once belonged to a ruler of a distant realm, far east from the Sword Coast.\nThe Sword of the Sultans was enhanced with a +1 enchantment and given a magically sharp keen edge. The bearer of this longsword also became more vulnerable to certain conditions and magics that created cold.\nThis blade came from somewhere far to the east of the Sword Coast. Much of its history remained unknown, apart from the fact that the sword was procured by Lashar‎‎, a merchant of Liams Hold, some time in or shortly before 1372 DR. The half-orc merchant appreciated rare, exotic, and beautiful items of unique designs and far-off lands, but he was glad to part with the Sword of the Sultans for a price."
