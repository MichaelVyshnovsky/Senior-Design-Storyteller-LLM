An '''''orb of duo-dimension''''' was an orb that was used in surface raids by the [[drow]].

==Description==
The orbs' surfaces were&mdash;except on the side they were held by&mdash; pierced with holes. Inside these orbs were the ashes of a drow.

==Powers==
An ''orb of duo-dimension's'' contents could be shaken out on saying the [[command word]] that unsealed the orb's holes. These holes were sealed with invisible [[magic]]al force, which the command word made relax.

By shaking the contents out on a mammalian creature, the creature was under the effect of a ''[[duo-dimension]]'' [[spell]] for seven minutes. The effect took one minute to manifest and was accompanied by a tingling sensation.

==History==
The ''orb of duo-dimension'' was a [[magic item]] associated with the drow. They used it in their surface raids or sneak attacks in the [[Underdark]]. To put simply, they used it every time they wanted to navigate through narrow caverns without opening up big tunnels, which their enemies could use against them.

On his first surface raid, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] was put under the effect of an ''orb of duo-dimension'' to enter the surface.
