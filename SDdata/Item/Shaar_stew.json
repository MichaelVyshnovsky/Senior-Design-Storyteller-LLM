A thick, brown broth formed the base and boiled tubers and leafy greens completed the dish. It was served in a bowl made from a round loaf of bread with a hard crust, or ladled into a customers metal cup or helmet. A serving of Shaar stew at Mother Talaskos cost one to two silver pieces, depending on the cost of the ingredients."
