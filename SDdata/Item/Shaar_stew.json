        "Description": "The meat in Shaar stew was somewhat of a mystery but was usually a mixture of old [[horse]] and [[ox]]en that were long past their prime, vermin trapped on the plains, and [[rothé]], cut into small cubes and strips, rubbed with hot [[spices]], and seared in a [[pan]]. A thick, brown [[broth]] formed the base and boiled tubers and leafy greens completed the dish. It was served in a [[bowl]] made from a round loaf of [[bread]] with a hard crust, or [[ladle]]d into a customer's metal [[cup]] or [[helmet]]. A serving of Shaar stew at Mother Talasko's cost one to two [[silver piece]]s, depending on the cost of the ingredients."
