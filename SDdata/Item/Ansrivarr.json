Its name is the [[Elven language|elvish]] word for \"memory\". After Mondar's death, the sword was taken by [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]].\n\nIt was used actively by Faerlthann and his sons, but beyond this it became a ceremonial sword, used only during coronations. [[Baerauble Etharr]] and [[Alea Dahast]] wove magical enchantments into the sword that made it very nearly invulnerable.",
