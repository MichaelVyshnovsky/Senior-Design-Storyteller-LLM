'''Tankards''' were a kind of drinking vessel found in the [[Realms]], resembling large and heavy [[mug]]s.

|Aargh, look at these [[fork]]s and tankards! This iron shortage shows no mercy on us drunkards and gourmands!<br/>
They be made of [[iron]] yet they bend under the weight of this inn's meager offerings and the handle breaks on me tankard to spill this rat spit of an [[ale]] into my lap! Aarrr, [[Nessie]], get me another!
|[[Whelp]], during the [[iron crisis]]}}
==Description==
Tankards were large and solid compared to most [[cup]]s. They came with a sturdy handle, allowing them to hold large servings of [[ale]], [[beer]], and other drinks.

A '''talltankard''' was an enormous tankard that could hold twice as much as regular tankards, and had a lid on top.

==Notable Tankards==
[[File:5mugs.jpg|quality|left|''A sign of quality.'']]
[[Volo's rating system]] used a scale of 1â€“5 tankards to rate the service of a tavern that he visited.

Magical tankards either applied an effect to what was poured into it, or produced their own magical drink:
* ''[[Charname's Tankard]]''
* ''[[Battle Tankard]]''
* ''[[Hero's chalice]]''{{Cite card/Spellfire: Master the Magic/Forgotten Realms Chase|9/25}}
* ''[[Tankard of sobriety]]''
* ''[[Thrice hearty cup of Balder the Red]]''{{Cite card/Spellfire: Master the Magic/Forgotten Realms Chase|1/25}}

==Trivia==
* In the [[Roll of Years]], the year [[1370 DR]] bore the name "Year of the Tankard".<ref>
