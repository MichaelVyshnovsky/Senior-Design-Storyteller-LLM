        "mainbody": "Everbountiful soup kettles were a type of enchanted metal kettle.\nThese kettles were large enough to hold around .\nAny water, or other non-poisonous liquid, poured into this kettle would be transformed into steaming and nutritious vegetable soup. One full kettle could provide enough food for up to six people of normal appetites. This effect could be used once per day.\nIn 1484 DR, a duergar outpost in the Northdark, near the cavern that Matharic haunted, had a cauldron variant of this item that required the command word \"Kotark\" to be spoken. Said cauldron also had the word engraved on its underside in Dethek.\n* Solimar, a chef and wizard at the Ravens Bluff restaurant The Painted Boat, owned an everbountiful soup kettle.\n* Goldeyes, the specialty priests of Waukeen, had a chance of receiving an everbountiful soup kettle as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy."
