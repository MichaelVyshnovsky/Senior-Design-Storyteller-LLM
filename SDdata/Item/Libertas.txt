==Description==
''Libertas'' was a long and thin pike weapon that was decorated with intricate elven designs. It was designed for two-handed use, and was too big to be thrown effectively.

In [[1369 DR]], ''Libertas'' was found in possession of a group of [[orog]]s that tried too claim a part of the ruined city of Myth Drannor for themselves. The pike itself was looted from one of many fallen heroes of the City of Song in the [[Dwarven Dungeons]].
