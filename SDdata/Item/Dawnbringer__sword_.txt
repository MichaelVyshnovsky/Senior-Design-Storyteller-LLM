'''''Dawnbringer''''' was a sentient ''[[sun blade]].''

==Description==
Lost for ages in the [[Underdark]], ''Dawnbringer'' appeared to be a gilded long sword hilt, but it could create a blade of pure radiance.

==Powers==
In addition to using its radiant blade to deal damage, ''Dawnbringer'' was more effective against [[undead]]. Its radiant blade also emitted bright sunlight in a 15-foot (4.6-meter) radius and dim light for another 15 feet, but these ranges were adjustable. ''Dawnbringer'' also had the ability to cast ''[[lesser restoration]]'' once a day.
