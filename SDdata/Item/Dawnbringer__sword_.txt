Dawnbringer was a sentient sun blade.
Lost for ages in the Underdark, Dawnbringer appeared to be a gilded long sword hilt, but it could create a blade of pure radiance.
In addition to using its radiant blade to deal damage, Dawnbringer was more effective against undead. Its radiant blade also emitted bright sunlight in a 15-foot (4.6-meter) radius and dim light for another 15 feet, but these ranges were adjustable. Dawnbringer also had the ability to cast lesser restoration once a day.
