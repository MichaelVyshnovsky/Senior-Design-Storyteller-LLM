        "mainbody": "'''''The Love of Black Bess''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[mace]] dedicated to the Lady of Misfortune, [[Beshaba]].",
        "Powers": "''The Love of Black Bess'' was enhanced with a powerful ''+3'' enchantment as well as Beshaba's divine magics of bad luck. Each successful hit had a chance of taking away the target's luck. Additionally, the mace's creator attached a ''[[ring of readiness]]'' to the ''Black Bess''. The owner of its twin [[ring]] could summon the mace to fly into their hands with a simple command.",
        "History": "[[Redani]], a cruel [[mage]] who worshiped Beshaba and lived sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, was the creator of ''The Love of Black Bess''. Redani was known for two things: her arcane prowess, and her skills of seduction. The magical mace was a regular gift to the woman's new consorts. Every time Redani grew tired of a lover, she gave a new consort the ''ring of readiness'' and sent him to slay the predecessor. New paramours always slew their mark with ease. A single word sent ''The Love of Black Bess'' flying out of the old lover's hands and into the new one's. Ultimately, Redani's death came from a [[priest]] of [[Hoar]], the god of poetic justice. The said priest was [[Gural]] of [[Chessenta]], who came across a skull of one of Redani's ex-lovers felled by ''The Love of Black Bess'' and embarked on a quest to bring justice to the Beshaban wizardess. Gural animated all of the consorts slain by Redani, ending her cruel existence.\n\n''The Love of Black Bess'' changed hands over time before ending up in possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]] by [[1281 DR]]."
