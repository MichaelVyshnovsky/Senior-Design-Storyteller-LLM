'''''Devil's Doom''''' was a magical [[longsword]] created by the [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]] from [[Daggerford]].

==Powers==
''Devil's Doom'' was a ''+1'' enchanted blade forged out of cold iron and blessed by the priests of Lathander the Morninglord in the first rays of morning sun light. The cold iron and blessing made the sword especially effective against creatures not native to the [[Prime Material plane]]. The blade's enchantment became a ''+2'' when used against outsiders, and dealt additional divine damage.

==History==
Daggerford has had a tumultuous history when it came to the [[devil]]s from the [[Dragonspear Castle]]. This sword was created to effectively combat any extra-planar threats that menaced Daggerford. In [[1372 DR]] ''Devil's Doom'' was in the possession of the cleric of Lathander named [[Liam Sunmist]] of the [[Morninglow Tower]].
