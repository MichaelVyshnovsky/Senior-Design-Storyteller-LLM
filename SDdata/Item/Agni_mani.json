        "mainbody": "'''Agni mani''' was the name given to certain [[wikipedia:en:tektite|tektites]]&mdash;glass-like objects formed when hot [[meteor]]s fell from the sky and struck [[sand]]. They were typically found in [[Anauroch]] and other deserts around [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "Agni mani specifically meant the black variety of these irregularly shaped objects. They were used unmodified in magic items, or bits of them were sewn into garments for their protective quality. A typical specimen had a base value of 10 [[gp]].",
        "Powers": "This gemstone could absorb a small random portion of an explosive blast, such as produced by a ''[[fireball]]'' or ''[[beads of force]]'', vaporizing in the process. Agni manis only protected the being that was carrying or wearing them.",
        "Trivia": "The lesser [[drow]] deity [[Vhaeraun]] was known to occasionally send agni manis to show his favour or disfavour to his followers.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}} Similarly, agni manis were sacred to the [[Chult]]an demigod [[Eshowdow]], and he valued unholy items made from them.<ref>"
