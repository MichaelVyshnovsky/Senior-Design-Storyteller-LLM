Collars of protection were enchanted collars created to keep pets of the wealthy individuals safe. They were first created by a wizard from Ravens Bluff sometime before the late 14 century DR.
Collars of protection were made out of various types of materials, from simple leather thongs to lavishly decorated collars of gems, furs, and chains.
These collars were only of diminutive size, only big enough to be worn by various pets or creatures of a human, halfling, gnome size, or smaller. They also only extended protection to creatures of low animal intelligence. Defensive enchantments of these items carried from +1 to +5.
