        "mainbody": "'''''Woodcutter's axes''''' were [[enchanted]] tools of lumberjacks's trade in the [[Moonsea]] region.",
        "Powers": "These magic ''woodcutter's axes'' were created to increase the work efficiency of individual lumberjacks as hands-on logging was the most efficient method. The enchantments placed on ''woodcutter's axes'' guided the weapon towards the \"sweet spot\" on the target's body. This effectively was a ''+2'' enchantment when wielded in battle. The same magic made these aces especially deadly against various [[shapechanger]] foes.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, ''woodcutter's axes'' were used by lumberjacks in the Moonsea region and the city of [[Voonlar]]. One such weapon could be found stuck in a tree stump on the outskirts of Voonlar ''circa'' the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis and a devastating [[fiend]] assault on the city."
