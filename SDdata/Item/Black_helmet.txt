'''Black helmet''' was a [[wikipedia:en:cassidae|cassidae]] shell found in the Realms.

==Description==
Helmet shells were sought after for making cameos. Black helmet shells had a dark brown layer beneath a lighter colored layer. This gave a cameo an [[onyx]]-like appearance. A large specimen in good condition had a base value of 45 gp.
