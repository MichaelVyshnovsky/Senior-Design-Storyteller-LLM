A '''''driftdisc''''' was a [[magic item]] used for movement.

==Description==
A ''driftdisc'' was a smooth-polished, dark rock disc of 6 feet (1.8 meters) diameter that radiated a faint pearly-white-with-a-greenish-tinge light.

==Powers==
As mentioned above, a ''driftdisc'' was a rock disc. This rock was a special kind of rock mined from ''[[faerzress]]''-rich places. It was so infused with the radiation that it caused some [[spell]]s cast on it as a part of a secret, long, and exacting process to extend in duration. In the ''driftdisc's'' case, the spell was ''[[tenser's floating disc]]'' and the duration was extended to something between two and twelve months. If exposed to sunlight, a ''driftdisc'' lost its power like a ''[[drowcraft]]'' item. By [[1372 DR]], the ''driftdisc'' was improved to withstand sunlight and its effect became permanent. The creation process also changed to the casting of ''[[animate objects]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', and ''[[overland flight]]''. The carrying capacity of a ''driftdisc'' was 300 lb. (136 kg).

''Driftdiscs'' floated at the mental command of the [[wizard]] who cast the spell on the rock disc, provided he was within one mile (1.6 km). By [[1372 DR]], the ''driftdisc'' was improved in that regard, they could be verbally commanded by anyone who knew the [[command word]], which was different from ''driftdisc'' to ''driftdisc''. Without a command, the discs floated about 3 feet (0.9 meters) above a horizontal surface.

The ''driftdisc'' could be equipped with a ''[[drow house insignia]]''. If done so, they conveyed the ability to use the powers stored into the insignia both for or against the one carried by the ''driftdisc''.

A ''driftdisc'' could be put under the effect of an ''animate objects'' spell and made to fight at the command of the user.

==History==
The ''driftdisc'' was a [[magic item]] associated with the [[drow]]. They were used in important ceremonies and other occasions, They used it to carry stuff, starting from cargo to the purchases of a matron's shopping tour, for movement of people, starting from [[chariot]] services to elevator services, for military purpose as firing platforms in temples, or as beds by matrons, the last usage was viewed as a sign of an eccentric trait of the matron. 

==Notable Owners==
[[Yvonnel Baenre]] used a ''driftdisc'' while traveling to [[Mithral Hall]] with the army of [[Menzoberranzan]].
