        "mainbody": "'''''Evaelathil''''' was a magical [[short sword]] for [[halfling]]s and one of the ''[[baneblades of Demron]]'' created in [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "It was a short sword designed for smaller folk such as halflings, weighing 1 pound (0.45 kilograms). When drawn, it glowed as bright as a [[torch]] with a soft green light, but this could be shut off at will.",
        "Powers": "As a ''baneblade of Demron'', it was a ''+4 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]]'' weapon that was a ''[[bane (property)|bane]]'' to both [[undead]] and [[evil]] [[outsider]]s. ''Evaelathil'' in particular bestowed resistance to fire on its wielder and let them use ''[[charm person]]'' and ''[[locate creature]]'' once a day each with command words. However, it was only usable by halflings, and was just a non-magical if well-made sword for anyone else.",
        "History": "''Evaelathil'' was crafted by the archmage [[Demron]] before the fall of Myth Drannor, and is the first of his series of ''baneblades''."
