        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the writer found himself swept away into a plot that crossed the merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]], with whom he was enamored, and an interloper [[deity]] from another world called [[Zehir]]. When the god's [[avatar]] was slain by a group of [[adventurer]]s who worked for Sa'Sani, Volo gifted them this magic ring as a gesture of a personal gratitude."
