        "mainbody": "'''''Spirit arrows''''' were a variety of magical [[arrow]]s made or used by [[barbarian]]s that could penetrate most magical defenses.",
        "Description": "These arrows were rather mundane in appearance, though always had an arrowhead made of white [[flint]].",
        "Powers": "''Spirit arrows'' had the power to outright ignore and pentrate most protective spells, such as ''[[fire shield]]'' ''[[mage armor]]'', or ''[[stoneskin]]''. They also could bypass the magical defenses offered by magical armor or clothing, such as ''[[cloak of protection|cloaks of protection]]'', ''[[bracers of defense]]'', and ''[[ring of protection|rings of protection]]''. Once a ''spirit arrow'' landed, regardless of whether it struck a target or not, they became destroyed.",
        "History": "Sometime in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s in [[Ravens Bluff]] found themselves magically transported by a painting to the land of [[Chult]] when searching for [[Cuthbert Maguluty]]. In order to return home they had to retrieve a magical painting depicting [[Rupertyna Phyneus-Maguluty]]'s cottage that had been stolen by [[ptera-men]]. While at the village of the ptera-men, the adventurers found a small treasure hoard within the hut of their chieftain, containing such items as a ''[[mask of beastliness]]'', ten ''spirit arrows'', sixteen [[emerald]]s, and a [[dagger]] with a solid emerald pommel.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Something Weird is Going On in Late Uncle Rupert's Root Cellar|12-14}}"
