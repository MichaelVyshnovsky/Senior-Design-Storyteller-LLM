        "mainbody": "Spirit arrows were a variety of magical arrows made or used by barbarians that could penetrate most magical defenses.\nThese arrows were rather mundane in appearance, though always had an arrowhead made of white flint.\nSpirit arrows had the power to outright ignore and pentrate most protective spells, such as fire shield mage armor, or stoneskin. They also could bypass the magical defenses offered by magical armor or clothing, such as cloaks of protection, bracers of defense, and rings of protection. Once a spirit arrow landed, regardless of whether it struck a target or not, they became destroyed.\nSometime in the mid-14 century DR, a group of adventurers in Ravens Bluff found themselves magically transported by a painting to the land of Chult when searching for Cuthbert Maguluty. In order to return home they had to retrieve a magical painting depicting Rupertyna Phyneus-Magulutys cottage that had been stolen by ptera-men. While at the village of the ptera-men, the adventurers found a small treasure hoard within the hut of their chieftain, containing such items as a mask of beastliness, ten spirit arrows, sixteen emeralds, and a dagger with a solid emerald pommel."
