Additionally, when worn, ''Sea's Bounty'' glowed in gentle blue radiance, illuminating the area of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} around it.

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} center DR, ''Sea's Bounty'' could be found on the [[Nelanther Isles]] off the [[Sword Coast]], sold by Sister [[Tasina]] of the [[Temple of Umberlee (Spindrift Town)|Temple of Umberlee]] in [[Spindrift Town]].
