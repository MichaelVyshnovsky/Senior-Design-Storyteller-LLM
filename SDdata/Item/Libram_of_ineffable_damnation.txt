A '''''Libram of Ineffable Damnation''''' was a [[book|tome]] of great value to [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spellcasters who venerated evil.

==Powers==
To make use of the work, an evil [[wizard]] needed to spend a week cloistered and undisturbed, perusing the tome. Before {{yearlink|1372}}, the book would teach them approximately half of what they needed to take their skills to the next level; after {{yearlink|1372}}, these books instead increased the natural qualities of the magician that governed their spellcasting. In either case, the book disappeared after use, and no mage could gain the benefit of such a tome again.

Arcane casters whose alignment was rejected by the book suffered severe damage, were left unconscious for 50-200 minutes, commensurate to the damage taken, and needed an ''[[atonement]]'' spell cast in order to continue their studies before {{yearlink|1372}}. Anyone not an arcane spellcaster in the first place who read the tome was at risk of ''[[insanity]]''.

==Notable Users==
* [[Munafik]], high priest of [[Amun-Re]], and Master of Tomes of [[Terbakar]], was interred with a ''libram of ineffable damnation''.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|60}}
* [[Tiamat]] had one of these librams among the treasure horde in [[Tiamat's Lair|her lair]] in the [[Abyss]].
