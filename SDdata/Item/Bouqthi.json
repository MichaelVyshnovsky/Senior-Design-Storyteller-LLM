        "mainbody": "ouqthi was a type of pastry made in Luiren.\nThis delicious pastry was made by stuffing sugared dough with red rhubarb stalks harvested from the southern edge of the Long Forest. There were easily a hundred different variations of the basic recipe, with all being a delicious treat in their own right.\nDespite its popularity, bouqthi was rarely exported since pastries did not fare well under the rigors of travelling over long distances."
