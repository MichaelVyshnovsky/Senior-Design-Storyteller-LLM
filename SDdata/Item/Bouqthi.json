        "Description": "This delicious pastry was made by stuffing sugared dough with red [[rhubarb]] stalks harvested from the southern edge of the [[Long Forest]]. There were easily a hundred different variations of the basic recipe, with all being a delicious treat in their own right.\n\nDespite its popularity, ''bouqthi'' was rarely exported since pastries did not fare well under the rigors of travelling over long distances."
