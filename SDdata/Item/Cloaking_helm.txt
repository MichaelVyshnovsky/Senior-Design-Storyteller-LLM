}}A '''''cloaking helm''''' was a type of [[spelljamming helm]] that allowed the navigating [[mage]] to create an [[illusion]] of empty space around the [[spelljammer|ship]] to effectively cloak it from detection.{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}

==Powers==
While the ''cloaking helms'' created the appearance of invisibility from afar, the pilot and crew were still able to see the ship while it was in use. The only way to detect a cloaked spelljamming ship was through the use of ''[[ESP]]'', detection, or [[scrying]] [[spell]]s, or the refraction of bright light upon the ship's surface, which was visible within a range of about 1000 yards (0.9 km). This appeared as a blurred, rainbow-like effect around the ship's silhouette.

The cloaking field could be maintained for 3 hours every day, only when the ship was traveling at slower speeds. Any contact with another vessel, or firing of its weaponry would undo the illusion.

==History==
These helms were designed and crafted by a group of [[Arcane (race)|Arcane]] and [[wizard]]s working together, for the [[Seekers]] in their information-gathering endeavors. Soon after word spread of their development, many of these researchers were assassinated and the helms sought with fervor. Few remained spread across [[wildspace]], and as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] the few known ''cloaking helms'' not in use were in the possession of the Arcane.
