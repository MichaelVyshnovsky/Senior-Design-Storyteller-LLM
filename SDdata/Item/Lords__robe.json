        "mainbody": "A Lords robe was an enchanted piece of clothing given to all Lords of Waterdeep. It was one of three articles, referred to collecitvely as the Lords ensemble.\nThese robes were dark black and voluminous.\nThe magic of a Lords robe disguised the shape and height of the Lord who wore it, making all Lords appear to be approximately  tall with an unknown gender. A true seeing spell could pierce the illusion, but even in that case the physical nature of the robe made it difficult to distinguish physical features."
