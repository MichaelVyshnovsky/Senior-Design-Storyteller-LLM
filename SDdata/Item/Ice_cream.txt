'''Ice cream''' was an uncommon variety of frozen dairy dish served as a last kiss of a meal or a smallbite dessert.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Good, the Undead, and the Ugly|11,21}}
{{quote|Tis a root beer float, but despite the name it has nothing to do with beer. Use the straw to stir and melt the cold stuff â€“ ice cream, they call it, and sip slowly. Let the tastes combine.|[[Elminster Aumar]] on [[Earth]].}}

==Description==
Typically made with [[egg]]s, [[sugar]], and [[cream]], making ice cream was a long process. Egg whites were whipped with sugar until they achieved a stiff-peak consistency, then the same was done with cream, and the two mixtures were carefully folded into each other and left to freeze.

Some cooks who were blessed with [[the Gift]] could use such [[spell]]s as ''[[ray of frost]]'' to chill and freeze the ice cream mixture into the cold dessert form. Others could use [[ice chest|ice-boxes]] or freezing temperatures and snow outside.
