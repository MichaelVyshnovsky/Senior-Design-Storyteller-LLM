A '''bow and arrow set''' was a type of toy designed for children to play pretend and emulate [[ranger]]s, as well as means by which to teach children proper etiquette regarding ranged weaponry. Despite being supposedly harmless fun, it was generally advised that adults supervise children playing with them.

==Description==
Each set consisted of three [[bowstring]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|23}} by affixed [[bean bag]]s, and a small [[bow]]. These bows were crafted with a very resilient [[willow]] stem, had a {{SI|5|lb}} pull, and weighed around {{SIrange|2|3|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold bow and arrow sets made in [[the Dalelands]] for 2 [[gold piece]]s.
* The [[Toysmiths]], a toyshop in Ravens Bluff that was owned and operated by the [[gnome]] brothers [[Gunder Gaewilder|Gunder]] and [[Relvan Gaewilder]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|7}} sold bow and arrow sets at the same price.
