The Cutlass of the Golden Gulf was a magical weapon that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. It was favored by corsairs and other sailors.
This weapon provided the wielder with small enhancements to their fighting skill, but its main power was that it allowed the wielder to breath underwater so long as the weapon was in their hand.
