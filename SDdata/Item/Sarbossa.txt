'''Sarbossa''', also known as '''[[wikipedia:en:thomsonite|thomsonite]]''', '''lintonite''', '''comptonite''', '''ozakite''', '''eye stone''', or '''fire rock''', occurred in small nodules up to 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter left behind in cavities formed by volcanic activity.

==Description==
This [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] was fibrous and therefore both tough and soft. It was usually grayish green in color but was sometimes beautifully colored with rings of pink, red, white, and green.

==Powers==
Adding sarbossa to the material component of spells that morphed the shape of a target object or creature added one to two minutes to the duration of the spell.
