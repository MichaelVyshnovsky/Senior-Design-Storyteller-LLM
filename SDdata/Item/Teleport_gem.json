        "mainbody": "A teleport gem was a device that teleported the user.\nTeleport gems teleported the user to a predetermined location.\nOne such teleport gem was owned by Florin Falconhand in the mid-14 century DR it was keyed to Evermeet, where the elven mother of his child lived.\nAnother such gem was owned by Queen Filfaeryl Obarskyr of Cormyr, who refused to use it to transport herself to safety during the ambush in Thundaerlyn Hall, in , at the hands of the Rightful Conspiracy. The gem was instead shattered by one of the conspirators while trying to skewer her with a blade.\nThe mage Carmanstos of Ravens Bluff created teleport gems of his own by imbuing enchantments in gemstones, which released spells when shattered. Another mage in Ravens Bluff, Aleesia, may have furnished a different kind of teleport gem to adventurers, possibly a silver orb which she may have named as a gem by mistake.The teleport gem is not referred to in the text again, and other references are instead to a silver orb that she provides instead, which is missing from the reference to the teleport gem.\n* Florin Falconhand\n* Filfaeril Obarskyr\n* Carmanstos\n* Aleesia"
