The gem was instead shattered by one of the conspirators while trying to skewer her with a blade.\n\nThe mage [[Carmanstos]] of [[Raven's Bluff]] created ''teleport gems'' of his own by imbuing enchantments in gemstones, which released spells when shattered.{{cite organized play/LC/Unfinished Business|7}} Another mage in Raven's Bluff, [[Aleesia]], may have furnished a different kind of ''teleport gem'' to adventurers, possibly a [[silver]] orb which she may have named as a gem by mistake.{{Cite organized play/LC/Stormbreaker}}The teleport gem is not referred to in the text again, and other references are instead to a silver orb that she provides instead, which is missing from the reference to the teleport gem.",
