        "mainbody": "The '''Fifth Imaskarcana''' was an [[artifact]] and one of the [[Imaskarcana|''Seven Imaskarcana'']], artifacts created to hold the lore of the [[Imaskari Empire]]. It was said to be one of the most powerful creations of the [[Imaskari artificer]]s.",
        "Description": "The ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' was a scepter, pitted and battered in appearance, about 2 feet (0.6 meters) in length and set with a fist-sized [[amethyst]].",
        "Powers": "The ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' contained the entire military history of the Imaskar from [[-7500 DR|−7500 DR]] onward, and telepathically answered any questions that the wielder had on the subject. It also provided the wielder with powerful spell resistance. If commanded, the scepter would use a number of powerful mind-affecting spells.\n\nAll commands to the Imaskarcana had to be spoken in [[Roushoum]], the language of the Imaskari empire. If addressed in a different language, the ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' would immediately cast a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell on its wielder.",
        "History": "While some sources claimed the ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' was created 8500 years before the 14{{th}} century DR, other sources put its creation on the year {{Yearlink|-3891}}, under the orders of Lord [[Omanond]].<ref>\n\nThe ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' was wielded by Lord [[Dimarond]], General of Imaskar, as he fell outside [[Inupras]] in {{Yearlink|-2488}}, before an enraged throng led by [[glorious servitor]]s.",
        "Notable Owners": "*Lord [[Dimarond]]"
