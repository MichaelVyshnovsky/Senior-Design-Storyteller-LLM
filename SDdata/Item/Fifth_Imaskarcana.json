        "mainbody": "The Fifth Imaskarcana was an artifact and one of the Seven Imaskarcana, artifacts created to hold the lore of the Imaskari Empire. It was said to be one of the most powerful creations of the Imaskari artificers. \nThe Fifth Imaskarcana was a scepter, pitted and battered in appearance, about 2 feet (0.6 meters) in length and set with a fist-sized amethyst.\nThe Fifth Imaskarcana contained the entire military history of the Imaskar from −7500 DR onward, and telepathically answered any questions that the wielder had on the subject. It also provided the wielder with powerful spell resistance. If commanded, the scepter would use a number of powerful mind-affecting spells.\nAll commands to the Imaskarcana had to be spoken in Roushoum, the language of the Imaskari empire. If addressed in a different language, the Fifth Imaskarcana would immediately cast a disintegrate spell on its wielder.\nWhile some sources claimed the Fifth Imaskarcana was created 8500 years before the 14 century DR, other sources put its creation on the year , under the orders of Lord Omanond.\nThe Fifth Imaskarcana was wielded by Lord Dimarond, General of Imaskar, as he fell outside Inupras in , before an enraged throng led by glorious servitors.\n*Lord Dimarond"
