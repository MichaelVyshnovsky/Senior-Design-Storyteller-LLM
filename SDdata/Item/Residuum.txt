Following the Spellplague, a large number of shadovar sought to reconstruct the mythallar of Xinlenal. To achieve this they sought out magic items to disenchant for their residuum, then fed that substance through white-hot tubes of melted glass before dripping it on to the mythallar.
Residuum could be used as a generic material component substitute for any ritual.
