'''Residuum''' was a magical substance that was left behind whenever a [[magic item]] was disenchanted. Some described it as concentrated [[magic]]. It could often be found inside the bodies of creatures that fed upon magical items, such as [[rust monster]]s and [[steel predator]]s.

==Description==
This substance was a silvery powder.

==Varieties==
;Abyssal Residuum: magical residue left behind by abyssal magic.
;Concentrated Residuum: a form of residuum that had been magically reduced to allow for a higher concentration. Some could be found in the [[Whispering Caverns]].
;Dark Residuum: the purified remnants of [[necromancer|necromantic]] magic.
;Fartouched Residuum: a residue left behind by powerful [[Far Realm]] energies.
;Ostorian Residuum: concentrated magic left from the days of the Kingdom of [[Ostoria]].

==History==
Following the [[Spellplague]], a large number of [[shadovar]] sought to reconstruct the [[mythallar]] of [[Xinlenal]]. To achieve this they sought out magic items to disenchant for their residuum, then fed that substance through white-hot tubes of melted glass before dripping it on to the mythallar.

==Usages==
Residuum could be used as a generic [[material component]] substitute for any [[ritual]].
