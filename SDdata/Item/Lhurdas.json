        "mainbody": "hurdas, also known as \"the yellow death\" and \"Beltyns Last Drink\", was an ingested poison that was usually mixed with wine.\nLhurdas itself tasted like a sharp and dry, white-grape wine. As a poison, that was why it was most often mixed with white wine.\nLhurdas was effective against those of elf, human, or orc heritage. Ingesting it caused nausea, convulsions, and severe cramping and burning pain as it reacted with the stomachs digestive acids and literally ate away at the internal organs. It took effect in two minutes, and lasted another three. If one survived the initial damage, then they seemed to be immune to its damaging effects for three to twenty-four days thereafter, being discomforted and unable to heal, but not harmed any further. It had no effect on the skin.\nLhurdas was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage Lethchauntos the Black, during his time spent with an orc tribe. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists."
