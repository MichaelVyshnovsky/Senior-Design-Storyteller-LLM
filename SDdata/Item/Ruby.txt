Ruby was a variety of corundum that was a popular and plentiful jewel and had many magical uses in addition to its appeal as a sparkling gemstone. It was cherished by worshipers of many gods, including Callarduran Smoothhands, Erevan Ilesere, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, and Labelas Enoreth.
Rubies came in a variety of colors, from colorless through shades of red to deep crimson. The darker the shade and the fewer the inclusions and impurities, the more valuable was the gem. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp. About one in every hundred rubies was a star ruby.
Rubies were believed to represent love and revenge.
