'''Javelins''' were a type of simple, thrown, ranged weapon, similar to a [[shortspear]].

==Description==
Javelins were light, flexible spears designed primarily as a throwing weapon, They were usually constructed of wood and tapered to a sharp point at one or both ends. Alternatively, they could be tipped with a small metal spearhead. The shaft was much thinner than a spear intended for melee combat.

==Weaponology==
The javelin was a ranged weapon, intended to be thrown. Javelins were not sturdy enough for most melee combat and if wielded in this way they would perform poorly. The normal maximum range of a javelin was {{SI|150|ft|long=yes}}.

Javelins could easily be used on both foot or mountedback.
