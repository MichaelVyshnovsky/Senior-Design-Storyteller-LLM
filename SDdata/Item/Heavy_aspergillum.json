        "mainbody": "A '''heavy aspergillum''' was a weapon that combined the features of an [[aspergillum]] and a [[heavy mace]]. It was only used by the [[church of Ilmater|Ilmaterans]] of the kingdom of [[Impiltur]].",
        "Description": "Like the ordinary aspergillum, the heavy aspergillum took the form of a metal club or mace, with a reservoir inside that could contain up to three flask's worth of [[holy water]]. Pressing a button on the shaft opened up the perforations in the head, allowing holy water to leak out. In this way, the aspergillum could spray holy water over a short distance or on anything struck by it, using one flask's worth per shot.\n\nUnlike the ordinary aspergillum, the heavy aspergillum was designed as a melee weapon, with the effectiveness of a heavy mace.",
        "Uses": "In addition to its ritual uses, the heavy aspergillum could be used as a weapon as well as a means of spraying monsters with holy water. ''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], it was used almost exclusively by the worshipers of [[Ilmater]] the Crying God in the kingdom of Impiltur against the [[demon]]s that terrorized that realm."
