Utensils of the cultured palate were magical sets of eating utensils that gave their users the exact taste they desired.
Sets of utensils of the cultured palate consisted of cups, knives, forks, and spoons. They could be made of nearly any material, and they were usually ornate and of high quality make. The utensils were typically kept in a special case or pouch.
Utensils of the cultured palate gave food or drink any taste the user desired, regardless of actual type, quality, or age. The consumed items were as nutritious and satisfactory as the imagined meal would have been. The utensils could not be used to alter the effective quantity of food, however.
Utensils of the cultured palate were among the items recommended for aspiring cooks to procure in the Codex of Eldritch Cuisine.
