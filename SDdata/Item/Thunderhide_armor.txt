==Description==
Thunderhide armor was made from layers of treated hides of [[dinosaur]]s (called "thunderers"), or other large reptiles. It was more supple than regular [[hide armor]].

==Usage==
Thunderhide armor was most commonly worn by [[druid]]s in [[Chult]] and in the [[Lizard Marsh]] and [[Serpent Hills]].
