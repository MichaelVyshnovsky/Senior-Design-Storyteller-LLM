Thunderhide armor was a type of armor used on Toril.
Thunderhide armor was made from layers of treated hides of dinosaurs (called "thunderers"), or other large reptiles. It was more supple than regular hide armor.
Thunderhide armor was most commonly worn by druids in Chult and in the Lizard Marsh and Serpent Hills.
