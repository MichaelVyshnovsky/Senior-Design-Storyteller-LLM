He ordered a butt of Westgate Ruby from Shortshanks of the Bold Bard tavern, swearing it was the only wine to have with Beef and Oysters Barnabas.\nAt the dinner on Eleint 19, it was the most popular dish on offer, with the councilmen queuing up and coming back for more, though this was mostly due to the beautiful Mayella Meadowbrock doing the serving. Even Jasper had seconds, despite hating oysters."
