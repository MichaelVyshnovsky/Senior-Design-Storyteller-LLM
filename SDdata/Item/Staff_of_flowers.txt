A '''''staff of flowers''''' was a [[enchanted|magical]] [[staff]] that caused flowers to grow.

==Powers==
When pointed at earth or soil, it caused a regular, non-magical flower to sprout. The wielder was able to choose which flower would grow, but if they didn't, the staff, by default, created a [[daisy]]. The staff held ten charges, and each time the staff was used to create a flower, a charge was expended. The staff recharged itself daily at dawn. When the last charge was used, there was a chance the staff would turn into a bunch of flower petals.

A ''staff of flowers'' was a part of a set that, when used together, boosted the magics of all items in the set: the staff, the ''[[Woven Vine]]'', and the ''[[Blooming Cord]]''.

==Notable Owners==
The eccentric [[druid]] [[Wyllow]] had a ''staff of flowers'', which she kept on the second floor of her tower, [[Wyllow's Tower]], located in [[Wyllowwood]], the fifth level of [[Undermountain]].
