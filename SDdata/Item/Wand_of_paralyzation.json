        "mainbody": "A '''''wand of paralyzation''''', also known as a '''''wand of paralysis''''', was a magical [[wand]] capable of paralyzing opponents.",
        "Description": "When activated, a ''wand of paralyzation'' shot a beam of blue light at its target.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Wand of paralyzation TC.png|thumb|''A demonstration of the [[wand]]'s function.'']]\nThe user could expend a charge of the [[wand]] to ''[[paralyze]]'' opponents, before potentially crumbling to ash. The wand itself had seven charges, and when used, it would emit a blue ray out of its tip, towards a creature within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. The creature that was struck would be paralyzed for a minute.\n\nAt dawn, two to seven charges (the maximum amount) would be replenished.",
        "Notable Wands of Paralyzation": "*''[[Ebony Rod Runewand]]s'': wands made out of [[yew]] tree and magically transformed into [[dagger]]s and [[lance]]s. These enchanted weapons still had the wands' ''paralyzation'' abilities, as well as ''[[poison]]ed'' edge. These weapons were wielded by ''[[rune magic]]'' adepts in the [[Bloodstone Lands]].",

        "Reputation": "Not many names of wizards who created these wands were widely known due to the stigma that ''wands of paralyzation'' carriedâ€”many associated these wands with cruelty and treacherousness. Even though ''wands of paralyzation'' were often used by brave adventurers, the tavern tales about heroic warriors being captured and tortured with these wands were simply more popular."
