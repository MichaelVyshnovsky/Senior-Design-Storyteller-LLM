        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of spell storing''''' was a [[magic]] [[ring]] that stored a number of [[spell]]s.",
        "Powers": "As the name suggested, a ''ring of spell storing'' stored spells for later use. To store a spell, the spellcaster simply cast the spell as normal, but targeted to the ring, and the spell remained intact within it. The spell could then be released and fully cast by anyone who wore the ring. This allowed a spellcaster to prepare a spell for a non-spellcaster, or cast a spell from a [[scroll]] into the ring for later use. Multiple spellcasters, and both [[arcane]] and [[divine]] casters, could have spells in a single ''ring of spell storing''.\n\nDifferent spells were stored according to the type of ring. A ''minor ring of spell storing'' stored only a few spells, such as either three simple spells, or one minor spell and two simple spells. A standard ''ring of spell storing'' stored more spells and those of intermediate power, and a ''major ring of spell storing'' stored far more spells and those only a master [[mage]] could typically cast.",
        "Creation": "Along with the skill to craft magic rings, a creator required the ''[[imbue with spell ability]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In the [[1358 DR|Year of the Prince, 1358 DR]], [[Khelben Arunsun]] lent a ''ring of spell storing'' to [[Kyriani]] and [[Onyx the Invincible]] to use against the villains [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] marauding around [[Waterdeep]]. Kyriani placed a ''[[fireball]]'' in the ring, and Onyx used it to surprise Aviss and Fellandar, who had not expected the [[dwarf]] to use magic against them.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|17, 19}}"
