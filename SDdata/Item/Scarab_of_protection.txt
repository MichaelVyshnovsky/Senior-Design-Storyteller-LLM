'''''Scarabs of protection''''' were enchanted carved [[amulet]]s that enveloped the wearer in a protective invisible barrier.

==Description==
''Scarabs of protection'' were usually carved out of stone to resemble a desert [[insect]], a round bodied [[scarab]]. The main telltale sign of its magical protective properties was evident when a ''scarab'' was held for over six seconds, when the item manifested an arcane inscription on its surface.

When exposed to a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell effect, ''scarabs of protection'' radiated strong ''[[abjuration]]'' and ''[[necromancy]]'' energy.

==Powers==
The magic imbued within these ''scarabs'' carried greatly and usually depended on the carver's skills. The invisible magical protective field that surrounded the wearer increased their defenses against magical and mundane negative effects.

A more powerful version of ''scarabs of protection'' gave the wearer powerful spell resistance and allowed them to negate magical attacks up to twelve times. Such attacks could be energy-draining, instant death effects, and adverse energy effects. After a ''scarab absorbed twelve such spells'', it shattered and destroyed.

==Creation==
''Scarabs of protection'' could be created by a skilled crafter of wondrous items and the use of ''[[death ward (spell)|death ward]]'' and ''[[spell resistance]]'' spells.

==History==
The sages determined the origins of these bug-shaped magical items to lay somewhere far south from the [[Sword Coast]], but the exact location and time of creation remained undetermined. By late 14{{th}} century, these ''scarabs'' could  be found in many places along the Sword Coast, and cities such as [[Neverwinter]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Alasklerbanbastos]], the great [[undead]] wyrm of [[Dragonback Mountain]] had a ''scarab'' in his hoard.
*[[Dracandros]] of the Crimson, a villainous [[Red Wizard]] carried a ''scarab of protection'' during his time with the ''New Alliance''.
*[[Eltoora Sarptyl]] of [[Port Last]] owned a ''scarab'' of the ''+2'' enchantments ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].
*[[Jarlaxle]], a [[drow]] mercenary leader owned a plethora of defensive magical items, including one of the ''scarabs of protection''.
*[[Husher Clay]] in [[Beorunna's Well]] ''circa'' 1372 DR.
*[[Ophala Cheldarstorn]] of Neverwinter was in possession of one of these amulets in 1372 DR.
*[[Rhessajan Ambermantle]] the ruler of [[Scornubel]] ''circa'' [[1367 DR]] carried one of the ''scarabs''.
*[[Tchazzar]], the Chosen of [[Tiamat]] [[red dragon]] had a ''scarab of protection'' as a part of his treasure hoard.
*[[Valdemar]], a [[green dragon]] who resided in [[Undermountain]] could never be encountered without his trusty ''scarab''.
