        "mainbody": "A '''''chalice of continual water''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[chalice]] that could produce an endless stream of water.",
        "Powers": "When bent to their lip, these chalices produced a stream of pure, cool water. A chalice would continue to produce a stream of water so long as it was not standing on its base.",
        "Notable Chalices of Continual Water": "* In the center of the [[Tears of Selune]], an overturned ''chalice of continual water'' was the source of a constant stream of water that poured out from an open doorway of the unnamed castle on the asteroid known as [[the Castle]], which spilled out into [[wildspace]] and followed the asteroid's [[gravity plane]].",
        "History": "Sometime in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[Ravenian]] [[adventurer]]s found themselves transported from [[Toril]] to the planet [[Anadia]]. The adventurers saved a group of pacifist, philosopher [[Anadian halfling]]s from a group of murderous [[plainsjan]]s and [[umberhulk]]s. Grateful for the rescue, the Anadians provided the adventurers a way back to Toril and gifted them a ''chalice of continual water'' that had been produced on Anadia. The chalice was made of fine [[silver]] and etched with a relief depicting their craggy mountain home, beneath [[the sun]] and a [[galleon]] [[spelljammer]] at its center.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Something Weird is Going On in Late Uncle Rupert's Root Cellar|14-16}}"
