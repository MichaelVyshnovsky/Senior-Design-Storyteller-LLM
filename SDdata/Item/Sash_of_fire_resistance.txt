Sashes of fire resistance were magical items that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These items often appeared as red silk sashes with extravagant platinum thread brocade. These sashes could not be worn over armor heavier than leather.
The wearer of this sash was completely immune to normal fire as well as fire-based warding spells such as wall of fire or fire trap. Additionally, the wearer ignored half of the damaging effects from offensive spells such as fireball.
These items were specially crafted by members of the Brotherhood of the True Flame. Ranking members of the Brotherhood were awarded them as gifts.
