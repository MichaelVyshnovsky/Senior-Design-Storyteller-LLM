'''''Sashes of fire resistance''''' were [[magical item]]s that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the [[Land of Fate]].

==Description==
These items often appeared as red [[silk]] [[sash]]es with extravagant platinum thread brocade. These sashes could not be worn over armor heavier than [[leather armor|leather]].

==Powers==
The wearer of this sash was completely immune to normal fire as well as fire-based warding spells such as ''[[wall of fire]]'' or ''[[fire trap]]''. Additionally, the wearer ignored half of the damaging effects from offensive spells such as ''[[fireball]]''.

==Notable Owners==
These items were specially crafted by members of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]]. Ranking members of the Brotherhood were awarded them as gifts.
===Individuals===
* [[Najeeya bint Siddiq]]
