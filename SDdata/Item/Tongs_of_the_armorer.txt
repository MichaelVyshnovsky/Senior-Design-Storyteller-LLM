The '''''tongs of the armorer''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] [[tongs]], used by the best craftsmen of the ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The ''tongs of the armorer'' appeared masterfully crafted and radiated dim shine.

==Powers==
These magic tongs were enchanted to dramatically enhance the wielder crafting and armorsmithing skills when working with metal.

==History==
The ''tongs of the armorer'', along with the ''[[hammer of the weaponsmith]]'', were placed on display within the Artisan's Hall within the [[Crypt of Rothilion]]. The magic tools could be found in the Smith's Alcove to the left from the entrance to the tomb. The Crypt of Rothilion was sealed before the advent of hte [[Weeping War]] and the fall of Myth Drannor. The tomb remained undisturbed until it was unsealed in [[1369 DR]] buring the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s attempts to take over the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' within the ruined City of Song.
