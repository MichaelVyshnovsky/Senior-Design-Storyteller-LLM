* The ritual of warding artifacts by magical aptitude, a ritual taught at the College of Shaping Magics, required a rubellite worth at least 500 silver pieces.
In the late 15 century DR, untapped veins of rubellite could be found around the wild tundra of Cold Run. During that time it was commonly being used in the manufacture of titansteel equipment, magical rings, and sparkling, multicolored panes of glass.
