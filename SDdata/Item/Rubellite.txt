'''Rubellite''' was a variety of [[tourmaline]] that was pink, red,<ref>{{Cite dragon/248/Crystal Confusion|48}} or reddish-purple in coloration.

==Usage==
[[File:Raw Rubellite.png|thumb|''Raw rubellite'']]
* The ''[[ritual of warding artifacts by magical aptitude]]'', a [[ritual]] taught at the [[College of Shaping Magics]], required a rubellite worth at least 500 [[silver piece]]s.<ref>

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], untapped veins of rubellite could be found around the wild tundra of [[Cold Run]]. During that time it was commonly being used in the manufacture of [[titansteel]] equipment, magical [[ring]]s, and sparkling, multicolored panes of glass.
