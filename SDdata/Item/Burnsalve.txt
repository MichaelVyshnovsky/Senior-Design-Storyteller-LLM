Burnsalve was an alchemical ointment used to treat burns.
Applied to a burn, it minimized the impairments that the wound caused. Stronger versions also allowed burns to heal faster.
The substance could be made with herbal skills, but the stronger versions were difficult to synthesize, requiring a combination of solid alchemical and herbal skills, or exemplary skills in both areas for the strongest version. Hedge wizards often traded in it.
