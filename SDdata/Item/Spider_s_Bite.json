        "mainbody": "The Spiders Bite was an crude but enchanted longbow crafted out of a body parts of a giant spider.\nThe Spiders Bite was created using fangs of a very large spider with a fine strand of spiderweb strung between the fangs as a bowstring.\nThis enchanted bow was infused with magical venom that was projected with the arrows fired towards the bows target. When hit, it ate away at the target with potent poison damage.\nThis longbow was found by the Champion of the Burning Dawn circa 1490 DR, inside a cave lair of a particularly nasty white-colored giant spider that killed and cocooned one of the caravans beloved horse named Sarah."
