Equipment frames were tools sometimes used by rangers or woodsmen throughout Faer√ªn.
Equipment frames were made from steel and weighed . Hooks were strategically placed about the frame for hanging gear.
These items were used to effectively store and carry gear, evenly distributing their collective weight on the wearers hips instead of shoulders, allowing them to conserve energy.
Equipment frames were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 10 gold pieces, and a weatherproof canvas fly could be had for an additional 3 silver pieces.
