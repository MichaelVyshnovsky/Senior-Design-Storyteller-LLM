        "mainbody": "An '''''elixir of youth''''' was a potent and rare elixir that reversed aging.",
        "Description": "These elixirs were somewhat similar to ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]'', in that they reduced the age of the imbiber. However, these rare elixirs had no chance of negative effects occurring. Consuming the potions made the drinkers younger by 2 to 5 years, but they must consume it in one go, otherwise the aging effect would not be as potent.",
        "Availability": "''Elixirs of youth'' were found in a variety of regions, particularly around the [[Moonsea]].",
        "Creation": "One of the known ingredients for these elixirs was [[ginseng]] juice.",
        "History": "A magical spring that produced ''elixir of youth'' was once found near [[Durapatya]] in the [[Kuong Kingdom]], [[Malatra]]. Though its magic had faded by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[pilgrim]]s and others seeking cures still flocked there."
