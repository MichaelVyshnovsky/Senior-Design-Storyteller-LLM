        "mainbody": "n elixir of youth was a potent and rare elixir that reversed aging.\nThese elixirs were somewhat similar to potions of longevity, in that they reduced the age of the imbiber. However, these rare elixirs had no chance of negative effects occurring. Consuming the potions made the drinkers younger by 2 to 5 years, but they must consume it in one go, otherwise the aging effect would not be as potent.\nElixirs of youth were found in a variety of regions, particularly around the Moonsea.\nOne of the known ingredients for these elixirs was ginseng juice.\nA magical spring that produced elixir of youth was once found near Durapatya in the Kuong Kingdom, Malatra. Though its magic had faded by the midâ€“14 century DR, pilgrims and others seeking cures still flocked there."
