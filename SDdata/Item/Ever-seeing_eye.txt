The ever-seeing eye was a magical amulet crafted by the hag Auntie Ethel.
The amulet took the form of a single humanoid eye suspended by winding branches that were taken from the limbs of a dead tree. The eye was taken from a foolhardy woman that once imposed herself upon Ethel by begging her a single favor.
The wielder of the ever-seeing eye could gain temporary protection against both morally just and especially malevolent beings alike, for a short amount of time.
* Auntie Ethel, the hag that crafted the necklace from one of her often-encountered solicitors.
