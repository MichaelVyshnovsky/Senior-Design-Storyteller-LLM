        "mainbody": "'''Stone biters''' were a type of [[arrow]] with heads specially designed for the purpose of attaching [[rope]]s to battlements, walls, or other structures. They required careful craftsmanship to produce.",
        "Description": "Stone biters had narrow, heavy heads made of high-quality metal, with small ridges in place of the barbs one would find a [[wood biter arrow]]. They were usually sharpened to the greatest extent possible. Standard stone biters could provide a grip for relatively soft stone structures, such as those made of brick or [[sandstone]], but those that used [[adamantine]] in their manufacture were capable of biting into all but the hardest of stone surfaces.",
        "Availability": "* Some metalsmiths in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] were known to produce stone biter arrows, including ones made with adamantine.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/113/The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter}}"
