        "mainbody": "Stone biters were a type of arrow with heads specially designed for the purpose of attaching ropes to battlements, walls, or other structures. They required careful craftsmanship to produce.\nStone biters had narrow, heavy heads made of high-quality metal, with small ridges in place of the barbs one would find a wood biter arrow. They were usually sharpened to the greatest extent possible. Standard stone biters could provide a grip for relatively soft stone structures, such as those made of brick or sandstone, but those that used adamantine in their manufacture were capable of biting into all but the hardest of stone surfaces.\n* Some metalsmiths in the city of Ravens Bluff were known to produce stone biter arrows, including ones made with adamantine."
