Arcane mail was the enchanted set of plate mail that once belonged to one of the original Knights of Myth Drannor, Jelde Asturien.
Arcane mail was a set of heavy armor covered in magical sigils and runes.
This unique plate armor had a +2 enchantment and dramatically improved the wearers defense. The most notable thing about the arcane mail was that this items magic allowed a wizard to wear it with no adverse impact on their spellcasting ability, apart from the armors weight.
At some point before 1369 DR, while exploring the ruins of Myth Drannor, Jelde Asturien found his way into the ancient tomb under the mansion of House Ammath in the Glim-Gardens district and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. In  1369 DR, the vault still contained Jeldes blade of destruction and a set of arcane mail, with a message written by him that offered these enchanted items as aid to future explorers as their original owners no longer needed them. However, a dark naga nested in the adjacent room to the hidden vault making it dangerous to access.
