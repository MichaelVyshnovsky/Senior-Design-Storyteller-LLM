'''Blackbark soup''' was a type of common [[elf|elvish]] soup in [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Like most elven soups, blackbark was usually served cold. It was prepared using a mix of bark from four or five different species of trees and bushes. When cooked, blackbark soup tasted somewhat similar to beef stew and was quite thick.
