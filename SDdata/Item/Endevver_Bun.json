He first published his recipe for the sweet rolls in the . The cooks daughter once said that the buns taste was \"like my tongue is enjoying a revel.\" Endevver found it so amusing he named the treat Endevvers Reveltongue.\nThe popularity of the recipe persisted well into the late 15 century DR, when a nephew, or similarly related family member of a coin-hungry pawnbroker, Raylin Pendro, showed up in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the 1490s DR. He took over Raylins pawnshop and turned it into a bakery that made some of the best cinnamon rolls on all the Sword Coast, according to Kira Darvis."
