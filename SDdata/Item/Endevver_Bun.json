        "History": "These cinnamon buns were invented by a [[Cormyr]]ean cook and [[chapbook]] writer named [[Endevver]]. He first published his recipe for the sweet rolls in the {{YearlinkName|292}}. The cook's daughter once said that the buns' taste was \"like my tongue is enjoying a revel.\" Endevver found it so amusing he named the treat Endevver's Reveltongue.\n\nThe popularity of the recipe persisted well into the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], when a nephew, or similarly related family member of a coin-hungry pawnbroker, [[Raylin Pendro]], showed up in the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the 1490s DR.{{HAT-time}} He took over Raylin's pawnshop and turned it into a bakery that made some of the best cinnamon rolls on all the [[Sword Coast]], according to [[Kira Darvis]]."
