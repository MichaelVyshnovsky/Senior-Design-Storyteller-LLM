Harvester of Blood was Sunbright Steelshankss longsword circa .
The sword had a blade the length of a human arm and ended with a sharp hook. Sunbright carried his weapon in a shoulder sheath on his back. Unlike most Rengarth weapons, the sword was forged from steel instead of bronze or iron.
During the Shadowed Age, the sword belonged to the Raven Tribe shaman Sevenhaunt, but after his death the blade was passed down to his son, Sunbright Steelshanks, by his mother, Monkberry.
