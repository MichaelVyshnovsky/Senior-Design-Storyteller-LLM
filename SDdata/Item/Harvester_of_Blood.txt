'''Harvester of Blood''' was [[Sunbright Steelshanks]]<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[longsword]] ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-700}}.

==Description==
The [[sword]] had a blade the length of a [[human]] arm and ended with a sharp hook. Sunbright carried his weapon in a shoulder sheath on his back. Unlike most [[Rengarth]] weapons, the sword was forged from [[steel]] instead of [[bronze]] or [[iron]].

==History==
During the [[Shadowed Age]], the sword belonged to the [[Raven Tribe]] [[shaman]] [[Sevenhaunt]], but after his death the blade was passed down to his son, Sunbright Steelshanks, by his mother, [[Monkberry]].
