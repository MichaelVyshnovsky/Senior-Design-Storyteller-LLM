        "mainbody": "'''The Music Box''' was a devious and exotic torture device.",
        "Description": "This mechanism, was  facetiously called for its functionality and form. The Music Box was a [[humanoid]]-sized cage with its bars created out of tuning forks. Once hit, the cage started reverberating with high-pitched tones, eventually driving the victim locked inside insane and causing profuse ear bleeding.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], one of these devices could be found in [[Daggerford]]'s curio shop, [[Stop Hole Abbey]]. However, at the time, the Music Box was not for sale as per the store owner, [[Vladmyr]]."
