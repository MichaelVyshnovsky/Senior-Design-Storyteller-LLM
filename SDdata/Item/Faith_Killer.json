        "mainbody": "The ''Faith Killer'' was an enchanted [[axe]] created by the power of sheer will and denial of divine powers.",
        "Description": "The ''Faith Killer'' appeared to be an ordinary one-handed axe.",
        "Powers": "The axe possessed a ''+2'' enchantment. It had a small chance of ''[[dispelling]]'' magic upon hit and granted the user a small amount of resistance to magic.\n\nIf a lawful-aligned creature not native to the [[Prime Material plane]] picked up the ''Faith Killer'', it almost certainly suffered lightning damage dealt to them by the enchanted weapon.",
        "History": "Sages postulated that the enchantments of the ''Faith Killer'' were born out of its original owner's, [[Erion]] the Skeptic, disbelief in gods and divine magic. Erion was one of very few on [[Toril]] who completely denied any and all deities and their devotees. He gained notoriety trying to exposed [[cleric]]s as charlatans and that divine magic was nothing more than arcane or some other type of magic unrelated to gods. Sages believed that Erion's conviction was so strong, it created sympathetic magical powers that were imbued onto the ''Faith Killer''. Erion the Skeptic's file was cut short by clergy of [[Sel√ªne]] who were forced to kill him in self-defense. The ''Faith Killer'' was taken by the priests, and as for Erion himself, it was believed his soul became the part of [[Myrkul]]'s [[Bone Castle]].\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], the ''Faith Killer'' found its way into the hands of [[Conlan]], the proprietor of [[Kuldahar]]'s blacksmith shop."
