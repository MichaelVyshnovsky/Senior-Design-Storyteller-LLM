'''''Flying''''' was a [[weapon quality|quality]] that could be applied to melee weapons. The weapon could be commanded to follow very simple orders, though it was not intelligent, and it could fly like an [[animated object]]. ''Flying'' weapons could also be used to guard a location, just like an animated [[skeleton]] could.

==Creation==
Forging a ''flying'' weapon required at least one of three spells: ''[[animate objects]]'', ''[[fly]]'', or ''[[telekinesis]]''.
