The '''Shadow Stone''' was a major [[artifact]] created by [[Madryoch]]. It was destroyed by [[Aeron Morieth]] in {{yearlink|1369}}.

==Description==
It was a large black monolith, held by a frame of [[iron]] inlaid with runes.

==Powers==
It weakened the magic around it, but it did not affect spells cast through the [[Shadow Weave]]. All those who touched the stone became enthralled, and had their magic modified to use the Shadow Weave.

Sometime after 1364, Madryoch adapted the Shadow Stone through a rite in order to increase its influence for hundreds of miles around, causing extensive damage to the ecology throughout [[Chessenta]].

==History==
Madryoch created it before being banished to the [[Demiplane of Imprisonment]].
