The Shadow Stone was a major artifact created by Madryoch. It was destroyed by Aeron Morieth in .
It was a large black monolith, held by a frame of iron inlaid with runes.
It weakened the magic around it, but it did not affect spells cast through the Shadow Weave. All those who touched the stone became enthralled, and had their magic modified to use the Shadow Weave.
Sometime after 1364, Madryoch adapted the Shadow Stone through a rite in order to increase its influence for hundreds of miles around, causing extensive damage to the ecology throughout Chessenta.
Madryoch created it before being banished to the Demiplane of Imprisonment.
