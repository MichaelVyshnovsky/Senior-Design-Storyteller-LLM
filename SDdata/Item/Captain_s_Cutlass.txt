'''''Captain's Cutlass''''' was a unique [[sword]] wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Valkur]], the Captain of the Waves.

==Description==
''Captain's Cutlass'' was usually a [[cutlass]], but could transform into a [[trident]] upon Valkur's command.

==Powers==
The weapon carried a powerful ''+3'' [[enchantment]] as both a cutlass and trident. At will, the wielder of the ''Cutlass'' could cast any [[spell]] from the [[weather sphere]] once per minute. In trident form the weapon was affixed to an unbreakable tether that extended to whatever range Valkur attempted to throw the weapon. Valkur could not be knocked over or toppled from a ship while holding the tether. He often used this to tow ships to shore.
