'''''Ice sapphires''''' were [[enchanted]] [[sapphire]]s found in the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]] that protected against cold.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|36}}

==Description==
These crystals had a deep blue coloration and inner light, though once their magical effect was used this inner light faded. They were notably always cool to the touch. Their value was significantly diminished after use.

==Powers==
''Ice sapphires'' granted their wielder the power to make a single, powerful casting of ''[[endure cold]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the world of [[Toril]] traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} While traveling in [[Asgard]], they stopped at the hall of [[Gloamingard]] at the same time as the [[Seelie Court]] was visiting. Queen [[Titania]], desiring some entertainment,<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|25-26}} challenged the adventurers to a series of friendly competitions against her [[fey]] entourage. Her consort, [[Enilbright]], suggested wagers be made to to make things more interesting. Agreeing with him, Titania offered to wager three [[magic item]]s if the adventurers would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items in turn. She offered as prizes an ''ice sapphire'', a ''[[Svartalfheim cloak]]'', and a ''[[horn of Valhalla]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|27}}
