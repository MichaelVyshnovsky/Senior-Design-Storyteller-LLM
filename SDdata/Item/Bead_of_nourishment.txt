Beads of nourishment were magical pellets that provided nourishment for extended periods of time.
The bead was spongy and gelatinous in texture. When eaten, it dissolved on the tongue but did not have any taste.
A single bead of nourishment provided an equivalent amount of nutrition to one days worth of rations.
