        "mainbody": "wand of misplaced objects was an enchanted wand capable of magically moving a targets carried objects, usually to a decidedly inconvienient location on their person.\nWhen activated these wands emitted golden orbs that swarmed around the target, temporarily confusing them to the point where they could not move. When the orbs vanished moments later they caused all of the targets carried items to shift to a different point on their person. The moved items could either be inconveniently relocated or not even seen at all. The impact of the sudden confusion of the item shifting caused the target to move about slowly until they rearranged their gear.\nThe power of a wand of misplaced objects had no effect upon items carried within a bag of holding or similar objects, however the bag of holding itself would be relocated.\nThese items could be recharged and each use consumed a single charge.\nAllet Tzuntzin, a half-elf tavern owner who lived in Waterdeep, carried a wand of misplaced objects."
