A naulagak was a type of harpoon used by Angulutiun and Iulutiun hunters.
The naulagak, another variant of the harpoon, featured a wooden or bone shaft that took on the shape of a wishbone at one end. Between the shafts of the wishbone, a separate blade made of bone was firmly affixed. This blade possessed razor-sharp edges on all sides and was positioned in a manner that allowed it to toggle back and forth. Connected to the opposite end of the naulagak was a long cord. Upon piercing an animal, the hunter swiftly jerked the cord, prompting the blade to toggle. This action not only amplified the damage inflicted but also secured the animal to the shaft, significantly reducing its chances of escape.
