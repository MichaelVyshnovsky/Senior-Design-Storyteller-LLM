        "mainbody": "Bastion was a magical tower shield kept at the Old Mans Face in the mid-1480s DR.\nThe shield was extremely large and heavy, and bore enhancements that made it surprisingly adept as a bashing weapon. It also performed admirably in the role of actually protecting the bearer.\nBastion was forged on a distant plane, rather than the Prime Material plane, and saw many battles in its life. It somehow ended up in the possession of Branson Blackboot, the corrupt innkeeper of the Old Mans Face inn, and may have been seized by the Harpers when they searched the inn for a fragment of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll that was hidden there."
