'''''Quarrel's mace''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] bludgeon wielded by an obsessive [[half-drow]] [[warlock]] named [[Quarrel (half-drow)|Quarrel]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This [[mace]] possessed a minor ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand toward the target and increased the weapon's damage. Additionally, it singed the targets with magical flames. It was believed that Quarrel imbued the mace with some of his sour nature and fiery temper.

==History==
Quarrel's mace was the warlock weapon of chose. He carried the bludgeon into battle during the warlock's search for the source of [[Ammon Jerro]]'s arcane powers. The weapon accompanied the half-drow across the [[Sword Coast North]], the [[Mere of Dead Men]], and settled for a while in the [[Crossroad Keep]], before setting out for the land of [[Thay]] some years after the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
