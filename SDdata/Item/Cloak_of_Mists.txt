The Cloak of Mists was a unique enchanted cloak of mysterious origins in the 14 century DR.
This beautiful cloak was made out of strange glowing fabric.
The Cloak of Mists granted the wearer improved defenses against mundane or magical threats and effects. The wearer also was granted the ability to summon a powerful gust of wind once per day.
A strange enigmatic being only known as Metastakixx was trapped in an ancient temple in one of the caves in the Crabs Claw Coast. The beings history was unknown however, it was believed that Metastakixx was an incredibly old creature tasked with protecting remnants of an old and forgotten deity. As of the , Metastakixx was still bound to the temple and waited for the one person destined to let them free. If the strange being was to be freed from the eternal bondage, the Cloak of Mists was sure to be a reward for the kind deed, despite freedom being Metastakixxs doom.
