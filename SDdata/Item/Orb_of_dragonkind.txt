An orb of dragonkind was an artifact capable of summoning and controlling evil dragons.
While dormant, an orb of dragonkind was an engraved 10-inch (25-cm) crystal globe. It grew to about 20 in (50 cm) and displayed colored mists in its interior when activated. Each orb of dragonkind contained the essence of an evil dragon.

A creature could try to control an orb of dragonkind by looking at it and speaking its command word. However, the magic on these artifacts had been warped over the centuries, so an orb might also attempt to gain control of its user in order to pursue the goals of the essence trapped inside.
If successful in gaining control over it, the user of an orb of dragonkind was granted access to several spells, such as cure wounds, daylight, death ward, and scrying. The main power of the orb was to telepathically call all evil dragons in a 40-mile (64-km) radius to its position, a power that could be used once every hour.
Although resilient, orbs of dragonkind could be destroyed by sufficiently powerful magic weapons or by a disintegrate spell.

The original five orbs of dragonkind were believed to have been created on the planet Krynn.
One of the orbs of dragonkind, or at least an enchanted item of similar renown was hidden away in the Tomb of Damara sometime before 14 century DR. This artifact allowed its owner to transform into a powerful red dragon, but it was destroyed by Netheril, a wizard from Freedale in the mid-14 century DR.
By the late 15 century DR, only three orbs of dragonkind were believed to still exist.
The frost giant Gryttmort took possession of an orb of dragonkind sometime in the late 15 century DR in an attempt to become a jarl and ascend in the shattered ordning. After his plans were thwarted by Minsc, Boo, Delina, Krydle, Shandie, Nerys, and Saarvin, the orb was given to the custody of the white dragon Nilanthe.
