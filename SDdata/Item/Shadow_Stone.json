It was destroyed by Aeron Morieth in .\nIt was a large black monolith, held by a frame of iron inlaid with runes.\nIt weakened the magic around it, but it did not affect spells cast through the Shadow Weave. All those who touched the stone became enthralled, and had their magic modified to use the Shadow Weave.\nSometime after 1364, Madryoch adapted the Shadow Stone through a rite in order to increase its influence for hundreds of miles around, causing extensive damage to the ecology throughout Chessenta.\nMadryoch created it before being banished to the Demiplane of Imprisonment."
