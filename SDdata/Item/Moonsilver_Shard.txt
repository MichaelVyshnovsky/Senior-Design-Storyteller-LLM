Moonsilver Shards were enchanted darts that transformed into a small bolt of magical energy once launched.
When launched, Moonsilver Shards burst into magical energy and almost certainly were to hit their targets. The effects of these shards were similar to those of the magic missile spell.
In the late 14 century DR, Moonsilver Shards could be found in the Moonsea region.
