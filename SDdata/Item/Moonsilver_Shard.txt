'''''Moonsilver Shards''''' were [[enchanted]] [[dart]]s that transformed into a small bolt of magical energy once launched.

==Powers==
When launched, ''Moonsilver Shards'' burst into magical energy and almost certainly were to hit their targets. The effects of these shards were similar to those of the ''[[magic missile]]'' spell.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Moonsilver Shards'' could be found in the [[Moonsea]] region.
