A cloak of many colors was a rare enchanted item that provided immunities to the wearer by shifting its color pigments.
Though the cloak always looked the same to the wearer, others would see a constantly changing surface of swirling patterns.
The color-shifting of this item protected the wearer against the effects of a prismatic wall, prismatic sphere, and color spray, and even allowed the wearer to pass through the prismatic barriers unhindered. The cloak also protected the wearer from blindness caused by spells such as blur, pyrotechnics, hypnotic pattern, and darkness, as well as all other forms of blinding light.
The cloaks swirling surface made it slightly easier for the wearer to blend in with shadows. The cloak could glow similar to a light spell for nine minutes at a time once every two hours.
