==Description==
Pizza was a type of baked food found throughout the Western Heartlands along the shores of the [[River Chionthar]]. It was a savory dish consisting of a flat, round base of dough baked with a topping of no fewer than three different [[cheese]]s, typically with added [[sausage]]. A pizza usually weighed about {{SI|1|pound|long=yes}} and sold for 15 [[gp]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==History==
Apart from Baldurian flatbreads, pizza was a treat found on the world of [[Earth]]. [[The Wizards Three]]â€“[[Elminster]], [[Ruatheene]], and Mordenkainen, partook in Earth's pizza during their visits to the home of [[Ed Greenwood]]. The Old Mage liked his pizza with extra [[garlic]] and Ruatheene plotted to spread pralines'n'cream [[ice cream]] over the pie.{{Cite dragon/238/The Return of the Wizards Three|46}}
