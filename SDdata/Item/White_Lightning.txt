White Lightning was a strong alcoholic drink served at the rowdy Jack Jaw tavern in the city of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
The White Lightning drink was created sometime before the late 14 century DR and served exclusively at the Jack Jaw, or "Da Jaaaaw," as locals called it. One of the Jaws bouncers, the insane dwarf named Quillion, developed a weakness for White Lightning. The drink was strong enough to get a tough dwarf like him drunk after only fifteen tankards.
