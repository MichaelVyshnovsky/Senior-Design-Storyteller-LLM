        "mainbody": "A battle gorget was a type of magical gorget that protected the wearers neck and throat from damage.\nThe gorget consisted of a metal throat-shield and a series of overlapping metal plates that encircled the neck. The entire device was connected to a belt made of leather.\nWhen worn, the battle gorget protected the wearer from physical strangulation such as the case if they were hung by a noose.\nOnce per day the wearer could evoke the effects of the spells lesser ironguard, repulsion and firebeam. If the wearer of the gorget were to fall from a significant distance, they could ease their descent as if they had cast the spell feather fall. This power could be used twice per day.\n* Manshoon The infamous archmage and founder of the Zhentarim"
