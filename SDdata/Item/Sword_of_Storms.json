        "mainbody": "The Sword of Storms was a magical sword and artifact created by Maerklos \"Stormherald\", considered to be the first and the greatest of the warrior-priests of Talos the Destroyer.\nLegend had it that the Sword of Storms could control the weather, launch lightning bolts, and hurl gusts of wind whenever the wielder wished (but only one at a time). It could also completely protect the wielder from all effects of winds, conjured gases, rains, magical fogs, lightning, and cold, and could also protect all within a  sphere if the wielder wished.\nMaerklos worked with over a dozen wizards in the forging and enchanting of the Sword of Storms.\nThe sword was later lost, long before the mid–14 century DR, but was thought to be somewhere in Turmish, becoming one of the most famous treasure tales of the realm. Treasure hunters searched the land for the Sword of Storms, but it was commonly thought to be in the cellars or sewers of Alaghôn, the capital city.\nBy 1360 DR, two rival sects of the church of Talos focused their efforts there those of the northern Realms who venerated their god as Talos, the Leaping Lightning, and those of the southern Realms, who venerated their god as Bhaelros, the Divine Wind. They tended to meet in Turmish and fight for dominance, waging magical battles in Alaghôns streets at night, That one had not yet claimed victory over the other implied the Sword of Storms still had not been found."
