It could also completely protect the wielder from all effects of winds, conjured gases, rains, magical fogs, lightning, and cold, and could also protect all within a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes|adj=wide}} sphere if the wielder wished.",
        "History": "Maerklos worked with over a dozen [[wizard]]s in the forging and [[item enchantment|enchanting]] of the Sword of Storms.\n\nThe sword was later lost, long before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], but was thought to be somewhere in [[Turmish]], becoming one of the most famous treasure tales of the realm. Treasure hunters searched the land for the Sword of Storms, but it was commonly thought to be in the cellars or sewers of [[Alaghôn]], the capital city.\n\nBy [[1360 DR]], two rival sects of the [[church of Talos]] focused their efforts there: those of the northern Realms who venerated their god as Talos, the Leaping Lightning, and those of the southern Realms, who venerated their god as Bhaelros, the Divine Wind. They tended to meet in Turmish and fight for dominance, waging magical battles in Alaghôn's streets at night, That one had not yet claimed victory over the other implied the Sword of Storms still had not been found."
