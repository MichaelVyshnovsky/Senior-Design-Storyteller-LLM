'''''Armors of concealed wizardry''''' were special suits of armor whose enchantments were hidden from magical detection. Shields also fell into this group. These items originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

The magic of these items prevented spells such as ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', and ''[[identify]]'' from revealing the magical nature of the armor or shield in question, including whether or not the armor was even magical.

[[Rawun]]s and [[barber]]s were able to use their special skills to determine the basic magical nature of these items.
