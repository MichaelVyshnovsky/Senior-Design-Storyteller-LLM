Armors of concealed wizardry were special suits of armor whose enchantments were hidden from magical detection. Shields also fell into this group. These items originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The magic of these items prevented spells such as detect magic, legend lore, and identify from revealing the magical nature of the armor or shield in question, including whether or not the armor was even magical.
Rawuns and barbers were able to use their special skills to determine the basic magical nature of these items.
