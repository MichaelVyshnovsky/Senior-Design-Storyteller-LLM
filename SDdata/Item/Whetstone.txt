A '''whetstone''' was a stone tool used to sharpen [[blade]]s and other utensils.

==Description==
Whetstones were sold and used in many places over [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Zakhara]]. [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] sold flat whetstones for 2 [[cp]] each.

Whetstones were used by many races across the [[Realms]], from [[dwarves]] to [[giants]].

As well as being used as tools, whetstones were used as [[metamagic]] [[spell]] components. Whetstones constructed from tombstones were required for extending ''[[disrupting weapon]]'' and those from [[pyrite]] were required for extending ''[[keen edge]]''.

==Notable Whetstones==
* ''[[Augmenting whetstone]]s'', [[magic]]al whetstones that gave items touched to them a temporary damage enchantment.
* The ''[[whetstone of sharpening]]'' was a magic whetstone that was claimed from the depths of [[Undermountain]]. The unique item could sharpen blades to a point at which they had a greater chance to hit, and even deal greater damage.
* ''[[Whetstone of keen edge|Whetstones of keen edge]]'', magical whetstones carried by [[duergar]], [[urdunnir]], and [[shield dwarves]].
* ''[[Prismal's whetstone]]'', a magical stone that removed rust and dullness from blades. It temporarily made the blade more likely to hit an opponent and deal more damage.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Artus Cimber]], the guardian of the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'', carried a sharpening stone for his trusted enchanted [[dagger]], the ''[[Bookmark]]''.
* [[Twoedge]], a businessman that lived in [[Skullport]]. He made a living from sharpening blades and offered his services to others. He also owned the magical ''whetstone of sharpening'', which he would use on other's [[sword]]s and [[dagger]]s for the price of 50 [[gp]] per use.
