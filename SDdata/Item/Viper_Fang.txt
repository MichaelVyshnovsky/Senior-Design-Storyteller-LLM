The Viper Fang was the enchanted dagger that dripped with poison akin to an actual fang of a viper.
The Viper Fang was unassuming in appearance apart from the always wet edge of the daggers blade that constantly exuded extremely potent venom or poison.
This dagger possessed a 3 enchantment. Additionally, it was coated in strong magically generating poison. When this poison was introduced into a targets bloodstream, it started weakening them, withering the creatures muscles. Just several shallow cuts could easily bring down even the lightest warriors.
In 1373 DR, the Viper Fang could be found in the Moonsea region, the vicinity of Elventree.
