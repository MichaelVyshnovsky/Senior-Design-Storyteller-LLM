A '''''potion of diminution''''' was an ingestible [[potion]] that temporarily reduced its drinker's size, while '''''oil of diminution''''' acted in a similar factions but was applied topically.

==Description==
The liquid of a ''potion of diminution'' was mostly clear, with a red area that contracted to the size of a small dot and then expanded until it colored the entire [[vial]]. This process could not be stopped even by shaking the vial.

==Powers==
Drinking a ''potion of diminution'' granted the effects of the ''reduce'' part of the ''[[enlarge/reduce]]'' spell for up to 4 hours, with no need for the drinker to keep concentrating on the spell.

==Creation==
The oil version of this concoction could be applied topically, by smashing the vial on an enemy, or applied to a weapon. The oil could be produced via alchemy, by mixing essence of [[sylvan stone]] and certain types of suspension.
