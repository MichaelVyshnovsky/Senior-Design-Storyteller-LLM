A potion of diminution was an ingestible potion that temporarily reduced its drinkers size, while oil of diminution acted in a similar factions but was applied topically.
The liquid of a potion of diminution was mostly clear, with a red area that contracted to the size of a small dot and then expanded until it colored the entire vial. This process could not be stopped even by shaking the vial.
Drinking a potion of diminution granted the effects of the reduce part of the enlarge/reduce spell for up to 4 hours, with no need for the drinker to keep concentrating on the spell.
The oil version of this concoction could be applied topically, by smashing the vial on an enemy, or applied to a weapon. The oil could be produced via alchemy, by mixing essence of sylvan stone and certain types of suspension.
