Linebreaker boots were a type of magical boots that bolstered the wearers combat prowess whenever they ran headfirst into battle.
The lightweight boots were crafted from leather and lined with some type of animal fur.
When the wearer of linebreaker boots dashed into a fight, adrenaline surged through their body and gained increased ferocity in battle.
