The '''''sword of the believer''''' was a magical weapon that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|44}}

==Description==
These weapons were available in any type of sword.

==Powers==
A ''sword of the believer'' was only able to cause physical harm to an [[Zakharan pantheon|unenlightened]] person or creature. True believers who accepted the Law of the [[Loregiver]] could not be harmed in any way by these weapons. In fact, the sword would harmlessly pass through a believer as if they were ethereal.

These swords could be used to easily test if someone was enlightened.
