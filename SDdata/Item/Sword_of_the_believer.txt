The sword of the believer was a magical weapon that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These weapons were available in any type of sword.
A sword of the believer was only able to cause physical harm to an unenlightened person or creature. True believers who accepted the Law of the Loregiver could not be harmed in any way by these weapons. In fact, the sword would harmlessly pass through a believer as if they were ethereal.
These swords could be used to easily test if someone was enlightened.
