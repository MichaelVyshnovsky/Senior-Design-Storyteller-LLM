Blades of larceny were the scimitars of choice among the members of Myth Drannors Thieves Guild before the Weeping War and the fall of the city.
These ornate blades bore distinct markings of the Myth Drannor Thieves Guild.
These scimitars could only be used by rogues and their magics improved the owners dexterity, along with bearing the +2 combat enchantment.
In the glory days of Myth Drannor, these magic scimitars were a telltale sign of their owners belonging to the local Thieves Guild.
Centuries after the fall of the once glorious city, in 1369 DR one of these enchanted rogue weapons could be found in one of the rooms of the Bedlam Prison in Dwarven Dungeons under ruined Myth Drannor. That blades of larceny was held by the dwarves and the prisons lockmaster after being confiscated from some unlucky thief.
