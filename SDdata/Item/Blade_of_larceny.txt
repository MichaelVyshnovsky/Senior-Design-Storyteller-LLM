'''''Blades of larceny''''' were the [[scimitar]]s of choice among the members of [[Myth Drannor]]'s Thieves' Guild before the [[Weeping War]] and the fall of the city.

==Description==
These ornate blades bore distinct markings of the Myth Drannor Thieves' Guild.

==Powers==
These scimitars could only be used by [[rogues]] and their magics improved the owner's dexterity, along with bearing the +2 combat enchantment.

==History==
In the glory days of Myth Drannor, these magic scimitars were a telltale sign of their owners' belonging to the local Thieve's Guild.

Centuries after the fall of the once glorious city, in [[1369 DR]] one of these enchanted rogue weapons could be found in one of the rooms of the [[Bedlam Prison]] in [[Dwarven Dungeons]] under ruined Myth Drannor. That ''blades of larceny'' was held by the dwarves and the prison's lockmaster after being confiscated from some unlucky thief.
