        "mainbody": "Corrosive was a weapon quality that could be applied to magic weapons, making them acidic.\nUpon command from its wielder, the weapon would become thickly covered in slick acidic liquid. The wielder was immune to this liquid, but it had a corrosive effect on those it struck. Applying this quality to ranged weapons would give the effects to their ammunition.\nThe spells acid fog, acid storm, Melfs acid arrow, or storm of vengeance were needed to create a corrosive weapon.\nThe followers of Ghaunadaur, Kiaransalee, Selvetarm would receive a +1 corrosive enchantment from casting the spell weapon of the deity and holding that deitys favored weapon. These weapons were a warhammer, dagger, and heavy mace, respectively.\n* Blingdenstone warpick"
