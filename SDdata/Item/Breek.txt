Breek was a soup served at the Flying Stag inn, in Voonlar circa the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR.
Breek was prepared by boiling beef from all parts of a cow (including hooves) into a broth and then straining out the solid bits. This broth then became the stock for a soup of wild onions, radishes, and hot spices.
