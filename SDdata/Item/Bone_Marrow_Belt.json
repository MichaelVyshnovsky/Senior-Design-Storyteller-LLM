        "mainbody": "The '''''Bone Marrow Belt''''' was a strange enchanted [[belt]] that granted defensive boons to wearers at a price.",
        "Appearance": "Aptly named ''Bone Marrow Belt'' was crafted out of bone and was of the unappealing color of bone marrow.",
        "Powers": "Like many other magical items, the ''Bone Marrow Belt'' adjusted its size to fit snugly around any [[humanoid]]'s waist. However, once the belt was on, its enchantments gave the wearer a sickly unhealthy appearance that negatively affected their charisma. In exchange for the unappealing frail appearance, the ''Bone Marrow Belt'' increased the wearer's defense and made them resistant to slashing damage and somewhat vulnerable to blunt weapons.\n\nThe belt's enchantments did not allow good-aligned creatures to wear it.",
        "History": "In [[1281 DR]], the ''Bone Marrow Belt'' was worn by one of the monstrous giant [[skeleton]]s with serrated blades for hands, that guarded the third floor of the ruined [[Hand of the Seldarine]]."
