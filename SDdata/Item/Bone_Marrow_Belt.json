        "mainbody": "The Bone Marrow Belt was a strange enchanted belt that granted defensive boons to wearers at a price.\nAptly named Bone Marrow Belt was crafted out of bone and was of the unappealing color of bone marrow.\nLike many other magical items, the Bone Marrow Belt adjusted its size to fit snugly around any humanoids waist. However, once the belt was on, its enchantments gave the wearer a sickly unhealthy appearance that negatively affected their charisma. In exchange for the unappealing frail appearance, the Bone Marrow Belt increased the wearers defense and made them resistant to slashing damage and somewhat vulnerable to blunt weapons.\nThe belts enchantments did not allow good-aligned creatures to wear it.\nIn 1281 DR, the Bone Marrow Belt was worn by one of the monstrous giant skeletons with serrated blades for hands, that guarded the third floor of the ruined Hand of the Seldarine."
