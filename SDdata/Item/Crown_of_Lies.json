        "mainbody": "he Crown of Lies was an artifact that granted its wearer the ability to perfectly transform into any seen creature. Additionally, any lies spoken while in the new form would appear as truth to both mundane and magical senses.\nThe crown was crafted from burnished and intertwined metal rods.\nIn order to attune with the Crown of Lies, its user should place it on their head and speak their hearts true desire.\nThe crowns wearer could assume the form and feel of any creature theyd seen, as long as the creatures size didnt deviate too far from the wearers own size, generally within a range of half or double the wearers size. No form of magical or mundane scrutiny would reveal details about the nature of the transformation, nor would it detect lies spoken as the new form. The crown would meld into the wearers new form, thus rendering it undetectable. However, the wearer could choose to make the crown visible at will. The transformation would last until the wearer died, the attunement with the crown was broken, or the wearer used its powers to assume a new form.\nThe Crown of Lies would be permanently destroyed if the wearer was killed by the creature they were transformed into.\n* Kas, who found the crown in a hidden forge in the Shadowfell."
