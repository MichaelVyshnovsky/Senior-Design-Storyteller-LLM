Pride of Velen was one of the more notable dishes from the city of Velen in the nation of Tethyr.
Pride of Velen was an impressive wild rice dish served on a large platter, shaped to resemble castle battlements. The rice segregated several foods from each other. On one side were snails in brandy and lemon sauce, on the other turkey meat in a decadent white wine sauce with a light flavor of onion, and cooked swords and mushrooms.
As of the late 14 century DR, Pride of Velen could be found on the menu at Blackthorns Brew, a festhall on the Captains Cliff in Velen. The dish was among the notable foods included in Volothamp Geddarms published guide to Amn and Tethyr.
