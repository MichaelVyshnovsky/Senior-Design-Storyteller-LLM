An '''''item of cloaked wizardry''''' was any magic item that, in addition to possessing a regular enchantment, was also undetectable as a magic item from spells. These items originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Powers==
''Items of cloaked wizardry'' revealed nothing when a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell was cast upon them. However, other [[divination]] spells such as ''[[identify]]'' would reveal the magical enchantment inherent in the item.
