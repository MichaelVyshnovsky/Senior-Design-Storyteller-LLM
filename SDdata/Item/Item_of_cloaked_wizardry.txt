An item of cloaked wizardry was any magic item that, in addition to possessing a regular enchantment, was also undetectable as a magic item from spells. These items originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Items of cloaked wizardry revealed nothing when a detect magic spell was cast upon them. However, other divination spells such as identify would reveal the magical enchantment inherent in the item.
