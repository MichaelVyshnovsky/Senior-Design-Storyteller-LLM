        "Description": "Gypsum was a relatively soft mineral. A test could be used to determine its authenticity – gypsum could not be scratched by a fingernail but rather by using a [[copper]] or [[bronze]] [[coin]].{{Cite dragon/248/Crystal Confusion|41}} [[Satin spar]] was a type of gypsum mineral, also known as feather gypsum, that was used in gem-cutting.{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|16}}",
        "Usage": "The city of [[Ankhapur]] in the [[Land of the Lions]] had walls that looked to be made of white gypsum, though tarnished in appearance.\n\nThe [[Mulhorand]]i deity [[Geb]] had his temples constructed to be living caverns adorned with mineral formations, including gypsum flowers.",
        "Availability": "Gypsum was found within the rocks of the great desert of [[Anauroch]] in [[North Faerûn]]. Deposits of the substance were broken off and harvested by the [[Bedine]] [[human]]s along with the less valuable gypsum dust.\n\n''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold gypsum in eight-ounce bags for a single [[silver]] [[coin|piece]], available from the Wizard's Laboratory of the catalogue.\n\n[[Crystal flower]]s of the [[Underdark]] were beautiful natural mineral formations of [[halite]], gypsum, and other substances. They were valued by the sentient inhabitants of the Underdark for their beauty.\n\nThe scales of [[radiant dragon]]s consisted of glistening [[mica]] and gypsum."
