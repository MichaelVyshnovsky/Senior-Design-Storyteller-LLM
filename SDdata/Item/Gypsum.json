Deposits of the substance were broken off and harvested by the Bedine humans along with the less valuable gypsum dust.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold gypsum in eight-ounce bags for a single silver piece, available from the Wizards Laboratory of the catalogue.\nCrystal flowers of the Underdark were beautiful natural mineral formations of halite, gypsum, and other substances. They were valued by the sentient inhabitants of the Underdark for their beauty.\nThe scales of radiant dragons consisted of glistening mica and gypsum."
