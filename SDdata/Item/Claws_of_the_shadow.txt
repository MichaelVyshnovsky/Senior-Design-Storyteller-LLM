The claws of the shadow were enchanted bagh nagh favored by cultists of Kiga in Zakhara.
The strength of enchantment on these items varied but they were usually found as a pair. The enchantment allowed the claws to strike true and, if worn together, a pair would grant the wielder the ability to assume shadow form once per day.
