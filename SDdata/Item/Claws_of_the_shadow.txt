The '''''claws of the shadow''''' were enchanted ''[[tiger's claws|bagh nagh]]'' favored by cultists of [[Kiga]] in [[Zakhara]].

==Powers==
The strength of enchantment on these items varied but they were usually found as a pair. The enchantment allowed the claws to strike true and, if worn together, a pair would grant the wielder the ability to assume ''[[shadow form]]'' once per day.
