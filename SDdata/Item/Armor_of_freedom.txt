'''''Armor of freedom''''' was a set of enchanted [[heavy armor]] that allowed the wearer to move freely when restrained by magical means.

==Powers==
''Armor of freedom'' possessed a ''+3'' enchantment. Additionally, the armor's wearer was under the effects of the ''[[freedom]]'' spell.

==History==
The first ''armor of freedom'' was developed by a warrior-[[priest]] [[Archiel]] after he survived magical imprisonment. Archiel made a vow to himself never to be restrained by spells. He spent years forging ''armors of freedom'' for his own use and his companions. Ironically enough, Archiel's life ended being imprisoned with no magics holding him there, apart from ordinary iron chains.

These armors became more common in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], found in several cities across the [[Sword Coast]], [[Neverwinter]], and the [[Moonsea]] region.
