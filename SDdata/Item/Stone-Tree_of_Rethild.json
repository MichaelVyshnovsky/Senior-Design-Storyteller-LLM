        "mainbody": "The '''Stone-Tree of Rethild''' was a, presumably, unique stone or [[petrified]] [[tree]] found in the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]] in [[Dambrath]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This item resembled a tree covered in spine-like stone protrusions growing out of the central sinus tentacle-like trunk that spiraled up from the rest of the tree. The Stone-Tree of Rethild was always warm to the touch. However, it was unknown if it possessed any magic.",
        "History": "This strange object was recovered from the depths of an unnamed ruin in the Great Swamp of Rethild before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. It found its way into the collection within the curio store in [[Westgate]] run by [[Mintassan]] the Magnificent, where it was proudly displayed to his customers."
