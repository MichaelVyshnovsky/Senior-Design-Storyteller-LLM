Elvish seedcakes or simply seedcakes, were sweet bread-like treats that came in loaves and in bite-sized handfood shapes.
Elvish seedcakes were delectable breads, baked with crushed aniseed, caraway, and coriander seeds. Some versions of these treats possessed magical capabilities to cure moderate wounds on the imbiber.
In the late 14 century DR, small-sized handfood seedcakes were available in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep. In 1372 DR, Alicine Bricket and Muriel Bricket, served neatly individually wrapped elvish seedcakes during a party in their Western Heartlands summer home, outside Daggerford, in celebration of their brother Elveronne Brickets demise.
