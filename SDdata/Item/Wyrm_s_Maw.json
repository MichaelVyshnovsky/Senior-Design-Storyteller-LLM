        "mainbody": "'''''Wyrm's Maw''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] crafted out of the remains of the great white wyrm named [[Frostmaw]] some years before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "''Wyrm's Maw'' was created using hide, bone, heavy gray-white scales, skull, and jaws of Frostmaw. The helmet completely covered the face of the individual who wore in.",
        "Powers": "Once per day, the wearer could unleash a deadly roaring blast cold.",
        "History": "''Wyrm's Maw'' was created after Frostmaw, a great white wyrm, so fierce and huge it could rival a true [[white dragon]], was defeated and slain by the hero [[ranger]] named [[Kellem Longeyes]] of the [[Ten-Towns]]. The helmet was imbued with Frostmaw's deadly frigid breath. Many years after ''Wyrm's Maw's'' creation, Kellem Longeyes embarked on the one last hunt into the spires of the [[Spine of the World]] and never returned.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Kellem's helmet was recovered from a nest of two white dragons and their white wyrms in the [[River Caves]] just south of the Spine of the World, from whence the [[Black Raven River]] began its run south across the [[Cold Marshes]]."
