Phaens robe of rags was an ordinary-looking yet enchanted robe that once belonged to Phaen of the Rags in the early 14 century DR.
Phaens robe of rags was just that, a robe sewn together of numerous mismatched ragged strips of cloth. Despite being a magic item, it looked like something a beggar from Luskan could wear. On the inside, the robe was lined with bears pelt.
Enchantments were weaved into the robes fabric. It granted the wearer a +2 defensive enchantment and protected them from the normal and magical cold. Phaens robe of rags was masterfully enchanted, and its magics were virtually undetectable even to most experienced wizards.
In the , this robe was worn by Phaen of the Rags, an outcast mage from Luskans Arcane Brotherhood. He eventually joined the Legion of the Chimera that threatened the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale with destruction. In Mirtul of the , Phaen pretended to be a lowly beggar in Targos while spying for the Legion and magically transporting goblin marauders past the citys walls and fortifications. When his allegiance was revealed, Phaen was slain by a band of mercenaries from Targos and the enchanted robes left his possession.
