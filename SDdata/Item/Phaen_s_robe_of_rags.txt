'''''Phaen's robe of rags''''' was an ordinary-looking yet [[enchanted]] [[robe]] that once belonged to [[Phaen of the Rags]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Phaen's robe of rags'' was just that, a robe sewn together of numerous mismatched ragged strips of cloth. Despite being a [[magic item]], it looked like something a beggar from [[Luskan]] could wear. On the inside, the robe was lined with [[bear]]'s pelt.

==Powers==
Enchantments were weaved into the robe's fabric. It granted the wearer a ''+2'' defensive enchantment and protected them from the normal and magical cold. ''Phaen's robe of rags'' was masterfully enchanted, and its magics were virtually undetectable even to most experienced [[wizard]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, this robe was worn by Phaen of the Rags, an outcast mage from Luskan's [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. He eventually joined the [[Legion of the Chimera]] that threatened the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]] with destruction. In [[Mirtul]] of the {{Yearlink|1312}}, Phaen pretended to be a lowly beggar in [[Targos]] while spying for the Legion and magically transporting [[goblin]] marauders past the city's walls and fortifications. When his allegiance was revealed, Phaen was slain by a band of mercenaries from Targos and the enchanted robes left his possession.
