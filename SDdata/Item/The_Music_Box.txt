The Music Box was a devious and exotic torture device.
This mechanism, was  facetiously called for its functionality and form. The Music Box was a humanoid-sized cage with its bars created out of tuning forks. Once hit, the cage started reverberating with high-pitched tones, eventually driving the victim locked inside insane and causing profuse ear bleeding.
In 1372 DR, one of these devices could be found in Daggerfords curio shop, Stop Hole Abbey. However, at the time, the Music Box was not for sale as per the store owner, Vladmyr.
