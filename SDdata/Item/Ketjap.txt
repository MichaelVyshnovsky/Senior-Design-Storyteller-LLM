'''Ketjap''' was a condiment found in the [[Shining Lands]] in [[1367 DR]]. It was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Description==
Ketjap was made by combining [[mingari]] from [[Ulgarth]] with rare fruits from [[Maztica]]. This thick and spicy sauce had a unique flavor, making it a prized commodity in the [[Shining South]]. It was a good condiment for otherwise ordinary grilled or roasted meats.

==History==
Ketjap was created in [[Durpar]] by chefs said to be working in the kitchens of caliphs and viziers. ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'' brought it to western [[Faer√ªn]] for the first time, where it was thought to come from the lands east of Durpar (that is, Ulgarth).
