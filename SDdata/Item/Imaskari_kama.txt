Imaskari kamas were exotic weapons enchanted with the ability to cause acid damage. They may have been created by the Imaskari, given the tainted aura they showed, but rather probably were modeled after Imaskari devices.
Besides being enchanted, imaskari kamas dealt as much acid damage as they dealt slashing.
