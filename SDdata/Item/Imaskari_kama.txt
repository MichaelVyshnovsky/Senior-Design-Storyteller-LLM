'''Imaskari kamas''' were exotic weapons [[enchanted]] with the ability to cause acid damage. They may have been created by the [[Artificer (Imaskari)|Imaskari]], given the tainted aura they showed, but rather probably were modeled after Imaskari devices.

==Powers==
Besides being enchanted, imaskari kamas dealt as much [[acid]] damage as they dealt slashing.
