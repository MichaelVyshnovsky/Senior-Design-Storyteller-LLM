Hornbill ivory was not really ivory, it was material from the beak of the hornbill bird.
The hornbill bird in the realms was a large bird with gray plumage and a heavy beak. The sturdy beak could be carved like ivory, and was used to make personal items like combs or beads. It was also used as an inlay in stone or wooden furniture. A typical price was 7 silver pieces per pound (0.45kg).
