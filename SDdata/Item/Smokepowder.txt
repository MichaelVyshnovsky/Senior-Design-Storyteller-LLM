'''Smokepowder''' was a magical alchemical equivalent of [[gunpowder]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}} 

==Description==
Bearing a resemblance to gunpowder, it was a coarse dark gray powder that exploded when exposed to fire or heat, producing force, noise, and smoke. However, smokepowder differed by being magical in nature. Also like gunpowder, it burned rapidly and was rendered unusable when exposed to water, though it was not explosive. The scale of explosion was in accordance with the amount used. Two spoonfuls (one of each component) was sufficient for a large firecracker or a single [[arquebus]] shot. More could create explosions of significant size and force.

Smokepowder was typically sold and carried within either small wooden [[powderkeg]]s or in [[powder horn]]s. A pouch held enough for eighteen shots of an arquebus.

Those who used the substance on a frequent basis found that their fingers or gloves were left stained by it. And small, magically limited kernels of the substance were known as '''fireseeds'''.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-07-20 - Firecrackers & Fireworks in the Realms}}

==Creation==
The exact formula for creating smokepowder was a secret closely guarded by the [[Church of Gond]],{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-10 - Making Smokepowder}} what they referred to as a "temple secret." They would never make the substance in front of outsiders or discuss its making with them. That being said, quite a few people outside of the clergy had figured out the ingredients, including a handful of [[alchemist]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[wizard]]s.

Some believed the formula involved the mixture of two inert substances: It was reported that [[crystalmist]]s could be used to make a high-quality smokepowder. The alchemist [[Surero]] claimed to use a combination of 75% [[sulfur]], 10% [[saltpeter]], and 15% [[charcoal]] mixed together in sacks to create the substance.<ref><ref group="note" name="ingredients">It should be noted though that Ed Greenwood stated in one [https://web.archive.org/web/20210517004301/https://twitter.com/jvcparry/status/867391458827005953 tweet] that smokepowder had completely different ingredients from gunpowder. At least one of the formula's known ingredients was magical in nature and circumvented Gond's prohibition on explosives.

[[File:Smoke powder blast.jpg|thumb|right|''Experimenting with smokepowder had a tendency to blow up in one's face.'']]
Beyond the formula itself, the process of making smokepowder was difficult and fraught with danger, often ending in an unplanned explosion. This was because only those in the Church of Gond knew the precise proportions for the ingredients and how to mix them in order to make functional smokepowder. For those outside the clergy, determining these measurements and mixtures was a matter of (often dangerous) experimentation.

Gondsmen had their own special tricks for making the powder, which they often expedited with spells. The first was a way of getting three dry ingredients to bond and another was ensuring the final mixture stayed bonded.

==Availability==
Smokepowder was generally quite rare and difficult to obtain.

In the land of [[Shou Lung]], one could find smokepowder for sale in the city of [[Chunming]].<ref>

===Beyond Toril===
* The prevalence of smokepowder was far greater in [[Wildspace]] than it was on planets, being a particularly good seller for the merchants known as [[the Arcane]].
* On [[Oerth]], smokepowder was an inert substance, not functioning until it was taken off the planet.<ref> However, [[cleric]]s of the Oerthian god of science, [[Murlynd]], were capable of making smokepowder function by concentrating on it with their [[divine magic]].

==History==
[[File:Smokepowder bomb.png|thumb|''A gnomish-invented smokepowder bomb.'']]
Smokepowder was first introduced to Toril hundreds of years prior to [[1358 DR]], when [[spelljammer]]s came to Shou Lung in search of resources and trades. These vessels had failed to properly hide or safeguard it from the [[Shou]], who would take it{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-03-17 - Shou Discovery of Smokepowder}} and go on to develop [[fireworks]] and [[firecracker]]s that would be used in much of [[Kara-Tur]] for centuries to come.<ref> However, beyond Kara-Tur the substance never saw extensive research or development into its use.

This was until the [[Time of Troubles]] in 1358 DR, when the craftsmen deity [[Gond]] was forced to wander Toril in a mortal [[avatar]] form and one day washed up on the shores of [[Lantan]]. In return for the people there sheltering his avatar, Gond revealed the secrets of smokepowder to the Lantanese,

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the city-state of [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] made use of smokepowder to excavate the trench for a canal that was dug between the Lake of Steam and the [[Nagaflow]].<ref>

At some point during this period, the city of [[Waterdeep]] and the nation of [[Cormyr]] had banned the substance, making it a lucrative item for [[smuggler]]s to bring in.<ref>

In [[1369 DR]], a fire broke out in [[Calimport]] that would come to be known as the [[Trades Conflagration]].<ref> Not knowing what the true cause of the fire was, some blamed it on imported smokepowder that was sitting in the overcrowded [[Calimport/Emerald Ward|Marekh Sabban]].<ref>

Around [[1372 DR]], the city of [[Telflamm]] was considered a gateway for smokepowder and other eastern goods into the rest of [[Faerûn]].<ref> Around this time firearms were available throughout [[Faerûn]] and many rulers viewed the Church of Gond with ire for having introduced them to the continent, seeing the weapons as a threat to their authority.<ref> It wasn't long before rulers began putting stricter regulations in place for the substance.

Around this time, following the Lantanna pirate [[Gimlet Watersprecht]]'s creation of a ''[[portal]]'' between Lantan and the [[Pirate Isles]], there was a frightening rise in the number of smokepowder weapons among pirates in the [[Inner Sea]]. This posed a great concern to the kingdom of Cormyr's then-princess and regent, [[Alusair Obarskyr]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of Lantan:Lantan to Pirate Isle}}

===15th century===
Following the destruction of Lantan during the [[Spellplague]], many [[artificer]]s considered the secrets behind smokepowder to have been lost.{{Cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|6}}

During this time, [[Scornubel]] and later [[Downshadow]] and [[Mistshore]], were some of the few places in the Realms where one could openly and freely purchase smokepowder.

Cormyr relaxed its laws on smokepowder during this period, allowing for the importation or creation of the substance so long as one had a license from the Crown. However, these licenses came with a fee of 500 [[gold piece]]s and a variety of conditions. For example, most often the importer wasn't permitted to take the substance into [[Arabel]] or further south than [[Waymoot]]. Their licensing fee paid for two [[War Wizard]]s and two members of the [[Purple Dragons]] to watch over the substance.

In addition to the license, those importing smokepowder to Cormyr were required to give a detailed report to a War Wizard or their second-in-command that explained their reasons for importing it, where and how it would be stored in the meantime, and when it would be used, among other other things. Approval was generally more lenient for those who cited a desire to conquer the [[Stonelands]]. Furthermore, any attempts to sell, gift, or hide smokepowder would result in a confiscation order that would be carried out by dozens of ruthless War Wizards and Purple Dragons.

By [[1480 DR]], smokepowder was still largely a banned substance in Waterdeep. The people who had official access to it were guardsmen. To a limited degree, members of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors|Watchful Order]] also had access for the purposes of experimentation, though such experiments had to be observed and supervised by officials. Around this same time, the substance could be covertly bought in small quantities at the black markets of [[Luskan]] and [[Westgate]], though one was liable to attract the attention of spies.

==Reputation==
Across the Realms, many had misconceptions regarding the safety and effectiveness of this substance. It was most often viewed as being unreliable and some form of dangerous or corruptive [[magic]]. Smokepowder had a similar reputation among inhabitants of the [[Demiplane of Dread]], especially the [[Vistani]].

==Notable Users of Smokepowder==
[[File:Smoke Powder Pistol.jpg|thumb|''A smoke powder pistol.'']]
* The [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] were known to have developed large siege guns, known as [[bombard]]s, that operated on smokepowder. However, these were largely inaccurate and each shot consumed over a hundred charges.
* In the land of Kara-Tur, there were known to be small rockets that were fueled by smokepowder.
* By 1372 DR, the use of smokepowder was known to be quite common among [[rock gnome]]s.
* The armed forces of [[Colletro]], [[Sumbria]], and other city-states of the [[Blade Kingdoms]] used smokepowder to arm the highly controversial arquebus and handgun troops by [[1217 DR]]. That year, a nest of [[rat]]s found a way into the smokepowder stash in the [[Palace of Sumbria]]. The hungry pests gorged on the substance, which let to an infestation of strangely annoying explosive rats that regularly created commotion in the palace.
* [[Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomatra]], the prince of [[Lomatra]] of the Blade Kingdoms crafted gold pouch decoys, filled with smokepowder. Once a pickpocket grabbed the wallet, its long fuse was lit and eventually reached the smokepowder, causing an explosion.
