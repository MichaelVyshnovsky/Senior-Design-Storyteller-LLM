Smokepowder was a magical alchemical equivalent of gunpowder. 
Bearing a resemblance to gunpowder, it was a coarse dark gray powder that exploded when exposed to fire or heat, producing force, noise, and smoke. However, smokepowder differed by being magical in nature. Also like gunpowder, it burned rapidly and was rendered unusable when exposed to water, though it was not explosive. The scale of explosion was in accordance with the amount used. Two spoonfuls (one of each component) was sufficient for a large firecracker or a single arquebus shot. More could create explosions of significant size and force.
Smokepowder was typically sold and carried within either small wooden powderkegs or in powder horns. A pouch held enough for eighteen shots of an arquebus.
Those who used the substance on a frequent basis found that their fingers or gloves were left stained by it. And small, magically limited kernels of the substance were known as fireseeds.
The exact formula for creating smokepowder was a secret closely guarded by the Church of Gond, what they referred to as a "temple secret." They would never make the substance in front of outsiders or discuss its making with them. That being said, quite a few people outside of the clergy had figured out the ingredients, including a handful of alchemists, priests, and wizards.
Some believed the formula involved the mixture of two inert substances It was reported that crystalmists could be used to make a high-quality smokepowder. The alchemist Surero claimed to use a combination of 75% sulfur, 10% saltpeter, and 15% charcoal mixed together in sacks to create the substance.It should be noted though that Ed Greenwood stated in one [https//web.archive.org/web/20210517004301/https//twitter.com/jvcparry/status/867391458827005953 tweet] that smokepowder had completely different ingredients from gunpowder. At least one of the formulas known ingredients was magical in nature and circumvented Gonds prohibition on explosives.
Experimenting with smokepowder had a tendency to blow up in ones face.
Beyond the formula itself, the process of making smokepowder was difficult and fraught with danger, often ending in an unplanned explosion. This was because only those in the Church of Gond knew the precise proportions for the ingredients and how to mix them in order to make functional smokepowder. For those outside the clergy, determining these measurements and mixtures was a matter of (often dangerous) experimentation.
Gondsmen had their own special tricks for making the powder, which they often expedited with spells. The first was a way of getting three dry ingredients to bond and another was ensuring the final mixture stayed bonded.
Smokepowder was generally quite rare and difficult to obtain.
In the land of Shou Lung, one could find smokepowder for sale in the city of Chunming.
* The prevalence of smokepowder was far greater in Wildspace than it was on planets, being a particularly good seller for the merchants known as the Arcane.
* On Oerth, smokepowder was an inert substance, not functioning until it was taken off the planet. However, clerics of the Oerthian god of science, Murlynd, were capable of making smokepowder function by concentrating on it with their divine magic.

* The Red Wizards of Thay were known to have developed large siege guns, known as bombards, that operated on smokepowder. However, these were largely inaccurate and each shot consumed over a hundred charges.
* In the land of Kara-Tur, there were known to be small rockets that were fueled by smokepowder.
* By 1372 DR, the use of smokepowder was known to be quite common among rock gnomes.
* The armed forces of Colletro, Sumbria, and other city-states of the Blade Kingdoms used smokepowder to arm the highly controversial arquebus and handgun troops by 1217 DR. That year, a nest of rats found a way into the smokepowder stash in the Palace of Sumbria. The hungry pests gorged on the substance, which let to an infestation of strangely annoying explosive rats that regularly created commotion in the palace.
* Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomatra, the prince of Lomatra of the Blade Kingdoms crafted gold pouch decoys, filled with smokepowder. Once a pickpocket grabbed the wallet, its long fuse was lit and eventually reached the smokepowder, causing an explosion.
