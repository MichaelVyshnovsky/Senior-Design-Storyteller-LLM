A '''dulcimer''' was a stringed instrument known in the Realms.{{Cite dragon/123/Music of the Forgotten Realms|13}} The [[Zakharan]] version was known as a ''[[santur]]''.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight|84}}

The dulcimer had strings stretched over a sounding board, which was typically trapezoidal in shape. The strings would be plucked or struck with a [[hammer]]. The santur was similar in appearance to the [[qanun]].
