        "mainbody": "The knife of the bowyer was an enchanted knife, used by the best craftsmen of the ancient Myth Drannor.\nThe knife of the bowyer was quite mundane in its appearance, apart from the enchantments that cept the decay and ravages of time away from it.\nThis magic blade was enchanted to dramatically improve the wielders crafting and bowmaking skills.\nThe knife of the bowyer, was displayed within the Artisans Hall within the Crypt of Rothilion. The magic tools could be found in the Fletchers Alcove, the second alcove to the right from the entrance to the tomb. The Crypt of Rothilion was sealed before the advent of hte Weeping War and the fall of Myth Drannor. The tomb remained undisturbed until it was unsealed in 1369 DR buring the Cult of the Dragons attempts to take over the pool of radiance within the ruined City of Song."
