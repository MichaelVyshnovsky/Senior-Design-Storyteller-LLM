        "mainbody": "The Imaskarran Tome of Life was a heavy and tattered tome with a single rune on the cover, translating simply to \"Life\". The book detailed the process of creating a ring of elemental resistance from a quartz crystal and a fenberry, using the spell endure elements.\nEltoora Sarptyl sought, maybe with the help of the Hero of Neverwinter, this tome around Port Llast. Though allegedly of Imaskarran origin, they were readable to the Hero of Neverwinter. It was in the possession of the lich Brother Tomas of the Arcane Brotherhood of Illuskan, having been interred with him."
