        "mainbody": "'''''Thrym extract''''' was dangerous substance harvested from worms that dwelt in the arctic, such as [[remorhaz]]. The extract was most common in the [[north Faer√ªn]], [[Icewind Dale]], and [[Ten Towns]].",
        "Description": "''Thrym'' was extracted and distilled from the glands of creatures like remorhaz. This substance allowed the northern worms to stay warm in harsh freezing environments. When extracted, ''thrym extract'' was a thick liquid, deadly if consumed.",
        "Powers": "''Thrym extract'' was a dangerous substance that proved to be fatal if consumed before significant dilution. Alchemists produced safer distilled extracts that were still not safe for consumption.\n\nIf ingested, ''thrym'' scorched the drinker from the inside, leaving them almost certainly dead. If the creature survived the substance imbibing, they gained immunity to cold temperatures and cold damage.",
        "Availability": "''Circa'' [[1281 DR]], diluted ''thrym extract'' could be purchased from [[Kieran Nye]], the proprietor of the [[Whistling Gallows Inn]] of [[Lonelywood]], [[Ten Towns]]. During the same period of time, a blind [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith [[Tiernon Denthelm]] who resided in the remorhaz-infested cavers of [[Gloomfrost]], extracted ''thrym extract'' for use in his craft and offered it for purchase.",
        "History": "In [[1311 DR]], a [[gnome]] inventor [[Oswald Fiddlebender]] used ''thrym extract'' along with other exotic items to repair his crashed flying ship in [[Icewind Dale]]."
