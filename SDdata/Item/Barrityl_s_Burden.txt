Barrityls Burden was the unique enchanted and cursed ring that could not be removed by any means once it was on someones finger.
This smooth obsidian ring had a red ruby color of blood embedded into it. The gem had a certain hypnotic quality that involuntarily drawn all eyes to it.
Barrityls Burden magics granted its wearer several boons and one major disadvantage. The ring could store spells for its master to call upon at a later date, somewhat commonly used enchantment among capable arcane spellcasters. Once on the wearers finger, the ring also expanded their mind, allowing for additional spells to be memorized at a daily rate. This ability also allowed the wearer to learn and cast spells beyond the casters skill and ability.
This obsidian band also had a chance of spontaneously creating a gemstone each morning. Among the gems willed into existence were fire agates, turquoises, and lynx eyes. If by chance Barrityls Burden failed to create a gem, the ring subjected the wearer to excruciating moment of pain with magical burns that were left by fire, cold, or electricity damage.
And finally, the ring gave its wearer grand disadvantage when trying to ensorcell or battle a djinni. Barrityls Burden staved the wearers hands from hurting the djinni opponent and lightened the spells or blows that successfully landed.
Sometime before 1368 DR, Barrityls Burden was created as a "gift" by djinni Najim for the infamous drow sorcerer proprietor of the Black Pits of Underdark. Najim did not trust the sorcerer, rightfully so, and he weaved an extremely potent curse into this band of obsidian, that heavily disadvantaged the wearer were he ever to attack any djinn. Baeloth Barrityl was unable to remove the rince once he put it one by any means, be it arcane or divine.
In 1368 DR, Barrityls Burden accompanied its drow owner on his unwilling journey across the Sword Coast where he made acquaintance of Abdel Adrian.
