After Randal was abducted, and his men were killed and turned into [[undead]], the sword was used as bait in the tomb to draw adventurers into the machinations of [[Gothyl]]. This former [[wizard]] became an arch-[[shadow]] in her pursuit of [[lich]]dom and her essence was linked to the sword some time before it was discovered by the Dalesman."
