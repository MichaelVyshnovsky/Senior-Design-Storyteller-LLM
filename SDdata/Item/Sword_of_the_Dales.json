        "mainbody": "he sword of the Dales was a \"+3 magical longsword\" with several abilities, and others that had not been discovered. The blade was crafted from polished steel, with a hilt of gold and precious stones. The entire weapon radiated pale blue light.\nThe sword granted the wielder to breathe underwater once per day, per the spell water breathing, and possessed a command word. When the word merrydale was uttered, it would unlock any chains or manacles within 30 feet.\nIt was believed the sword possessed additional abilities, but even after identification, these had not been fully discovered.\nThe sword was created by the weaponsmithing wizard Shraevyn, in 996 DR, and interred it within his his tomb for a couple centuries.\nSometime around 1369 DR the sword was briefly recovered by Randal Morn on an expedition that he and his Freedom Riders took into the tomb of Shraevyn. After Randal was abducted, and his men were killed and turned into undead, the sword was used as bait in the tomb to draw adventurers into the machinations of Gothyl. This former wizard became an arch-shadow in her pursuit of lichdom and her essence was linked to the sword some time before it was discovered by the Dalesman."
