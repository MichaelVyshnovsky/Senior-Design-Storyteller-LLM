        "mainbody": "The '''''ring of Gaxx''''' was a powerful and particularly evil [[magic]] ring owned by the [[demilich]] [[Kangaxx]].",
        "Description": "While it was rather plain in appearance, the ring did feature a faceted [[gem]] with nine different sides. It radiated pure [[evil]] energy that came from the terrible magic it held.",
        "Powers": "The ''ring of Gaxx'' offered many boons to its wearer. It protected them from mundane physical harm, offered them limited resistance to [[spell]]s and magical effects, granted them a form of ''[[regenerate|regeneration]]'', and even rendered them immune to any form of [[poison]] or [[disease]].\n\nUsing the ring's powers, its wearer could ''[[improved invisibility|make themselves invisible for hours at a time]]'', and ''[[improved haste|greatly quicken their actions for a matter of seconds]]''.",
        "History": "The ring was crafted by Kangaxx sometime during the era of ancient [[Netheril]], thousands of years before the [[Era of Upheaval]]. It was believed that the power of the ring's gem was drawn from great death and loss.\n\nIt was interred with Kangaxx in his tomb, within a subterranean crypt in [[west Faerûn|western Faerûn]], atop which was built the city of [[Athkatla]]. The lich's body was sundered to pieces and scattered in various locations, watched over by the very [[Netherese]] [[lich]]es that sought Kangaxx's destruction.",
        "Reputation": "While it was worth a significant sum in [[gp|gold]], most merchants were unwilling to deal with the vile item."
