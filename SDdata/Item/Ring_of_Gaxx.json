        "mainbody": "The ring of Gaxx was a powerful and particularly evil magic ring owned by the demilich Kangaxx.\nWhile it was rather plain in appearance, the ring did feature a faceted gem with nine different sides. It radiated pure evil energy that came from the terrible magic it held.\nThe ring of Gaxx offered many boons to its wearer. It protected them from mundane physical harm, offered them limited resistance to spells and magical effects, granted them a form of regeneration, and even rendered them immune to any form of poison or disease.\nUsing the rings powers, its wearer could make themselves invisible for hours at a time, and greatly quicken their actions for a matter of seconds.\nThe ring was crafted by Kangaxx sometime during the era of ancient Netheril, thousands of years before the Era of Upheaval. It was believed that the power of the rings gem was drawn from great death and loss.\nIt was interred with Kangaxx in his tomb, within a subterranean crypt in western Faer√ªn, atop which was built the city of Athkatla. The lichs body was sundered to pieces and scattered in various locations, watched over by the very Netherese liches that sought Kangaxxs destruction.\nWhile it was worth a significant sum in gold, most merchants were unwilling to deal with the vile item."
