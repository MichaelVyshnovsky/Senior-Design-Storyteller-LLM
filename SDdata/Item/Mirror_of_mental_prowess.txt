A '''''mirror of mental prowess''''' was a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[mirror]] that could be found in the Realms.

==Description==
A ''mirror of mental prowess'' largely resembled an ordinary mirror. On average it measured about {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} wide.

==Powers==
These mirrors had a variety of magical abilities that could be accessed by stating the proper commands. These abilities encompassed the following:
* Allowing one to read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, regardless of their languages, as long as the owner was within {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} of the mirror.
* [[Scrying]] with it as though it were a ''[[crystal ball]]'' with ''[[clairaudience]]''. The user could even view into other [[plane]]s if they knew them sufficiently.
* Acting as a [[portal]] to other locations and even other planes. The destination needed to first be scryed and afterwards an invisible area remained on the "other side" that acted as a portal back. This portal would close once the owner returned, once the owner used a command word, or otherwise would close itself after a period of 24 hours.
* Once per week, the mirror could be made to accurately answer a short question regarding a creature whose image was shown upon its surface.

==History==
