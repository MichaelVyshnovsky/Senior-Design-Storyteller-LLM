A mirror of mental prowess was a type of enchanted mirror that could be found in the Realms.
A mirror of mental prowess largely resembled an ordinary mirror. On average it measured about  tall and  wide.
These mirrors had a variety of magical abilities that could be accessed by stating the proper commands. These abilities encompassed the following
* Allowing one to read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, regardless of their languages, as long as the owner was within  of the mirror.
* Scrying with it as though it were a crystal ball with clairaudience. The user could even view into other planes if they knew them sufficiently.
* Acting as a portal to other locations and even other planes. The destination needed to first be scryed and afterwards an invisible area remained on the "other side" that acted as a portal back. This portal would close once the owner returned, once the owner used a command word, or otherwise would close itself after a period of 24 hours.
* Once per week, the mirror could be made to accurately answer a short question regarding a creature whose image was shown upon its surface.
