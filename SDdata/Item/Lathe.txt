A '''lathe''' was a mechanical device used by artisans to work various materials.

==Usage==
Wood, metal, and stone could be turned on a lathe using specialized blade bits to cut the material, creating regularly shaped [[staves]], spindles, columns, rods, [[candlestick]]s, and other rounded components used for weapons, tools, furniture, and other items.{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|24,25}} Maillers used a lathe that didn't carve the material, but instead coiled [[wire]] into loops that were then cut and [[rivet]]ed, ultimately being made into [[chain mail]].

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a 20 [[gp]] lathe that could hold a {{SIAdj|2|foot|c|long=yes}} by {{SIAdj|6|inch|c|long=yes}} piece of stone or wood to be worked. They also offered woodcutting bits (5 gp) and stonecutting bits (15 gp) alongside it.
