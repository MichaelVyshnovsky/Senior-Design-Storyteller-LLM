'''Storm Ruby''' was a variety of dessert fortified [[wine]] created by [[Thamalon Uskevren]], of the noble [[Uskevren]] family of [[Selgaunt]], [[Sembia]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Storm Ruby was a sweet, tart, and full-bodied wine.

==History==
By the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, Thamalon's love for winemaking paid off. He created Storm Ruby, [[Usk Fine Old]], and [[Thamalon's Own]] wines. Storm Ruby was in production in the {{YearlinkName|1352}} or earlier. In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Thamalon Uskevren sought to trade with [[Nuldrevyn Talendar]] of [[House Talendar]], discussing a deal to ship Storm Ruby and other Uskevren wines to southern [[Amn]], [[Tethyr]], and [[Calimshan]], along with other Sembian trade goods. After tasting Storm Ruby, Nuldrevyn Talendar appreciated its excellent taste.
