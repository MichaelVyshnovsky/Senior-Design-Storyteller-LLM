The entire statue swayed and glittered.\n\nIt was displayed in a large dedicated chamber on the fourth floor of the House of the Moon. Two [[Knights of the Half Moon]] stood guard here constantly and patrols were frequent.",
        "Powers": "Legend held that the ''Moonstone Shard'' would animate to defend the temple if it came under attack. If it did, it would be a unique [[glassteeled]] [[golem]], comparable to an [[iron golem]].",
        "Reputation": "Of all the works of art in the House of the Moon, the ''Moonstone Shard'' was by far the most valuable. ''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], it was estimated to be worth no less than 100,000 [[gold piece]]s, if there was even any buyer for it."
