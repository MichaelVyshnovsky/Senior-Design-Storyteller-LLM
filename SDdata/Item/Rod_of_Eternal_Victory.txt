The '''''Rod of Eternal Victory''''' was a unique melee weapon wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Gilgeam]], the Supreme Ruler of [[Unther]].

==Description==
The ''Rod of Eternal Victory'' was a large [[footman's mace]].

==Powers==
This weapon carried a stout ''+5'' [[enchantment]] that made it much easier for Gilgeam to strike and harm an opponent. In addition to possessing all of the powers of both a ''[[rod of terror]]'' and a ''[[staff of thunder and lightning]]'', the ''Rod of Eternal Victory'' possessed three times the power of a ''[[rod of rulership]]''.
