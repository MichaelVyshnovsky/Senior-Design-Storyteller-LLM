        "mainbody": "'''''Finch's comfortable cap''''' was just one of many [[enchanted]] hats worn by the daring [[half-elven]] [[bard]] [[Finch (half-elf)|Finch]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "Despite the headwear being nowhere as well-ensorcelled as his previous hats, Finch still developed an attachment to this fanciful floppy-sided cap. It did possess a minor enchantment that slightly boosted the wearer's physical health and constitution and improved their evasion. The hat's custom enchantments made it impossible to be worn by anyone who was not a half-elven bard.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Finch wore his ''comfortable cap'' while performing in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and adventuring across the [[Sword Coast North]]."
