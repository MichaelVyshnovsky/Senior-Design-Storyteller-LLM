'''Slaker''' was the name of a dark [[beer]] brewed in [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]], a village in [[northwest Faerûn]] on the [[Long Road]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, where it was served at the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]]. At three [[copper piece]]s for a tankard, this heavy, [[barley]]-based beer was popular with the locals and visitors alike.
