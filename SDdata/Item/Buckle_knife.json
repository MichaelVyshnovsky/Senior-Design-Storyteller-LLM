        "mainbody": "Buckle knives were a variety of enchanted concealed knives with a unique hilt.\nThese knives were so named because their hilt resembled an ornament typically found on belt buckles. Because of this, buckles were also typically used like a sheath to conceal them.\nBuckle knives inflicted far more damage than a mundane knife, with enchantment bonuses ranging from +1 to +4.\n* Adele Astrolara owned a buckle knife in the mid-14 century DR. She stored it in the ruins of Castle Naerytar, in a chest alongside other magical trinkets, under the guard of a watchghost named Harold.\n* Holly Graham.\n* Ono, a master sergeant in the City Watch of Ravens Bluff in the mid-14 century DR, owned a buckle knife."
