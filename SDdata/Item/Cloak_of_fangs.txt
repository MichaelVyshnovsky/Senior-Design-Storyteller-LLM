A cloak of fangs was an enchanted item that shot darts of force.
A cloak of fangs could be used as a regular all-weather cloak for any length of time, but its magic could only be used once when the command word "Feerond" was uttered. The magic of the cloak would release a continuous spray of invisible darts of force in all directions for seven minutes that would strike and harm any target within  of the wearer. The cloak would vanish forever after the darts ceased firing.
