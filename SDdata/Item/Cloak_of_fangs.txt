A '''''cloak of fangs''''' was an enchanted item that shot darts of force.

==Powers==
A ''cloak of fangs'' could be used as a regular all-weather [[cloak]] for any length of time, but its magic could only be used once when the [[command word]] "Feerond" was uttered. The magic of the cloak would release a continuous spray of invisible darts of force in all directions for seven minutes that would strike and harm any target within {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} of the wearer. The cloak would vanish forever after the darts ceased firing.
