'''Amberfly''' was a citrus liquor distilled on the southwestern shores of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and sold throughout the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The liquor had a slightly bitter taste due to being made using rinds of small citrus fruits that resembled [[orange]]s. Amberfly was typically bottled in vessels of opaque green [[glass]].

==History==
Amberfly was popular among the wealthy of [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]], and merchants and traders on the Sword Coast, all along the [[Trade Way]], and as far north as the city of [[Luskan]].
