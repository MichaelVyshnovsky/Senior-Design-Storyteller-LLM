'''''Fireblood''''' was a powerful [[magical]] [[gem]] created by the [[Obarskyr]] dynasty. It was part of the set of magical items known as the ''[[Four from Cormyr (item set)|Four from Cormyr]]'' along with the ''[[Seal of Iron]]'', ''[[Silveredge]]'', and ''[[Deathsend]]''.

==Description==
''Fireblood'' was a brilliant blood-red [[ruby]], one-inch in diameter. It was exquisitely cut, and had a bright crimson starburst shape in its center.

==Powers==
''Fireblood'' gave its wearer complete immunity to fire, magical or mundane. It was intended to be used as part of the ''Four from Cormyr'', by being fitted into the pommel of the [[bastard sword]] ''Silveredge''.

==History==
''Fireblood'' was the property of the Obarskyr family, and was traditionally held by them. ''Fireblood'' had been lost inside the ruins of [[Orvaskyte Keep]], but was recovered by adventurers in [[1369 DR]] who then reassembled it with the ''Four from Cormyr''.
