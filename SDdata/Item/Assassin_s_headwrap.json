        "mainbody": "Assassins headwrap was a unique enchanted thiefs cowl from the city of Athkatla in Amn, created before the late 15 century DR.\nAssassins headwrap dramatically increased the wearers ability to stealth and avoid detection. Additionally, its magic concealed the wearer after a successful killing strike.\nAssassins headwrap, originally part of a set of light armor, was commissioned by an unnamed Merchant Prince of Amn for his daughter, who sought to become an infamous assassin after dreaming about it. Unbeknownst to her father, the daughter began training to become an assassin with her fathers less-than-savory contacts in Amns criminal underbelly. Despite the daughters fears, her Merchant Prince father, did not disavow her upon finding out. Instead, he commissioned the creation of assassins headwrap and the rest of the stealth-enhancing magic armor for her.\nSometime later, by the late 15 century DR, assassins headwrap was damaged and ripped apart. It could have been repaired by a master smith form Luskan, using a scarf and cloth of a hood, found in the Underdark in the Savage Frontier."
