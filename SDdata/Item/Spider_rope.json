        "mainbody": "Spider ropes were a variety of enchanted ropes\nThese stout ropes were mundane in appearance and in their unactivated state measured no more than  in length.\nTwice per day, a spider rope could be verbally commanded by a wielder to increase its length and attach itself to an inanimate object. Spider ropes could increase their length to up to  and would remain at that length indefinitely until their owner commanded them to return to their original length.\nSpider ropes attached themselves to inanimate objects, no more than two, by tying their ends around the targeted object(s). If one were to ever tie a spider rope around something manually though, the rope would swiftly untie itself.\nIf enough damage were inflicted upon a spider rope it would disintegrate into a fine, gray powder that lacked magical properties.\nMost guilds in the Dalelands possessed one or more spider ropes."
