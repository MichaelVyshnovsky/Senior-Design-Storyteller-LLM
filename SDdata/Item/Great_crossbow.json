        "mainbody": "The '''great crossbow''' was a unique variety of [[siege engine]] developed by the [[gnome]] inventor [[Nadul DaRoni]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Most sieges are easy to begin and hard to end. I thought to myself: What siege weapon could break a fortress? What siege weapon could break down a castle door? or fell a tower? or smash a wall to rubble? And I thought: what heavy thing could impact to do this? A boulder? a small brick building? a family of [[giant]]s? These things are thrown easily by a great [[catapult]], but arc too highly and tumble too oddly to be accurate. I thought: perhaps a tree, if shot like a [[bolt|quarrel]], would do such damage.|Nadul DaRoni musing on the thought process that led to him developing the great crossbow.}}",
        "Description": "As its name implied, the great crossbow looked like a [[crossbow]] but massively scaled up, with three wheels mounted along each side of its base. Moving and aiming the weapon required a team of four [[demihuman]]s and [[horse]]s, while loading it required a team of eight demihumans and four horses.\n\nThe great crossbow was designed particularly with trees in mind, having them emulate the quarrels used in crossbows, though earth or stone could also be used as ammunition. The largest size of straight trunk the weapon could hold was {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} wide. DaRoni recommended [[pine]] trees stripped of their branches as the most ideal option and suggested that covering the weapon in dry pine needles made for a much slicker launch.\n\nIn tests conducted by DaRoni, it was observed that the great crossbow was capable of smashing solid towers and razing walls that were {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} thick.",
        "History": "The great crossbow was originally made for King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] of [[Cormyr]], but never saw use during his reign. The catalogue listed the great crossbow for a price of 1250 [[gold piece]]s, though Aurora noted that all of the listed prices for DaRoni's inventions were only rough estimates of what he would actually charge."
