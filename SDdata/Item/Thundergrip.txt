'''''Thundergrip''''', or '''''Thundergrip gauntlets''''', were a pair of [[enchanted]] gloves from the ruins of the City of Song, [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Thundergrip'' were gloves decorated with [[iron]] [[rivet]]s.

==Powers==
These magic gloves caused the wearer to deal greater damage through hand-to-hand combat or when wielding metallic weapons, similarly to weapons with a ''+2'' enchantment. Additionally, they allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[shocking grasp]]'' spell at will. These gloves held at least four charges of the spell.

==History==
The origins of these enchanted gloves were shrouded in mystery. However, one thing was knownâ€”they originated from the ruins of the elven city of Myth Drannor. By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the gloves were found by a clan of [[ormyrr]], who, like many of their kin, were obsessed with collecting items of magical power. The gloves' owner was [[Samaj]] of the [[Sharpstick clan]], who dwelled in the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] of the ruined city. Samaj was willing to trade his magic items with peaceful adventurers were they to find themselves in the dangerous ruins.
