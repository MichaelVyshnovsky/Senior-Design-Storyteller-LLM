The '''''Perfect Fang of Lolth''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[scythe]], part of a set alongside the ''[[Perfect Charm of Lolth]]'', forged deep in the [[Demonweb Pits]], the [[Abyss]]al layer ruled by [[Lolth]], The Demon Queen of Spiders.

==Description==
The ''Perfect Fang'' was an ornate [[weapon]], carved with ancient magical runes of the Demonweb Pits.

==Powers==
This powerful [[Lolthite]] scythe was built to rip into the souls of the enemies of the Spider Queen. The weapon's powers increased when it was wielded alongside the ''Perfect Charm of Lolth''. In addition to dramatically increased damage health by the scythe, it healed the wielder with each successful slash. The ''Perfect Fang'' also magically shielded its wielder from incoming damage when their stamina was exhausted during battle. Lastly, at the beginning of each battle, the scythe increased the wielder's chance of dealing increased damage with a lucky or well-aimed attack.

The weapon's magic made it usable by [[barbarian]]s only.

==History==
The ''Perfect Fang of Lolth'' and the ''Perfect Charm of Lolth'' were forged in eons past deep in the Demonweb Pits. The weapons found their way to the [[Prime Material plane]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], possibly ending up in the hands of drow and adventurers of the [[Northdark]] who challenged the [[beholder]] [[deity]] [[Gzemnid]], or barbarians who survived a descent into the Demonweb Pits and a battle with Lolth herself.
