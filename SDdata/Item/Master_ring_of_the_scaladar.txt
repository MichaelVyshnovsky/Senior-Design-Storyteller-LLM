The master ring of the scaladar was a unique magic item that could command any scaladar.
The ring was made from iron and was quite plain.
Any commands issued by the wearer of the ring would take precedence over other commands a scaladar was following at the time.
The master ring of the scaladar was created and worn by Trobriand.
