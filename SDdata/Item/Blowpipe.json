        "Ammunition": "A wide variety of ammunition were known to be used in blowpipes. This included blowgun [[Dart|darts]], needles, and little pellets of hardened clay. Darts were the most commonly used form of ammunition, while needles were used to deliver [[poison]] and pellets were used in hunting small game.\n\nBlowgun darts were small arrows, with cotton or some other form of plant fiber used as fletching. This fletching made an efficient seal in the pipe, allowing for a greater build up of pressure from the wielder's breath.\n\nBlowgun needles were typically {{SI|2|in|long=yes}} in length and made of [[iron]]. They were known to be sold in groups of twenty in small wooden cases. Poisons typically used with these needles included [[greenblood oil]], [[bloodroot]], [[blue whinnis]], [[shadow essence]], and [[deathblade]].",
