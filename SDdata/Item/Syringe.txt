'''Syringes''', also known as '''deeptongue tubes''' or '''draw tubes''', were a type of medical tool used by [[alchemist]]s, [[cleric]]al healers, and lay healers in the Realms to extract or inject substances into bodies. They were comparatively less popular than compresses and [[poultice]]s.{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-06-03 - Syringes in the Realms}}

==Description==
[[File:Syringe ViktraMordenheim.png|thumb|273px|''Doctor [[w:c:ravenloft:Viktra Mordenheim|Viktra Mordenheim]] extracts some blood using a syringe.'']]
A syringe consisted of a hollow tube, a plunger, and a sharp needle end for stabbing into bodies. Though early syringes could only extract substances, not inject them. They could be made from a variety of materials, such as [[bamboo]] cut at an angle and broom straw or dried reed as a plunger, or a combination of [[glass]] and metal, such as [[bronze]].

Syringes were typically used to extract gases, [[poison]]s, or pus from the body. They could also be used for bloodletting or to reduce swelling.

==History==
The exact origins of syringes on [[Toril]] were shrouded in mystery. In the ancient past many different races came about inventing them independently from one another, but these distinct instances became lost to history.

==Notable Syringes==
* The ''[[intellect syringe]]'', a magical syringe that was said to have come to [[Toril]] from another [[plane]] or [[demiplane]] sometime before the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/252/Legacy of Decay|38}}

==Notable Users==
* In the [[Domains of Dread|Domain of Dread]] known as [[Aggarath]], a group known as the "enforcers", reflections of the guards that [[Castle Spulzeer]] had on the [[Prime Material plane]],<ref> carried syringes on their person. These contained a green chemical that would transform those injected with it into something resembling a [[yuan-ti]], gradually over the course of 1 to 4 weeks.<ref>
* [[Malus Thorm]] and the rest of the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]]'s staff were all outfitted with ''+1 syringes''.<ref>
* [[Xopal]], a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] that worked in the venom distillery of the [[Fane of the Night Serpent]], carried a bronze ''+3 syringe''.
