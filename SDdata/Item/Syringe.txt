Syringes, also known as deeptongue tubes or draw tubes, were a type of medical tool used by alchemists, clerical healers, and lay healers in the Realms to extract or inject substances into bodies. They were comparatively less popular than compresses and poultices.

A syringe consisted of a hollow tube, a plunger, and a sharp needle end for stabbing into bodies. Though early syringes could only extract substances, not inject them. They could be made from a variety of materials, such as bamboo cut at an angle and broom straw or dried reed as a plunger, or a combination of glass and metal, such as bronze.
Syringes were typically used to extract gases, poisons, or pus from the body. They could also be used for bloodletting or to reduce swelling.
The exact origins of syringes on Toril were shrouded in mystery. In the ancient past many different races came about inventing them independently from one another, but these distinct instances became lost to history.
* The intellect syringe, a magical syringe that was said to have come to Toril from another plane or demiplane sometime before the midâ€“14 century DR.
* In the Domain of Dread known as Aggarath, a group known as the "enforcers", reflections of the guards that Castle Spulzeer had on the Prime Material plane, carried syringes on their person. These contained a green chemical that would transform those injected with it into something resembling a yuan-ti, gradually over the course of 1 to 4 weeks.
* Malus Thorm and the rest of the House of Healings staff were all outfitted with +1 syringes.
* Xopal, a yuan-ti pureblood that worked in the venom distillery of the Fane of the Night Serpent, carried a bronze +3 syringe.
