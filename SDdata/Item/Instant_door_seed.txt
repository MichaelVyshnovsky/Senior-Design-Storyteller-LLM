Instant door seeds were mundane seeds, enchanted to conjure forth an escape route to their owner.
Each seed contained a single charge of the dimension door spell. To activate an instant door seed, the owner had to throw a seed against a hard surface. When activated, a seed opened a dimension door, invisible to all but the seeds owner and one other creature chosen by them. The two-way gate could transport the seeds owner and one creature of their choice away from their current whereabouts. Usually, instant door seeds were sold in padded bags from three to thirty seeds per bag.
Instant door seeds were one of the many magical creations of Elminster Aumar, the Sage of Shadowdale, when he was a mere youth, a fledgling mage. He was captured by a bandit band and imprisoned in a castles dungeon. He escaped thanks to coming up with the idea of enchanting a handful of seeds with the dimension door spell earlier.
