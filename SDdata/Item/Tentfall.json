        "Description": "In addition to the [[heartland flier]], [[air screw]], and [[doubles wheel]], DaRoni put some effort into a device that would allow a common person to fall safely from a great height. According to his claims, any person with enough [[canvas]] could make it, in the form of a {{SI|12|yard|long=yes}} square and {{SI|12|yard}} tall pyramidal [[tent]]-like shape.This size doesn't seem to match the diagrams of the device, which would depict 12 ''feet'' instead. The tricky part was apparently holding onto the large ring that hung from beneath the tentfall as it drifted downwards.",
        "Availability": "''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' listed the design by Nadul DaRoni, though it seemed to be a non-saleable item, instead intended to instruct others in the creation of their own tentfalls."
