        "mainbody": "The '''''dagger of chaos''''' was a magic blade carrying a strange curse that transformed the wielder into many different forms and sometimes itself.",
        "History": "In the time of [[Netheril]], the ''dagger of chaos'' was given to [[Serreg]] of [[Neverwinter]] by the god of war, [[Targus]]. Serreg was an archwizard serving Lady [[Polaris]] of [[Delia]] and investigating a mysterious blight on the land. In {{YearlinkName|-462}}, he discovered it was the work of the [[phaerimm]], and fled for his life. Praying to Targus for aid, he received the ''dagger of chaos''. Polymorphing through several forms, Serreg slew the pursuing phaerimm. However, his final form was a mighty [[dragon]] and he now cared nothing for mortal matters. Preferring his new form, he tore the dagger—now manifested as a claw—from his hand, and used it as the beginning of his treasure hoard.\n\nOver time, the magic of the blade decayed—rather than transform the wielder, it transformed itself from time to time. By the 1370s [[DR]], it took the form of a [[greatsword]], and was likely to stay this way for years. It surfaced in the [[North]] and in [[1372 DR]] was being sold from [[Colmarr's Shop]] in [[Luskan]].",
        "Powers": {
            "Original": "It originally functioned as a ''+5 [[dagger]]'', but when the wielder struck an enemy and harmed them, the wielder was instantly ''[[polymorph other|polymorphed]]'' into a new form. The form was random, and could be of any creature, humanoid or monstrous. This form lasted until they again attacked and hurt another, at which point they changed again.\n\nIf one of the monstrous forms did not or could not wield a weapon, then the dagger was transformed into its primary means of attack, such as a single fang or claw, which took on a silvery hue.\n\nDiscarding the dagger did not return the wielder to his or her original shape.",
            "Decayed": "In its decayed form around 1372 DR, the ''dagger of chaos'' appeared as a ''+2 [[greatsword]]''. A foe struck by it could be briefly [[confusion|confused]], and the injuries it inflicted healed the wielder."
        },
        "Description": "As a dagger, it was of exquisite workmanship and was decorated with abstract patterns and inlays.\n\nAs a greatsword, it had a curved blade and a heavily branching hilt, though the hilt later became crescent-shaped.",
        "Creation": "Creation of a ''dagger of chaos'' entailed the ''[[polymorph other]]'' spell. Cursed but powerful, it was worth in excess of 100,000 [[gold piece]]s."
