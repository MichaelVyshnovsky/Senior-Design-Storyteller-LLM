Spice, also known as deg in Dwarvish, was a broad term for a variety of seeds, roots, and bark that were primarily used for seasoning or flavoring food. They were often dried, ground up into a powder, and mixed together with a variety of other spices. Over time the advancement of long distance trade caused spices that were once exclusive to a single region to be spread far and wide across Toril.
Travelers on Toril typically kept spices in little glass vials, encased in whittled wooden shielding shells to guard against breakage. These were carried inside of drawstring leather pouches, known as spice pouches. Such pouches had the "finished" side as their interior, thus minimizing reactions with the vials contents.
