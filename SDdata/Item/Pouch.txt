A '''pouch''' was a container used for carrying small items, such as [[coin]]s, on one's person. They were commonly used as [[adventurer|adventuring]] gear. and pouches were also how children's [[marbles]] were typically stored.

==Description==
Most pouches were made of [[leather]] and weighed about {{SI|0.5|lb|long=yes}}. Those made for small folk, such as [[gnome]]s or [[halfling]]s, were about a fourth the size and weighed around {{SI|0.125|lb|long=yes}}. Most could strap to one's belt. They sold in most markets for around 1 [[gold piece]] but could be found in [[Aurora's Emporium]] for only 2 [[silver piece]]s. Merchants selling sling bullets usually included a complimentary pouch with the bullets.

; ''[[Bottomless pouch]]'' : This pouch contained an [[extradimensional space]], allowing it to store more than it should have been able to physically.
; Dahlver-Nar Pouch: A leather pouch decorated with stitched images of various heroes and lightly fanciful creatures was typically used to carry the ''[[Teeth of Dahlver-Nar]]''.

; Gnomish workman's pouch: Sets of [[Gnomish workman's leather]] were built with 56 pouches that functioned similarly to a ''bottomless pouch'' or ''pouch of accessibility''. Only sixteen of these pouches were visible, with five of them having nine additional pouches sewn into their interior and each of those fifty could hold up to {{SIAdj|1|cu. ft}} of material weighing up to {{SI|10|lb|k}}. Five of the unconnected pouches could only hold up to {{SI|9|cu. ft|long=yes}} of material weighing up to {{SI|30|lb|k}}. And one larger pouch was designed to hold a [[familiar]], regardless of its size, along with any food or water they might need. All of the pouches responded to their wearer's thoughts, always having on top whatever specific item was desired by them when they reached in.<ref>{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Nadul DaRoni}}
