        "mainbody": "harp of healing was a variety of harp imbued with restorative magic.\nThis harp would gradually heal any wounded creature within  of it when played. This could be done for eight consecutive hours before a bard began to seriously risk misplaying it.\nIf the playing of the harp ceased for whatever reason, it would not continue healing affected creatures until they became wounded again.\n* Brond Carlow, a bard in Ravens Bluff, owned one of these harps."
