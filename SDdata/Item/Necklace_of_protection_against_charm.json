        "mainbody": "necklace of protection against charm was an enchanted piece of jewelry that shielded the wearer from charm magic.\nThis necklace was made from gold and hung down to the chest. It was studded with various gemstones.\nWearing this necklace made it much easier for the wearer to resist the effects of any charm magic. Furthermore, focusing on the gems of the necklace would reveal the location of the spellcaster who attempted the use of charm magic upon the wearer.\nThese magic necklaces were traditionally worn by Precepts of Mulhorand."
