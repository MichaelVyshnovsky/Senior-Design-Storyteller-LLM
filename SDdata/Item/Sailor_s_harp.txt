'''''Sailor's harps''''' were old decaying [[harp]]s that were [[enchanted]] to become a debilitating magical weapon.

==Powers==
''Sailor's harps'' were so old they crumbled after a single-use. However, that was by design. These decaying musical instruments were enchanted to unleash a deafening burst of cacophonous raucous when in the hands of a bard. After that, ''sailor's harps'' fell apart and turned into dust.

==History==
These harps were popular among sailors and pirates who had musical or [[bard]]ic inclinations. By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, ''sailor's harps'' could be found in the hands and sold by sailors visiting [[Neverwinter]] and pirates of the [[Nelanther Islands]].
