        "mainbody": "raellen, so-named after the Aglarondan for Three Hearts, was an artifact of the faithful of Silvanus.\nEraellen was a latticework of wood, concealing three small pieces of petrified sap. Each piece of sap belonged to a different tree oak, ash and thorn.\nChereth had called on Eraellen to resurrect Kheil as Berun. In his final confrontation with Chereth, Berun used Eraellen to heighten his senses and to protect himself against Chereths magic. In turn, Chereth was able to use the artifact to shield himself from a stream of flames conjured through a planar portal.\nChereth intended to use the artifact in a rite to induce a supervolcanic eruption in Sentinelspire, prompting mass die-offs of crops and thus civilization across Faerun Talieth believed that the artifact could also be used in reverse to prevent such an eruption from ever coming to pass.\nChereth had originally acquired Eraellen from the Fortress of the Old Man around , while he was there as a guest he fled with the artifact, prompting Alaodin, the Old Man of the Mountain, to send assassins after him. He bestowed Eraellen upon Berun before returning for the Fortress of the Old Man around . Chereth later sought it out as the Old Man of the Mountain in , prompting Talieth and Sauk to go after Berun to acquire it before the Old Man did. The Eraellen was finally taken by Sauk and Talieth to a scry-proofed room in Sentinelspire by Tarsakh 17, where Lewan attempted to unlock its powers without success.\nOn the night of Tarsakh 25, , the Old Man of the Mountain finally tried to take Eraellen from Lewan by force after being rebuffed, but a recently arrived Berun thwarted him and then fought him to a standstill using the artifact. Chereth eventually prevailed, but it was past the window of opportunity for his ritual to succeed."
