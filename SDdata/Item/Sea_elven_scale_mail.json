        "mainbody": "'''Sea elven scale mail''' was a rare and expensive variety of [[scale armor]] that was created by the [[sea elves]] of [[Faer√ªn]], adapting surface scale mail to the peculiarities of sea elven design.",
        "Description": "This armor was as resilient as the average surface scale mail. However, it was made of metals that didn't rust and its scales were affixed to a backing of [[eel]]-skin. Unlike regular leather, this material wouldn't disintegrate in salt water.\n\nIt was also unique among other scale mails for its beautiful silver coating, the material of which was a matter of debate among surface armorers. Often speculating it may be [[platinum]], [[silver]], or even [[mithral]].",
        "Reputation": "Out of all the [[demihuman]] manufactured scale mails in the Realms, this was the most intricately constructed. And it was generally considered to be nearly as valuable as [[elven chain mail]].",
        "Notable Wearers": "* This armor was generally owned only by the noble elite of sea elven society, who wore it during great ceremonies or times of war.\n* A few clergymen in the [[Church of Deep Sashelas]] wore this armor."
