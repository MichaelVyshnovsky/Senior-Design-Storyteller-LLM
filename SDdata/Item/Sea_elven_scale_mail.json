        "mainbody": "Sea elven scale mail was a rare and expensive variety of scale armor that was created by the sea elves of Faer√ªn, adapting surface scale mail to the peculiarities of sea elven design.\nThis armor was as resilient as the average surface scale mail. However, it was made of metals that didnt rust and its scales were affixed to a backing of eel-skin. Unlike regular leather, this material wouldnt disintegrate in salt water.\nIt was also unique among other scale mails for its beautiful silver coating, the material of which was a matter of debate among surface armorers. Often speculating it may be platinum, silver, or even mithral.\nOut of all the demihuman manufactured scale mails in the Realms, this was the most intricately constructed. And it was generally considered to be nearly as valuable as elven chain mail.\n* This armor was generally owned only by the noble elite of sea elven society, who wore it during great ceremonies or times of war.\n* A few clergymen in the Church of Deep Sashelas wore this armor."
