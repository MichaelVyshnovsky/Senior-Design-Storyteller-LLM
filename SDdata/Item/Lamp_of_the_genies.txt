A '''''lamp of the genies''''' was perhaps the most common form of ''[[genie prison]]''.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|748|Lamp of the genies}}

==Uses==
As with all ''genie prisons'', the ''lamp of the genies'' was used to snare a [[genie]] and force it into servitude. The maker of the lamp dictated the exact conditions that needed to be met for a genie to be freed once captured. These lamps could be used to trap [[dao]], [[efreet]], [[marid]]s, and [[djinn]].

Though used more often by [[human]]s and [[humanoid]]s, these items were sometimes used by genies to punish their kin.
