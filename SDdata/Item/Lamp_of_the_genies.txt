A lamp of the genies was perhaps the most common form of genie prison.
As with all genie prisons, the lamp of the genies was used to snare a genie and force it into servitude. The maker of the lamp dictated the exact conditions that needed to be met for a genie to be freed once captured. These lamps could be used to trap dao, efreet, marids, and djinn.
Though used more often by humans and humanoids, these items were sometimes used by genies to punish their kin.
