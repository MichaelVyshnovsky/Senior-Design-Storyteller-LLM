A belt of priestly might and warding was a magical defensive item, created by servants of deities in Faer√ªn.
These belts granted the same boons as a belt of priestly might as well as the ability to create a magic circle against evil or against good once per day that lasted for 80 minutes.
Like the belt of priestly might, this item was first created after the Time of Troubles.
To create a belt of priestly might and warding, the spells barkskin, bulls strength, and magic circle against good/evil were cast.
