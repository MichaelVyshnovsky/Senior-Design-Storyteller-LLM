'''''Way-marker runes''''' were one of the three types of ''[[drow rune]]s'', the other two being ''[[house defense glyph]]s'' and ''[[sacred glyph]]s''.

==Description==
[[Drow]] [[rune magic|runes]] were always limned in black, be it with [[ink]], paste, or inlay. The runes were elegant. 

They were used in places where the drow patrolled but did not live and were found in side-caverns, alcoves, and other places where said patrols could rest use as a defensive spot against monsters.

==Powers==
Unlike other ''drow runes'', ''way-marker runes'' were safe for all drow but harmful to all who were not of the drow race. Their power remained intact for years, the exact length depended on the creator's skill.

These runes had only one power with the following eight being the most common. However, drow [[runecaster]]s were known to create special ones for chosen locations.

==History==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the technology to create ''way-marker runes'' was already old.

The secret of how to crate ''way-marker runes'' was one of the best-kept ones and was not common knowledge outsider of chosen members of the clergies or noble households.
