'''''Commander's rings''''' were magical [[ring]]s made by the [[War Wizards]] of [[Cormyr]] for the kingdom's military commanders around [[1372 DR]].

==Powers==
They helped the wearer resist deleterious effects and deflect attacks against them.

Three times a day each, the ring could produce the effects of ''[[daylight]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[knock]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]'', but only when the correct [[command word]] was uttered.

If a ''[[Purple Dragon ring]]'' was worn on the same hand as this ring, they were treated as one ring, thus allowing a third ring on the other hand. The wearer was also able to sense the distance and direction of any ''Purple Dragon rings'' within 100 feet (30 meters), but this power of detection was blocked by sufficient thicknesses of stone, metal, wood, or other solid boundaries.

==Creation==
Creation of a ''commander's ring'' required the spells it could cast above, as well as ''[[locate object]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Royal Magician [[Ganrahast Aeiulvana]], Lord Warder [[Vainrence]], former Royal Magician [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], and [[Storm Silverhand]] found a way to enchant the rings to safely allow telepathic communication through the ''team'' and ''commander's rings'', a feat previously impossible because of the aftereffects of the [[Spellplague]].{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|2763}}
