        "mainbody": "Fencers Grace were sets of light enchanted armor especially favored by duelists and brigands of the Sword Coast.\nThese sets of armor were especially designed for agile and fast fighters, such as duelists, as well as sailors and pirates who often tumbled on board their ships at sea.\nFencers Grace was enhanced with a +1 enchantment as well as improved the wearers abilities of effectively parrying attacks and tumbling out of harms way. Additionally, it allowed the wearer to cast the cats grace spell twice a day.\nThe most notable incident that involved a set of Fencers Grace was when Lord Tygarian used it to pay a ransom to a notorious pirate, Baralen the Black, who kidnapped the noblemans daughter. However, the pirate did not return Tygarians daughter after receiving this enchanted armor. When the woman found out, she flew into a fit of rage and struck Baralen the Black dead with a single blow and claimed Fencers Grace. Later, she used that set of armor to start her own fruitful piratical career.\nIn 1372 DR, one of these armors belonged to captain Herab of the Zhentarim-allied smuggling frigate Barracuda."
