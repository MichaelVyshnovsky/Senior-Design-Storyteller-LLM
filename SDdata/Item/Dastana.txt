A '''dastana''' was a type of arm-guard

==Description==
A set of dastanas consisted of a pair of hinged plates that fully encircled the user's arm. They were typically accompanied by [[mitten]]s made of either cloth or mail.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], artisans in [[Port Nyanzaru]] created a number of high quality dastanas for use by [[guardian fighter]]s.
