A dastana was a type of arm-guard
A set of dastanas consisted of a pair of hinged plates that fully encircled the users arm. They were typically accompanied by mittens made of either cloth or mail.
In the late 15 century DR, artisans in Port Nyanzaru created a number of high quality dastanas for use by guardian fighters.
