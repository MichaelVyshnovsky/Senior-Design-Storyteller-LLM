'''''Theodore's gloves of kinship''''' were [[enchanted]] [[gauntlets]] from the ancient [[elf|elven]] city of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Theodore's gloves of kinship'' were masterfully-sewn [[leather]] gauntlets.

==History==
The ''gloves of kinship'' belonged to Theodore of the Myth Drannor, predating the city's fall in the [[Weeping War]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Theodore's gloves of kinship'' were hidden within the deeper levels of the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The gloves were locked in a room that survived centuries undisturbed. Along with the ''gloves of kinship'', the room held several ''[[healing potion]]s'' as well as a set of keys to the lower chambers of the ancient elven dungeon.
