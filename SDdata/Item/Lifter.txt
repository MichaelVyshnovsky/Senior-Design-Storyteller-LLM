A '''''lifter''''' was a magical transportation device used by [[beholder]]s to move people and cargo.

==Description==
The ''lifter'' was a large disk-shaped platform up to {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} across, enchanted with a basic autonomous ''[[levitation]]'' effect. They were often heavily decorated with ornamental inlays and [[enamel]]ed designs of popular beholder artistic subjects, such as beholder eyeballs.

==Powers==
A ''lifter'' would float in place by default and could be programmed with a pre-set weight limit, whereupon it would begin gradually changing altitude. It would stop when a rider spoke the [[command word]], or it came within {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} of a ceiling. ''Lifters'' were often placed in vertical tunnels that were only a few inches wider than the disk, in order to be used as elevators.
