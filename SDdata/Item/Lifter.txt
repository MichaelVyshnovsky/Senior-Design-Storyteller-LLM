A lifter was a magical transportation device used by beholders to move people and cargo.
The lifter was a large disk-shaped platform up to  across, enchanted with a basic autonomous levitation effect. They were often heavily decorated with ornamental inlays and enameled designs of popular beholder artistic subjects, such as beholder eyeballs.
A lifter would float in place by default and could be programmed with a pre-set weight limit, whereupon it would begin gradually changing altitude. It would stop when a rider spoke the command word, or it came within  of a ceiling. Lifters were often placed in vertical tunnels that were only a few inches wider than the disk, in order to be used as elevators.
