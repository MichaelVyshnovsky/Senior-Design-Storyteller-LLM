A dragon slayer sword was an enchanted sword that was more deadly when used against dragons.
These swords were more capable of piercing the flesh of, and causing more harm to, true dragons. Furthermore, each of these swords was designed to specifically harm a specific color of dragon, inflicting much more pain upon that type.
