A '''''dragon slayer sword''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[sword]] that was more deadly when used against [[dragon]]s.

==Powers==
These swords were more capable of piercing the flesh of, and causing more harm to, true dragons. Furthermore, each of these swords was designed to specifically harm a specific color of dragon, inflicting much more pain upon that type.
