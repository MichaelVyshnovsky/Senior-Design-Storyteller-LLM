An orb of radiance was a magic item that helped defend against attacks from drow.
These orbs were the size of a hand and made from quartz.
Orbs of radiance were prized by drow wizards for their ability to defend from other drow attacks. While contact with the wielders skin is made, the wearer could utter command words to unleash the following powers of the orb sunray four times per day, light lasting for one day, ruby ray of reversal once per day. Using any of the ruby rays powers slightly harmed the wielder.
Ildibane Nasadra, the archmage of Ched Nasad, carried an orb of radiance.
The creation of these rare items was believed to with the help of surface-dwelling clerics.
