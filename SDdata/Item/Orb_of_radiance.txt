An '''''orb of radiance''''' was a magic item that helped defend against attacks from [[drow]].

==Description==
These orbs were the size of a hand and made from [[quartz]].

==Powers==
''Orbs of radiance'' were prized by drow [[wizard]]s for their ability to defend from other drow attacks. While contact with the wielder's skin is made, the wearer could utter command words to unleash the following powers of the orb: ''[[sunray]]'' four times per day, ''[[light]]'' lasting for one day, ''[[ruby ray of reversal]]'' once per day. Using any of the ''ruby ray's'' powers slightly harmed the wielder.

==Notable Owners==
[[Ildibane Nasadra]], the [[archmage]] of [[Ched Nasad]], carried an ''orb of radiance''.

==History==
The creation of these rare items was believed to with the help of surface-dwelling [[cleric]]s.
