        "mainbody": "'''''Springstep boots''''' were [[enchanted]] [[boot]]s that boosted the wearer's movement in battle.",
        "Description": "These elegant and nimble [[leather]] books had a bounce and spring back with each step of the wearer.",
        "Powers": "''Springstep boots'' possessed a minor enchantment that slightly boosted the wearer's movement speed every time they dashed in combat. The boosting effects ended if the wearer was restrained, ''[[entangle]]d'', or hindered by similar means.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''springstep boots'' was stored in the treasure room within the ruined [[Shattered Sanctum]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]]. Presumably, the boots were among treasures collected in the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s raids on nearby communities."
