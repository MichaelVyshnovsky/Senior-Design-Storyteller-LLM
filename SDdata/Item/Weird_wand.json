        "mainbody": "A '''weird wand''' was a magical [[wand]] used in the [[Utter East]] during the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).\n\nIt was a golden-hued scepter with a claw-like top studded with red-brown stones. In it was mounted a chunk of [[obsidian]].\n\nFor a small expenditure of [[mana]], it could create a '''weird ward''', a large and indestructible black disc that repelled all creatures and blocked passage through its area. The weird ward came into being at a chosen, unobstructed location and it hovered a short distance above the ground. It could not be moved, but creating a new weird ward would destroy the previous one."
