        "mainbody": "A weird wand was a magical wand used in the Utter East during the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).\nIt was a golden-hued scepter with a claw-like top studded with red-brown stones. In it was mounted a chunk of obsidian.\nFor a small expenditure of mana, it could create a weird ward, a large and indestructible black disc that repelled all creatures and blocked passage through its area. The weird ward came into being at a chosen, unobstructed location and it hovered a short distance above the ground. It could not be moved, but creating a new weird ward would destroy the previous one."
