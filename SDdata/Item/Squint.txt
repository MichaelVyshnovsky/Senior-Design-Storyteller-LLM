'''''Squint''''' was an enchanted [[spyglass]] found in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Squint'' was a small collapsible tube with carved [[gem]] [[lenses]]. It was bound in [[gold]]en metal and wrapped in a bright purple ribbon, forming a trellis pattern.

==Powers==
Apart from the ingenuity of lenses allowing the user to see distant objects up close, ''Squint'' possessed an enchantment that allowed the viewer to place the ''[[eyebite]]'' spell on the target as well as disarm them for a brief time.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Calliope]], a [[bard]] adventurer, owned ''Squint'' during her time working with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. She always mentioned that when she looked through the gadget, she felt like an giant angry one-eyed idol from some far off temple.
