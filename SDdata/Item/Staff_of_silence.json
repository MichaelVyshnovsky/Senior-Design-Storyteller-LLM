        "mainbody": "he staff of silence was a magical staff that completely negated any noise made by its bearer.\nIn addition to negating all sound made by the bearer, a staff of silence could imbue the bearer with deafness, effectively making them immune to any form of sound-based attack to include any power word spells.\nThe bearer could release the stored sonic energy of the staff in a focused attack once per day, causing a high-pitched shriek that caused physical harm and deafened and stunned any targets nearby.\nThe staff of silence originated in Myth Drannor."
