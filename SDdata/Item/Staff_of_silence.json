        "Powers": "In addition to negating all sound made by the bearer, a ''staff of silence'' could imbue the bearer with deafness, effectively making them immune to any form of sound-based attack to include any ''[[Power word, banishment|power word]]'' [[spell]]s.\n\nThe bearer could release the stored sonic energy of the staff in a focused attack once per day, causing a high-pitched shriek that caused physical harm and deafened and stunned any targets nearby.",
        "History": "The ''staff of silence'' originated in [[Myth Drannor]]."
