Old Pappa Floonbats Patent Medicinal Hair Restorer was a common magical ointment, patented in the Blade Kingdoms by its inventor, Old Pappa Floonbat sometime before 1217 DR.
Each bottle of the patent medicine came with instructions written on its label. The bottle was to be shaken vigorously, then generously splashed onto bald spots and gently massaged in.
Old Pappa Floonbats Patent Medicinal Hair Restorer likely did not work on feathers, and most definitely did not grow back tailfeathers on an embarrassingly plucked firebirds backside.
