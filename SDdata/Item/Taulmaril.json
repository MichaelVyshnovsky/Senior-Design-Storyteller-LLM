        "History": "Originally the [[longbow]] was a gift from Lady [[Anariel]], Sister of [[Faer√ªn]], to [[Clan Battlehammer]], but in [[1356 DR]], the [[Companions of the Hall]] entered the ruins of the Hall of [[Dumathoin]] in [[Mithril Hall]] and [[Regis]] found the bow hidden in a gap in the stone wall. Later, Catti-brie gave Taulmaril to [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] after she was injured in [[1370 DR]]. He kept the bow in his possession even after Catti-brie's rebirth, since she was no longer in practice and generally used her new proficiency in [[magic]]."
