'''Garlraw''' was a strong, alcoholic [[dwarven]] beverage available in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], particularly the dwarf-owned tavern known as [[Phlambror's]]. Few non-dwarves could tolerate this rich, potent drink.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|75}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 58: Khôltar, Part 9, Tarrying Nigh Handrornlar}}

==Description==
Garlraw was made by mixing different varieties of [[ale]], [[whiskey]], and sweet syrup together, adding [[butter]], and simmering over low heat to thicken it and enhance the flavor.
