'''''Chimes of hunger''''' were a [[cursed]] variety of [[chime of opening|''chimes of opening'']].

==Description==
The [[chime]]s were identical in appearance to ''chimes of opening''.

==Powers==
For their first several uses, ''chimes of hunger'' would give an effect similar to that of a ''chime of opening''. But eventually, their cursed effect would kick in. When struck all creatures within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the wielder were immediately struck with ravenous hunger. Those affected would drop everything they were holding and doing and instead tear into whatever food they had on hand or nearby. After eating, there was a chance the effect would wear off on a creature. However, those affected that were without access to food would rush towards where the ''chime of hunger'' was sounded and attack any creatures there, striving to kill and eat them.

When played in the hands of a proper [[bard]], the effective radius of ''chimes of hunger'' increased in relation to the skillful of the bard, raising in increments of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.<ref>
