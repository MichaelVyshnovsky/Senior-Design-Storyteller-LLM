        "mainbody": "ring of dragons was a magic ring that, as the name suggested, bestowed dragon-related powers. They were highly coveted, and used by the Cult of the Dragon, particularly within their leadership. By 1372 DR, 70 or so rings had been crafted.\nEach ring was worth around 25,000 gold pieces.\nIt was a brass ring that resembled a dragon or serpent biting its own tail.\nThe wearer could communicate verbally (such as by tongues) or telepathically (in the manner of Rarys telepathic bond) with any dragon he or she could see. They could also cast a silent image once a day of any dragon he or she had seen with their own eyes.\nThey could also call to any dracolich or evil dragon by name, although this did not guarantee that the creature would respond or arrive, or be helpful. The dragon or dracolich knew the wearers location and could use it to locate them. The call continued until the user ended it, removed the ring, or died.\nWhen worn with one of the six amulets of draconic might an individual became immune to the fear effects of dragons and were well-protected from their breath attacks. Furthermore they gained the powerful ability to command dracoliches, as if they were a cleric commanding lesser undead. This power could be used on living, evil-aligned dragons as well, with a chance they could resist its effects. Due to the dangers of attempting to compel a living dragon, this power was seldom used on willful, living dragons.\nThe command powers granted by wearing a ring of dragons in conjunction with an amulet of draconic might was believed to be responsible for the flight of dragons that occurred in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR.\nForging of a ring of dragons required the spells detect thoughts, sending, silent image, and tongues."
