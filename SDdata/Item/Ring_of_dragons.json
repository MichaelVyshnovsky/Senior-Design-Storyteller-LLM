        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of dragons''''' was a magic ring that, as the name suggested, bestowed [[dragon]]-related powers. They were highly coveted, and used by the [[Cult of the Dragon]], particularly within their leadership. By [[1372 DR]], 70 or so rings had been crafted.\n\nEach ring was worth around 25,000 [[gold piece]]s.",
        "Description": "It was a [[brass]] ring that resembled a dragon or serpent biting its own tail.",
        "Powers": "The wearer could communicate verbally (such as by ''[[tongues]]'') or telepathically (in the manner of ''[[Rary's telepathic bond]]'') with any dragon he or she could see. They could also cast a ''[[silent image]]'' once a day of any dragon he or she had seen with their own eyes.\n\nThey could also call to any [[dracolich]] or evil dragon by name, although this did not guarantee that the creature would respond or arrive, or be helpful. The dragon or dracolich knew the wearer's location and could use it to locate them. The call continued until the user ended it, removed the ring, or died.\n\nWhen worn with one of the six ''[[Amulet of draconic might|amulets of draconic might]]'' an individual became immune to the ''fear'' effects of dragons and were well-protected from their breath attacks. Furthermore they gained the powerful ability to command dracoliches, as if they were a cleric commanding lesser [[undead]]. This power could be used on living, [[evil]]-aligned dragons as well, with a chance they could resist its effects. Due to the dangers of attempting to compel a living dragon, this power was seldom used on willful, living dragons.",
        "History": "The ''command'' powers granted by wearing a ''ring of dragons'' in conjunction with an ''amulet of draconic might'' was believed to be responsible for the [[flight of dragons]] that occurred in the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]].",
        "Creation": "Forging of a ''ring of dragons'' required the [[spell]]s ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[sending]]'', ''[[silent image]]'', and ''[[tongues]]''."
