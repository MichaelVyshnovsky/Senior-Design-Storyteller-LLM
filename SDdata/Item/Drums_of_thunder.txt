Drums of thunder were a pair of magical drums from the land of Kara-Tur that could produce a variety of different effects.
These drums were rather small and adorned with tassels. They were also fitted with a harness, allowing the drummer to fasten them to their waist.
When played, drums of thunder could produce any of the following effects, though only one at a time, which each required charges allow the drummer to fly for ten minutes (one charge), cast cloud trapeze for ten minutes (three charges), cast control weather (one charge), unleash various lightning bolts (five charges), or produce an effect similar to drums of panic (two charges).
