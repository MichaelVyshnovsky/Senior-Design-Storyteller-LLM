        "mainbody": "A yo-yo of fate was a rare and quite valuable magic yo-yo that carried the power to alter the course of ones fate in any given situation. They were particularly created to be used by bards or bardic jesters.\nThese yo-yos differed little in appearance from that of the mundane childs toy. They had a bright, cherry-red color to them and their strings radiated a faint yellow glow. Each instance of these yo-yos varied in its length of string, but typically had around .\nThe primary power of a yo-yo of fate was to alter the probability of events in any given situation to lean in the wielders favor or make them \"get lucky\". When this power was activated the yo-yo of fates string would shorten by , though it could be made to lose even further length depending upon how much the wielder wanted to alter the probability of events. Once a yo-yo of fate ran out of string its magical qualities permanently disappeared, rendering it as the mundane childs toy.\nAdditionally, when wielded in the hands of a bard or jester, the yo-yo of fate passively improved their abilities by a small margin.\n* Dirk Ithbreeiur, a master thief and devout Maskarran, owned a yo-yo of fate that had a full  of string."
