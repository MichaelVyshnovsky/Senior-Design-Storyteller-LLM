        "mainbody": "A '''''yo-yo of fate''''' was a rare and quite valuable [[magic item|magic]] [[yo-yo]] that carried the power to alter the course of one's fate in any given situation.{{Cite dragon/134/Bazaar of the Bizarre|44}} They were particularly created to be used by [[bard]]s or bardic [[jester]]s.",
        "Description": "These yo-yos differed little in appearance from that of the mundane child's toy. They had a bright, cherry-red color to them and their strings radiated a faint yellow glow. Each instance of these yo-yos varied in its length of string, but typically had around {{SIrange|3|20|in|long=yes}}.",
        "Powers": "The primary power of a ''yo-yo of fate'' was to alter the probability of events in any given situation to lean in the wielder's favor or make them \"get lucky\". When this power was activated the ''yo-yo of fate's'' string would shorten by {{SI|1|inch|long=yes}}, though it could be made to lose even further length depending upon how much the wielder wanted to alter the probability of events. Once a ''yo-yo of fate'' ran out of string its magical qualities permanently disappeared, rendering it as the mundane child's toy.\n\nAdditionally, when wielded in the hands of a bard or jester, the ''yo-yo of fate'' passively improved their abilities by a small margin.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Dirk Ithbreeiur]], a master [[thief]] and devout [[Maskarran]], owned a ''yo-yo of fate'' that had a full {{SI|20|in|long=yes}} of string.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Annie Would I Lie to You|14}}"
