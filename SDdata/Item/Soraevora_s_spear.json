        "Powers": "''Soraevora's spear'' was enhanced with Angharradh's [[divine]] magic, granting it a ''+2'' [[enchantment]] to damage that guided the spear toward its target. The spear dealt piercing and additional divine damage upon each strike. ''Soraevora's spear's'' unique nature only made it usable by goodly [[elf]] [[favored soul]]s.",
        "History": "This spear's existence predated the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], likely by many centuries. The weapon was entrusted to a favored soul of Angharradh â€“ the [[sun elf]] named [[Soraevora Aeravand]] of Evermeet. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Soraevora's deity sent her visions of doom and the elf embarked on the journey to the [[Sword Coast North]] to stop [[Zehir]], a [[yuan-ti]] interloper deity. ''Soraevora's spear'' accompanied her on the perilous quest."
