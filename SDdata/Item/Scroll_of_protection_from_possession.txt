A scroll of protection from possession was a scroll capable of protecting the reader from any attempts at possession.
Reading this scroll generated a  sphere that moved around the reader, protecting anyone inside the sphere from magical forms of possession or mental control such as a magic jar spell. These effects lasted for ten minutes to one hour, but a small percentage of these scrolls lasted for several hours but conjured a stationary sphere of protection.
Hasan ibn al-Din, a corsair travelling the Great Sea near Zakhara, carried a scroll of protection from possession.
