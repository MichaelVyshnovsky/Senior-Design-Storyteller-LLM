'''''The Left Hand of Darkness''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[sling]] made out of [[mummy]] wrappings found in the tombs of the [[Vale of Shadows]].

==Powers==
The sling possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment and made the wielder immune to all [[disease]]s while they held the weapon in their hands.

==History==
''The Left Hand of Darkness'' was several centuries old when it was uncovered by the Heroes of Icewind Dale in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. A group of southern heroes ventures into the ancient toms of [[Kresselack]] the Black Wolf, who was laid to rest in the Vale of Shadows on the [[Spine of the World]]. The 1281 DR was marked by danger and misfortune that awoke the ancient warlord and his lieutenants in the form of restless [[undead]]. The heroes returned from the tombs carrying treasures discovered on the walking dead of the Vale; however, the true nature of ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' was not evident at the time. The heroes discovered a piece of [[gold]]en jewelry wrapped in the blackened fabric of a mummy bandage. They thought it nothing but mundane wrappings when the treasures were sold to the northern merchants. In reality, ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' were mummy [[linen]]s off the left hand of one of Kresselack's lieutenants who was raised as undead to serve his master and guard the tomb from vandals and trespassers.

The Heroes of Icewind Dale threw the bandage away in [[Kuldahar]], joking that some urchin would be able to make a sling out of the useless fabric. That was exactly what happened as one quick child snatched the wrappings to be used as a sling. The boy used the sling for hunting small game and as a good luck charm for several years that followed.

By the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' made its way to the town of [[Targos]], possibly traded to the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]]. Noticing the magical nature of the sling, [[Deirdre Gallaway]] put it out for sale in her trading company's store the same year.
