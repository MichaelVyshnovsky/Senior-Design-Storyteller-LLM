The Bellows of Milil was a giant magical pipe organ built into the main temple of Milil in Athkatla.
More than a simple musical instrument, the Bellows was built into the structure of the temple. Playing it caused the whole building to resonate, and some of the sounds it produced could be heard as far as the harbor.
This organ was so large that various creature dwellt within, such as wind walkers and volts. Priests of the clergy, who were the only persons allowed to touch it, also walked into the instrument for cleaning and maintenance purposes.
The instrument could be commanded by three consoles
* The main front seat, with a full set of pedals and four tiers of keyboards, was the one usually used to play tunes.
* A secondary upper console was used to manage swells and hold drone-chords during some of the most intense anthems.
* A hidden interior master console could override the other ones, or even silence the instrument completely. It was mostly used to ensure the security of the repair workers.
The Bellows had several built-in spells that could be triggered by playing specific sequences of chords. Those sequences were chosen in a way that they were unlikely to happen during a normal performance. The following spells were known be usable
* Raise a strong defensive magical barrier around the temple.
* Fire a magical beam at a target near the temple, whether it was on the ground, on the sea, or in the air.
* Some mass teleportation spell, whose precise effects were unknown.
Some of the various passages and chambers composing the organ contained magical portals floating mid-air, connecting the temple to various places other temples, places on Faer√ªn where Milil liked to sojourn, or other planes where he held power.
The sounds created by the instrument when it was played were so intense that they could pulverize the brain of anyone inside at that time. Sorlyn priests however knew how to access and seal off side-chambers within it that would keep them safe in an emergency.
Although most information about the Bellows were kept secret by the temple various rumors circulated regarding the presence of safe rooms and teleportation portals inside it, as well as the presence of strange creatures within it.
Rumors also pretended that a wind dragon roamed the pipes and rooms of the organ.
