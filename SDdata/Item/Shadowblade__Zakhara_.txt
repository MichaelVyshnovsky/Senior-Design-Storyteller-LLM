A shadowblade was an enchanted weapon that also served as a prison for an undead shadow.
Shadowblades were always daggers or a type of sword.
These weapons derived powers from the shadow held by their magic. A shadowblade would temporarily drain a portion of the targets strength each time it broke their flesh. In the tragic event that all of a victims strength was drained, they would transform into a shadow under the complete control of whoever wielded the shadowblade.
Pizentios, a necromancer from the isle of Sahu, carried a scimitar that was a shadowblade.
These weapons could only be safely wielded by individuals with dark hearts. Those pure of heart, or those possessing neutrality is such matters, would have a portion of their strength drained if they attempted to hold a shadowblade.
