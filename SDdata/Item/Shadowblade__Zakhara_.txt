A '''''shadowblade''''' was an [[enchanted]] weapon that also served as a prison for an [[undead]] [[shadow]].

==Description==
''Shadowblades'' were always [[dagger]]s or a type of [[sword]].

==Powers==
These weapons derived powers from the shadow held by their magic. A ''shadowblade'' would temporarily drain a portion of the target's strength each time it broke their flesh. In the tragic event that all of a victim's strength was drained, they would transform into a shadow under the complete control of whoever wielded the ''shadowblade''.

==Notable Owners==
[[Pizentios]], a [[necromancer]] from the isle of [[Sahu]], carried a [[scimitar]] that was a ''shadowblade''.

==History==
These weapons could only be safely wielded by individuals with dark hearts. Those pure of heart, or those possessing neutrality is such matters, would have a portion of their strength drained if they attempted to hold a ''shadowblade''.
