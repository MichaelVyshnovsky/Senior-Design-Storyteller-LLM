Mud armor is a crude form of armor made from drying mud on the skin of the wearer. Only certain types of mud are suited to this purpose, and the armor will crumble into uselessness after a day or two. It takes around ten minutes to apply or wash off mud armor, and it weighs around 8 lb (4 kg). The only creatures known to use mud armor as of 1372 DR were wild dwarves.
