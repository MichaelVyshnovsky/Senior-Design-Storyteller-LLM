A rod of the Dark Lady was a magical rod, created by the faithful of the chromatic dragon deity Tiamat, to aid her followers in their eternal struggles against the clergy of Bahamut.
The rod was made from pure obsidian. It seemed to exude darkness and absorb light in its presence.
The rod could be used as a focus by divine spellcasters, improving their abilities.
Twice per day, the wielder could fire a chromatic ray at a good-aligned dragon. Once per day, they could create an effect similar to shadow of the Dark Queen.
The first rod of the Dark Lady was created by Shudu-Ab, a high priestess of Tiamat in Unther. She saw their use in battle granted a significant advantage to the priests of Tiamat and frustrated the metallic dragons by decreasing their prowess in combat.
