A '''''rod of the Dark Lady''''' was a [[magic]]al rod, created by the faithful of the [[chromatic dragon]] [[deity]] [[Tiamat]], to aid her followers in their eternal struggles against the clergy of [[Bahamut]].

==Description==
The ''rod'' was made from pure [[obsidian]]. It seemed to exude darkness and absorb light in its presence.

==Powers==
The ''rod'' could be used as a [[focus]] by [[divine]] [[spellcaster]]s, improving their abilities.

Twice per day, the wielder could fire a ''[[chromatic ray]]'' at a [[good]]-aligned dragon. Once per day, they could create an effect similar to ''[[shadow of the Dark Queen]]''.

==History==
The first ''rod of the Dark Lady'' was created by [[Shudu-Ab]], a high priestess of Tiamat in [[Unther]]. She saw their use in battle granted a significant advantage to the [[priest]]s of Tiamat and frustrated the [[metallic dragon]]s by decreasing their prowess in combat.
