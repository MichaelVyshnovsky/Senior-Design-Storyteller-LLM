        "mainbody": "Garlic Guy Pie was a baked savory garlic pastry created by Rab Bitnez and featured in his cookbook 101 Garlic Recipes.\nGarlic Guy Pie was cooked using 10 whole heads of garlic, 8 sheets of filo pastry dough bought from the local baker Nell Kirschtorte, goat cheese, copious amounts of butter, and a bit of fresh parsley.\nThe garlic was roasted until soft, then mashed with salt, pepper, and parsley. The garlic mash was mixed with crumbled goat cheese. The baking dish then was buttered, lined with half of the pastry sheets, each layer brushed with more butter. The garlic mash was placed in the dish and covered with the second half of the pastry sheets. Each layer brushed with butter too of course. That was the assembled Garlic Guy Pie. It was baked until ready and served cold or hot."
