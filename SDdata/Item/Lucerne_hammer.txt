'''Lucerne hammers''' were a type of [[polearm]] in the Realms that had an infamous reputation.{{Cite polyhedron/98/A Handful of Dust|16}}{{Cite organized play/LC/A Handful of Dust|37}}

==Description==
At a glance, this weapon bore a resemblance to a [[bec de corbin]]<ref name=drag22-p53">{{Cite dragon/22/The Nomenclature of Pole Arms|53}} or [[military pick]]s. Lucerne hammers had long poles, reaching as long as {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length. These were mounted with a small, clawed three or four-pronged hammer head and sporting an awl spike that was longer than that of a bec de corbin.<ref name=drag22-p53" />{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|25}}

It was not uncommon for the whole weapon to be forged of [[steel]], often gilded with precious metals or decorated with carvings.

==Weaponology==
The lucerne hammer was rather heavy and slow to move. They were designed to pierce heavy armor,<ref> but were also sometimes used to dismount enemies.<ref>{{Cite dragon/178/In Defense of Polearms|29}} The awl spike, rather than being used to pierce armor, was meant to keep enemies at bay.

==Availability==
Places in the Realms where one could purchase lucerne hammers included:
* The [[Weaponers of Cormyr]].

==Notable Lucerne Hammers==
* ''[[The Hammer of Lucerne]]'', an [[enchanted]] lucerne hammer that was commissioned by [[Lodur the Brave]] under the mistaken assumption that it was actually a [[hammer]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Aruma Blane]], a [[monk]] who later came into possession of ''The Hammer of Lucerne''.
* The [[Ravenian]] merchant [[Bendekar]] had a lucerne hammer in his [[Bendekar's House|home's]] expansive weapons collection.

==Trivia==
The entrance to [[Shraevyn's Tomb]] featured a statue of an armored warrior holding a massive lucerne hammer.
