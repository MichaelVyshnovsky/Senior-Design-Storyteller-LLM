A '''''ring of swimming''''' was a [[magic item]] that enhanced its wearer in the water.<ref name="DMG2R-p203>

==Powers==
These rings provided several useful water-related benefits to the wearer. They enhanced the wearer's swimming speed and enabled them to swim for hours without tiring, allowed them to dive safely from up to {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} above water, kept the wearer afloat under all but the most severe weather conditions, and allowed the wearer to hold their breath for four minutes underwater.

==Notable Owners==
[[Setara bint Farid]], a famous [[Corsair (kit)|corsair]] from [[Zakhara]], wore a ''ring of swimming''.
