A '''talisman''' was a [[Wikipedia:Fetishism|fetish]] or item of [[jewelry]] enchanted to act as a [[magic item]]. Talismans were particularly common in the lands of [[Kara-Tur]] and [[Maztica]].
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
A talisman was generally no bigger than a [[holy symbol]] and very light. The form of the talisman was often a clue to its magical power. For example, a talisman shaped like a goldfish scale might grant the user the ability to [[Water breathing|breathe underwater]].

Most talismans were made from natural materials, such as bone, feathers, or dried plants. In some lands, a talisman could be made from [[origami|folded paper]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}} In Maztica, talismans were always items of beauty and symmetry.

==Powers==
Talismans usually granted some sort of benefit or protection to the user, rarely ever any sort of offensive capabilities. Like [[wand]]s or [[potion]]s, the rules of magic usually limited the creation of talismans to weaker spells.

The method of activation for talismans varied but usually involved touching the object and concentrating for a brief moment or speaking a word of command. Anyone could use a talisman's powers; one did not have to be trained in magic to do so. Most (but not all) talismans could be used a single time before their magic was spent. When used, such talismans crumbled away to ash or dust.

Talismans made of [[Sunstone (gem)|sunstone]] had the power to ward off any [[undead]] that were affected by [[sunlight]].

In Maztica, [[Azuposi]] [[priest]]s and special [[Rogue|roughish]] spellcasters called [[fetishist]]s could use talismans to enhance the powers of their [[spell]]s.

==Creation==
In Maztica, two broad categories of talismans were crafted, and it required a [[Create talisman|particular powerful spell]] to create them. These were [[Talisman of pluma|''talismans of pluma'']] and [[Talisman of hishna|''talismans of hishna'']].

In [[Zakhara]], the spell ''[[death talisman]]'' was used to create a special talisman that would perpetually remain in its current condition until the caster's death. For example, a small piece of equipment could be made to resist water damage or decay from age, and it would also fade away into dust when the owner was no longer alive, preventing anyone else from inheriting the item.

==Reputation==
Unlike in other lands, in [[Kuong Kingdom]], [[wu jen]] kept themselves hidden from general society, and the wearing of talismans was used as a secret means of identification.

==Notable Talismans==
Some talismans were more powerful than usual and warrant special mention here:
* The [[Water Ochimo]], a [[spirit]] warrior created by the [[Dead Spirit King]] of the island of [[Akari]] (south of [[Kozakura]]), wore a ''[[talisman of the restless dead]]'', which allowed it to [[Animate dead|Animate]] [[skeleton]]s.
* ''[[Monkey head talisman]]s'' were created by [[Hu Sen]], the "Mad Monkey", to speed the learning of his special style of martial arts.
* The legendary ''[[talisman of pure good]]'' was supposedly used to sink the temple of the evil [[Black Leopard Cult]] to the center of the planet.
* The ''[[Order of the Snake talisman]]'' granted the wearer the ability to invade other people's dreams.
* The [[couatl]] [[Uxma]] possessed a ''[[pluma]]'' talisman that was a kaleidoscope made of feathers. This talisman [[Fire charm|charmed]] those looking at it.
