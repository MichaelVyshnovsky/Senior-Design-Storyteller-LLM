Snake oil was an enchanted green curative oil.
When snake oil was used to anoint special types of green candles, they turned into magical curative items. One such candle could be burned to heal any disease of affliction, similarly to the cure disease spell. Each vial of snake oil held enough to anoint three green candles. Each candle could cure up to four creatures who inhaled its vapors. Snake oil was ineffective against magical afflictions, such as lycanthropy.
The entirety of a vial could also be swallowed. When done so, it acted akin to the neutralize poison spell. When it was rubbed into a wound, it could offer some limited healing.
A vial of snake oil was recovered from the buried and abandoned Temple of Lolth near the trail that led to the town of Mossbridges in the Vast in the . The wizard named Tromor Zemhired hired a team of adventurers from Ravens Bluff to delve into the ruined temples depths. Snake oil and three special green candles were found wrapped in silk and guarded by a raggamoffyn.
