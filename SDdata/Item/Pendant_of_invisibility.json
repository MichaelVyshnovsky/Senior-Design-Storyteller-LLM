        "mainbody": "A pendant of invisibility was a magic item that rendered the wearer invisible.\nIt usually took the form of a diamond suspended on a silver chain so it could be worn as an amulet.\nThe wearer could use the pendant to turn themselves invisible, as per the spell invisibility. This worked thrice a dayThe duration of the invisibility effect is not stated in Dungeon #112. The equivalent duration of the spell in 3.5-edition rules is assumed here.\nCreating one required skill in crafting wonderous items and the spell invisibility.\nA pendant of invisibility was valued at 7,200 gold pieces.\nOne day in the early 1490s DR, Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore made a smash-and-grab robbery of a store selling gems and jewelry. Holga gifted one piece, a jeweled pendant, to Edgins four-year-old daughter Kira, who, to their surprise, promptly disappeared simply by touching it. Fortunately, she soon reappeared with what they realized what was a pendant of invisibility. She would later use the pendant of invisibility to aid them in their heists and to sneak around Castle Never in Neverwinter and finally to help Edgin, Holga, Simon Aumar, and Doric defeat the Red Wizard of Thay Sofina.\n* Kira, daughter of Edgin Darvis"
