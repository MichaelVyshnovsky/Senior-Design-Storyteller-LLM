        "mainbody": "'''Jingasa''' was a type of [[helmet]] used in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "The jingasa was a basic headgear worn by common soldiers. It was essentially an [[iron]] adaptation of the round [[straw hat]] traditionally worn by peasants. Unlike more elaborate helmets, the jingasa lacked protective guards for the ears, cheeks, and back of the neck. Nevertheless, its practicality was appreciated as it doubled as a makeshift [[cooking pot]] during military campaigns.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Shugenja]] were known to wear jingasa."
