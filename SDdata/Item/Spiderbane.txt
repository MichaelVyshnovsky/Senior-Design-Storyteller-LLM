'''''Spiderbane''''' was a [[battleaxe]] that was the favored [[weapon]] of [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], the [[gnome]] [[deity]] of stone, mining and the deep underground.<ref name=frcs-3e-p240">

==Powers==
This ''+3 battleaxe'' was, as its named implied, a bane to [[spider]]s. When either a [[drow]] or a spider was struck with an accurate blow, it was slain outright with no chance to resist.
