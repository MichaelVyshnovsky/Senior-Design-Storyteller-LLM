        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of nine lives''''' was a magic [[ring]] that healed its wearer.",
        "Description": "It was an [[ivory]] ring with the face of a snarling [[cat]].",
        "Powers": "If the wearer was beaten unconscious or left dying, one of the ring's \"lives\" would be used automatically to cast a ''[[heal]]'' spell on the wearer. Also, if the wearer needed extremely quick reflexes, strong willpower, or extreme fortitude, he or she could instead use one of the \"lives\" for this purpose.",
        "Creation": "Creation of a such a ring required the ''heal'' and ''[[limited wish]]'' [[spell]]s.",
        "Cost": "One of these rings was worth around 70,000 [[gold piece]]s if all \"lives\" were intact, but usually these rings were found with some of the \"lives\" used up."
