        "mainbody": "Chameleon leather armor was a type of armor used on Toril.\nThe name \"chameleon leather\" was a misnomer, as it was actually made from the treated hide of an ophidian, not the skin of a chameleon. The breastplate and shoulders of the armor were stiffened by boiling in oil. The rest of the armor remained tough, but flexible. The armor did maintain a fraction of the color-changing abilities that the ophidian once possessed. Chamelon leather could only be crafted by a master leatherworker.\nChameleon armor was only commonly found in communities near the Serpent Hills. Any serpentfolk who encountered non-serpentfolk wearing chameleon leather would treat the wearers with disdain or hostility."
