        "Description": "This oversized yet uncannily lightweight club was created using a clutched fist of a [[petrified]] [[ogre]].",
        "Powers": "''Mountain Fist'' possessed the ''+2'' enchantments and increased the wielder's strength. When used against [[construct]]s, ''Mountain Fist''  became a devastating ''+5'' enchanted weapon.",
        "History": "''Mountain Fist'' was a fabled magic item that originated from the dwarves of pre-[[Weeping War]] [[Myth Drannor]]. According to a legend, the master of the ''Mountain Fist'' fell to the chilly life-draining touch of [[shadow]]s sometime in the past. Returning to existence as a [[shadow]], the master of the ''Mountain Fist'' slithered into the deepest parts of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] along with the enchanted weapon.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], ''Mountain Fist'' could be found inside a chest in the [[Deep Halls]] of the Dwarven Dungeons guarded by [[skeleton]] lords and [[shadow]]s. Once the chest was opened, the ancient master of the enchanted club appeared out of the inky darkness of the dungeon along with two other [[shade]]s attacking the people who dared to take its treasure.\n\nThe blind [[cleric]] of [[Mystra]] [[Beriand]] was familiar with the weapon's lore and shared the legend with the group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] who were making their way through the ruins in order to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s plot to corrupt the city's ''[[mythal]]'' and ''[[pool of radiance]]''."
