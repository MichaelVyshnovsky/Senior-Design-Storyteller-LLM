Fire Knife medallions were enchanted amulets worn by the members of the Fire Knives assassins guild of Westgate.
Fire Knife medallions were small silver disks with an etching of a downward stiletto, the symbol of the infamous assassins guild. These medallions were worn underneath clothes by the assassins of the guild and shown only to other members of their deadly organization. They were used as a method of identification.
These items possessed enchantments that aided assassins in their illicit activities. They magically improved the wearers trap-making and trap disabling skills and allowed them to use the flare spell at will. Fire Knife medallions were enchanted only to be used by rogues and assassins.
