Arc welders were prototype dwarven tools intended for welding metal using electricity, but in the hands of an artificer they functioned similarly to Eberronian rune arms. Several of these novel devices could be found in the dwarven city of Tethyamar on Faer√ªn.
Arc welders consisted of a main device and separate power-supply materials that connected to a slot on the back. Many safety precautions were recommended when operating arc welders, including but not limited to avoiding looking directly into the aperture, not pointing the welder at non-metal apparatuses while powered, keeping the device out of water, not attempting to disassemble the device or power-supply materials, and wearing safety goggles when operating the welder.
Depending on if it was a short- or long-range variant, arc welders could either discharge a wide field or a single long beam of electricity, with the power building up over time. In addition, in the hands of an artificer the device passively increased the potency of their electricity-based spells and made their other weapons more deadly, including electrifying them. It also made it easier to stun, trip, and pierce the armor of an opponent.
Prototype arc welders were found in and around the mines of Tethyamar in the , during Hal Stouthearts expedition to the mines of Tethyamar. A long-range welder could be found in Mineshaft 214S with the mad dwarf Egil Hakon, while a short-range welder was in the possession of the drider slaver Phyxzar at a drow camp.
