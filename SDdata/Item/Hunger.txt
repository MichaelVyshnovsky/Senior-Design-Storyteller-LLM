'''''Hunger''''' was a [[cursed]] [[longsword]] found to the east of [[Darkmoon]]'s silver tower.

|The blade that has eaten so much.

==Description==
When the [[sword]] was equipped, the wielder had a lower chance to hit with it than with a regular sword, equivalent to a ''âˆ’2'' enchantment. As well as this effect, the sword's owner would consume food at double their regular rate, for the same amount of nourishment. This made them a liability in scenarios involving scarce sources of rations, owing to their seemingly insatiable hunger.

Either ''Hunger'' or ''[[Leech (polearm)|Leech]]'' was required as the key to solving a riddle, requested by an animated mouth. Once the mouth was satisfied, it was possible to progress further into Temple Darkmoon.
