Hunger was a cursed longsword found to the east of Darkmoons silver tower.
When the sword was equipped, the wielder had a lower chance to hit with it than with a regular sword, equivalent to a âˆ’2 enchantment. As well as this effect, the swords owner would consume food at double their regular rate, for the same amount of nourishment. This made them a liability in scenarios involving scarce sources of rations, owing to their seemingly insatiable hunger.
Either Hunger or Leech was required as the key to solving a riddle, requested by an animated mouth. Once the mouth was satisfied, it was possible to progress further into Temple Darkmoon.
