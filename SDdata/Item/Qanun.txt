A '''''qanun''''' ({{Pronounce|kah|NOON}}) was a [[Zakhara]]n stringed instrument similar to the [[zither]] found elsewhere on [[Toril|al-Toril]].{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

==Description==
A ''qanun'' was a trapezoidal box consisting of 24 to 36 courses. Each course encompassed 3 wound strings made from gut. The strings on an extremely valuable ''qanun'' could be made from enchanted silk. A set of hooked rings were used to entice sound from the strings.

==History==
The ''qanun'' was a larger instrument but remained fairly portable. It was a common site among the bazaars and ''suqs'' of the Land of Fate.
