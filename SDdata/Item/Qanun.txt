A qanun () was a Zakharan stringed instrument similar to the zither found elsewhere on al-Toril.
A qanun was a trapezoidal box consisting of 24 to 36 courses. Each course encompassed 3 wound strings made from gut. The strings on an extremely valuable qanun could be made from enchanted silk. A set of hooked rings were used to entice sound from the strings.
The qanun was a larger instrument but remained fairly portable. It was a common site among the bazaars and suqs of the Land of Fate.
