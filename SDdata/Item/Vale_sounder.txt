Vale sounders were magical horns used to defend the Welcome Gates in the Visitorsâ€™ Vale on the island of Suj.
Vale sounders were iron horns  in length with a dual-tone output.
Upon activation, they emitted a shrill screech alongside a deep thrum, creating a cacophony of sound waves that clashed disharmoniously. This sonic assault radiated in a  cone. The sounders low rumble caused the ground to shake intensely.
Creatures caught within the sonic cone lost concentration due to the horns ear-piercing shriek and became deaf for several days. The silence spell mitigated these effects, although it did not prevent the ground quakes.
