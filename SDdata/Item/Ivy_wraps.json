        "mainbody": "Ivy wraps were a pair of magical handwraps found in the Druids Deep of Thorngap in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.\nThe handwraps were made of leather and tied with knotted thorny vines.\nThe thorns on the ivy wraps were savage and caused deep hemorrhaging wounds, as well as draining blood and healing the user in a vampiric manner. The thorns oozed virulent poisons and toxins, even causing acidic secondary reactions that further burned the recipient.\nThe handwraps were found in the Druids Deep of Thorngap when adventurers pursued the insane druid Halsaime. They were in the possession of the bog hag Aghilde, who lurked nearby."
