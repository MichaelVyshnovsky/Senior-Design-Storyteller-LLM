'''''Namji's robe''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[wizard]]'s [[robe]] that once belonged to a famed mage of [[Thesk]], [[Namji]].

==Powers==
This red robe possessed meager magical defenses but possessed enchantments that ''[[regenerate]]d'' the wearer's wounds.

==History==
''Namji's robe'' was created by Namji, a battlemage of Thesk, long before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. The robe was lost until 1281 DR, when it was recovered from an old shipwreck on the island of an [[undead]] [[white dragon]] [[Icasaracht]], on [[Lac Dinneshere]] in [[Icewind Dale]].
