'''''Gauntlets of flaming fury''''' were magical [[gauntlet]]s that imbued their wearer's weapons with magic and [[fire]].

==Description==
The gauntlets were made from steel.

==Powers==
When worn, the gauntlets temporarily transformed any mundane weapon into a magical one. The gauntlets also allowed the wearer to surround a melee weapon with magical flames. This flame lasted as long as the wearer held the weapon or until it was sheathed. The magical abilities of the gauntlets could only be used once every 24 hours.

==Notable Owners==
The [[minotaur]] [[Torogar Steelfist]], who served in [[Avernus]] as [[Arkhan]]'s bodyguard, wore a pair of ''gauntlets of flaming fury''.
