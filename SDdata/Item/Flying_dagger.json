        "mainbody": "A flying dagger was a magical dagger that was typically around 9 in (23 cm) in length and could be given a trigger that would cause it to activate and attack a particular individual or type of creature. Due to the methods behind their creation, flying daggers were not brittle and wouldnot rust. Some daggers might reflect or be immune to certain magic, or cause metal items to rust instantly upon contact, or potentially other properties. As of 1368 DR, one of these daggers was worth around 15,000 gold pieces."
