The intensity of this light was about that of a continual light spell. Everyone but Vhaeraun within 70 ft. (21.34 m) who saw this light went blind for two to five minutes\nHow Vhaeraun came to own Shadowflash was unknown. The short sword was his favored weapon. His clerics preferred the usage of a short sword too. They often mastered a combat style called sarghelgg with a short sword.\nThe sword was also used in his assassination attempt against Eilistraee."
