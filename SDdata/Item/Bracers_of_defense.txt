Bracers of defense were protective magical items.
Typical bracers of defense found after the Second Sundering were hollow with an intricate golden pattern.
The power of the bracers could only be accessed if the attuned wearer had no armor and no shield. Their magic worked by increasing the chance of attacks (magical or otherwise) to miss the wearer.
