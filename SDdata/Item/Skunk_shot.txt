Skunk shot was a type of mage shot that consisted of a large stone filled with foul-smelling liquid.
When this projectile was shot from a siege weapon, the stone would shatter and release its contents. When the fluid was exposed to air, such as within a spelljammers air envelope, it would rapidly evaporate into a toxic green cloud, as per the spell stinking cloud. This vapor affected anyone within its radius in a similar manner to the spell.
