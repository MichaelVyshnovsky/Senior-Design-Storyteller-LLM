        "mainbody": "The '''''Lupinaxe''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[axe]] whose head resembled a [[wolf]]. It belonged first to the [[human]] [[ranger]] [[Arielimnda]] and then to her husband [[Arun Maerdrym]], both the parents of [[Khelben Arunsun]].",
        "Powers": "The axe had several powers. First, it could summon a [[dire wolf]]. On contact with a foe, the axe emitted a howling noise like a wolf. If thrown, after contact, the axe would teleport back to the hand of its wielder.",
        "History": "The axe was used notably by Arun Maerdrym and his son Khelben in the {{YearlinkName|464}} in [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]] to stop the [[vampire]] [[wizard]] [[Palron Kaeth]] and his allied [[phaerimm]]. The two agreed to sacrifice themselves by using the axe to shatter Khelben's ''[[Duskstaff of Sarael]]''. This act obliterated Arun and Khelben and eliminated their enemies in the process, leaving a crater of glass behind."
