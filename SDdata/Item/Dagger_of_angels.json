        "mainbody": "The '''''dagger of angels''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[elf|elven]] [[dagger]] that once belonged to an [[Akh'Velahr]] war party leader, [[Victoria]], who died in the [[Weeping War]].",
        "Description": "The aptly-named ''dagger of angels'' had [[angel]] wings-shaped hilt.",
        "Powers": "This dagger possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment and its magics increased the wielder's constitution. Additionally, it held three charges of the ''[[raise dead]]'' spell.",
        "History": "During the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading [[Army of Darkness]] and met her demise in the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victoria's gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. The ''dagger of angels'' never reached the [[Underdark]] as a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs."
