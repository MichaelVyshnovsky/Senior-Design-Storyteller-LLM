        "mainbody": "The dagger of angels was a unique enchanted elven dagger that once belonged to an AkhVelahr war party leader, Victoria, who died in the Weeping War.\nThe aptly-named dagger of angels had angel wings-shaped hilt.\nThis dagger possessed a powerful +5 enchantment and its magics increased the wielders constitution. Additionally, it held three charges of the raise dead spell.\nDuring the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading Army of Darkness and met her demise in the Elven Catacombs. In 1369 DR, the drow of House Freth were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victorias gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. The dagger of angels never reached the Underdark as a group of adventurers from Phlan destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs."
