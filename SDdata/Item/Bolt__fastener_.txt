Bolts and nuts were metal fasteners that were used in metalworking, carpentry, and construction. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included nails, spikes, and pegs.
Bolts were typically less than  long and  or less in diameter. Their most important feature was their thread, which allowed a nut to attach and hold the materials in place.
A similar, simpler fastener was the link bolt, a clevis pin that had no thread and instead used an eyehole and pin to hold the rod in place, often tightened with the insertion of shims.

Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a selection of bolts, nuts, and related tools in various configurations and sizes. Bolts were available from  long and able to be cut to length, in ¼", ½", ¾", and  diameters for 3 gp/lb, and with fine and coarse threads. Variously-fitted nuts were available for 2 gp/lb.
For the most part, around the 1370s DR finely-made threaded screws and bolts were treated as "holy secrets of Gond" and used in temples, furniture, and devices built and owned by that faith. Link bolts were far more common, with human, dwarf, and gnome smiths producing them widely across the Sword Coast and Shining Sea of western Faerûn.
