        "mainbody": "The '''''Crown of Horns''''' was an [[evil]], [[Sentient item|intelligent]] [[artifact]] of great power. While its origins were murky, the ''Crown'' was believed to have been forged either in ancient [[Netheril]], or by [[Myrkul]], the former god of Death.\n{{Quote|We found an artifact, the Crown of Horns, and I in my pride decided that my powers of will and magic were sufficient to counter the evil I sensed within it. I wore the Crown, and it claimed me as its own. Years went by, terrible years during which I lost Laeral and became the Wild Woman, the Witch of the North. I remember little of those years, which in many ways is a blessing.|[[Laeral Silverhand]], in a letter to her nephew [[Danilo Thann]], [[Ches 3]], [[1368 DR]].}}",
        "Description": "In its original form this crown was a [[helmet]] made of [[electrum]] and fully covered with small horns, and a row of black [[gem]]s, the center one of which was black [[diamond]].\n\nAfter its destruction and subsequent reformation, the ''Crown of Horns'' appeared as a silver circlet with a black diamond set on the brow and four bone horns mounted around its edge.",
        "Powers": "It is unknown what powers the artifact had before it was possessed by Myrkul other than its sentience and its capability to interfere with the minds of its wearers. After its possession however, the ''Crown'' imbued the wearer with several considerable necromantic powers. They were granted an aura of [[undeath]] similar to those that surrounded [[lich]]es, became immune to [[necromantic]] spells and all manner of [[death magic]].\n\nFollowing the god's destruction, the vestiges of Myrkul could strongly influence the actions of whomever wore the ''Crown of Horns'', making suggestions within their consciousness, possessing them outright, and even altering their [[alignment|moral and ethical outlook]] to [[neutral evil|more closely resemble]] his own. No individual could remove their crown unless Myrkul's essence wished for his artifact to find a new host.\n\nOver time, anyone wearing the crown became increasingly paranoid, specifically about their possession of the ''Crown'' itself. Eventually, they succumbed to the call of madness and undeath, and became a lich themself.\n\nAdditional powers the ''Crown'' possessed or granted to its wearer, included:\n* The power to ''[[command undead]]''.\n* A ''fear aura'' similar to that possessed by liches.\n* An aura that compelled anyone within a {{SI|100|ft}} radius to claim the ''Crown'' for themself.\n* The ability to ''[[teleport without error]]'' once every [[tenday]].\n* Emit the unique ''ray of undeath'', which slew creatures where they stood and raised them as [[lesser shadowrath]].\n* ''Myrkul's Hand'', which surrounded the wearers hands with black flames; their touch engulfed creatures in dark conflagration, possibly transforming them into [[greater shadowrath]]s.",
        "History": "The origins regarding the ''Crown of Horns'' were not entirely clear. Some scholars believed it was created by the God of Death, Myrkul himself,\n\nIt was said that in {{Yearlink|-2237}}, the ''Crown'' exploded while being worked on by Trebbe, destroying an entire block of the enclave. The ''Crown'' itself wasn't destroyed, but it was lost.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1423}}, the ''Crown'' was seen again, this time in the hands of another archwizard, [[Requiar]]. Requiar used it to slay 30 other archwizards and conquer Shadowtop Borough. The artifact drove Requiar mad though and he was rendered incapable. After the insensate arcanist was overthrown, his killers searched for the ''Crown'' but despite powerful divinations, a thorough search of the city, and many parties of adventurers scouring the [[Eastern Forest]] over the next 150 years, they failed to find it.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-644}}, the ''Crown'' was finally rediscovered by the archwizard Shadelorn. Shadelorn was working on a project to succeed where [[Ioulaum]] had failed in creating an improved [[mythallar]]. In {{Yearlink|-342}}, another archwizard, Shenandra, was working on countering the ''[[lifedrain]]'' magic of the [[phaerimm]] at the same time. As misfortune would have it, the two successfully completed their projects at precisely the same time on Shadowtop Borough. The ''Crown'', wanting revenge on the city for its previous defeat, had been imperceptibly corrupting Shadelorn's work and when he activated his new mythallar, it drained all magic and memorized spells from everything and everyone within a 20-mile radius. The enclave fell, its inhabitants died, the threat from the phaerimm persisted and the only thing to survive intact was the ''Crown''.\n\nAt one point, the ''Crown'' was in the possession of the Netherese [[lich]] [[Aumvor the Undying]], who wished to use the crown to make [[Laeral Silverhand]] his bride by leaving it for her adventuring band, [[The Nine]], to find. Laeral donned the crown in the {{YearlinkName|1337}}, but Aumvor's plot failed when the ''Crown'''s powers conflicted with Laeral Silverhand's [[spellfire]] power and drove her into madness.\n\nEventually, Khelben was forced to beseech his goddess [[Mystra]] for aid, and challenged Laeral to a terrible spell duel in the [[High Forest]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the ''Crown'' was sundered by her future consort, the archmage [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]], who locked its pieces away within the heavily protected walls of his tower, [[Blackstaff Tower]]. However, when Myrkul died at [[Midnight|Midnight's]] hand during the [[Time of Troubles]] that same year, the god tore the broken shards of the ''Crown'' from Blackstaff Tower, reforged it into a new shape, and infused it with the remains of his sentience before teleporting away.\n\nMyrkul, through the ''Crown'', continued to spread evil through the Realms, tormenting members of the Church of [[Cyric]] as well as hapless innocents, avoiding allies of Khelben and temples of [[Mystra]].\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the ''Crown of Horns'' was in the possession of a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] Horned Harbinger named [[Nhyris D'Hothek]]. He had eventually disappeared from his haunts in [[Skullport]] after the ''Crown'' transformed him into a lich-like being. \n\nThere remained conflicting accounts regarding the ''Crown's'' whereabouts in the decades that followed. It was said by some that Nhyris lost the ''Crown of Horns'', but retained the horrific transformations it had inflicted upon his form.{{Cite dungeon/200/Backdrop: Skullport|10}}",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Following the fall of Netheril, a group of surviving arcanists fashioned the helmet ''[[The Black Hands of Shelgoth]]'' out of the remains of the [[lich]] [[Shelgoth]]. Later historians speculated that this was an attempt to create an item similar to the ''Crown of Horns''.\n\nThe ''ray of undeath'' let loose by the ''Crown'' was said to resemble [[Rundorl Moonsklan#History|\"spell of Undeath\"]], as described by the self-proclaimed Harper King [[Rundorl Moonsklan]].\n\nIt was rumored that the ''Crown of Horns'' could be destroyed by being placed upon the brow of [[Kelemvor]], who succeeded Myrkul's replacement as the God of Dead, or by being submerged in the blood of the divine [[avatar]] of [[Garqos the Reaver]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Nhyris D'Hothek]], a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] from [[Skullport]] who bore the ''Crown'' for over a year."
