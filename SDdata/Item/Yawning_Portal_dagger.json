        "Description": "Most of the ''Yawning Portal daggers'' were masterfully crafted but dulled due to heavy use and time. Their hilts bore markings of the creator, a hidden [[wizard]]ly cabal from somewhere on the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Powers": "Despite bearing a ''+2'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand toward the target, ''Yawning Portal daggers'' were far from being deadly weapons, dealing less damage due to their dull blades.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Durnan]], the proprietor of the Yawning Portal, supplied his guests with these enchanted daggers."
