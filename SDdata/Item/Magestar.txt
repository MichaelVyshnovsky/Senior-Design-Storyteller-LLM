A '''''magestar''''' was an enchanted globe that could absorb [[spell]]s cast at them.

==Description==
''Magestar''s were metal globes that had many spines. A ''magestar'' gave off light and hovered near its wielder, resembling a [[will-o'-wisp]].

==Powers==
A ''magestar'' would absorb incoming spells and convert the magical energy into fortitude to make it stronger. The ''magestar'' could pass this stored power onto its wielder as healing energy whenever the wielder wished, or the ''magestar'' would do so automatically if they fell or were rendered unconscious.

Anyone capable of casting spells would become the new owner of a ''magestar'' if they simply touched the globe. ''Magestar''s would wither away if they did not absorb enough magical energy, but absorbing too much would cause them to explode and harm anyone nearby.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Tessaril Winter]], the warrior and [[wizard]] of [[Eveningstar]], carried a ''magestar''.
*[[Whisper]], a mage in service of the [[Zhentarim]] in the 15{{th}} century DR.
