A magestar was an enchanted globe that could absorb spells cast at them.
Magestars were metal globes that had many spines. A magestar gave off light and hovered near its wielder, resembling a will-o-wisp.
A magestar would absorb incoming spells and convert the magical energy into fortitude to make it stronger. The magestar could pass this stored power onto its wielder as healing energy whenever the wielder wished, or the magestar would do so automatically if they fell or were rendered unconscious.
Anyone capable of casting spells would become the new owner of a magestar if they simply touched the globe. Magestars would wither away if they did not absorb enough magical energy, but absorbing too much would cause them to explode and harm anyone nearby.
