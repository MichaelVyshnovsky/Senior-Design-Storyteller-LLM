'''''Laeral's anklets''''' were a unique set of [[enchanted]] jewelry that surrounded the wearer with a field of force.

==Description==
Tiny padlocks adorned the [[anklet]]s.

==Powers==
The anklets were imbued with the ''[[everbright]]'' [[armor quality]], ensuring they would never tarnish while also granting the wearer some resistance to [[acid]]. The anklets protected the wearer from harm by creating an invisible field of force around them. The magic only protected the wearer if both anklets were worn at the same time.

==Notable Owners==
This item was created and worn by [[Laeral Silverhand]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The presence of the padlocks lead many to suspect that Laeral was [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s unwilling prisoner. Interestingly, Laeral never denied the rumors, leading many who sought her favor to challenge Khelben.
