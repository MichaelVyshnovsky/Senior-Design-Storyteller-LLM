'''''Potions of female form''''' were [[enchanted|magic]] [[potion]]s that changed the imbiber's body to that of a female of their species.

==Powers==
When consumed, a ''potion of female form'' transformed the drinker's body into that of a woman. It was believed that the potion's effects lasted only for twenty-four hours. However, that was not always the case. There was a ten percent chance that the transformation was permanent and could only be reversed through the ''[[wish]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Church of Selûne]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] sought to retrieve and destroy the ''[[obsidian amulet of the Dark Maiden]]'' – the prison of [[Jessar]], the dark goddess enemy of [[Selûne]]. The [[amulet]] could only be handled by a woman equipped with a special [[silver]] gauntlet in order to avoid being possessed by the deity. All men who touched the amulet were immediately destroyed, and their souls consumed. The [[Temple of Selûne (Ravens Bluff)|Temple of Selûne]] assembled groups of adventurers of the Living City to send them in search of the artifact. Those groups lacking females were offered these potions, promising temporary effects lasting only a day.
