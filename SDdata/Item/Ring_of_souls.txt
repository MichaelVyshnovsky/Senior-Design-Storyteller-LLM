The ring of souls was a unique enchanted ring from the ruins of the City of Song, Myth Drannor.
The ring of souls was a delicate band of silver with a tiny locket.
The ring allowed the wearer to cast a powerful version of the halt undead spell. The ring found in Myth Drannor had four charges left.
In 1369 DR, the ring of souls could be found in one of the many deep chambers of the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor, controlled by the forces of Cult of the Dragon and the drow of the noble House Freth. The ring was conveniently left by a powerful undead, defeated via the rings power sometime before 1369 DR.
