Rakshasa hide was a kind of hide armor found in Eberron.
The armor closely resembled a tigerskin outfit, being made from the tanned hide of a rakshasa.
The hide gave the bearer many of the same innate abilities that rakshasas had. It improved their awareness, aim, and reaction speed, and produced a roar that frightened attackers.
A suit of rakshasa armor was taken from (or made from) the rakshasa Tahmael, who was at the Lords of Dust safehouse in Stormreach when the Church of the Silver Flame attacked, during a plot to release the Overlord Spinner of Shadows.
