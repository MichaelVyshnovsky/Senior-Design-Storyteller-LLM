        "mainbody": "rc battle armor was a type of enchanted light armor, used by the Many-Arrows orcs in the 15 century DR.\nThese sets of emblazoned armor were strengthened with +1 and +2 enchantments to reinforce the wearers instincts to charge furiously into the fray and destroy opponents who suffered significant damage. This raging enchantment kicked in when the wearer themselves suffered significant harm, similar to an orcs blood rage.\nIn the 15 century DR, orc battle armor could be found worn by orcs of the Sword Mountains, and sold in the Mercenary Arms Depot of Neverwinter, as well as recovered from the ruins of Illefarn."
