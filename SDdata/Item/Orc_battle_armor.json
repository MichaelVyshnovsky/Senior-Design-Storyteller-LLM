        "mainbody": "'''''Orc battle armor''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[light armor]], used by the [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "These sets of emblazoned armor were strengthened with ''+1'' and ''+2'' enchantments to reinforce the wearer's instincts to charge furiously into the fray and destroy opponents who suffered significant damage. This raging enchantment kicked in when the wearer themselves suffered significant harm, similar to an orc's blood rage.",
        "History": "In the 15{{th}} century DR, ''orc battle armor'' could be found worn by orcs of the [[Sword Mountains]], and sold in the Mercenary Arms Depot of [[Neverwinter]], as well as recovered from the ruins of [[Illefarn]]."
