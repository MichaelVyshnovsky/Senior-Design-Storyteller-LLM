        "mainbody": "elts of Valindras guard were enchanted belts that were created to be boons for Valindra Shadowmantles most powerful minions in the late 15 century DR.\nThe wearers of these belts received boosts to their vitality, accuracy, intelligence, charisma, and ability to land lucky devastating strikes. When an amulet of Valindras favor was worn together with a belt of Valindras guard and a shard of Valindras crown, the belt greatly fortified the wearers resistance to enthralling and controlling spells and, in turn, strengthened the wearers own such spells.\nThese belts were given out to the most powerful of Valindra Shadowmantles minions as a sign of favor. After Valindras defeat at the hands of the defenders of Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR, some of these belts were recovered from the villains bodies."
