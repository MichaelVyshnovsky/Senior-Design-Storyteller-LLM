        "mainbody": "'''''Belts of Valindra's guard''''' were [[enchanted]] [[belt]]s that were created to be boons for [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]'s most powerful minions in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The wearers of these belts received boosts to their vitality, accuracy, intelligence, charisma, and ability to land lucky devastating strikes. When an ''[[amulet of Valindra's favor]]'' was worn together with a ''belt of Valindra's guard'' and a ''[[shard of Valindra's crown]]'', the belt greatly fortified the wearer's resistance to enthralling and controlling [[spell]]s and, in turn, strengthened the wearer's own such spells.",
        "History": "These belts were given out to the most powerful of Valindra Shadowmantle's minions as a sign of favor. After Valindra's defeat at the hands of the defenders of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, some of these belts were recovered from the villains' bodies."
