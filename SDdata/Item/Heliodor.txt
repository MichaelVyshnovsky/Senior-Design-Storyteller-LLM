'''Heliodor''' was a variety of [[wikipedia:en:golden beryl|golden beryl]] and considered a [[precious stones|precious stone]] for jewelry and ornamentation. It has some magical uses as well.

==Description==
Heliodor had a deep yellow hue with tints from greenish yellow to reddish yellow and yielded medium to large facet-cut gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 500 gp.

==Powers==
Heliodor gems could be substituted for other naturally-occurring material components (''i.e.'', those that did not require manufacturing or special construction) in all priest spells of the [[sun sphere]]. Crushed heliodor was a required reagent when forging a ''[[sun blade]]''.
