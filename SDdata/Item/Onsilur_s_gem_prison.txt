'''''Onsilur's Gem Prison''''' was a ''[[kiira]]'' of a forgotten [[elven]] house that was used to imprison [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]] at some point between {{yearlink|321}} and {{yearlink|326}}.

==History==
The ''kiira'' belonged to a house unknown as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. [[Ansel Burwyth]] employed it to trap [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]] inside at some point before {{yearlink|326}}, and hid the gem. It was still unfound by the late 14{{th}} century DR, by which point Onsilur went insane after being trapped inside for so long.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|39}}

==Powers==
Onsilur's sentience faintly babbled out from inside the gem in the form of speech or descriptions of memories stored inside the [[kiira]].
