'''Blackstaff wine''' was a type of red [[wine]] from the city of [[Waterdeep]]. It was exported to the [[Western Heartlands]], the lands along the [[River Chionthar]], and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Just like its namesake and the city it was from, the Blackstaff had a big, bright, and unbalanced flavor. It was said to perfectly capture the spirit of the City of Splendors.
