Blackstaff wine was a type of red wine from the city of Waterdeep. It was exported to the Western Heartlands, the lands along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate, as of the late 15 century DR.
Just like its namesake and the city it was from, the Blackstaff had a big, bright, and unbalanced flavor. It was said to perfectly capture the spirit of the City of Splendors.
