Talismans of pure evil were powerful enchanted amulets filled with mind-influencing malice.
There were many designs and variations of these items, indicating them being created by various parties at various points in history.
Talismans of pure evil were believed to be as powerful as an artifact. Even though only evil creatures could wear these amulets, even the darkest of the souls were further twisted and corrupted by these items, plunging them deeper into fiendish evil with each passing day. Additionally, talismans of pure evil significantly increased the wearers charisma and wisdom, as well as granted them increased resistance to magic of arcane, divine, and spell-like creature abilities.
In the late 14 century DR, several of these evil talismans were in existence, found in several places on the Sword Coast, Moonsea, and even as far as Chult. Most often these items were found in ancient tombs and crypts of evil individuals.
