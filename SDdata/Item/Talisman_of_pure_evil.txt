==Description==
There were many designs and variations of these items, indicating them being created by various parties at various points in history.

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several of these evil talismans were in existence, found in several places on the [[Sword Coast]], [[Moonsea]], and even as far as [[Chult]]. Most often these items were found in ancient tombs and crypts of evil individuals.
