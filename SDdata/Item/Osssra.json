        "mainbody": "sssra were oils mainly used by yuan-ti for a plethora of different practical and recreational purposes. There were several kinds of osssra with different scents and effects.\nOsssra were burned in pots or braziers and were inhaled as an ember-colored smoke. Yuan-ti would use them while laying in recreational basking chambers.\nIts uses were varied and many, but only the yuan-ti tended to use them, as they were poisonous to humans and could enfeeble the mind, cause unconsciousness, or be outright fatal. Properties of osssra included clearing the mind, healing the body, purging enchantments, and stimulating dreams and memories (via smells of mint, burning moss, and sap).\nUsing osssra to induce dreaming was used for recreational purposes and was believed to bestow prophetic dreams and help in divining the locations of desired people and objects.\nThe Waterdhavian merchant Phalantar Orivan had long supplied osssra to members of House Sultlue, but around 1372 DR the sale of these oils was banned by the Lords of Waterdeep after it was discovered that they had been used to murder three members of House Thorp. This caused issues of pricing to arise between the two, as Phalantar sought to triple his original asking price, while House Sultlue only wished to pay double it and only for any future shipments. While they worked through their negotiations, Phalantar kept his stock of osssra in thirty-five small amphoras within a storeroom that had once belonged to Artor Morlin."
