        "mainbody": "'''''Osssra''''' were oils mainly used by [[yuan-ti]] for a plethora of different practical and recreational purposes. There were several kinds of osssra with different scents and effects.",

Properties of ''osssra'' included clearing the mind, healing the body, purging enchantments, and stimulating dreams and memories (via smells of mint, burning moss, and sap).\n\nUsing ''osssra'' to induce dreaming was used for recreational purposes and was believed to bestow prophetic dreams and help in [[Divination|divining]] the locations of desired people and objects.",
        "History": "The [[Waterdhavian]] merchant [[Phalantar Orivan]] had long supplied ''osssra'' to members of [[Sultlue|House Sultlue]], but around [[1372 DR]] the sale of these oils was banned by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] after it was discovered that they had been used to murder three members of [[Thorp (family)|House Thorp]]. This caused issues of pricing to arise between the two, as Phalantar sought to triple his original asking price, while House Sultlue only wished to pay double it and only for any future shipments. While they worked through their negotiations, Phalantar kept his stock of ''osssra'' in thirty-five small [[amphora]]s within a storeroom that had once belonged to [[Artor Morlin]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/127/Vampires of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Crypt|72}}"
