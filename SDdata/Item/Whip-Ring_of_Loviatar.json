        "mainbody": "The Whip-Ring of Loviatar was an enchanted ring, named after Loviatar the Scourge Mistress. It was part of the Fading Rings set.\nThe Whip-Ring was fashioned to resemble a griffons or Loviatars scourge.\nThis enchanted ring enchanted the wearers dexterity and made them more alert and quicker to respond to danger. Additionally, the Whip-Ring of Loviatar allowed the wearer to magically \"whip\" their opponents, similarly to the inflict critical wounds spell. The ring possessed nine charges.\nIn 1369 DR, Whip-Ring of Loviatar came to be possessed by a mysterious monument, the Great Stone Head, located in the Nightingale Court in the ruins of Myth Drannor. In exchange for one of the eidolons, small totem statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings, one being the dangerous Whip-Ring of Loviatar."
