'''Avner's Abyssal Ale''' was a type of alcoholic drink found in the city of [[Zelatar]], on the [[Abyss]]al plane of [[Azzagrat]].

==Description==
This intoxicating drink was a heavy dark type of porter [[beer]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Avner's Abyssal Ale could be purchased from [[demon]]ic breweries and taverns in Zelatar. Unlike many of the drinks favored by the [[fiend]]s who inhabited the realm, Avner's was suitable for consumption by inhabitants of the [[Prime Material plane]]. Further from the Abyss, Avner's Abyssal Ale was served at the Wandering Treant inn on the plane of [[Bytopia]].
