The Kinslayer was a trident enchanted specifically to harm merfolk of Serôs.
The trident possessed a simple +1 enchantment to its damage, and it guided the wielders hand toward the target. When wielded against other merfolk, the weapons effectively became a weapon of death – a powerful +4 enchanted trident. However, that power could only be accessed when the Kinslayer was wielded by a menfolk. Additionally, a merfolk wielder could cast pressure resistance and light spells using the Kinslayer thrice per day each.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Kinslayer was wielded by Ogmard, a merman of Voalidru in Serôs. Since the end of the Twelfth Serôs War, Ogmard considered the Kinslayer to be his most prized possession and the weapon used to slaughter members of the much-hated clan Homurr.
