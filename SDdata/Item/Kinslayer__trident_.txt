The '''''Kinslayer''''' was a [[trident]] [[enchanted]] specifically to harm [[merfolk]] of [[Serôs]].

==Powers==
The trident possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment to its damage, and it guided the wielder's hand toward the target. When wielded against other merfolk, the weapons effectively became a weapon of death – a powerful ''+4'' enchanted trident. However, that power could only be accessed when the ''Kinslayer'' was wielded by a menfolk. Additionally, a merfolk wielder could cast ''[[pressure resistance]]'' and ''[[light]]'' [[spell]]s using the ''Kinslayer'' thrice per day each.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Kinslayer'' was wielded by [[Ogmard]], a merman of [[Voalidru]] in Serôs. Since the end of the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], Ogmard considered the ''Kinslayer'' to be his most prized possession and the weapon used to slaughter members of the much-hated clan [[Homurr]].
