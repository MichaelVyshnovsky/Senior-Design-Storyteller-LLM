Jhannyls wristlet was a magical item used by the Harpers.
This delicate bracelet, crafted from shimmering silver metal and adorned with intricate filigree and dangling charms, possessed abilities that exclusively safeguarded and impacted the wearer. It provided additional protection from attacks, particularly against poison, polymorph, and petrification attacks. The protection provided accumulated alongside the protections provided by other magical items and spells. However, if more than one of these bracelets was worn, their magic negated each other, offering no protective benefits to the wearer whatsoever.
In addition, the bracelet automatically bestowed the ability to breathe underwater whenever the wearer was submerged. It also invoked a feather fall effect whenever the wearer fell or was subjected to reverse gravity magic. Once per day, it effortlessly cured any diseases the wearer encountered. Finally, the bracelet had the power to cast the heal spell on the wearer once per day, either upon the wearers volition or when after significant wounds, whichever came first.
