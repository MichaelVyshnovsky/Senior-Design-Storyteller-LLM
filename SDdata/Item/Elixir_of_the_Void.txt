The '''Elixir of the Void''' was a [[poison]]ous concoction that was used by the [[Church of Shar]] in their initiation rituals.

==Description==
Despite its grand name, the elixir was actually very mundane. It was a mixture of poison and strong alcohol such as [[wine]], intended to mask the poison's bitter taste.

The Church of [[Shar]] would use the Elixir to ensure the outcome of a prospective Sharran's initiation ritual. After being welcomed into the temple, the initiate was presented with the elixir to drink, and forced to consume if they did not do so willingly.

If the initiate failed to impress or lost their nerve, then there was no risk of them escaping and betraying the church, as they would shortly die anyway of what would seem to be an alcohol-related illness.

==Effects==
In the short term, ingesting the mixture of poison and strong alcohol caused disorientation and general confusion, making the victim more suggestible and easier to control. In the long term, the Elixir would have lethal effects for the initiate if it were not purged or neutralized.

==History==
[[Keph Thingoleir]] was forced to drink the Elixir when he joined the [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|temple of Shar]] in [[Yhaunn]] in [[1373 DR]].
