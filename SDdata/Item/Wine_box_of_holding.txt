Wine boxes of holding were a variety of bags of holding created and enchanted to be used for wine bottles exclusively.
Wine boxes of holding were beautifully decorated oaken containers. Their wooden surfaces were a work of art, being lovingly carved with images of plant life, leaves, and grapevines.
When opened, a wine box of holding appeared to only have space to hold a single bottle of wine however, upon closer examination, it was obvious that its enchantments allowed for six bottles. Only one bottle was visible in the box, and once it was removed, the next stored bottle took its place.

His extradimensional box contained more treasures an enchanted bottle of the healer and a rare crystal bottle of elverquisst bottled the ancient Myth Drannor. The maedar offered the box and its contents to the adventurers who helped him work out a deal between his winery and its rightful owner, Shauna Morden of Ravens Bluff.
