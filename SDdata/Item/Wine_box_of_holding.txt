'''''Wine boxes of holding''''' were a variety of ''[[bags of holding]]'' created and [[enchanted]] to be used for [[wine]] bottles exclusively.

==Description==
''Wine boxes of holding'' were beautifully decorated [[oak]]en containers. Their wooden surfaces were a work of art, being lovingly carved with images of plant life, leaves, and [[grape]]vines.

==Powers==
When opened, a ''wine box of holding'' appeared to only have space to hold a single bottle of wine; however, upon closer examination, it was obvious that its enchantments allowed for six bottles. Only one bottle was visible in the box, and once it was removed, the next stored bottle took its place.

==History==
''Circa'' {{Yearlink|1370}}, a precious ''wine box of holding'' belonged to the [[maedar]] winemaker [[Vorlon]], who ran the [[Morden Winery]] located in a valley outside the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] in [[the Vast]]. His extradimensional box contained more treasures: an enchanted ''[[bottle of the healer]]'' and a rare [[crystal]] bottle of [[elverquisst]] bottled the ancient [[Myth Drannor]]. The maedar offered the box and its contents to the adventurers who helped him work out a deal between his winery and its rightful owner, [[Shauna Morden]] of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|18}}
