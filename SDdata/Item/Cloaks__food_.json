        "mainbody": "loaks were one of the specialty side dishes served at the ramshackle Owlroost Head Inn of the Amnian town of Purskul as of the late 14 century DR.\nCloaks were several side dishes served at the Owlroost Head Inn by themselves or as a main entr√©e. To create the first type of cloaks, one needed to cook, chop, and mash potatos, then shape them and fry until crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, all while flavoring them with lemon, flower buds, and rosemary. Another option were squid-stuffed yams. The squid was boiled in lime juice and the plate was then decorated with lemon spices and crushed mint. Lastly, a portion of fried bones salad was considered to be one of the inns cloaks."
