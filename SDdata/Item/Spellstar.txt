'''''Spellstars''''' were [[gems]] or metal star-shapes within which were stored [[spells]]. By touching a ''spellstar'' and whispering its [[command word]], their users could release the spells kept inside.

==Description==
''Spellstars'' themselves came in two varieties: those made of gemstone and those made of metal. The two were identical in function, simply different in appearance and cost. A ''spellstar'' made from a gem was flawless and glassy, of either blue or green color, and primarily made using a [[sapphire]] or an [[emerald]], respectively. The gems used in this process had to be worth at least 6,000 [[gp]]. Conversely, a metal ''spellstar'' had to be made from purified [[steel]] and have a star-like shape. This steel must also be ''[[everbright]]'', protecting the ''spellstar'' from oxidation and tarnishing.

As each spell within a ''spellstar'' was used, the ''spellstar'' would itself begin to shrink, melting away until, when the last one was released, it crumbled into an unrecoverable dust. The only way to recharge them was through the use of esoteric spells, and it was believed only three individuals knew the spells necessary: [[Alustriel Silverhand]], the High Lady of Silverymoon; [[Syluné]], the Witch of [[Shadowdale]]; and [[Elminster]], the Sage of Shadowdale.

==Powers==
A ''spellstar'' served as a spell repository, holding a maximum of four within it. These were of either arcane or [[divine magic|divine]] sources, but not both, and, if being sold, the number of spells contained within each gem or starshape also affected their price. Each spell stored had a unique [[command word]] assigned to it, which, if spoken while in contact with the ''spellstar'', then unleashed it. In the moment of casting, the ''spellstar'' mentally passed onto the activator all of the spell's details, which then allowed the user to direct the magic as if they were casting it themselves. These spells, however, all functioned using the power and ability of the one who stored them in the ''spellstar'' initially.    

==Notable Owners==
* The [[Tall Ones]], Alustriel's twelve sons and [[pegasi]]-riding agents.
