        "mainbody": "Askata was a strong easily crumbled yellow cheese from Impiltur.\nAskata was crumbly and had a strong taste. It was created by blending goat and cow milk with addition of a certain type of moss that was later removed from the liquid before fermentation started. The resulting cheese melted smoothly and had a noticeable cheddar taste with an added flavor of roasted almonds that became stronger with age.\nIt was commonly served at the Swords Meet in Voonlar accompanying venison meat and mushrooms cooked in red wine. Human nobles considered askata cooked in wine to be \"wonderful\", while some of the hin tasters thought the dish to be \"vomitous.\""
