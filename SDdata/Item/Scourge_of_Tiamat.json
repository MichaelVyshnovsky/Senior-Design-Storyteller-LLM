        "mainbody": "A '''''scourge of Tiamat''''' was, much like a ''[[scourge of fangs]]'', a [[scourge]] with [[snake]]s in place of normal cords.",
        "Description": "The snakes that made up the scourge's cords were all [[viper]]s, a size smaller than the wielder a copy was designed for.",
        "Powers": "A ''scourge of Tiamat'' was functionally fairly similarly to a ''scourge of fangs.'' One notable difference was that its vipers could spit out [[Corrosive (weapon quality)|corrosive]] venom from up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}, affecting a target with both [[poison]] and [[acid]].",
        "History": "These weapons dated back to the height of the [[sarrukh]] empire of [[Okoth]]. Most copies of these weapons that existed by [[1373 DR]] were ones recovered from that empire's scattered ruins.",
        "Notable Owners": {
            "Groups": "These weapons were typically favored in [[Unthalass]] by the [[Dark Scaled Ones]], high-[[priest]]s of [[Tiamat]]."
