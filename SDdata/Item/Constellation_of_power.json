        "mainbody": "The constellation of power was a collection of hovering enchanted metal orbs. It could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nThese golden spheres orbited each other, and was meant to represent the movement of stars. The creator of the constellation of power, a gnome clockwork artist and wild magic sorcerer named Coriolis Rillevay, made them to serve as a constant reminder of her lifelong aspiration to travel to the stars in the night sky above her native Waterdeep.\nIn battle, Coriolis could direct the orbs to fly toward and bombard a target, at which point the unpredictable objects might begin to lash out at other targets randomly.\n* Coriolis Rillevay, who worked as an adventurer on behalf of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, during the late 15 century DR."
