'''''Abdel's trusted shield''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[shield]] that was once wielded by [[Abdel Adrian]], the [[Bhaalspawn]] hero of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
''Abdel's trusted shield'' lacked decorative features, instead being a sturdy simple-looking shield. A note faded with time was attached to the shield. It read: "G, I've found the best defense against an [[arrow]] is to be the one behind the [[bow]] â€“ but this shield also does the trick in a pinch. Yours, AA."

==Powers==
The shield possessed a simple ''+2'' defensive enchantment and was designed to be effective when bashing enemies with it, knocking them prone. Additionally, the shield held the ''[[protection from missiles]]'' [[spell]] that the wielder could cast once per day.

==History==
At some point, Abdel gave this shield to his friend [[Golbraith Stredivas]], an [[adventurer]] who resided in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

During the [[Absolute crisis]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Golbraith may have granted the shield to the [[Absolute Adversaries]] if he was impressed by their courage in fighting against [[mind flayer]]s.
