The '''''ring of equilibrium''''' was a unique [[elf|elven]] [[enchanted]] [[ring]] from ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The ''ring of equilibrium'' appeared to be a simple inconspicuous band of metal.

==Powers==
This ring pressed enchantments that increased the wearer's dexterity and reflexes at the coast of their physical strength. Additionally, it allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[cat's grace]]'' spells at will, however the ring only possessed six charges of it.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the ''ring of equilibrium'' could be found among treasures of a greedy [[dark naga]] who dwelt within an arcane library of the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. Along with other treasures, the ring was scavenged from the ancient elven graves.
