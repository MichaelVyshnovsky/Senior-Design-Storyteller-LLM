'''Jasper''' was a semi-precious form of [[wikipedia:en:quartz|quartz]] or [[chalcedony]] found in the Realms.

==Description==
Mostly found in opaque shades of red, brown, or solid black, very rare specimens of these [[semi-precious stones]] were blue or had bands of blue superimposed over the other colors. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.

==Powers==
Jasper had strong anti-[[poison]] properties. Crushed to powder, it could be substituted for any solid ingredient when making antidotes or magical [[potion]]s and items that neutralized poison or bestowed protection from poison. Because of its reputation and properties, jasper was the stone of choice for making both [[periapt of foul rotting|periapts of foul rotting]] and [[periapt of proof against poison|proof against poison]].

If stored for at least 24 hours in a container made from jasper, consumable liquids were purified of all taint. This was standard practice in the royal palace in [[Suzail]] and many other courts.

==Reputation==
Jasper was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station.

The lesser deity [[Vhaeraun]] was known to occasionally send black-hued jaspers to show his favour or disfavour to his followers.
