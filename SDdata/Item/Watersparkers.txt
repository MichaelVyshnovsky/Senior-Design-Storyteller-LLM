The '''''Watersparkers''''' were a unique set [[boot]]s crafted by the electrifying arcane inventor [[Yrre|Yrre the Sparkstruck]].

==Powers==
Whenever the wearer of the ''Watersparkers'' stepped in a pool of water, that pool became electrified. As they stood on that surface, their body would then conduct electricity for a short time.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the boots remained stashed away in a chest within the [[Shattered Sanctum]].
