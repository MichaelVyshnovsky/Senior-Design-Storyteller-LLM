The '''''Amulet of the Devout''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] that once belonged to [[Otto (Greyhawk)|Otto]] of the [[Circle of Eight]], from the world of [[Oerth]].

==Powers==
The ''Amulet of the Devout'' increased the wearer's protection and resistance against [[spell]]s and granted them an additinal opportunity to ''[[channel divinity]].''

==History==
Sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Amulet of the Devout'' belonged to the [[mage]] Otto from Oerth who had a certain fondness for magical jewelry. By some means, possibly left as an offering, the ''Amulet of the Devout'' ended up stored in the trapped and secured vault underneath the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]], a non-denominational shrine in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. If anyone was daring or foolish enough to rob the temple and steak Otto's amulet, they were castigated by the divinities of the [[Realms]], sending [[deva]]s and [[cambion]]s to end their lives.
