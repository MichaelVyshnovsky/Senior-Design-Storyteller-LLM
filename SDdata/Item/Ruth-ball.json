        "mainbody": "Ruth-balls were a type of deep-fried handfoods made out of seasoned ground chickpeas. The uncooked and unshaped mixture was referred to simply as ruth ().\nRuth-balls were common across the Realms. Volothamp Geddarm savored the best ruth-balls on the island of Tashalar and in the city of Sammaresh of Lapaliiya. Ruth-balls served in Waterdeep, Westgate, and Selgaunt were also of surprising quality. Apparently, this opinion was somewhat controversial."
