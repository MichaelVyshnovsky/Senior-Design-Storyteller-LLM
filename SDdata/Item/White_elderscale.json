        "mainbody": "hite elderscale was a unique set of enchanted heavy armor used in the 15 century DR.\nThis ancient set of armor was crafted using scales of an ancient white dragon. Even damaged, it offered potent protection to the wearer. At its full strength, white elderscale possessed a powerful +4 enchantment and fully mimicked a white dragons resistance to cold, as well as magical regeneration. It also slightly increased the wearers fortitude.\nIn the late 15 century DR, a set of damaged white elderscale was recovered from the dragons roost in the Sword Mountains after a large white dragon was witnessed raiding the lands outside the mines of Phandalin. Despite the wyrm only feeding on beasts of burden and farm animals, Lord Never placed a proactive bounty on the creatures head."
