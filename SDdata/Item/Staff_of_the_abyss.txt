A '''''staff of the abyss''''' was a powerful [[magic]]al [[staff]].

==Description==
A ''staff of the abyss'' was made of leather-like horn. The staff was ornately carved with black runes and with images of tentacled fanged monsters and had a many-horned skull with interlocking fangs on the top of the staff.

On activation of any of the staff's abilities, the skull's eye sockets lighted up with amber flames for five minutes.

==Powers==
A ''staff of the abyss'' could not be used by good people. When a good person tried to use it, the person was harmed by the staff and the damage caused by it could only be healed by non-magical means.

The staff could be used as a melee weapon. A unique aspect of the staff was that the damage caused by it could only be healed by natural means. No kind of magical healing could be applied to make the process faster.

The staff's user could cause fear like a ''[[fear]]'' [[spell]] in a creature the staff touched. If the user managed to concentrate on it, the user could touch a creature by beating it with the staff and dealing the above kind of damage while at the same time infusing the hit creature with the ''fear'' effect.

The staff's user could summon a [[vrock]]. This vrock was under the control of the user until it disappeared after ten minutes. The [[demon]]s this vrock summoned, which was the first thing the vulture-demon did, were not under the user's control but under the summoned vrock's. If the summoned vrock was killed within the aforementioned ten minutes, the caster was absorbed into the ''staff of the abyss'' to serve as the next vrock.

The staff's user could change shape into a [[glabrezu]] for five minutes and could be ended at any point even without the staff. The transformation had curative effects on the user. While the defensive abilities of a glabrezu could be used in the first minute, a glabrezu's offensive capabilities were only accessible from the second minute and onwards. The user gained all abilities of a glabrezu except the ability to cast ''[[plane shift]]'' and the ability to summon additional demons for help.

==History==
The ''staff of the abyss'' was associated with the [[drow]].
