            "Culinary": "Milk could be consumed as it is, or made into several other products. There were several milks that were drunk raw, including that from [[goat]]s,  [[catoblepas]], [[yak]]s, [[sheep]], [[horse]]s, [[cow]]s, [[krotter]]{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} and [[caribou]]. [[Chimera]]s also produced milk, but it was thick and black, and was used as an intoxicant, especially by [[orc]]s. Some trees, such as [[cherry tree]]s, produced milk.\n\nMany milks were used to make [[cheese]]. [[Death Cheese]] was made from catoblepas' milk, [[Damarite Red]] was made from goats' milk, [[Orthin (milk)|Orthin]] was made from milk of both goats and sheep, and [[Elturian Grey]] was made from cows' milk. \n\nIt was sometimes added to [[tea]], along with [[sugar]]. Milk was fermented and used to make [[kumiss]]{{cite book/Arabian Adventures|93}} both alcoholic beverages. Milk was also used in the dish [[kinche]].\n\nCow milk was a common and one of the cheaper drinks one could purchase in inns and taverns, including the [[Lonesome Tankard]] of [[Eveningstar]]. It was believed that a [[tankard]] of warm milk was a cure for stomachache and insomnia.",
            "Other": "Infamous pirate captain from the [[Utter East]], active ''circa'' late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Orim Redbeard]] of the ''[[Black Dragon (ship)|Black Dragon]]'', used a potent mixture of milk and rust to [[dye]] his white beard red, the secret he was ready to kill for.",
            "Spellcasting": "Fat of milk was required when casting the ''[[fumble]]'' [[spell]], and a single drop of milk could be used as the [[material component]] in the ''[[death's door]]'' spell.",
            "Religion": "Followers of [[Selûne]] believed milk to be sacred and thus it was used in many ceremonies. On a full moon, these followers would often set bowls of milk outside. \n\n[[Hathor]] could produce plentiful milk for large groups, and used it as a sign to communicate with her faithful.\n\nThe [[divine realm]] of [[Indra (deity)|Indra]] of the [[Lords of Creation]], located primarily in the shared realm of [[Swarga]] in the [[Indra (layer)|fourth layer]] of [[Limbo]], was an enormous marble sphere filled halfway with a sea of magically enchanted milk. Indra's castle was located on a turtle-shaped island that floated at the center of the sea."
