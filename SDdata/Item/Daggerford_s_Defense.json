        "mainbody": "Daggerfords Defense were magical chainmails created in celebration of Edwin Daggerfords defeat of the devil Gorgomorz circa 1270 DR.\nThese sets of armor were enchanted to provide additional defense against creatures from outside of the Prime Material plane and to increase the wearers resistance to fear, both magical and mundane.\nDaggerford has had a tumultuous history when it came to the devils from the Dragonspear Castle. These sets of chainmail armor, alongside with a few other items, were created to effectively combat any extra-planar threats that menaced Daggerford. In 1372 DR Daggerfords Defense could be purchased from Dervals Bright Blade blacksmith shop of Derval Ironeaters."
