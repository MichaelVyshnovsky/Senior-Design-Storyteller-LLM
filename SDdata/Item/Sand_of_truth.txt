Sand of truth was a magical item that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. They were only carried or used by holy slayers.
This magical dust was created from the remains of a slain sandman.
Sand of truth could reveal illusions, genie-work, and polymorphed creatures. In essence, it revealed the true nature of any magically altered item or creature. When sprinkled onto such an object or creature, the sand would transform the subject back to its original state.
