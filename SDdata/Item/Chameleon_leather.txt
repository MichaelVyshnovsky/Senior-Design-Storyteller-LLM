'''Chameleon leather''' armor was a type of armor used on [[Toril]].

==Description==
The name "chameleon leather" was a misnomer, as it was actually made from the treated hide of an [[ophidian]], not the skin of a [[chameleon]]. The breastplate and shoulders of the armor were stiffened by boiling in oil. The rest of the armor remained tough, but flexible. The armor did maintain a fraction of the color-changing abilities that the ophidian once possessed. Chamelon leather could only be crafted by a master leatherworker.

==Usage==
Chameleon armor was only commonly found in communities near the [[Serpent Hills]]. Any serpentfolk who encountered non-serpentfolk wearing chameleon leather would treat the wearers with disdain or hostility.
