        "mainbody": "'''''Potions of true seeing''''' were enchanted [[potion]]s that granted the imbiber with temporary gift of ''[[true sight]]''.",
        "Description": "These potions were often bottled in [[glass]] [[decanter]]s, decorated with filigree.",
        "Powers": "Consumption of a ''potion of true seeing'' was similar to a powerful [[wizard]] casting the spell of ''true seeing'' on the imbiber. While the potion's effects were active, the drinker could freely see in normal and magical ''[[darkness]]'', see through ''[[illusion]]s'' and ''[[invisibility]]'', not be deterred by ''[[mirror image]]'' spell, and could see things and creatures displaced from the [[Prime Material plane]] to the [[Ethereal plane]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], several of these potions could be recovered from the ruins of grand city of [[Myth Drannor]]. These potions were used by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] who occupied the ruins in 1369 DR, as well as their [[drow]] allies from the noble [[House Freth]]."
