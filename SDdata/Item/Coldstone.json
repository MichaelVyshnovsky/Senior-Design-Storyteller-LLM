        "mainbody": "Coldstone was a type of mineral, imbued with frost and magical cold.\nColdstones resembled small blue crystals. When used for crafting, they were broken into  pieces.\nWhen a coldstone was broken or crushed, it produced numbing cold. Because of that, coldstones were often used to produce traps that dealt magical cold damage when activated. Weak traps required only one crystal, medium-powered traps - three crystals, powerful traps - five, and lastly, seven coldstones in a trap could trigger to produce a deadly wave of frost that was likely to kill the unwitting creature.\nIn the late 14 century DR, coldstones were fairly common  across the many civilized settlements across the Sword Coast, and the rest of Faer√ªn, especially in the towns with thieves guilds. Places like Luskan, Neverwinter had coldstones in raw in within pre-made traps available for purchase."
