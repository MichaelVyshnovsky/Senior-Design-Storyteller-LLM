        "mainbody": "'''''Coldstone''''' was a type of mineral, imbued with frost and magical cold.",
        "Description": "Coldstones resembled small blue crystals. When used for crafting, they were broken into {{SI|0.3|lb|k|long=yes}} pieces.",
        "Powers": "When a ''coldstone'' was broken or crushed, it produced numbing cold. Because of that, ''coldstones'' were often used to produce traps that dealt magical cold damage when activated. Weak traps required only one crystal, medium-powered traps - three crystals, powerful traps - five, and lastly, seven ''coldstones'' in a trap could trigger to produce a deadly wave of frost that was likely to kill the unwitting creature.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''coldstones'' were fairly common  across the many civilized settlements across the [[Sword Coast]], and the rest of [[Faerûn]], especially in the towns with thieves' guilds. Places like [[Luskan]], [[Neverwinter]] had ''coldstones'' in raw in within pre-made traps available for purchase."
