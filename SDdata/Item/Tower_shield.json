        "mainbody": "'''Tower shields''', also known as '''body shields''' or '''large shields''', were a large-sized style of [[shield]] in the Realms that were sometimes conflated with [[kite shield]]s.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"kite\">Some sources, such as the [[Baldur's Gate series]] and [[Icewind Dale series]], refer to [[kite shield]] as being another name for tower shields. Other sources, such as [[Player's Option: Combat & Tactics]], contradict this claim.
