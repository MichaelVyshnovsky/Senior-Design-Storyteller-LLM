A '''''belt of giant strength''''', or a '''''girdle of giant strength''''', was a [[magic]] [[belt (clothing)|belt]] that imbued the wearer with greater strength, like that of a [[giant]].

==Description==
Generally, there were several types of ''belts of giant strength'', each corresponding to a type of giant. The more powerful the belt, the rarer it was. In order of power, they were:
* ''[[Belt of hill giant strength]]''
* ''[[Belt of stone giant strength]]'', ''[[belt of frost giant strength]]''<ref group="note">Prior to [[1371 DR]], the ''belt of frost giant strength'' was superior to the ''belt of stone giant strength''. However, following the [[Second Sundering]], they were of the same power. See the History section for more information.
* ''[[Belt of fire giant strength]]''
* ''[[Belt of cloud giant strength]]''
* ''[[Belt of storm giant strength]]''

However, in some time periods, the number of belt types were reduced, and were just known as ''belts of giant strength''.

==Powers==
When donned, the wearer became much physically stronger (unless they were already somehow more powerful than a giant or had other specific sources of strength enhancement), but would remain the same size. As such, they would deal more damage with physical attacks, smash open doors more easily, carry more weight, and hurl (heavier) rocks further. They could also have a higher chance to hit foes, as well as pry open bars or lift gates.

The additional physical power bestowed open the wearer did not accumulate with other sources of magical strength. However, there were exceptions, such as when a pair of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' or magic [[warhammer]]s like the ''[[Hammer of Thunderbolts]]'', were equipped alongside the belts.

==History==
These magical items drastically changed throughout the history of [[Faer√ªn]] and beyond, from their names to their powers.

===Prior to 1371 DR===
[[File:BeltGiantStrength.png|250px|right|thumb|A ''belt of giant strength'' before 1371 DR.]]
Prior to [[1371 DR]], they were known as ''girdles'' instead of belts, and looked very similar to ordinary belts. In these times, there were six distinct types, each representing the six types of giant. ''Belts of frost giant strength'' were more powerful than ''belts of stone giant strength''. These girdles could only be worn by [[cleric]]s, [[fighter]]s, and [[thieves]]. They had a sale value of approximately 2,500 [[gp]].

===1371 DR to the Spellplague===
After 1371 DR, and up to the [[Spellplague]], these items became known as ''belts'' of giant strength. The belts themselves also became generic in both power and name. The belts no longer scaled with respect to the strength of the giant, instead providing an enhancement to the wearer strength; they became known as only ''belts of giant strength'', i.e., the giant type was not included. There appeared to be two main types of belt during this period: ''belts of giant strength +4'' and ''belts of giant strength +6''. They appeared as broad leather belts that were studded with iron, and could be made by very skilled crafters, as long as they knew the ''[[bull's strength]]'' [[spell]]. The lesser version sold for about 16,000 [[gp]], whilst the greater version sold for 36,000 [[gp]].

===The Spellplague to the Second Sundering===
After the devastation of the [[Spellplague]], these belts appeared to greatly decrease in power, and became even more generic. Similarly to the previous time period, they slotted around the waist, and were made of rough leather that was studded with chunks of stone. However, instead of having multiples varieties, there was just one, which had a price of approximately 25,000 [[gp]].

Instead of increasing the wearer's strength in all activities, they only made the wearer slightly stronger in some of their abilities and provided increased damage. They did not allow the wearer to have an increased chance of hitting the foe, or improve other combat skills. Only once per day, the belts allowed the wearers to make a more powerful attack.

===After the Second Sundering===
Following the [[Second Sundering]], these belts reverted to their unique giant types, but were still known as belts instead of girdles. As prior to 1371 DR, there were six types, but two functioned the same: the ''stone'' and ''frost'' giant varieties (as these giants has the same strength in this era). These two belts provided the same strength, but looked different. All the belts had different designs.

==Variants==
