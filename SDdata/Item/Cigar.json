        "mainbody": "igars were rolls made from Nexalan tabacco leaves, which could be smoked similarly to pipeweed.\nThe way cigars were made from rolling entire tabacco leaves was impossible to reproduce using pipeweed. The scent from smoking cigars was also richer and more pungent, and was said to provide great pleasure.\nThey were available for sale through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nCigars were popular among travelers returning from Maztica."
