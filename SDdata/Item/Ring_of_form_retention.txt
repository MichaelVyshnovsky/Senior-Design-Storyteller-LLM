A '''''ring of form retention''''' was a [[magical]] [[ring]] that helped maintain shapechanging effects.

==Description==
The ring took the form of an innocuous silver band, to better avoid detection.

==Powers==
The ''ring of form retention'' ensured that a shapechanging effect — whether from a [[wizard]]'s spell or a shapechanger's innate ability — remained uninterrupted and intact through circumstances that could negatively affect it. Thus, it was highly prized by those who used magical disguises. The ring was powerful enough to maintain the changed form of a dead [[doppelganger]], which would normally revert to their natural form immediately on death.

==Notable Owners==
A ''ring of form retention'' was held by the wizard [[Kalris]], who often used trickery and misdirection in his work. While plotting to kidnap Lord [[Partic Thistle]], he gave his ring to the [[doppelganger]] [[Xixis]], who was to impersonate the Lord. When Xixis was killed, the ring allowed his body to maintain the impersonation.
