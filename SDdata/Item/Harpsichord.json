        "Description": "Harpsichords were popular in manors and castles alike. They were versatile instruments that could be played by one or two players and could provide a variety of moods, from cheerful to pensive.\n\nHarpsichords crafted by a [[gnome|gnomish]] master from [[Selgaunt]] could be special-ordered through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. Prices varied depending on materials, so each order was individualized.",
