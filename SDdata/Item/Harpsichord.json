        "mainbody": "A harpsichord was a large keyboard instrument.\nHarpsichords were popular in manors and castles alike. They were versatile instruments that could be played by one or two players and could provide a variety of moods, from cheerful to pensive.\nHarpsichords crafted by a gnomish master from Selgaunt could be special-ordered through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. Prices varied depending on materials, so each order was individualized.\n* The Bendekars Mercantile storehouse in Ravens Bluff had a harpsichord in their instruments collection."
