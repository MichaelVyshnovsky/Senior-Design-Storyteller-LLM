'''''Hoarfrost boots''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] footwear that made the wearer surefooted in the frozen regions of the [[Realms]].

==Powers==
Unassuming yet hardy in appearance, ''hoarfrost boots'' were enchanted in a way that a collection of small ice crystals on the boots' soles functioned like cleats. This magic allowed the wearer to remain upright even on the slipperiest of ice winter surfaces at all times.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''hoarfrost boots'' belonged to the Inquisitor [[W'wargaz]] of [[Cr√®che Y'llek]]. The boots were stored in W'wargaz's quarters in the ruined Rosymorn Monastery.
