        "mainbody": "'''''Skunk shot''''' was a type of [[mage shot]] that consisted of a large stone filled with foul-smelling liquid.\n\nWhen this projectile was shot from a siege weapon, the stone would shatter and release its contents. When the fluid was exposed to air, such as within a [[spelljammer]]'s air envelope, it would rapidly evaporate into a toxic green cloud, as per the [[spell]] ''[[stinking cloud]]''. This vapor affected anyone within its radius in a similar manner to the spell."
