A '''broadsword''', or a '''broad sword''', was a medium-sized [[sword]] used for slashing.

==Description==
The definition of what a broadsword was often differed depending on the culture they were used in. However, broadswords were specifically used to slash, unlike [[longsword]]s, which were used to both slash and pierce. Most of these swords had extra protection around their hilts. 

Broadswords were roughly the same length as standard swords, but most had basket hilts More specifically, broadswords were heavy, had double-edged blades, and were around {{SI|3.5|ft|long=yes}} long. The metal hilts of such swords could be used similarly to metal [[gauntlets]]. Thus, they were favored by those who were skilled in hand-to-hand combat, as well as those who utilized parrying.

==Notable Broadswords==
* ''[[Albruin]]'', an intelligent [[chaotic]] broadsword made of [[steel]]-[[electrum]]-[[silver]] alloy.
* ''[[Tempusfugue]]'', an intelligent ''+1'' broadsword owned by [[Baergon Bluesword]].
