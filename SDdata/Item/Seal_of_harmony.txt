The '''''seal of harmony''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] token crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Jarlaxle]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Powers==
In battle, the ''seal of harmony'' served to protect Raika from harm by reflecting incoming attacks back at her foes. Outside of battle, it would pulse steadily to remind Raika to stay on her path and maintain balance in her mission as she transitioned back-and-forth between civilization and the wilderness.

==Notable Owners==
* Raika, a [[half-orc]] [[barbarian]] for whom Silverhand also crafted the ''[[maul of focused destruction]]'', the ''[[Great Wolf's Mark]]'', and the ''[[Great Wolf's Fury]]''.
