        "mainbody": "Xamars baldric was a unique, cursed baldric that could be found in the land of Calimshan.\nThis baldric was constructed of leather, tanned from the hide of a black dragon and cured in a spiders venom.\nOnce equipped, this baldric fused itself with its wearer and became like a black-scale tattoo across their chest. Once bound, they instilled in their wearer an immunity to poison, slightly enhanced strength, poisonous claws, and the ability to cast spider climb at will.\nIn around two to twelve years, those who donned this baldric would transform into a giant spider. Once this transformation was complete, the baldric would return to its material state. Removing this curse was rather difficult, requiring at least the use of a limited wish spell.\nThe transformation into a giant spider was largely unknown to the masses of Calimshan, with the legends surrounding it merely saying that whoever wore it tended to mysteriously disappear after about ten years of doing so.\nThis baldric was constructed by a mage under the duress of an avaricious Calishite thief named Xamar. Over the course of a decade he built up a reputation for himself and his baldric, he finally fell victim to its curse and transformed into a giant spider."
