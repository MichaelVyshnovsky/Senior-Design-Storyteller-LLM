Boots of grace were enchanted boots that improved the wearers movement making it graceful like that of a cat.
Boots of grace were made out of soft leather.
These soft enchanted boots improved the wearers dexterity and reflexes and allowed the spell of cats grace to be cast at a low level.
In 1369 DR a pair of the boots of grace found its way to one of the overseers of the Cult of the Dragon that occupied the ruins of Myth Drannor. The unnamed overseer was supervising the operations of the cult deep in the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor and allied themselves with drow of House Freth.
