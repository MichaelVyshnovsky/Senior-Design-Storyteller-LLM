'''''Boots of grace''''' were enchanted boots that improved the wearer's movement making it graceful like that of a [[cat]].

==Description==
''Boots of grace'' were made out of soft leather.

==Powers==
These soft enchanted boots improved the wearer's dexterity and reflexes and allowed the spell of ''[[cat's grace]] to be cast at a low level.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]] a pair of the ''boots of grace'' found its way to one of the overseers of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that occupied the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. The unnamed overseer was supervising the operations of the cult deep in the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] and allied themselves with [[drow]] of [[House Freth]].
