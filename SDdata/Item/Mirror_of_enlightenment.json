        "mainbody": "'''''Mirrors of enlightenment''''' were a variety of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[mirror]] from the land of [[Kara-Tur]] that allowed one to discern the inner nature of other creatures.",
        "Description": "These mirrors were round in shape and had a rather ordinary appearance.",
        "Powers": "Whenever the [[command word]] of a ''mirror of enlightenment'' was spoken, the reflection of a creature in front of it would become surrounded by a colored aura. This aura was only visible to the one who spoke the command word and it revealed the nature of the reflected creature. This effect was similar to the [[spell]]s ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect motivation]]'', and ''[[know alignment]]''.\n\nOnly one creature could be reflected and studied within the mirror per minute.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Akanu Kiku]]<ref>\n* [[Kolyn Sundancer]] kept a full-length ''mirror of enlightenment'' within his room in the [[Far Guardians' Traveler's Mission]].\n* [[Osari Daizan]]<ref>\n* [[Roscoe Carter]]"
