        "mainbody": "'''''Ever Watchful''''', later known as '''''Vindicator''''', was the favored weapon of [[Helm]], the [[deity]] of guardians and protectors.{{cite book/Faiths and Pantheons|28}}",
        "Description": "''Ever Watchful'' was a mighty [[bastard sword]] that Helm preferred to wield two-handed. The sword had the symbol of Helm (a watchful eye with a blue pupil emblazoned on an upright [[gauntlet]]) on its hilt. It glowed with silvery flame, and anyone unworthy of wielding it felt a burning sensation when they grasped it.",
        "Powers": "In the hands of Helm's [[avatar]], the weapon was an incredibly powerful ''[[keen]]'' bastard sword that was both ''[[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]]'' and ''[[lawful]]''. It therefore struck hardest against [[evil]] and [[chaotic]] foes, and such creatures would be weakened should they touch the sword.{{cite book/Faiths and Pantheons|30}}<ref group=\"note\">''Ever Watchful'' was a ''+4 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]] [[keen]] [[lawful]] bastard sword'' in ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'', and was given as a ''+3 bastard sword'' in the earlier ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]''. It had no formal statistics in [[4th edition]].\n\nAmong mortals who were deemed worthy to wield it, ''Ever Watchful'' could be recalled to their hands regardless of where it was.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice}} These individuals also had the ability to wreathe themselves in an [[Armor of faith (spell)|''armor of faith'']] that manifested as luminous grey [[plate mail]]. The grey color of both the armor and the sword's flames were said to represent the [[lawful neutral]] ideology of Helm's justice: neither evil (black) nor good (white).",
        "History": "While Helm had wielded many weapons, ''Ever Watchful'' was his preference.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, Helm was [[Helm#Death|killed]] in an honor-duel with [[Tyr]]. His sword, now more often referred to as \"''Vindicator'',\" arrived on [[Faer√ªn]] that same year in the hands of [[Gedrin Thalavar|Gedrin Thalvar]] after he had a vision of the god's death. Gedrin would go on to wield the blade in the name of justice as a vigilante called \"Shadowbane.\"\n\nMany years later, Gedrin gave the sword to [[Kalen Dren]], who took up Gedrin's Shadowbane mantle and carried the sword{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|548}}{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|5297}}",
        "Reputation": "[[File:Shadowbane Hi-res.jpg|thumb|195px|Shadowbane wielding ''Vindicator'', aka ''Ever Watchful''.]]\nAs the calling card of the holy vigilante Shadowbane, ''Ever Watchful'' (known as ''Vindicator'') was an object of both terror and veneration throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] in both [[Waterdeep]] and [[Westgate]].",
