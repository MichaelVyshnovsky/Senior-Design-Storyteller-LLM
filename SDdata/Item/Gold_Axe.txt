The Gold Axe was a money-generating enchanted greataxe.
The Gold Axe had a very handy enchantment that magically created gold when it killed.
The true origins of the Gold Axe remained unknown. It first appeared when a traveling merchant made a trade with a blacksmith named Padron. The merchant convinced the smith to exchange the Gold Axe, the magic axe that was to bring more money than Padron could ever imagine, for the smiths home. Padron unsuccessfully tried to sell the axe to make the promised money. Desperate and angry, the blacksmith murdered the trader with the Gold Axe. As the merchant died, his pockets started overfilling with gold. Padron kept the gold and gotten rid of the murder weapon.
