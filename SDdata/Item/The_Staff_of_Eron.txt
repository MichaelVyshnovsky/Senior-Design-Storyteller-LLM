'''''The Staff of Eron''''' was a mundane in appearance yet powerful [[enchanted]] [[staff]] that once was wielded by [[Eron the Dismayed]] sometime before [[1281 DR]].

==Powers==
The weapon possessed a potent ''+3'' [[enchantment]].

==History==
The ''The Staff of Eron'' was created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. The staff's owner was the [[wizard]] known as Eron the Dismayed, a notoriously pessimistic individual who believed in mastering ''[[the Art]]'' through magical dueling. He traveled the lands looking opponents but he believed that the roads were packed with [[thieves]] and [[assassins]] so Eron always dressed in shabby and inconspicuous robes. The staff he wielded appeared as a simple walking stick but possessed powerful enchantments.

By 1281 DR, ''The Staff of Eron'' found its way into the village of [[Kuldahar]] and the hands of the town's smith â€“ [[Conlan]].
