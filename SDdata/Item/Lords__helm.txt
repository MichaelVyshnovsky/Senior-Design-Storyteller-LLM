A Lords helm was an enchanted bucket helm given to all Lords of Waterdeep and worn only in public with their blank masks. It was one of three pieces of clothing referred to as the Lords ensemble.
A Lords helm acted like a ring of mind shielding, protecting the Lords mind from unwanted intrusion. Additionally, the helm changed the wearers voice to a deep baritone.
