        "mainbody": "Boiled beholder eyestalks was a common and gruesome dish of githyanki cuisine found in gith cr√®ches and the Astral Sea in the late 15 century DR.\nThis straightforward dish was made using beholder eyestalks, severed at the base and boiled whole, skin and eyeballs included. They were served whole, plated on large trays, and garnished with sprigs of parsley and lemon wedges, presumably for drizzling over this gourmet meat."
