The '''''seal of constancy''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] medallion crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Halbenet Soladonel]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The ''seal of constancy'' was nearly weightless, and was meant to serve as a reminder of how devotion to others helps to ease one's own burdens.

==Powers==
When Halbenet engaged in battle alongside friends, the [[magic]] of the ''seal'' rewarded their devotion by preserving and restoring their allies' minds.

==Notable Owners==
* Halbenet Soladonel, an [[Elf|elven]] [[cleric]] of [[Corellon]] for whom Silverhand also crafted the ''[[Caretaker's Crown]]'' and the ''[[sword of bright blinding]]''.
