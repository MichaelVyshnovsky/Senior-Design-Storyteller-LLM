The seal of constancy was a unique enchanted medallion crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Halbenet Soladonel in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
The seal of constancy was nearly weightless, and was meant to serve as a reminder of how devotion to others helps to ease ones own burdens.
When Halbenet engaged in battle alongside friends, the magic of the seal rewarded their devotion by preserving and restoring their allies minds.
* Halbenet Soladonel, an elven cleric of Corellon for whom Silverhand also crafted the Caretakers Crown and the sword of bright blinding.
