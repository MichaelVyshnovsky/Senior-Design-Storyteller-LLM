In some instances, ''soul gems'' were encased within a protective ''[[force sphere]]'' that had to be destroyed before the gem itself could be accessed.

==Powers==
It was possible for the [[spirit]]s of the dead to use a ''soul gem'' to communicate with people on the [[Prime Material plane]], even if their soul had no connection to the gem.

When utilized by undead beings, ''soul gems'' acted similarly to [[phylacteries]]; the gem's destruction would allow the physical form the undead to be permanently destroyed.

==Uses==
