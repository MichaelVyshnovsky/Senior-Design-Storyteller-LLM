'''''Sequencer robes''''' were [[enchanted]] robes that allowed for the storage and use of additional [[spell]]s.

==Description==
These wizardly robes were woven out of thin strips of magical fabric that could store arcane energies. These robes were primarily used to store defensive spells for use at a later date. Unlike casting a regular spell, the stored [[magic]]s were discharged instantaneously. There were stories of more powerful versions of ''sequencer robes'' in existence.
