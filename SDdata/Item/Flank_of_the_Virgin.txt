Flank of the Virgin was a unique enchanted shield made out of the hull of a small Reghedmen boat in the late 13 century DR.
Flank of the Virgin was a large shield painted with a piece of Reghedmen art depicting a sacrificial virgin. The painting itself or possibly the paints imbued an enchantment onto the shields wood. It possessed enhanced protection and improved the wielders dexterity.
In the , Sammel Colger of Bremen came across a shipwreck of a beautifully painted Reghedmen boat in the Sea of Moving Ice. Mesmerized by the colorful art, Sammel broke off a huge chunk of the hull. At that moment, he was attacked by a polar bear. Instinctively, the Bremenner shielded himself from the beast with the broken hull chunk. The improvised shield deflected the beasts attack and, luckily enough, made the bear slip on ice and plummet back under the ice. Sammel Colger jumped onto his own boat and sailed away from the angry beast without hesitation. Subsequently, a cleric of Tempus told Sammel that the image depicted a traditional sacrificial virgin of the Reghedmen. He commissioned the wood to be made into the shield, which Sammel carried with him until the day he died.
By the , Flank of the Virgin was owned by the Gallaway Trade Depot and available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in Targos.
