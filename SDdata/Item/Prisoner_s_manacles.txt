==Powers==
The manacles gave the wearer a certain brutal strength and power, especially when striking with their weighted fists directly.

==History==
The ''prisoner's manacles'' were found by [[Cormyr]]ean forces that overcame [[Rantha]], the gatekeeper officer of General [[Marthir]]. This was part of a greater counterattack at the [[Netherese Recruiting Center]] inside the Wheloon Prison, where prisoners were taken in and turned into soldiers for [[Thultanthar]]'s army.
