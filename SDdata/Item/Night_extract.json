        "mainbody": "Night extract was a magical liquid used by shadow fey to cast an area in darkness.\nNight extract could be brewed by a spellcaster who knew the light spell and the art of crafting wondrous items.\nWhen smashed open, usually by being hurled or dropped, a vial of night extract reduced the ambient light of an area to distance of 20 feet (6.1 meters), to the equivalent illumination of starlight. Mundane illumination was nulled, but magical illumination continued to function, countering the darkness. It also made it harder to spot lurking creatures. The night extract worked for 10 minutes."
