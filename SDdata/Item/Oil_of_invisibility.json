        "Powers": "When smeared on an item or individual, this oil caused the coated surface to completely disappear. This effect last for 1â€“2 hours.\n\nThough anything coated with this oil was invisible to the naked eye, the oil gave off a distinct scent that was easily tracked by most dogs or other creatures with an acute sense of smell.",
