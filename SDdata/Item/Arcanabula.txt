An '''arcanabula''', sometimes known as an ''orizon'', was the term used for a [[wizard]]’s working [[spellbook]]; often a hodgepodge of [[spell]]s (including some that were unusable by the author) and research notes for both the completed spells therein and for spell concepts still in progress. 

An arcanabula differed in concept from a "travelling spellbook" in that the latter was generally a distilled copy of one or more arcanabulae, lacking the research notes for the sake of compactness, though most travelling spellbooks with blank pages remaining almost inevitably became aracanabulae. 

==Description==
Throughout Faerûn, the most common form of arcanabula was the spellbook that every aspiring wizard started his or her career with. This was a well-bound book, approximately 9” × 12” (23 × 30 cm), with leather-covered [[suthwood]] front and back covers protecting fifty leaves of well-crafted parchment suitable for writing on both sides for a total of 100 pages. The whole tome weighed in at three pounds (1.4 kg).<ref>

The cover material varied widely from region to region. Some were cloth or felt covered, some were uncovered, and some used [[linen]] [[paper]] or even [[vellum]] instead of [[parchment]]. Likewise, page counts varied from 25 to 500 pages, though these were commonly purchased and used only after the first one had been filled to capacity. 

Commonly, the front cover and/or spine bore the owner’s [[Mage sigil|sigil]] marked upon it, either visibly or invisibly.

The arcanabulae of an [[illusionist]] was often glamered to look like something else. They were typically nondescript, or resembled something other than a book―a gaming board, for instance.
