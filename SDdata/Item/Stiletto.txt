A stiletto, also known as a stylet, was a slender dagger used for piercing leather and plated armor, and mail such as chain mail.
Stilettos had slim blades that were triangular or square in shape and ended in a sharp point. They were narrow enough to be concealed in sword canes, or even in the handle of a bastard sword.
