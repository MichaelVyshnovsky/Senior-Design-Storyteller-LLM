A '''stiletto''', also known as a '''stylet''', was a slender [[dagger]] used for piercing [[leather armor|leather]] and [[plate mail|plated armor]], and mail such as [[chain mail]].

==Description==
Stilettos had slim blades that were triangular or square in shape and ended in a sharp point. They were narrow enough to be concealed in [[sword cane]]s, or even in the handle of a [[bastard sword]].

==History==
Many cities prohibited the use of stilettos because they could be easily concealed on the body
