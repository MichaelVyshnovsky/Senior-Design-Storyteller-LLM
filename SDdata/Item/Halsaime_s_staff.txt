'''''Halsaime's staff''''' was a magical [[staff]] used by the [[Shadovar]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]], which came to the possession of the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] before being destroyed. Though powerful, the staff had a peculiar influence on the wielder that made it incredibly dangerous.{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
{{Quote
|First [[Jussko Kwahn|that bard]], and now you. I don't know where your [[Oriphaun Huntsilver|precious nobleman]] is. He can't have his staff back, anyway. I've decided to keep it.

The staff was made of a dark wood, and one end curled in on itself into a spiral. It radiated a strong red glow when active.

|He entrusted it to me, young Huntsilver did. Told me to keep it safe. But it called to me. And I saw that the staff was a book, so I opened the book, and oh! What lay inside.

The staff seemed to provide the bearer with great magical power, but at the same time drove them to great violence and paranoia.

==History==
{{Quote
|Within this staff, such power. And so old. So many things whispered here. Things I've only begun to understandâ€¦
|Halsaime
}}
The staff was originally held by a [[Shadovar]] [[arcanist]] that [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]] managed to ambush and kill while traveling between [[Wheloon Prison]] and the [[Storm Horns]]. Oriphaun noted that the staff was extremely powerful and dangerous, and sought to resolve the matter safely. He delivered it to his friend Halsaime, a powerful druid who lived near [[Eveningstar]] at [[Thorngap]], a druidic circle that he was the senior druid of.

Unfortunately, the staff was too much even for Halsaime. It twisted his mind with paranoia and violence even as it empowered him, sending him on a murderous campaign against the people of Eveningstar. He used it to create [[red musk zombie]]s and twist nature to his purpose, subverting and maddening his fellow druids, [[wood woad]]s, and [[dryad]]s in the process. When he was finally tracked down at [[Druid's Deep]] in the [[King's Forest]], Halsaime was killed and the [[Harper]] agent [[Jussko Kwahn]] used a [[scroll]] to destroy the cursed artifact once and for all.
