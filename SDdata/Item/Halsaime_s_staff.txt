Halsaimes staff was a magical staff used by the Shadovar in the mid-1480s DR, which came to the possession of the druid Halsaime before being destroyed. Though powerful, the staff had a peculiar influence on the wielder that made it incredibly dangerous.
The staff was made of a dark wood, and one end curled in on itself into a spiral. It radiated a strong red glow when active.
The staff seemed to provide the bearer with great magical power, but at the same time drove them to great violence and paranoia.
The staff was originally held by a Shadovar arcanist that Oriphaun Huntsilver managed to ambush and kill while traveling between Wheloon Prison and the Storm Horns. Oriphaun noted that the staff was extremely powerful and dangerous, and sought to resolve the matter safely. He delivered it to his friend Halsaime, a powerful druid who lived near Eveningstar at Thorngap, a druidic circle that he was the senior druid of.
Unfortunately, the staff was too much even for Halsaime. It twisted his mind with paranoia and violence even as it empowered him, sending him on a murderous campaign against the people of Eveningstar. He used it to create red musk zombies and twist nature to his purpose, subverting and maddening his fellow druids, wood woads, and dryads in the process. When he was finally tracked down at Druids Deep in the Kings Forest, Halsaime was killed and the Harper agent Jussko Kwahn used a scroll to destroy the cursed artifact once and for all.
