The Belt of Bones was a heavy enchanted belt created by the clergy of the Church of Myrkul some years before the late 13 century DR.
The belt itself was made out of leather, set with metal plates and decorative hoops, all of which held human bones.
Belt of Bones was imbued with magic that allowed the wearer to cast the deadly circle of bones spell and the animate dead spell once per day each.
The original owner of the Belt of Bones was a dangerous warrior named Proud Keth who wore the belt into many battles, where the man massacred everyone in his way. Keth used the belts magic on rare occasions when he was surrounded by enemies. Eventually, Proud Keths enemies learned of his strategies and took him down once a for all using polearms and spears. The Belt of Bones was on Keths body when the warrior was buried. However, how grave was soon desecrated and the magic belt – taken. The thieves ended up selling the Belt of Bones to the mage named Isanan from Urmlaspyr, a city in Sembia. The belt stayed with the wizard for many years until Isanan retired and sold the belt back to the Church of Myrkul and a very grateful cleric – Ben-Karad. Subsequently, Ben-Karad was said to had been killed in the of sewers of Waterdeep.
The belts history was shrouded in mystery after Ben-Karads death. However, in the , the Belt of Bones was believed to had reappeared in Icewind Dale during the conflict between the united Uthgardt and Reghedmen barbarians under the command of lord Wylfdene, in the barbarians camp outside the town of Lonelywood.
