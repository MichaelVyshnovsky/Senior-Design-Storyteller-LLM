        "mainbody": "A '''''brooch of dispelling'''''No formal name is given for the brooch as an item. The name for this article has been chosen by combining the noun with the function, as no brooch of dispelling exists in any known supplement. was a magical brooch which contained powerful dispelling magic. In the {{yearlinkName|976}}, the mage [[Umbeso]] attempted to use such a brooch, made of fine [[silver]] over [[onyx]], which he had acquired from a [[Calishite]] magic dealer many years before, to cancel the magic of the ''[[Evise Jhontil]]''. unsuccessfully; though the backlash did not kill him, it destroyed the brooch."
