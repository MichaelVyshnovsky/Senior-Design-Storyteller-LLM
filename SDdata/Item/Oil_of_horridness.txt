Oil of horridness was a magical substance that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider at the bottom than they were at the top.
When smeared on the face, oil of horridness drastically reduced the attractiveness of an individual, so much so that most people could not stand to be in their presence. This effect lasted for one full day.
A flask containing this oil was never labeled correctly simply because oil of horridness was the end result when oil of attractiveness spoiled.
