A helm of opposite alignment was a cursed helmet, whose dweomer could transform a wearers heart into all they werent.
Most such helms were average metal caps. At least one, however, had been jeweled, while another was silver and made in the shape of a dragons head.
As soon as one wore such a helm, it caused them to flip their behavior, aligning their soul with the opposite aspects that it had been aligned previously. This altered their worldview, inverted their morality, and turned around their ethical outlook. The helm instantly lost all power, but the once-wearer was compelled to view any inversion of their changes with horror, and to relish their new perspective on all matters.
An amulet of protection from alignment change could block their powers. Interestingly, faith incarnates rendered their host immune to helms of opposite alignment.
