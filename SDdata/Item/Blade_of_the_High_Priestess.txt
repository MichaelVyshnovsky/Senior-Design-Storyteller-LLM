The '''''blade of the High Priestess''''' was the sacrificial [[dagger]] of High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]] of [[Sschindylryn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The blade had a curved point and many barbs angled backwards, ensuring that it would tear apart the victim when pulled from a wound.

==Powers==
The dagger bore a number of [[Item enchantment|enchantments]] that improved its ability to inflict gruesome wounds, as well as being able to drain the willpower from and ''[[paralyze]]'' the victim when struck. It also helped channel magical power for the user.

==History==
The High Priestess Hekta carried the blade during the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the [[Darkening]], when she conspired to steal the [[Thread of the Weave]] and gift it to [[Lolth]]. She used the blade to perform countless dark and bloody rituals while she had it, and was eventually defeated at the [[Temple of Lolth (Sschindylryn)|Temple of Lolth]] atop the [[Sschindylryn Ziggurat]].
