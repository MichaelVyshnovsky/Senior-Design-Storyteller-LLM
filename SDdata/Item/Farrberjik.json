        "mainbody": "Farrberjik was an item that could be used to line the inside of boots.\nWhen boots were lined with Farrberjiks, they effectively became magical. These boots allowed the wearer to jump much further than usual, and potentially move faster. Thus, Farrberjiks could be used to transform ordinary boots into boots of striding and leaping.\nIn the 14 century DR, Farrberjik boots could be purchased from Farr Windward."
