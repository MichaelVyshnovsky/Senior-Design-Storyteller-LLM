The '''''stasis sphere''''' was a [[magical item]]. When touched by its owner and commanded, one nearby creature could be placed in ''[[temporal stasis]]'' and confined inside the sphere, similar to the ''[[imprisonment]]'' spell.

==Description==
The sphere was a greenish and glowing sphere made of crystal, around 8 feet (2.4 meters) in diameter and weighing 1000 pounds (453 kilograms). Inside the sphere, there was an extra-dimensional space in which as many as fifty creatures could be confined. With a second command, a creature could be freed. Once the sphere has been used fifty times, it could no longer confine new creatures.

==History==
It was created in the age of [[Netheril]].

It was used by [[Telkoun Adranther]] in the [[Telkoun's Tower]] for his creepy experiments.
