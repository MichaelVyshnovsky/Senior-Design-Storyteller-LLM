        "Description": "The sword was described as \"brilliant\".",
        "Powers": "''Crusader'' was a ''+5 [[holy avenger]] [[longsword]]'', with all the magical powers that went with such a weapon, namely dispelling magic and doing extra harm to evil creatures.\n\nFurthermore, once a day each, it could heal the injured of all their wounds (as with ''[[heal]]''); increase the wielder's strength (as with ''[[strength]]'') when in combat against evil, and ''charm'' people on touch (as with ''[[charm person]]''). These powers were gained the first time it was used to slay a major demon. Once a week, it could also be used to [[commune]] with Lalibela.\n\nIt also had a chance to utterly obliterate (as with ''[[disintegrate]]'') a demon or any of the weaker denizens of the [[Lower Planes]] on striking them in battle.\n\n''Crusader'' was an intelligent weapon, being able to communicate telepathically with its owner. It had the special purpose to slay demons, and while it wouldn't drive its wielder into reckless or suicidal actions, it loved its job. If its wielder fled from a demon once, it would howl in anguish. If they showed cowardice a second time, it would depart itself, teleporting back to Lalibela and abandoning its former owner to their fate."
