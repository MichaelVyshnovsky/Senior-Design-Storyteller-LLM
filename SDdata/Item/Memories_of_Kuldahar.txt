'''''Memories of Kuldahar''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[club]] fashioned out of a massive branch of the [[Great Oak]] of [[Kuldahar]] and believed to be a gift from [[Silvanus]], the Oak Father.

==Powers==
''Memories of Kuldahar'' carried the Great Oak's magical warmth, protecting its wielder from cold. The same nature magics made the club a powerful enchanted ''+1'' weapon.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the town of Kuldahar was besieged by forces of the [[baatezu]] [[Belhifet]] that poured over the [[Spine of the World]], being fueled by the foul magics of ''[[Crenshinibon]]''. Under the onslaught of evil, the Great Oak was battered by the fierce ice winds of the [[Frozenfar]], reducing the tree's magical ''circle of warmth'' that sheltered Kuldahar. During these storms, several branches were snapped off the Great Oak. After the siege was over, these branches were collected by the town's inhabitants and kept in their homes as a symbol of Kulpahar's perseverance in the face of grave odds. With time, several of the branches found their way to the [[Ten Towns]], and one became a magical club known as ''Memories of Kuldahar''.

At one point before [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Memories of Kuldahar'' was in stock of the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]] and available for purchase from [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in [[Targos]].
