        "mainbody": "Potions of dragons blood were potions imbued with divine magic, used by the clerics of Kelemvor to consecrate shrines.\nFollowing the Time of Troubles and the apotheosis of the new god of death Kelemvor, many of his new followers set out on a holy mission of claiming shrines and temple of then perished god of death, Myrkul. Part of the consecration ceremony when claiming Myrkuls shrines was using the potions of dragons blood to cleanse the corruption. The consecration ceremony also broke any enchantments that were placed upon the shrine.\nIn 1370 DR, a Kelemvorite wandering priest Daland descended to Undermountain on the mission to consecrate the shrines in the temple of Myrkul on the Dungeon Level. While in the temples crypts, Daland picked up a cursed scroll and became trapped like a living statue. Luckily, soon after, an agent of Khelben Arunsun arrived at the temple in search of the Black Wand of Myrkul. Daland begged for help. He asked the adventurer to use his potion of dragons blood consecrating the shrine and dispelling the curse."
