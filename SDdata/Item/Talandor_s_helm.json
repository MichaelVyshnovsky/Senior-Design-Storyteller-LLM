        "mainbody": "A Talandors helm was a magical helmet, the first of which was made by Arghorst Talandor.\nThey resembled any human-sized metal war-helm.\nAfter being worn for an unbroken period of 24 hours, a link was formed between the wearer and the helm. It could afterwards maintain this mental link within a  radius, or travel anywhere within  at a flight speed somewhat faster than a mans pace. So long as the mental link held, the wearer could see and hear out of the helm, and speak out of it at will, so long as he wasnt doing anything more strenuous than casting a simple spell the link could not be used while fighting or studying, for instance.\nThe helm could not be used to speak command words, but it could unleash spells cast by the user, at their choice the helm was quite accurate, more than most mages, where it came to attacks, and it could physically attack, dealing similar damage to a club. Additionally to attacking, the helm could be used for physical manipulation, and albeit it was not designed for it, it could accomplish just about the same as one could with a small hammer. Though it was subject to most attacks, it was more resilient than most mages could be expected to be, and it was immune to both electricity and psionics. The helm actually absorbed magic missiles.\nSending the helm past  caused strain on the wearer, and the link could only endure then for about 90 minutes for an average person, with someone of exceptional fortitude lasting up to twice as much, before rest was needed.It is unclear how the helm could be sent past the range of the mental link, or whether the other functions worked between 70 and 700 miles, or past 700 miles, or what functions are shut down once rest is needed.\nArghorst Talandor designed the helms while in office.\nThalandors helms were most often used to watch over troves and hoards."
