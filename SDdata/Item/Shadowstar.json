        "mainbody": "The Shadowstar was a powerful artifact created by Gond that was the key to the prison of the shadevari. The shadevari could communicate via the Shadowstar they used it to corrupt Verraketh, and that led to him becoming the first Shadowking.\nThe Shadowstar was buried with the Shadowking in his crypt. However, with its collapse after the defeat of the Shadowking, Ferret Talondim, who was still trapped inside, found it and it teleported him to hills outside Soubar. The Shadowstar helped him start his own crime business.\nAfter the reformed Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon saved Caledan Caldorien in 1364 DR, Kellen Caldorien was in possession of the Shadowstar. However, he was immune to the corruption of the shadevari, thanks to him having the power of shadow magic and being mageborn."
