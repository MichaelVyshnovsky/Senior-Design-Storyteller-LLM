        "mainbody": "The '''Shadowstar''' was a powerful [[artifact]] created by [[Gond]] that was the key to the prison of the [[shadevari]]. The shadevari could communicate via the Shadowstar; they used it to corrupt [[Verraketh]], and that led to him becoming the first Shadowking.<ref>\n\nThe Shadowstar was buried with the Shadowking in his crypt. However, with its collapse after the defeat of the Shadowking, [[Ferret Talondim]], who was still trapped inside, found it and it teleported him to hills outside [[Soubar]]. The Shadowstar helped him start his own crime business.<ref>\n\nAfter the reformed [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]] saved [[Caledan Caldorien]] in [[1364 DR]], [[Kellen Caldorien]] was in possession of the Shadowstar. However, he was immune to the corruption of the shadevari, thanks to him having the power of [[shadow magic]] and being mageborn.<ref>"
