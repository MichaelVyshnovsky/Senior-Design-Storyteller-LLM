A tantan, known as a tambourine on other worlds, was a type of percussion instrument.The tantan appears to bear no relation to the tan-tan, a large drum from Brazil.
Tantans consisted of jangling hoops that were used to emphasize rhythms in ensembles and to enhance campfire dances.
Tantans crafted by the masters of the plains of the Hordelands and traded through Semphar were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue states that the tantans are made by "the masters of the plains" and come from "the long trade routes from Semphar" (not necessarily Semphar itself). It is unclear who these masters are and what plains are being referred to, but the most notable plains beyond Semphar are those of the Hordelands.
