'''''Bowls of blood''''' were a type of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] bowl that filled with fresh blood on command.

==Description==
This bowl had a similar appearance to many other magical bowls in the Realms, such as the ''[[bowl of commanding water elementals]]''. They were often carved out of a massive [[bloodstone]] gem and were about {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}} in diameter and {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} deep.

==Powers==
This bowl magically itself with blood. This was done either upon command, once every twenty four hours, or every four minutes after an activation. While inside it, the blood conjured by the bowl did not congeal. There were a variety of applications for this including writing [[ink]], [[material component]]s, medical supplies, a lure for sanguivorous creatures like [[stirge]]s, or blinding one's opponent. Some versions could be commanded to fill up to three time per day, but vanished after fifty uses.

In the case of medical use, this blood was compatible with any blood type. Around 80% of these bowls conjured [[human]] blood, but there some that contained the blood of [[elves]], [[gnome]]s, or even [[dragon]]s. This last type only had a limited number of uses, ranging from nine to ninety, and would vanish once it reached that limit.

==Notable Owners==
The master [[vampire]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Artor Morlin]], was known to have one of these installed in his coffin hidden in the [[Fireplace Level]] below the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.
