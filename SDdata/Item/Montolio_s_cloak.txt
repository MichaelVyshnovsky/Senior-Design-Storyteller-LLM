Montolios cloak was a magical cloak that was named after and worn by the Mielikkian ranger Montolio Debrouchee.
The garment comprised a short-length cloak that was fastened by a unique clasp. If the two pieces were seperated, Montolios cloak temporarily lost the magical enchantments it held.
In addition to bolstering the inherent mental and physical defenses of its wearer, the cloak conveyed upon them some of the fighting skill that was possessed by its namesake it allowed them to fight more effectively while wielding a weapon in either hand.
In the decades after Montolios death, the cloak and brooch were separated from one another and scattered across the Lands of Intrigue. 
At some point before the , Montolios cloak came into the possession of the mage Omar Harad, while the clasp was lost deep within the fortress of Watchers Keep in Tethyr.
