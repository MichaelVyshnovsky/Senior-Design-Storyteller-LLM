The chien was the highest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur.
The chien took the form of a small bar or miniature ingot minted from silver. One chien was worth 10 taels, 10 chao, 200 yuan, or 1000 fen.
Being clumsy to carry, the chien was rarely used in everyday trade, and instead saved or hoarded for large purchases or in the event of financial collapse.
