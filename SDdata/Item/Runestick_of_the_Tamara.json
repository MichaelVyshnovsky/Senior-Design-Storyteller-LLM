        "mainbody": "The Runestick of the Tamara was a unique, powerful enchanted staff that unveiled its true magics in the hands of a servant of the Tamara.\nThe planar sorcery that empowered the Runestick of the Tamara allowed the wilder to comprehend and memorize a variety of additional arcane spells each day. Simply holding the Runestick allows the owner to cast cats grace, endurance, fly, haste, and see invisibility spells. Any individual who did not serve the Tamara attempted to wield the staff, it was immediately consumed by magical flames.\nThe Runestick of the Tamara was entrusted to the dreaded Mother of a Thousand Young by her extraplanar masters â€“ the Tamara. In the Year of Tigers Curse, late 14 century DR, the Mother wielded the magic items against a band of heroes of the Living Jungles who infiltrated her base in attempts to stop the Mother from birthing a horde of ravenous spider katanga."
