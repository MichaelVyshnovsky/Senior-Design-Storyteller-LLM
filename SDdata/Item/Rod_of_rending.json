        "mainbody": "A rod of rending was an enchanted rod favored by servants of the Savage God Ragarra in Zakhara.\nThese rods were typically made from ebony and had a crocodiles claw attached to one end.\nAs with the rending spell used by cultists of Ragarra, this rod was used to destroy personal property, including both livestock and slaves. Up to 8 cubic feet of matter could be destroyed at a time with this item. The magic had no effect if used on a free citizen or a wild creature."
