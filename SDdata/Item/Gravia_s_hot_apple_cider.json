        "mainbody": "ravias hot apple cider was a popular and sometimes drugged apple libation prepared by Gravia Maxillian of the Maxillian Manor from the Western Farmlands circa 1372 DR.\nGravias hot apple cider was prepared using the fresh Maxillian apple orchard juice. A standard recipe called for half a gallon of freshly pressed juice, two cinnamon sticks, two whole cloves, two allspice berries, a handful of lemon and orange peel, slices into stripes.\nApple juice was simmered in a huge pot on the open fire along with the peel and spices neatly wrapped in a piece of cloth. A batch of Gravias cider took about two hours to cook. These drinks were served hot.\nGravia Maxillian developed the recipe sometime after she was turned into a lycanthrope by Jonas Maxillian Senior. This cider was often used to lure unsuspecting passers by into the clutches of hungry werewolves. The guests were drugged, using knockout drops added to the stein of cider just before serving."
