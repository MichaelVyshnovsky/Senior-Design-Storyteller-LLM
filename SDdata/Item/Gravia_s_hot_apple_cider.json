        "mainbody": "'''''Gravia's hot apple cider''''' was a popular and sometimes drugged [[apple]] libation prepared by [[Gravia Maxillian]] of the [[Maxillian Manor]] from the [[Western Farmlands]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Gravia's hot apple cider was prepared using the fresh Maxillian apple orchard juice. A standard recipe called for half a gallon of freshly pressed juice, two [[cinnamon]] sticks, two whole [[clove]]s, two [[allspice]] berries, a handful of [[lemon]] and [[orange]] peel, slices into stripes.\n\nApple juice was simmered in a huge pot on the open fire along with the peel and spices neatly wrapped in a piece of cloth. A batch of Gravia's cider took about two hours to cook. These drinks were served hot.",
        "History": "Gravia Maxillian developed the recipe sometime after she was turned into a [[lycanthrope]] by [[Jonas Maxillian Senior]]. This cider was often used to lure unsuspecting passers by into the clutches of hungry [[werewolves]]. The guests were drugged, using [[knockout drops]] added to the stein of cider just before serving."
