Spatulas, referred to as osaye in Wa-an, the Vast, and on Wa.
Spatulas were defined by their large, flat heads that allowed them to carry food and other substances.
Spatulas were commonly used as cookware across the Realms. 
In Wa, a special metal-tipped osaye could be used to serve powdered incense during an incense ceremony.
Spatulas were also used as a tool for spreading non-food pastes and plasters, similar to trowels.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, the cargo ship The Gentle Lady was delivering a shipment of farmer and merchant goods to a small coastal community in the Dragon Reach. Among the goods being carried by the ship was a crate full of cookware that included eighteen spatulas.
