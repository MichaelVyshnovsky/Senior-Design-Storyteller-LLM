        "Description": "An ulu was a small blade sized to be used with one hand. It had a handle in the center, sometimes made of [[scrimshaw]], with a blade affixed to it in a half-moon shape. The knife was used by rocking it back and forth, easily cutting through whatever it was used on.",
        "History": "As of the late 1480s [[DR]], ulu knives were commonly used across the [[Ten Towns]] of Icewind Dale, and were often considered to be useful trinkets."
