The '''''Bow of Arvoreen''''' was an [[enchanted]] red [[shortbow]] wielded by an aspiring [[halfling]] [[paladin]], [[Mazzy Fentan]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The bow was imbued with divine magics and possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and could only be wielded by a halfling.

==History==
This bow was gifted to Mazzy Fentan several years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}} by her deity â€“ [[Arvoreen]], The Vigilant Guardian. The bow remained in her hands as she set out to stand against the [[Shade Lord]] and his pet [[dragon]] [[Thaxll'ssillyia]], who infested an ancient ruined temple dedicated to [[Amaunator]] with darkness.
