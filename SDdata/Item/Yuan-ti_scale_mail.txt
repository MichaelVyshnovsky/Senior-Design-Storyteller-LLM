'''''Yuan-ti scale mail''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[medium armor]] made by the [[yuan-ti]], the serpentfolk of [[Chult]].

==Description==
These sets of robust magic armor were forged together using yuan-ti shed skin, giving it green reptilian hue.

==Powers==
Made out of exotic material, ''yuan-ti scale mail'' was a protective type of medium armor that acted like a set of [[leather armor|leathers]]: it allowed the wearer full mobility, making it more useful for dexterous individuals, rather than physically strong warriors. The armor's magic also boosted the wearer's initiative and creation in battle.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Talli]], a [[Harper]] quartermaster, who followed a fellow Harper hero [[Jaheira]] to the [[Last Light Inn]] in the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
