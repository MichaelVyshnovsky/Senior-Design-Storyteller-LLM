        "mainbody": "'''''The Skinburster''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[halberd]] that allowed the wielder to accumulate force energy, created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''The Skinburster''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> enchantments made the weapon emit a gentle yellow light in which its curved blade resembled an unnerving smile. The weapon also possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that made its blade more deadly, and it guided the wielder's aim towards the target. Lastly, the weapon's ''skinburster force'' magic imbued the wielder with a charge of magical force energy upon a successful strike, making them a ''force conduit'' for twelve seconds. By itself, this enchantment had little utility but could be synergized with other magic items that allowed for the release of the accumulated force.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Skinburster'' belonged to Inquisitor [[W'wargaz]] of [[Cr√®che Y'llek]]. The weapon was stored in W'wargaz's quarters in the ruined Rosymorn Monastery, in the chamber that once hid relics of the monastery."
