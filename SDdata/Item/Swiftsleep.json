        "mainbody": "'''Swiftsleep''' was a common [[poison]] found in [[Faer√ªn]]. It caused a victim to fall asleep for many minutes.",
        "Description": "This substance was a sticky, viscous liquid that resembled [[honey]] the color of brown [[ale]].",
        "Creation": "Swiftsleep used a base of [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] tree sap. This was infused with a distillate of the crushed remains of flies and common tree beetles. The abundant ingredients and relatively simple recipe made this widely available at a low price.",
        "Usage": "This poison had to enter the bloodstream to be effective, typically by a wound from an edged weapon or arrow. The victim fell unconscious almost immediately, as if in gentle repose. The induced sleep lasted many minutes for a first-time victim, but each successive exposure to swiftsleep was less and less effective in duration, until an individual that suffered multiple doses became completely immune to its effects."
