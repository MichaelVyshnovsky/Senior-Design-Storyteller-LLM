A '''''ring of invisibility''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[ring]] that allowed the wearer to turn invisible at will.

==Description==
It appeared to be an unremarkable [[silver]] ring,

==Powers==
When they so wished, the wearer of this ring could turn invisible, The power of these rings functioned automatically whenever the wearer desired so long as the ring was worn. One in ten ''rings of invisibility'' also made the wearer inaudible. A wearer of one of the inaudible variants could speak if they desired, but would cease the inaudible function of the ring for that moment.

They remained in this state until they removed the ring, cast a spell, or attacked any person or creature.

The ring had an unlimited number of uses.<ref>

A cursed ''ring of invisibility'' could simply disappear at inopportune times<ref> or make only the wearer invisible, not their clothing and carried items.<ref>

==Creation==
To make a ''ring of invisibility'', one required skill in forging rings and the spell ''invisibility''. The silver used should also be pure or from an existing ''ring of invisibility''.<ref>

==Notable Rings==
* ''[[Sandthief's ring]]'': A number of these rings were used by the [[Waterdhavian]] master [[thief]] known as the [[Sand Thief]].
