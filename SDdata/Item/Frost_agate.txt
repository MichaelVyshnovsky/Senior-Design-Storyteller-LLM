'''Frost agate''', also called '''frost stone''', was a beautiful member of the [[agate]] family found in the Realms. They were sacred to the [[Elf|elven]] god [[Erevan Ilesere]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==Description==
These rare [[ornamental stones]] had white markings that resembled frost over the base color of the stone. They were usually tumbled and polished to a beautiful glassy finish. A master [[wikipedia:lapidarist|lapidarist]] could cut the fragile stone in [[wikipedia:facet|facets]], such as in a [[wikipedia:polyhedron|polyhedron]] cut,<ref group="note">The shape of a d20. so that at each point where facets met, a "snowflake" of white "frost" appeared.

==Powers==
Frost agates were often enchanted to be ''[[luckstone|luckstones]]''. Low quality stones were treated like other agates: powdered for use in sleeping draughts and other potions.See the potion compatibility table on page 141 of the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 2nd edition]]'', for example.
