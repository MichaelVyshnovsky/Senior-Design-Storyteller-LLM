The '''''Soultaker dagger''''', also referred to simply as '''''Soultaker''''', was a [[magic]]al [[dagger]] that could trap within it the soul of a being killed with its blade.

==Description==
The dagger had unique physical properties: it was warm in the hands of its wielder, felt as if were heavier than its actual weight, and radiated a sense of emotional unrest.

Set into its hilt was a black gem that possessed an inner radiance.

==Powers==
As its name suggested the dagger could ''take'' the soul of another living being. This was shown to be true for both mortals from the [[Prime Material Plane]] and even a [[demon]] from the [[Abyss]].

==History==
The ''Soultaker dagger'' was once owned by a [[dwarf]] of [[Clan Stoneblade]]. When this dwarf and his companion [[Durlag Trollkiller]] fought the [[nabassu]] known as [[Aec'Letec]], Durlag used the blade to entrap the demon's soul. Before it could be returned to the Stoneblade dwarves, it was set aside by Durlag during his descent into madness and forgotten about within his [[Durlag's Tower|namesake tower]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Hurgan Stoneblade]] sought to retrieve his grandfather's dagger from within [[Durlag's Tower]]. At the same time, [[Tracea Carol]] and a group of cultists dedicated to Aec'Letec began their efforts to recover it for their own use.

Some months later, ''Soultaker'' was used by an [[Jon Irenicus|anonymous hooded figure]] to slay the [[Baldurian]] noble [[Skie Silvershield]]. As her soul became trapped within the weapon, she could not be resurrected despite the efforts made by her father [[Entar Silvershield|Duke Entar Silvershield]].
