        "mainbody": "A war wizard cloak was a powerful magical item given to trusted agents of Cormyr.\nThey were long, black weathercloaks that could cover the arms, chest and legs of the wearer, with high collars and attachable hoods. They bore a purple dragon insignia on the left collar and another on the back of the hood. The right collar bore the design of an upraised human palm in a white circle.\nThe cloak provided protection against extreme cold as a ring of warmth did, and conferred infravision on the wearer. It also provided protection from normal missiles, feather fall and ironguard. It could be used to cast sending and dimension door once each per day."
