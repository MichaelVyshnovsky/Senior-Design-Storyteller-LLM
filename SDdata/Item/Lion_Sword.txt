The '''Lion Sword''' was a magic [[sword]] once wielded by King [[Uthgrael Aumar]] and given to his son [[Elthryn Aumar]] when he retired to [[Heldon]]. The sword was destroyed in [[224 DR]] by [[Undarl]] when he burned Heldon to the ground and slew Elthryn. The broken hilt was then taken up by [[Elminster Aumar]] and used to support his claim to the Stag Throne of [[Athalantar]].
