During the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, the secrets of crafting shields of dawn were passed along by Lathander to his devotees. While walking the Realms, Lathander was disturbed by the numbers of undead creatures plaguing the world. He wanted to arm his clerics and the allies of the Church of Lathander in their unending quest to destroy the monsters. Since then, these shields became common gear in the possession of clerics and paladins of Lathander.
In 1372 DR, shields of dawn could be acquired via priests in the temples of Lathander in Neverwinter and Daggerford.
