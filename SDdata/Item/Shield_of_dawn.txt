'''''Shields of dawn''''' were enchanted [[buckler]]s and [[tower shield]]s created by [[Lathander]] to arm good clerics against the [[undead]].

==Powers==
''Shields of dawn'' were created in two forms. The regular-powered small shields provided a small improvement to the wielder's  armor, became ''+2'' enchanted shields when used against undead, and glowed with a gentle white light of {{SIAdj|10|'"|long=yes}} radius.

''Great shields of dawn'' were enchanted tower shields that provided the wielder with good armor and possessed a ''+5'' enchantment when used against the undead. Its white light was projected with a {{SIAdj|15|'"|long=yes}} radius.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the secrets of crafting ''shields of dawn'' were passed along by Lathander to his devotees. While walking the Realms, Lathander was disturbed by the numbers of undead creatures plaguing the world. He wanted to arm his [[cleric]]s and the allies of the [[Church of Lathander]] in their unending quest to destroy the monsters. Since then, these shields became common gear in the possession of [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of Lathander.

In [[1372 DR]], ''shields of dawn'' could be acquired via priests in the temples of Lathander in [[Neverwinter]] and [[Daggerford]].

==Notable Owners==
* Dawnbringer [[Natrisse]]: a cleric of Lathander in Neverwinter's [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].
* [[Kaelyn|Kaelyn the Dove]]: the [[half-celestial]] companion of the [[Kalach-Cha]].
