        "Powers": "''Staves of command'' had three functions and were most effective if wielded by [[cleric]]s since they had access to all three powers. The staff granted the wielder the ''[[charm person]]'' and ''[[suggestion]]'' abilities to be used against [[human]]s. Against animals the staff granted the ''[[ring of mammal control|mammal control]]'' ability if used by a wizard and the ''[[potion of animal control|animal control]]'' ability if used by a cleric. Lastly, clerics were able to control plant life within a {{SI|10|ft}} square.\n\nEach use of the staff depleted a single charged. ''Staves of command'' could be recharged.",
