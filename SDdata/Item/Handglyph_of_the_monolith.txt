A '''''handglyph of the monolith''''' was a powerful [[handglyph]] used by the [[Geomancer]]s of [[Kadar]] to summon a fearsome [[earth elemental|earth monolith]].

==Powers==
These items summoned a powerful earth monolith which served the wielder for up to nine hours. The summoned earth monolith would be strongest if the substrate of the surrounding area was composed of clay, mud, or earth. A weaker earth monolith would be summoned if the substrate was sand or rough stone. A substrate of worked stone would prevent the monolith from appearing. The summoning area had to be at least {{SI|20|sq. ft|long=yes}} with a volume of {{SI|20|cbft|long=yes}}.

The wielder had to maintain solid focus in order to control the earth monolith, preventing them from performing any other actions.

Most ''handglyphs of the monolith'' had 1â€”3 charges and could only be used once per week. There was no known way to recharge them.

==Description==
These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes.

==Notable Owners==
[[Tisan Balshareska]] had one of these items.
