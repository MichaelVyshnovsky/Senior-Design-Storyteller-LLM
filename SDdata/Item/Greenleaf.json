        "mainbody": "Greenleaf was the name given to a number of enchanted leather armors of elvish making.\nThese sets of armor were cleverly design to resemble the leafage of elven forests.\nGreenleaves possessed potent +5 enchantment that increased the wearers abilities to hide and meld into shadow or into the greenery of the forest.\nOriginally crafted by elven armorers to defend their homes, after the exodus of the Calling, some of the Greenleaf leathers fell into the hands of adventurers, and later sold through black markets by the late 14 century DR. Even though The Retreat was over by that time, not many elves expressed their opinions of the scavenged sets of enchanted armor that was taken from their old homes."
