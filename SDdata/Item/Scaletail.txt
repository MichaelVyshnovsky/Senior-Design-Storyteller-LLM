'''Scaletail''' was the [[Delzimmer|Delzemaeran]] name for fried [[snake]] and [[lizard]] meat on a stick. This dish was popular across southern [[Faerûn]] in lands that touched the [[Shining Sea]] or the [[Great Sea]], but rarely seen farther north than the [[Calim Desert]].

==Description==
In Delzimmer, scaletail was made from the local and plentiful, hand-sized [[Lizard#Varieties|klonthaer]] and [[Lizard#Varieties|bharang]] lizards and the somewhat less plentiful but much larger [[Snake#Species|mushroom snake]]. The heads, tails, and extremities were cut off, the guts removed, and the remainder was flayed and filleted into strips and mounted on [[skewer]]s. These skewers were either deep fried in spiced [[oil]]s for immediate consumption, or smoked and dried for trail [[ration]]s or snacks.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|49}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 41: Delzemaeran Delicacies, Part 3}}

A full skewer typically cost three [[copper piece]]s from a street vendor, while a platter-full of skewers could be had for a [[silver piece]]. Use of more exotic reptile meats tripled the price.
