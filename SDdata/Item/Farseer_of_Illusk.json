        "mainbody": "The ''farseer of Illusk'' was a magical telescope used by the [[Academy of Stargazers]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was built on the top level of [[Castle Naerytar]]'s keep. While the castle was occupied by the [[Cult of the Dragon]], [[Rezmir]] used the telescope to observe [[Voaraghamanthar]] in the dragons lair, through wich she discovered the dragon's secret twin. To protected the telescope room, Rezmir convinved four Gargoyles to stand watch over it."
