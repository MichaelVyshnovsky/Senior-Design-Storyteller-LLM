'''''Boots of the tortoise''''' were a type of magically enchanted footwear of both positive and negative effects.

==Description==
''Boots of the tortoise'' were strangely heavy boots made out of olive-colored leather.

==Powers==
These boots gave the wearer strong enchanted defenses and improved all resistances. In exchange, the boots slowed the wearer to a [[turtle|tortoise]]'s movement speed.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], a pair of ''boots of the tortoise'' was in the possession of a [[dark naga]] that laired in the tombs under the [[House Ammath]] mansion in [[Glim-Gardens]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. The boots, along with the ''[[gauntlets of ogre size]]'' and [[Alaric's charm]], were locked away in the naga's treasure chests.
