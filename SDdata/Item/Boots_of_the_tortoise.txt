Boots of the tortoise were a type of magically enchanted footwear of both positive and negative effects.
Boots of the tortoise were strangely heavy boots made out of olive-colored leather.
These boots gave the wearer strong enchanted defenses and improved all resistances. In exchange, the boots slowed the wearer to a tortoises movement speed.
In 1369 DR, a pair of boots of the tortoise was in the possession of a dark naga that laired in the tombs under the House Ammath mansion in Glim-Gardens of Myth Drannor. The boots, along with the gauntlets of ogre size and Alarics charm, were locked away in the nagas treasure chests.
