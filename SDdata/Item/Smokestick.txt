A smokestick was a wooden stick treated with an alchemical substance that released a great deal of smoke when ignited. A smokestick would only burn for less than about ten seconds, but during that time, it created enough thick, black smoke to fill a volume of  1,000 cubic feet (28 cubic meters).
Smokesticks weighed about half a pound (200 grams) and sold for about 20 gold pieces in most markets.
During the decade of Spellplague, smokesticks were made out of alchemical clay and were priced around 150 gold pieces.
The drow wizard Valas Jaelre was known to craft smokesticks for a drow outpost located in Cormanthor. Smokesticks were also sold by Angrath Dree from her shop, Old Angraths Smokehouse.
