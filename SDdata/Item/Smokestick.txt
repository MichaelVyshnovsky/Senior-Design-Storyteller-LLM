A '''smokestick''' was a wooden stick treated with an [[Alchemist|alchemical]] substance that released a great deal of smoke when ignited. A smokestick would only burn for less than about ten seconds, but during that time, it created enough thick, black smoke to fill a volume of  1,000 cubic feet (28 cubic meters).

Smokesticks weighed about half a pound (200 grams) and sold for about 20 [[gold piece]]s in most markets.

During the decade of [[Spellplague]], ''smokesticks'' were made out of ''alchemical [[clay]]'' and were priced around 150 [[gold]] pieces.

==Notable Crafters==
The [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Valas Jaelre]] was known to craft smokesticks for a drow outpost located in [[Cormanthor]]. Smokesticks were also sold by [[Angrath Dree]] from her shop, [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]].{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|84}}
