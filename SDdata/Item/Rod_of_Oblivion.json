        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the [[avatar]] of Shar appeared in [[Waterdeep]], where she masqueraded as the avatar of her divine rival, [[Selûne]], until she was exposed by the adventurers [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Kyriani]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], and [[Luna]] who was the true avatar of Selûne. Finally, amidst the ruins of the [[Selûne's Smile]] inn she'd destroyed, Shar confronted the heroes. Wielding the ''Rod of Oblivion'' in all its dark glory, Shar threatened to have her revenge on them and to slay Selûne once and for all. She very nearly achieved this, but the adventurers released Selûne's full divine power to Luna. The revitalized avatar of Selûne cancelled the ''Rod of Oblivion'' and destroyed the avatar of Shar. The rod fell to the ground.\n\nIt was apparently recovered and kept within the vaults of the [[House of the Moon]], the temple of Selûne in Waterdeep, by [[1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Some {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}}, it had a golden shaft and was topped by a dark-hued [[emerald]], cut in three distinct levels and the size of a fist. When active, jet-black lightning shot forth from the gem in all directions.",
