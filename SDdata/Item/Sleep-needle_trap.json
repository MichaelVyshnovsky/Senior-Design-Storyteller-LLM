        "mainbody": "'''Sleep-needle traps''' were a type of [[trap]] in common use for household security across [[Turmish]] by the 1360s DR. They were developed by the apothecary [[Phindal]] of [[Gildenglade]].{{Cite polyhedron/101/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Turmish Customers and Festivals|23}}",
        "Description": "Of simple design, they comprised thorns dipped in a clear waxy oil that dried to a soft, crumbly texture.",
        "Powers": "On contacting exposed skin, the unidentified [[poison]] could cause a person who could not resist to fall unconscious for a few minutes. The coating was effective for up to five such contacts and the effect was cumulative, with multiple contacts making the victim more likely to succumb.",
        "Usage": "Used in houses and stables, these could be concealed in locks, doorframes, and window frames and other places where an unwary thief would put their hand."
