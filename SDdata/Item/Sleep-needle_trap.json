        "mainbody": "Sleep-needle traps were a type of trap in common use for household security across Turmish by the 1360s DR. They were developed by the apothecary Phindal of Gildenglade.\nOf simple design, they comprised thorns dipped in a clear waxy oil that dried to a soft, crumbly texture.\nOn contacting exposed skin, the unidentified poison could cause a person who could not resist to fall unconscious for a few minutes. The coating was effective for up to five such contacts and the effect was cumulative, with multiple contacts making the victim more likely to succumb.\nUsed in houses and stables, these could be concealed in locks, doorframes, and window frames and other places where an unwary thief would put their hand."
