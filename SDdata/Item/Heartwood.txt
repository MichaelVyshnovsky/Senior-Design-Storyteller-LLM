Heartwood was a worked piece of magical wood found in the late 15 century DR. Due to its unique properties, it was able to be used similarly to a docent of Eberron.
When installed in a warforged, heartwood spread green mossy growth across their body.
The living wood greatly enhanced the protective and regenerative properties of a warforgeds form while it was used.
Heartwood was found in the treasure pile of the red dragon Daeronnax, the master of Clan Daeronnax in the Stonelands after he kidnapped the adventurer Tristran of Daggerford.
