Finchs finest hat was one of several enchanted hats that once belonged to an infamous bard Finch in the late 14 century DR.
This hat was enchanted with several beneficial types of magic. The finest hat boosted the wearers charisma and increased their dexterity. Additionally, the wearer became masterfully adept at diplomacy, bluffing, and showmanship, and their hands became as noble as a master pick-pockets.
Finch the Bard found his fame as an artist and infamy as a paramour. After he fled from Cormyr, pursued by a bounty hunter â€“ the result of seducing a wrong noblemans daughter, he bemoaned the loss of his favorite magic hat. Eventually, his travels led him to the city of Mulsantir in snowy Rashemen. He continued performing and acquiring new paramours. One such woman was a young hathran who volunteered to enchant Finch a new big-brimmed hat with a single plump red feather pinned to its dome. Finchs new finest hat was more powerful and splendorous than the beloved lost headwear. However, soon after, the young hathran discovered Finch became "friendly" with another young witch, and the bard fled yet again in fear for his life, leaving yet another hat behind.
In the , Finchs finest hat belonged to a dwarven across and thespian named Magda of the Veil Theater.
