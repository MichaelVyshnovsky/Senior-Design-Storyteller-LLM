'''''Finch's finest hat''''' was one of several [[enchanted]] hats that once belonged to an infamous [[bard]] [[Finch (half-elf)|Finch]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This hat was enchanted with several beneficial types of magic. The ''finest hat'' boosted the wearer's charisma and increased their dexterity. Additionally, the wearer became masterfully adept at diplomacy, bluffing, and showmanship, and their hands became as noble as a master pick-pocket's.

==History==
Finch the Bard found his fame as an artist and infamy as a paramour. After he fled from [[Cormyr]], pursued by a bounty hunter â€“ the result of seducing a wrong nobleman's daughter, he bemoaned the loss of his favorite magic hat. Eventually, his travels led him to the city of [[Mulsantir]] in snowy [[Rashemen]]. He continued performing and acquiring new paramours. One such woman was a young [[hathran]] who volunteered to enchant Finch a new big-brimmed hat with a single plump red feather pinned to its dome. ''Finch's new finest hat'' was more powerful and splendorous than the beloved lost headwear. However, soon after, the young hathran discovered Finch became "friendly" with another young witch, and the bard fled yet again in fear for his life, leaving yet another hat behind.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Finch's finest hat'' belonged to a [[dwarf|dwarven]] across and thespian named [[Magda (Mulsantir)|Magda]] of the [[Veil Theater]].
