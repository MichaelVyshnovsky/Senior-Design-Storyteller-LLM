'''''Gelugon's Gouge''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[spear]] fashioned out of a tail of an [[ice devil]].

==Powers==
This [[polearm]]'s head was a tail spike of an unlucky gelugon. The weapon was always cold to the touch. It was imbued with a ''+1'' enchantment and burned its targets with the ice devil's freezing magic. Upon a successful strike, the spear had a chance of ''[[slow]]ing'' its target down.

==History==
One of ''Gelugon's Gouge'' magic weapons was hidden deep inside a vault of the Temple of [[Bhaal]] in the town of [[Liam's Hold]], later known as the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]]. The enchanted spear was deposited there sometime before the temple's fall and abandonment during the [[Time of Troubles]]. As of [[1372 DR]], the spear was still locked behind the vault's hidden door and guarded by three [[gargoyle]]s.
