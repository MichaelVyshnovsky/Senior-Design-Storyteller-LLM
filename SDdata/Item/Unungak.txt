An '''unungak''' was a type of harpoon used by [[Angulutiun]] and [[Iulutiun]] hunters.

==Description==
An unungak measured about {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length, featuring a sturdy wooden shaft and a razor-sharp bone tip. To enhance its strength, leather cords were tightly wound around the front of the shaft and securely fastened along its length. This meticulous binding added durability to the weapon, ensuring its reliability in demanding situations.
