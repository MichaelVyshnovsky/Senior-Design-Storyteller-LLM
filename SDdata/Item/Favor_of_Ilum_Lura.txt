'''''Favor of Ilum Lura''''' was a set of unique [[enchanted]] gloves that dated back to the ancient [[Illefarn]].

==Powers==
''Favor of Ilum Lura'' significantly enhanced the wearer's dexterity.

==History==
These magic gloves originated from [[Nivian]], a city in Illefarn. In {{YearlinkName|-1239}}, the champion of Nivian's Artisan's District was [[Beloran]]. He was madly in love with the ruler's niece, the beautiful [[Ilum Lura]]. Beloran remained the champion for the next six years, clamoring for the woman's hand through becoming the city's Grand Champion. Ilum's father, impressed with the champion, commanded his daughter to gift Beloran with a traditional token of favor. She presented the champion with a pair of enchanted riding gloves. In the following championship, Beloran fought even fiercer than before as the tradition dictated that the token's presenter was to reward the champion with a kiss. Ilum reluctantly kissed Beloran but revealed that her heart belonged to another. Consumed by maddening grief, Beloran left Nivian forever, still wearing the ''Favor of Ilum Lura''.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, a merchant of [[Port Llast]], [[Haljal Throndor]], owed a vast collection of enchanted items in his special stock.
