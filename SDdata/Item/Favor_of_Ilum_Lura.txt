Favor of Ilum Lura was a set of unique enchanted gloves that dated back to the ancient Illefarn.
Favor of Ilum Lura significantly enhanced the wearers dexterity.
These magic gloves originated from Nivian, a city in Illefarn. In , the champion of Nivians Artisans District was Beloran. He was madly in love with the rulers niece, the beautiful Ilum Lura. Beloran remained the champion for the next six years, clamoring for the womans hand through becoming the citys Grand Champion. Ilums father, impressed with the champion, commanded his daughter to gift Beloran with a traditional token of favor. She presented the champion with a pair of enchanted riding gloves. In the following championship, Beloran fought even fiercer than before as the tradition dictated that the tokens presenter was to reward the champion with a kiss. Ilum reluctantly kissed Beloran but revealed that her heart belonged to another. Consumed by maddening grief, Beloran left Nivian forever, still wearing the Favor of Ilum Lura.
