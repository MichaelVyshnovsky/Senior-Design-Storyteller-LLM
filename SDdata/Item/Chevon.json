        "mainbody": "'''Chevon''', or simply '''goat meat''', was a common food used in many dishes and many nations across the [[Realms]].",
        "Usages": "*One of the simplest methods of chevon preparation was found in the [[Western Heartlands]] – goat's meat was grilled over campfire, seasoned with [[pepper]] and roadside [[herb]]s.\n*Roasted goat, [[venison]], or [[pork]], as well as stews of the same meats, were common dishes served in eateries of [[Waterdeep]], including [[The Pampered Traveler]] inn and [[the Dripping Dagger]] served goat in red [[wine]] for a single [[silver]] piece.\n*In [[Calimshan]], jerked goat meat was a common ration for travelers and adventures, while roasted goat and baked [[groundnut]]s was another common if not luxurious roadside meal.\n*On the northern shores of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], a handfood called [[baeranth]] was made using various meats, including chevon.\n*Same was true for [[Cormyr]], where roast goat meat was served on [[rice]], in [[mushroom]] sauce.\n*The dish called [[Ornabra]] from [[Purskul]] in [[Amn]] was a drained stew of beef and goat meat with potatoes.\n*The [[Khazari]] folk of the [[Hordelands]] considered goat meat and mares [[milk]] to be an average morningfeast. While goat meat and fried vegetables was a common eveningfest of the [[Tuigan]]."
