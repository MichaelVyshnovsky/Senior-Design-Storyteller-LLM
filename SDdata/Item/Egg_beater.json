        "mainbody": "n egg beater was a type of cooking utensil found in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.While it is not stated in the adventure how common this item is, an educated guess can be derived from the cargo ships destination. As the shipment was going to a mere \"small coastal community\", rather than a major city, it could be reasoned that this utensil was relatively common by that time. It utilized a gear-driven mechanism to rotate a set of \"beaters\" to fulfill similar tasks as whisks (such as beating eggs).\nSometime in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the cargo ship The Gentle Lady was delivering a shipment of farmer and merchant goods to a small coastal community in the Dragon Reach. Among the goods being carried by the ship was a crate full of cookware that included four egg beaters."
