A '''rake''' was a common farming implement found in [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Rakes were often made entirely out of wood, but more expensive or magically-imbued ones were usually fitted with metal heads. The handle was usually 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 meters) long, and there were anywhere between two and twenty stiff or flexible prongs. The rake used its many-pronged head to sweep and scoop up loose materials, such as [[hay]].

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered typical rakes with heads made from twigs for 2 [[sp]], and exclusive ones with expensive [[Chult]]an [[bamboo]] heads, which were long and strong enough to gather up to {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}} of material at a time.
