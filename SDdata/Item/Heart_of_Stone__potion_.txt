Heart of Stone was a variety of potion formulated by the green hag known as Auntie Ethel, from within her cavernous lair beneath the Gnarled Teahouse of the Putrid Bog.
The fluid of this potion continually separated and amalgamated from itself in a rhythmic fashion. Small flecks of malachite were found within.
Any being that drank this draught became highly resistant to both mundane and magical poisons.
As of the , only one bottle of the Heart of Stone concoction was known to exist, found in Ethels Ancient Abode.
