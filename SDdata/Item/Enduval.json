        "Description": "The sword shone brightly.",
        "Powers": "''Enduval'' had a curse: when first used in combat, it forced its user to attack the person nearest to them, be it friend or foe. They had to keep attacking until either they or their opponent were slain; for this attack alone, it had a powerful enchantment. Only an ''[[exorcise]]'' or ''[[wish]]'' spell could rid one of this sword.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1356}}, ''Enduval'' was found in a T-shaped intersection within [[Kordan's Master Maze]] in the [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]]. There were bodies strewn around it, from which the smell of death rose; one of them was spitted with the brightly shining sword."
