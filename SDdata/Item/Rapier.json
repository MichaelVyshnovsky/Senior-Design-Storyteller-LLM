        "mainbody": "A '''rapier''' was a one-handed, martial melee weapon in the [[sword]] family.",
        "Description": "The rapier was a slender, sharply pointed sword often with a complex hilt designed to protect the wielding hand. The blade could be sharpened along some or all of the length of the blade or may not have any cutting edge at all. A typical rapier cost 20 [[gp]] and weighed {{SI|2|lbs.|long=yes}}.",
        "Weaponology": "Used mainly for thrusting and piercing attacks, it was favored by both fencers and [[duelist]]s. Rapiers were relatively light blades and quite deadly in the hands of those properly trained, therefore they were classified as martial weapons.",
        "Notable Rapiers": ";[[Dragathil]]\n:One of the [[Baneblades of Demron]]\n;[[Sembian guardblade]]\n:Expensive magical rapiers usually wielded by [[Sembia|Sembite]] nobles\n;[[Sharptongue]]\n:[[Milil]]'s holy rapier, which was sometimes loaned to his clerics."
