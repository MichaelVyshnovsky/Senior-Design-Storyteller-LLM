Pens of Oghma were minor, but convenient, magic items used by clerics of Oghma, the Lord of Knowledge.
These items were enchanted quills.
A pen of Oghma was a quill enchanted to never break, provide their own source of light controllable by the wielder that was bright enough to read and write by, and create their own neverending supply of ink that never ran or blotched.
