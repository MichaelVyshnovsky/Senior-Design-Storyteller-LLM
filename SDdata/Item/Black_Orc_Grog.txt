'''Black Orc Grog''' was a strong intoxicating brew distilled by some [[orc]]ish tribes of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].

==Description==
This dark, almost pitch-black beer was aggressively bitter and unpalatable to most non-orcs. Its sinister appearance and bitter taste made most folk think that Black Orc Grog was, indeed, an evil brew.

==History==
Black Orc Grog was concocted by orcs who were enrolled in an army of the [[Gorgomorz]]â€“[[Daggerford]]'s [[devil]] adversary. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Gorgomorz's army was hidden in caverns not far from the [[Wild Pastures]] to the west of the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]].
