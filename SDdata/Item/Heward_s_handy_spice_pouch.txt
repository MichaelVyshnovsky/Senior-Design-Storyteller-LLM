Hewards handy spice pouch was a magic pouch that was able to produce any food seasoning.
The item resembled an ordinary, empty belt pouch.
Someone holding the pouch could reach into it and speak the name of any type of nonmagical seasoning&mdashsalt, pepper, saffron etc.&mdashand produce enough of that seasoning to apply to a single meal. This power could be used up to ten times until the pouch recovered its magic at the next dawn.
