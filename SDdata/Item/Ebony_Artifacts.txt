The '''''Ebony Artifacts''''' were four weapons in which the [[lich]] [[Tan Chin]] had anchored an enchantment that would regenerate his phylactery, thus rendering him truly indestructible. These artifacts were hidden in the [[Solon#Ebony Temple|Ebony Temple]] beneath Solon.{{cite book/Blood Charge|64}}

They consisted of a dagger, a warhammer, a javelin, and a sword. All of them were weapons of awesome enhancement. All four artifacts must have been cast into the ''bottomless pit of fire'' within the Ebony Temple on {{yearlink|1360}} in order to ensure that Tan Chin's phylactery would not be restored after its destruction, causing the volcanic eruption of that same year and paving the way for the lich's destruction in {{yearlink|1362}}{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|146}}.

===Ebony Warhammer===
The ''Ebony Warhammer'' could blind permanently any target struck, but permanently reduced the wielder's constitution with each swing, whether it hit or not. It was hidden in the Dimension of Darkness room, and anyone creating a magical light strong enough to breach the darkness would be able to claim it.

===Ebony Javelin===
The ''Ebony Javelin'''s utter cold could permanently reduce the target's life force with each attack, but would reduce the wielder's strength forevermore after each swing. It was hidden in the Dimension of Cold room, and anyone surviving the deadly cold for six minutes would be able to claim it.

===Ebony Sword===
The ''Ebony Sword'' allowed the wielder to live without air, food, or water- but it permanently reduced their intelligence, and would do so again every 10 minutes this function was active. It was hidden in the Dimension of Vacuum room, and anyone surviving the lack of an atmosphere for six minutes would be able to claim it.

===Ebony Dagger===
The ''Ebony Dagger'' could cause ''[[insanity]]'' upon those struck with it, and unlike the other artifacts, it had no downside; it was hidden in the Dimension of Silence room, and anyone magically creating a sound within the room would be able to claim it.
