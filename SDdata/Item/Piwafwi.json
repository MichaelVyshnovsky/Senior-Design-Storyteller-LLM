        "mainbody": "A '''''piwafwi''''' was a [[drow]] cloak that granted increased powers of stealth and hiding. It came in two varieties, lesser and greater.",
        "Description": "A ''piwafwi'' was a dark-hued cloak.",
        "Powers": "A ''lesser piwafwi'' was identical in ability to a ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]''.\n\nA ''greater piwafwi'' was a ''piwafwi'' with the added property of fire resistance. It was also known as a ''piwafwi of fire resistance''.\n\nSome drow ''piwafwi'' cloaks that found their way to the surface possessed enchantments that protected the wearer from piercing and slashing weapons, improved their protection against various [[poison]]s, and made them unaffected by spiderwebs and the ''[[web]]'' spell. Additionally, the cloak gave non-drow who wore it the ability to summon ''[[darkness]]'' once per day.",
        "Creation": "The creator of a ''piwafwi'' had to be a drow and had to know the [[spell]]s ''[[endure elements]]'' and ''[[invisibility]]''.",
        "Uses": "Many ''piwafwi'', especially those of drow nobles or [[wizard]]s, were known to have other magical enchantments on them that made them strong enough to be resistant to magical and melee attacks.<ref><ref>\n\nLike many other drow items, direct sunlight would destroy a ''piwafwi'', rendering it useless after two weeks of exposure. Even moonlight would fade it some. This was changed when [[Liriel Baenre]] inscribed a rune on the tree [[Yggdrasil's Child]], allowing drow objects and magic to survive on the surface.<ref>\n\nBy the late 1490s [[DR]], a ''piwafwi'' would lose its magic after merely one hour of continuous exposure to sunlight."
