A web-of-bells was a costume originating from Thay typically worn by dancers.
When Volothamp Geddarm visited Elgaths Provisions in Archenbridge in Archendale, in the Dalelands, he tested proprietor Elgaths claim that he could locate any desired item for sale within a day by requesting a Thayan web-of-bells dancers costume. By the next meal that day, Elgath had found a Sembian collector willing to part with a spare, and even offered to have a fast rider collect it. Volo declined on the basis that it was not his size or shape.
