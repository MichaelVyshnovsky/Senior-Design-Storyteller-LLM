A '''web-of-bells''' was a costume originating from [[Thay]] typically worn by dancers.

==History==
When [[Volothamp Geddarm]] visited [[Elgath's Provisions]] in [[Archenbridge]] in [[Archendale]], in the [[Dalelands]], he tested proprietor [[Elgath]]'s claim that he could locate any desired item for sale within a day by requesting a Thayan web-of-bells dancer's costume. By the next meal that day, Elgath had found a [[Sembian]] collector willing to part with a spare, and even offered to have a fast rider collect it. Volo declined on the basis that it was not his size or shape.
