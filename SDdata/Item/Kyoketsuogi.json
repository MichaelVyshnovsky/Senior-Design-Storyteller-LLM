        "mainbody": "A kyoketsuogi, also known as a kyoketsu-shogi, was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur.\nA kyoketsuogi consisted of a simple length of rope at least  in length, featuring a sharp hooked blade at one end and a heavy iron ring at the other. Its functionalities closely resembled those of a standard chain weapon. The rope could be swung to attack using either the blade or the weight, used to entangle by swiftly wrapping it around the feet or arms, employed as a throwing weapon similar to bolas, or held while striking with the knife. Although the rope was more susceptible to being cut or broken compared to a chain, it remained a preferred choice among ninjas due to its near-silent operation. Its ease of concealment made it common to wear as a belt or underneath a sash."
