The Hand of Bane was an artifact created by the Banite priesthood to enable Bane to be resurrected, should the need arise.
The hand was hidden in the city of Sigil, in a former temple to Bane.
The hand was carved from black obsidian, about the size of an ogres paw. The fingers were curled upwards, with fingernails of red garnet. The hand was also studded with diamonds, giving it a poxy appearance.
The hand was destroyed by Walinda, a priestess of Bane, in the Astral Plane. The pieces were later scattered throughout the planes by Holly Harrowslough and Joel.
