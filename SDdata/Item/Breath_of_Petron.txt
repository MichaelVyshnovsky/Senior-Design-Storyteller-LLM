The '''Breath of Petron''' was a powerful [[dragonborn]] [[artifact]].

==Description==
The Breath of Petron was a flute that looked like a root made of red stone, branching in at least six different directions into finer tubes.

==Abilities==
The Breath of Petron granted those who played it the power to control elemental [[air]], [[Earth (element)|earth]], and lightning. The artifact demanded a price for its use, however, turning the lungs of those who played it into crystal. 

==History==
The Breath of Petron was a piece of the lungs of a [[primordial]] named [[Petron]]. This artifact was made by a slave dragonborn named [[Haizverad]], who stole a small part of the remains of Petron collected by the [[dragon]] [[Versveshardinazar]].

After the [[Spellplague]], the dragonborn survivors of [[Tymanchebar]] used the Breath of Petron to construct [[Djerad Thymar]], by lifting and fusing the remains of the capital ''djerad'' of Tymanchebar, the ruins of the God-Tomb of [[Nanna-Sin]], and rocks from the [[Smoking Mountains]]. Since then, the artifact was guarded by members of [[Clan Shestandeliath]].

The Breath of Petron was used again, in [[Hammer 9]] of [[1487 DR]], by [[Shestandeliath Geshthax]] in order to create an earth barrier to protect Djerad Thymar against the advancing [[Unther]]ite led by [[Gilgeam]].
