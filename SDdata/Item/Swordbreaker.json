        "mainbody": "Swordbreaker weapons, also known as clabbards, were serrated swords that varied in size, from dagger or sunder opponents blades and shields.\nSwordbreakers many shapes could also have several types of serrations on on side of the blades. Greatsword swordbreakers possessed serrated edges that resembled a saw, ripping and sawing through wood and leather with effortless savagery. \nLongsword swordbreakers were medium-sized weapons with thicker and deeper metal teeth on one side of the blade. They were usually forged out of tempered steel and were used in dueling and gladiatorial battles.\nKnife, or dagger swordbreakers were short, wide, and heavy noted blades, sometimes dual-wielded. Same could be said about short sword swordbreakers. They were wielded in off-hand and used to patty and trap opponents blades in  between the tines.\n*Swordbreaker knives were in use in Selgaunt, Sembia.\n*Short sword swordbreakers were in use in the Blade Kingdoms, notably in the city-states of Colletro and Sumbria. They saw use in dueling as an off-hand weapon.\n*Gilberto Il√©go the Blade Captain from Colletro, the Blade Kingdoms circa 1217 DR.\n*Vox the personal guard of Thamalon Uskevren II, nobleman from Selgaunt, Sembia circa 1373 DR, who dual-wielded his swordbreaker knives in close combat with masterful finesse."
