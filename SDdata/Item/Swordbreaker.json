Greatsword swordbreakers possessed serrated edges that resembled a saw, ripping and sawing through wood and leather with effortless savagery. \nLongsword swordbreakers were medium-sized weapons with thicker and deeper metal teeth on one side of the blade. They were usually forged out of tempered steel and were used in dueling and gladiatorial battles.\nKnife, or dagger swordbreakers were short, wide, and heavy noted blades, sometimes dual-wielded. Same could be said about short sword swordbreakers. They were wielded in off-hand and used to patty and trap opponents blades in  between the tines.\n*Swordbreaker knives were in use in Selgaunt, Sembia.\n*Short sword swordbreakers were in use in the Blade Kingdoms, notably in the city-states of Colletro and Sumbria.
