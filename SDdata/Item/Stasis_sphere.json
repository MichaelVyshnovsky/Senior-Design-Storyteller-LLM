        "mainbody": "The stasis sphere was a magical item. When touched by its owner and commanded, one nearby creature could be placed in temporal stasis and confined inside the sphere, similar to the imprisonment spell.\nThe sphere was a greenish and glowing sphere made of crystal, around 8 feet (2.4 meters) in diameter and weighing 1000 pounds (453 kilograms). Inside the sphere, there was an extra-dimensional space in which as many as fifty creatures could be confined. With a second command, a creature could be freed. Once the sphere has been used fifty times, it could no longer confine new creatures.\nIt was created in the age of Netheril.\nIt was used by Telkoun Adranther in the Telkouns Tower for his creepy experiments."
