Other flatbreads found in Baldur's Gate (and other large cities, like Waterdeep) included regional varieties from Calimshan, Silverymoon, and Tethyr. Calishite flatbreads were topped with olives and [[pistachio]]s, Tethyrean – with cheese and herbs and consumed with a glass of good wine, and flatbreads from Silverymoon were sugary dessert dishes made with cinnamon.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-04-10/Flatbreads in Calimshan and Ruathym}}\n*Flatbreads could be found in the town of [[Shadowdale]], as well as in [[Phlan]] and the wider [[Moonsea]], where it was sometimes purchased as part of travelers' provisions alongside [[flour]], [[salt]], [[jerky]], [[dried fruit]], [[sugar]], and [[lard]].\n*The dish called [[Three Crabs]] was served on a platter of two toasted flatbread loaves in the [[Singing Sprite]] inn in [[Secomber]].
