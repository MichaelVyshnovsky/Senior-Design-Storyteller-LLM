The Rod of Auglad was a fabled possession of Ilitmur Auglad. As of the late 14 century DR, it had yet to be found.
The Rod was believed to have been hidden somewhere in Procalith by the Magister Nasana Melnuthquel, who had once been the lover of Ilitmur Auglad. Many adventurers had searched through the ruins of Procalith looking for it.
