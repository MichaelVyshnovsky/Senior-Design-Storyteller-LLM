        "mainbody": "'''''Boots of Varied Tracks''''' were ordinary-looking boots that allowed the wearer to alter the tracks they left behind.",
        "Powers": "The wearer could change the size of their footprints to ones as small as a [[halfling]]'s to as large as an [[ogre]]'s, shoed or barefooted. Each set of boots also had four extra types of tracks it could leave, ranging from common animals such as [[wolves]] and [[horse]]s to [[basilisk]]s and [[hill giant]]s."
