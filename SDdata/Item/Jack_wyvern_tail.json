        "mainbody": "ack wyvern tail, also known as Jacks wyvern tail and sometimes old wyvern tail, was a Cormyrean dish designed to imitate the taste and texture of the meat from the tail of a wyvern.\nThe dish was a blend of chopped pork, turkey, and rabbit meat. It had to be prepared carefully to approximate the succulence of true wyvern meat, but was not a perfect substitute. It was eaten either as a hot entree or as cold slices with bread.\nThe same spices traditionally used when preparing wyvern tail were used in the preparation of jack wyvern tail, sometimes including asparagus broth and almonds.\nWith a decline in the population of wyverns in the Stonelands as of the midâ€“14 century DR, jack wyvern tail grew in popularity as real wyvern tail became harder to acquire in Cormyr.\nThe Old Oyster restaurant in Monksblade was famous for its \"old wyvern tail\", which was made with a secret recipe and served in the size and shape of a wyverns tail with skin made of crispy pork crackling. It was served over a bed of fried potatoes covered in mushroom-cream sauce, and was big enough for four full meals."
