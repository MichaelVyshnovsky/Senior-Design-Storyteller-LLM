        "mainbody": "'''Jack wyvern tail''', also known as '''Jack's wyvern tail''' and sometimes '''old wyvern tail''', was a [[Cormyr]]ean dish designed to imitate the taste and texture of the meat from the tail of a [[wyvern]].",
        "Description": "The dish was a blend of chopped [[pork]], [[turkey]], and [[rabbit]] meat. It had to be prepared carefully to approximate the succulence of true wyvern meat, but was not a perfect substitute. It was eaten either as a hot entree or as cold slices with [[bread]].\n\nThe same [[spice]]s traditionally used when preparing wyvern tail were used in the preparation of jack wyvern tail, sometimes including [[asparagus]] broth and [[almond]]s.",
        "Availability": "With a decline in the population of wyverns in the [[Stonelands]] as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], jack wyvern tail grew in popularity as real wyvern tail became harder to acquire in Cormyr.\n\nThe [[Old Oyster]] restaurant in [[Monksblade]] was famous for its \"old wyvern tail\", which was made with a secret recipe and served in the size and shape of a wyvern's tail with skin made of crispy [[pork rind|pork crackling]]. It was served over a bed of fried [[potato]]es covered in [[mushroom]]-[[cream]] sauce, and was big enough for four full meals."
