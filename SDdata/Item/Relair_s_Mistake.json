        "mainbody": "'''Relair's Mistake''' was a [[magic]]al cloak that allowed the wearer to transform themself into a [[wolf]] for a limited amount of time.",
        "Powers": "At will, the wearer of this cloak could transform themself into a wolf for a duration of two minutes.",
        "History": "This cloak was crafted by the [[mage]] [[Relair]], and named for the folly of his hubris. Relair believed himself to have more control over [[arcane magic]] than he actually possessed and, while crafting it, he inflicted himself with [[lycanthropy]]. Despite the inherent power of the garment, Relair was unable to change his form as he so pleased.\n\nAt some point before [[1368 DR]], the cloak was stashed away in a cave on the [[Sword Coast]], just a ways south of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
