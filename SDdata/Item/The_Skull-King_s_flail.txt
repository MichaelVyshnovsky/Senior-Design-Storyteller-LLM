'''''The Skull-King's flail''''' was the unique [[enchanted]] [[Abyss]]al [[flail]] that belonged to [[Quah-Nomag]] the Skull-King, infamous [[priest]] of [[Orcus]].

==Powers==
This dreaded light flail was imbued with a potent ''+4'' enchantment. Its hammer was forged to deal additional bludgeoning and ''[[negative energy]]'' damage. Additionally, ''the Skull-King's flail'' allowed its wielder to cast the ''[[inflict serious wounds]]'' spell once per day. The weapons held nine charges of that spell.

==History==
Quah-Nomag carried ''the Skull-King's flail'' into the battle between his master Orcus and the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] in [[1373 DR]]. This vicious flail took the lives of many Zhent civilians and defenders until the onslaught was stopped by the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. Quah-Nomag and his demonic troops were broken by the adventurers, and soon after he was slain by the heroes during Orcus' last stand against [[Fzoul Chembryl]]. With the demons sent back to the Abyss, ''the Skull-King's flail'' was left behind on the battlefield in the Temple of [[Bane]].
