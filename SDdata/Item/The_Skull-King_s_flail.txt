The Skull-Kings flail was the unique enchanted Abyssal flail that belonged to Quah-Nomag the Skull-King, infamous priest of Orcus.
This dreaded light flail was imbued with a potent +4 enchantment. Its hammer was forged to deal additional bludgeoning and negative energy damage. Additionally, the Skull-Kings flail allowed its wielder to cast the inflict serious wounds spell once per day. The weapons held nine charges of that spell.
Quah-Nomag carried the Skull-Kings flail into the battle between his master Orcus and the city of Zhentil Keep in 1373 DR. This vicious flail took the lives of many Zhent civilians and defenders until the onslaught was stopped by the Hero of Daggerford. Quah-Nomag and his demonic troops were broken by the adventurers, and soon after he was slain by the heroes during Orcus last stand against Fzoul Chembryl. With the demons sent back to the Abyss, the Skull-Kings flail was left behind on the battlefield in the Temple of Bane.
