The '''Pandemonium Stone''' was an ancient and extremely powerful [[artifact]] that existed in the [[Elemental Chaos]].

==Description==
The Pandemonium Stone was a spire more than five hundred feet (152 meters) tall and more than one hundred feet (30 meters) in diameter. The spire was made of bone, flesh, ice, minerals, wind, wood, and other materials that were in a constant state of change. It was roughly hewn, and fire, lightning, thunder, and extreme cold flared and cropped up around the structure intermittently and randomly. Sometimes intense white runes in an unknown script crawled across its surface.

The Pandemonium Stone manifested randomly across the Elemental Chaos, popping into existence in a powerful eruption of various types of energies at different places and points of time. When the spire appeared, it called to the [[slaad]]s, who gathered around it to bathe in its energy. 

==History==
[[Faerûn]]ian sages were unsure of the Pandemonium Stone's origins. Some believed the structure contained a sleeping and immensely powerful slaad lord. Others speculated that it was a [[batrachi]] artifact, and studied it to prove whether or not slaads were related to that
amphibious progenitor race. The [[Deity|gods]] and [[primordial]]s themselves claimed not to have crafted it, although they knew of its existence since before the [[Dawn War]].

After the [[Spellplague]], the primordial [[Bazim-Gorag]] claimed the Pandemonium Stone as his domain, and went to the places where the Pandemonium Stone appeared for longer periods of time to exert his influence over other slaads.
