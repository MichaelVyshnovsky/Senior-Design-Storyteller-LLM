        "Description": "These enchanted thuribles were made out of [[gold]] and covered with arcane scripts etched into the surface. These words translated to prayers to [[Akadi]], the Queen of Air.",
        "Powers": "When fulled with incense and lit, such ''censer'' summoned an [[air elemental]] under the summoner's control. This ritual could be performed once per day. If magical ''[[incense of meditation]]'' was used with these thuribles, an [[elder air elemental]] was summoned. Each ''censer of controlling air elementals'' could only summon one creature at a time. The summoned air elemental could be ''[[Dispelling|dispelled]]'' with spells or dismissed by its summoner.",
        "Creation": "A skilled crafter of wondrous items could create similar censers with the use of ''[[summon monster VI]]'' and ''[[summon monster IX]]'' spells.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], several powerful magical items were brought to [[Toril]] by a planeswalking [[wizard]] [[Vejoni H. Wyzz]] who pitched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of [[Liam's Hold]]. ''Censers of controlling air elementals'' could be found in his collection.",
        "Notable Users": "*[[Bahamut]]'s divine powers allowed him to create various enchanted items, including ''censers of controlling air elementals''."
