These words translated to prayers to Akadi, the Queen of Air.\nWhen fulled with incense and lit, such censer summoned an air elemental under the summoners control. This ritual could be performed once per day. If magical incense of meditation was used with these thuribles, an elder air elemental was summoned. Each censer of controlling air elementals could only summon one creature at a time. The summoned air elemental could be dispelled with spells or dismissed by its summoner.\nA skilled crafter of wondrous items could create similar censers with the use of summon monster VI and summon monster IX spells.\nCirca 1372 DR, several powerful magical items were brought to Toril by a planeswalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz who pitched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of Liams Hold. Censers of controlling air elementals could be found in his collection.\n*Bahamuts divine powers allowed him to create various enchanted items, including censers of controlling air elementals."
