        "mainbody": "The Heart of the Lion was a holy relic that could be found in the fortress of Sarahin in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThe Heart of the Lion was actually a carnelian of bright red coloration. The stone was large, measuring at least a foot across.\nCasting detect magic upon the stone would cause it to radiate strong necromantic magic. This occurred because Akim al-Kalaas used the stone as the receptacle for his lifeproof spell. Akim tasked his personal dao servant to kill anyone who lifted a finger against the stone.\nThree smaller fragments sat beside the Heart of the Lion on the sacred altar of the Lions Shrine. If held by devout followers of Hajama, these fragments granted them the ability to use bless, cloak of bravery, cure disease, dispel evil, and heal.\nThe founder of the Everlasting was said to have ripped the Heart from the body of the Lion of Suja.\nCategoryArtifacts\nCategoryGems\nCategoryCarnelian items\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryHajamite items\nCategoryItems from Sarahin\nCategoryItems from the Haunted Lands\nCategoryItems from Interior Zakhara\nCategoryItems from Zakhara\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nmodu4f8jwqptacu4gqae9xvjw6z2v95"
