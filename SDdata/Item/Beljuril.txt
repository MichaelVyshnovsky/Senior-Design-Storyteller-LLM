'''Beljurils''', also known as '''fireflashils''' or '''fireflashes''', were gemstones only known to exist in the Realms and highly prized for their unusual properties.{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|20}} These jewels were found in ancient rock formations, usually in blue claystone. They also occurred in [[beljuril dragon]] lairs.<ref>{{Cite dragon/265/Earthstokers|43}}

==Description==
Beljurils were a deep seawater green with a smooth surface, and all known specimens were roughly the size of a [[human]] fist approximately 3 to 5 in (8 to 13 cm) in diameter and not quite spherical. warning beacons, or nightlights for the extremely wealthy. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 [[gp]].

==Powers==
About once every hour<ref group="note">The original ''[[Dragon magazine 72|Dragon #72]]'' says "per turn", which in 1{{st}} edition D&D terms was 10 minutes. (rates varied from stone to stone and did not seem correlated with size or age) a beljuril absorbed an undetectable amount of energy (heat, light, and vibratory) from within a 30 ft (10 m) radius and re-emitted that energy as a flash of light without heat or sound but with a few very mild sparks of electrical discharge. The light produced was easily noticeable when the ambient light was dim (candlelight or lantern light) and in the dark it was dazzling to the eye.

[[Alchemist]]s, artisans, and sages attempted to harness beljurils as a power source, but none were known to have succeeded. This stone's affinity for electrical energy made it highly desirable as a component in making ''[[wand of lightning|wands of lightning]]'' and other items that cast [[:Category:Electricity spells|electricity spells]]&mdash;shards of beljuril affixed to the tip increased the power of the wand or made it harder to resist, depending on the nature of the spell. Likewise, powdered beljuril was used in [[ink]] for inscribing such spells and in magical immersions to enchant items that collected or conducted electricity.

==Reputation==
Beljurils were considered prized gems among the drow but their use as decoration was limited to important places like a [[wizard]]s' tower, temple approaches, or the temples themselves except for the ones of [[Lolth]]. For example, temples to [[Vhaeraun]] had a ceiling, which was studded with beljurils to look like a starry sky.

==Rumors & Legends==
A [[dwarven]] legend told around the southwestern region of [[the Vast]] asserted the existence of a natural cavern somewhere northwest of [[High Haspur]] whose walls, floor, and ceiling were encrusted with thousands of beljurils. The legend was unspecific about how to access the cave or what may have been guarding it, but warned that all who sought the cave vanished entirely or were found dead with a single beljuril stuffed into his or her mouth.
