        "Powers": "''Drakulwyng'' possessed a powerful ''+4'' enchantment to the damage dealt, and that guided the weapon towards its targets. It also enhanced the wielder's fortitude, charisma, and physical strength. Additionally, ''Drakulwyng'' held four charges of the ''[[vampiric touch]]'' [[spell]] that the wielder could cast at will.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Drakulwyng'' was excavated by agents of the [[drow]] [[House Freth]] who allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in order to rod the ruined city of Myth Drannor of its ancient magics buried in the [[Weeping War]]. The scimitar was locked away in the armory of House Freth within the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]]."
