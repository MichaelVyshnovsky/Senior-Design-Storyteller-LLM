        "Description": "Trathake was a popular food in busy Khôltar because it could be purchased quickly at a blurdren (local food counter) and eaten while walking or working. The basic dish was a [[bread]] bun partially hollowed out and filled with meat, then sealed with melted [[cheese]] (usually spiced with pepper). One of the worst examples of trathake cost 2 [[copper piece]]s each at [[Mother Talasko's]] where they used the fried guts of various animals on the hoof for the \"meat\". Better quality versions at other establishments generally cost a copper or two more."
