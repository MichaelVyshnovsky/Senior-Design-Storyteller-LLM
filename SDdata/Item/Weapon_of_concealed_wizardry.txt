A '''''weapon of concealed wizardry''''' referred to any type of magic weapon where the enchantments were undetectable by magical means. These weapons originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Powers==
A ''weapon of concealed wizardry'' could have the enchantment of any other magic weapon found on [[Toril|Al-Toril]]. Additionally, casting ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', ''[[identify]]'', and similar spells, revealed nothing about the weapon's magical nature.

[[Rawun]]s and [[barber]]s were able to use their special skills to determine the basic magical nature of these weapons.
