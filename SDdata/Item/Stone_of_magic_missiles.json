        "mainbody": "A '''''stone of magic missiles''''' was a rare magical weapon.",
        "Description": "It was a featureless, white oval stone akin to a hen's egg, able to fill an entire human palm. Faint sparkles coalesced around it from time to time, soon fading.",
        "Powers": "Upon grasping the stone, any sapient creature was instantly aware its purpose was to emit harmful bolts of magic, up to four a minute, in the manner of the ''[[magic missile]]'' spell. However, those who didn't cast spells could only fire off one at a time, instead of four. It could operate up to four minutes at a time, thrice a day; if operated a fourth time, it would stop working for about two weeks, or maybe just under two and a half tendays.",
        "History": "[[Talatha Vaerovree]] kept such a stone hidden in [[Castle Endreth]], where another [[Magister]] had hidden it.",
