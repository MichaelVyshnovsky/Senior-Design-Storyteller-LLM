        "mainbody": "'''Drow knockout poison''', also called '''drow sleep poison''' or simply '''drow poison''', was a [[poison]] often used by the [[drow]].",
        "Description": "The drow sleep poison was a black, gummy, and heavy substance like molasses.",
        "Powers": "The drow poison was delivered by injury and was used by smearing it on ranged weapons like [[crossbow]] bolts, [[dart]]s, or [[javelin]]s, on other weapons, or&mdash;in extreme cases&mdash; on the bare hand. It was a potent poison but reacted to air and [[sun]]light. Exposure to air caused it to lose potency in 60 days, while keeping it in a sealed packet kept it potent for years. Exposure to sunlight had an extreme effect, causing it to lose its potency in an instant.\n\nThe poison was delivered by injury or, in the case of delivery via bare hand, by hitting nose, eyes, mouth, or an existing wound. A weapon could deliver the poison twice with the same dose smeared on it, but the potency lessened on the second strike. Drow on assassination missions applied this poison on garrotes or fingernail polish. Slave-holding areas or drow camps outside of civilized [[Underdark]] environments were secured with tripwire traps that were poisoned with this.\n\nWhen the drow poison was delivered into a creature's system, the creature felt weakness and lassitude before Once that happened, ''[[dispel magic]]'' or physical attempts to awaken the victim did not work. An application of ''[[neutralize poison]]'', a [[potion]] of ''[[sweet water]]'', or ''[[vitality]]'' worked perfectly.\n\nOne safe way to wash off a poisoned weapon was to apply alcohol on it.\n\nIt took four days to create the drow knockout poison when the creator had access to a functional laboratory.",
        "History": "As the name suggested, drow knockout poison was a poison associated with the drow. They often used it on subterranean ambushes",
        "Reputation": "The production of this poison was a closely held secret among the drow. Therefore, it was hard to find a source of it on the surface and in the Underdark where the drow were not in power."
