        "Description": "''Foestriker'' was a large [[battle axe]].",
        "Powers": "This weapon carried a stout ''+4'' [[enchantment]]. ''Foestriker'' behaved like a ''[[dwarven thrower]]'' when held by Uthgar, circling back to his hands through the air when used as a ranged weapon. The hammer could never be physically harmed or removed from Uthgar's hand without his consent. The weapon was particularly harmful when used against [[giant]]s and [[giant-kin]]."
