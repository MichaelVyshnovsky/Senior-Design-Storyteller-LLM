        "mainbody": "oestriker was a unique melee weapon wielded by the avatar of Uthgar, the Father of the Uthgardt.\nFoestriker was a large battle axe.\nThis weapon carried a stout +4 enchantment. Foestriker behaved like a dwarven thrower when held by Uthgar, circling back to his hands through the air when used as a ranged weapon. The hammer could never be physically harmed or removed from Uthgars hand without his consent. The weapon was particularly harmful when used against giants and giant-kin."
