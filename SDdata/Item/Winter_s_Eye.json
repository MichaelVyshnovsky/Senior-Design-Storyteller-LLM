        "mainbody": "The Winters Eye was an enchanted longsword of frost that appeared to be aflame. The sword belonged to the commander of the Cult of the Dragon named Ellis circa 1369 DR.\nWinters Eye was an enchanted +2 longsword of frost that was enspelled with multiple sets of the continual flame as a joke. The constantly flaming sword did not burn upon hit, instead freezing its opponents. The sword also often tricked Ellis opponents into using magics that made them resistant to flames, which of course, was useless against Winters Eye.\nBlades similar to Winters Eye could be forged by experienced crafters of magic arms and armor using the spells of chill metal or ice storm, and three charges of the continual flame spell.\nIn 1369 DR, Ellis and his branch of the Cult of the Dragon were occupying the ruins of Myth Drannor, making base in the Castle Cormanthor. Winters Eye was kept on Ellis self during the day, and in his quarters in the Castle Cormanthors sub-levels at night."
