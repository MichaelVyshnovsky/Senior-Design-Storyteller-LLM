An amulet of animal control was an enchanted amulet that granted the wearer control over animals.
These amulets granted the wearer complete control over a single giant animal or up to six smaller ones at a time. The amulet had no effect upon magical beasts or intelligent animals. The wearers control over the animals lasted as long as they maintained concentration, once the control was broken the animals were free to react or behave as they wished.
Janci al-Kriman, a camel trader in Huzuz, wore an amulet of animal control.
