        "mainbody": "bsul Ssussun, or \"The Door to Light\", was a spellbook containing some spells designed for followers of Vhaeraun.\nThe black book was small, about as wide as an elfs hand, and written in Undercommon in small Elven script.\nIt was written by the Widower in cooperation with a cleric of Vhaeraun alongside another book. Both books were made twice, one for arcane casters and another for divine casters.\nIt had a spiritual value to the church of Vhaeraun, who were known to buy back the book for a heavy sum. Clan Auzkovyn also provided the seller with a token for life-long safe passage.\nAs mentioned above, the book was written by the Widower in cooperation with a cleric of Vhaeraun sometime between 1370 DR and 1372 DR and two copies, each for arcane and divine magic, existed.\nWhen the Widower left, he gave it to his secondwizard Zulifein Torgh in order that it be used in the fight against Lolth. Zulifein didnt follow instructions however, and disappeared towards Sshamath at some point in 1372 DR, intending to use the book to buy his safety there. What happened to the book, at least its arcane version, after that is unknown.\nThe book contained three notable spells and the secret to calling for the aid of a vhaerath. The spells were\n* Elf disguise\n* Soul charge\n* Vhaerauns nightshield\nCategorySpellbooks\nCategoryBooks (in-universe)\nCategoryArcane books (in-universe)\nCategoryItems from Cormanthor\nCategoryItems from Interior Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\ne2msxv1hhor7phnob049pote2bs3t8u"
