        "Description": "The black book was small, about as wide as an [[elf]]'s hand, and written in [[Undercommon]] in small [[Espruar|Elven script]].",
        "Versions": "It was written by [[the Widower]] in cooperation with a [[cleric]] of [[Vhaeraun]] alongside another book. Both books were made twice, one for arcane casters and another for divine casters.",
        "Value": "It had a spiritual value to the [[church of Vhaeraun]], who were known to buy back the book for a heavy sum. [[Clan Auzkovyn]] also provided the seller with a token for life-long safe passage.",
        "History": "As mentioned above, the book was written by [[the Widower]] in cooperation with a cleric of [[Vhaeraun]] sometime between [[1370 DR]] and [[1372 DR]] and two copies, each for arcane and divine magic, existed.\n\nWhen the Widower left, he gave it to his secondwizard [[Zulifein T'orgh]] in order that it be used in the fight against [[Lolth]]. Zulifein didn't follow instructions however, and disappeared towards [[Sshamath]] at some point in 1372 DR, intending to use the book to buy his safety there. What happened to the book, at least its arcane version, after that is unknown.",
        "Contents": "The book contained three notable spells and the secret to calling for the aid of a [[vhaerath]]. The spells were:\n* ''[[Elf disguise]]''\n* ''[[Soul charge]]''\n* ''[[Vhaeraun's nightshield]]''",
