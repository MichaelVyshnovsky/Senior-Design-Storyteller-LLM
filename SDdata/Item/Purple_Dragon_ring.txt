A purple dragon ring was a brass ring inscribed with the purple dragon symbol of the Obarskyr royal family of Cormyr, and they were usually worn by the Purple Dragons to protect the royal family from harm. In 1372 DR, it was reported that over 4,000 of these rings had been made.
An individual had to be wearing such a ring to enter an area protected by a ring ward.
The ring had the ability to produce magical light in a  sphere up to  away. This light source lasted ten minutes and could not be turned off except by dispelling of some sort.
The ring could also be activated to detect poison in gases, liquids, and solids that it came into contact with. It glowed a golden-green color if poison was present.
While activated, it would also glow bright blue if placed in contact with anything carrying a magical enchantment.
If this ring was worn on the same hand as a commanders ring, they were treated as wearing only one ring.
These rings were valued at 2,125 gold pieces each. Other reports record their value at around 4,000 gold pieces.
