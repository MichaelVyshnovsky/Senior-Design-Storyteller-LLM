A '''''purple dragon ring''''' was a [[brass]] ring inscribed with the purple dragon symbol of the [[Obarskyr]] royal family of [[Cormyr]], and they were usually worn by the [[Purple Dragons]] to protect the royal family from harm. In [[1372 DR]], it was reported that over 4,000 of these rings had been made.

An individual had to be wearing such a ring to enter an area protected by a ''[[ring ward]]''.

==Powers==
The ring had the ability to produce magical ''[[light]]'' in a {{SIAdj|10|ft}} sphere up to {{SI|40|ft}} away. This light source lasted ten minutes and could not be turned off except by ''[[dispel magic|dispelling]]'' of some sort.

The ring could also be activated to ''[[detect poison]]'' in gases, liquids, and solids that it came into contact with. It glowed a golden-green color if poison was present.

While activated, it would also glow bright blue if placed in contact with anything carrying a magical enchantment.

If this ring was worn on the same hand as a ''[[commander's ring]]'', they were treated as wearing only one ring.

==Value==
These rings were valued at 2,125 [[gold piece]]s each. Other reports record their value at around 4,000 gold pieces.

==Known Owners or Users==
* [[Mirt the Moneylender]]<ref>
* [[Bardanther Uleeyon]], who went missing during the heist of [[Waevor's Wagon]] in [[1227 DR]].{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|78}}
* [[Faril Laheralson]], garrison leader in [[Thunderstone]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].
* [[Purple Dragons]]: Ranks of [[lionar]] and above would normally have one of these rings.

==Missing Rings==
One of these rings went missing along with its owner, Bardanther Uleeyon, in 1227 DR. As of the 1370s DR, it was believed that only three of these rings were unaccounted for.
