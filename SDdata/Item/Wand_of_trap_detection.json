        "Description": "''Wands of trap detection'' were usually slender and ebon in appearance.",
        "Powers": "Once activated, a ''wand of trap detection'' allowed the user to see all [[trap]]s within the caster's eyesight. Each wand could be used only once a day.",
        "History": "The most famous ''wand of trap detection'' once belonged to a [[half-elven]] [[wizard]]-[[rogue]] [[Illep the Watchful]] from [[Myth Drannor]]. He used the wand in his numerous burglaries to see snares and deadly springblades. Illep's illicit career was cut short by an unruly warrior [[Brammel]] who was offended by the half-elf's dandified appearance. In ensued tavern brawl, Illep died of an [[axe]] wound. Brammel was arrested, and the foppish thieve's belongings, with the ''wand of trap detection'', were sent to his relatives in [[Myth Drannor]]. Bandits attacked the caravan that was transporting Illep's belongings, and the ''wand'' became lost to history.\n\nThe ''wand'' resurfaced again in [[1281 DR]], just outside [[Kuldahar]] in [[Icewind Dale]], at a ruined mill in the [[Kuldahar Pass]], ransacked by marauding [[goblin]]s."
