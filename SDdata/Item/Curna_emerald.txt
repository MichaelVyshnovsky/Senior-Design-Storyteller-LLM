Curna emeralds were rare gemstones found in the Shining Lands.
These beautiful clear emeralds held turquoise light in their center. They were so named not only because they could be found only within the Curna Mountains, but also because the Gemstone chaka—who first discovered the emeralds—were devout worshipers of Curna.
The gemstones were rare and prized as of 1367 DR.
