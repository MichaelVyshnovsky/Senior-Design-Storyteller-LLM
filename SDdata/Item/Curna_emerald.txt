'''Curna emeralds''' were rare gemstones found in the [[Shining Lands]].

==Description==
These beautiful clear [[emerald]]s held turquoise light in their center. They were so named not only because they could be found only within the [[Curna Mountains]], but also because the [[Gemstone chaka]]—who first discovered the emeralds—were devout worshipers of [[Curna]].

==History==
The gemstones were rare and prized as of [[1367 DR]].
