The halberd of swift admonition was a unique enchanted halberd crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Nayeli Goldflower in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
Silverhand crafted the halberd to honor Nayelis "gift of perspective" given her ability to recognize all actors who fell within the purview of her revenge mission, including those who supported or benefitted from her enemies actions.
