'''''Woundwulf''''' was an enchanted [[longsword]] of likely [[elf|elven]] origins from the depths of the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]].

==Description==
This expensive-looking longsword had an intricately detailed head of a [[wolf]] on its hilt.

==Powers==
''Woundwulf'' possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment; it enhanced the owner's strength and improved their fortitude. Additionally, ''Woundwulf'' allowed the wielder to siphon the target's life force, similar to the ''[[vampiric touch]]'' spell. The blade had five charges of the magical draining effect.

==History==
''Woundwulf'' dated back to ancient [[Myth Drannor]]. The longsword was among many magical artifacts that became interred along with countless elven heroes of the City of Song under Castle Cormanthor. By [[1369 DR]], the owner of the blade was wandering the halls of the ancient catacombs as a master [[wight]], surrounded by several [[mohrg]]s. The undead carried ''Woundwulf'' and another powerful enchanted weapon, ''[[Wroth's Executioner]]''.
