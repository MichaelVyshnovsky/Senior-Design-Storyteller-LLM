        "mainbody": "Shortspears were a simple, one-handed melee or thrown weapon.\nAs the name implied, shortspears were a shorter variety of spears. Typically, they had a straight shaft made of wood, either sharpened to a point or tipped with a spearhead fashioned to perform a specific function. The spearhead could be made of iron, bronze, steel, flint, obsidian, rock crystal, ivory, coral, or other material as suited to the job. Their shafts were typically shorter than a quarterstaff and usually of smaller diameter than a regular spear, especially if intended to be thrown.\nShortspears were small and light enough to wield in one hand and required very little training to thrust it into or at an opponent.\n* Shortspears were considered a favored weapon of the god Annam All-Father.\n* Spirit shamans were typically known to be proficient in the use of shortspears."
