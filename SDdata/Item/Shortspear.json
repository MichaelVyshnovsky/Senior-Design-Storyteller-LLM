        "mainbody": "'''Shortspears''' were a simple, one-handed melee or thrown weapon.",
        "Description": "As the name implied, shortspears were a shorter variety of [[spear]]s. Typically, they had a straight shaft made of wood, either sharpened to a point or tipped with a spearhead fashioned to perform a specific function. The spearhead could be made of [[iron]], [[bronze]], [[steel]], [[flint]], [[obsidian]], [[rock crystal]], [[ivory]], [[coral]], or other material as suited to the job. Their shafts were typically shorter than a [[quarterstaff]] and usually of smaller diameter than a regular spear, especially if intended to be thrown.",
        "Weaponology": "Shortspears were small and light enough to wield in one hand and required very little training to thrust it into or at an opponent.",
        "Notable Owners": {
            "Individuals": "* Shortspears were considered a favored weapon of the god [[Annam All-Father]].",
            "Groups": "* [[Spirit shaman]]s were typically known to be proficient in the use of shortspears."
