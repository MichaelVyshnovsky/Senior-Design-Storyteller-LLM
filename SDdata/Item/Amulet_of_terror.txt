An amulet of terror was a handglyph used by the Geomancers of Kadar.
This amulet cloaked the wielder in a purple aura of awful power. Anyone within a  radius of the wielder would be frozen in terror and unable to perform any other actions for several minutes.
Most amulets of terror had between 20â€”50 charges.
These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes.
