        "Powers": "Enhanced with ''+1'' enchantment, these sets of mail, granted the wearer uncanny focus when casting ''[[conjuration]]'', ''[[divination]]'', ''[[enchantment]]'', and ''[[evocation]]'' spells.",
        "History": "Even though majority of elves prefer wearing [[Category:Light armor|light armor]] sets such as ''[[elven chainmail]]s'', these ceremonial plates were masterfully crafted and offered solid defense. By late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''elven ceremonial armor'' could be found on the [[Sword Coast]] as well as the [[Moonsea]] regions."
