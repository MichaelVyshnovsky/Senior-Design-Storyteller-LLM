        "Powers": "This grim visage was detrimental to the wearer's appearance. However, the ''Lichskull'' gave the wearer a dramatically increased ability to concentrate and weave more potent [[spell]]s. Additionally, the wearer received significant resistance to [[magic]]. The item's magic made it only usable by [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, [[red dragon disciple]]s, and [[pale master]]s.",
        "History": "''Lichskull'' was the creation of the [[arch-mage]] named [[Cledos]], crafted some years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. The wizard's loyal assistant, the half-orc [[Hans Kludgen]], was tasked with traveling across [[Toril]] in search of the rarest [[arcane]] [[material component]]s for his master. But his travels and tireless work were rewarded with decapitation. Hans unwittingly provided one last rare arcane component for Cledos, who, through a rare ritual, transformed the half-orc's skull into the ''Lichskull''.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}},  the helmet found its way to the eastern nation of [[Rashemen]], where it was discovered in Shadow [[Mulsantir]], the city's dark [[Shadowfell]] echo."
