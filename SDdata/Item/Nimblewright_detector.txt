The '''''nimblewright detector''''' was a one of a kind device designed to locate [[nimblewright]]s that was created around the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.{{Waterdeep-time}}

==Description==
This device was made of [[copper]], measured {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length, had a trigger, and had an [[umbrella]] protrustion at its end. If one were to cast ''[[detect magic]]'' on it, they would find that it radiated an aura of [[divination]] magic.

==Powers==
Activating this device required holding down on its trigger. When active, the umbrella on the device would click, spin, and whir whenever it detected a nimblewright within {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} of it that wasn't its creator Nim. This clicking, spinning, and whirring would increasingly accelerate the closer one got to a nimblewright, reaching maximum velocity once the wielder was within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}.

==History==
This device was created around 1492 DR by [[Nim]], a nimblewright in the [[House of Inspired Hands]], after another nimblewright that it had created to ease its loneliness fled from the temple in confused terror. It was only after having created the device that Nim learned that they couldn't leave the temple grounds. A group of [[adventurer]]s later came to the temple due to these events and while there learned of Nim's plight, who proceeded to gift them his ''nimblewright detector'' and teach them how it worked.
