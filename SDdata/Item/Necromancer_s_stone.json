        "mainbody": "necromancers stone was a fist-sized black sapphire used in necromantic summonings.\nUnless it was being used, it had to be covered at all times with a magical cloth. Anyone sensitive to the arcane could feel its magical emanations when it was in close proximity.\nWhen uncovered, the gem would start pulsating, sending a summoning call to any undead in the area. It also helped in controlling more powerful undead, like mummies when that was the case, the stone started glowing with an eerie black-purple luminescence.\nWhen the imp Druzil sneaked into Barjins chambers, he started checking all of his belongings, among them, the necromancers stone. and also helped control a powerful mummy.\nThe stone was finally stolen by Druzil, who stepped into the flames of Barjins brazier and into the Abyss, abandoning the library until Barjin had things under control.\n* Barjin, a cleric of Talona who dabbled in wizardry, necromancy, and sorcery possessed one of these stones. However, Druzil, Aballisters familiar, took it with him when he left the Edificant Library."
