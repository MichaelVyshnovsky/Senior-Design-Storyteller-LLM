        "mainbody": "A '''necromancer's stone''' was a fist-sized [[black sapphire]] used in [[Necromancy|necromantic]] summonings.",
        "Powers": "Unless it was being used, it had to be covered at all times with a magical cloth. Anyone sensitive to the arcane could feel its magical emanations when it was in close proximity.\n\nWhen uncovered, the gem would start pulsating, sending a summoning call to any [[undead]] in the area. It also helped in controlling more powerful undead, like [[mummies]]; when that was the case, the stone started glowing with an eerie black-purple luminescence.",
        "History": "When the [[imp]] [[Druzil]] sneaked into [[Barjin]]'s chambers, he started checking all of his belongings, among them, the necromancer's stone. and also helped control a powerful [[mummy]].\n\nThe stone was finally stolen by Druzil, who stepped into the flames of Barjin's [[brazier]] and into the [[Abyss]], abandoning the library until Barjin had things under control.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Barjin, a [[cleric]] of [[Talona]] who dabbled in wizardry, necromancy, and sorcery possessed one of these stones. However, Druzil, [[Aballister Bonaduce|Aballister]]'s familiar, took it with him when he left the Edificant Library."
