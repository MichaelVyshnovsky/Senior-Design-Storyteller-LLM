        "mainbody": "he Leaves of Green was a divine spellbook and a holy book of Silvanus.\nIt appeared to be a flat oval-shaped piece of fissured dark gray bark with a triangle of three circles scratched on its inner surface. To change it to its true appearance, one of the names of Silvanus had to be spoken aloud while the speaker pressed on the wood inside all of the three rings. This made the bark grow into a book with pages that were lush, square, waxy green leaves. Each of its sixteen pages bore a single spell.\nIt contained the following spells\n* Barkskin\n* Briartangle\n* Changestaff\n* Control weather\n* Death chariot\n* Dispel magic\n* Entangle\n* Falling wall\n* Fireward\n* Goodberry\n* Hold plant\n* Jaws of the wolf\n* Liveoak\n* Manythorns\n* Moss skull\n* Mulch\n* Oakheart\n* Pass plant\n* Pass without trace\n* Plant door\n* Plant growth\n* Protection from lightning\n* Rainbow\n* Smoke ghost\n* Snare\n* Speak with plants\n* Starshine\n* Thorn spray\n* Transport via plants\n* Tree\n* Turn wood\n* Wall of thorns\nCategoryBooks (in-universe)\nCategorySpellbooks\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryArtifacts\nCategoryItems from Faer√ªn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nbqjng2r0lnjyfs50qj9yjezy6xhzqgm"
