        "mainbody": "The spellskins of Mhairshaulk were magic items associated with the ancient sarrukh realm of Mhairshaulk.\nThey were reputed to lie within the Crypt of Anthilar, the legendary secret lair of the lich Anthilar, Archmage of Untisczer, which was hidden in the mountains west of the Tashan Gap in the Tashalar. Hoping to recover the spellskins, many adventurers searched for it in the 14 century DR, but few, or none, were ever seen again by 1373 DR."
