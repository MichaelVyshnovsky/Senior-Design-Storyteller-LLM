        "mainbody": "The '''''spellskins of Mhairshaulk''''' were [[magic item]]s associated with the ancient [[sarrukh]] realm of [[Mhairshaulk]].\n\nThey were reputed to lie within the [[Crypt of Anthilar]], the legendary secret lair of the [[lich]] [[Anthilar]], Archmage of [[Untisczer]], which was hidden in the mountains west of the [[Tashan Gap]] in the [[Tashalar]]. Hoping to recover the ''spellskins'', many adventurers searched for it in the 14{{th}} century DR, but few, or none, were ever seen again by [[1373 DR]]."
