        "mainbody": "'''Ravenar''', also called [[wikipedia:en:schorl|schorl]], was a variety of [[tourmaline]] mainly in demand in the [[North Faerûn|North]], and less so in other lands.",
        "Description": "Ravenar occurred in long crystals like other varieties of tourmaline and was a solid gloss black. Ravenar was commonly used for inlay work on weapons and accouterments. Where it was popular, a typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 gp.",
        "Powers": "Ravenar, like all tourmalines, could absorb any spell cast upon it and immediately convert it into three ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' that blasted outward in straight lines from the crystal facets in directions chosen by the caster. This act consumed the gem in the process.",
        "Trivia": "Ravenars were considered prized gems among the [[drow]]. Their [[lesser deity]] [[Vhaeraun]] was known to occasionally send ravenars to show his favour or disfavour to his followers."
