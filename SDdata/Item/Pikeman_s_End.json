        "mainbody": "'''''Pikeman's End''''' was the old [[enchanted]] [[greatsword]] that once served an outlaw warlord from the [[Western Heartlands]] named [[Kath Tahl]].",
        "Description": "This heavy two-handed sword showed signs of wear and heavy use. Its served blade was notched and stained.",
        "Powers": "''Pikeman's End'' possessed a ''+3'' enchantment.",
        "History": "This sword's first recorded owner was an infamous bandit lord who raided villages and ravaged peasant militias of the Western Heartlands sometime before [[1281 DR]]. This blade received its name from Kath Tahl's devastating battle strategy that breached a line of militia [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s by sending heavily armored troops in sowing disarray and chopping the [[polearm]]s into splinters. Once pikemen were broken, he sent in the cavalry to take anything the warlord wanted. Eventually, ''Pikeman's End'' ended up in the hands of [[Marhap the Blackbeard]], Kath Tahl's rival warlord, after he defeated Kath's men and killed the bandit.\n\nBy 1281 DR, ''Pikeman's End'' ended up in the possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]]."
