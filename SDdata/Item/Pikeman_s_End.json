        "mainbody": "Pikemans End was the old enchanted greatsword that once served an outlaw warlord from the Western Heartlands named Kath Tahl.\nThis heavy two-handed sword showed signs of wear and heavy use. Its served blade was notched and stained.\nPikemans End possessed a +3 enchantment.\nThis swords first recorded owner was an infamous bandit lord who raided villages and ravaged peasant militias of the Western Heartlands sometime before 1281 DR. This blade received its name from Kath Tahls devastating battle strategy that breached a line of militia pikes by sending heavily armored troops in sowing disarray and chopping the polearms into splinters. Once pikemen were broken, he sent in the cavalry to take anything the warlord wanted. Eventually, Pikemans End ended up in the hands of Marhap the Blackbeard, Kath Tahls rival warlord, after he defeated Kaths men and killed the bandit.\nBy 1281 DR, Pikemans End ended up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar."
