'''''Worgfang''''' was an enchanted [[dagger]] that could keep its owner out of harm's way when facing [[goblins]].

==Description==
This well-crafted dagger had an engraving on its hilt that said "goblins shall not strike you down."

==Powers==
''Worgfang'' possessed an enchantment that made it significantly harder for goblins to land a successful hit on its owner.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], ''Worgfang'' was found in [[worg]] pens of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] inside the [[Shattered Sanctum]]. The [[goblin]]s of the cult threw its owner to be torn apart by the vicious creatures, after the adventurer proved to be an elusive opponent, thanks to the dagger's enchantment.
