Worgfang was an enchanted dagger that could keep its owner out of harms way when facing goblins.
This well-crafted dagger had an engraving on its hilt that said "goblins shall not strike you down."
Worgfang possessed an enchantment that made it significantly harder for goblins to land a successful hit on its owner.
In 1492 DR, Worgfang was found in worg pens of the Cult of the Absolute inside the Shattered Sanctum. The goblins of the cult threw its owner to be torn apart by the vicious creatures, after the adventurer proved to be an elusive opponent, thanks to the daggers enchantment.
