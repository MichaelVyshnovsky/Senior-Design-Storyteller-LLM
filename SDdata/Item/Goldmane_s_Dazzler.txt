'''''Goldmane's Dazzler''''' was a magical [[lantern]].{{Cite dragon/179/7 Enlightening Lanterns|27}}

==Description==
''Goldmane's Dazzler'' was an exquisitely crafted artifact, appearing as a [[lion]]'s head meticulously carved with eyes of large green gemstones, affixed to a cylindrical base of [[gold]]. The materials employed in its construction were of substantial value, amounting to thousands of [[gold piece]]s. A handle, composed of gold with an [[ivory]] grip, extended from the lion's ears. Unique among lanterns, ''Goldmane's Dazzler'' emitted light from its open jaws without the necessity for any combustible fuel. This luminosity was perpetual and could not be extinguished once the jaws were parted. Inscribed on the reverse of the gold cylinder were the words "Dazzle" and "Roar," rendered in the [[Common]] script.

==Abilities==
When the jaws were opened and the command "Dazzle" was spoken, a beam of dazzling light emanated from the lion's mouth. This beam functioned similarly to the [[spell]] ''[[confusion]]''. This ability was ineffective against creatures that were blind and could only be activated once every 24 hours.

When the command "Roar" was spoken and the jaws were opened, several effects occurred simultaneously. Firstly, the light dimmed, and the eyes of the lion glowed intensely. Secondly, there was a significant inrush of air, which extinguished all [[torch]]es within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. Immediately following this, the lion's head emitted a powerful roar. This roar deafened all creatures within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} and generated a ''[[cone of force]]'' that extended {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} in width at the end. Any creature within this cone suffered damage and was knocked off its feet. The ''cone of force'' also destroyed doors and light wooden structures less than {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} thick, and inflicted structural damage to stone or earth structures. If used underground, it had the potential to cause a cave-in. This powerful effect could only be utilized once per week.

==History==
''Goldmane's Dazzler'' was crafted in the city of [[Myth Drannor]] at the height of its cultural prominence. It was the work of a skilled [[dwarven]] goldsmith and was enchanted by the [[wizard]] [[Goldmane]], designed to be both a masterpiece of beauty and a potent magical artifact. When Myth Drannor fell, the lantern was taken by an [[elf]] mage named [[Silverhair]], who intended to transport it to [[Evermeet]]. However, Silverhair's party was ambushed by a band of [[orc]]s. Utilizing surprise and superior numbers, the orcs overpowered the elves and enslaved them. The lantern remained in the hall of the orc chieftain until it was stolen by a group of [[halfling]] thieves known as [[Swifthand, Inc.]], who infiltrated the lair and absconded with a significant amount of treasure, including the lantern.

The halfling band sold the lantern to a trader on the [[Wyvernwater]] in [[Cormyr]], who subsequently sold it to a wealthy merchant from [[Arabel]]. The merchant kept the lantern for several years until his death, at which point he bequeathed it to a favored nephew residing in [[Scornubel]]. Unfortunately, the caravan transporting the lantern to the nephew was attacked by bandits just west of [[High Horn]]. The merchant's nephew offered a substantial reward for its return.
