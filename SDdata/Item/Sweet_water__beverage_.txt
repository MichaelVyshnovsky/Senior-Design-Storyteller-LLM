'''Sweet water''' was a naturally occurring, sweet-tasting carbonated water.

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], sweet water was available for sale by the flask at the [[Apothecary (Triboar)|Apothecary]] in [[Triboar]]. The shop's owner, [[Tarmock Felaskur]], harvested the drink from a small spring hidden in a shack behind his home.

The primary buyer and reseller of sweet water in Triboar was The [[Pleasing Platter]], an upscale restaurant that catered mostly to visiting [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobility]].
