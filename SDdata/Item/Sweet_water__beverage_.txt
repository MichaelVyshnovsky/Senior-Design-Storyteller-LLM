Sweet water was a naturally occurring, sweet-tasting carbonated water.
As of the late 15 century DR, sweet water was available for sale by the flask at the Apothecary in Triboar. The shops owner, Tarmock Felaskur, harvested the drink from a small spring hidden in a shack behind his home.
The primary buyer and reseller of sweet water in Triboar was The Pleasing Platter, an upscale restaurant that catered mostly to visiting Waterdhavian nobility.
