'''Wargongs''' were broad and heavy gongs made of metal that produced a loud thundering sound.

==Description==
Wargongs were traditionally made from the battered shields of enemies or large, beaten brass circles.{{Cite dragon/123/Music of the Forgotten Realms|14}} They were popular musical instruments among [[goblin]]s and [[dwarf|dwarves]] and were commonly played in the [[Underdark]].

Another variant of wargong consisted of a large [[copper]] disk that could produce a loud sound when struck heavily or a sustained rumble if played with mallets. This variant of wargong was popular in courts and battlefields alike, as they could also be used to transmit signals between outposts across great distances.

Wargongs crafted in [[Shou Lung]] were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' but had to be specially ordered.
