Bowls were a common piece of crockery found everywhere in Faer√ªn.
Bowls were a fundamental part of kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and serving meals (often with a spoon), especially those like soups, stews, and porridge, and a standard part of the mess kit used by travelers. Cheap, common bowls were made from wood, but finer crockery was made of ceramics such as porcelain, often with decorative glazing that made them into works of art.
Mortars were special bowls used for grinding materials into powder, while braziers were essentially large metal bowls used for holding burning fuel.
