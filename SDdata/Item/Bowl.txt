'''Bowls''' were a common piece of crockery found everywhere in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Bowls were a fundamental part of kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and serving meals (often with a [[spoon]]), especially those like [[soup]]s, [[stew]]s, and [[porridge]], and a standard part of the [[mess kit]] used by travelers. Cheap, common bowls were made from wood, but finer crockery was made of [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], often with decorative glazing that made them into works of art.

[[Mortar and pestle|Mortars]] were special bowls used for grinding materials into powder, while [[brazier]]s were essentially large metal bowls used for holding burning fuel.

==Notable Bowls==
* ''[[Bowl of blood]]'', a magic bowl that produced blood.
* ''[[Bowl of commanding water elementals]]'', a magical bowl that controlled [[water elemental]]s.
* ''[[Bowl of watery death]]'', a variety of magical bowls that looked identical to a ''bowl of commanding water elementals'' but were actually deadly traps for anyone that dared to use them.<ref>
