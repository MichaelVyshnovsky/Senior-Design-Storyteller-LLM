        "mainbody": "The Mantle of Hells Furnace was a brightly colored enchanted cloak imbued with raw magics of the Elemental Plane of Fire.\nThe Mantle was a bright red cloth woven out of the flaming beard hair of countless azers. Sages believed that when the Mantle of Hells Furnace exhausted its magics, it would disappear from the Prime Material plane and be pulled back to the Elemental Plane of Fire.\nThe enchantments weaved into the fabric of the cloak were powerful and allowed the wearer to cast Aganazzars scorcher, burning hands, and charm fire elemental kin.\nThe first known owner of this cloak was Ullabem, the High Priest of Kossuth. He harnessed the cloaks magic for fifteen years until his death at the hands of a cleric of Istishia. The priestess was repulsed by the Kossuthan magic and attempted to destroy the Mantle. Fortunately, Ullabems efreeti allies slew the cleric before the cloak could be lost forever. The next owner of the Mantle of Hells Furnace was one of the efreeti who lost it to a cunning rogue who summoned the efreeti from a magical  block of sandalwood.\nSome time later, by the , the Mantle of Hells Furnace ended up in possession of Orrick the Gray, who researched magical mythals in his tower just on the edge of Kuldahar on the Spine of the World."
