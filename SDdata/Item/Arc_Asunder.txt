'''''Arc Asunder''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[halberd]]s that possessed magics that dealt death electricity damage to their targets.

==Powers==
''Arc Asunder'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and arced electricity onto its targets upon a successful strike. Additionally, the weapons increased the wielder's ability to parry attacks and glowed with blue light, illuminating {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} around it.

==History==
These enchanted halberds were thought to have originated from the great wastes of the Anauroch desert. Sages believed that the electricity that enchanted ''Arc Asunder'' came from heavy thunderstorms that ravaged the region's air. The original creator likely wanted the weapons to be as dangerous as the [[Great Sand Sea]] itself.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Arc Asunder'' weapons could be found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] as well as the [[Market Triangle]] in [[Westgate]].
