'''Fowler's snares''' were tools sometimes used by [[ranger]]s or woodsmen throughout [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
A fowler's snare consisted of a wooden structure surrounded by netting with an closable opening.

==History==
As its name implied, a fowler's snare was used to catch birds of various sizes.

Fowler's snares were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' for 1 [[gold piece]] for a small snare and 3 gold pieces for a larger snare.
