Fowlers snares were tools sometimes used by rangers or woodsmen throughout Faerûn.
A fowlers snare consisted of a wooden structure surrounded by netting with an closable opening.
As its name implied, a fowlers snare was used to catch birds of various sizes.
Fowlers snares were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 1 gold piece for a small snare and 3 gold pieces for a larger snare.
