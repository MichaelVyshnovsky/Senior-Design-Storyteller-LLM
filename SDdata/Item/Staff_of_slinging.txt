A '''''staff of slinging''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] capable of slinging objects through the air.

==Powers==
These quarterstaffs made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponents. If wielded by a [[druid]], a ''staff of slinging'' could hurl roughly spherical objects through the air. The size of the object could be no larger than {{SI|9|in|c}} in diameter and had to weigh less than {{SI|5|lb|k}}. The druid simply touched one end of the staff to the object then swung the staff toward a target, releasing the held object with a mental command. The object would rise slightly when thrown, moving upward {{SI|1|ft}} for every {{SI|10|ft}} traveled. Larger objects could be hurled in this manner if the druid expended one of the staff's charges.

Druids were capable of recharging these items.

==Notable Owners==
[[Cyndre]], a [[Thayan]] [[wizard]] inhabiting the [[Moonshae Isles]], wielded a ''staff of slinging''.
