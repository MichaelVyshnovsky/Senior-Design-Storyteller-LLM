A staff of slinging was an enchanted quarterstaff capable of slinging objects through the air.
These quarterstaffs made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponents. If wielded by a druid, a staff of slinging could hurl roughly spherical objects through the air. The size of the object could be no larger than  in diameter and had to weigh less than . The druid simply touched one end of the staff to the object then swung the staff toward a target, releasing the held object with a mental command. The object would rise slightly when thrown, moving upward  for every  traveled. Larger objects could be hurled in this manner if the druid expended one of the staffs charges.
Druids were capable of recharging these items.
Cyndre, a Thayan wizard inhabiting the Moonshae Isles, wielded a staff of slinging.
