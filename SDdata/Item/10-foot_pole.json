        "Description": "As befitting their name, 10-foot poles were often {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} long. While this made them useful, they were also quite cumbersome and bulky, especially in tight spaces such as dungeons.\n\nThe '''collapsible pole''' was a more complex and handy variant, which took the form of a {{SIAdj|2|feet|long=yes}} pole that could telescope out to 4, 6, 8, 10, or {{SI|12|feet|long=yes}} long, then locked in place. A second pole could also be attached to the first, creating a single pole up to {{SI|22|feet|long=yes}} long.",
        "Availability": "Wooden poles and staves were simple to make, and were commonly made on [[lathe]]s by woodworking shops such as [[Gullaxe's Stairs, Rails, Poles, Staves and Handles]].",
        "Usage": "Poles could be used to jam doors open, pass items over gaps, extend the reach of [[magnet]]s or other attachments, and do anything else a creative utilitarian could imagine. They were also used to tap or prod at suspected [[trap]]s, a feature especially valued by adventurers that delved into dungeons. They made a good companion to more-complex [[thieves' tools]].\n\nA solid 10-foot or longer pole could serve as a vaulting pole, and allowed very long or high jumps. A good pole could also serve as an improvised climbing surface, similar to a [[rope]], or be used to construct a simple [[ladder]].\n\nSmall [[boat]]s such as [[raft]]s, [[skiff]]s, and [[barge]]s could be propelled through shallow waters via pole, rather than by sail or [[oar]].\n\nMany useful tools were made from poles with a specialized attachments. These included [[pitchfork]]s, [[broom]]s, [[shovel]]s, [[hoe]]s, [[rake]]s, [[gaff]]s, [[oar]]s, and [[fishing rod]]s.\n\n[[Pole arm]]s were essentially poles with deadly implements attached on the end to turn them into long-reaching weapons.{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|23}} Simplified further, a solid pole could be made into a [[quarterstaff]], and served as a handy bludgeon.",
        "Notable Poles": "* The ''[[pole of angling]]'' was a magical 10-foot pole that could transform into a [[fishing rod]], and back again.\n* The ''[[pole of collapsing]]'' was a simple [[magical item]] that could collapse to {{SI|1|feet|long=yes}} or extend to 10 feet.\n* [[Spider poles]] were a collection of short metal poles that could be assembled into a climbing frame or ladder."
