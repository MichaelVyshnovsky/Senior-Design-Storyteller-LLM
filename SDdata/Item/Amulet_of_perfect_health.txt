The '''''amulet of perfect health''''' was an enchanted ancient [[elf|elven]] [[amulet]] from the [[Elven Catacombs]] of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The amulet resembled a delicate heart-shaped pendant.

==Powers==
The ''amulet of perfect health'' was enchanted to give its wearer access to the ''[[heal]]'' spell. The amulet, however, had a downside as it affected the wearer's constitution, making them noticeably more frail. The amulet had four charges.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], this amulet was looted from one of the many ancient elven graves within the Elven Catacombs under [[Castle Cormanthor]]. Eventually it fell into the "hands" of a [[dark naga]] [[Gulrithi]] who nested within the dungeon. The creature exhibited control of several powerful undead creatures, such as a master [[wight]], and several [[mohrg]]s and used them as personal guards.
