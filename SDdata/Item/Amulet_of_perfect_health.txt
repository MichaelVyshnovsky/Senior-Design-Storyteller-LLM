The amulet of perfect health was an enchanted ancient elven amulet from the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor.
The amulet resembled a delicate heart-shaped pendant.
The amulet of perfect health was enchanted to give its wearer access to the heal spell. The amulet, however, had a downside as it affected the wearers constitution, making them noticeably more frail. The amulet had four charges.
In 1369 DR, this amulet was looted from one of the many ancient elven graves within the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor. Eventually it fell into the "hands" of a dark naga Gulrithi who nested within the dungeon. The creature exhibited control of several powerful undead creatures, such as a master wight, and several mohrgs and used them as personal guards.
