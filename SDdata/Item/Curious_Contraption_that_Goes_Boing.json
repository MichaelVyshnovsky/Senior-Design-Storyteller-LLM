        "mainbody": "The '''''Curious Contraption that Goes Boing''''' was a strange and mysterious magical mechanism from the Tomb underneath [[Gillian's Hill]].",
        "Description": "The contraption had a thick base, a long spring-like bouncy stem, and was topped with a round crystal head. When used, it made a loud \"boing\" sound.",
        "History": "The ''Curious Contraption that Goes Boing'' came from the ancient and almost-inaccessible Tomb under Gillian's Hill. Even though it was plundered from the [[Underdark]] long before [[1372 DR]], it still held numerous mysteries. In the past, the Tomb was also a home of a [[mind flayer]] hive that brainwashed merchants of the [[Trade Way]] and lured them to certain death within the ancient subterranean tunnels. Eventually, illithids were cleaned out by a group of heroes, but the Tomb remained a mysterious place, only accessible via an invisible ''[[portal]]''. Sometime before 1372 DR but after the illithids' departure, a group of [[warrior]]s and [[barbarian]]s managed to get inside the Tomb and did some plundering. Not versed in the [[arcane]], they dragged the ''Curious Contraption that Goes Boing'' to the surface, hoping it was of some value.\n\n[[Torleth Mindulspeer]] of [[Torleth's Treasures]] purchased the widget for several [[gold]] [[coin]]s and kept in the shop to entertain local kids who liked bouncing on the device. Illithids would've been terrified to see their arcane technology used this way."
