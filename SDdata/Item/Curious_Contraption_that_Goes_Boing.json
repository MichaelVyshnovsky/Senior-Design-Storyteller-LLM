        "mainbody": "he Curious Contraption that Goes Boing was a strange and mysterious magical mechanism from the Tomb underneath Gillians Hill.\nThe contraption had a thick base, a long spring-like bouncy stem, and was topped with a round crystal head. When used, it made a loud \"boing\" sound.\nThe Curious Contraption that Goes Boing came from the ancient and almost-inaccessible Tomb under Gillians Hill. Even though it was plundered from the Underdark long before 1372 DR, it still held numerous mysteries. In the past, the Tomb was also a home of a mind flayer hive that brainwashed merchants of the Trade Way and lured them to certain death within the ancient subterranean tunnels. Eventually, illithids were cleaned out by a group of heroes, but the Tomb remained a mysterious place, only accessible via an invisible portal. Sometime before 1372 DR but after the illithids departure, a group of warriors and barbarians managed to get inside the Tomb and did some plundering. Not versed in the arcane, they dragged the Curious Contraption that Goes Boing to the surface, hoping it was of some value.\nTorleth Mindulspeer of Torleths Treasures purchased the widget for several gold coins and kept in the shop to entertain local kids who liked bouncing on the device. Illithids wouldve been terrified to see their arcane technology used this way."
