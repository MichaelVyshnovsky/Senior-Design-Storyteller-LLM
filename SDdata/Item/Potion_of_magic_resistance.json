        "mainbody": "A '''''potion of magic resistance''''' was a [[potion]] that provided [[Magic resistance|resistance against magical effects]].",
        "Description": "The potion was prepared in flasks. Normally, such a flask contained enough for four uses.",
        "Powers": "The potion provided the imbiber with resistance against magic for two to eight minutes. No inherent resistance against magic on the imbiber's side was needed to benefit from it. If the imbiber had a natural resistance against magic, that resistance was replaced with the one provided by the potion. The strength of the granted resistance fluctuated from dose to dose. Multiple consumptions of the potion with the duration of the first had no effect except for a slight tingling of the nerves, which also happened when the potion was effective.",
        "History": "[[Drow]] had an inborn resistance against magic. While this resistance was strong in the case of adults, infants and newborns were not only weak but also not stable until they were youths. Originally, drow [[alchemist]]s invented the ''potion of magic resistance'' long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] to protect children from the additional magical danger they were exposed to, but use of it spread for combat purposes as well."
