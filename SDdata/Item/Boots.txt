'''Boots''' were a piece of [[armor]] (or clothing) used for defending the feet and lower legs.

==Description==
Boots came in several types (such as high, low, hard, and soft), and could be enchanted. [[Riding boots]] were used by [[adventurer]]s when riding mounts.

Those who wore [[magic]]al boots must wear the pair (one on each foot) to receive the benefits. Oddly matched boots provided no benefit.

[[Plate armor]], which covered almost all of the body, included heavy [[leather]] boots. Climber's kits came with boot tips to make scaling mountainous slopes much more easy.

==Notable Boots==
* ''[[Boots of elvenkind]]''
* ''[[Boots of speed]]''
* ''[[Boots of striding and springing]]''

==Trivia==
* The [[holy symbol]] of [[Marthammor Duin]] was a tall boot behind a vertical [[mace]].
* In the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[wizard]] [[Thendarion]] became trapped in a boot.
* [[Hethmeir's Highboots]] in [[Everlund]] sold custom-made boots. They could be made from almost any hide and cost up to 1,000 [[gp]] per pair.
