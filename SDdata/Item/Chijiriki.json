        "Description": "A chijiriki was a standard [[spear]] between {{SIrange|7|10|ft|long=yes}} in length that has been augmented with a length of weighted chain attached to its butt end. It offered the versatility of being used as a regular spear for thrusting and striking, while the weighted [[chain]] on the opposite end allowed for tripping attacks. By swinging the butt end, the weapon entangled an opponent, providing a means of immobilization or control during combat."
