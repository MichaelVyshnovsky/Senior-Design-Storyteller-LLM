        "mainbody": "Horel was a drug and poison created by distilling a freshwater lily pad plant called halflings hand, also known as oxhrel, and mixing it in a certain secret proportion with powdered horseradish.\nThe resulting substance was a green liquid, harmless to skin contact or ingestion. However, if a needle or a weapon was coated with horel and the substance entered the bloodstream, the victim started violently convulsing, which dramatically affected their ability to defend oneself in battle or perform a simple task requiring a steady hand."
