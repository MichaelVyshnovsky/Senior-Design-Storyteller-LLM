        "mainbody": "'''Horel''' was a [[drug]] and [[poison]] created by distilling a freshwater lily pad plant called [[halfling's hand]], also known as oxhrel, and mixing it in a certain secret proportion with powdered [[horseradish]].",
        "Powers": "The resulting substance was a green liquid, harmless to skin contact or ingestion. However, if a needle or a weapon was coated with horel and the substance entered the bloodstream, the victim started violently convulsing, which dramatically affected their ability to defend oneself in battle or perform a simple task requiring a steady hand."
