        "mainbody": "The '''''staff of the necromancer''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[staff]] that belonged to [[Hodkamset]], a powerful [[wizard]] who served [[Set]].",
        "Description": "The [[alabaster]] staff was made from the spine bones of a [[dragon]].",
        "Powers": "The ''staff of the necromancer'' absorbed [[magic]] similar to a ''[[staff of the magi]]''. The staff could ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[speak with the dead]]'', and offered ''[[protection from good]]''. The staff had 25 charges that could be used for additional powers. The staff could ''[[animate dead]]'', cast ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', and ''[[hold person]]'' by expending a single charge. Expending two charges allowed the wielder to ''[[command undead]]'', ''[[enfeeble]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', and ''life level drain'' that automatically drained a portion of a target's memories and experiences.",
        "History": "The Staff of the necromancer was created by Hodkamset as a replica of the [[Alabaster Staff]], a legendary artifact created by the [[Untheric pantheon]] in ancient times. However, it was said that the Alabaster Staff was twenty-five times more powerful than the Staff of the necromancer. \n\nThe staff was stolen from Hodkamset by [[priest]]s of [[Osiris]], but later returned to him after it was retrieved by Set's [[assassin]]s."
