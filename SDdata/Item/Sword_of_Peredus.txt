The '''''Sword of Peredus''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[longsword]], a lesser version of a ''[[holy avenger]]'' weapon that belonged to a fabled hero, [[Peredus]] the Great.

==Powers==
The ''Sword of Peredus'' had a ''+2'' enchantment and was blessed by a high [[priest]] of [[Torm]], allowing it to be especially deadly to creatures that venerated evil. When wielded against evil, the sword was empowered by [[positive energy]]. The ''Sword of Peredus'' radiated gentle white light {{SI|15'|'"|long=yes}} around it. The Tormish nature of this longsword made it usable by creatures of pure heart only.

==History==
The enchanted blade was famously wielded by Peredus, a heroic caravan guard who perished in a bandit attack while traveling along the [[Trade Way]]. For many years, the sword and the hero's body were left at the bottom of a wishing well in the [[Western Heartland]] for many years. Eventually, the story of the hero became a popular ballad in the city of [[Daggerford]], silly called ''[[Peredus the Great]]''. The song mentioned the powerful magical ''Sword of Peredus'' making it a desirable treasure that attracted many adventurers over the course of passing years. Eventually, the sword's location was discovered by [[Burnas Tellrot]] in [[1372 DR]]. The [[halfling]] sent adventurers to retrieve it for them only to be devoured by a [[black dragon]] [[Sulfurus]].
