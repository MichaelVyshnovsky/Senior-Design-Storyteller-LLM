Snowbread was a sweet bread available at the Hungry Man in Arabel, Cormyr in 1368 DR.
Snowbread was made from molasses and nuts, affording it a rich, sweet flavor.
According to Elminster, snowbread got its name from the copious amounts of sugar, flour, and white egg sauce sprinkled over the breads surface. This gives the bread a hard exterior coating.
Snowbread could either be served plain or with hot sweet sauce drizzled over the top.
