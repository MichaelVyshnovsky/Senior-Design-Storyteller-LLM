        "mainbody": "Flaming was an enchantment that caused flames to sheathe a weapon.\nThis quality was command-word activated and the flames that enveloped the weapon did not harm the wielder. The flames burned a target upon being struck. Missile weapons conferred this ability on any ammunition launched from them.\nThe creator must use flame blade, flame strike, or fireball to add the flaming property.\nMovanic devas typically wielded flaming greatswords.\nSome experienced Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as flaming weapons."
