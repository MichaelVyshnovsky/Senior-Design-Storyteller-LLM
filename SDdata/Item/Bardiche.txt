The '''bardiche''' was a member of the poleaxe family of [[polearm]]s.

==Description==
The bardiche was similar in design to the average [[battleaxe]], but elongated. They were rather broad and heavy, with shafts measuring {{SIrange|5|8|ft|long=yes}} in length and large, narrow, curved axeheads measuring {{SIrange|24|32|in|long=yes}} in length or {{SIrange|2|3|ft}}. This axehead was mounted to its shaft by means of two metal rings, the lower of which improved the axehead's strength and protected the bardiche's most exposed area from attacks.

==Weaponology==
Bardiches were rather cumbersome and unwiedly,<ref>{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|23}} more so than a [[halberd]], requiring more room to wield than a [[pike]] or [[spear]].

The upper half of the bardiche's axehead could be utilized for thrusting.

==Availability==
Places in the Realms where one could purchase bardiches included:
* The [[Weaponers of Cormyr]].
