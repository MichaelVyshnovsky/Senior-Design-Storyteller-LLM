'''Pork fat''', sometimes in the form of '''lard''' or '''bacon fat''', was the fat of [[pig]]s and [[boar]]s. It was generally for use in cooking.{{Cite digital book/Spellfire||11}}{{Cite dungeon/87/The Raiders of Galath's Roost|37}}

==Description==
Pork fat was popular for culinary applications in places like [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]],{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|92-93}} [[Tethyr]],{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}} and the [[Western Heartlands]]. The lard of wild boars was generally interchangeable with that of domestic pigs.

Pork fat could be either liquid or semi-solid, requiring that it be scooped.{{Cite dragon/246/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Cauldrons and Cookery|84}} It was perishable and thus often stored in the same environments as [[pork]] or [[vegetable]]s, but it could also be packaged in [[cask]]s for transport, such as on [[ship]]s. It was generally quite flammable.

===Culinary Uses===
In cooking, pork fat was measured by the "[[knife (unit of measurement)|knife]]". It was often used to cook or fry other foods, such as [[fish]], game fowl like [[quail]], to low-class [[bloodlick]],{{Cite dragon/418/Inns in an Instant}} or [[pie]] and [[pastry]] dough.

In places like [[Raven's Bluff]], rancid pork fat was sometimes boiled into a stew to feed to prisoners.

It was said that some [[elves]] had a form of [[ration]]s that were patties made of [[corn]], dried [[fruit]]s, [[nut]]s, [[seed]]s and small [[candy|candies]] that were held together by lard, [[honey]], [[molasses]] and/or [[sugar]].

===Other Uses===
In [[magic]], a pinch of lard was used as a [[material component]] in the ''[[grease slick]]'' spell. It could also be used by [[alchemist]]s and [[druid]]s in the making of [[ointment]]s by mixing it with dry or caky substances to allow it to be applied to the skin.

Pig fat could also be used as a lubricant. For example, it could make a smooth surface slippery, such as for setting a trap similar to a use of ''[[oil of slipperiness]]''.{{Cite dragon/273/Something Up Your Sleeve|52}} Grapplers could also apply it to their skin to give them an edge against being grabbed,{{Cite dragon/413/Spin a Yarn: Jantharl's Surprising Journey|20}} Some sages suggested applying a coating of pork fat over exposed skin prior to battling a [[steel dragon]] or [[black dragon]] in order to protect from the effects of the beasts' breath weapons.

==Availability==
Pork fat could be found in pantries and larders across [[Faer√ªn]]. 

===Notable Locations===
Inns, taverns, and restaurants notable for their use of pork fat included:
* The [[High Moon Inn]] in [[Highmoon]] used it as a cooking medium.
* [[Hot Highsun Handbreads]] in [[Gladehap]] used pork fat in their [[rabbit pate]].
* The [[Watchful Eye (Essembra)|Watchful Eye]] in [[Essembra]] used it when making the dough for its famous [[stuffed turkey pie]].
* [[Waukeen's Rest]] on the [[Risen Road]] served potato wedges fried in pork fat.
* [[Wyrmkindler Sausage Works]] in [[Gladehap]] used pork fat as part of the filling in their [[stag sausage]].

==Rumors & Legends==
There was said to exist a [[wondrous item]] known as the ''[[everful jug of lard]]'' which could provide an endless supply of pork fat for cooking.
