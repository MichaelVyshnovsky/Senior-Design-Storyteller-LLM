        "mainbody": "he mouth harp, also referred to as the Jews harp on Earth, was a type of pocket-sized instrument found in the Realms.\nThis instrument was characterized by a two-pronged, bottle-shaped frame with a metal tongue that was affixed at one end of its base. This tongue would be held between the teeth of a musician and allowed them to alter the sound produced by their mouth cavity.\n* Renee Handly played a variety of different instruments as a member of the bardic musical band Cobalt Flame. These included the mouth harp, flute, pan pipes, and trumpet.\nMouth harps were used on the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur where they were considered a valuable trade commodity."
