==Description==
These kits typically included a wooden rod, a [[silk]]en line, and [[steel]] hooks that would all be assembled to form a [[fishing rod]]. These kits also typically included narrow netting, [[velvet]] lures, a variety of fishing tackles, such as bobbers made from [[corkwood]] and leadsinkers.

==Price==
The price of fishing tackles varied depending upon the demand and availability.

==Availability==
General goods stores that stocked adventuring gear typically had these kits for sale. One known supplier of these kits was [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']], whose kits included rods made of [[birch]]wood.

===Individuals===
* [[Jelde Asturien]] almost never left his home town of [[Eveningstar]] without his fishing tackle.
