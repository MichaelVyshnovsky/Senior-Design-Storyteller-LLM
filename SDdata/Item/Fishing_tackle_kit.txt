Fishing tackle kits were boxed sets of gear necessary for fishing.
These kits typically included a wooden rod, a silken line, and steel hooks that would all be assembled to form a fishing rod. These kits also typically included narrow netting, velvet lures, a variety of fishing tackles, such as bobbers made from corkwood and leadsinkers.
The price of fishing tackles varied depending upon the demand and availability.
General goods stores that stocked adventuring gear typically had these kits for sale. One known supplier of these kits was Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, whose kits included rods made of birchwood.
