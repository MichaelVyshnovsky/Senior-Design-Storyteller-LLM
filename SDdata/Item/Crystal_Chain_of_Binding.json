        "mainbody": "The '''''Crystal Chain of Binding''''' was a powerful [[Netherese]] [[artifact]] that could strip any spellcaster from tapping into [[the Weave]].\n\n{{Quote|To chain a mage? Why, the promise of power and knowing secrets ('magic,' if you will), greed, and love-the things that chain all men...and some of the more foolish women, too.|''Excerpt from [[Musings of a Witch-Queen in Exile]]''.}}",
        "Description": "Unique in its function, the ''Crystal Chain'' held the consciousnesses of many senior [[wizard]]s who sought to achieve a form of immortality when their bodies ultimately succumbed to age. While the personality of each contained mage varied, they all shared the same wisdom regarding the correct, and incorrect, uses of the arcane arts.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-22/Crystal Chain of Binding}}",
        "History": "The ''Crystal Chain'' was forged in Netheril, centuries before [[Dale Reckoning]], and thought to be lost forever after the ancient empire collapsed. For hundreds of years, men, [[elves]], and [[dwarves]] alike all sought the artifact for their own use.\n\nIt was finally recovered in the early-to-mid 3{{rd}} century [[DR]], by the [[magelord]] [[Neldryn Hawklyn]] of [[Athalantar]]. It did not remain in his possession for long however, as it was then claimed by the then-[[magister]], [[Dorgon Heamiiolothtar]]."
