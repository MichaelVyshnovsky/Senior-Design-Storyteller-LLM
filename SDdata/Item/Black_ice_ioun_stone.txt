Black ice ioun stones were enchanted gems that floated around a bearers head, imbuing magics onto the owner.
These magic items were created when an ioun stone was exposed to the corrupting powers of black ice. When one of these ioun stones was activated, it granted the owner magically increased defense when they were hit by an opponent, and additionally it increased the speed of the wearers allies.
Black ice ioun stones started appearing in the northern region of Icewind Dale circa 1485 DR, following the influx in production of items of black ice that originated in Kelvins Cairn and led by Baerick Hammerstone who attempted to wrestle the leadership position from Stokely Silverstream of Clan Battlehammer.
