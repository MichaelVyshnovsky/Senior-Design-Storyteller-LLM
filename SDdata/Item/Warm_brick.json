        "mainbody": "Warm bricks were a type of enchanted brick created by an unknown, young enchantress prior to circa 1357 DR.Pages from the Mages provides no precise dates, only things happening X years ago, and mostly reprints from earlier sourcebooks like the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set and The Magister (sourcebook) (both assumed to be 1357 DR), without changing their own references to things happening X years ago. Therefore, dates should be decided based on earlier works, but 1357 DR may be assumed for most spellbooks.\nThese looked like average bricks with dimensions that were  x  x .\nAs their name implied, these bricks were enchanted to radiate heat. A single brick radiated enough to warm everything within a  radius, maintaining a temperature of around . This depended upon weather conditions, as they were inert until the natural air temperature was below  and would radiate more heat the colder conditions became."
