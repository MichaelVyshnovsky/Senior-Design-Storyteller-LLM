'''''Rapiers of the High Road''''' were [[enchanted]] [[rapier]]s created especially for larcenous purposes.

==Powers==
These rapiers possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that made the blade more deadly and its aim more precise. Its ''[[keen]]'' blade could land devastating and deadly slashes and it produced [[acid]] that dealt additional damage with each landed attack.

==History==
The origin of the ''rapiers of the High Road'' was unknown, however, these blades' light weight and ease of concealment made them a favorite weapon of bandits who preyed on fat merchants and vulnerable travelers. One thing was known for sure – these rapiers were not created for noble purposes as whoever held such weapon received a larcenous gleam in their eyes with the weapon filling their minds with rich purchases and tempted the wielders to take the [[coin]] from others.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, at least one ''rapier of the High Road'' found its way into the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]] underneath the city of [[Waterdeep]].
