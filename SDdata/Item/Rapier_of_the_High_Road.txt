Rapiers of the High Road were enchanted rapiers created especially for larcenous purposes.
These rapiers possessed a +1 enchantment that made the blade more deadly and its aim more precise. Its keen blade could land devastating and deadly slashes and it produced acid that dealt additional damage with each landed attack.

One thing was known for sure â€“ these rapiers were not created for noble purposes as whoever held such weapon received a larcenous gleam in their eyes with the weapon filling their minds with rich purchases and tempted the wielders to take the coin from others.
