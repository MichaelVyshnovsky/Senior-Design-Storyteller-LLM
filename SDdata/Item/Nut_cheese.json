        "mainbody": "'''Nut cheese''' was a type of [[cheese]] mixed with [[nut]]s produced in many cities of the [[Savage Frontier]], including [[Silverymoon]], [[Mirabar]], and [[Sundabar]]. A selection was available from ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.",
        "Description": "Each [[North]]ern city produced its own variety of nut cheese. If ordered from ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'' without specifying a desired origin, a customer would receive an assorted lot.\n\nNut cheeses were hard and rich, and mixed with ground [[hickory]] nuts, [[walnut]]s, and [[chestnut]]s. Once mixed with the nuts, the cheeses would be left to ripen."
