A '''''relic of Semuanya''''' was a small [[enchanted]] trinket used by the [[Semuanya]]-worshiping [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
A ''relic of Semuanya'' was a small beast claw carved out of [[limestone]]. It radiated a minor magical aura.

==Powers==
The trinket granted its owner a minor immunity to [[acid]] damage and improved their chances of resisting catching a [[disease]], or shaking its effects off faster.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, lizardfolk who served the duo of [[black dragon]]s, [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]], carried a ''relic of Semuanya''. It could be recovered from the [[Dragon Caves]], the black dragon siblings' lair, once a shrine dedicated to [[Tyr]] Grimjaws at the heart of the Mere of Dead Men.
