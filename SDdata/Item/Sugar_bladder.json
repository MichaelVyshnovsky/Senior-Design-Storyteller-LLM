        "mainbody": "'''Sugar bladders''' were confections packed in dried [[pig]]s' bladders. These sweet [[handfood]]s were commonly eaten as appetizers.",
        "Description": "To make a sugar bladder, confections were wrapped inside of the pig bladder and then heated over a fire on a metal plate to dry out the package, at which point the bladder was tied shut and coated in [[tansel]] (a mixture of [[egg]]s and plants intended to provide an airtight seal). They were often packed in vegetable [[oil]] inside of [[tin]]s that were then sealed with [[pitch]], all to prevent spoilage.",
        "Availability": "Sugar bladders were commonly available from shops and restaurants in the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Heartlands]]. They could be transported long distances by caravans owing to their relatively long shelf-life."
