Elemental handglyphs were deadly offensive handglyphs used by the Geomancers of Kadar to harness the raw power of each element.
The power of the elemental handglyph depended on the element which it harnessed. Examples of these handglyphs included a handglyph of fire, a handglyph of cold, and a handglyph of lightning. Especially deadly handglyphs of disintegration also existed.
These handglyphs would typically discharge the effects of a spell related to their element including fireball, cone of cold, lightning bolt, or a ray of disintegration. Their maximum range was usually .
Most elemental handglyphs had between 1â€”4 charges. They could be recharged, but the process for doing so was known only to a select few wizards in Rogosto who charged handsomely for their services.
These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes.
