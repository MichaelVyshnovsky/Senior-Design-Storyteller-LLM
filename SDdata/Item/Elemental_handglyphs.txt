'''''Elemental handglyphs''''' were deadly offensive [[handglyph]]s used by the [[Geomancer]]s of [[Kadar]] to harness the raw power of each element.

==Powers==
The power of the ''elemental handglyph'' depended on the element which it harnessed. Examples of these handglyphs included a ''handglyph of fire'', a ''handglyph of cold'', and a ''handglyph of lightning''. Especially deadly ''handglyphs of disintegration'' also existed.

These handglyphs would typically discharge the effects of a spell related to their element including ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', or a ray of ''[[disintegrate|disintegration]]''. Their maximum range was usually {{SI|30|yd|long=yes}}.

Most ''elemental handglyphs'' had between 1â€”4 charges. They could be recharged, but the process for doing so was known only to a select few [[wizard]]s in [[Rog'osto]] who charged handsomely for their services.

==Description==
These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes.
