        "mainbody": "A stone of good luck, or luckstone, was a small, magically imbued stone that granted its wearer good fortune.\nStones of good luck were usually made from polished agate, carnelian, or alexandrite, though other minerals could also be used. If viewed through a detect magic spell, a stone of good luck gave off a faint evocation aura.\nA luckstone was originally said to appear exactly like a philosophers stone or loadstone. In fact, discerning a philosophers stone from a luckstone seemed to require some destructive testing placing a suspect stone in molten lead would destroy a luckstone, but not a philosophers stone.\nthumb|A luckstone from Chult.\nThey were said to originate in the halfling country of Luiren, with the \"luck of the hin\" having rubbed off on the stones.\nGold dragons of adult age and older (meaning older than a century) could give any gem the properties of a luckstone for 19 hours to 39 hours depending on age. These temporary luckstones gave their benefits to every good creature within 60–120 ft. (18.3–36.6 m) depending on age, if owned by the dragon but only to the holder if given to another creature.\nA crystal dragon who was very old or older could enchant one of its own scales as if it was a stone of good luck for 9 to 12 hours according to its age. They gifted these to especially friendly visitors.\n* Drasna Bluemantle, king of Ulgarth, owned a stone of good luck. Used in tandem with a luckblade, the two items earned him the epithet \"the Fortunate\".\n* The thief/cleric Jak Fleet owned a luckstone, which he kept on a chain fastened to his belt.\n* The illusionist Myste owned a stone of mixed luck, a type of luckstone that only bestowed good luck 85% of the time. On the other 15% of occasions it caused disastrously poor luck.\n* The elven adventurer Sylvanus Moondrop carried a stone of good luck."
