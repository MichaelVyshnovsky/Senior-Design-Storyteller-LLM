        "History": "''Greatshout as a Young Man'' was commissioned as a celebration of Pwyll Daggerford's twenty fifth birthday. At some point after that it was stolen from the ducal vaults.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], this painting was already a collector's item that could score a hefty price. The painting was hidden securely under the curio shop, [[Torleth's Treasures]] in [[Gillian's Hill]]. The painting's owner, [[Torleth Mindulspeer]], kept his under lock and key, protected by iron bars and traps. The security was heightened after the painting's price skyrocketed following the Duke's resumed death in a hunting accident in 1372 DR. Torleth's bitter rival from [[Daggerford]], [[Vladmyr]], wanted to get his hands on the pricy piece of art and use it to humiliate the painting's owner in the process.\n\nThe opportunity to do just that presented itself when [[Davey Halloran]]'s father found himself in a deep gambling debt to Vladmyr the Moneylender. When the [[Hero of Daggerford]] decided to help the down-on-his-luck commoner, Vladmyr offered debt forgiveness in exchange for the ''Greatshout as a Young Man''. The moneylender wanted the painting stolen and replaced with a masterfully crafted fake. When the deed was done, the rare depiction of Duke Daggerford in his youth was in Vladmyr's possession, and Torleth Mindulspeer was humiliated during an auction that was held shortly after."
