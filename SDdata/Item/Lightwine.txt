'''Lightwine''' was a fermented alcoholic drink from [[Twilight Tor]] in the [[Starmetal Hills]].

==Powers==

Lightwine was made out of [[light pod]]s that fell from the skies during the [[Simril]] season in the town of Twilight Tor and across the Starmetal Hills, where they were devoured by fish that dwelt in the region's lakes. This wine was fermented by magical means by the Master of Lights of Twilight Tor. Aged fortified and strengthened lightwine was consumed during the [[Liar's Night]] festival in [[Neverwinter]].

When consumed, lightwine boosted the imbiber's speed and granted them sped up ''[[regeneration]]''.

==History==
