        "mainbody": "sword of dancing, also called a dancing sword, was an enchanted weapon that provided varying degrees of assistance in striking and harming an enemy.\nThese magic weapons could be found as any type of sword.\nA sword of dancing made it easier to strike and harm an opponent. Among some versions of the item, this enchantment got stronger over the course of several minutes before \"resetting\" itself. In addition to this, the wielder could release the sword at any point and allow it to \"dance\", allowing the sword to attack enemies within  without being wielded by hand. The weapon would fall to the ground while dancing if the wielder moved more than  away from it. Depending on the enchantment, a dancing sword could do this for only a limited time, sometimes less than thirty seconds and sometimes for several minutes before needing to return to the wielders hand to recharge for several more minutes before it could dance again.\nSome dancing swords would not dance for their wielder unless they spoke a special command word.\n* Elorfindar Floshin, a sun elf of the Ardeep Forest, wielded a sword of dancing.\n* Eilistraee, the Goddesss signature Moonsword and other blades associated with her had the dancing ability.\n* Arvoreen, the deity who wielded the unique and powerful short sword of dancing, Hornet.\n* Calliope, a bard adventurer in the late 15 century DR, owned a collection of dancing swords, including an intricately decorated dancing longsword with a blue gem in the hilt that could stun those that it struck, a sentient dancing rapier named Boris, and the unique sword of riotous revels gifted to her by Laeral Silverhand."
