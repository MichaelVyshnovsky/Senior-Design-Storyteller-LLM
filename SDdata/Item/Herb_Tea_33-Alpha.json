        "mainbody": "'''Herb Tea 33-Alpha''' was a herbal [[tea]] blend that could circumvent a [[giff]]'s resistance to certain kinds of restorative magic and medicine.",
        "Description": "Herb Tea 33-Alpha was prepared from a mix of [[elderberry|elderberries]], [[elderflower]], [[chamomile]], [[rose hip]]s, [[astragalus]], and [[echinacea]], which was wrapped in thin paper and left in hot water for 20 minutes.",
        "History": "When the giff mercenary commander Lieutenant [[Prook (giff)|Prook]] escaped from the slaver ship ''[[Er'lir Fezrrega'l]]'' after it crash-landed in [[Icewind Dale]], he carried written instructions detailing how to help him should he succumb to the elements. These instructions included what was referred to as \"Emergency Protocol 33-Alpha\", which called for the use of Herb Tea 33-Alpha, as most standard methods of restoration known on [[Toril]] wouldn't work on giff. A recipe for the tea was also included.{{Cite adventurers league/The Fallen Star|8-9}}"
