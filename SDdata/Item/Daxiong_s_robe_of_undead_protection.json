        "mainbody": "Daxiongs robe of undead protection was the unique enchanted robe that belonged to a necromancer who pioneered the art of improved zombification circa 1372 DR.\nThis black robe reeked of formaldehyde due to its owner being an experienced embalmer.\nDaxiongs robe of undead protection possessed a +2 enchantment but only when facing undead creatures. Additionally, this wizardly garb protected its wearer from ability, life energy, and experience drain and similar effects often inflicted by the restless dead. The robes complex magics prevented anyone but adepts of the arcane from tapping into its powers, as well as made it usable by creatures that venerated evil and malice.\nThe elven necromancer Daxiong hailed from the Dalelands, where he became obsessed with improving the process of zombification, creating the sturdier and more intelligent servants. His research led him to places with high mortality across the Realms, such as plagues and wars. He created countless variations of his arcane formula, meticulously numbering and marking his many creations. To protect himself from possibly aggressive experiments, he crafted Daxiongs robe of undead protection. He wore this enchanted robe in 1372 DR when he laired in the catacomb under Gillians Hill and was so close to finishing up his lifes work."
