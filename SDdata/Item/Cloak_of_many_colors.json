        "mainbody": "A '''''cloak of many colors''''' was a rare enchanted item that provided immunities to the wearer by shifting its color pigments.",
        "Description": "Though the cloak always looked the same to the wearer, others would see a constantly changing surface of swirling patterns.",
        "Powers": "The color-shifting of this item protected the wearer against the effects of a ''[[prismatic wall]]'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', and ''[[color spray]]'', and even allowed the wearer to pass through the ''prismatic'' barriers unhindered. The cloak also protected the wearer from blindness caused by [[spell]]s such as ''[[blur]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', and ''[[darkness]]'', as well as all other forms of blinding light.\n\nThe cloak's swirling surface made it slightly easier for the wearer to blend in with shadows. The cloak could glow similar to a ''[[light]]'' spell for nine minutes at a time once every two hours."
