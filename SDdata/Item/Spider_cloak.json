        "mainbody": "spider cloak was an enchanted cloak that likely fell into the possession of several adventurers in the late 15 century DR.\nSuch cloaks were dark red and had a brown spiderweb embroidered on their backs. The hood of the cloak was also decorated in a similar way.\nIt allowed its user to hide from opponents and avoid their successful attacks. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.\nIn the late 15 century DR, spider cloaks could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such items were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Deathsleep, the green dragon."
