        "mainbody": "Mangee was a board game played with a set of ten enchanted jade figurines that originated from the land of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur.\nMangee used a ten-sided board to play the game and needed a full set of twenty-five pieces. Each game piece was an expertly carved jade figurine of a creature, and each was enchanted with alteration, enchantment, and conjuration magics and was valued at 500 gold pieces. The figurines magic could only be used if all the pieces were assembled together, and no divination sorcery could reveal the magic before the set was completed.\nSome of the jade figurines were a dragon, a lion, an eagle, a monkey, and a bear.\nThe origins of Mangee were obscure but traceable to the Empire of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, long before the 14 century DR. An incomplete set of figurines was recovered in the mid-to-late 14 century DR by a band of heroes of the Living City. The Mangee statuettes were hidden in a cave in the mountains on the Vast inhabited by deadly creatures like chimerae and manticores."
