'''Undead grafts''' were body parts, organs, or other appendages formed of [[undead]] flesh that were [[graft]]ed onto a living creature.

==Description==
Grafting the flesh of undead creatures onto oneself could confer tremendous powers depending on the piece and the creature from which it had been taken.

Undead grafts were generally sought only by those who were desperately power-hungry or who revered undead. No sane person desired one, and any unfortunate individual who had one forced upon them was advised to find a way to remove it.

===Creation===
Creating undead grafts required vile procedures and pieces of bodies in perfect condition, often harvested from unwilling undead creatures. Attaching such an appendage (either to another or to oneself) required familiarity with medicine, access to spells relevant to the specific graft, specialized knowledge of how to attach such flesh to a body, and involved a complex and vile [[ritual]]. The procedure generally was conducted in a comfortable and quiet setting, such as a laboratory or [[evil]] temple.

The ''[[graft flesh]]'' spell could also be used to attach the limbs or skin of a corpse to a living creature, however this effect was only temporary.

==History==
Undead grafts were originally devised in experiments by [[necromancer]]s and [[priest]]s of [[Death domain|death]] who sought to remake their bodies in the form of undeath without actually dying first.

As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], undead grafts could be purchased at the [[Corpse Market]] in [[Evernight]] from merchants such as [[Sanjos Irridan]].
