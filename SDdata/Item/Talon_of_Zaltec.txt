A '''''talon of Zaltec''''' was a [[jaguar]] claw enchanted with the [[hishna]] [[spell]] ''[[create talisman]]''.

==Powers==
The tip of the talon contained anywhere from 1â€“10 doses of a lethal venom. The ''talon of [[Zaltec]]'' could be wielded in combat like a small melee weapon. A single scratch from the talon would be enough to kill.

The base of the claw contained a dangerous powder that could be cast into the eyes of a target up to {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} away to blind them for many hours.
