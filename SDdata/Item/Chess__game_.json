        "Description": "In Faerûn, chess was played on a checkered board with thirty-two pieces of six types: pawns, rooks (or castles), knights-errant (or knights), priests (or bishops), queens, and kings. The board was the same as that used in the simpler game of [[draughts]]/checkers, and was called a chess board or lanceboard. They usually came with the board in a wooden case.",
        "Rules": "The knight piece was known for jumping directly between squares.\n\nThere were regional variations to the rules. In [[Calimshan]], a piece must be moved once it had been touched, but that rule was not used in [[Cormyr]]. In Cormyr, a player needed to announce their move out loud but this could be neglected. In Cormyr, the black king piece was sometimes termed \"[[Gondegal]]\" after the rebel would-be king of [[1352 DR]].\n\nThere were many named tactics, such as the Theskan double-counter gambit.",

        "History": "The game known as chess, lanceboard, or castles was apparently based on the ancient [[elf|elven]] board game of ''[[Coroniir]]'', or \"crowns\" in [[Common]]. [[Lilianviaten Dlardrageth]] felt that [[human]]s had brutalized what [[elves]] had invented, as with most great things.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|1734}}\n\nChess was known in Chessenta (no relation) around the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. For example, during the reign of King [[Tchazzar]] ([[929 DR|929]]–[[1018 DR]]), the [[archmage]] [[Ultham|Ultham, son of Urrekanam]], spent many hours playing chess with the elders of the village of [[Oslin]], and created the ''Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre'' to protect his friends there before he journeyed into the [[planes]]. For several years, they were just used as simple chess pieces.\n\nChess was known in Cormyr by around [[1200 DR]].\n\nSome time in the 1300s DR, in The Salty Dog tavern in [[Ravens Bluff]], the mage [[Mastraero]] of [[Calaunt]] lost at chess to an unwashed sailor and in his rage turned every witness into a snail. But he missed his opponent, Ambassador [[Carrague]], who promptly restored everyone's proper forms, and they got their revenge.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, King [[Theris]] of [[Mourktar]] in [[Threskel]] held athletic competitions to choose his successor. Alongside archery, boxing, charioteering, discus, jumping, riding, running, swimming, and wrestling, chess was one of the events.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, in Cormyr, [[Vangerdahast]] and [[Dimswart]] played in Castle Obarskyr whilst discussing the Tuigan incursion with King Azoun.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[War Wizards]] [[Huldyl Rauthur]] and [[Kurthryn Shandarn]] played a game of chess whilst on guard duty in Castle Obarskyr during the [[abraxus affair]] and discussed the events of the time over it. Their game was interrupted by [[Gwennath]] announcing the death of Baron [[Thomdor Ammaeth]]. Huldyl surrendered when Kurthryn checked his king. Unknown to them, the [[Harper]] [[Emthrara Undril]] was shapeshifted as the white queen piece.{{Cite dragon/276/The New Adventures of Volo: Cormyrian Contracts|77}} Azoun played with [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] afterward, but won each time despite Giogi's tactics and research.",
