        "mainbody": "Salami was a type of preserved sausage found in the Western Heartlands, the Chionthar Valley, and the city of Baldurs Gate.\nSalami sausages were popular among adventurers due to their delicious taste and shelf-life. Some of these big sausages were so well-preserved and hardened they could be used as bludgeoning weapons, tough enough to knock a creature out cold."
