        "mainbody": "'''''Elemental's Ruin''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[adamantine]] [[rapier]] found in [[Rashemen]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Elemental's Ruin'' was an appropriate name for this rapier that could withstand and bypass [[elemental]] creatures' physical invulnerabilities. When wielded against elementals, this weapon damaged their core essence, allowing the wielder to perform surprise attacks and deal devastating damage as if the elementals were beings of flesh and blood. When wielded against non-elementals, this rapier acted as an enchanted ''+3 [[keen]]'' weapon, but when wielded against elementals, it became a devastating weapon with a ''+5'' enchantment.",
        "History": "One ''Elemental's Ruin'' rapier was stored within a burial burrow in Rashemen, north of the city of [[Mulsantir]], where the great spirit [[Okku]] rested until the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. It was believed that the [[elemental lords]], who hated each other, were united in their common disdain for these weapons and sought to destroy every single ''Elemental's Ruin''."
