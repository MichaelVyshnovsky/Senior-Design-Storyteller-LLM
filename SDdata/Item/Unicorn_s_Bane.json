        "mainbody": "Unicorns Bane was the name eventually given to one of the Qysari Rings belonging to the wicked Shoon VII of the Shoon Imperium. It allowed the wearer to short-range teleport to within a few yards (meters) of a named individual, a member of a chosen race, or a specimen of a selected species.\nMagic rings made during the sixth age of Calimshan (27 â€“ 450 DR), were constructed of twisted bands of two different metals and were known as shoonrings. What distinguished the Qysari Rings from ordinary shoonrings was that they changed appearance depending on the nature of the person wearing them. When placed on the finger of a cleric, druid, or other priest, the direction of the metal weave turned at right angles to the circumference of the ring. If donned by warriors or rogues, the raised weave pattern became smooth to the touch but still visible. Wizards saw no change in the design when it was placed on their finger.\nThis ring was a very specialized ring of teleportation that had a range of only two miles (a little over three kilometers) but could transport the wearer into close proximity of a named individual, a member of a race, or a specimen of a selected species. The named target had to be known to the wearer of the ring, so, for example, the wearer could not jump to a derro if he or she had never met a derro before. If the spoken target was present within the range of the ring, the wearer would appear no less than 11 ft (3.4 m) and no more than 30 ft (9.1 m) away from the closest creature that fit the description.\nThis ring was made for Shoon VII,\nIn the Year of Mourning Horns, 355 DR, he used this ring to eradicate the unicorn population of Shilmista forest and massacre their elvish druid caretakers. From the spoils of this butchery, he created the Tome of the Unicorn and the Staff of Shoon.\nThe ring presumably remained in his possession even after he faked his own death and his subsequent achievement of lichdom. Over the next seven hundred years, he deteriorated into a demilich and it was believed that he hid most of his magical treasures in caches around the Shoon empire so they would not fall into the claws of Iryklathagra,"
