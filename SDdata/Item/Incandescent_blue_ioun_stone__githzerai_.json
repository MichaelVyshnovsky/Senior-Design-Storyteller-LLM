        "mainbody": "his incandescent blue ioun stone was a unique ioun stone created by the githzerai that boosted the wisdom of the bearer.\nIt was a spherical blue stone, weighing 1 lb (453 g).\nWhen attuned, the incandescent blue ioun stone increased the owners wisdom.\nIn a past age, in a realm beyond the Astral Plane, the githzerai craftsman Bashenee created an incandescent blue ioun stone for a great githzerai monk, who later fell in battle with githyanki. \nThe stone circulated among the githyanki for many years, until it was given to the mind flayer Oinchackolp, who treated it as a prized possession.\nAround 1311 DR in Icewind Dale, Oinchackolp was roaming the Underdark beneath Icewind Dale when he lost the ioun stone, and some driders found it. Oinchackolp ordered some passing adventurers to retrieve it from the driders lair."
