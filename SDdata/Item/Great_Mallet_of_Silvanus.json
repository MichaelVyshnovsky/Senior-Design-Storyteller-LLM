Its wielder could also cast ''[[call lightning]]'' once per minute, shoot out a fast-flowing stream of water out to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in a cone that was {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in a diameter, or call upon Silvanus's unshakingly faithful [[wolf]]hound.\n\nThis wolfhound had a low level of intelligence, above that of the average wolf. It slowly regenerated over the course of a battle. And not even controlling [[magic]]s or [[psionics]] could break its loyalty to Silvanus."
