        "mainbody": "The great mallet of Silvanus was a magical mallet wielded by the Young Strider avatar form of the Faer√ªnian power known as Silvanus.\nThis weapon originally had a +5 enchantment, but in later years was reduced to being +2. Its wielder could also cast call lightning once per minute, shoot out a fast-flowing stream of water out to  in a cone that was  in a diameter, or call upon Silvanuss unshakingly faithful wolfhound.\nThis wolfhound had a low level of intelligence, above that of the average wolf. It slowly regenerated over the course of a battle. And not even controlling magics or psionics could break its loyalty to Silvanus."
