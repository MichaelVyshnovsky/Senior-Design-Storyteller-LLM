An '''''apparatus of Gond''''' was a large, metallic vehicle developed in the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]] by master [[artificer]]s of the [[Church of Gond]] as an homage to the famous ''[[apparatus of Kwalish]]''.

==Description==
These contraptions lacked the central porthole, dual periscope eyes, and rear exhaust-pipe that an ''apparatus of Kwalish'' exhibited. Instead they sported four small portholes in the front, which glowed with the interior light, and a rear extension resembling the tail of a [[giant lobster]].

==Varieties==

;Embellished: These versions of the ''apparatus of Gond'' were burnished, sporting a shiny new finish, and etched with intricate designs. They also sported additional vents, meant to expose the magical blue glow illuminating the vessel's interior.
;Red-Hued: Nearly identical to the standard ''apparatus of Gond'', except their bronze finish had been replaced with a bright red hue and silvery metal.

==Trivia==
Some Gondsmen were known to have created miniature, toy versions of these apparatuses.
