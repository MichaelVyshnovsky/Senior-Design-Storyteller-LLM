An apparatus of Gond was a large, metallic vehicle developed in the late-15 century DR by master artificers of the Church of Gond as an homage to the famous apparatus of Kwalish.
These contraptions lacked the central porthole, dual periscope eyes, and rear exhaust-pipe that an apparatus of Kwalish exhibited. Instead they sported four small portholes in the front, which glowed with the interior light, and a rear extension resembling the tail of a giant lobster.

Embellished These versions of the apparatus of Gond were burnished, sporting a shiny new finish, and etched with intricate designs. They also sported additional vents, meant to expose the magical blue glow illuminating the vessels interior.
Red-Hued Nearly identical to the standard apparatus of Gond, except their bronze finish had been replaced with a bright red hue and silvery metal.
Some Gondsmen were known to have created miniature, toy versions of these apparatuses.
