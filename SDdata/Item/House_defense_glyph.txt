'''''House defense glyphs''''' were one of the three types of ''[[drow rune]]s'' used by [[drow]], the other two being ''[[sacred glyph]]s'' and ''[[way-marker rune]]s''.

==Description==
''Drow runes'' were always limned in black, be it with [[ink]], paste, or inlay. The runes were elegant. They were made to look like flags or ornamentation around the symbol of a noble house.

==Powers==
A ''house defense glyph'' stored [[magic]] and unleashed it when triggered. The magic was triggered when someone who did not own the proper ''[[drow house insignia]]'' or did not say the password disturbed them. The powers of ''way-marker runes'' and the following powers were commonly stored into the ''house defense glyphs'': a ''[[color spray]]'' effect, an ''[[enervation]]'' effect, a ''[[dispel magic]]'' effect; a ''[[magic reflection]]'' effect, an ''[[antimagic shell]]'' effect, a ''[[magic missile]]'' effect, a black fist effect that worked like a ''[[Bigby's clenched fist]]'', or a ''[[blade barrier]]'' effect. They were not limited to these, and [[wizard]]s and [[runecaster]]s devised new ones.

==History==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the technique to create ''sacred glyphs'' was already old.
