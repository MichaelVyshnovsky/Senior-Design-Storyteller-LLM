It had a handle to which was attached a blade that was curved in more or less a semicircle, coming to a sharp point.\nBecause of its shape, the sickle could also be used in trip attacks. \nThe sickle was preferred by druids and by people who wanted to carry a weapon yet remain inconspicuous to guards. \n* Black sickle\n* Golden sickle\n* Sickle of Careful Kindness\n* Sickle of Shorn Bonds"
