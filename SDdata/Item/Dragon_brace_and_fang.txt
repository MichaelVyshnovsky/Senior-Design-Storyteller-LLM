Dragon brace and fang was the title given to a mighty shield and its companion short sword, both of which were sized for a halfling.
The powerful combination of these two flaming pieces of equipment allowed the wielder to land a flurry of mighty blows against many different enemies in quick succession.
The dragon brace and fang were made from the shattered remains of a longsword and kite shield that were destroyed by a red dragon. These were reforged into new pieces that were half the size but twice as strong.
* Tommus Tallstep, a halfling fighter and adventurer active in Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR.
