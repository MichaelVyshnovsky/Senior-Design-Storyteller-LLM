'''''Dragon brace and fang''''' was the title given to a mighty [[shield]] and its companion [[short sword]], both of which were sized for a [[halfling]].

==Powers==
The powerful combination of these two [[flaming]] pieces of equipment allowed the wielder to land a flurry of mighty blows against many different enemies in quick succession.

==History==
The ''dragon brace and fang'' were made from the shattered remains of a [[longsword]] and [[tower shield|kite shield]] that were destroyed by a [[red dragon]]. These were reforged into new pieces that were half the size but twice as strong.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Tommus Tallstep]], a halfling [[fighter]] and [[adventurer]] active in [[Waterdeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
