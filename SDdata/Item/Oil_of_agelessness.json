        "Powers": "Applying one vial of an ''oil of agelessness'' to the body of a [[human]] or [[demihuman]] was said to interrupt their bodies' aging process, delaying it by six months. If one applied this oil to them continuously, they could theoretically maintain their youth indefinitely.",
        "Creation": "''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], the process of brewing an ''oil of agelessness'' was a closely guarded secret of the [[priest|priestesses]] of [[Ishtar]], highly sought after by those who dabbled in [[southern magic]]. The only ingredient of the oils that was known to outsiders was nectar from [[rose]]s cultivated in the gardens of Isthar in Unther."
