'''''Forest Walkers''''' were [[enchanted]] [[boot]]s used by [[Rashemaar]] foresters.

==Powers==
These powerful boots possessed a collection of enchantments that made it easy for the wearers to dance freely across even the most overgrown and thorny dense forests. They dramatically improved wearers' dexterity and granted them magical protection against bludgeoning damage. Additionally, the wearer was able to cast the ''[[freedom of movement]]'' [[spell]] thrice per day.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Forest Walkers'' were used by Rashemaar [[berserker]]s stationed in the Ashenwood's [[Lake of Tears Garrison]], a Rashemi fort led by a [[wychlaran]] named [[Dalenka]]. [[Odesya]], the fort's requisitions officer, offered a pair of the magic boots for sale to the fort's allies.
