'''Redcloths''' were red-hued pieces of fabric worn inside the [[clout|undergarments]] by [[:Category:Females|women]] of the Realms during their menstruation.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/02-20 - Lingerie, Courtship and Foreplay}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Body Hair and Menstrual Cycles}} They were used as a single layer or as a pair, and were sold by most [[inn]]s and [[tavern]]s during the day.

==Usage==
Redcloths were washed daily in scented water or cheap wine, and rinsed in clear water (such as collected rain water). There was no social stigma attached to this act, and finding washing facilities in civilized areas such as towns or cities was an easy task: this service was provided by every inn regardless of standing.

Women traveling the wilderness would wash redcloths in any sort of water, even using dew or stagnant swampwater. If no water could be found, old redcloths were buried to avoid being tracked by predators relying on scent.

Old redcloths that couldn't be used anymore were disposed of by tavern owners, usually becoming scrubbing rags.
