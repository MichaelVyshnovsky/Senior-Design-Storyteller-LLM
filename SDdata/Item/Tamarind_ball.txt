Tamarind balls were delicious little morsels sold at the Drovers Last Drink tavern in Mosstone in the 14 century DR.
Tamarind balls were small handpie-sized pastries, richly spiced with tamarind and rolled into balls. These balls were cooked to soft, chewy perfection and dusted with sugar. The pastrys sweetness was pleasantly cut with tamarinds spiciness.
With the merchants and travelers on the Trade Way, the culinary influence of Calimshan and Tashalar spread to some locations in neighboring Tethyr, notably the Mosstone caravan stop village on the shore of Firedrake Bay. Tamarind was likely introduced to the proprietors of Drovers Last Drink through trade and culinary cross-pollination. Eventually, this led to the creation of the tamarind balls that were quite exotic in taste and impressed Volothamp Geddarm greatly during his research for one of his many guides in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
