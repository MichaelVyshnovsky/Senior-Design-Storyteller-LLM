        "mainbody": "An everburning torch was simply an ordinary torch enchanted by the continual flame spell, such that it burned constantly with a heatless flame that required no oxygen or fuel.\nAn everburning torch cast light out to a distance of about 40 feet (12 meters). It weighed about 1 pound (0.5 kilograms) and sold for about 110 gold pieces in most places. The light from the flame could be covered and hidden but not extinguished.\nThere are many examples of everburning torches in the Realms by the early 1370s DR. They provided light to the great stairwells of the tree-temple of Teumyshaaril within the elven city of Teuveamanthaar in the High Forest. Ensconced everburning torches illuminated the interior of the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon. The Shadovar used them to light the quarters of their earth genasi slaves during their excavation of the Crypt of Augathra the Mad. The Temple of Bane buried beneath Castle Krag in Shadowdale was lit by green everburning torches. Captain Serag Kull of Hillsfar carried such a torch among his possessions."
