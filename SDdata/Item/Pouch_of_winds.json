        "mainbody": "A '''''pouch of winds''''' was a magical bag that, when opened, allowed its holder to summon a strong wind to the aid or detriment of sailing ships.",
        "Appearance": "This [[magic]]al item looked like an ordinary [[leather]] [[pouch]] that was full to the point of bulging with its contents.",
        "Function": "When a ''pouch of winds'' was opened, the user would decide if ''favorable'' or ''contrary'' winds were wanted. If the former was chosen, the current weather conditions would change a strong and steady gust blew in the direction that they chose. If the latter was selected, a wind of the same force would blow against the current direction of any ship in sight of the user. In either case, the winds would last for 2&ndash;24 hours, after which they would return to their original course and patterns.",
        "Creation": "These pouches were created with use of the [[spell]] ''[[wind wall]]''."
