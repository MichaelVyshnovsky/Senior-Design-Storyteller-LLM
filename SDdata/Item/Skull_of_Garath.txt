The '''''Skull of Garath''''' was one of the possessions of the dervish [[cleric]] [[Corga Kazan]] in {{yearlink|1356}}. He kept it in his quarters within the [[Temple of Set]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|76}}

==Description==
The skull appeared [[human]], but its fangs were oversized, its features distorted, and it had three short horns. It had a strange red glow, capable of filling a room.

==Powers==
The skull could, five times per day, cast both ''[[cause fear]]'' and ''[[animate dead]]''. It could also once per month be used to contact [[Khalitharius]]. Only [[cleric]] who followed evil deities could use it; any other clerics were damaged when its powers were used.

==History==
As of {{yearlink|1356}}, the dervish cleric Corga Kazan kept one of those within his sanctum in the Temple of Set.
