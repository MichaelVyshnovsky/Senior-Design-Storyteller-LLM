'''Potato porridge''' was a common simple dish found in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''The only limit to a potato recipe is the cook's imagination.''}}

==Description==
These stewed starchy [[potato]] bowls were served in eateries of [[Baldur's Gate]], settlements along the [[Chionthar Vallery]], and [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn along the [[Risen Road]]. The porridge was sprinkled with [[herb]]s and diced [[yam]]s.
