Potato porridge was a common simple dish found in the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR.
These stewed starchy potato bowls were served in eateries of Baldurs Gate, settlements along the Chionthar Vallery, and Waukeens Rest inn along the Risen Road. The porridge was sprinkled with herbs and diced yams.
