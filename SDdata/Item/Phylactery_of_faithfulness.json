        "mainbody": "A phylactery of faithfulness was a useful item for divine spellcasters, in that it enabled the wearer to foresee how their actions would affect their connection to their deity.\nA phylactery of faithfulness took the form of a small box holding religious scripture. It was tied around the forehead by a leather cord attached to the box. There was no non-magical way to determine precisely what it did until it was worn.\nTo create a phylactery of faithfulness, the creator must cast detect evil, detect good, detect law, and detect chaos during the process.\nIf the wearer of a phylactery of faithfulness considered an intended action or use of an item beforehand, then they were alerted if that action or item would have a negative impact on their relationship with their deity or on their alignment.\n* Haroistem, a priest of Lathander. Granted by the god himself, it also provided him with continuous augury.\n* Shahpesh, a Zakharan moralist\nA phylactery of faithfulness was hidden in the Kings Tower of Uthtower."
