The Soul of the Earth was an ancient and magical stone that allowed the user to scry on anyone who left behind an arrow or other projectile.
It was a polished piece of volcanic rock.
The Soul of the Earth granted its wielder a vision of whoever had fired a given projectile, affixing their image in the wielders mind and making them easier to track.
* The legendary druid Dawan Pax used the Soul of the Earth to hunt hunters.
