The '''''Soul of the Earth''''' was an ancient and [[magic]]al stone that allowed the user to [[scry]] on anyone who left behind an [[arrow]] or other projectile.

==Description==
It was a polished piece of [[obsidian|volcanic rock]].

==Powers==
The ''Soul of the Earth'' granted its wielder a vision of whoever had fired a given projectile, affixing their image in the wielder's mind and making them easier to track.

==Notable Owners==
* The legendary [[druid]] [[Dawan Pax]] used the ''Soul of the Earth'' to hunt hunters.
