It may be that this is only a particular example of a ''quiver of plenty''.\n\nIn [[1356 DR]], the [[Companions of the Hall]] explored the ruins of Mithril Hall and [[Regis]] discovered ''Taulmaril'' and the quiver in a crack in a stone wall. They gave both quiver and bow to [[Catti-brie]], and she went on to use both in many battles.",
