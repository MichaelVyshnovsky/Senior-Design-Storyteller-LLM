'''''Harvest cloaks''''' were [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s, the prize awarded annually to the winning team of [[West Harbor]]'s [[Harvest Fair]] competition.

==Description==
''Harvest cloaks'' were masterfully crafted, simple but beautiful green cloaks.

==Powers==
These clothing items were imbued with a simple charisma boosting [[enchantment]] that accentuated ''Harvest cloaks''' beauty, drew the eye, and complimented any outfit paired with them.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], a ''Harvest cloak'' and the ''[[Harvest Cup]]'' were awarded the competition's winners, [[Amie Fern]], [[Bevil Starling]], and [[Kalach-Cha]]. Following a devastating attack on the town of West Harbor, Kalach-Cha took the ''Harvest cloak'' out of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] and headed to [[Neverwinter]].
