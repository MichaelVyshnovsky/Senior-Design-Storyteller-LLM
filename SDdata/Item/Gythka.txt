A '''gythka''' was a type of exotic weapon invented by the [[thri-kreen]] and unique to them.

It was a long, two-handed [[polearm]] with a crescent-shaped blade mounted on each end. These dealt deep slashing wounds. A highly trained warrior could fight with both ends at once. It could also be hurled as a spear. It was much more familiar to the thri-kreen, who, with four arms, could wield two gythkas simultaneously.

Collectors would buy these weapons if they were in good condition.
