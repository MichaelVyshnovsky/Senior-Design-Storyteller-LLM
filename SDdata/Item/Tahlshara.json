        "mainbody": "'''Tahlshara''' was a magic [[two-handed sword]] sometimes considered to be the greatest [[elven]] weapon ever made. It was one of the three [[Great Treasures of Evermeet]] and was possessed by [[Queen Amlaruil Moonflower]].",
        "Description": "It had leaves and vines carved into its surface with knotwork on the hilt. The name of the sword was present around the [[Wiktionary:ferrule|ferrule]].",
        "Powers": "The weapon drastically improved its wielder's armor and could only be wielded by surface elves. Death was often the result of a non-elf handling it. The sword could be used to cast any high magic [[spell]], or any of ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[spellstrike]]'', ''[[sunburst]]'', ''[[spelltrap]]'', ''[[turnshadow]]'', or ''[[teleport dead]]''.",
        "History": "The sword was the life's work of the elven armorer [[Kythaela Durothil]]. It was thought that its creation took over one hundred and fifty years and that Kythaela deliberately extended her life to complete it."
