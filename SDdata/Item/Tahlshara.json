        "mainbody": "ahlshara was a magic two-handed sword sometimes considered to be the greatest elven weapon ever made. It was one of the three Great Treasures of Evermeet and was possessed by Queen Amlaruil Moonflower.\nIt had leaves and vines carved into its surface with knotwork on the hilt. The name of the sword was present around the ferrule.\nThe weapon drastically improved its wielders armor and could only be wielded by surface elves. Death was often the result of a non-elf handling it. The sword could be used to cast any high magic spell, or any of teleport without error, spellstrike, sunburst, spelltrap, turnshadow, or teleport dead. \nThe sword was the lifes work of the elven armorer Kythaela Durothil. It was thought that its creation took over one hundred and fifty years and that Kythaela deliberately extended her life to complete it."
