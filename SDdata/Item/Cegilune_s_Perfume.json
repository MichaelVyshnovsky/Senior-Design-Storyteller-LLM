        "mainbody": "Cegilunes Perfume was a unique magic ring that bore the name of the goddess mother of hags, Cegilune, part of the Fading Rings set.\nThis crude-looking, faintly glowing ring gave the wearer the power to cast the repulsion spell at its full strength in exchange for reducing the users charisma.\nIn 1369 DR, Cegilunes Perfume came to be possessed by a mysterious monument, the Great Stone Head, located in the Nightingale Court in the ruins of Myth Drannor. In exchange for one of the eidolons, small totem statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings, one being the Cegilunes Perfume."
