        "Powers": "This crude-looking, faintly glowing ring gave the wearer the power to cast the ''[[repulsion]]'' spell at its full strength in exchange for reducing the user's charisma.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Cegilune's Perfume'' came to be possessed by a mysterious monument, ''the Great Stone Head'', located in the [[Nightingale Court]] in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. In exchange for one of the ''[[eidolon]]s'', small totem statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings, one being the ''Cegilune's Perfume''."
