'''''Lanterns of revealing''''' were [[enchanted]] [[hooded lantern]]s that allowed the user to ''[[Dispel magic|dispel]]'' ''[[invisibility]]''.

==Description==
''Lanterns of revealing'' were regular hooded lanterns in appearance.

==Powers==
With a spoken command word, these lanterns were lit with magics that ''[[Invisibility purge|purged invisibility]]'' off of all things and creatures that were illuminated. ''Lanterns of revealing'' required [[oil]] to burn and could sustain its flames up to six hours fro one pint of it. These lanterns illuminated {{SI|25'|'"|long=yes}} - {{SI|30'|'"|long=yes}} radius and created dim light for {{SI|30'|'"|long=yes}} more. With lowered lantern hood, its light only reached {{SI|5'|'"|long=yes}}.

==Creation==
''Lanterns of revealing'' could be created by experienced wondrous item crafters and the use of ''invisibility purge'' spell.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Torleth Mindulspeer]]: the antique and curio dealer from [[Gillian's Hill]] kept one of the ''lanterns of revealing'', along with a ''[[necklace of fireballs]]'', and the original [[Greatshout as a Young Man]], in his trapped vault under [[Torleth's Treasures]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].
*[[Tchazzar]]: the Chosen of [[Tiamat]] had a ''lantern of revealing'' in his horde along with many more precious and rare magical items ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].
