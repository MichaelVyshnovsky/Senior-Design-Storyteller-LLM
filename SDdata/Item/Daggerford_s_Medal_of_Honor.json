        "mainbody": "Daggerfords medal of honor was an enchanted amulet that was presented as the decoration of the highest honor for individuals who performed significant acts of valor in service of Daggerford.\nDaggerfords medal of honor was a shining and well-polished item.\nDaggerfords medal of honor possessed an enchantment that improved the wearers defense against creatures not native to the Prime Material plane, as well as improving their charisma, persuasion, and general defenses against magical and mundane effects. Additionally, the medal of honor allowed the wearer to cast the aura of glory spell once per day.\nIn 1372 DR, Daggerfords medal of honor was presented to the hero of Daggerford and their companions, Purfbin Doogrick and Raegen Brunegar by Duke Pwyll Daggerford for the groups heroic deeds of rescuing the Duke and his sister from the Zhentarim, removing the organizations puppet city leader, and stopping the vengeful pit fiend Gorgomorz from razing Daggerford to the ground.\nThe fame of the baatezus defeat spread throughout the Abyss and denizens of the lower planes knew the medal and were fearful of its owner."
