        "Powers": "''Gandrel's Aspiration'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that guided the [[bolt]]s towards their targets and increased their damage. The crossbow also possessed magic that made it especially effective against [[monstrosities]].",
        "History": "Gandrel named his heavy crossbow after the incident he witnessed at seven years old – a [[vampire spawn]] being burned at the stake. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Gur carried this crossbow while hunting for the vampire spawn named [[Astarion Ancunín]] across the [[Western Heartlands]] and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
