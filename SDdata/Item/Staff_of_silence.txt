The staff of silence was a magical staff that completely negated any noise made by its bearer.
In addition to negating all sound made by the bearer, a staff of silence could imbue the bearer with deafness, effectively making them immune to any form of sound-based attack to include any power word spells.
The bearer could release the stored sonic energy of the staff in a focused attack once per day, causing a high-pitched shriek that caused physical harm and deafened and stunned any targets nearby.
The staff of silence originated in Myth Drannor.
