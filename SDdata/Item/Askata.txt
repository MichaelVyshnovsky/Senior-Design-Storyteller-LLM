'''Askata''' was a strong easily crumbled yellow [[cheese]] from [[Impiltur]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-02-24 - Elturian Grey and Green Calishite}}

==Description==
Askata was crumbly and had a strong taste. It was created by blending [[goat's milk|goat]] and [[cow]] [[milk]] with addition of a certain type of [[moss]] that was later removed from the liquid before fermentation started. The resulting cheese melted smoothly and had a noticeable [[cheddar]] taste with an added flavor of roasted [[almond]]s that became stronger with age.

It was commonly served at the [[Swords Meet]] in [[Voonlar]] accompanying [[venison]] meat and [[mushroom]]s cooked in red [[wine]]. [[Human]] nobles considered askata cooked in wine to be "wonderful", while some of the [[hin]] tasters thought the dish to be "vomitous."
