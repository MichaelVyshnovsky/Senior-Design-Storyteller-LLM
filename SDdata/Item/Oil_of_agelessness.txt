Oil of agelessness was a magical oil found only in the land of Unther.
Applying one vial of an oil of agelessness to the body of a human or demihuman was said to interrupt their bodies aging process, delaying it by six months. If one applied this oil to them continuously, they could theoretically maintain their youth indefinitely.
Circa 1357 DR, the process of brewing an oil of agelessness was a closely guarded secret of the priestesses of Ishtar, highly sought after by those who dabbled in southern magic. The only ingredient of the oils that was known to outsiders was nectar from roses cultivated in the gardens of Isthar in Unther.
