        "mainbody": "he Grail of Shargrailar was an enchanted drinking horn made from one of the horns of Shargrailar, the first and most powerful dracolich.\nCarved from one of the horns of the slain undead red dragon, it was hollowed out and polished, then lined with platinum and encrusted with small jewels.\nThough it was but an ordinary drinking vessel, the horn had lingering psychic auras of evil and necromantic magic.\nAfter Shandril Shessair, Narm Tamaraith, and Delg Ironstar destroyed Shargrailar on Flamerule 9 in the , on the East Way near Thunder Gap,It is unknown who took the horn as a trophy or why they made it into a drinking vessel this event is not depicted in the novel Spellfire where Shargrailar appeared and was destroyed.\nIn the early 1370s DR, Winn Kardzen, the leader of the Cult of the Dragons Glarondan cell, was on the verge of convincing the fang dragon Nartheling to accept transformation into a dracolich. However, to seal the deal, he needed a phylactery worthy of the dragons essence and so sought out a relic of the right fame and nature. He more than succeeded, locating the Grail of Shargrailar.\nAfter his agents obtained the Grail and shipped it to Velprintalar in Aglarond, circa 1372 DR, Winn hired the merchant Tulin Farweather to transport it to Glarondar, so as not to attract unwanted attention. However, it was lost en routeâ€”unknown to all, when the caravan carrying the horn made camp near a stone circle in the Yuirwood, the undead star elf Mourel Duskwalker emerged from a nearby portal to the Night Realm, stole the Grail, and retreated with it back to his demiplane. He had hopes of performing a ritual to tap into its innate power. Mourel stored it in one of the burial niches in his vault.\nAfterward, not knowing what had happened, Tulin would try to hire adventurers to find the lost horn, offering a reward of 2,000 gp."
