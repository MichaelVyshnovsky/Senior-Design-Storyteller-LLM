        "mainbody": "The '''''Grail of Shargrailar''''' was an [[enchanted]] drinking horn made from one of the horns of [[Shargrailar]], the first and most powerful [[dracolich]].",
        "Description": "Carved from one of the horns of the slain [[undead]] [[red dragon]], it was hollowed out and polished, then lined with [[platinum]] and encrusted with small [[jewel]]s.",
        "Powers": "Though it was but an ordinary drinking vessel, the horn had lingering psychic auras of [[evil]] and [[necromancy|necromantic magic]].",
        "History": "After [[Shandril Shessair]], [[Narm Tamaraith]], and [[Delg Ironstar]] destroyed Shargrailar on [[Flamerule 9]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, on the [[East Way]] near [[Thunder Gap]],It is unknown who took the horn as a trophy or why they made it into a drinking vessel; this event is not depicted in the novel ''[[Spellfire (novel)|Spellfire]]'' where Shargrailar appeared and was destroyed.\n\nIn the early 1370s DR, [[Winn Kardzen]], the leader of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s [[Glarondan cell]], was on the verge of convincing the [[fang dragon]] [[Nartheling]] to accept transformation into a [[dracolich]]. However, to seal the deal, he needed a [[phylactery]] worthy of the [[dragon]]'s essence and so sought out a relic of the right fame and nature. He more than succeeded, locating the ''Grail of Shargrailar''.\n\nAfter his agents obtained the ''Grail'' and shipped it to [[Velprintalar]] in [[Aglarond]], ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], Winn hired the merchant [[Tulin Farweather]] to transport it to [[Glarondar]], so as not to attract unwanted attention. However, it was lost ''en route''â€”unknown to all, when the caravan carrying the horn made camp near a stone circle in the [[Yuirwood]], the [[undead]] [[star elf]] [[Mourel Duskwalker]] emerged from a nearby ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Night Realm]], stole the ''Grail'', and retreated with it back to his [[demiplane]]. He had hopes of performing a ritual to tap into its innate power. Mourel stored it in one of the burial niches in his vault.\n\nAfterward, not knowing what had happened, Tulin would try to hire [[adventurer]]s to find the lost horn, offering a reward of 2,000 [[gp]]."
