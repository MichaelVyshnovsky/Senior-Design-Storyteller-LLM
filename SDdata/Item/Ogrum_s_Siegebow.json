        "Powers": "Despite ''Ogrum's Siegebow'' being slightly harder to aim with, missiles that left the weapon packed a ''[[mighty]]'' wallop, similar to that of a powerful ''+6'' enchantment. Additionally, the crossbow generated an infinite supply of ''[[bolt of fire|bolts of fire]]''.",
        "History": "''Ogrum's Siegebow'' was a mystery, and its origins were unknown. The first time the weapon appeared was in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, when Slogg Ogrum singlehandedly besieged the town of [[Priapurl]] in the [[Eastern Heartlands]]. When the orc was defeated with the help of the [[Mindgulph Mercenary Company]], Ogrum's vast arsenal of weapons was uncovered, however, no one really uncovered the reasons for the orc's siege of the town.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Ogrum's Siegebow'' was sold in [[Westgate]], among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's [[Market Triangle]]."
