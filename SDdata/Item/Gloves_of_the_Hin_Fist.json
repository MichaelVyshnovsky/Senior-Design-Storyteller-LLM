        "mainbody": "The '''''Gloves of the Hin Fist''''' were enchanted gloves created for the use of the [[monk]]s of the [[Hin Fist]] monastic order.",
        "Powers": "These monk gloves were enchanted to improve the hand-to-hand combat prowess of its wearer, making it easier to land a strike on their targets, deal more damage, and enhance their strikes with sonic energy.",
        "History": "The ''Gloves of the Hin Fist'' were developed by an isolationist offshoot of the [[halfling]] monastic order, the [[Hin Fist]]. In seclusion from outsiders, they believed that one had to master the self before being able to master the outside. Therefore, the monks used these gloves to forewarn others of the halflings' fighting prowess in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century, these gloves received a wide popularity among adventuring monks of various orders and races. Copies of these enchanted gloves could be found in various locations across the [[Sword Coast]], in big cities like [[Neverwinter]], and in the [[Moonsea]] region."
