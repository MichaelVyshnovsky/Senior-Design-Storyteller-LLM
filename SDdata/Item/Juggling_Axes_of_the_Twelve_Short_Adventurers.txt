Juggling Axes of the Twelve Short Adventurers were magical throwing axes used by the jugglers of the popular halfling circus troupe Twelve Short Adventurers of the Nelanther Isles.
Juggling Axes of the Twelve Short Adventurers possessed a +1 magical enchantment and dealt additional magic damage to its target. These "juggling" axes were designed to be used by a halfling hand only.
Around 1372 DR, these magical axes could be purchased from the pirates and traders of the Nelanther Isles Spindrift Town.
