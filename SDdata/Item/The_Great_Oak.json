        "Powers": "''The Great Oak'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment. When the wearer was battling giants, the ''Oak'' effectively became a ''+4'' enchanted set of armor.",
        "History": "''The Great Oak'' armors were created sometime before [[1372 DR]]. A group of rogue [[giant]]s uprooted several of the oldest [[oak]] trees in the grove under Birch's protection. Outraged and burning with revenge, Birch enlisted a group of [[ranger]]s to stand against the giants. To help its new allies, the treant gathered all of its magical energy to enchant the suits of armor the rangers wore. Together, they defeated the giants and drove them back to the north. The tale of the encounter was still retold among the giants of the [[north Faer√ªn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nBy 1372 DR, the sets of enchanted armor, each known as ''The Great Oak'', were scattered across the lands. One of these items was in possession of [[Ballard]], a [[druid]] merchant from [[Port Llast]] on the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], another set of ''the Great Oak'' armor found its way into [[Hillsfar]]."
