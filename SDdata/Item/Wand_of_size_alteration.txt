A '''''wand of size alteration''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[wand]] allowing the wielder to change the size of other creatures.

==Powers==
This wand allowed the wielder to influence the size of a target creature similar to either the ''[[enlarge]]'' or ''[[reduce]]'' [[spell]], affecting a 50% change in the target's size and all of their carried equipment. The relative strength of the creature would change accordingly. The target needed to be within {{SI|10|ft}} for the magic to function.

The effects of a ''wand of size alteration'' could be cancelled by a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell, but doing so ran the risk of traumatically shocking the target. These wands could be recharged by [[wizard]]s and each use of the wand used a single charge.

==Notable Owners==
[[Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali]], the Grandfather of the [[Everlasting]] in [[Zakhara]], carried a ''wand of size alteration''.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Cardsheets}}
