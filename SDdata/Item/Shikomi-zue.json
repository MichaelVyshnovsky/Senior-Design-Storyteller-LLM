        "mainbody": "A shikomi-zue () was a weapon used in Kara-Tur, primarily by ninjas and sohei.\nAt first glance, a shikomi-zue appeared as a regular staff. However, a spring-loaded spear head was hidden within. The spear head sprung forth by either pressing a button or twisting the shaft. Other weapons could be concealed with the staff such as chains or hooks. A shikomi-zue was made from either bamboo or wood and was about  in length. Assembling the weapon took about a week."
