        "Description": "At first glance, a shikomi-zue appeared as a regular staff. However, a spring-loaded spear head was hidden within. The spear head sprung forth by either pressing a button or twisting the shaft. Other weapons could be concealed with the staff such as chains or hooks. A shikomi-zue was made from either [[bamboo]] or wood and was about {{SI|6|ft}} in length. Assembling the weapon took about a week."
