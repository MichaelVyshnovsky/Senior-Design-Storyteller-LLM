        "mainbody": "'''Hard-tack''', sometimes called '''hardtack''', was a dry unseasoned water-and-flour biscuit. It was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.",
        "Description": "The biscuits were dry and bland. However, due to its extraordinary resilience, hard-tack was a popular choice for long sea voyages. It was also a common component of travelers' [[ration]]s.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some claimed that [[Valkur]], the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian god]] of sailors, would on occasion manifest striding across the waves pulling a small boat filled with [[cask]]s of water and sea biscuits to feed all sailors that fell overboard."
