Solemn Duty was a magical katana.
The katanas blade was perfectly sharp, allowing its wielder to easily decapitate foes. The words "Solemn Duty" were etched into the blade, and the hilt was engraved with markings.
As indiciated by the engravings on its hilt, Solemn Duty was enchanted to be especially powerful against inhabitants of the outer planes. Furthermore, it was enchanted to keep the wielder focused and free from confusion.
The actual origin of Solemn Duty was a mystery. In 1281 DR, it was in the possession of the drow merchant Nym in Dorns Deep.
