A '''''wand of rotting''''' was a [[magic item]] that carried the vile power of the ''[[rising rot]]'' [[spell]].

==Powers==
The wielder of this wand could strike targets with a beam of brown energy that infected them with rotting mold. The mold would feed off of the target's nutrients and moisture, desiccating them from the inside out unless cured with a ''[[cure disease]]'' spell.

==History==
These items were associated with the priesthood of [[Moander]].
