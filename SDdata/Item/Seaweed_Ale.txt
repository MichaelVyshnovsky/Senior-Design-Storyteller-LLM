Seaweed Ale was an exotic variety of ale created by the dwarvish alesmith of Ravens Bluff named Bowser in the late 14 century DR.
Seaweed Ale was, not surprisingly, made from a bunch of seaweed, brought to Bowser along with stories of ale served at Sharkeys Bar & Grill. The resulting brew was mildly alcoholic, and its taste was to "die for" this was likely why the brewer himself did not dare to taste the concoction, blaming it on dwarves natural repulsion to water.
In the , Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast. The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking, Dark Maiden Wine, to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale, so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making, including Seaweed Ale.
