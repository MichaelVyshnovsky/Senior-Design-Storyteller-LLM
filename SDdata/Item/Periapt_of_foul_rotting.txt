A '''''periapt of foul rotting''''' was a deadly [[cursed]] item.

==Description==
A ''periapt of foul rotting'' resembled a small [[gem]] of little value.

==Powers==
Anyone claiming a ''periapt of foul rotting'' as their own would contract a terrible form of [[leprosy]], which would slowly degrade their nimbleness, health, and physical appearance; most people died within a couple of months, determined by which attribute was weakest.

There were few ways of countering it: by using both ''[[remove curse]]'' and ''[[cure disease]]'' in quick succession followed by a ''[[heal]]'', ''[[miracle]]'',

==History==
A number of ''periapts of foul rotting'' were recovered from the [[Imaskari]] city of [[Solon]], one of which was sent to Princess [[Tsenya Bhrokiti]] of [[Saikhoi]] as one of her bridal gifts in {{yearlink|1360}}.{{cite book/Storm Riders|62}} There were cups in the Solonese level of the excavations underneath Solon, which had the same effect if someone were to drink from them; they were available until {{yearlink|1360}} as well.

One was still hidden within the [[Temple of Set]] within the [[Oasis of the White Palm]] as of {{yearlink|1356}}.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|75}}
