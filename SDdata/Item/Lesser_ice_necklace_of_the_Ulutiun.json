        "mainbody": "Lesser ice necklaces of the Ulutiun were enchanted amulets, inspired by the Ulutiun tribes of the Great Glacier from the Northeast Faer√ªn.\nThese necklaces consisted of magically hardened and preserved ice crystals. Each ice necklace had four large transparent detachable crystals.\nEach of the four necklaces crystals were enchanted with powerful ice storm spell. When detached and thrown, the crystals exploded with the magics similar to those of the ice storm spell.\nLesser ice necklaces of the Ulutiun were created by a half-mad sorcerer who traveled among the members of the Ulutiun tribes of the Great Glacier. By the late 14 century DR, some of these magic necklaces reached the areas of the Sword Coast North and the lands of the Moonsea."
