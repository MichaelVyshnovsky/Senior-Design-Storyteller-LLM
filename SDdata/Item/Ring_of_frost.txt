A ring of frost was a magical ring capable of producing frost.
A ring of frost functioned like a wand of frost, though it had an unlimited number of charges.
Circa 1369 DR, Ascalan, a retired wizard and fishmonger of The Fish House in Wheloon, Cormyr, owned a ring of frost. He used it to refrigerate fish and create blocks of ice for sale.
