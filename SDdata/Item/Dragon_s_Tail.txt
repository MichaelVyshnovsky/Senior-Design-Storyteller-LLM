'''''Dragon's Tail''''' was a rare variety of [[enchanted]] [[shuriken]] created in a land to the east of [[Faer√ªn]].

{{quote|''As the tail of the [[Dragon]] sweeps across the sky, so too will these stars be unerring and true, if no other intent is meant or suffered.''|Poor translation of a single delicate symbol inscribed on every ''Dragon's Tail'' shuriken.}}

==Powers==
Each of these intricately cut sharp thrown disks was enhanced with a ''+2'' enchantment that, upon striking a target, burned the target with magic fire.

==History==
The creator of ''Dragon's Tail'' shurikens remained unknown in the west as even the inscribed symbol was poorly translated by the [[sage]]s and just as poorly comprehended. By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, some of these enchanted exotic thrown weapons had reached the [[Sword Coast]] and the city of [[Neverwinter]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Dragon's Tail'' were exported from the eastern realms and sold in [[Okuzo's Imports]] store in the [[Harbor Loop]] district of [[Westgate]].
