Horns were a type of wind musical instrument.
Several variants of horns existed, such as chordal horns, fanfare horns, hunting horns, and glaurs. Horns were typically made of brass, bronze, horn or shell.
The common horn, also known as a valveless trumpet, was traditional to kings courts.
Trumpets and other horns were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
* It was common for clerics of Eilistraee to be proficient with horns, as well as flutes and harps.
