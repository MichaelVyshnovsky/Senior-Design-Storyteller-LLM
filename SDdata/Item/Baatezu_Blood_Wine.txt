Baatezu Blood Wine was a type of dangerous alcoholic drink found in the Abyssal city of Samora, on the layer of Azzagrat.
Baatezu Blood Wine was a rare fiendish drink and hard to come by anywhere but Samora. The concoction was deadly to inhabitants of the Prime Material plane and for some lucky mortal imbibers â€“ just highly poisonous. Those rare individuals who survived drinking the Baatezu wine went into a roaring drunk stupor and eventually succumbed to being violently ill.
