        "Description": "This helm had a ''+2'' enchantment.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], the helmet was stashed amongst treasure in [[Orlumbor]]. Specifically, it was hidden in a temple of [[Talos]] to the south of the city-state, and was protected by those of the [[Kraken Society]], [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], and [[Zhentarim]]. However, the [[Heroes of Ascore]] slew them, and found vital intel, as well as the helm."
