        "mainbody": "n apparatus of Gond was a large, metallic vehicle developed in the late-15 century DR by master artificers of the Church of Gond as an homage to the famous apparatus of Kwalish.\nThese contraptions lacked the central porthole, dual periscope eyes, and rear exhaust-pipe that an apparatus of Kwalish exhibited. Instead they sported four small portholes in the front, which glowed with the interior light, and a rear extension resembling the tail of a giant lobster.\nthumb|273px|A refurbished apparatus of Gond.\nEmbellished These versions of the apparatus of Gond were burnished, sporting a shiny new finish, and etched with intricate designs. They also sported additional vents, meant to expose the magical blue glow illuminating the vessels interior.\nRed-Hued Nearly identical to the standard apparatus of Gond, except their bronze finish had been replaced with a bright red hue and silvery metal.\nSome Gondsmen were known to have created miniature, toy versions of these apparatuses."
