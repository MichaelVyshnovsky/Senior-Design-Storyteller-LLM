        "mainbody": "'''Treacle''', or '''molasses''', was a liquid, uncrystallized [[sugar]] syrup, sometimes eaten as a frozen treat.",
        "Description": "Treacle was a dark-colored opaque brown unrefined sugar syrup, as well as it's lighter-colored variation known as [[golden syrup]].{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|64}}",
        "Usages": "Treacle could be found in alchemy labs, food vendor stalls, taverns, and among items of some healers and physicians.\n\nTreacles was a common addition to [[oatmeal]], when [[maple syrup]] was not available. It was also used to prepare sweet treats such as [[nutbrown tart]]s and [[ginger biscuit]]s; [[bread]]s, like [[darkloaf]], as well as [[firefruit]] meat sauces and marinades; and sweet [[bean-barrel-sauce]] - as a type of edible preservative (however some preferred to wash the treacle sauce off before consuming). Lastly, treacle was sued in brewing and sweetening [[rum]]s and [[darkfire]] alcohols.\n\nAlcohol-soaked [[cherries]] were used in making molasses-base [[cherrybread]], popular in the [[Vilhon Reach]], the [[Border Kingdoms]], and the region of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], with it's fame reaching the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. Another pastry that used molasses was a pie-sized [[treacle tart]] found in the [[Chionthar Valley]].\n\n[[Rogue]]s sometimes used a thieves' tool called [[tar paper]]â€”a piece of thick and heavy paper, drenched in tar, [[honey]], or treacle. The paper was stuck on glass before being broken by a burglar. This simple tool reduced noise and contained all the glass shards in place.\n\nA single drop of treacle was used as a [[material component]] for the ''[[slow]]'' spell, prior to the [[Time of Troubles]]."
