        "mainbody": "'''''Intercession''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]], [[sentient item|intelligent]] [[longsword]] that granted the wielder added skill at deflecting incoming attacks.",
        "Description": "While the sturdy [[steel]] sword appeared rather mundane―with a simple blade, guard, and grip made of [[ogre]]-skin leather―it possessed significant power. ''Intercession'' possessed slight empathetic intelligence and was capable of guiding the movements of its wielder.",
        "Powers": "''Intercession'' struck more true and inflicted more harm than non-magical blades, in thanks to its ''+1 enchantment''. By means of the empathic bond it formed, the sword helped its wielder block and deflect incoming melee attacks.",
        "History": "The sword was crafted by [[Peth]], a [[wizard]] that lived in [[Elturel]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1272}}. Peth made the weapon specifically for an acquaintance of his, a [[ranger]] from [[Soubar]] named [[Kelhanion]].\n\nKelhanion was killed by over a dozen [[troll]]s when traveling through the [[Trollbark Forest]] some years later.\n\nSometime over the next decade, ''Intercession'' made its way north to the icy keep of [[Dragon's Eye]] in the [[Spine of the World]] mountains."
