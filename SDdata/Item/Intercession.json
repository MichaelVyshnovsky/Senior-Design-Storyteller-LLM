Intercession possessed slight empathetic intelligence and was capable of guiding the movements of its wielder.\nIntercession struck more true and inflicted more harm than non-magical blades, in thanks to its +1 enchantment. By means of the empathic bond it formed, the sword helped its wielder block and deflect incoming melee attacks.\nThe sword was crafted by Peth, a wizard that lived in Elturel as of the . Peth made the weapon specifically for an acquaintance of his, a ranger from Soubar named Kelhanion.\nKelhanion was killed by over a dozen trolls when traveling through the Trollbark Forest some years later.\nSometime over the next decade, Intercession made its way north to the icy keep of Dragons Eye in the Spine of the World mountains."
