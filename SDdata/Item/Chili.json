        "mainbody": "'''Chilis''' were hot [[pepper]]s used as strong [[spices]], that originated from the continent of [[Maztica]]. They were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.",
        "Description": "The strong flavor of chilis was unique, but was considered similar to [[Malatra]]n pepper. The spices were said to be able to cover up even the worst flavors, such as bad meat.\n\nWhen purchased through ''Aurora's'', chilis could be shipped either in whole dried pods or already ground. Chili powder was available in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]].",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the chili were considered a rare spice, and were very difficult to get (at least in [[Faer√ªn]]). Because of that their price had increased thrice."
