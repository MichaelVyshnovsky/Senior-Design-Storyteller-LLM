        "mainbody": "Chilis were hot peppers used as strong spices, that originated from the continent of Maztica. They were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nThe strong flavor of chilis was unique, but was considered similar to Malatran pepper. The spices were said to be able to cover up even the worst flavors, such as bad meat.\nWhen purchased through Auroras, chilis could be shipped either in whole dried pods or already ground. Chili powder was available in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep.\nBy the , the chili were considered a rare spice, and were very difficult to get (at least in Faer√ªn). Because of that their price had increased thrice."
