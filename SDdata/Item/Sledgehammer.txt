'''Sledgehammers''', or '''sledges''', were heavy, practical [[hammer]]s commonly used as tools in the [[Realms]].{{Cite dragon/288/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Moonwyvern Inn|74}}

==Description==
Sledges were large, heavy, well-balanced hammers.

==Usage==
Sledgehammers were widely used in construction and masonry.

Sledges were used with wedges to split wood. [[Cording mallet]]s were a one-piece version of a sledge and wedge that used an [[axe]]-like head for chopping wood.

Striker's sledges were used in blacksmithing for hammering metal during heavy forging.

Sledgehammers could be used as melee weapons, but they were too slow and cumbersome to be practical in anything but an emergency.

==History==
[[Ondeth Obarskyr]]'s iconic sledge was placed with his body on his funeral pyre in the {{YearlinkName|26}}. The scorched metal head of that sledgehammer was later kept in storage among other [[Cormyr]]ean treasures.
