        "mainbody": "The '''''torque of faith''''' was a [[magical item|magical]] [[Torque|neck ring]] holy to the church of [[Tymora]].",
        "History": "Around [[Kythorn]] of the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], the ''torque of faith'' was to be transported to [[The Lady's Favor]], a newly built temple of Tymora in the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] in [[the Vast]]. This was done in secret so as not to attract thieves. However, the [[Vipers]] bandits attacked the convoy anyway, massacred its guardians, and looted its wealth, including the torque. This was carried back to their hideout, the [[Vipers' Nest]], and stored along with the rest of their loot.\n\nThe Tymoran superiors at the [[Lady's Happy Hall|temple]] in the city of [[Procampur]] were outraged at the theft. They granted [[Randolph dul Umast]], high priest of The Lady's Favor, permission to recover the ''torque of faith'' at all costs. To this end, Randolph hired the ranger [[Dura Gerathu]] to locate the Vipers' Nest.\n\nWhen, on [[Eleint 1]], one of the hamlet's wells was poisoned, Randolph was guided by Tymora to link the poisoning to the Vipers. He sought adventurers to seek the [[poison]] ingredients or a cure, and return the ''torque of faith'' if they found it.",
        "Description": "At first glance, the ''torque of faith'' resembled nothing more than a plain and ordinary golden torque. However, closer examination revealed that it was fashioned entirely from gold coins of different sizes. They interlocked so closely that the torque appeared almost seamless.\n\nFor its [[gold]] content and craftsmanship alone, the ''torque of faith'' was valued at 700 [[gp]] on the open market. However, the church of Tymora considered it priceless.",
        "Powers": "The ''torque of faith'' possessed no magical [[aura]] that could be sensed with a [[spell]] of ''[[detect magic]]''. It also exhibited no powers or effects if worn by an ordinary person. It was only when worn by a priest of Tymora that it displayed its magic, and radiated a faint, golden glow that was barely visible in daylight.\n\nWhen worn, the torque enabled a priest of Tymora to use their luck powers as often as desired, and boosted such luck.\n\nThe powers of the torque were a closely guarded secret among the Tymoran priesthood."
