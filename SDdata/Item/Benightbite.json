        "mainbody": "'''Benightbite''' was a [[poison]] rumored to exist in [[Faer√ªn]] and described secondhand by the famed explorer and guidebook author [[Volothamp Geddarm]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew}}",
        "Description": "Benightbite was a shiny green, jelly-like substance that could be sweetened and used as a decoration or a filling in fancy desserts.",
        "Effects": "This poison was slow-acting, becoming fully effective over a course of hours after ingestion. A victim first experienced a numbing of the senses followed by fatigue and a slow decline into paralysis and sleep. Victims either recovered and woke up, or died in their sleep. Possible antidotes included cherries or cherry-based [[wine]]s and liqueurs."
