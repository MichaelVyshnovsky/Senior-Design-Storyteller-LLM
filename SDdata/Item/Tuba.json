        "mainbody": "The tuba was a type of bulky, brass wind instrument found in the Realms.\nThe mouthpiece of a tuba was a tiny, tapered cylinder. The instrument itself produced a distinctive deep sound.\nThe instrument was known to members of Clan Melairkyn, who kept a copy within the musical hall of their Dumathoin temple complex that later became known as the Lost Level of Undermountain.\nA mournful note from a tuba could be heard whenever a wand of conducting spontaneously crumbled into dust."
