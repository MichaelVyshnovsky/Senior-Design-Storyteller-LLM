Staves of the sea were magical staves that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These staves allowed a wizard to use the following powers cool strength, depth warning, converse with sea creatures, water blast, and waterbane. Using these powers expended one charge.
The following powers expended two charges for regular wizards and only one charge for sea mages conjure water elemental, ice storm, and command water spirits.
A sea mage wielding this staff could summon a maelstrom. Maelstrom consumed four charges.
Simply holding the staff granted the wielder the water breathing ability. This power did not consume a charge, but was only available as long as the staff had at least one charge remaining.
