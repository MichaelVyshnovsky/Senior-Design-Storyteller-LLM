        "mainbody": "Everbright was a quality that could be applied to metal armor The sun elves of Evermeet actually improved on the method, adding a blinding-flash ability to an everbright-treated weapon. Everbright items were incredibly shiny and incorruptibleâ€”immune to rust and corrosion. For an elvish-made blade, the wielder could cause it to flash an extremely bright light twice a day, possibly dazzling those nearby for a few seconds.\nTo craft an everbright weapon using the elvish technique, one had to have the spells blindness or deafness and searing light available. To make a shiny piece of armor only required a sufficiently advanced magical armorsmith.\nOnce a weapon was enhanced with everbright, its magics could be destroyed via forgefire, earthfire (lava) or dragonfire. This enchantment also made the weapons and armor safe from rust monsters.\n* The guardian god Helm wore +5 everbright full plate."
