        "mainbody": "The '''''Lion's Sword''''' was the [[Tethyr]]ian sword of state, wielded by princes and kings of the kingdom for centuries.",
        "Description": "The state sword of Tethyr had a hilt of [[gold]], carved into the shape of a [[lion]]. The body, rear legs and tail made up handle and pommel, with its forelegs and front paws forming the crossguard. The head of the lion had open jaws, with [[diamond]]-encrusted [[mithral]] teeth set into the groove of the blade, which extended from the gaping maw. Two [[rubies]] were inset within the lion's eyes.",
        "History": "The sword was originally forged for [[Alemander I|King Alemander I]] by a [[dwarven]] ally of his in the [[1122 DR|Year of the Rose Pearls, 1122 DR]]. The [[wizard]]-king further [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] the blade, transforming it into a ''[[Flame Tongue|flame tongue]]''. It was wielded by the monarchs and heirs of Tethyr until the [[1215 DR|Year of Starlight, 1215 DR]], when [[Coram IV|King Coram IV]] forged the ''[[Sword of Starlight]]'' for his son [[Haedrak II]].\n\nThe ''Lion's Sword'' was wielded by the [[Kymer|Shade King Kymer]],<ref group=\"note\">Page 27 of [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|''Lands of Intrigue: Erlkazar and Folk of Intrigue'']] refers to the Shade King as \"Kymerm\". the illegitimate son of [[Alemander II|King Alemander II]], before it was reclaimed by Haedrak II when he reclaimed the throne of Tethyr in the [[1227 DR|Year of the Wall, 1227 DR]].\n\nIt was believed to have been lost when [[Jaszur|King Jaszur]] was killed in [[Waterdeep]] in the [[1295 DR|Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR]],"
