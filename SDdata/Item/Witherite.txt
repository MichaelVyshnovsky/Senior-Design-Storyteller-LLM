'''Witherite''' was a yellow to white [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious]] gemstone.
==Description==
Witherite was found in large, fibrous deposits containing zones of translucent gem-quality material. If large enough, they yielded faceted pale yellow to whitish gems. Rarely, witherite occurred in clusters of translucent yellowish crystals which also yielded faceted gemstones. A typical specimen had a base value of 50gp.

==Powers==
Witherite gave some protection or even immunity to the withering effects of [[necromantic]] reversed healing spells and certain [[psionic]] attacks. The stone had to be mounted in a special [[electrum]] setting that allowed direct skin contact with the witherite. This was known to work for at least [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s.
