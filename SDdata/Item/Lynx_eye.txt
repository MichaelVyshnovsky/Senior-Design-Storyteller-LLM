Lynx eye was the Realms name for a variety of feldspar known as labradorite that exhibited a green flash.
These ornamental stones were pale to dark gray with large flakes of colored reflections. This "flash" could be of all shades, but only the green flash labradorite was called lynx eye on Toril. Lynx eye was usually cut cabochon, but it was brittle so most stones were less than 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.
Lynx eye stones could be dissolved in catoblepas tears or griffon blood to make a solution that could be the foundation of any healing potion or beneficial necromantic potion. This solution also could be substituted for a key ingredient of Keoghtoms ointment.
