        "mainbody": "The Hammer of Justice was the enchanted warhammer, wielded by a heroic cleric of Tyr from Myth Drannor, Bannoc.\nThe Hammer of Justice was a masterfully-crafter one-handed warhammer.\nThis hammer was a powerful magic item, imbued with a +1 enchantment that effectively became +3 when wielded against undead creatures. Additionally, the Hammer of Justice doubled the harm and punishment dispensed on the undead.\nThe Hammer of Justice was interred with its owner Bannoc in one of the crypts within the Elven Catacombs. In 1369 DR, the hammer was still inside its masters sarcophagus. The cleric of Tyr was cursed to haunt the place of his burial as a wraith, ready to attack any would-be grave robber to protect his magic hammer."
