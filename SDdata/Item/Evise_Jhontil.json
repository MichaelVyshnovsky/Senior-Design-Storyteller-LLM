        "mainbody": "The '''''Evise Jhontil''''' was an [[artifact]] of the clergy of [[Set]]. In the {{yearlinkName|976}}, it was moved to [[Lliiress]], where it was used by the [[blue dragon]] [[Gerinvioch]]\nto trap the entire population in a bubble where casting spells would kill its users.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|174-178}}",
        "Description": "The ''Evise Jhontil'' was shaped like a diamond, standing nearly four feet long and two wide. Its shape was octagonal. While operating in [[Lliiress]], it spun continuously, and blinking orange lights danced around it, faster the more magic that was used in its vicinity.",
        "Powers": "Anyone who attuned themselves to the ''Evise Jhontil'' by touching it would find that any spell subject to ''[[permanency]]'' would be made permanent, at grievous cost to their lifeforce. The caster was permanently bonded to his spells as well, making it impossible for them to be dispelled, including ''[[antimagic field]]'', ''[[mordenkainen's disjunction]]'' or even ''[[wish]]''. On the caster's death, the spell would cease.\n\nWhen [[Gerinvioch]] employed the device in [[Lliiress]] in {{yearlink|976}}, the dragon performed some ritual beforehand. The dragon was also able to employ the artifact right before then to create a barrier extending about a mile from the center of town, which prevented egress from the vicinity of the artifact{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|181}}\nAt the same time, it hid the area from just about all known means of discovery, including sight, hearing, and even most magic.\n\nThe effect of the artifact was slightly different on those within the barrier, subjecting anyone who employed a spell in its vicinity to a draining of their lifeforce that continued to power the spell repeatedly until it induced their deaths.\nThe effect somehow extended to most magic items, causing their destruction soon after activation. Even instant spells such as ''[[teleport]]'' instead forever blinked the caster between their location and their source every few moments.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|179-180}}",
        "History": "The artifact was said to be created by [[Set]] as an aid to his faithful in order to overthrow the ancient [[Imaskari]] While the text in ''Dragon'' reads Ilmakari, there is no Ilmakari civilization. Given that the Mulhorandi, where Set's pantheon is worshipped, were once enslaved by the Imaskari, and that the Mulhorandi pantheon actively destroyed them, this article proceeds under the assumption that Ilmakari was a spelling error and that the intended word is Imaskari. civilization.\n\nIn {{yearlink|976}},{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|169}} Aniolon Gruanthe sent several of his men to a ruin which contained a temple of [[Set]]. Less than a tenday later, they returned with the artifact; they related that the location, despite being uninhabited for about a half millenium, since the mid-to-late 5{{th}} century [[DR]], had enough traps to kill a half dozen of them, while an [[efreeti]] killed four more while they returned. Once given the artifact, the dragon created a barrier that would hide the town from anyone permanently.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|170-173}}\n\nHowever, the dragon's barrier also made it impossible to leave the area enveloped by the barrier\nwhile allowing entrance,\nand caused anyone who cast a spell inside the barrier to die as their lifeforce was constantly stolen to power the spells.\nA few people entered the location every so often, joining the permanent population, but as of {{yearlink|1372}}, no one had left.\nOn that year, a mage from [[Estagund]], [[Kinase Bronihim]], sought out Gerinvioch for the ''Evise Jhontil''. The dragon directed him towards [[Lliiress]],{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|183}}",
        "Reputation": "Gerinvioch demanded the ''Evise Jhontil'' of Aniolon Gruanthe in exchange for his protection in {{yearlink|976}}.\nIn {{yearlink|1372}}, the reputation of the Evise Jhontil was such that Kinase Bronihim sought the dragon for it.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|157-160}}",
