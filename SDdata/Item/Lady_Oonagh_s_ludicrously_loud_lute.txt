'''''Lady Oonagh's ludicrously loud lute''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[elf|elven]] [[lute]] that belonged to [[Lady Oonagh]] of the [[Forest of Tethir]].

==Powers==
The ''ludicrously loud lute'' produced intense sounds that rendered creatures that could hear it unable to function, suffering from pain and bleeding ears. Twice per day, the lute allowed the player to produce a crippling sound similar to the effects of the ''[[sound burst]]'' spell.

==History==
Lady Oonagh was born into a musically inclined elven family from the Forest of Tethir, but lacked any talent herself and in fact sang terribly. Thus, her traveling companion and lover, [[Lord Alex]], presented her with ''Lady Oonagh's ludicrously loud lute'' as a gag birthday gift. This enchanted musical instrument matched the Lady's wretched singing voice with its own cacophonous tune. Both sounded bad enough to make listeners' ears bleed.

By [[1372 DR]], the ''ludicrously loud lute'' could be found in one of the piles of "antiques" within the [[Torleth's Treasures]] store of [[Gillian's Hill]]. The lute appeared mundane, and its magic remained unidentified, mixed with other junk, sold for a mere one hundred [[gold]] pieces.
