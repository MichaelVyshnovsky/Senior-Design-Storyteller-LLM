It was a thick, almost chewy drink.\nThe first wave of popularity of Battledale Dark happened in the 13 century DR. However, the drink lost its demand in the century that followed. In the late 14 century DR, a resourceful merchant from Sembia started producing the stout once again, bringing it back to popularity."
