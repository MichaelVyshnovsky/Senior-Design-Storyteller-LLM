'''Felsul flower oil''' was an expensive [[perfume]] in the [[Realms]], derived from the [[felsul]] tree.{{Cite dragon/125/Woodlands of the Realms|14-16}}

==Description==
The oil was a fragrant, spicy perfume much sought after by wealthy ladies.

==Usages==
An ounce of the perfume provided about ten applications. The user benefited from the pleasant scent, as well as an extraordinary property of the oil that made them more persuasive to others for about ten minutes.

==Preparation==
The oil was derived from the yellow and purple flower petals produced by the [[felsul]] tree when (and if) it blossomed in spring. Depending on the harvest that year, a sack of petals could fetch as little as 5 [[sp]] or as much as 3 [[gp]]. The petals were then crushed and processed into the oil, with the average tree providing enough for up to {{SI|3|oz}} each year.
