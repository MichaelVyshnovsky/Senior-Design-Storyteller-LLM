'''''Cloaks of protection versus good''''' were [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s that aided their wearer against goodly creatures.

==Powers==
''Cloaks of protection versus good'' and their stronger version, ''greater Cloaks of protection versus good'' both gave the wearer enhanced protection of ''+2'' and ''+5'' enchantment respectively when facing goodly creatures.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''cloaks of protection versus good'' could be found in [[Neverwinter]], all across the [[Sword Coast North]] Many of these enchanted cloaks were commissioned by General [[Menthan Calcoler]] of the notorious [[Black Network]]. He planned on outfitting the entirety of [[Zhentarim]] army with these items but was assassinated by a [[Harper]] spy before he could roll the plan out. The deceased General's plan of marching into the [[Dalelands]] was not embraced by his successor and neither were these numerous cloaks paid for. The [[wizard]]s responsible for the items' creation ended up selling them to recoup their hefty financial losses.
