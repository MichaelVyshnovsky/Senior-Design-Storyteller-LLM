        "mainbody": "ladders were animal bladders that could be inflated to be enjoyed as childrens toys, employed as bardic props,\nWhile they could vary in size, the most popular bladders for entertainment purposes were from pigs, and could be inflated to the size of a human head. Bladders could be inflated with air or water. With air, they could be tied to a string, released to splutteringly fly around, or popped to produce a loud noise. With water, there was little more that could be done save for throwing them, although children could reliably devise more mischievous uses.\nBladders were useful for causing diversions or distractions.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, bladders were sold as bardic equipment from Auroras Emporium, where they cost 1 gold piece per five pig bladders. such as deep breath or steal breath."
