An '''amulet of supremacy''' was an extremely rare type of [[magic]]al [[amulet]] that was only worn by [[dragon]]s of [[Toril]]. It was immensely powerful piece of jewelry and was considered priceless among their species.

==Description==
A masterpiece of draconic craftsmanship, this amulet was made from the purest strains of metal and was adorned with flawless [[gem]]s that shone with the utmost brilliance. Craftmanship and material value combined was such that it was considered beyond pricing.

==Powers==
When worn, the amulet maximized the natural powers and [[spellcaster|spellcasting]] abilities of a dragon. It increased the destructive potential of the dragon's [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] and extended the duration, area of effect and damage of the spells they cast to their highest capabilities.

Any being other than a dragon who attempted to wear an ''amulet of supremacy'' died instantly, typically by immolation or ''[[disintegrate|disintegration]]'' after the amulet sapped the non-dragon of parts of his or her life force. The latter effect lasted even when the non-dragon survived killing effects.

==Creation==
Only the oldest dragons, who possessed the highest levels of [[arcane]] power were capable of crafting an ''amulet of supremacy''. As such, only a handful of them have appeared throughout the history of the Realms.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Tchazzar]]: The Father of Chessenta owned and habitually wore an ''amulet of supremacy''.
