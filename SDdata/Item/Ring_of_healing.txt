Rings of healing were magic items which could heal their wearers. They could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.
The rings were simple bands with a yellow gemstone.
A ring of healing did not heal continuously nor on command. Rather, in battle it would randomly but reliable release a burst of healing and restorative energy that closed wounds and cured ailments.
