        "mainbody": "Blade of Destruction was the enchanted greatsword that once belonged to one of the original Knights of Myth Drannor, Jelde Asturien.\nBlade of Destruction was a blue tinted heavy two-handed sword that shimmered with magic.\nBlade of Destruction had a +2 enchantment that also tripled the damage done with critical strikes.\nAt some point before 1369 DR, while exploring the ruins of Myth Drannor, Jelde Asturien found his way into the ancient tomb under the mansion of House Ammath in the Glim-Gardens district and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. In  1369 DR, the vault still contained Jeldes blade of destruction and a set of arcane mail."
