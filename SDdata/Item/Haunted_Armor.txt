The '''''Haunted Armor''''' was a suit of [[plate armor]] that was said to be haunted by [[ghost]]s of King [[Ulther]] and Prince [[Zherost]] who died wearing it long before [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
This armor had a [[gold]]en finish, making it appear expensive alluring. However, it was only plated with gold and not made entirely out of precious metal, indicating the frugality of the person who commissioned the ''Haunted Armor''.

This armor was also haunted - the fact that should dissuade anyone from buying it. Similar to houses with trapped restless spirits inside, this armor housed not one but two ghosts.

==History==
At one point long before [[1372 DR]], the not-yet ''Haunted Armor''  belonged to King Ulther. His nephew, Prince Zherost, craved the throne and decided to shorten the King's rule. Prince coated the insides of this gold armor with a potent contact [[poison]] the night before Ulther was to don the suit in a tournament. The plan was successful, and King Ulther died a day later. Even though his body was gone, his spirit somehow became trapped within the heavy plate. This fact remained unrevealed until Zherost donned the ''Haunted Armor'' for his coronation. The ceremony attendees noted that the new kind was getting increasingly agitated and constantly jerking to look over his shoulder and complaining of incessant whispers as the ceremony went on. Before the ceremony could conclude, Zherost dashed out of the castle, hollering in terror. As he fled, he tripped and plummeted into the castle's moat. The ''Haunted Armor'' weighted him to the bottom of the reservoir, and he quickly expired. It was believed that Prince Zherost's restless spirit joined that of King Ulther inside this plate mail.

Not many people were brave or stupid enough to try and wear the ''Haunted Armor'' and possibly joining its two residents. By 1372 DR, this armor was proudly displayed in [[Torleth's Treasures]], a curio store of [[Gillian's Hill]], propped up by the [[Castaway Gourd]] across from the store's main entrance.
