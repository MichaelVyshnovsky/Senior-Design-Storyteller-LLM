        "Availability": "* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold porcelain dolls, shaped solely like [[human]]s, that were made in the cities of [[Tilverton]] and [[Urmlaspyr]]. For a time the catalogue also sold dolls that had been made in [[Westgate]], until it received numerous complaints about the poor quality of Westhavian porcelain. Advertised as being perfect for the children of retired [[adventurer]]s, these dolls came in rich swaddling clothes and were sold for 2 [[gold piece]]s each.\n* The [[Toysmiths]], a toyshop in [[Ravens Bluff]] that was owned and operated by the gnome brothers [[Gunder Gaewilder|Gunder]] and [[Relvan Gaewilder]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|7}} sold porcelain baby dolls. They offered male ones for 2 gold pieces and female ones for 25 [[silver piece]]s. Customers were asked to specify what color they wished to have for the eyes and hair of their doll.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|23}}\n* [[Hezza]], a pawnbroker in [[Lyrabar]], carried porcelain dolls in his shop.{{cite book/The Rage|?|16}}",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Maniacal Manny]], an [[enchanter]] living in [[Procampur]], owned a menacing looking porcelain doll of a brown [[weasel]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Other Side of the Coin|16}}\n* Some male merchants in the Realms collected and traded porcelain dolls in secrecy, as they were liable to face ridicule by their acquaintances or outrage from their wives over how much they spent on such dolls. Some rented out private locales to get together for 'swap meets', such as at the [[House of Twilight]] in [[Tantras]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/05-17 - House of Twilight}}"
