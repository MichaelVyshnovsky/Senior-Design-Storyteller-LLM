        "mainbody": "Three Crabs was a signature dish from the Singing Sprite inn of Secomber in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe dish started with three soft-shelled green river crabs from the Delimbiyr River, with the mouth, eyes, and guts removed, then fried in fat until golden brown. A toasted loaf of round flatbread was topped with chopped greens and a white sauce of leeks, garlic, parsley, vinegar, and beaten egg yolks. The final dish was assembled by arraying the crabs facing each other atop the loaf.\nThree Crabs was a signature dish served at the Singing Sprite inn, alongside A Trio of Trumpets and the Hungry Knight. The dish sold for 7 gp, though this also included two tallglasses of mead, milk, or wine or tankards of ale, as well as plentiful hot buttered bread rolls and biscuits that could sate additional guests."
