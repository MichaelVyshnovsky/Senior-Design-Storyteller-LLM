        "mainbody": "'''Three Crabs''' was a signature dish from the [[Singing Sprite]] inn of [[Secomber]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The dish started with three soft-shelled green river [[crab]]s from the [[Delimbiyr River]], with the mouth, eyes, and guts removed, then fried in fat until golden brown. A toasted loaf of round [[flatbread]] was topped with chopped greens and a white sauce of [[leek]]s, [[garlic]], [[parsley]], [[vinegar]], and beaten [[egg]] yolks. The final dish was assembled by arraying the crabs facing each other atop the loaf.",
        "Availability": "Three Crabs was a signature dish served at the Singing Sprite inn, alongside [[A Trio of Trumpets]] and the [[Hungry Knight]]. The dish sold for 7 [[gp]], though this also included two tallglasses of [[mead]], [[milk]], or [[wine]] or [[tankard]]s of [[ale]], as well as plentiful hot [[butter]]ed [[bread]] rolls and [[biscuit]]s that could sate additional guests."
