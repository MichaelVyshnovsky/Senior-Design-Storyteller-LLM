        "mainbody": "Thunderbeast axes were enchanted throwing axes that were named after the often considered extinct creature, thunderbeast.\nThunderbeast axes were well-known for the loud sound of thunder that accompanied every hit done by these throwing weapons, the sound of thunder dealt sonic damage and often dazed and deafened the target. These axes also possessed a +3 enchantment.\nLegends spoke of these axes, claiming their origins to be a gift from the heavens. Many varieties of these axes existed in the world, making the theory one the single origin implausible. Most sages agreed that all the various thunderbeast axes were likely created in different places by different people in imitation or tribute to the long-lost original item."
