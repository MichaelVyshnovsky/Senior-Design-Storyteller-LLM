        "mainbody": "otions of climbing were magical potions that temporarily allowed the user to rapidly climb steep surfaces.\nThe liquid that composed a potion of climbing appeared to be separated into several layers of gray, silver, and brown colors that resembled bands of sedimentary rock. Agitating the liquid did not mix the layers.\nUpon drinking a potion of climbing, the user gained the power to climb as fast and as effortlessly as walking, for a duration of one hour. Even extremely difficult surfaces became considerably easier to climb while under the effect of the potion.\nIn the late 15 century DR, potions of climbing were sold at Corellons Crown, an herbalism shop in Trollskull Alley in the North Ward of Waterdeep, run by the wood elf Fala Lefaliir."
