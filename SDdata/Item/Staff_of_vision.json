        "Powers": "A ''staff of vision''  contained the ''[[darkvision]]'', ''[[Remove blindness or deafness|remove blindness]]'' and ''[[see invisibility]]'' spells, and two copies of the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell. Each time one of these was used, there was a chance that the caster would become mentally fatigued. It was worth around 43,000 gold pieces.",
        "Creation": "The creation process of a ''staff of vision'' was possible for someone skilled in staff-crafting. The spells needed for the creation included ''darkvision'', ''see invisibility'', ''remove blindness'', and ''true seeing''."
