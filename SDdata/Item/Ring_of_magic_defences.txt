Rings of magic defences were enchanted rings designed specially for use in wizards duels.
These simple-in-appearance rings were imbued with enchantments that improved the wearers spellcrafting skills, increased their resistance to magic, and allowed them to cast dispel magic once per day.
These rings were especially popular in cities among spellcasters who often entered into magical duels. Even the weakest wizard could stave off powerful spells, albeit for only a short period of time. By the late 14 century DR, these rings could be found in many huge settlements along the Sword Coast, including the city of Neverwinter.
