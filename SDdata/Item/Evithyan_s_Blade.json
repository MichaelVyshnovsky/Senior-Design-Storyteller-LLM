        "Description": "This [[elven]] sword was fashioned from well-balanced [[steel]], with a hilt of [[mithril]] beset with a small [[emerald]].\n\nThe sword could be duplicated through magical crafting using a ''[[Mordenkainen's sword]]'' spell.",
        "Powers": "This ''+3 longsword'' was especially potent against the drow: it worked like a ''+5 longsword'' against them, and could even drain the life force from them. It was so well known for slaying their kin that it often shook the resolve of any dark elves that saw it drawn in combat.",
        "History": "This blade was believed to be forged by, and named after, the supremely skilled, [[Evithyan|elven warrior-wizard]] of [[Myth Drannor]], some time during the 4{{th}} century [[DR]]. He wielded it in his battles against the [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]] and, before taking voyage to the isle of [[Evermeet]], passed it to his apprentice [[Calthalyon]]. Like his mentor, the young [[elf]] expertly bore the blade in great battles and passed it to another. This tradition continued for several centuries until one of these stewards of the sword unexpectedly died and ''Evithyan's Blade'' was lost for centuries.\n\nIt turned up, albeit very briefly, in the last years of the 13{{th}} century DR, in the possession of a novice [[thief]], before going missing once again."
