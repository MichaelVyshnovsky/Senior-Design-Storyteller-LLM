        "mainbody": "Stoutward was a unique enchanted buckler.\nThis shield possessed a +1 enchantment.\nSometime prior to 1281 DR, this shield was bestowed upon one Wurdar Stoutbrew by the then-leader of Clan Battlehammer for protecting his family from being killed and eaten by yetis. Wurdar would proceed to proudly wear the shield for the following ten years. Until one day, he sacrificed his life in battle against some orcs that hailed from the Spine of the World, allowing some key members of Clan Battlehammer to escape to safety.\nIn 1281 DR, this shield was found in the Kuldahar Pass to be in the possession of an orc named Uligar."
