        "History": "Sometime prior to [[1281 DR]], this shield was bestowed upon one [[Wurdar Stoutbrew]] by the then-leader of [[Clan Battlehammer]] for protecting his family from being killed and eaten by [[yeti]]s. Wurdar would proceed to proudly wear the shield for the following ten years. Until one day, he sacrificed his life in battle against some [[orc]]s that hailed from the [[Spine of the World]], allowing some key members of Clan Battlehammer to escape to safety.\n\nIn 1281 DR, this shield was found in the [[Kuldahar Pass]] to be in the possession of an orc named [[Uligar]]."
