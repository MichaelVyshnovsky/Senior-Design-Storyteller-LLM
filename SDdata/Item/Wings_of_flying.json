        "mainbody": "'''''Wings of flying''''' were wondrous [[magic item]]s bestowing the gift of flight on the wearer.",
        "Description": "These items usually resembled a plain black [[cloak]].",
        "Powers": "Once the command word was spoke, the cloak would sprout a pair of giant [[bat]] wings from their back. The wings had a {{SI|20|ft}} wingspan and allowed the wearer to fly with a maximum total weight of {{SI|500|lb|k}}. The wearer had to rest the wings after brief periods of either flying too quickly or performing too many aerial turns. Shortened periods of flight of ten minutes or less did not require the additional rest.\n\nThis item could be used once per day.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Barak al-Gani]], a priest of [[Shajar]] in [[east Zakhara]], owned a pair of  ''wings of flying''."
