A cursed berserking sword was a sword that bore a curse that sent its wielder into a bloodthirsty frenzy during the heat of battle.
Cursed berserking swords could come in the form of longswords, broadswords, short swords, bastard swords, or two-handed swords. Upon examination, the sword appeared to be a normal yet potent magic sword.
A cursed berserking sword bore a mighty enchantment that made it tempting to wield, however when the blade was drawn in battle, it affixed itself into the wielders hand and sent them into a blind battle rage. They were driven to fight and kill whatever creature or person was closest to them, only stopping once they themselves were slain or if nothing else was left alive within .
Even after this berserk state had passed, the curse rendered the wielder unable to relinquish the sword. A wielder could only be freed of the sword with the use of an exorcise, remove curse, or wish spell.
Cursed berserking swords could be found in both Faer√ªn and Zakhara.
It was rumored that the natural gem magic of diamonds could protect someone from the mind-influencing effects of a cursed berserking sword.
