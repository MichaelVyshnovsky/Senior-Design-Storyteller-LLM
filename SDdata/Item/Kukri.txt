A kukri was a type of heavy knife.
Kukris had a single-edged, heavy blade that curved forward.
Due to the curved design of a kukris blade, a wielder typically fought by slashing at their opponents. However, despite their design, a kukri was never intended to be used as a throwing weapon. They could be used like a dagger in most respects.
Beyond their use as weapons, kukri were rugged enough tools that they could be used to skin game or chop wood. Thus, they easily filled many of the same roles that a standard knife or handaxe would otherwise.
