'''''The Argyr''''', also known as the '''''Cube of Gond''''', was a tome sacred to the [[Gond|Gondar faith]].

==Description==
''The Argyr'' had the form of a cube, about 1' (0.3 m) on a side, crafted of [[adamantine]] and plated with [[electrum]]. Four of the cube's sides each bore six pull rings, each of which was attached to a thin coiled sheet of metal that unrolled from within the cube when pulled. All of these sheets, twenty-four in total, were engraved with different spells, some of which were found nowhere else outside the island-nation of [[Lantan]], where ''The Argyr'' was originally crafted.

==Function==
The pull rings could only be pulled successfully by one who first spoke the six secret names of [[Gond]] in the correct order. Any other attempt to tamper with the cube or access the cube's contents caused ''The Argyr'' to emit a ''[[chain lightning]]'' spell and teleport away in a random direction.

==History==
Word of ''The Argyr's'' existence first emerged sometime in the 9{{th}} century DR. Shortly thereafter, it was captured from a Gondar temple in [[Calimport]] by cultists of [[Bhaal]], led by the [[Tashalar|Tashlan]] cleric [[Othorgor]]. The cultists, having been previously unable to find a way to infiltrate the islands of Lantan and spread murder in that nation, decided to use ''The Argyr'' as bait. ''The Argyr'' was taken to [[Murder Hall]], an disused castle outside [[Tashluta]], and there successfully used to lure a number of Gondsmen to their deaths.

A [[Baldur's Gate|Baldurian]] adventuring party called the [[Griffons Away]] eventually managed to slay Othorgor, recover ''The Argyr'', and return the artifact to their citadel, [[Griffonsroost Hall]], but they too were eventually murdered by revenge-seeking Bhaalists. Their citadel was thoroughly looted and ''The Argyr'' lost for a time. Since then, the ''Cube of Gond'' resurfaced at least once, reportedly in the possession of the sage [[Maerltyl]] of [[Murann]], shortly before both he and his home were torn apart by [[gargoyle]]s who fled into the [[Forest of Tethir]].

In the midâ€“14th century DR, followers of Gond reported seeing visions of the cube appear above their altars during temple rituals, and at least one adventurer, [[Hadrar Bruynnis|Hadrar "Hawkblade" Bruynnis]], reported having briefly had possession of the cube in an underground complex beneath the [[Forest of Tethir]], before he was chased away by wights and other fell creatures.

==Contents==
The pages on the first side of ''The Argyr'' contained the spells ''[[command]]'', ''[[detect snares and pits]]'', ''[[find traps]]'', ''[[heat metal]]'', ''[[light]]'', and ''[[produce flame]]''; the second, ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[divine purpose]]'', ''[[locate object]]'', and ''[[warp wood]]''; the third, ''[[blade barrier]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', ''[[repair]]'', ''[[snare]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[water walk]]''; and the fourth, ''[[control temperature, 10' radius]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[protection from lightning]]'', ''[[regenerate]]'', ''[[understand device]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''.

According to one anonymous scroll, uncovered in [[Turmish]] by the sage [[Uthlan Abardreth|Uthlan "Wonderseeker" Abardreth]], patriarch of [[Gond]] in [[Chessenta]], pulling out all the pages at once and uttering the secret names of [[Gond]] another time would cause an additional rare spell, ''[[fist of Gond]]'', to appear on the device in illuminated letters.
