A '''''santur''''' ({{Pronounce|SAHN|toor}}) was a [[Zakhara]]n instrument similar to the hammered [[dulcimer]].{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

==Description==
The ''santur'' was similar in appearance to the ''[[qanun]]'', being a trapezoidal stringed instrument. Unlike the ''qanun'', the strings of the ''santur'' were single strings and not wound. They were made from metal and struck, not plucked, with special hammers.

==History==
The ''santur'' was a favored instrument of the [[Pearl Cities]] region of Zakhara. This fact alone made its use frowned upon within the [[Cities of the Pantheon|Pantheist League]].
