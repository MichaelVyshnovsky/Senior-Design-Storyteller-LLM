A santur () was a Zakharan instrument similar to the hammered dulcimer.
The santur was similar in appearance to the qanun, being a trapezoidal stringed instrument. Unlike the qanun, the strings of the santur were single strings and not wound. They were made from metal and struck, not plucked, with special hammers.
The santur was a favored instrument of the Pearl Cities region of Zakhara. This fact alone made its use frowned upon within the Pantheist League.
