        "Powers": "The ''rod of bone'' possessed two powers, emitting one from each end of the [[rod]]. The first projected death, instantly killing any living target struck by the blast. Victims killed in this manner would levitate for several minutes in unbreakable stasis after their death. The target needed to be within Kelemvor's line of sight for this to function. The second power overwhelmed up to 80 different targets within a cube measuring {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} on each side. The death sleep caused victims to succumb to a coma in which their entire body ceased to function for one full day."
