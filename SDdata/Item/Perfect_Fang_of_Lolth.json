        "mainbody": "he Perfect Fang of Lolth was a unique enchanted scythe, part of a set alongside the Perfect Charm of Lolth, forged deep in the Demonweb Pits, the Abyssal layer ruled by Lolth, The Demon Queen of Spiders.\nThe Perfect Fang was an ornate weapon, carved with ancient magical runes of the Demonweb Pits.\nThis powerful Lolthite scythe was built to rip into the souls of the enemies of the Spider Queen. The weapons powers increased when it was wielded alongside the Perfect Charm of Lolth. In addition to dramatically increased damage health by the scythe, it healed the wielder with each successful slash. The Perfect Fang also magically shielded its wielder from incoming damage when their stamina was exhausted during battle. Lastly, at the beginning of each battle, the scythe increased the wielders chance of dealing increased damage with a lucky or well-aimed attack.\nThe weapons magic made it usable by barbarians only.\nThe Perfect Fang of Lolth and the Perfect Charm of Lolth were forged in eons past deep in the Demonweb Pits. The weapons found their way to the Prime Material plane in the late 15 century DR, possibly ending up in the hands of drow and adventurers of the Northdark who challenged the beholder deity Gzemnid, or barbarians who survived a descent into the Demonweb Pits and a battle with Lolth herself."
