A torque () was a style of jewelry worn about the neck.
Unlike a necklace, a torque was crafted as a single piece, which was attached around the wearers neck by bending the metal.
Torques could be made from a variety of materials. A simple copper torque might sell for 5 silver pieces, but the addition of gemstones or extra details in the design would raise the price higher. The base prices for silver, gold, or platinum torques in most economies were 5, 50, and 500 gold pieces, respectively. Auroras Emporium sold silver torques in style of the Moonshae Isles for 50 gold pieces. These were crafted with two rams heads, each with emerald eyes.
