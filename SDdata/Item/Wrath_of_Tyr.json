        "mainbody": "The '''''Wrath of Tyr''''', also known by its original name '''''Tersyus''''', was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[warhammer]] and the sibling weapon of the ''[[Mercy of Tyr]]'' and the ''[[Wisdom of Tyr]]''.",
        "Powers": "''Tersyus's'' enchantments only allowed creatures who served the forces of good to wield this magic hammer. It possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and channeled radiant divine energy into its strikes.",
        "History": "''Tersyus'', along with its two more powerful siblings hammers, ''Bythialarus'' (''Wisdom of Tyr'') and ''Ulhaeron'' (''Mercy of Tyr''), were forged in {{Yearlink|750}} to celebrate the crowning of the [[Valjevo]] dynasty in [[Phlan]] of the [[Moonsea]]. Many centuries later and after the fall of Phlan, these three hammers were unearthed by the [[Waterdeep]]'s branch of the [[Church of Tyr]]. The Tyrran [[cleric]]s awarded these hammers to the allies of the church who fought to defeat Tyr's enemies.\n\nSometime before [[1374 DR]], ''Tersyus'' was gifted to [[Charissa Maernos]], a young [[paladin]] of Tyr and a member of the [[Maernos]] noble family of Waterdeep. The [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] was impressed with the young woman's triumph over a coven of malicious [[Malar]]ite [[druid]]s who were spreading pestilence in the [[Ardeep Forest]]. However it was unknown if this story was true.\n\nIn 1374 DR, Charissa Maernos wielded the ''Wrath of Tyr'' during her pursuit of vengeance agains the [[Night Masks]] of [[Westgate]] who were responsible for her family's downfall."
