        "mainbody": "'''''Grogbeard's Grimace''''' was an enchanted [[rapier]] that belonged to the renowned [[Grogbeard]] the Privateer from the [[Nelanther Isles]] off the coast of the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Powers": "''Grogbeard's Grimace'' was enchanted to protect its wielder against spells, increasing their resistance to ''[[arcane]]'', ''[[divine]]'', and spell-like creature abilities.",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1372 DR]], Grogbeard the Privateer wielded the enchanted rapier that later became known as ''Grogbeard's Grimace''. The pirate was renowned post-mortem for his swashbuckling skills and the circumstances of his death. Grogbeard received a deadly wound after drinking heavily, dueling, and swinging from a ship's mizzenmast. His wound festered, becoming infected, eventually ending his privateering career.\n\nFollowing Grogbeard the Privateer's death, the ''Grimace'' remained in the Nelanther Isles, changing hands several times over the years."
