        "mainbody": "Oil of great devotion was a magical substance that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThe vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider and the bottom than they were at the top.\nIf a priest of low to middle ranking used this oil, it temporarily granted them a higher understanding of their clerical power. This did not grant additional spells, but it did increase the effectiveness of other abilities such as turning or commanding undead.\nOil of great devotion was only usable by priests.\nCategoryMagical substances\nCategoryOils\nCategoryItems from Zakhara\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nCategory2000-2999 gold pieces\ncr80p357acoqfs6134db0e8a6io9grh"
