}}A '''''tel'kiira''''',,) was a powerful and dangerous '''lore gem''' worn by the leaders of the elven Houses, with their color and clarity acting as a status symbol among the Houses.

While properly called ''tel'kiira'', the name was often shortened to simply ''kiira'', but a true ''tel'kiira'' was much more powerful than the lesser ''[[kiira]]'' in circulation by the time of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Creation==
The first ''tel'kiira'' was rumored to have been created by the enchanters of the Uvaeren settlement in [[Cormanthyr]]. One way ''tel'kiira'' were created was by an uncommon [[Elven high magic|High Magic]] ritual known as "''lalyshae'Seldar'Wihylos''" ("Sacraments of Seldarine Blessing") that also required a clerical ritual to accompany it. The priests prayed to draw the gods' attention and power, while three to four [[Elven high mage|High Mages]] bound the power to an object to create large amounts of the iconic items of the elven race. In the case of ''tel'kiira'', the god invoked is usually [[Sehanine Moonbow]] (as the goddess of omens and mysteries), however [[Corellon Larethian]] or [[Labelas Enoreth]] could also be called upon to bless the endeavor.

==Description==
''Tel'kiira'' were not limited to a specific type of [[gem]], Regardless of type, they were never larger than the nail on an elvish pinky finger. They tended to be polished smooth with a slight mound shape, without any facets. The original color of the gem became accented and deepened with each new mind-meld. A number of Elder Houses had gems that were nearly black in hue, depicting the vast amount of knowledge the gem contained.

Typically a kiira was attached to the forehead where it formed a mental link to its user. Certain kiira could be easily removed, while some bearers could will the stone to become invisible while worn. 

==Powers==
Unlike the case for other kinds of ''kiira'', [[Elf|elven]] lore gems could only be worn by [[elves]]. This knowledge could be accessed by future wearers of the gem. Usually, one merely needed to touch the stone to reveal its contents, but it was also possible to guard the contents against casual access.

Some elven [[wizard]]s used these stones as spellbooks.

Only elves of high intelligence could wear these gems. If these requirements were not met, the violator could become [[Feeblemind|feebleminded]]. Even those who met the requirements and wore the gem of their own House did not find it easily controlled. Lore accessible via the gem was not immediately available to a wearer after surviving the transfer.

==Variations==
Simpler versions of ''kiira'' were also possible to create, which non-elves could use. In addition, there were also two other kinds of ''kiira'' known to exist:
; ''[[Kiira N'Vaelahr]]'' : These 24 gems were used by the undercover agents of the [[N'Vaelahr]] before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]]. They stored memories and magic like a regular ''kiira'', but also facilitated mental communication.
; ''[[Selu'kiira]]'' : A ''selu'kiira'' was also known as a "High Lore Gem". One would have been made from a rainbow [[tourmaline]], and was typically a larger, more ornate and faceted sparkling crystal than a normal ''kiira''. A ''selu'kiira'' changed color over time depending on how many memories it had absorbed. Colors changed from hues of blue to green, to black, to brown, to orange, and finally to a bright red hue after more than 3000 years of age. The main difference between a ''tel'kiira'' and a ''selu'kiira'' was that a ''selu'kiira'' could also store the knowledge of [[Elven High Magic]]. Use of one was also not limited to elves, but it took someone of very high mental fortitude to access the knowledge contained within the gem.

==History==
While at one time all noble houses of [[Cormanthor]] owned a ''kiira'', it was known that the following elven Houses owned a ''kiira'': [[Alastrarra]], [[Aunglor]], [[Durothil]], [[Haevault]], [[Iliathor]], [[Neirdre]], [[Nimesin]], [[Orbryn]], [[Raedrimn]], [[Starym]], and [[Ulondarr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

The [[Hall of Living Memory]] deep in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] had walls embedded with ''tel'kiira'', which stored a wealth of history, including the location of the [[Wyrmskull Throne]].

The Alastrarra House's ''tel'kiira'' was returned to them in [[Cormanthor]] by [[Elminster]] in [[241 DR]].

In [[326 DR]], The mercenary mage [[Ansel Burwyth]], known as the "Master of Gems", had possession of a ''kiira'' from an unknown elven House. With it, he entrapped the soul of the "Ruling Magister" of [[Tashalar]], [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]]. The gem was then hidden and never found, though some believed that it was part of a collection of magic jewels hidden within the [[Dragon Reach]].

In [[1368 DR]] the ''kiira'' of the long dead house of [[Hadryad]] fell into the hands of a human [[wizard]], [[Oth Eltorchul]]. He used the [[Mhaorkiira]], or "dark gem", to create the items known as ''[[dream sphere|dream spheres]]''. Later that same year the power of the ''kiira'' was destroyed by [[Danilo Thann]] and the ruby was set into a ring and given to his mother, Lady [[Cassandra Thann]].
