        "Description": "Only certain types of swords could be enchanted to become ''swords of sharpness''; namely, those that slashed their targets rather than pierce them.",
        "Powers": "Whenever a blow from a ''sword of sharpness'' connected with an object, it always dealt the maximum possible damage. Particularly precise hits not only dealt even more damage but also incurred a chance of severing a limb or part of the target's body.\n\nIn addition, the sword accepted a command word to start shining, illuminating a radius of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. This property was deactivated once the command word was spoken again or if the sword was sheathed.",
        "Notable ''Swords of Sharpness''": "* [[Tearulai]], a sentient ''sword of sharpness''. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} it was embedded in the skull of the [[green dragon]] [[Valdemar]], who inhabited the [[Wyllowwood]] level of [[Undermountain]].",
