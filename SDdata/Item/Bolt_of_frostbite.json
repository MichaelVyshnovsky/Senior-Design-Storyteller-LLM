        "mainbody": "olts of frostbite were a type of enchanted crossbow ammunition.\nThese magic bolts were colt to the touch. Each shaft was imprinted with a short message \"Warning A Touch of Frost.\" Upon contact with their targets, bolts of frostbite dealt a freezing cold damage, additional to piercing. A stronger variation of these bolts was imbued with a +1 enchantment and transformed into a rolling ball of ice that numbered and freeze-burned their targets.\nBy the late 14 century DR, bolts of frostbite were often used along the Sword Coast region, as well as the Moonsea."
