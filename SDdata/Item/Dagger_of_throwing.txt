A '''''dagger of throwing''''' was a sturdy, perfectly balanced [[dagger]] that radiated [[magic]] and carried an enchantment ranging from ''+1'' to ''+4''.

==Powers==
It could be thrown up to {{SI|180|ft|long=yes}}, and on a successful hit, hurt its target twice as much as an ordinary dagger, as well as striking them with magical energy.<ref group="note">This property was distinct from typical magic weapons in that the bonus was not applied to the attack roll.
