'''Blood Altars''' were important unholy items found within shrines and temples dedicated to [[Garagos]]. 

==Description==
Blood Altars were made from stone. They were surrounded with troughs used to collect blood.

==History==
The faithful of Garagos used Blood Altars to commune with their dark lord. A supplicant would approach a Blood Altar, cut themselves, and drip a few drops of their blood into the troughs around the altar. The blood of a sacrifice was also acceptable. Once the blood was spilled the supplicant prayed to the Reaver and promised to perform an act of carnage in return for an answer to their prayer.
