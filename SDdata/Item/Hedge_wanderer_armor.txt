'''''Hedge wanderer armor''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[armor]] made of cured [[goat]] hide, created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This [[hide armor]] possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment and slightly boosted the wearer's dexterity and reaction. Additionally, the wearer received a minor improvement in their knowledge of nature.

==History==
Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a simple goat herder aided a [[druid]] in investigating a strange hedge maze. Thankful for the help, she used her nature magic to ''[[bless]]'' all of the shepherd's goats and placed a protective enchantment on his simple goat-hide garb. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''hedge wanderer armor'' was owned by [[Arron]], a [[hin]] druid trader from the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
