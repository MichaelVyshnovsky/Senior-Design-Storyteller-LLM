        "mainbody": "The '''well of many worlds''' was a legendary, wondrous item that had an effect similar to the [[spell]] ''[[gate]]''.",
        "Description": "The ''well of many worlds'' was similar in appearance to a ''[[portable hole]]''. It was a fine black cloth, with a softness similar to silk, typically folded up like a handkerchief. When unfolded it had a circular shape, {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in diameter.",
        "Powers": "By unfolding this object upon a solid surface, one could open a two-way [[portal]] to another planet or [[plane of existence]]. The planet or plane that a ''well of many worlds'' opened to was different each time it was used. Its portal could be closed by taking hold of the cloth's edges and folding it up. After use, one had to wait one to eight hours before they could open another portal.\n\nNotably, this object would not function when within the [[Demiplane of Dread]], though while there it continued to radiate strong detectable magic.",
        "History": "Some time in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[Mulmaster]] [[wizard]] possessing one of these was on the ship ''[[Moonwind]]'' when it was sunk by a storm {{SI|50|miles|k|long=yes}} off the coast of its destination, [[Ravens Bluff]]. During the confusion, this ''well of many worlds'' fell out of the wizard's [[robe]] and unfolded upon the ship, opening a portal to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] that water proceeded to flood into. In the days that followed, the water level of [[Dragon Reach]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] dropped by an inch each day as the ocean continued to flood into the ''well of many worlds''.{{Cite polyhedron/77/Downunder the Living City|9-10}} Much of it poured into the [[City of Brass]].{{Cite polyhedron/77/Downunder the Living City|13}} After four days, [[Rolf Sunriver]] assembled a group of [[adventurer]]s to investigate this and had them equipped with supplies by [[Calvin Longbottle]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Gantar Kraok]]'s [[deepspawn]] ally, who laired within the ruins of a temple next to his [[Hall of Living Memory]], had a ''well of many worlds'' as part of its treasure horde.\n* [[Maddgoth]], the mad serial killer of wizards, had one that he kept within his [[Maddgoth's Castle|level]] of [[Undermountain]].\n* [[Zinnabar Albbee]], the [[wildspace]] traveling wizard.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|737|Zinnabar Albbee}}",
        "Trivia": "* When used inside the legendary hut of [[Baba Yaga]], the ''well of many worlds'' would not function normally&mdash;opening a portal to somewhere else within the hut instead of another plane or planet.{{Cite dragon/83/The Dancing Hut|37}}"
