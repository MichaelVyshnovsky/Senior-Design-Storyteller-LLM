        "mainbody": "A '''rissik''' was a mobile structure used by [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''iskotuk'']] of the [[Ulutiun]]s.",
        "Description": "A rissik was a unique tent structure composed of four to eight ribs measuring {{SIrange|3|5|ft|long=yes}} in length. These ribs were secured together with leather cords, forming the framework of the tent. The rissik was designed to open like an umbrella, with its ribs embedded into the ground, creating a dome-shaped tent with a flat roof. When not in use, the rissik was collapsed into a compact bundle. Despite its size, a bundled rissik was lightweight and was easily carried by an adult [[caribou]], with several [[tent]]s in tow.\n\nThe ribs of the rissik were constructed from thin and flexible pieces of wood or bone. To provide shelter, the tent was covered with two layers of caribou skin. The skins were arranged in such a way that the furry sides touched each other, creating an enclosed pocket of air. This air pocket served as insulation, trapping warmth within the tent. The skins were stretched tightly over the ribs to ensure that the air pocket remained open and effective in providing insulation.\n\nThe interior of a rissik was not as warm as a [[snowhouse]]. However, properly constructed rissik could still be up to 30 °F (17 °C) warmer within than outside.",
        "Construction": "The first step in erecting a rissik was selecting an appropriate site. The optimal sites for setting up the rissik were within forested areas or on thick ice. These locations offered the advantage of reduced snow drifting issues compared to other areas. The presence of trees or solid ice helped mitigate the risk of snow accumulation and provided a more secure and stable environment for the rissik.\n\nThe most unfavorable locations were those found in areas covered with freshly fallen snow or near hills and mountains. In such places, the rissik was susceptible to snow drifting from banks or being blown off the slopes, leading to its complete burial overnight. In the best-case scenario, the camper would need to spend their morning digging themselves out of the snow, but in the worst-case scenario, there was a risk of suffocation.\n\nThe second step was to dig the holes for the ribs. The holes should have a depth of approximately {{SIrange|4|6|in|long=yes}} and be slightly wider than the diameter of a rib. Typically, a knife or [[Ulutiun dictionary#H|''hukek'']] was sufficient for digging these holes. However, if the ground proved to be particularly hard, the tool might need to be heated beforehand. Some [[Angulutiun]]s carried a specialized tool called a [[Ulutiun dictionary#T|''tihukek'']], which was a hollow bone placed upright on the ground at the desired location for the rib hole. The camper then poured a small amount of boiling water into the ''tihukek'', causing the ground to thaw and facilitating easier digging.\n\nThe third step was to secure the ribs. The rissik was carefully unfolded and the ribs inserted into their respective holes. The covering was smoothed to ensure a taut fit. The holes were then packed with snow and water poured over the packed snow. Once the water froze, the ribs were secured in place.\n\nThe fourth step was the construction of a windbreak. When camping in open plains, it was essential to protect against potential burial by drifts, especially during snowfall at night. To mitigate this risk, a windbreak was built approximately {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} from the rissik, facing the direction of the wind. The windbreak was often built of snow and ice and was about {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} tall forming a half-circle. The windbreak was strengthened by pouring water over it, which quickly froze.\n\nThe fifth step was to ensure the roof was secure. A separate section of skin, known as a [[Ulutiun dictionary#s|''sarissik'']], functioned as the roof of the rissik. The sarissik was attached to the top edge of the rissik using [[leather]] cord, leaving a small opening for ventilation.\n\nThe sixth step was to construct a bed platform. The bed platform in a rissik, made of ice blocks and covered with skins, was identical to that found in snowhouses. In the absence of ice blocks, snow or branches served as alternatives.\n\nThe final step was to illuminate the interior using a small [[lamp]] or a [[cooking pot]] filled with [[blubber]]. The fire was covered with an [[uliririssik]] to protect the walls of the rissik."
