A '''snuff box''' was a container used to store [[snuff]] for its owner.

==Description==
A typical snuff box held about {{SI|1|ounce|long=yes}} of snuff powder or another similar fine material, and was small enough to be easily carried about. They could be made from any number of materials, from the durable to the decorative.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' supplied mail-order snuff boxes with [[Calishite]] designs, built from [[hardwood]], [[steel]], [[silver]], or [[gold]].
