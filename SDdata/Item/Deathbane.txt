Deathbane was a sacred enchanted staff of powerful healing magic that belonged to a blind moon elf cleric of Mystra named Beriand circa 1369 DR.
Deathbane was a beautiful ornate staff laced with intricate runes written by a delicate elven hand. The staffs name Deathbane was written on it in the same graceful manner. The staff felt warm to the touch.
Deathbane did not possess any offensive powers it was a healers tool. The user of Deathbane could cast an extremely powerful version of the heal spell.
In 1369 DR, Deathbane was in Beriands possession when he ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor, along with many other adventurers, following Elminsters call for aid against the Cult of the Dragon that planned to use the ruins mythals and the Pools of Radiance to conquer the region. Beriands group was ambushed by orcs and though he was dragged to safety by Faeril, the Deathbane staff was lost to the attackers.
Beriand requested aid from another group of adventurers from Phlan that arrived late to the scene. They managed to recover the staff from the Dwarven Dungeons under Myth Drannor and return it to the blind cleric.
