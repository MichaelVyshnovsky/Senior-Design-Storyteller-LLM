        "mainbody": "'''''Boris''''' was a powerful and sentient magical [[rapier]] owned by an adventuring pirate [[bard]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "''Boris'' was a graceful thin rapier with a hilt and guard crafted in a perfect likeness of [[Boris]], the pirate captain who raised [[Calliope]] and was her mentor and father figure. Calliope kept the relation between her uncanny sentient weapon and her mentor a secret.",
        "Powers": "''Boris'' possessed sentience and the voice of the pirate captain. Another enchantment that was placed on ''Boris'' allowed the rapier to deal ranged psychic attacks. Upon a successful strike, in melee or at a distance, the rapier could project deadly ''[[psychic scream]]'' that wounded the target's psyche and continued echoing in their minds, dealing additional psychic damage for the next several minutes.",
