'''''Boots of the sahuagin''''' were [[enchanted]] [[boots]] worn by sailors and pirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]] and the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Powers==
Despite their name, ''boots of the sahuagin'' were not crafted by [[sahuagin]] and were very obviously manmade. These boots were well-made and sewn out of water-resisting material that made them quite popular among fishers and sailors. The minor enchantment that was placed on these boots increased the wearer's fortitude.

==History==
These sailors' boots were in common use in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Captain [[Allendry]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' outfitted his crew and offered the boots for sale.
