Kluusars chain of warding was the unique enchanted amulet that once belonged to Kluusar, an inhabitant of Myth Drannor, buried in the Dwarven Dungeons.
This amulet was a necklace decorated with three magic symbols.
Kluusars chain of warding possessed several useful magical properties. It possessed a +1 enchantment to defense, increased the wearers fortitude, and increased their resistance to magic. Additionally, this chain held six charges of the lesser globe of invulnerability.
In 1369 DR, Kluusars chain of warding could be found far away from its masters tomb in the Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor. This magic necklace was discovered by a dark naga who laired in the Elven Catacombs First Cellars, within an ancient library. The naga hoarded treasures and had the booty guarded by enslaved orogs.
