When thrown, it buzzed like a wasp with its scales standing up from its surface, making it spin. The javelin always homed in on its target.\nWith the command words \"I call on ggatzshriiegk\" said out loud or in ones mind, the magical javelin could be summoned into the hands of its owner. The summoning could be done across the room or across the planes with equal ease. The damage done with the javelin was magical, piercing stone and flesh with ease.\nGgatzshriiegk was a part of a battle between vrocks led by Shaakat, and the rescue party of paladins led by Aleena Paladinstar, circa 1371 DR. During the combat, the magical javelin easily pierced and killed two barlguras and a simulacrum of Aleena herself in one throw. Eventually, the javelin was broken by one of the paladins and was buried under a collapsed tunnel along with the pyramid and the portal where the battle took place.\n*Shaakat was a vrock who owned ggatzshriiegk circa 1377 DR."
