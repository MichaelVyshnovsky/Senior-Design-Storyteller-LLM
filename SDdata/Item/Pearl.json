        "mainbody": "'''Pearls''' were not mined, they were the product of [[oyster]]s or other mollusks, but they were treated like gemstones.",
        "Description": "Pearls were formed of layers of [[tchazar]] ([[wikipedia:en:aragonite|aragonite]]) around a bit of grit or other irritant, growing inside a mollusk over the span of a few years. This slow process gave pearls a smooth surface with a deep, rich luster.\n\nOver-sized pearls {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} were frequently flawed in some way and not as valuable. One exception to this was a perfect head-sized pearl that was enchanted to become a ''[[crystal ball]]''. depending on market value.",
        "Currency": "Certain underwater races used pearls as currency rather than coins. The value of this currency changed according to several factors: the size of the pearl, measured from a standard of {{SI|0.25|in|m|long=yes}}; its rarity; and quality. In the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], the value of a pearl was determined primarily by its color:\n\n* white pearl, or \"seyar\": 1 cp undersea and 2 sp ashore;\n* yellow pearl, or \"hayar\": 1 sp undersea and 2 gp ashore;\n* green pearl, or \"tayar\": 1 gp undersea and 20 gp on land;\n* blue pearl, or \"nuyar\": 5 gp undersea and 100 gp on land;\n* olive pearl, or \"olmar\", {{SI|7|in|c|long=yes}} long, {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} wide, and diamond-shaped: 500 gp undersea and over 2,000 gp ashore.",
        "Notable Users of Pearls": {
            "Magic": "* Pearls were used as a [[material component]] in many [[spell]]s, particularly those that reduced acids to plain water, and ''[[neutralize poison]]''. Crushed to a powder, pearls were used in creating all types of magic mirrors. Well-known magical items included the ''[[pearl of power]]'', the ''[[pearl of the sirines]]'' and the ''[[pearl of wisdom]]''.\n*  Pearls were used to create ''[[periapt of wisdom|periapts of wisdom]]'', common magical amulets often found in possession of high-ranking clergy.",
            "Races & Sentient Creatures": "* Pearl was a common stone among the [[drow]], a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit they used only those of black, red, or deep mauve colors.\n* The [[shalarin]] of [[Ser√¥s]] were known to craft [[pearl armor]] by transforming entire pieces of clothing into pearl using [[giant clam]]s.",
            "Religions": "* Pearls were considered sacred by followers of [[Deep Sashelas]] and [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}\n* White pearls were sacred to followers of [[Savras]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|13}}\n* Black pearls were sacred to followers of [[Shargaas]]{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|14}} and [[Vhaeraun]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}}\n* The temple complexes of [[Blibdoolpoolp]] typically had large black pearls in them. Changes in their coloration were seen as favorable omens."
