        "Powers": "These belts were ensorcelled to protect their wearers from any types of ''[[death magic]]'' and [[disease]]s, and improved their fortitude.",
        "History": "A long time before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a long-forgotten [[druid]] conclave infected Uthgardt [[barbarian]]s with a virulent [[pox]] in order to control the tribes. The sickness spread out of control and threatened complete Uthgardt extinction. To heroically resolve the problem the druids themselves created, the conclave crafted numerous ''ceremonial Uthgardt belts'' and dispersed them among barbarian leaders. Thanks to the belts, Uthgardt tribes survived; however, this only made their distrust of outsiders more extreme.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''ceremonial Uthgardt belts'' could be found in several locations across the [[Sword Coast North]], including [[Beorunna's Well]], and the city of [[Hillsfar]] of the [[Moonsea]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Gorgotha]], a dragon who resided in the [[Spine of the World]] and held grave animosity towards [[Klauth]], a [[red dragon]], ''circa'' 1372 DR.\n* [[Yusam]] of Beorunna's Well, had one of these belts in his inventory ''circa'' 1372 DR."
