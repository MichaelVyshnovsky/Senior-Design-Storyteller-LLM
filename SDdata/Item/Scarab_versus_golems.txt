A '''''scarab versus golems''''', known as a '''''golembane scarab''''' by {{yearlink|1372}}, was a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] pin that was designed to help combat [[golem]]s.

==Description==
This pin was in the shape of a [[scarab]].

==Powers==
These pins bestowed two powers upon their wearer. The first was the ability to detect any form of golem within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the wearer, though they had to concentrate. Their second power enabled a wearer to harm golems with any form of weapon, overcoming their immunity to non-magical weapons.

When it came to the second power, there were different types of pins that could affect golems. Most affected only a single type of golem. The second most expensive affected [[flesh golem]]s, [[clay golem]]s, and [[wood golem]]s. And the most expensive type affected all forms of golem.

These scarabs could be to form ''[[anvil of darkness|anvils of darkness]]'', which were used to construct [[doom guard]]s.

==Construction==
These scarabs required only a sufficiently experienced creator who knew the ''[[detect magic]]'' spell in order to successfully assemble one.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Valmous]]
