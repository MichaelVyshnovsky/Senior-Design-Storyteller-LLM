        "mainbody": "Bonesaw was a surgical tool occasionally used as a weapon, that possessed a minor enchantment.\nSome bonesaws bore a simple enchantment, similar to that of a +1 weapon that made it more deadly and easier to aim with. They came in a variety of designs. Some had sizable sharp teeth held in place by beautifully filigreed metalwork.\nIn the late 15 century DR, several of the bonesaws could be found in the House of Healing in Reithwin and in the hands of undead nurse Sister Hunna who served depraved Sharran surgeon Malus Thorm. Further north, Arla Razortongue of Luskan carried bonesaws.\nBonesaw 2.jpg\nCategoryPlus-1 items\nCategoryWeapons\nCategoryTools\nCategoryMedical tools\nCategoryMagic weapons\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryOne-handed weapons\nCategorySlashing weapons\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from West Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryItems from the Western Heartlands\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast North\nCategoryItems from Reithwin\nCategoryItems from the shadow-cursed lands\nCategoryItems from Baldurs Gate\nCategoryItems from Luskan\nj36ko84vx1lw7degdplnhab98cgz78x"
