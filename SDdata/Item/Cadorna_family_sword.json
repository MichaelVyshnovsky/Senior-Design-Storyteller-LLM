        "mainbody": "The Cadorna family sword was an enchanted commemorative greatsword created for the famous, or rather infamous \"dragon killer family\" of Phlan, House Cadorna.\nThe greatsword was a masterfully crafted cold iron blade. It was decorated with intricately engraved ornamentations along the blade, some of which were damaged by use throughout the years. The greatswords blade on one side contained an engraved Cadorna family history that began with a weavers loom and ended in a grand dragon battle. The other side held an engraved family tree with the last engraving as of 1351 DR on its hilt reading \"To Skullcrusher, For All Your Service â€“ P. Cadorna, 1351 DR.\"\nAs the Cadorna family sword was made out of cold iron, the blade was deadly to fey creatures, celestial eladrin, and demons. It also possessed a simple +1 enchantment that guided the wielders hand and ensured increased damage with each slash. The swords edge was ensorcelled with a keen magic that kept it sharp and gave it the potential to deal especially devastating damage.\nThe Cadorna family sword was forged to commemorate the 15 anniversary of the Cadorna family becoming famous and respected after Magnus Cadorna slew a dangerous red dragon who ravaged settlements of the Dragon Reach. When it was presented to Magnus, now an eighty-two-year-old man, he was thankful but considered the gesture quite silly.\nThe blade would remain with the Cadorna family, passed from father to son for four generations until it eventually left the \"dragon killer\" familys possession. The last Cadorna who wielded the blade was the infamous Porphyrys Cadorna, son of Eugenia Cadorna, the Cloth Merchant of Phlan.\nAfter the mans disgrace and being run out of town, the sword remained with Porphyrys for about ten years, until the , when Porphyrys, still without an offspring, gifted the sword to his trusted bodyguard Skullcrusher. Skullcrusher kept the sword close through his adventuring career and brought it to his secluded cottage in the Neverwinter Wood after he retired. In the , Skullcrusher was in his twilight years and often thought of what would happen to his possessions, namely magic weapons, after his inevitable death."
