'''''Potions of climbing''''' were magical [[potion]]s that temporarily allowed the user to rapidly climb steep surfaces.

==Description==
The liquid that composed a ''potion of climbing'' appeared to be separated into several layers of gray, silver, and brown colors that resembled bands of sedimentary rock. Agitating the liquid did not mix the layers.

==Powers==
Upon drinking a ''potion of climbing'', the user gained the power to climb as fast and as effortlessly as walking, for a duration of one hour. Even extremely difficult surfaces became considerably easier to climb while under the effect of the potion.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''potions of climbing'' were sold at [[Corellon's Crown]], an herbalism shop in [[Trollskull Alley]] in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]], run by the [[wood elf]] [[Fala Lefaliir]].
