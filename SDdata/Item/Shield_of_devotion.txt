Shields of devotion were enchanted shields said to had been wielded by the legendary Paladins of Velen many years before the late 15 century DR.
These decorated ancient shields possessed protective magics and granted divine spellcasters an additional spell from the first circle of magic. Additionally, shields of devotion allowed the wielders to cast the aid spell once per day.
Long before the late 15 century DR, shields of devotion were said to had belonged to the Paladins of Velen, an order of paladins so old, most though them to be nothing but fanciful legends. By the , Paladins of Velen were believed to be long-extinct and these shields were the only legacy they left behind. Still possessing powerful blessings, shields of devotion inspired many-a hero. One such shield belonged to the Harper quartermaster Talli, who filled druid Harper hero Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed Lands.
