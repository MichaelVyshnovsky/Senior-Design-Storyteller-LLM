        "mainbody": "* Diccon Picard, a jeweler of Ghars, Cormyr, circa 1367 DR, owned a Selgaunt fiddle but was not a great player.\n* Rinaldo, a self-styled bard in Easthaven, was fond of plucking a fiddle in the White Lady Inn while recounting the story of the White Lady ghost.\n* The cricket-like sprites known as grigs were masters of the fiddle. By playing a fiddle, they could compel creatures within  to dance uncontrollably, to the point of exhaustion. They could fashion tiny grig fiddles that would work for others, and their master fiddles were exquisite instruments capable of producing the most beautiful music, and granted grigs many of the powers of great bards.\n* Violins were a greatly favored instrument among elves, who loved their mellow sound.\n* The cities of Waterdeep and Selgaunt harbored craftsmen, many of whom were elven, capable of making high-quality violins. They could be ordered from Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, from which master-quality violins were also available for special orders and custom prices."
