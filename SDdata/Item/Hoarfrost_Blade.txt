The Hoarfrost Blade was a powerful magic longsword from the world of Oerth.
The Hoarfrost Blade possessed a set of various powerful magic enchantments. The blade itself was a +2 longsword that caused additional cold damage. The Hoarfrost Blade was especially effective against creatures not native to the Prime Material Plane, effectively becoming a +4 enchantment.
The user of the blade was able to cast the endure elements spell once per day.
According to sages, Hoarfrost Blades origins were from the world of Oerth. A hero of that world, Scaldulin, discovered the blade in the heart of a glacier and managed to acquire it. The Hoarfrost Blade was used by Scaldulin against a legion of demons in the fabled Battle of the Thousand Dead, and later, the blade sliced the hand of the powerful lich Scaroth the Warped of Blackmoor.
Eventually, the Hoarfrost Blade accompanied its master in his fall and transformation into a death knight, slaughtering a solar named Arazium in the process.
The blade made its way to Toril at some point before 1372 DR, broken in pieces. The swords blade was snapped and its shards were brought to Toril by Loru, a death slaad, and its haft was in the hands of half-celestial criminal Alaffinel. Eventually, the blade was reforged by the masterful strokes of Derval Ironeater of Daggerford in 1372 DR.
