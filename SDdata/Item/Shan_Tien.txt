'''''Shan Tien''''', or '''Lightning''', was a legendary magical [[spear]] of [[Shou Lung]] history.

==Powers==
Of [[artifact]]-level power, ''Shan Tien'' was a ''+4 spear'' with a number of magical powers. It could [[break any weapon]] thrice a day. It also could be used for [[teleportation]] three times a day and could [[heal]] someone to full health once a day. It was of [[lawful good]] nature.

==History==
The ancient [[Shou]] hero [[Chung Hsin Te]] was the first known wielder of ''Shan Tien''. In time, he passed it on to [[Tan Chin]], the heroic emperor of the First Kingdom of Shou Lung.

In [[-1370 DR|Shou Year −120 (−1370 DR)]], Tan Chin wielded ''Shan Tien'' when he fought the [[Black Leopard Cult]] at [[Durkon]]. There, with a sweep of ''Shan Tien'', Tan Chin cut the ''[[Ivory Chain of Pao]]'' and freed the [[Black Leopard]], who quickly seized the corrupt high priest [[Nan Kung Chi]] and dragged him screaming into the night, giving Tan Chin victory over the remaining cult.<ref>

However, when Tan Chin grew corrupted to evil, he was no longer able to wield ''Shan Tien''. It was stored in the Library of [[Kuo Meilan]], the imperial capital.

When the First Kingdom fell and Kuo Meilan destroyed, ''Shan Tien'' was stolen and never seen again.
