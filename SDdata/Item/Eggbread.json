        "Description": "Eggbread was a savory treat that was never served as a dessert. Most commonly, it was served with various [[gravies]], panfry drippings, and condiments made of [[spices]] like [[tamarind]]. Some travelers and caravaners were known for eating egg bread as a \"desperation fare,\" dripped with [[molasses]]. However, that was not considered a proper way to consume the dish. The most common way to eat it was smothered in fat droppings from frying [[pork]], topped with [[salted pork]] and [[cracklings]].",
        "Availability": "*In the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], ''circa'' [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], small eateries that traded in hot drinks and hot handfoods started cropping up throughout its various districts. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the city counted over 30 such establishments. One of the newly popular dishes found in many of them were eggbread buns topped with melted [[sugar]].\n*The [[Oak-Father's Boon]] inn in [[Tethyr]]ean town of [[Mosstone]] served medallions of eggbread with the signature [[bowl of hares]] dish â€“ long-stewed [[hare]] meat in [[clove]]s, [[cinnamon]], and [[leek]]."
