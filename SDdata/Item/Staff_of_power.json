Upon being broken, the staff had a 50% likelihood of transporting the wielder to another plane, or else the wielder would be destroyed by spell energy.\nA staff of power could also be used as +2 quarterstaff.\nIn the year , the name was used around Neverwinter to refer to a lesser staff which could only cast fireball, magic missile, and ray of enfeeblement. \nA variant had been crafted by the Simbul, known as a belt of power, which operated similarly but in belt form.\nAccording to Hasuraman the Muddled, a staff of power of the variant popular around Neverwinter could be created with the use of the feeblemind spell and a pair of bodak teeth, within the confines of a proper wizards laboratory.
