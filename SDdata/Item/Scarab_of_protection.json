        "mainbody": "Scarabs of protection were enchanted carved amulets that enveloped the wearer in a protective invisible barrier.\nScarabs of protection were usually carved out of stone to resemble a desert insect, a round bodied scarab. The main telltale sign of its magical protective properties was evident when a scarab was held for over six seconds, when the item manifested an arcane inscription on its surface.\nWhen exposed to a detect magic spell effect, scarabs of protection radiated strong abjuration and necromancy energy.\nThe magic imbued within these scarabs carried greatly and usually depended on the carvers skills. The invisible magical protective field that surrounded the wearer increased their defenses against magical and mundane negative effects.\nA more powerful version of scarabs of protection gave the wearer powerful spell resistance and allowed them to negate magical attacks up to twelve times. Such attacks could be energy-draining, instant death effects, and adverse energy effects. After a scarab absorbed twelve such spells, it shattered and destroyed.\nScarabs of protection could be created by a skilled crafter of wondrous items and the use of death ward and spell resistance spells.\nThe sages determined the origins of these bug-shaped magical items to lay somewhere far south from the Sword Coast, but the exact location and time of creation remained undetermined. By late 14 century, these scarabs could  be found in many places along the Sword Coast, and cities such as Neverwinter.\n*Alasklerbanbastos, the great undead wyrm of Dragonback Mountain had a scarab in his hoard.\n*Dracandros of the Crimson, a villainous Red Wizard carried a scarab of protection during his time with the New Alliance.\n*Eltoora Sarptyl of Port Last owned a scarab of the +2 enchantments circa 1372 DR.\n*Jarlaxle, a drow mercenary leader owned a plethora of defensive magical items, including one of the scarabs of protection.\n*Husher Clay in Beorunnas Well circa 1372 DR.\n*Ophala Cheldarstorn of Neverwinter was in possession of one of these amulets in 1372 DR.\n*Rhessajan Ambermantle the ruler of Scornubel circa 1367 DR carried one of the scarabs.\n*Tchazzar, the Chosen of Tiamat red dragon had a scarab of protection as a part of his treasure hoard.\n*Valdemar, a green dragon who resided in Undermountain could never be encountered without his trusty scarab."
