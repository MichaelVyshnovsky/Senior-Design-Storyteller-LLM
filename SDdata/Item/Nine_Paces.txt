Nine Paces was an enchanted polearm designed specifically for hunting arctic boars of Icewind Dale.
Apart from being an oaken spear, the runes on its haft allowed Nine Paces to strike at a one-third longer distance than an average weapon of the kind. The same carved symbols gave it a simple +1 wounding enchantment, guiding the hand of the wielder to strike true. However, its magics did not affect creatures that could only be harmed by enchanted weapons.
The weapon was thought to originate from north Faer√ªn, judging by it being used for hunting white-furred arctic boars and the magical sigils engraved along the shaft, typical for the region. In the , Nine Paces belonged to the Gallaway Trade Depot. It was made available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her familys trading house in Targos.
