'''''Nine Paces''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[polearm]] designed specifically for hunting [[arctic boar]]s of [[Icewind Dale]].

==Powers==
Apart from being an [[oak]]en [[spear]], the runes on its haft allowed ''Nine Paces'' to strike at a one-third longer distance than an average weapon of the kind. The same carved symbols gave it a simple ''+1 [[Wounding (weapon quality)|wounding]]'' enchantment, guiding the hand of the wielder to strike true. However, its magics did not affect creatures that could only be harmed by enchanted weapons.

==History==
The weapon was thought to originate from [[north Faer√ªn]], judging by it being used for hunting white-furred arctic [[boar]]s and the magical sigils engraved along the shaft, typical for the region. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Nine Paces'' belonged to the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]]. It was made available for purchase from [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in her family's trading house in [[Targos]].
