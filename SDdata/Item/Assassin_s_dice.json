        "mainbody": "Assassins dice was a set of two enchanted mythic dice, used as a unique sort of ranged weapon by assassins of the Underdark.\nAssassins dice were carved out of a green substance with a skull carving on one of their sides. The dice radiated a green magical glow.\nThese wondrous items were used as weapons, thrown at the assassins enemies. The dice thrown determined the targets fate upon collision dramatically reduced ability to land a successful attack, reduced chance of landing powerful lucky blows, crippled ability to avoid attacks, and removed ability to deflect blows.\nThe dices powers were boosted if used as a set that included the assassins choker and assassins belt, boosting the assassins chances of landing lucky deadly strikes and their chances of avoiding incoming attacks.\nAssassins dice were among the enchanted items found deep within the Northdark Reaches of the Underdark in the late 15 century DR."
