        "mainbody": "A '''''scroll of protection from possession''''' was a [[scroll]] capable of protecting the reader from any attempts at possession.",
        "Powers": "Reading this scroll generated a {{SI|10|ft}} sphere that moved around the reader, protecting anyone inside the sphere from magical forms of possession or mental control such as a ''[[magic jar]]'' [[spell]]. These effects lasted for ten minutes to one hour, but a small percentage of these scrolls lasted for several hours but conjured a stationary sphere of protection.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Hasan ibn al-Din]], a [[Corsair (kit)|corsair]] travelling the [[Great Sea]] near [[Zakhara]], carried a ''scroll of protection from possession''."
