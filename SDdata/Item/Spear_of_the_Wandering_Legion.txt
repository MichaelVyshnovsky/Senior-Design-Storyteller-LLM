The Spear of the Wandering Legion was a magical weapon that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spear had an intricately etched shaft of slim silver.
When struck on the ground three times by a servant of the Grand Caliph this spear would summon several hundred faris to serve the wielder. The summoned farisan did not appear magically, rather they had to arrive by conventional means. These individuals were the descendants of the Wandering Legion and would only serve the wielder if they upheld the Law of the Loregiver.
