The material was laborious to produce: every 10 minutes of burning time took roughly 3 days to create, so that a candle that burned for up to an hour and a half took up almost one entire month to produce. These magic candles, after burning for their full duration in the presence of a subject within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}, granted a variety of effects, some of which increased with longer exposition times. Mystic-produced candles included:\n* ''[[Love candle]]s'', red candles that produced an effect similar to that of a ''[[philter of love]]''.\n* ''[[Protection candle]]s'', blue candles that created the effect of a ''[[protection from evil]]'' or ''[[protection from good]]'' [[spell]].\n* ''[[Truth candle]]s'', purple candles that forced a subject to truthfully answer a number of questions that depended on the burning duration.\n* ''[[Healing candle]]s'', gold-colored candles that provided magical healing that increased for longer burning durations.\n* ''[[Telepathy candle]]s'', yellow candles that permitted [[Telepathy|telepathic]] communication between a mystic and the subject, for as long as the candle burned.\n* ''[[Fortune candle]]s'', green candles that created the effect of a ''[[stone of good luck]]'' for a number of days that depended on the burning duration.\n* ''[[Purification candle]]s'', white candles that created the effects of the ''[[remove curse]]'', ''[[abjure]]'', or ''[[banishment]]'' spells, or that provided the benefits of drinking an ''[[elixir of health]]''.\n* ''[[Empowerment candle]]s'', silver candles that empowered the subject's spells in an effect similar to an ''[[incense of meditation]]''.\n* ''[[Curse candle]]s'', black candles that inflicted a number of [[curse]]s on the subject."
