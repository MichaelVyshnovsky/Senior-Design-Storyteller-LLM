        "mainbody": "Talismans of spell turning were talismans that protected a wearer against magical attacks and reflected those spells back at the caster.\nTalsimans of spell turning were crafted from silver, iris agate, and crushed dragon bone. They weighed about a pound (half a kilogram) and would sell in most markets of Faer√ªn for around 2,800 gold pieces. They emitted a moderate abjuration aura to those who could detect such things.\nWhen the wearer of one of these talismans pressed it to bare skin, the magic would offer protection as soon as the wearer was targeted by an attackers spell. The talisman would then crumble to dust, and for one minute, the talismans resonating field would reflect back between one and five low-powered and targeted ranged spells.\nFabrication of such a talisman required the creator to know the spell lesser spell turning.\nTalsimans of spell turning were invented by the adepts, witch doctors, and shamans of the Thousand Fists tribe of orcs from the Nether Mountains. When the Nethertide Horde sought to plunder the city of Silverymoon in the , the talismans allowed the orcs to survive many of the spells from the ambushing wizards of the Moonlight Men in the Battle of Turnstone Pass. (The Moonlight Men were ultimately victorious, however.)\nAfterward, the cambion Kaanyr Vhok learned the secrets of the talismans creation, and he and his bands of tanarukka actively began to spread the knowledge of how to craft them to other tribes in other mountains&mdashsuch as the Rauvin Mountains and the Greypeaks&mdashand in the Fallen Lands."
