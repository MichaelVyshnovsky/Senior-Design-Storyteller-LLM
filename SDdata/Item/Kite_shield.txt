'''Kite shields''', also known as '''body shields''' or '''large shields''', were a large-sized style of [[shield]] in the Realms that were sometimes conflated with [[tower shield]]s.<ref group="note" name="kite">Some sources, such as the [[Baldur's Gate series]] and [[Icewind Dale series]], refer to kite shields as being another name for [[tower shield]]s. Other sources, such as [[Player's Option: Combat & Tactics]], contradict this claim. Because the two are distinct types of shields out-of-universe, it is assumed the two were lumped together due to being similarly large shields. Also of note, the icons used for large shields in ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'' and the Icewind Dale series depict a tower shield, while the icons used in ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'' depict a kite shield.

==Description==
Kite shields were long in shape, with wide tops and narrow pointed bottoms, providing their wielders more coverage than a [[buckler]] shield. The pointed bottom edge of these could be driven into the ground to provide their users a stable defense against assaults.

==Availability==
* A number of merchants in [[Athkatla]]'s market [[Waukeen's Promenade]] commonly sold kite shields, including the armorer [[Arnolinus]], the fruit merchant [[Enge]], the merchant [[Mira]], and [[Ribald Barterman]] from his store [[Adventurer Mart]]. In the [[Athkatla/Bridge District|Bridge]] district, one could find them for sale from the innkeeper of [[Delosar's Inn]] and at the street-side stalls of [[Bel Dalemark]] and [[Sio'chaire]]. And in the [[Athkatla/Wave District|Wave District]], one could find them for sale by the merchant [[Jahaboam]].
