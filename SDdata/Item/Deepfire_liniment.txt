Deepfire liniment was a type of oil-based external medicine used to relieve stiffness, aches, and pains of old wounds.
Circa 1348 DR, Maglor the Apothecary, secretly an agent from Zhentil Keep, in the town of Eveningstar of Cormyr, concocted medicines for the locals, including deepfire liniments. One of his regular clients was an old warrior named Beldrak, who used deepfire liniments to soothe his old aching wounds.
