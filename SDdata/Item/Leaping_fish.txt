The '''''leaping fish''''' was a magical chalice that was one of the ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'', a collection of magical vessels created by the [[Han people]] of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.

==Description==
It was carved in the shape of a fish with its open mouth serving as the cup.

==Powers==
When a bearer filled the vessel with fine oil and lit it like an oil lamp, it glowed pale blue. They could make one ''[[wish]]'' that would be granted, as if cast by a great [[wu jen]].

==History==
As one of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', the ''leaping fish''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. 

The [[shukenja]] [[Pitalla]] used a ''wish'' from the ''leaping fish'' to cure the settlement of [[Mo'ki]] of the [[ivory plague]]. He was believed to have then taken it to the island of [[Su'un]] and left it there.

It remained lost by the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].
