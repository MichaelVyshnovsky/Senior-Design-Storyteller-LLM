'''Vanilla''' was a delicate [[spice]] from [[Maztica]]. It was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Description==
Vanilla was a bean harvested from an exotic type of orchid in the Maztican jungles. To preserve its delicate flavors, vanilla beans purchased through ''Aurora's'' were individually sealed in [[vial]]s.

==Availability==
Beyond Maztica, vanilla was known to grow in the jungle of [[Malatra]].{{Cite polyhedron/129/Agriculture, Invention, and Society in Malatra|30}} Vanilla was a feature of the spice trade through the town of [[Pursai]] in [[Laothan]].<ref>

==Usages of Vanilla==
* [[Athkatlan clarry]] was a heavily vanilla flavored and spiced ruby-red [[wine]] from [[Athkatla]], the capital of [[Amn]].{{cite web| url = http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_010203-05.htm| title = Jan â€“ Mar 2005| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}
* The native [[Nubari]] of Malatra used vanilla for ritual purposes and as a [[perfume]].{{Cite polyhedron/129/Agriculture, Invention, and Society in Malatra|30}}
* Vanilla essence was used in making of pastries, including the recipe for ''[[the Bitnez Pavlova Extraordinaire!]]'' as appeared in ''[[101 Garlic Recipes]]'' by [[Rab Bitnez]].

==Trivia==
* [[Mindflayer]]s that were healthy from brain-rich diets excreted a thin film of slimy, glistening mucus that gave off a faint odor that was sometimes described as similar to vanilla, although this smell was imperceptible from afar.
