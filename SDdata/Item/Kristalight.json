        "Description": "''Kristalight'' was a mostly clear {{SI|1'0|'\"|long=yes}}-long and {{SI|0'1|'\"|long=yes}}-wide chunk of an elongated hexagonal crystal, seeming of natural origin.\n\nIt was a fragile item. A fall from a height of {{SI|3'0|'\"|long=yes}} was sure to shatter ''Kristalight,'' and it could not be fixed apart from via a powerful casting of the ''[[mend]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Powers": "When the item's [[command word]]s, \"Orthala, Orthala, magic crystal, give light,\" were uttered, the item began emitting strong strobing light in the area of {{SI|6'0|'\"|long=yes}} in diameter. To stop, the user had to say \"Orthala, Orthala, make the light cease.\"",
        "History": "''Kristalight'' was one of the more unique items available from the [[Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop]] in the Living City, [[Raven's Bluff]], run by [[Misti Morgan]], a proprietor of the establishment and a [[thief]], in the late 14{{th}} century DR."
