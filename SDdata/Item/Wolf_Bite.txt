Wolf Bite was a small enchanted shield that belonged to Jon Kellan, the leader of the Wolf Pack mercenary company.
This jagged shield held a +1 enchantment and allowed even unskilled wielder to know their opponents down using the Wolf Bite.
Wolf Bite traveled with its owner and his mercenary company from Icewind Dale to the City of Splendors, Waterdeep, where they became employed by one of the citys Lords. Their task led them to a battle with Zhentarim, the battle from which they never returned. However, it did make the Black Network halt their plans to attack Waterdeep. In 1372 DR, Wolf Bite could  be found on its owners long-dead body on the bottom of the foreboding hole in the Eastern Farmlands outside of Daggerford.
