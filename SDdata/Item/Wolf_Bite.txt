'''''Wolf Bite''''' was a small [[enchanted]] [[shield]] that belonged to [[Jon Kellan]], the leader of the [[Wolf Pack]] mercenary company.

==Powers==
This jagged shield held a ''+1'' enchantment and allowed even unskilled wielder to know their opponents down using the ''Wolf Bite''.

==History==
''Wolf Bite'' traveled with its owner and his mercenary company from [[Icewind Dale]] to the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], where they became employed by one of the city's [[Lords of Waterdeep|Lords]]. Their task led them to a battle with [[Zhentarim]], the battle from which they never returned. However, it did make the Black Network halt their plans to attack Waterdeep. In [[1372 DR]], ''Wolf Bite'' could  be found on its owner's long-dead body on the bottom of the foreboding hole in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] outside of [[Daggerford]].
