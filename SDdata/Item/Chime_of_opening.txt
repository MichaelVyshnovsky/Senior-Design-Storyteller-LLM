A '''''chime of opening''''' was a [[magic item]] capable of opening locks, latches, or doors by its sonic vibrations.

==Description==
Typical ''chimes of opening'' were hollow [[mithral]] tubes about {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} long and weighing about {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
The user could strike a ''chime of opening'' while pointing it to an object that possessed some sort of closed opening such as a door, lid, latch, or valve, out to a range of up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. The chime sent out a clear tone that unlocked one of the locks keeping the object closed, or the object itself if it only had one lock.

The chime could even bypass certain magical effects such as ''[[hold portal]]'' or ''[[arcane lock]]'' [[spell]]s. However, if the sound could not reach the object, such as if blocked by a ''[[silence]]'' spell or similar effect, it did not have any effect.

The chime could be used up to ten times, after which it shattered and lost its powers.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], a ''chime of opening'' could be found in one of the cluttered tables with "antiques" in [[Torleth's Treasures]] of [[Gillian's Hill]].
