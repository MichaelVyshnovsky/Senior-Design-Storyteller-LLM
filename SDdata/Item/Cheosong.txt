A '''cheosong''' was a type of dress worn by cosmopolitan women of [[Shou Lung]].

==Description==
A cheosong was a narrow, form-fitting dress. The slitted skirt typically reached almost to the ground. The tight bodice had a high collar and front buttons. Most cheosong were made from fine [[silk]] and embroidered in gold or silk thread depicting mythological imagery that wrapped around the woman from chest to hem.

==Reputation==
A cheosong had two slits in the skirt that extended as high as even the hips, making the dress too revealing for many women to feel comfortable wearing in public.

==Variants==
Older women were known to wear a less-revealing version of the cheosong called the '''cheo-sam'''. A cheo-sam did not have the slitted skirt and was a looser garment, much like a robe. It maintained the high collar of a cheosong but added extra-baggy sleeves.
