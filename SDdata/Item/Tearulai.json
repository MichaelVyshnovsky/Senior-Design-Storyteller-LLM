        "Description": "The sword ''Tearulai'' shone with a faint green radiance. It was beautifully crafted, with a blade of pure [[emerald]] and a hilt of [[platinum]]. Complementing the blade, its pommel was inset with three smaller emeralds.\n\nThe sword possessed exceptional intelligence along with a strong and charismatic personality. It was exceptionally vain and had a particular fondness for valuable [[gem]]s, seeking to improve its appearance by adding more exquisite decorations to its [[scabbard]]. It greatly admired fine art and poetry and longed to return home to Myth Drannor within the forests of [[Cormanthor]].",
        "Powers": "[[Item enchantment|Enchanted]] as a ''+3 [[sword of sharpness]]'', ''Tearulai'' had a number of inherent magical properties. It could ''[[detect gem]]s'' and ''[[See invisibility|invisible objects]]'',\n\nIn the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], it allowed its wielder to cast ''[[polymorph self]]'' once per day and ''[[pass plant]]'' twice per day. As of the 15{{th}} century DR, it possessed six magical charges and allowed its wielder to use the aforementioned abilities and also allowed them to ''[[fly]]''.\n\n''Tearulai'' could not be destroyed by any known means and could not be ''[[teleport]]ed'' without the accompaniment of its wielder. No [[evil]] beings could successfully bear the sword, and any wielder who took actions against its nature could potentially be dominated by its consciousness.",
        "History": "The first known appearance of ''Tearulai'' was in the hands of a [[fighter]] who ventured into Undermountain with a band of fellow adventurers, having reached the level of [[Wyllowwood]]. The group was ambushed by Yinark, one of the apprentices of the [[archmage]] [[Halaster Blackcloak]], master of Undermountain. Before his own death, Yinark slew most of the trespassers and the sword remained within the woods.\n\nHalaster recovered ''Tearulai'' and found he, nor any of his associates, could neither destroy nor wield the emerald blade. It was protected by a [[stone golem]] that was specifically created to function underwater and protect the sword upon its death. After she killed her husband Yinark, Wyllow ''[[stone shape|inscribed]]'' a poem in [[Elven language|elven]], detailing the story of ''Tearulai'' on a large [[moss]]-covered stone located near the pond.\n{{Fq\n| float  = \n| width  = 30\n| source = An excerpt of the story of Tearulai\n| text   = ''Tearulai's owner by my love was slain,<br/>Then I killed my love, my mind reeling in pain.''<br/>\n''The Mad Wizard hid it,<br/>the blade could not die.<br/>Hid it, he feared it,<br/>beneath this false sky.''<br/>\n''Tearulai's heart is trapped 'neath a wave.<br/>Would that I had such a comforting grave.''\n}}\n\nAt some point before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], the sword had been recovered from beneath the pond by another adventurer.{{Waterdeep-time}} When this individual found themself in a battle with the green dragon Valdemar, they thrust ''Tearulai'' into the skull of the young dragon, but failed to slay the beast.\n\nThe malevolent dragon, which had been used as a guardian of sorts by the druid Wyllow, had a significant change of heart (or perhaps mind) after the intelligent sword became implanted within its head.
