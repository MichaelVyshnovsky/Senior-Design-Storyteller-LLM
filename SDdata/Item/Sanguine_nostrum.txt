'''''Sanguine nostrum''''' was a [[magic]]al seasoning for an enemy's heart.

==Description==
''Sanguine nostrum'' came in vials with each vial holding one application. The actual content came on powder form.

==Powers==
As mentioned above, ''sanguine nostrum'' was a seasoning. It was mixed with blood of a dead person who was dead for a minute at maximum and then to the heart of the person. On eating this heart, the eater received the benefits of a ''[[moment of prescience]]'' [[spell]]. The strength of this spell grew stronger as stronger the person whose heart the user ate was.
