The '''''Hammer of Justice''''' was the [[enchanted]] [[warhammer]], wielded by a heroic [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]] from [[Myth Drannor]], [[Bannoc]].

==Description==
The ''Hammer of Justice'' was a masterfully-crafter one-handed warhammer.

==Powers==
This hammer was a powerful magic item, imbued with a ''+1'' enchantment that effectively became ''+3'' when wielded against [[undead]] creatures. Additionally, the ''Hammer of Justice'' doubled the harm and punishment dispensed on the undead.

==History==
The ''Hammer of Justice'' was interred with its owner Bannoc in one of the crypts within the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the hammer was still inside its master's sarcophagus. The cleric of Tyr was cursed to haunt the place of his burial as a [[wraith]], ready to attack any would-be grave robber to protect his magic hammer.
