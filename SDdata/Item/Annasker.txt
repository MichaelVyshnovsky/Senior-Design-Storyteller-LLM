'''Annasker''' was a type of [[ale]], or "small beer," named after the family who produced it and renowned for its refreshing taste throughout the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Annasker was a lightly pink-colored sparkling ale. It tasted refreshingly sweet yet tart, somewhat similar to the taste of [[lemonade]] mixed with [[berry juice]].

Annasker was popular among merchants and traders for its ease of transportation. Because of that, annasker was found commonly on the Sword Coast, all along the [[Trade Way]], as far north as the city of [[Luskan]].
