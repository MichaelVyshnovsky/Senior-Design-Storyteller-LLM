        "Powers": "This magic armor glowed in sinister dim red light, illuminating {{SI|5'|'\"|long=yes}} around it. When the armor was hit, it projected the weakening magics onto the attacker, similar to that of the ''[[doom]]'' spell. Additionally, the wearer of the ''Blood of the Child'' gained ability to use ''[[scare]]'' and ''[[vampiric touch]]'' spells once per day each.",
        "History": "The ''Blood of the Child'' first appeared in history records in the scorching hot land of [[Zakhara]]. The creation process of this armor included being tempered in the fiery breath of [[red dragon]]s and bathed in blood of sacrificial children. The dark armor only had a handful of owners throughout its history as only few were so blinded by lust for power and lacked empathy to use this evil magic item.\n\nThe plate's latest wearers was a [[vampire]] assassin [[Nosfiraat]] who traveled to the [[Sword Coast]] from Zakhara. His ship crashed along the [[Blade Cliffs]] of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] and the vampire stayed trapped in the wreck as late as [[1372 DR]]."
