        "mainbody": "Udderfish venom was a poison extracted from the fangs or spines of the udderfish. It was harvested by pirates from the Nelanther Isles and sold to merchants in Skullport and Waterdeep.\nThis substance was a thick, whitish liquid that tasted vaguely sweet. It could be mixed with water or alcohol and still retain its potency. A single dose typically cost 400 gp.\nA victim that imbibed this poison (and did not manage to resist it) was not likely to notice the effects at first, perhaps passing it off as a headache or mild body aches, but soon they felt as if they had taken a real beating or been stepped on by a giant.\nElsk Thavarask, the proprietor of the Missing Minotaur tavern in Everlund, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, was known to use this substance to quiet down extremely rowdy customers. He would also sell it to people he trusted."
