        "mainbody": "'''Sledges''' were a type of large [[sled]] that were usually used to haul cargo or large numbers of passengers.",
        "Description": "These sleds had runners along their bottom that allowed a sledge to be pulled by a team of animals, such as [[dog]]s, [[horse]]s,",
        "Availability": "Places in the Realms where one could find sledges for sale included the following:\n* In the village of [[Aunkspear]], where they were manufactured by the woodcarver [[Ubargh Jarn]].\n* [[Elgath's Provisions]] in the city of [[Archenbridge]].\n* [[Felsharp's Furniture]] in the hamlet of [[White Ford]].\n* [[Samborl's Sundries-in-Trade]] in the small town of [[Asbravn]].\n* [[Thunderwood Forays]] in the city of [[Berdusk]].\n* [[Waelvur's Wagonworks]] in [[Red Larch]] manufactured sledges for use by nearby quarries.\n* [[The Way Inn]] had a trailwares shop that sold sledges.",
        "History": "In [[1367 DR]], sometime around the month of [[Alturiak]], a sledge caravan that was bucking heavy snows west of [[Priapurl]] was attacked at dusk by a group of [[drow]] raiders whilst it was making its way towards a sheltered campsite. The caravan managed to fend off the drow and send them fleeing thanks to two of its members being minor [[wizard]]s.\n\nAround the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Ras Nsi]] sought to gather [[Chultan]] wood to sell to the thriving cities of the [[Western Heartlands]]. To accomplish this he had his [[earth elemental]]s uproot trees, gangs of [[zombie]]s load them on to sledges, and then had those pulled by [[dinosaur]]s.\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen]], the [[Wheelwrights' Guild]], and the [[Wagon-makers' and Coach Builders' Guild]] began working worked together to convert some [[dray]]s and [[hire-coach]]es into sledges so that they could remain fully operational throughout the harshest parts of the winter season.",
        "Notable Users of Sledges": {
            "Groups": "* Some members of the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen were known to own sledges.\n* The [[Stonemasons Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] used sledges to transport stone down from their mountain quarry and north to their warehouse in the city's [[Ravens Bluff/Southside District|Southside District]].",
            "Races": "* Back on their home planet of [[Athas]], the [[thri-kreen]] frequently built and used sledges to transport more fragile materials, such as their eggs. They constructed these from the large bones and sinews of their prey, or from a single scale of a [[hatori|greater hatori]].",
            "Regions & Settlements": "* In the region of [[Anauroch]], one could find \"sand-sledges\" or sledges that had been adapted for use in its desert environment.\n* In the icy reaches of [[north Faerûn]], it was common for caravans to transport goods by means of sledges.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/81/The Everwinking Eye: As Cold As Bare Fingers|8}} For example, both the inhabitants of [[Grunwald]] and [[Kheldell]] used sledges to transport stripped logs and milled wood respectively. And the [[gnoll]]s that lived in the [[Frozen Flindyke]] transported ore from [[Mount Ghaethlauntar]] by means of sledge caravans.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|63}}\n* In the more southernly reaches of north Faerûn, sledges could be found in use in much of [[the Dalelands]].\n* In [[northwest Faerûn]], during the winter or simply rent a sledge.\n* During the winter time, if guests at the Waterdhavian inn [[The Jade Jug]] desired to go out in the city, the inn would have a sledge brought around to transport them.\n* Also in northwest Faerûn, quarries in that region were known to use sledges.\n* In [[south Faerûn]], sledges were one of many vehicles used to transport goods to the city of [[Khôltar]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|71-72}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 56: Khôltar, Part 7, Leaving the Farrgaunlar}}  In [[Zehoarastria]], once a year the winter weather made overland roads so impassable for draft beasts and wagons that in the city of [[Crimmor]] the only means of moving goods was sledges laboriously pulled by [[human]]s. And even then, only for short trips.{{Cite dragon/334/Crimmor: City of Caravans|32}}\n* Beyond [[Faerûn]], sledges were sometimes used in the jungles of [[Chult]]."
