'''Saganite''', also known as "needle stone", "love stone", or "hairstone", was a variety of [[chalcedony]] that encased many needlelike inclusions.

==Description==
Saganite was usually a bone white to yellow stone with contrasting brown or greenish-black needles. The needles most often radiated from a central point like a star. Large samples were common and it was often traded as "a fist of saganite" in the marketplaces of [[Amn]].

==Powers==
This stone, when added to the material component of any spell that produced explosions or bursts of fire, increased the power of the detonation or flame by a small amount.
