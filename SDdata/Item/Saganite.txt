Saganite, also known as "needle stone", "love stone", or "hairstone", was a variety of chalcedony that encased many needlelike inclusions.
Saganite was usually a bone white to yellow stone with contrasting brown or greenish-black needles. The needles most often radiated from a central point like a star. Large samples were common and it was often traded as "a fist of saganite" in the marketplaces of Amn.
This stone, when added to the material component of any spell that produced explosions or bursts of fire, increased the power of the detonation or flame by a small amount.
