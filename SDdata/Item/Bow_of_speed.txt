Bows of speed were enchanted bows, popular among the thieves of Waterdeep circa 1370 DR.
Various bows of speed looked utterly mundane but possessed a set of handy enchantments. Apart from a +1 enchantment, the bows magic also pulled undamaged and non-magical arrows to the wielder from within  around it. Once the bowstring was pulled back, a random arrow in the area teleported unto to the wielders hand, ready to be shot. This enchantment allowed for a dramatically increased fire rate.
Some rare bows of speed were able to pull enchanted and magical arrows to the bowstring, as well as regular ones.
In 1370 DR, Shadow Thieves returned to Waterdeep, operating from a secret stronghold within Undermountain. Many of their higher-ranking members were armed with bows of speed, making them swift and dangerous opponents to the adventuring folk and the hero known as the Khelbenite.
