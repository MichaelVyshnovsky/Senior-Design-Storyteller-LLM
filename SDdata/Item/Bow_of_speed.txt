'''''Bows of speed''''' were enchanted [[bow]]s, popular among the [[thieves]] of [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].

==Powers==
Various ''bows of speed'' looked utterly mundane but possessed a set of handy enchantments. Apart from a ''+1'' enchantment, the bow's magic also pulled undamaged and non-magical [[arrow]]s to the wielder from within {{SI|108|'"|long=yes}} around it. Once the [[bowstring]] was pulled back, a random arrow in the area ''[[teleport]]ed'' unto to the wielder's hand, ready to be shot. This enchantment allowed for a dramatically increased fire rate.

Some rare ''bows of speed'' were able to pull enchanted and magical arrows to the bowstring, as well as regular ones.

==History==
In 1370 DR, [[Shadow Thieves]] returned to Waterdeep, operating from a secret stronghold within [[Undermountain]]. Many of their higher-ranking members were armed with ''bows of speed'', making them swift and dangerous opponents to the adventuring folk and the hero known as the [[Khelbenite]].
