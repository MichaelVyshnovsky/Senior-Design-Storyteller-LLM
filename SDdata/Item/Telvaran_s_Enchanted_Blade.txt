Telvarans Enchanted Blade was a famous lost magical sword as of the mid–14 century DR.
It possessed all the same powers as a rod of lordly might, and others that were not recorded.
In Tsurlagol in the Vast in the late 1350s DR, an unnamed female human adventurer presented a magical sword to the sage Othiiyr Velthrann for identification. He found it to Telvarans Enchanted Blade. But the client teleported away without even paying, so Othiiyr revealed the finding to others—when a client didnt pay, it was permitted to break the traditional bond of secrecy meant to exist between sages and clients. Its location and ownership remained unknown.
