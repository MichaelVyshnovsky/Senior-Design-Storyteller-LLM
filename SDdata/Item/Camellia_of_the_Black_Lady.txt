Camellia of the Black Lady was a magical flower.
A camellia of the Black Lady was a white flower that never lost its sweet, yet overpowering, scent or luster. It gave off the impression of some form of wrongness when the inner whorls were investigated.
A camellia of the Black Lady was carried around in the hair, barring the wearer to wear magical helmets or hats.
A camellia of the Black Ladys powers were activated by pressing the flowers stem and could be done so only once. The target was assaulted by three effects, a dominate person, a remorseless charm, and a delayed poison effect, when he or she came closer than 20 feet (6 meters) to the flowers wearer. The first and last effect were harder for followers Sel√ªne to defend themselves against.
The dominate person effect allowed the flowers wearer to order the target around. That was when the aforementioned remorseless charm effect kicked in. That effect made away with the targets conscience. These two effects lasted  for nine days, someone dispelled the dominate person effect, or the camellia of the Black Lady was destroyed, whichever came first. No matter which of these three options happened, the target fell victim to Shars vengefulness in the form of the aforementioned poison effect.
A camellia of the Black Ladys dangerous effects were, as mentioned above, only usable once, but the flower retained its permanent luster and scent.
A camellia of the Black Lady could be created by someone who was adept at crafting wondrous items and had access to the dominate person, poison, and remorseless charm spells.
The Black Lady whose name was part of the camellia of the Black Lady was a Sharran killer for hire who was very subtle in her jobs. It was not clear when exactly she was active.
