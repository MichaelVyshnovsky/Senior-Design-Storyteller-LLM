Pipestone, was also known as catlinite.
Pipestone was a soft stone, easily carved. It occurred in colors from brown to red. A typical stone was priced at 1 gp per pound (4 sp 5cp per kilogram).
Wizard spells that required some type of wood as a material component could use pipestone instead. This did not work for divine spells.
