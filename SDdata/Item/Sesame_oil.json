        "Availability": "Places in the Realms where sesame was known to be produced or sold included:\n* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] sold sesame oil at a standard price of 10 [[gold piece]]s per {{SI|1|gal}}.\n* In the desert region of [[Anauroch]], the [[Bedine]] tribes were known to produce sesame oil by placing sesame seeds in large mortars, hollowed out from an [[acacia]] tree. They would then crush the seeds with a wooden beam, counter-weighted with stones, by having a [[camel]] haul it around in a circle. The Bedine sold this oil in [[clay]] [[jug]]s for 1 [[sp]].",
        "Notable Users": "Bedine tribesmen were known to rub a mixture of the oil and [[indigo]] on their chests and legs during the winter season, believing it would keep them warm."
