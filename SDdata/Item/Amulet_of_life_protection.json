        "mainbody": "An amulet of life protection was an enchanted piece of jewelry that offered protection for the psyche.\nSuch amulets built after the Spellplague resembled rough chunks of clear-cut crystal with a golden chain.\nEarly information on such amulets claimed they made one immune to mind blast alongside mental influence. They were partway effective against the lifestealing powers of a demilich. However, it was not useful against a Deck of many things, as it would simply be itself cast into a hidden plane with the wearers soul still inside.\nWhen worn, these amulets and brooches protected against magic jar and similar magical attacks that attempted to take control of the victims body. If the wearer was killed their spirit would enter the amulet and remain for seven days, departing for the afterlife when this time expired. Destroying an amulet of life protection that housed a spirit would utterly annihilate the spirit.\nBy the , such amulets as found in Ravens Bluff could prevent the passing of the soul into the Fugue Plane, allowing anyone to be resurrected within a space of 24 hours if they were healed.\nAmulets created after the Spellplague increased the time through which one could still be raised from the dead, and improved the wearers defenses in life somewhat.\nOne such amulet was meant to be used in an assassination attempt against Karsus.\nMortimar of Netheril used one, smashed, to stage the death of his partner, Parzal.\nThe amulets used in Ravens Bluff required the magic jar spell.\n* Ametned-thoth, a wizard-priest from Skullport.\n* Tulrun\n* Homayoun Bey\n* Rogart Perilhaven may have worn a Greenstone amulet or one such amulet.\n* The Masked One of Aglarond.\n* Gadaric Main"
