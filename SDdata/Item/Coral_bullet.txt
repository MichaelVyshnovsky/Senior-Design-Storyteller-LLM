'''''Coral bullets''''' were [[enchanted]] [[sling]] missiles often used by sailors and pirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]] and the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Powers==
''Coral bullets'' were crafted out of [[coral]] nodules shaped into spheres. Unlike regular sling bullets, ''coral bullets'' produced ear-piercing sounds when flung at targets. These bullets dealt sonic damage and had a chance of dazing their targets. The sound they produced was similar to that of a boatswain's whistle.

==History==
''Coral bullets'' were in common use in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Captain [[Allendry]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale.
