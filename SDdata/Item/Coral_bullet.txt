Coral bullets were enchanted sling missiles often used by sailors and pirates of the Nelanther Isles and the Sea of Swords.
Coral bullets were crafted out of coral nodules shaped into spheres. Unlike regular sling bullets, coral bullets produced ear-piercing sounds when flung at targets. These bullets dealt sonic damage and had a chance of dazing their targets. The sound they produced was similar to that of a boatswains whistle.
Coral bullets were in common use in the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale.
