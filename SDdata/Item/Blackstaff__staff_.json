        "mainbody": "The '''Blackstaff''' was the name for a series of powerful magical staves, created and used by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] and/or his successor.",
        "Description": {
            "Khelben's Blackstaff": "It was believed that Khelben Arunsun, who carried the first [[Blackstaff]] title, selected a new Blackstaff every time he left [[Blackstaff Tower]]. However, it always appeared as a long wooden staff. It was longer than an average human was tall, roughly seven feet from base to tip.  A ring of bulbs circled the staff at about eye level, and the staff was topped by a curved claw shape. The entire staff was pure black in color.",
            "Vajra's Blackstaff": "[[Vajra Safahr]], the seventh Blackstaff, carried a silver-shod Blackstaff. The Blackstaff she carried when proclaiming her status as the new Blackstaff was the \"true blackstaff\", a large rune-inscribed [[duskwood]] staff with silver veins. The whole staff was blackened by use. Atop the staff was a large axe head in the shape of snarling wolf head, which had glowing green eyes."
        },
        "Known powers": "The Blackstaff had all the powers of a [[staff of power]]. \n\nThe staff also had a [[permanent]] [[blackstaff (spell)]] upon it that could&hellip;\n* &hellip;grant an [[enhancement]] when used in melee combat, \n* &hellip;[[dispel magic]] with a touch,  \n* &hellip;cause a spellcaster to loose a spell or expend a bit of their magical power, and\n* &hellip;channel various [[mind-affecting]] spells. \n\nA Blackstaff's Heir needed to touch the Blackstaff in order to be centered in his or her new powers. Only a Blackstaff or the Blackstaff's Heir could safely carry and wield a Blackstaff. As long as a Blackstaff's Heir was touching the Blackstaff, the powers of the actual Blackstaff (person) could be channeled through the staff."
