        "mainbody": "'''''Reptar's wall''''' was a large, heavy [[magic]]al [[iron]] [[shield]] of unknown origin. It earned its name for its use by the [[ranger]] known as [[Reptar]].",
        "Powers": "This ''+1 shield'' was impervious to rust and corrosion and did not conduct heat or cold, thus protecting its wielder. It was also magically ''[[silence]]d'' and gave no sound when struck, dropped, or otherwise handled.\n\n''Reptar's wall'' possessed two [[command word]]s, both of which were engraved on its inner frame:\n* \"''Eiruvan''\" granted ''[[invisibility]]'' and lent its silencing effects to its wielder. They could not be revealed by most magical means, but lost their concealing effects upon their next attack.\n* \"''Thammis''\" allowed the shieldbearer to ''[[fly]]'' as per the [[spell]] of the same name."
