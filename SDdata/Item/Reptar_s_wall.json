        "mainbody": "Reptars wall was a large, heavy magical iron shield of unknown origin. It earned its name for its use by the ranger known as Reptar.\nThis +1 shield was impervious to rust and corrosion and did not conduct heat or cold, thus protecting its wielder. It was also magically silenced and gave no sound when struck, dropped, or otherwise handled.\nReptars wall possessed two command words, both of which were engraved on its inner frame\n* \"Eiruvan\" granted invisibility and lent its silencing effects to its wielder. They could not be revealed by most magical means, but lost their concealing effects upon their next attack.\n* \"Thammis\" allowed the shieldbearer to fly as per the spell of the same name."
