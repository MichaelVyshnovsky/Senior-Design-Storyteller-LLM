The corruption of nature was a magical device similar to an Eberronnian rune arm, recovered from the Eveningstar War Hospital in the mid-1480s DR.
The corruption of nature could be used to shoot bolts of magical corrosive acid, and further increased the potency of the wielders acid-related spells. It also innately toughened their skin against damage and could help them make quick calculations.
The corruption was found in the Eveningstar War Hospital during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar. The plague spread by the unfortunate red musk zombie Peron Uthe affected the device as well, causing it to carry a weakened, benign, and persistent form of the red musk creeper disease that passed to the wielder and actually benefited them somewhat.
