'''''Jumping''''' was a [[weapon quality|quality]] that could be applied to weapons. When grasped, it acted like a ''[[ring of feather falling]]'', and once every twelve seconds, the wielder could gain the ability to make an extremely powerful jump, with no limit on distance.

==Creation==
To forge a ''jumping'' weapon, a spellcaster must have ''[[jump]]'' and ''[[mage hand]]'' spells available.
