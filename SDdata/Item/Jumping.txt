Jumping was a quality that could be applied to weapons. When grasped, it acted like a ring of feather falling, and once every twelve seconds, the wielder could gain the ability to make an extremely powerful jump, with no limit on distance.
To forge a jumping weapon, a spellcaster must have jump and mage hand spells available.
