A '''topkeg''' was a special [[ale]] [[barrel]] with a separate compartment for holding a small amount of [[rum]].{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|80}}

==Description==
A topkeg looked like a regular ale barrel except for a "crown" or small compartment at the top (the preferred orientation for storage) for the rum. A topkeg held one part rum and fifteen parts ale, which were the desired proportions for making a hot drink called an [[ale flip]]. If filled at the [[Moon Mountain Brewery]], a topkeg contained their light [[Moon Mountain Ale]] and their fiery dark [[Moon Rum]].{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|81}}
