A topkeg was a special ale barrel with a separate compartment for holding a small amount of rum.
A topkeg looked like a regular ale barrel except for a "crown" or small compartment at the top (the preferred orientation for storage) for the rum. A topkeg held one part rum and fifteen parts ale, which were the desired proportions for making a hot drink called an ale flip. If filled at the Moon Mountain Brewery, a topkeg contained their light Moon Mountain Ale and their fiery dark Moon Rum.
