        "mainbody": "Spidersilk jerkins were types of mysterious light armor worn by drow kinslayers in the late 14 century DR.\nSpidersilk jerkins were in reality made using drider silk, rather than spidersilk from a regular giant spider. These armors were rare because of the dangers of procurement of the material, but the resulting light armor was as protective as masterwork studded leather armor while it weighed almost nothing and showed no restrictions to the wearers movements. As such, spellcasters could freely wear spidersilk jerkins without the armor restricting and interfering with their magic.\nIn the , spidersilk jerkins were worn by drow kinslayers who prowled the Neverwinter Wood in search of wood elves and other creatures to slaughter. They were led by priestesses of Lolth."
