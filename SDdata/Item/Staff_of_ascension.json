        "mainbody": "'''''Staves of ascension''''' were [[enchanted]] [[staves]], created to be used by Grand [[Druids]].",
        "Powers": "These staves were imbued with ''+2'' enchantments and magics of nature that granted the boon of ''[[regeneration]]'' to the wielder. Additionally, ''staves of ascension'' allowed the owner to cast the ''[[entangle]]'' spell thrice per day. The nature of these items made it impossible to wield for anyone but a druid.",
        "History": "Each Grand Druid that rose to the highest rank of their druidic circle was granted one of these staves. Each weapon was tailor-made for each individual. Usually, Grand Druids handled high importance global concerns and did not waste their time on mundane daily activities of the circles. Rarely, when Grand Druids were called to action, they wielded ''staves of ascension''. When a Grand Druid died or stepped down from the position, their ''staves of ascension'' were gifted to traveling druids and allies of circles to aid nature around the world.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''staves of ascension'' could be found across the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonsea]] regions."
