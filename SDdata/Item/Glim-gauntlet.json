        "mainbody": "A glim-gauntlet was a variety of enchanted gauntlet, typically worn in the singular rather than as a pair, that was popular in the city of Waterdeep prior to the 14 century DR.\nThese gauntlets were woven from enchanted fibers.\nGlim-gauntlets magically altered their size to fit their wearers. While worn, one allowed the wearer to handle sharp objects, as well as pass their hand through flames and heat, without suffering any harm. But glim-gauntlets were named for their ability to give off a soft, yellow radiance similar to faerie fire upon the wearer issuing a mental command. The intensity of this glow could be brightened or dimmed and there was no limit for how long it could last. Additionally, glim-gauntlets could cause enchanted items touched by them to emit a glow around them, with the strength of that aura corresponding to the power of the items enchantment.\nPrior to the 14 century DR, glim-gauntlets were among some of the most commonly owned magic items in the city of Waterdeep.This is derived from the date given in Cloak & Dagger for the death of Flaern Cragsmere, mentioned in the Undermountain Adventures booklet in this boxed set. they had fallen out of fashion and the methods by which they were made had become forgotten.\n* Jhaniloth Dhree."
