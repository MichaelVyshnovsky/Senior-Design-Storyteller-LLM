A '''toothpick''' was a handy device used to clean the gaps between ones teeth.

==Description==
Made from various hard materials, a toothpick could be a straight [[needle]]-like implement, or [[hook]]ed like a tiny [[gaff]]. Simple wooden slivers would rarely survive use.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Blaerla Roaringhorn]] used a bejeweled toothpick, as befitting her station.
* [[Nix]] had an [[ivory]] toothpick.
* [[Thegger Grynn]] kept a finely-made [[copper]] toothpick in his personal possessions.
