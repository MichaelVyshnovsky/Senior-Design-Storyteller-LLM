An '''''ice box''''' was a [[quasimagical item]] invented in [[Netheril]] to allow people to preserve food by keeping it cool.

==Description==
An ''ice box'' was roughly the shape of a coffin and was constructed from a material with about the same thickness and strength as hardened clay. One weighed about {{SI|300|lb|k|long=yes}}. During the height of the [[Netherese Empire]], they typically sold for 225 [[gp|gold pieces]].

==Abilities==
As a quasimagical item, an ''ice box'' only functioned if within {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} of a ''[[mythallar]]''. If within a ''mythallar's'' range of effect, an ''ice box'' maintained a magical conduit to the [[Paraelemental Plane of Ice]], which provided a constant source of cold to keep food frozen.
