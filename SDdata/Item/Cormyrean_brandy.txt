'''Cormyrean brandy''', also known by its imaginative name â€“ '''Maiden's Kiss''', was a highly valued dark [[brandy]] produced in the Forest Country of [[Cormyr]].

==Availability==
The libation was exported out of Cormyr as early as the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, and available as far as the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]. The [[Weeping Widow Inn]] in Targos had several bottles of the brandy available for its guests.

Cormyrean brandy was considered to be a precious commodity outside Cormyr, especially in the [[Bloodstone Lands]]. [[Jarlaxle]], the [[drow]] leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], carried a bottle in his ''[[pouch of holding]]'' during his stint in the northern regions ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].

Cormyrean brandy was available in the [[Moonsea]] region. However, following the death of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] and the disaster of the [[Dracorage]], its export price skyrocketed.
