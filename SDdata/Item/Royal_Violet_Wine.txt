'''Royal Violet Wine''' was a variety of [[wine]] exported out of the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a shipment of Royal Violet was brought to [[the Vast]] by [[Brandywine Furfoot]], on the behest of [[Jolly Greenleaf]], the proprietor of [[As the Vine Twines]] of the Bluff. Jolly believed that his decade-aged Royal Violet would win the wine-tasting competition, but Brandywine was worried about the low supply of the wine were to win. She sold a bottle for 180 [[gp]] and five gp per glass. Royal Violet Wine was entered into the wine-tasting competition during the year-end celebration of the {{YearlinkName|1371}} in [[Mossbridges]], but it was unknown if it won.
