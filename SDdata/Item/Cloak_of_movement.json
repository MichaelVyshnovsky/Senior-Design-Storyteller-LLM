        "mainbody": "Cloaks of movement were enchanted cloaks that allowed their wearers to move untouched by spiders webs.\nThe magic weaved into cloaks of movement was similar to that of the freedom spell. The wearer was unaffected by spider webs and similar spells.\nThese cloaks were believed to come from the Underdark, created by spider-loving drow. The first surface owner of a cloak of movement was a druid named Golloth. The druid had a special appreciation of spider, studied their precise movement, and meditated on the complex beauty of their webs. Golloths goal in life was protecting giant spiders from the unwitting savagery of well-meaning adventurers, which granted the druid a life of being shunned by civilization. One day, a cloak of movement was gifted to Golloth by a drow ally.\nBy the late 14 century DR, copies of Golloths cloak of movement found their way into mass use and could be found or purchased from merchants in Neverwinter and Elventree, among other cities."
