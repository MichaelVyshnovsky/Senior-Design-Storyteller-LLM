'''Sushi''' was a variety of seafood in the Realms, consisting of freshly raw [[fish]] served with [[rice]], [[seaweed]], and vegetables.

==Availability==
* In [[Kara-Tur]], sushi was popular in [[Kozakura]] and in the [[Hai Yuan Province]] of [[Shou Lung]], whose people had learned it from the Kozakurans.
* In [[Ravens Bluff]], one could find sushi being served at [[Flirin's Sea Morsels]].
