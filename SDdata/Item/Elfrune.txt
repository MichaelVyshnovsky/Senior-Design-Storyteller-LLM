'''''Elfrunes''''' were enchanted tokens that signified friendship.

==Description==
''Elfrunes'' came in a variety of styles including rings, brooches, amulets, etc.

==Powers==
An ''elfrune'' could be used to instantly travel to [[Evermeet]]. They could also be used to communicate with the elven homeland. The magic of these items would only work for the specific person to whom they were gifted.

==History==
Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] gave these tokens to her allies in [[Faer√ªn]]. Both [[Mirt the Moneylender]] and [[Carreigh Macumail]] were known to have possessed an ''elfrune'' at one time.
