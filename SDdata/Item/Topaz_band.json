        "mainbody": "The topaz band was an enchanted ring that increased the wearers defense. It was created in the preâ€“Weeping War Myth Drannor.\nThis masterfully crafted band was created by the dwarves of old Myth Drannor. It was inlaid with multiple shimmering topaz gems, appropriately for its name.\nThe topaz band bore an enchantment that increased the wearers defense, similar to that of a +2 ring of protection.\nIn 1369 DR, the topaz band was discovered by a group of adventurers opposing the Cult of the Dragon in the ruins of the Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor. The magic ring was within one of the chests on the Halls of Light level of the dungeon, guarded by restless undead, in the same room with the stairs to the dungeons lower levels."
