        "mainbody": "The '''''topaz band''''' was an enchanted ring that increased the wearer's defense. It was created in the preâ€“[[Weeping War]] [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "This masterfully crafted band was created by the [[dwarves]] of old Myth Drannor. It was inlaid with multiple shimmering [[topaz]] gems, appropriately for its name.",
        "Powers": "The ''topaz band'' bore an enchantment that increased the wearer's defense, similar to that of a ''+2 [[ring of protection]]''.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the ''topaz band'' was discovered by a group of adventurers opposing the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the ruins of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] of Myth Drannor. The magic ring was within one of the chests on the [[Halls of Light]] level of the dungeon, guarded by restless [[undead]], in the same room with the stairs to the dungeon's lower levels."
