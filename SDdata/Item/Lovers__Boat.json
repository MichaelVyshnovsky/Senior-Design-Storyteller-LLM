        "mainbody": "The Lovers Boat was the original fateful boat that was a vehicle of Galenia and Patrolios young forbidden love, the story that became a popular theatrical troupe staple sometime before 1372 DR.\nThe Lovers Boat appeared to be a simple and well-used rowboat with a round drilled hole in its bottom, corked for safety reasons.\nThe young nobles Galenia and Patrolio lived on two shores of a river that cut through their home city. The two families harbored deep resentment bout each other, but that disapproval did nothing to stop the forbidden romance. The young couple met for the first time in the citys market by chance, which sparked the all-consuming passion. Galenia and Patrolio decided to flee from their hateful families and cemented the plan on the balcony during the Dukes ball. The young man was to arrive by boat under cover of the night via river to Galenias family house where she was to wait for him. However, their plans were doomed. An unknown party, possibly a member of either of the families, overheard the couples plans. The boat had a hole drilled in it by the same nefarious person, and the river waters swallowed young Patrolio. Galenia was left alone to wait for her lover until she died of a broken heart as she perished believing Patrolio betrayed her.\nThis tale became a popular production among bardic troupes of the Sword Coast. The Lovers Boat itself was believed to be taken to the Torleths Treasures, the curio shop in the hamlet of Gillians Hill. Even though the boat was faithfully detailed and even had a cork put into the hole, some believed it was a mere replica."
