'''''Daxiong's Marvelous Magriscope''''' was one of the [[enchanted]] item prototypes created by [[necromancer]] [[Daxiong]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
''Daxiong's Marvelous Magriscope'' resembled a [[magnifying glass]] with a half-inch thick lens and a decorated frame.

==Powers==
''Marvelous Magriscope'' could be used as a ''[[scrying]]'' device and it possessed one-time use magical ability to ''[[identify]]'' enchanted items. This magic worked via arcane magnification that allowed the user to see up close and distinguish the finest runes or codes the revealed the object's origins.

==History==
Daxiong developed these magical devices sometime ''circa'' 1372 DR, as a side project during his obsessive research of zombification rituals. He was ready to gift these items to individuals who provided the necromancer with helpful information for his research. For example, the [[demon]] blood could be used as an arcane adhesive to strengthen zombie joints, staving rot, and decay. Such knowledge was precious to Daxiong.
