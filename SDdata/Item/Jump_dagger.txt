A '''''jump dagger''''' was a seemingly mundane [[dagger]] that possessed three [[magic]]al abilities.{{Cite dragon/169/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A dozen deadly daggers from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}

==Powers==
Upon grasping the blade, it affected the wielder with a constant ''[[feather fall]]''â€“like effect.

The wielder could also, at-will, jump into the air as per the [[spell]] ''[[jump]]''. Doing so would negate the ''feather fall'' effect.

By pointing the dagger, the wielder could also move a certain, small, nonliving object, under 3' in diameter and 100 lbs in weight, up to 30' away.{{Cite dragon/169/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A dozen deadly daggers from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}

==Creation==
One of the crafting methods of a ''jump dagger'' required the use of the spells ''feather fall'', ''jump'', and ''[[levitate]]'' along with a specific method of tempering. The oil used in this process contained the blood of a [[blink dog]] or [[displacer beast]] or the ichor of a [[beholder]].

Another method involved the use of ''jump'' and ''[[mage hand]]'' spells.
