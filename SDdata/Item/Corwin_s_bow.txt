'''''Corwin's bow''''' was the personal [[longbow]] of Captain [[Schael Corwin]], an officer that served in the [[Flaming Fist]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Corwin's bow possessed a ''+1 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' and significantly increased the accuracy with which it could shoot [[arrow]]s.

The bow possessed a unique [[magic]]al boon. About one out of every ten arrows fired by it would splinter open after impact, with each fragment sprouting wooden tendrils that would [[entangle|wrap around the person it struck]].
