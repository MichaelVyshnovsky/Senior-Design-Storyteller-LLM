        "mainbody": "Dwarven plate mail was a special form of plate mail forged for, and wore exlusively by, dwarves.\nDwarven plate mail was thick and cumbersome when compared to regular plate mail or elven variations, but offered more protection to its wearer on a level with full plate armor. It was usually made from black iron. Though smaller in stature when compared to human and elven plate mail, dwarven plate mail often weighed the same because of the extra material used in its construction.\nNorothor, who were specialty priests devoted to Deep Duerra, often wore dwarven plate mail."
