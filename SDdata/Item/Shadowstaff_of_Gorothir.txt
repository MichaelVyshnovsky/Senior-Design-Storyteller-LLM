The Shadowstaff of Gorothir was a holy relic of the church of Shar, a staff granting its wielder powers over shadow magic.
The Shadowstaff made its wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, making it easier to avoid attacks, spells and traps. It did however impose on its wielder severe penalties for standing in bright sunlight or in complete darkness.
The wielder could call on the power of the staff to summon several shadows once per day, or a mighty nightcrawler once a month.
Thrice per day, the wielder could use the staffs magic to turn into a living shadow, gaining benefits similar to that of the gaseous form spell.
The staff could also be used to cast shadow bolts freezing their target to death.
The Shadowstaff was wielded by the high priest Gorothir since the fall of Netheril until his death during the . The staff was shattered shortly after Gorothirs death, but was reformed by Shar as a reward to Lord Vanrak Moonstar circa 1136 DR.
* Gorothir, the original owner of the staff, a high priest of Shar.
