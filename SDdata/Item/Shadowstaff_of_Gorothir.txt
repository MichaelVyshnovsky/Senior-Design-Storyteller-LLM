The '''''Shadowstaff of Gorothir''''' was a holy [[relic]] of the [[church of Shar]], a [[staff]] granting its wielder powers over [[shadow magic]].{{Cite web enhancement/Vanrakdoom|23-24}}

==Powers==
The ''Shadowstaff'' made its wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, making it easier to avoid attacks, spells and traps. It did however impose on its wielder severe penalties for standing in bright [[The sun|sunlight]] or in complete darkness.

The wielder could call on the power of the staff to summon several [[shadow]]s once per day, or a mighty [[nightcrawler]] once a month.

Thrice per day, the wielder could use the staff's magic to turn into a living shadow, gaining benefits similar to that of the ''[[gaseous form]]'' spell.

The staff could also be used to cast ''[[shadow bolt]]s'' freezing their target to death.

==History==
The ''Shadowstaff'' was wielded by the high priest [[Gorothir]] since the [[fall of Netheril]] until his death during the {{YearlinkName|446}}. The staff was shattered shortly after Gorothir's death, but was reformed by [[Shar]] as a reward to Lord [[Vanrak Moonstar]] ''circa'' [[1136 DR]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Gorothir]], the original owner of the staff, a high priest of [[Shar]].
* Lord [[Vanrak Moonstar]], a [[death knight]] of the Dark Lady.
