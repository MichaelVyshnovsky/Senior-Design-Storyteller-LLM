        "mainbody": "Illithid grafts referred to special flesh and body parts that were grafted onto a living creature by illithids (mind flayers).\nThese grafts came in two kinds illithid flesh that was melded onto other creatures, Horribly transformed thralls were a common sight in illithid settlements.\nIllithid grafts were neither magical nor psionic.\nAttaching illithid parts to another creature required familiarity with medicine and specialized knowledge of how to graft flesh. The illithids of Faer√ªns Underdark were known to treat the macabre practice of grafting as an artform,\nIllithid grafting techniques were not related to ceremorphosis.\nSome scholars believed that the illithids were the very first to develop techniques for grafting flesh to another creature, although others argued that they had more likely learned the secrets from a fiend of corruption.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Black Spear tribe of kobolds had struck a pact with the illithids of ChChitl that included \"gifts\" of illithid grafts. By , the kobolds served as scouts in the environs around Waterdeep, and their grafts were inching them closer and closer toward becoming thralls.\nBurrowing claw Both of the thralls hands were replaced with iron-hard claws used for digging.\nExtracting tentacle An arm or forelimb was replaced with a long, flexible tentacle able to pierce flesh and extract brains.\nGrabbing tentacle An arm or forelimb was replaced with a long, flexible tentacle covered in suckers that could be used to grab enemies.\nRaking tentacle An arm or forelimb was replaced with a long, flexible tentacle tipped with a sharp point of bone.\nRending claw The thralls entire arm was replaced with an oversized, muscled limb with razor-sharp claws.\nWeapon graft A weapon was grafted directly into the hand of a thrall.\nBrainmate A  piece of gray matter grown by an elder brain that was implanted at the base of a thralls skull or neck. This graft granted limited access to the elder brains knowledge, and was the rare instance of a graft than an illithid might give itself.\nAntennae graft A pair of tall antennae along with hundreds of short hairs were grafted to the thrall to grant it tremorsense.\nDarksight eyes Pupilless mind flayer eyes granted darkvision. These were reserved for favored thralls.\nGoring horn The thralls entire facial structure was lengthened to accommodate a sharp horn, giving them a bestial appearance.\nGrasping mandibles The thralls jaw and facial muscles were enlarged to accommodate a pair of umber hulk-style mandibles.\nMind blast relay A graft located deep in the thralls brain that allowed illithids to detect their presence and to use them as the origin for their mind blast ability. The graft also conferred immunity to the effects of mind blasts.\nClimbing legs Legs with sticky feet extended to the thralls front, allowing it to climb walls.\nHauling back The thrall was transformed into a quadrupedal beast of burden with an oversized spine and back muscles.\nHumanoid skin A thralls skin was painfully removed and replaced with the flesh and features of another species of a similar build."
