        "mainbody": "'''Illithid grafts''' referred to special flesh and body parts that were [[graft]]ed onto a living creature by illithids ([[mind flayer]]s).",
        "Description": {
            "Creation": "Attaching illithid parts to another creature required familiarity with medicine and specialized knowledge of how to graft flesh. The illithids of [[Faer√ªn]]'s [[Underdark]] were known to treat the macabre practice of grafting as an artform,\n\nIllithid grafting techniques were not related to [[ceremorphosis]]."
        },
        "History": "Some scholars believed that the illithids were the very first to develop techniques for grafting flesh to another creature, although others argued that they had more likely learned the secrets from a [[fiend of corruption]].\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Black Spear]] tribe of [[kobold]]s had struck a pact with the illithids of [[Ch'Chitl]] that included \"gifts\" of illithid grafts. By {{Yearlink|1372}}, the kobolds served as scouts in the environs around [[Waterdeep]], and their grafts were inching them closer and closer toward becoming thralls.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|9-10}}",

                "Grabbing tentacle": "An arm or forelimb was replaced with a long, flexible tentacle covered in suckers that could be used to grab enemies.",
                "Raking tentacle": "An arm or forelimb was replaced with a long, flexible tentacle tipped with a sharp point of bone.",
                "Rending claw": "The thrall's entire arm was replaced with an oversized, muscled limb with razor-sharp claws.",

                "Antennae graft": "A pair of tall antennae along with hundreds of short hairs were grafted to the thrall to grant it [[tremorsense]].",

                "Mind blast relay": "A graft located deep in the thrall's brain that allowed illithids to detect their presence and to use them as the origin for their ''[[mind blast]]'' ability. The graft also conferred immunity to the effects of ''mind blasts''."
