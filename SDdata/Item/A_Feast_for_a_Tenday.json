        "mainbody": "'''A Feast for a Tenday''' was a dish made with [[pork]], [[tomato]]s, and [[vegetable]]s, and it took one's kitchen staff two days to complete.",
        "Description": "The recipe called for a team of cooks and kitchen servants to start preparing the sauce for the dish a day ahead and continue the cooking process on the day of service. The dish called for two [[spoon]]fuls of [[olive oil]], a pack of pork ribs or neck bones, five cloves of [[garlic]], a single [[onion]], a handful of [[mushroom]]s, one and a half pounds of ground [[beef]], a [[cup]] of crushed tomatoes, four large canned tomatoes, a spoon of [[sugar]], [[bay leaves]], [[oregano]], [[salt]], [[pepper]], crushed [[red pepper]], fresh [[basil]] and [[parsley]].\n\nThe cooks were to begin by blowing pork bones on high heat, then continue on frying chopped vegetables and mushrooms together without browning, then adding beef and allowing the mixture to gain color. Following the beef, [[spice]]s, and seasonings joined the medley, followed shortly by tomatoes and pork.\n\nThe sauce then was simmered for most of the afternoon. When done for the day, bones were removed and discarded, meat from the bones was picked and shredded, only to be returned into the sauce and for the sauce to resume simmering the day after. The sauce was served with [[pasta]], hard [[salt]]y [[cheese]], hard-boiled [[egg]]s, and a [[plate]]ful of side [[salad]].",
        "Availability": "The recipe for A Feast for a Tenday could be found in the ''[[Fine at Home: A Cookery Book]]'' found in the noble kitchens of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
