The '''''Heart of Neely''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[gem]] that was presumed to be made out of the heart of a [[nymph]].

==Description==
The item had a hexagonal shape and was blood-red in color.

==Powers==
The ''Heart'' allowed its user to cast ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' at the cost of three of its charges. As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, nine charges were available.

==History==
When the [[Battle of the Bridge]] was fought in the [[High Forest]], a nymph named [[Neely (nymph)|Neely]] fell in love with a [[warrior]]. When the soldier was wounded during the battle, the nymph came to him, pulled her heart out from her chest, and then placed it upon his hand. The heart changed into a gem, and Neely disappeared, never to be heard or seen again by her beloved. The warrior kept the gem as treasure, passed down through generations of his family.

As of [[1372]] [[DR]], the ''Heart of Neely'' was in the possession of the [[priest]] named [[Gilford]], who made it available to buy from his shop in the village of [[Hilltop]] in the [[Silver Marches]].
