'''''Sparking bolts''''' were [[enchanted]] [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s imbued with lightning magics.

==Powers==
These bolts appeared quite ordinary apart from cracking with electric energy when touched. When ''sparking bolts'' were shot from a crossbow, they leaped towards the target like a bolt of lightning, leaving the smell of ozone and [[sulfur]] in its trail. Once such a bolt struck, it released its lightning magics into the wound.

==History==
''Sparking bolts'' were widely used by the [[goblin]]s of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] that besieged [[Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}.
