        "Description": "These capes were dyed in brilliant red color and decorated with shimmering embroidered flames.",
        "Powers": "''Capes of the fire bath'' shielded their wearers from extreme heat, magical flames of spells, and even fiery [[dragon breath]]. Additionally, these cloaks improved the wearers' reaction and defenses against physical and magical threats.",
        "History": "These items were created for the use of influential [[cleric]]s and worshipers of Kossuth, however, by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these flaming capes entered a wide rotation among spellcasters of the Realms. In [[1372 DR]], these capes could be purchased from the [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]] of Daggerford."
