        "mainbody": "Capes of the fire bath were common enchanted cloaks worn by worshipers of Kossuth.\nThese capes were dyed in brilliant red color and decorated with shimmering embroidered flames.\nCapes of the fire bath shielded their wearers from extreme heat, magical flames of spells, and even fiery dragon breath. Additionally, these cloaks improved the wearers reaction and defenses against physical and magical threats.\nThese items were created for the use of influential clerics and worshipers of Kossuth, however, by the late 14 century DR, these flaming capes entered a wide rotation among spellcasters of the Realms. In 1372 DR, these capes could be purchased from the Sorcellers Encapsulate of Daggerford."
