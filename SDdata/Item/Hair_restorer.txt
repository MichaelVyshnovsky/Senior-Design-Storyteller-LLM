'''Hair restorer''' was an [[alchemical]] substance.

==Powers==
It caused hair growth locally if applied as a salve. It could also be drunk to cause hair to sprout from all areas that could sprout it. The treatment had to be repeated monthly to overcome baldness; a reversed version existed, which caused hair to fall off instead.

==History==
The substance was very challenging to synthesize,{{Cite dragon/163/Hedge Wizards|24}} requiring a combination of very advanced alchemical and herbal skills; [[hedge wizard]]s often traded in it. It sold for about 250 [[gold pieces]].
