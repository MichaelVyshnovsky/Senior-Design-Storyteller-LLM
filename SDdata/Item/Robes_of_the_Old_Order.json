        "mainbody": "The robes of the Old Order and improved robes of the Old Order were sets of enchanted monks robes produced by the Old Order.\nEarly robes were light brown with large shoulder pads, while the improved version was dark brown. Later robes reversed this color scheme, and came with white and tan mantlets, respectively, both with red belts.\nThese resilient robes could absorb some of the damage done by mundane and minor magical weapons. The improved version also provided protection like armor.\nThe monks of the Old Order manufactured these robes to fund their monasteries. These enabled monks of many faiths and orders to survive battles against foes in traditional armor. They were found on the Sword Coast North around 1372 DR."
