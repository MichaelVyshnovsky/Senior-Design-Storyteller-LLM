'''Saldruth's viper venom''' was a [[poison]] extracted from the fangs of the [[Saldruth's viper]], a [[snake]] found in the [[Nelanther Isles]]. It was harvested by [[pirate]]s and sold to merchants in [[Skullport]] and [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
This viscous, white liquid tasted slightly sweet. It could be mixed with water or alcohol and ingested, or applied to a weapon and introduced into the bloodstream by injury. A single dose typically cost 300 gp.

==Effects==
Unless the victim was able to resist, this poison initially sapped a victims health and eventually damaged their constitution.

==Notable Users==
[[Elsk Thavarask]], the proprietor of the [[Missing Minotaur]] tavern in [[Everlund]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], was known to use this substance to subdue excessively rowdy customers on occasion. He was also known to sell it to people he trusted.
