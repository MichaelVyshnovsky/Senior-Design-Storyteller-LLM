Whip sashes were special weapons used by Holy slayer assassins in Zakhara.
Outwardly, these weapons appeared as regular silk sashes. Underneath the silk rested a leather sash that had metal wire with a steel tip.
These weapon were used in a similar manner to that of a horsewhip or a garrote. 
* Whip sashes were a favored weapon among Moon-spinners.
