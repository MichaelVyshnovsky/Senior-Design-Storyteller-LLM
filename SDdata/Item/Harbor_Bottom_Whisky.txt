Harbor Bottom Whisky was a type of cheap whiskey commonly found in taverns of Daggerford such as the Black Stone Inn and Happy Cow.
This potent rot-gut whiskey was notoriously foul-tasting. Its flavor palate was often described as something found deep in the muck of a seafloor. However, its extreme potency and cheap price made it popular with sailors of Daggerford around 1372 DR.
