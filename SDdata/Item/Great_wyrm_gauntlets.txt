The great wyrm gauntlets were a pair of unique enchanted gauntlets created by a dragon disciple named Redshadow sometime before 1374 DR.
The great wyrm gauntlets possessed powerful +6 enchantments that made every punch a deadly danger and guided the wearers fists toward their desired target. Additionally, each punch blazed with the fire that burned the target. However, the gauntlets magic came at a price of significantly reduced dexterity.
These legendary gauntlets were stitched together out of a great wyrms hide by a dragon disciple only known as Redshadow, many years before the late 14 century DR. Some stories claimed that the dragon disciple was the great wyrms child. Sages agreed that the fearsome battle between the two took place in the skies over the Dragonsfire Mountains. Redshadow wore the great wyrm gauntlets until her death, after which the magic items disappeared from history for a long while.
In of the , the great wyrm gauntlets were sold by a drow merchant who did business in the Undergate, Westgates unsavory underbelly.
