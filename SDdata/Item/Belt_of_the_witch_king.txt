Note that the item backstory provided in ''[[Adventurer's Vault 2]]'' is different, and is non-canon for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

==Description==
The ''belt'' was a series of small [[obsidian]] spheres charged with [[arcane]] power, which were each connected to the next by a small [[silver]] link of [[chain]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|32}}

==Powers==
The ''belt'' fortified the wearer's endurance. If its wearer was an arcane spellcaster, it could leverage their [[magical]] power to heal them if they became seriously injured.
