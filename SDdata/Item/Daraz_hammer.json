        "Description": "These [[light hammer]]s were decorated with runes that announced Clan Daraz as the weapons' makers.",
        "Powers": "Created to be wielded against [[goblinoid]] foes, ''Daraz hammers'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and dealt small about of sonic damage with every swing. Additionally, when wielded against [[goblin]]s and their kin, ''Daraz hammers'' became twice as effective.",
        "History": "''Daraz hammers'' were created ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|872}} en masse to arm Daraz clansfolk against the encroaching horde of [[orc]]s and goblins. However, these weapons nor the power and will of dwarven defenders were enough to save Clan Daraz from being extinguished by the horde. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Daraz hammers'' could be found virtually anywhere in [[Faer√ªn]], including the city of [[Neverwinter]]. One of such hammers belonged to the [[Hall of Justice]], the temple dedicated to [[Tyr]] in Neverwinter."
