Additionally, when wielded against goblins and their kin, Daraz hammers became twice as effective.\nDaraz hammers were created circa the  en masse to arm Daraz clansfolk against the encroaching horde of orcs and goblins. However, these weapons nor the power and will of dwarven defenders were enough to save Clan Daraz from being extinguished by the horde. By the late 14 century DR, Daraz hammers could be found virtually anywhere in Faer√ªn, including the city of Neverwinter. One of such hammers belonged to the Hall of Justice, the temple dedicated to Tyr in Neverwinter."
