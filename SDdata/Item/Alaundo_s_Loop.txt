'''Alaundo's Loop''' was a mysterious [[magical item]] apparently associated with the great prophet [[Alaundo|Alaundo the Seer]].

==Description==
It took the form of a golden crystal shaped like a twisted curl that was constantly turning in on itself.

==History==
By [[1374 DR]], Alaundo's Loop was in the possession of [[Khelben Arunsun]] and kept within [[Blackstaff Tower]], where it rested on a white velvet cushion on display between the ground and second floors.

==Powers==
Deep inside, it was said to conceal eternity itself.
