Alaundos Loop was a mysterious magical item apparently associated with the great prophet Alaundo the Seer.
It took the form of a golden crystal shaped like a twisted curl that was constantly turning in on itself.
By 1374 DR, Alaundos Loop was in the possession of Khelben Arunsun and kept within Blackstaff Tower, where it rested on a white velvet cushion on display between the ground and second floors.
Deep inside, it was said to conceal eternity itself.
