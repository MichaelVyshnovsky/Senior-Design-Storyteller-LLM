'''Jerky''' was a type of common dry [[ration]]s, usually made of [[beef]], [[venison]] or [[caribou]], often carried by [[human]] adventurers due to its lightweight and longevity.

==Description==
Jerky was hard and had very little flavor. When jerky and [[hard-tack]] were consumed, a large amount of water needed to be consumed as a  part of the meal, to aid digestions of these foods.

==Availability==
*In the [[Moonsea]] region, [[rabbit]] meat jerky was a commonly encountered type of provisions.
*In [[Sembia]], jerky was [[pepper]]ed, to give it more patentable taste.
*In ancient [[Myth Drannor]], tack and jerky were stored in some of the tombs in the [[Polyandrium]], including [[Lyssic's Crypt]].

==History==
Jerky was created and consumed as far back as the Empire of [[Netheril]], carried in [[oilskin]] pouches.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Artus Cimber]] carried jerky rations during his adventurers in [[Chult]] ''circa'' [[1362 DR]].
*[[Jack Ravenwild]] often stock up on non-perishable foods, like tack, dried [[sausage]], [[cheese]]s, and jerky, in case he needed to lay low for several days.
*[[Maimun]] fed on jerky and dried fruit while a stowaway onboard the ''[[Sea Sprite]]''.
*[[Martine]], a [[Harper]] [[ranger]] who stocked up on all the adventuring necessities in [[Shadowdale]] in [[1366 DR]].
*[[Shal Desanea]], [[Tarl Desanea]], and [[Ren o' the Blade]] consumed jerky as part of their ration ''circa'' [[1340 DR]].
*[[Shaleen]], one of the wives of [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]], who befriended a [[kobold]] by coaxing him off a tree with a piece of jerky during her and the Open Lord's first meeting.
