Greatshout as a Young Man was a famous, expensive, and unique painting that depicted Duke Pwyll Daggerford in his youth. 
Greatshout as a Young Man was commissioned as a celebration of Pwyll Daggerfords twenty fifth birthday. At some point after that it was stolen from the ducal vaults.
By 1372 DR, this painting was already a collectors item that could score a hefty price. The painting was hidden securely under the curio shop, Torleths Treasures in Gillians Hill. The paintings owner, Torleth Mindulspeer, kept his under lock and key, protected by iron bars and traps. The security was heightened after the paintings price skyrocketed following the Dukes resumed death in a hunting accident in 1372 DR. Torleths bitter rival from Daggerford, Vladmyr, wanted to get his hands on the pricy piece of art and use it to humiliate the paintings owner in the process.
The opportunity to do just that presented itself when Davey Hallorans father found himself in a deep gambling debt to Vladmyr the Moneylender. When the Hero of Daggerford decided to help the down-on-his-luck commoner, Vladmyr offered debt forgiveness in exchange for the Greatshout as a Young Man. The moneylender wanted the painting stolen and replaced with a masterfully crafted fake. When the deed was done, the rare depiction of Duke Daggerford in his youth was in Vladmyrs possession, and Torleth Mindulspeer was humiliated during an auction that was held shortly after.
