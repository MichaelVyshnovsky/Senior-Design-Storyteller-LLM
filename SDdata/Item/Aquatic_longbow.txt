'''Aquatic longbows''' were an underwater version of the [[longbow]] used by [[aquatic elf|aquatic elves]].

==Description==
The aquatic longbow could be used normally above water, achieving effective ranges similar to surface [[shortbow]]s. When used with [[sea arrow]]s underwater, the aquatic longbow did not suffer from a loss of accuracy and power over short distances, allowing the user to perform long-range shots. These bows used a special [[kelp]] bowstring that dampened the turbulence of launching. Mighty composite versions of the aquatic longbow ranged from 600 gp to 900 gp.
