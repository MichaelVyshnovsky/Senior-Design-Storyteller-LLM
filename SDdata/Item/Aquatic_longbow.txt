Aquatic longbows were an underwater version of the longbow used by aquatic elves.
The aquatic longbow could be used normally above water, achieving effective ranges similar to surface shortbows. When used with sea arrows underwater, the aquatic longbow did not suffer from a loss of accuracy and power over short distances, allowing the user to perform long-range shots. These bows used a special kelp bowstring that dampened the turbulence of launching. Mighty composite versions of the aquatic longbow ranged from 600 gp to 900 gp.
