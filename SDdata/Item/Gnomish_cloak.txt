'''Gnomish cloaks''' were special cloaks worn by some [[rogue]]s.

==Description==
These wonderful cloaks were expertly crafted with grey fabrics that created a textured look, allowing a prowling thief to blend into the shadows with more conviction.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold standard gnomish cloaks for 10 [[gold piece]]s, as well as ones big enough to completely cover a large individual for 12 gp. The catalogue noted that, while they were not nearly as grand as ''[[Cloak of elvenkind|cloaks of elvenkind]]'', gnomish cloaks made a find addition to any rogue's wardrobe.
