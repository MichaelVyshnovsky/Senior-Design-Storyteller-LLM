''Brooches of safety'' were enchanted pieces of jewelry from [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
A small intricately decorated brooch, a ''brooch of safety'' was shaped to resemble a [[shield]] and had a glowing purple [[gem]]stone affixed to its center.

==Powers==
These enchanted brooches gave the wearer a chance of becoming invisible as if under the effects of the ''[[sanctuary]]'' spell, allowing them to avoid being targeted by a foe for a short period of time.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Halbenet Soladonel]]: a [[moon elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
