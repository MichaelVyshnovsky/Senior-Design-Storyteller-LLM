        "mainbody": "A lateen was a style of sail used on various ships across Faerûn and Zakhara. Some Zakharans mistakenly believed that this style of sail was unique to ships in the Land of Fate and not found anywhere else on Toril.In the book Golden Voyages, it is stated that lateens are \"a style not used in the northern or eastern lands\". These lands most likely refer to Faerûn and Kara-Tur respectively. However, instances of lateen sails in Faerûn can be found in numerous other sources both prior to and following this books publication. This could be interpreted as a case of in-universe misinformation, with Zakharans having little exposure to or knowledge of the many Faerûnian ships that do sport lateen sails. Ships that sported a lateen sail were referred to as \"lateen-rigged\".\nUnlike most sails in Faerûn, which took on a rectangular shape,Golden Voyages describes lateens or at least a variant of lateen as not being true triangles, but as having a corner cut off. This would instead refer to what is known as a  settee sail This shape allowed lateens to remain effective at sizes larger than rectangular sails and enabled ships to sail more windward.\nIn the city of Waterdeep, the Most Diligent League of Sail-makers and Cordwainers sold lateen sails of \"standard\" dimensions for around 500 to 700 gold pieces, though could lower those prices by thirty percent if several months notice were given. Some Waterdhavians unaffiliated with the guild sold sails for as low as 200 gold pieces, though they carried no guarantees.\nThe existence of lateens on Toril dated as far back as the Netherese Empire, where they saw some use on small caravels used to sail the Narrow Sea.\n* The Gleason, a galleass belonging to the Dhostars, was outfitted with lateen sails.\n* Queen of the Night, a merchant galley belonging to the Zhentarim, had two lateen-rigged masts.\n* Sea Sprite, a caravel captained by Deudermont, was outfitted with three lateen-rigged masts.\n* Wail of the Banshee, a unique galleon style necromancer ship, had two lateen-rigged masts.\n* Wave Wyvern, a galleass belonging to Grand Duke Farnig Seasilver, had three lateen-rigged masts.\n* The City Navy of Waterdeep had over twenty small galleys sporting lateen sails.\n* Amnian caravels were typically outfitted with lateen sails.\n* In the city of Marsember, both civilians and soldiers used canvas covers on their skiffs as makeshift lateen sails.\n* The people of Lantan were widely known for their lateen-rigged ships.\n* Battle dolphins, a type of spelljammer, were outfitted with a lateen sail on their forward deck.\n* Coastboats, a type of vessel used throughout Aglarond to sail along its coast and many rivers, were typically outfitted with lateen sails.\n* Feluccas, a type of twin-masted vessel used by fisherfolk in Rashemen, was typically lateen-rigged.\n* Folding boats commonly sported a lateen sail.\n* Galleasses.\n* Gigs, a type of sail boat found in Calimshan, were typically outfitted with lateen sails.\n* In Zakhara, lateen sails were commonly used on dhows, such as barijahs, baghlas, and sambuks. Beyond dhows, qaribs were sometimes outfitted with lateens and achieved faster speeds with such rigging.\nThe Sea Devils EyeThe Rose of SarifalThe ReaverThe Sentinel\n* \nCategoryItems\nCategoryItems from Aglarond\nCategoryItems from Rashemen\nCategoryItems from the Unapproachable East\nCategoryItems from Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Calimshan\nCategoryItems from West Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Waterdeep\nCategoryItems from Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Netheril\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Zakhara\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategory500-599 gold pieces\nCategory600-799 gold pieces\n4ubnxwubgxxzwgk2px7mh9ww9xmpxhc"
