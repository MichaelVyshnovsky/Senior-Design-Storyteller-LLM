        "Description": "Unlike most sails in Faerûn, which took on a rectangular shape,''Golden Voyages'' describes lateens or at least a variant of lateen as not being true triangles, but as having a corner cut off. This would instead refer to what is known as a  [[wikipedia:settee (sail)|settee sail]] This shape allowed lateens to remain effective at sizes larger than rectangular sails and enabled ships to sail more windward.",
        "Availability": "In the city of [[Waterdeep]], the [[Most Diligent League of Sail-makers and Cordwainers]] sold lateen sails of \"standard\" dimensions for around 500 to 700 [[gold piece]]s, though could lower those prices by thirty percent if several months' notice were given. Some Waterdhavians unaffiliated with the guild sold sails for as low as 200 gold pieces, though they carried no guarantees.<ref>",
        "History": "The existence of lateens on Toril dated as far back as the [[Netherese Empire]], where they saw some use on small [[caravel]]s used to sail the [[Narrow Sea]].<ref>",
