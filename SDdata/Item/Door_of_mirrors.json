        "mainbody": "A '''''door of mirrors''''' was a door that sporadically effected those that passed through it's arch in a number of ways. At first it would summon a few exact mirror copies of the person or creature that duplicated their every move for 2-7 minutes. After this time, the mirror copies would merge back with the target, electrocuting and [[confusion|confusing]] them.\n\nThese doors were often created so that they would only sporadically trigger, such as once per day, every fourth creature passing through or by random chance",
        "Creation": "''Doors of mirrors'' were crafted using the [[spell]]s ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[shocking grasp]]'' and ''confusion''."
