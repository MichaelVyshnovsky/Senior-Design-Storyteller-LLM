At first it would summon a few exact mirror copies of the person or creature that duplicated their every move for 2-7 minutes. After this time, the mirror copies would merge back with the target, electrocuting and confusing them.\nThese doors were often created so that they would only sporadically trigger, such as once per day, every fourth creature passing through or by random chance\nDoors of mirrors were crafted using the spells mirror image, shocking grasp and confusion."
