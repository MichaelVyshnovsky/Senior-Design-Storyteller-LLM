A '''''dagger of venom''''' was a common magic blade with the power to [[poison]].

==Description==
''Daggers of venom'' were black [[dagger]]s with serrated edges. If viewed by one able to ''[[detect magic]]'', they glowed with a faint [[Necromancy|necromantic]] aura. Some ''daggers of venom'' were carved out of [[green dragon]] horns.

In [[Zakhara]], ''[[jambiya]]s of venom'' and ''[[katar]]s of venom'' were also common&mdash;as well as other magically venomous dagger-like weapons.{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate|68,73}}

''Daggers of venom'' typically sold for over 8,000 [[gold piece]]s.

==Abilities==
In addition to being a mildly magical blade, once per day, the bearer of this blade could will the magic of the dagger to poison its victim, as if the ''[[Poison (spell)|poison]]'' spell had been cast. The attacker could make this choice either before or after striking, but it must have been within a few seconds of the wound in either case.

Another variant of the ''dagger of venom'' possessed a somewhat more lingering power: once activated once a day, it remained coated in black poison for about one minute.

==Creation==
[[Darkmask]]s, specialty [[priest]]s of the [[drow]] god [[Vhaeraun]], often crafted ''daggers of venom''. Such blades required two black [[star sapphire]]s and either [[adamantine]] or [[mithral]] as the metal. A crafter must have been able to invoke the ''poison'' spell.
