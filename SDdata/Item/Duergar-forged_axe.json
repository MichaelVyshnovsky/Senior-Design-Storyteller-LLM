        "mainbody": "Duergar-Forged Axes were huge perfectly-balanced enchanted battle axes of dull gray steel, forged and ensorcelled by the duergar dwarves underneath the Spine of the World.\nThe sharpness of these dangerous axes was evident that the duergar smiths used magic in their creation. Duergar-forged axes possessed +1 enchantments to the weapons aim and damage, while their keen blades were ready to cleave the opponents.\nIn , one such ax belonged to Barud Barzam, a duergar leader who was in charge of an underground outpost in the River Caves, where the Black Raven River spills from under the Spine of the World. Barud offered his duergar-forged axe to anyone willing to descend into the lower caverns underneath the outpost to exterminate hook horrors and mustard jellies who infested the area."
