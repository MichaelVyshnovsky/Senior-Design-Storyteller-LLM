        "mainbody": "'''''Ashram''''' was an ancient [[magic]]al ''+2 [[bronze]] [[scimitar]]'' that possessed the essence of an unknown [[spirit]]. It was forged by the [[church of Anhur]] centuries before [[Dale reckoning]] and had changed hands among several warriors and champions throughout the years.{{Cite dragon/277/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Soargar's Legacy|87}}",
        "Description": "Although the scimitar ''Ashram'' was forged from bronze, it exhibited the strength of that made from the finest [[steel]]. Its grip was wrapped in strips of [[fire lizard]] hide and its pommel was shaped into a claw clutching a [[gem]] that appeared as flickering flame. While some [[sage]]s believed the stone housed a sliver of a [[fire elemental]], it was actually the spirit of a creature that has yet to be identified. If it were ever released from the blade, another spirit would replace it after 24 days.",
        "Powers": "The ''+2 scimitar'' allowed the wielder to strike quickly in battle and, upon scoring any particularly damaging attack, would let loose a burst of flame upon its target. The spirit that resided within the gem of the pommel prevented the sword from being destroyed and protected the blade's wielder from suffering any damage from fire, heat, or electricity.",
        "History": "The scimitar known as ''Ashram'' was forged some time before {{Yearlink|-1000}} by [[priest]]s of the deity [[Anhur]] for [[Senusret]], the champion of the armies of [[Mulhorand]]. He wielded the blade valiantly during the [[Orcgate Wars]], and upon his death, it passed to other generals of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|God Kings]] for generations. When the nation was invaded by [[Narfell]] in a seaborne invasion in [[623 DR]], the blade fell into the hands of an unnamed Narfelli warrior, who carried it with him until his death, and burial within the [[Great Dale]].\n\nSome time later, the blade appeared in the vast collection of [[Thorodil|King Thorodil]] of [[Impiltur]], and was specifically known for being wielded by [[Calthos|Duke Calthos]] of [[House Orbil]]. Around 50 years later, when the minor noble house fell into disfavor, the blade returned to the king's armory but was seldom, if ever, used by the royal family. It remained in the royal vaults of Impiltur until it was gathered by the royal mage [[Soargar]], along with many other [[sword]]s, and taken to his tower in the city of  [[Lyrabar]].\n\nUnfortunately the king went missing and the sword went with him. Some 60 years later it was recovered by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Sarros]], during an expedition into the Giantspires to recover the [[Watch Crystal of Alathas]]. Sarros presented the treasured blade to the [[Zulkir]] of [[divination]], [[Elzarr]] of the [[Crimson Eye]]. After adding some addition [[item enchantment|enchantments]] to the sword, the Red Wizards presented it to the [[Biting Blade of Thay]], the martial instructor to the nation's agents known as [[The Hands (Thay)|the Hands]], [[Daryn Mellas]].\n\nThe sword was wielded for at least 30 years by the warrior [[Thoroun]], a senior member of the Hands, who operated primarily in the [[Inner Sea]] region to further the cause of the Red Wizards of [[Thay]]."
