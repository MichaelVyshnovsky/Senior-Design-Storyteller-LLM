She survived but was left with a weak constitution and difficulties standing and walking. Her father, [[Adam Smith]] of the [[Iron Bull Smithy]], built for her a wheeled chair so she could move around home, shop, and school, as well as a wheelbarrow so she could be transported through the city. With a talent for [[mathematics]], by the age of 12 she was helping in the family business, keeping track of accounting.{{Cite polyhedron/103/The Living City: The Horse Businesses|11,12-13}}\n* Lady [[Nettel Thalavar]]: The elderly matriarch of the [[Thalavar]] family of [[Westdate]], she employed a wheeled chair pushed by six [[halfling]] retainers around [[1368 DR]]. It was equipped with an awning, was painted white, and had the family's green feather painted on side panels. She left the chair when needed to walk short distances, such as up a ship's gangplank.\n* [[Sarmon|Sarmon the Spectacular]]: A [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]], he was magically aged by a [[ghazneth]] in [[1371 DR]], leaving him frail.

She eventually relented and accepted a palanquin.\n* [[Lucas Rivenstave]]: An ill old man and one of the Seven Burghers of [[New Velar]] in [[Harrowdale]] around [[1479 DR]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Vesperin Initiative|10,44}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Agony|18,46}}\n* [[Jaan'vald Llanou]], a [[githzerai]] and member of the [[Sha'sal Khou]], in the late 1400s DR.
