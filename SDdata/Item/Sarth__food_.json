        "mainbody": "Sarth was the Khôltan name for ox and horse meat served on a skewer, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis dish was available in Khôltar, the Iron City, at various establishments, but most notably from Taurgaurs Tarjteir, an inn and luthdren (restaurant) that catered to dwarves. The meats were cut into cubes and marinated in various strong-flavored sauces for about a month. Skewers were stacked with alternating pieces of horse and ox meat from different vats, broiled, and served."
