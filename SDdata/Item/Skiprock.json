        "mainbody": "'''Skiprocks''' were specially made, polished stone projectiles invented by [[halfling]] weaponsmiths",
        "Weaponology": "Skiprocks were finely weighted and shaped to ensure they were perfect for throwing. If thrown well enough, after hitting a target they would typically ricochet and hit another.\n\nBesides their use as pure projectiles, skiprocks were known to be used as [[bullet]]s for [[slings]] or the heavy [[warsling]]. However, when shot from a sling they typically did not ricochet.",
        "Notable Users of Slingrocks": "Skiprocks were primarily wielded by halflings, They were also a standard weapon in the arsenal of any [[warsling sniper]]."
