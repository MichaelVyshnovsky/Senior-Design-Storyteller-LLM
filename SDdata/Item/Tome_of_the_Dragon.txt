The '''''Tome of the Dragon''''' was a tome written by [[Sammaster]] and completed in [[905 DR]]. It contained all of Sammaster's theories, experiments, and conclusions in his efforts to turn [[dragon]]s into [[dracolich]]es and was a basis for the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Description==
[[File:Cult of the Dragon.jpg|thumb|right|The symbol of the Cult of the Dragon, which formed the clasp for the book.]]
The book measured 35 cm (14 in) by 25 cm (10 in) and was 15 cm (6 in) deep. It had a clasp in the form of the symbol for the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. The only adornment on its cover was a gilded gold version of the Cult of the Dragon's symbol. Its cover radiated [[magic]] and a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell was needed to safely handle it for a limited time.

==Defenses==
Touching the book without proper precautions would lead to a dragon breath effect that emanated from it, but would never damage the book itself. This breath effect could vary, and included the breath effects of [[black dragon]]s, [[blue dragon]]s, [[green dragon]]s, [[red dragon]]s, or [[white dragon]]s. One of the pages also contained an invisible enchantment that, when activated, would cause damage to the wielder, but would imbue him or her with the ability to use a dragon breath effect, and another page of this type that allowed the wielder to use ''[[teleport without error]]'' to a random location, leaving the book behind.

==Text==
The words in the book were written in a magical cipher that could not be understood even with ''[[comprehend languages]]'', but this cipher was known by wizards in the Cult of the Dragon.

==Copies==
Many copies of the original book were made by Cult of the Dragon members. The original book was almost indestructible (rumored by the [[Harpers]] to be damaged only by ''[[silver fire]]''), but the same did not hold true for copies. There were also known to be many corrupt copies in existence. Copies of the ''Tome of the Dragon'' even turned up in the possession of Penultima cultists on the far-off world of [[Adenthia]], which were given to them by a resurrected Sammaster himself.<ref>

==Quotes==
{{Quote|Benevolence is the best mask for manipulation. Those who have power are sluggards and wastrels if they use it not, but are wisest if they learn many ways to achieve their ends. There is a time for the ravening assault and a time for deft misdirection. And then there are grimmer occasions when one lacks even the time to choose how to proceed. These are best kept rare.|Sammaster the Mad, ''Tome of the Dragon''}}
{{Quote|Mages are superior to other mortals for they alone have felt, raw and unfettered by the guiding hands of deities, the power that moves and gives life to all things. It is right that wizards rule.|Sammaster the Mad, ''Tome of the Dragon''}}
