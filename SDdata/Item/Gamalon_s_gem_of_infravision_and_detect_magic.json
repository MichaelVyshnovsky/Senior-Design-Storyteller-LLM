        "Description": "''Gamalon's gem'' was a large ersatz eye carved out of [[emerald]].",
        "Powers": "The gem eye had as a permanent ''[[infravision]]'' [[spell]] active, allowing [[Gamalon Idogyr]], its owner, to see even in the deepest darkness of the [[Underdark]]. Additionally, ''Gamalon's gem'' had a permanent ''[[detect magic]]'' spell weaved into its enchantments.",
        "History": "Gamalon Idogyr lost his left eye at a relatively young age and had it replaced with a unique emerald – a ''gem of infravision and detect magic''. Since then, Gamalon had been weeping the green gem in his left eye socket at all times, not only for its magical properties but also for the appearances – ''Gamalon's gem'' made the [[mage]] memorable and fearsome."
