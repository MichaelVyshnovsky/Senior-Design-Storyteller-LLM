Netherpelters were a kind of magical Netherese missile weapon similar to a blowgun that worked with magical or mundane ammunition.Despite the reference to a blowgun, it is unclear if the netherpelter actually resembled a blowgun or some other device, and if it was propelled by breath, bowstring, or pure magical force.
Netherpelters could be loaded with normal darts or pellets, and would massively improve the speed, range, and power of the projectile. Special bespoke pellets were intended to be used with the netherpelter, however, with each type having a powerful magical effect.
 Blackhole
The first creature or object struck by the blackhole pellet was trapped indefinitely inside of it. While trapped, they were kept under an effect similar to temporal stasis or imprisonment. The imprisoned target could be freed by use of Chronomancers time stop.
 Blowhole
The pellet would impact and pierce into the target as a normal projectile, then expand in size tenfold, violently rupturing the flesh.
 Decay
The target struck by the decay pellet would immediately begin to rot, rust, and otherwise decompose over a few minutes. The inexorable doom could be halted by a powerful dispel magic or cure disease spell.
 Firepit
The pellet detonated on impact, imitating a powerful Noanars fireball explosion.
 Waterpelt
The pellet transformed into a large jet or tentacle of water on being launched, slamming the target with crushing force as if by the punch of a water elemental.
 Windwhip
The windwhip pellet would forcibly ground a flying target, as if an air elemental had grabbed it and pulled it down.
