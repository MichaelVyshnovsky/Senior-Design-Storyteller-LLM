        "mainbody": "'''Sugar''' was one of the major sweeteners consumed across the [[Realms]] and created using several types of plants.",
        "Availability": "In the days of the ancient [[Netheril]], [[sugar maple]] trees were used to produce sugar, a technique learned from the [[elves]]. The maple-sugaring season took place in winter and it filled the forests with a sweet tangy aroma. [[Sugar cane]] was used in production of sugar in the [[Calim Empire]] as well as in the nations of [[Kara-Tur]], including the islands of [[Wa]], where it was created via boiling it into raw sugar or candy.\n\nSugar extracted from [[sugar beet]]s was a common sweetener used in the [[Interior Faerûn]], some of which was produced in [[Berdusk]].",
        "Usages": "The Netherese made a snack food of sugared [[date]]s.\n\nIn the Calim Empire and later in [[Calimshan]], cane sugar was used in marinating [[frog]]s' legs, and sweetening [[mint tea]].\n\nIn the [[Central Faerûn]], [[Suzail]]'s nobles were known to have platters of breaded and fried, sugar-dusted soft-shelled [[crabs]] served to their guests, sugar-nuts were served as a snack, and tea was served alongside sugar pressed into small cubes. [[Sembia]] and its capital city of [[Selgaunt]] were known for its sugar-ice street vendors, beloved by children. And following introduction of [[cocoa]] from [[Maztica]], the [[Great Mother's House]] in Berdusk began making [[chocolate fudge]], sweetened with sugar.\n\nCormyr's cubbed sugar was a product of [[Amn]], which, in turn, was stolen from Maztica following its colonization. Amnite sugar cubes were a popular and expensive novelty until [[House Dhostar]] imported an especially large quantities of sugar from Maztica, lowering its price dramatically in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.\n\nSugar received wide use in the [[Shining South]]. People of [[Halruaa]] consumed much sugared [[wine]], popular even among youths, sugared pastries, and a street food called the [[Hangman's noose]] was generously dusted with finely ground sugar, [[allspice]], [[cardamom]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], and sugared [[fig]]s and other fruits were a common snack food.\n\nIn the [[Border Kingdoms]] and in the city of [[Oeble]], milk tea was sweetened with sugar.\n\nThe [[Utter East]], folk liked fanciful mixed drinks, generously doctored with [[dye]]s and sugar-powder. They often were prepared and dispensed from bars in establishments like [[Donder's Dancing Masques]] in [[Tharkar]] of the [[Free Cities of Parsanic]].\n\nOn the [[Moonshae Isles]], cakes were decorated with delicate [[sea-foam icing]] made of sugar and [[vanilla]].\n\nThe folk of [[Al Qahara]] in [[Raurin]] used sugar mixed with [[four]], [[egg]]s, and [[milk]] to make chocolate chip [[cookie]]s.\n\nPeople of the far-away [[Endless Wastes]] and [[Ra-Khati]] used chunks of sugar to sweeten their hot [[butter]] tea.\n\n[[Zakharan]] cuisine used sugar sparingly for some dishes as [[chicken]]s stuffed with mint and sugar.\n\nBrown sugar was produced in the distant lands of [[Malatra]] and the [[Malatran Plateau]]. The sugar was traded in large rock-like hard clumps and was considered a valuable commodity.{{Cite organized play/LJ/A Gathering of Heroes Interactive}}",
        "Notable Consumers": "*Lumped sugar was a treat to [[horse]]s. A renowned [[Harper]], [[Danilo Thann]], carried sugar lumps to placate the horse of his companion, [[Arilyn Moonblade]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n*Harper agent [[Olive Ruskettle]] was an avid consumer of sugar. She added five cubed of the sweet substance to her tea.\n*[[Neifion]], the Lord of Bats, served platters of sugar-crusted [[toast]]s and miniature sugared [[pear]]s in his castle, deep within the [[Feywild]].\n*[[Samas Kul]], a [[zulkir]] from [[Thay]], was an avid eater of sweets covered in simple sugar glaze in the late 14{{th}} century DR."
