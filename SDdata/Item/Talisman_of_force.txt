A '''''talisman of force''''' was a powerful defensive [[handglyph]] used by the [[Geomancer]]s of [[Kadar]] to erect a protective shield.

==Powers==
When activated this item created a ''[[wall of force|sphere of force]]'' that was {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in diameter and centered on the wielder. The protective barrier lasted for 24 minutes before dissipating.

Most ''talismans of force'' had between 2â€”8 charges. They could be recharged, but the process for doing so was known only to a select few [[wizard]]s in [[Rog'osto]].

==Description==
These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes.
