'''''Thurbrand's protector''''' was the battered wooden kite [[shield]] of the famous [[Cormyr]]ian warrior [[Thurbrand]] of [[Arabel]].

==Powers==
The ''+1 protector'' functioned as a similarly enchanted ''[[ring of protection]]'' and was impervious to permanent damage, as it magically sealed any cracks or breaks throughout the frame overnight.

Additionally, when the wielder rapped on the frame three times with their fingers or knuckles, the shield produced a bubble of air, 10 feet in radius. This globe moved with the shieldbearer, granting them breathable air within any gases or liquids through which they traveled.

==History==
Originally found within the hoard of a [[dragon]], the ''protector'' was wielded for years by Thurbrand. After some time, he sold it to King [[Osbrun]] of [[Tsurlagol]] within [[the Vast]]. Some time around [[1351 DR]], the shield was looted in a grand theft of the city-state's royal armory. Its whereabouts after that were unknown.
