        "mainbody": "court scepter was a scepter used in Cormanthor.\nPer the Srinshee, a court scepter could be used to read the powers of spells and duplicate them. However, it had limited charges.\nElminster later used the scepter to duplicate a spell cast earlier that evening rather than one as it was cast. The scepter could also be used to store a copy of an ongoing spell and reveal its powers.\nThe Srinshee gave one such scepter to Elminster Aumar in  prior to his standing in for the Coronal for a revel in the Hallows. Later that evening, he employed the scepter to determine the properties of a field during his Hunt. He spent some power from the scepter in order to power a different spell afterwards.\n* Elminster Aumar"
