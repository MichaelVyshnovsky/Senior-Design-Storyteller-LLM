        "mainbody": "'''Opal''' was a milky [[gem stones|gem stone]] related to [[black opal|black]] and [[fire opal]]s, but occurred slightly more frequently.",
        "Description": "The substrate of opal was usually an opaque pale blue, while the inclusions flashed green to gold.\n\nOpals were considered sacred by followers of [[Lliira]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. White opals specifically were sacred to followers of [[Hathor]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12}}",
        "Powers": "Opals had a high affinity to magic and were used in casting numerous spells and in the creation of magic items, especially those that stored spells for later use. and those blessed by the [[Seven Sisters]]. Opals were also used in ''[[Ring of water walking|rings of water walking]]''.\n\nOpals could be substituted for other, more scarce materials when constructing magic items because of their ability to release spells just as if they were cast normally, with no change in range, power, or effect. When enchanting opal or using it as part of a magical procedure, the best results were obtained at [[hours of the day|twilight]]. According to [[Elminster]], this was around 6 o'clock in the evening.\n\nOne extremely important caveat regarding opal: it was never to be used in creating items that attempted to combine fire and lightning. Doing so resulted in an immediate chain reaction/explosion in which a large bolt of ''[[chain lightning]]'' was released with the additional effect of two ''[[Melf's minute meteors]]'' released in random directions whenever a cascading target was hit.",
        "Reputation": "Opals were considered prized gems among the [[drow]].",
        "Usages": "Opals were used in creation of ''[[necklace of sending|necklaces of sending]]'', sometimes created in [[Sembia]]."
