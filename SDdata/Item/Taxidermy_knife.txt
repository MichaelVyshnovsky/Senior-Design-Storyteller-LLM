Taxidermy knives were specialty blades created specifically to be used by taxidermy enthusiasts of the Sword Coast.
These knives were short and sharp tools of thin and long metal blades. Many were engraved with their owners initials due to the personal nature of such items.
The nature of such blades granted the wielder a slight advantage when crafting armor, traps, and weapons.
