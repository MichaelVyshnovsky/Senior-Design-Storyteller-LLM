        "mainbody": "The '''''banner of the krig rune''''' was a rare magical banner.",
        "Description": "The banner was made from a thick fabric that was dyed red. It was large, with dimensions of {{SI|5|ft}} in height and {{SI|3|ft}} in width. In the middle of the banner was a prominently displayed the ''krig'' rune, which stood for \"war\". The banner was often mounted on a pole and used as a standard.",
        "Powers": "When unfurled, the banner had several magical properties. It provided a temporary immunity to fear for the bearer and any ally within {{SI|20|ft}} of the banner. It also allowed the bearer to see invisible creatures and also protected the bearer and their allies from ranged attacks. Additionally, the banner's ability to provide immunity to fear could be permanently affixed to an area. The bearer drew a krig rune in the desired location. The process was lengthy, up to eight hours, and required the banner to be within {{SI|5|ft}} of the rune. The banner was destroyed during the process."
