It also allowed the bearer to see invisible creatures and also protected the bearer and their allies from ranged attacks. Additionally, the banners ability to provide immunity to fear could be permanently affixed to an area. The bearer drew a krig rune in the desired location. The process was lengthy, up to eight hours, and required the banner to be within  of the rune. The banner was destroyed during the process."
