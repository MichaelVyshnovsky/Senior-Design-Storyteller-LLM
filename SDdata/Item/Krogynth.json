        "Description": "Krogynth was a strong distilled alcoholic drink of greenish color due to being made using a fermented green mold. The drink was not known for its sophistication and was carried around in [[bucket]]s and served in giant-sized [[mug]]s. The resulting conception had a mild aroma, vaguely reminiscent of [[licorice]] root. Its taste was quite unique and abrasive. Those unaccustomed to the beverage said it tasted like \"[[currant]]s mixed with earwax.\""
