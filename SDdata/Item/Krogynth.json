        "mainbody": "Krogynth was a rare grog, or moonshine-like alcoholic beverage that originated from the Moonshae Isles.\nKrogynth was a strong distilled alcoholic drink of greenish color due to being made using a fermented green mold. The drink was not known for its sophistication and was carried around in buckets and served in giant-sized mugs. The resulting conception had a mild aroma, vaguely reminiscent of licorice root. Its taste was quite unique and abrasive. Those unaccustomed to the beverage said it tasted like \"currants mixed with earwax.\""
