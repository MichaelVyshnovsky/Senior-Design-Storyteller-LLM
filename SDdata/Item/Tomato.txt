Tomato was a delicate red fruit from Maztica. Dried tomatoes packed in oil were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Tomatoes could be consumed fresh picked, but they could not survive the trip to Faerûn in that state. Imported tomatoes had to be dried and preserved in oil, which intensified their sweet flavor. Tomatoes were frequently used in soups, salads, and candies.
Beyond their native land of Maztica, places in the Realms where tomatoes were known to be cultivated included
* North Faerûn In the Dalelands, these vegetables were cultivated by farmers in the Battledale and Mistledale regions.
* In south Faerûn, they were cultivated in the Arnaden region near areas with water.
* In the city of Arrabar of the Vilhon Reach, tomato sauce was used to fill spicy local delicacy – thaek buns.
