        "mainbody": "The Mask of the Dragon Queen was a key item in the efforts of the reformed Cult of the Dragon to free Tiamat from her imprisonment in the Nine Hells and to summon her to Toril.\nThe Mask of the Dragon Queen had models of five roaring chromatic dragon heads at its top, arranged like a crown. Its dragon-like visage covered the wearers face, neck, and shoulders.\nThe wearer of the Mask of the Dragon Queen gained a large number of powers, such as resistance to damage from acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison, as well as an increase in the potency of  attacks of any of those elements and improvements to defense and endurance. The mask also granted its wearer with darkvision and blindsight, as well as the understanding of Draconic.\nWhen two or more of the dragon masks were brought together, they magically transformed into the Mask of the Dragon Queen, combining the properties of all five individual masks.\nIn the 1480s DR, Severin Silrajin was capable of gathering all five masks to begin the summoning ritual, but was thwarted by an alliance between several factions of Faer√ªn and the heroic efforts of a group of adventurers."
