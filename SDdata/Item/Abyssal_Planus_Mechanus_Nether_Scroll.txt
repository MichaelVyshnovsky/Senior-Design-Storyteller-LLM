The Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll was one of the famed Nether Scrolls of the Planus Mechanus chapter, which related to planar travel, conjurations, and the mechanics of the planes.The Nether Scroll is never specifically named as such in-game, and is named in this article for clarity. It found prominent use by the forces of Thultanthar during the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon in the mid-1480s DR, and was fought over by various factions before being hidden by Elminster.

Despite the setbacks, the Netherese had managed to gather up several pieces of their own and gathered them at nearby Granwell Keep. While they examined the assembled fragments inside the captured fortress, their forces found and overcame the Harper Girmond Dyle nearby, who was organizing the Harper attack on the Keep as well as holding their own collection of Scroll pieces. The Netherese triumphantly returned with all the remaining Scroll fragments, displayed Girmonds remains at the entry to the keep, and set about reassembling the the pieces into a useful whole. Unknown to either side, local yuan-ti had been monitoring the situation and planned to swoop in and steal the Scroll for themselves. However, they were unable to bring their forces to bear before the Harpers launched their own attack on the Keep.
In the midst of the Harper attack, one of the attendant arcanists was overcome by a lust for knowledge and power and accidentally used the Scroll to open a portal to the Abyss itself. The glabrezu Razagnol appeared before the terrified wizards, and mockingly informed them of what they had just done before summoning forth a horde of dretches. A three-way battle broke out between the demons, Netherese, and Harpers, which ended with the Netherese slain and the portal closing with Razagnols defeat as well.
The dust had barely settled when Elminster himself teleported in alongside Rina Belostos, having detected the portal opening but arriving just a moment too late to assist. With congratulations to all involved, the Old Sage took up the Nether Scroll himself and vanished, intending to hide it so thoroughly that the Netherese would never find it again.
