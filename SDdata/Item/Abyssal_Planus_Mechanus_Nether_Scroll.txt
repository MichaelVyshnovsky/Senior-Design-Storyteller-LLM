The '''''Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll''''' was one of the famed ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' of the ''Planus Mechanus'' chapter, which related to planar travel, conjurations, and the mechanics of the planes.<ref group="note">The Nether Scroll is never specifically named as such in-game, and is named in this article for clarity. It found prominent use by the forces of [[Thultanthar]] during the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]] in the mid-1480s DR, and was fought over by various factions before being hidden by [[Elminster]].{{DDO-time}}

|My heart is filled with doubt. This is a Nether Scroll, after all — it contains knowledge beyond imagining. If I managed to acquire all the Nether Scrolls, I'd be as powerful as a god — nay, I would be a god! Of course, I would be driven quite mad, my honor would be meaningless, and the [[Huntsilver]] name would be in ruin… No, my duty is to give up the scroll.

|My Lords,<br/>We have begun to analyze the Nether Scroll pieces that we have found so far. The power that it holds is almost inconceivable! We have not fully divined the scroll's purpose. [[Azmagol]] holds that the scroll deals with fiends, while [[Tamarkoth]] believes it tells the secrets of planar gateways. We know more when we obtain more scroll pieces.
|Netherese report
}}
The ''Scroll'' contained deep and powerful lore regarding the [[planes of existence]], especially that which tied to the [[Abyss]]. It could also be used as a spellcasting focus of sorts for powerful planar rituals, as it was more than able to channel immense magical energies. The artifact seemed to have a subtle and malevolent will of its own, though if it had any conscious opinions or goals they remained unknown.

===The Shadow Over Wheloon===
{{Quote
|My Lords,<br/>Once our operations here in Wheloon are complete I will return the Nether Scroll to the city of Shade. My research into it is far from complete. This scroll is part of the Planus Mechanus, and I'm sure we could use it to reach other planes. Imagine what we could do if Netheril's reach extended from [[Celestia]] to the [[Nine Hells]]!
|Archwizard [[Tyvrus]]'s letter to Thultanthar
}}
The [[Cormyr]]ean [[adventurer]]-noble [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]] first laid eyes on the ''Nether Scroll'' in the [[Storm Horns]], while he was roaming about Cormyr hunting for rare artifacts. In his whimsy, he considered it to be a suitable trinket to add to his collection, though he did not manage to actually obtain it at the time. Instead, the ''Scroll'' was taken by the forces of [[Thultanthar]], who were also in the area secretly recovering an intact ''[[mythallar]]''.

The [[Shadovar]] of Thultanthar used the ''Scroll'' as the centerpiece of their attack on the [[Cormyr]]ean city of [[Wheloon]] in the mid-1480s DR. Archwizard [[Tyvrus]] used it to force open a conduit between the [[Shadowfell]] and the [[Wheloon Prison]], called the [[Shadowfell Nexus]], and used it to move large quantities of soldiers and materiel into the city at [[Oldstone Hall]]. They managed to subvert a large portion of the city before the Cormyrean garrison became aware of the Shadowfell conspiracy, and their invasion threatened to completely conquer the city with their growing army.

[[File:Oldstone Hall Shadowfell.jpg|300px|thumb|''The area around Oldstone Hall was coterminous with the Shadowfell.'']]
Unbeknownst to both sides, the irrepressible Oriphaun was already in the prison city seeking thrills and interesting trinkets (he bribed the [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Wheloon/Drainage culverts|underground tunnels]] to smuggle him in), and he unwittingly discovered the Netherese in the process. He knew that his duty demanded that he put the good of the realm ahead of his pleasures, and so devoted his efforts towards uncovering how the Shadovar had entered the city and what they hoped to achieve there.

From the outside, the local Oversword [[Edric Crastmere]] and Constal [[Davny Selkin]] organized the [[Purple Dragons]], [[War Wizards]], and a number of [[adventurer]]s (who may have been from the distant world of [[Eberron]]) to investigate the odd events occurring within the darkened city. After uncovering the Netherese presence, the Wizard of War [[Jacinta Last]] managed to identify the cause of the Shadowfell incursions and sent a strike team into Oldstone Hall, where they found Oriphaun Huntsilver already prepared to steal the ''Nether Scroll'' himself.

After a brief discussion with the Cormyrean agents about the situation, Oriphaun climbed up the outside of the structure and planned to sneak in through a window where the archwizard Tyvrus kept the ''Scroll'', while Cormyr's forces fought through the manor, in part using the gossamer-thin Shadowfell border to overcome the defenders. The agents arrived at the top of Oldstone Hall's tower only to find Oriphaun already there, frozen in place by Tyvrus's magic and the ''Nether Scroll'' in his hand. After a grueling fight with the arcanist in both material and shadow realms, Tyvrus was slain and the Shadowfell Nexus collapsed, ending the Shadowfell connection to Wheloon and stranding the remaining Netherese forces inside the city. Without a moment to waste, Oriphaun took the ''Scroll'' away from the city in order to hide it from its former owners.

===The High Road of Shadows===

|I saw them again today — that's the third time. My life isn't worth a gold piece if I stay here. So off I go down the High Road, back to where it started. I'll have to get rid of the Nether Scroll. It's a shame; it's the pride of my collection. I'll tear it into pieces, and hide the pieces along the way I head west.
|Oriphaun, being a hero
}}
Oriphaun fled the scene in Tyvrus's tower as soon as he had the ''Nether Scroll'', knowing that would be pursued to the death by the agents of Netheril. He managed to make contact with the [[Harpers]] and was quickly initiated into the group, then vanished once more into the wilderness. In an attempt to buy time before the shades of Thultanthar recovered the ''Scroll'', or at least prevent them from getting the whole thing, he tore it into several pieces and hid them in various places along the [[High Road]] between [[Eveningstar]] and [[Tyrluk]], hoping that his Harper allies could muster their forces in time to stop the Netherese properly. With his part done to the best of his ability, Oriphaun moved on as quickly as possible to return to the Storm Horns, where he went on to discover a Netherese plot to raise a [[Amskar's enclave|flying enclave]] from a [[Rungnir's glacier|mountain glacier]].

The Harper response was assembled by [[Rina Belostos]], who set up shop in Eveningstar with a large crew of Harpers disguised as a traveling troupe of performers. They scoured the countryside where Oriphaun had hidden the ''Nether Scroll'' pieces, trying to find where they had been hidden and fighting the Netherese for them.

Despite the battlefield being in the heart of Cormyr, the Purple Dragons and War Wizards of the realm were largely absent from the matter, having already focused their efforts on the already pressing [[drow invasion of Eveningstar]] and [[Darkening]], untangling [[Lolth]]'s schemes to consume the [[Thread of the Weave]] and replace [[Mystra]] as the goddess of magic, and the ongoing situations in Wheloon and on the Sembian border. As a result, the High Road was left unprotected and became infested with bandits and [[werewolves]], and the Netherese were able to bring in large numbers of agents and an army's worth of amoral sellswords to support their efforts. This allowed them to operate openly and without opposition as they searched for the legendary magical artifact. One of their most overt acts was their assault on [[Granwell Keep]], an isolated [[Purple Dragons]] fort in the nearby [[Blooded Wood]], which they then used as their base of operations along the High Road.

===The Detour===

|Oriphaun, writing the least magical phrase possible on a Nether Scroll
}}
The [[Harpers|Harper]] agent [[Bensen Virandson]] recovered the first piece near the [[Greenweald Trail]], a path through the [[King's Forest]].  He and his escorts fought through a small army of hired thugs and an elite mercenary team led by the psychopathic [[Dom (mercenary)|Dom]] as they transported it to a hidden [[Harper lodge (King's Forest)|Harper safehouse]] deeper in the woods. Along the way, the fighting triggered magical reactions from the ''Scroll'' piece, causing [[dretch]]es from the Abyss to be spontaneously summoned (to everyone's displeasure). Despite discovering the hidden lodge thanks to the [[druid]] [[Rand (druid)|Rand]], the Netherese agents were unable to stop the Harpers, and the ''Scroll'' piece was safely delivered.

[[File:Old Man's Face Nether Scroll.jpg|300px|thumb|''A new and novel use for Nether Scrolls: bar tabs.'']]
Oriphaun hid another piece in plain sight inside the [[Old Man's Face Inn]] of Tyrluk. In a masterful stroke of cunning, Oriphaun scribbled a promise of payment for services rendered upon the blank side of the scroll and had bartender [[William Windsphere]] pin it up in the taproom amid other receipts and notes. When the sellswords arrived with their Netherese commanders [[Wyle]] and [[Tarys]], they walked right past the ''Nether Scroll'' fragment as they ransacked the establishment and were unable to locate it before Rina's Harpers and adventurers arrived and defeated them.

One fragment was hidden in the collapsed chambers of [[Beckside Castle]], a ruined keep commonly used as a camping spot. The pursuing arcanists [[Keldan Shadeskein]] and [[Gaston Wyrst]] took over much of the castle along with their summoned monsters and hired blades, but before they could abscond with the ''Scroll'', Harper agents caught up with them and slew them, taking it for themselves.

Oriphaun also dropped a piece off with his good friend [[Seamus]], a hermit who lived in the dismal [[Lost Souls' Swamp]]. While the Netherese did not discover this piece, the [[medusa]] [[Sshaastess]] detected the magical energies and took it for herself, and drove Seamus out of his own home as she made the swamp her domain. Harper agents had to fight through enslaved [[elemental]]s, maddened [[dryad]]s, and fierce wildlife before even getting to her, but managed to recover the ''Scroll'' regardless.

===The End of the Road===

[[File:Reassembled Nether Scroll.jpg|300px|thumb|''The Netherese reassembled the scroll, just in time to lose it.'']]
Despite the setbacks, the Netherese had managed to gather up several pieces of their own and gathered them at nearby Granwell Keep. While they examined the assembled fragments inside the captured fortress, their forces found and overcame the Harper [[Girmond Dyle]] nearby, who was organizing the Harper attack on the Keep as well as holding their own collection of ''Scroll'' pieces. The Netherese triumphantly returned with all the remaining ''Scroll'' fragments, displayed Girmond's remains at the entry to the keep, and set about reassembling the the pieces into a useful whole. Unknown to either side, local [[yuan-ti]] had been monitoring the situation and planned to swoop in and steal the ''Scroll'' for themselves. However, they were unable to bring their forces to bear before the Harpers launched their own attack on the Keep.

In the midst of the Harper attack, one of the attendant arcanists was overcome by a lust for knowledge and power and accidentally used the ''Scroll'' to open a ''[[portal]]'' to the Abyss itself. The [[glabrezu]] [[Razagnol]] appeared before the terrified wizards, and mockingly informed them of what they had just done before summoning forth a horde of dretches. A three-way battle broke out between the [[demon]]s, Netherese, and Harpers, which ended with the Netherese slain and the ''portal'' closing with Razagnol's defeat as well.

The dust had barely settled when [[Elminster]] himself ''[[teleport]]ed'' in alongside Rina Belostos, having detected the ''portal'' opening but arriving just a moment too late to assist. With congratulations to all involved, the Old Sage took up the ''Nether Scroll'' himself and vanished, intending to hide it so thoroughly that the Netherese would never find it again.
