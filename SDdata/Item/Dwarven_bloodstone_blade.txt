'''''Dwarven bloodstone blades''''' were [[enchanted]] [[dwarven waraxe]]s decorated with [[bloodstone]]s mined in the [[Galena Mountains]] of [[Damara]].

==Powers==
''Dwarven bloodstone blades'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and a magically ''[[keen]]'' edge. Additionally, these waraxes dealt additional damage when wielded against [[giant]]s.

==History==
These weapons were crafted by the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Clan Hillsafar]] in the depths of the Galena Mountains. They were crafted in a variety of designs and possessed different magical powers. The first ''dwarven bloodstone blades'' were forged as gifts to a band of dwarven adventurers who helmed a campaign against the [[Thunkers|"Thunkers,"]] a band of giant bandits. These eccentric adventurers named themselves "Anti-Thunkers" after securing Clan Hillsafar's mining business from the giant menace. In the [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], the Anti-Thunkers moved on from the land of Damara, and copies of their bloodstone blades began appearing in other regions of the Realms. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''dwarven bloodstone blades'' were sold in [[Westgate]], among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's [[Market Triangle]].
