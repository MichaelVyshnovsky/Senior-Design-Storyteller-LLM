The earthen mantle was a magical cloak found in the Underdark in the mid-1480s DR.
The cloak was quartered with white and red, with a diamond in the center.
The earthen mantle greatly improved blasts of evocation and force-based magic, and oddly improved the wearers balance.
An earthen mantle could be found in the treasures of Mistress Laerionvyrs drow outpost in the Stonelands.
