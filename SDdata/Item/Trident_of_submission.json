        "mainbody": "'''''Tridents of submission''''' were [[enchanted]] [[trident]]s that damaged both opponents' bodies and their morale.",
        "Description": "Often enough, ''tridents of submission'' appeared ordinary and completely unremarkable.",
        "Powers": "However, these weapons possessed enchantments that, upon a successful strike, had a chance of demoralizing their targets. The feeling of despair and hopelessness that consumed affected creatures caused them to stop fighting and surrender. The duration of this magical effect was between two and eight minutes. Additionally, ''tridents of submission'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and held between 17 and 20 charges.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Umberlee]] in her [[avatar]] form wielded a powerful enchanted ''+3 trident of submission'' that additionally functioned as a ''[[trident of fish command]]''."
