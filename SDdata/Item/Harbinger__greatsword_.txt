'''''Harbinger''''', previously called ''Deliverance'', was a [[sentient item|semi-intelligent]] [[greatsword]] that possessed the essence of a particularly foul [[Harbinger (demon)|demon]] known by the same name.

==Powers==
The sword possessed a powerful ''+3 [[item enchantment|enchantment]]'' along with others powers.

The essence of the demon Harbinger gave the sword the ability to ''[[petrify]]'' any [[ogre]] it struck in battle. The fiend's rage erupted periodically as the sword was wielded, causing ''[[fireball|explosions of flame]]'' to erupt randomly when it struck any foe.

==History==
Originally known as ''Deliverance'', this magical greatsword once belonged to the  great hero known as [[Trueblood]].  When the demon called the Harbinger threatened the city of [[Luskan]], Trueblood defeated the fiend and bound it within his sword.

The demon Harbinger spirit corrupted the fabled sword, partially destroying its personality transforming it in a manner that more befit its name.

At some point ''Harbinger'' found its way to the region of the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the sword was in the possession of a [[drow]] merchant in [[Ust Natha]].
