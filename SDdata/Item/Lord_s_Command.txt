'''''Lord's Command''''' was a set of enchanted [[heavy armor]] that belonged to Lord [[Francis Tenraw]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==Powers==
''Lord's Command'' possessed the ''+1'' enchantment to the wearer's defenses and offered armor resistant to piercing weapons. Additionally, the armor's magic improved the owner's strength and provided some resistance to magic.

==History==
''Lord's Command'' was a set of armor commissioned and custom crafted for Lord Francis Tenraw when he was expecting a war that ended up never happening. With no battles to protect the nobleman in, ''Lord's Command'' became Francis' ceremonial garb and served him in this fashion until his death of old age. The lord's daughter inherited this piece of armor but eventually solid it to pay for a new library building for her subjects.

By [[1372 DR]], ''Lord's Command'' was in stock at the shop of [[Derval Ironeater]] in [[Daggerford]].
