'''Fezzes''' were a form of headwear common among men of all social classes in the land of [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
A fez was a short felt hat that had a round, conical shape with a flat top, with most standing at a height of around {{SI|6|in|long=yes}}. Tassels that were roughly as long as the fez itself hung from the hat's crown. Red with a black tassel was the most common coloration of fez, though others were prevalent.

==Prices==
In the bazaars of Zakhara, a fez could generally be bought for around five [[copper piece]]s to two [[silver piece]]s, depending upon how well one haggled.
