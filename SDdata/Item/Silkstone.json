        "mainbody": "Silkstone was a fibrous variety of quartz similar to tiger eye.\nThis ornamental stone was found in many colors, yellow being the most common, and was cut cabochon, tumbled, or used for engravings\nLike tiger eye, silkstone was worn as a protection from spirits, though this was more old wives tale than fact. However, shadows were known to hesitate briefly when encountering someone wearing a silkstone, perhaps giving them time to flee. This property also made powdered silkstone a viable substitute component when casting spells related to life-energy drain and the restoration of those effects. It was also used in the creation of magical inks needed to make scrolls of those spells."
