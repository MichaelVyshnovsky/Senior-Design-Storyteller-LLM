        "Description": "This [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] was found in many colors, yellow being the most common, and was cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]], tumbled, or used for engravings",
        "Powers": "Like tiger eye, silkstone was worn as a protection from spirits, though this was more old wives' tale than fact. However, [[shadow]]s were known to hesitate briefly when encountering someone wearing a silkstone, perhaps giving them time to flee. This property also made powdered silkstone a viable substitute component when casting spells related to life-energy drain and the restoration of those effects. It was also used in the creation of magical inks needed to make scrolls of those spells."
