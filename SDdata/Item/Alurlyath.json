        "Description": "This full-bodied sweet white wine had a slightly nutty aftertaste. Alurlyath glowed with silver and green light, further enhancing it on a romantic evening. It was usually stored in special ceramic bottles during transport to keep the light from fading.",

However, alurlyath was a rare find that could be found in the tavern's wine cellar.\n* The [[Friendly Arm]] inn in the [[Western Heartlands]] offered alurlyath for six [[gold]] [[coin]]s per serving.\n* In [[Athkatla]], the capital of [[Amn]], alurlyath was available from the luxurious [[Mithrest Inn]].",
        "Prices": "Undermountain ''Alurlyath'' could be purchased from Aurora's in the following containers:\n* Ceramic bottle (5 [[sp]])\n* Hand keg (30 sp)\n* Cask (8 [[gp]])\nAurora's noted that contact with this wine's creators was required to purchase more than a hand keg."
