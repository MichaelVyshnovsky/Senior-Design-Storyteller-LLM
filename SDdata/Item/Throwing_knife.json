        "Description": "A throwing knife usually had a double-edged, pointed blade, as opposed to a typical knife, which only had a single edge and was a bit shorter. Unlike a [[dagger]] used for melee combat, throwing daggers often had a shorter handle, and were weighted much differently.\n\nThey could be found throughout Faerûn, on both the surface and in [[the Underdark]]. These weapons could be used in melee combat (although not their primary use), instead of a normal dagger, but were far less effective.{{Speculation}}",
        "Notable Throwing Knives": "* ''[[Dagger of Set]]'', enchanted throwing knives of the [[Old Empires]] region that were used by [[warrior]]s who served the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi power]] [[Set]].<ref>"
