        "mainbody": "ulkulusters deathstaff was an extremely powerful quarterstaff, that could create unique spell effects.\nThis artifact was created by Gulkuluster, one of the most powerful wizards of Halruaa, as a means to destroy any potential foe.\nThe deathstaff created effects that mimicked a fireball spell that had a larger area-of-effect and was exceptionally more destructive. It expanded this power with other elements, and could produce a frostball, electricity ball, acidball, sonicball in a similar manner. Using any of these abilities expended one of the staffs 50 charges.\nIt was also unique in that the deathstaff regained one charge every week. If all the charges were used, it became nonfunctional for one week."
