        "History": "This [[artifact]] was created by [[Gulkuluster]], one of the most powerful [[wizard]]s of [[Halruaa]], as a means to destroy any potential foe.",
        "Powers": "The ''deathstaff'' created effects that mimicked a ''[[fireball]]'' spell that had a larger area-of-effect and was exceptionally more destructive. It expanded this power with other elements, and could produce a ''frostball'', ''electricity ball'', ''acidball'', ''sonicball'' in a similar manner. Using any of these abilities expended one of the staff's 50 charges.\n\nIt was also unique in that the ''deathstaff'' regained one charge every week. If all the charges were used, it became nonfunctional for one week."
