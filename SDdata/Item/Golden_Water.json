        "mainbody": "olden water was a special liquid that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nGolden water was only found in springs that were connected to the Elemental Plane of Water and was often guarded by marids. \nGolden water could actually create a tiny rift into the Elemental Plane of Water. Just a single drop of this water created a fountain in that location that lasted forever. Once removed from its source, golden water would retain all of its magical properties only if it was kept within a valuable bowl. Golden water placed anywhere else would still create a perpetual fountain, but the water would be normal water.\nSeveral drinking fountains in Huzuz were created from golden water."
