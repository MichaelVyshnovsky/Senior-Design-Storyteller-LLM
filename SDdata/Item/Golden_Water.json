        "Description": "Golden water was only found in springs that were connected to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] and was often guarded by [[marid]]s.",
        "Powers": "Golden water could actually create a tiny rift into the Elemental Plane of Water. Just a single drop of this water created a fountain in that location that lasted forever. Once removed from its source, golden water would retain all of its magical properties only if it was kept within a valuable bowl. Golden water placed anywhere else would still create a perpetual fountain, but the water would be normal water.\n\nSeveral drinking fountains in [[Huzuz]] were created from golden water."
