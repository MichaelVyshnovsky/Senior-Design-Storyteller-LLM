The '''''Mask of the Dragon Queen''''' was a key item in the efforts of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] to free [[Tiamat]] from her imprisonment in the [[Nine Hells]] and to summon her to [[Toril]].

==Description==
The ''Mask of the Dragon Queen'' had models of five roaring [[chromatic dragon]] heads at its top, arranged like a crown. Its dragon-like visage covered the wearer's face, neck, and shoulders.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ''Mask of the Dragon Queen'' gained a large number of powers, such as resistance to damage from [[acid]], cold, [[fire]], lightning, and [[poison]], as well as an increase in the potency of  attacks of any of those elements and improvements to defense and endurance. The mask also granted its wearer with [[darkvision]] and [[blindsight]], as well as the understanding of [[Draconic language|Draconic]].

When two or more of the ''[[dragon mask]]s'' were brought together, they magically transformed into the ''Mask of the Dragon Queen'', combining the properties of all five individual masks.

==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]], [[Severin Silrajin]] was capable of gathering all five masks to begin the summoning ritual, but was thwarted by an alliance between several factions of [[Faer√ªn]] and the heroic efforts of a group of adventurers.
