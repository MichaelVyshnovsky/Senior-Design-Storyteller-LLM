A '''''feathertoken''''' was a charm enchanted with the [[pluma]] [[spell]] ''[[create talisman]]''.

==Powers==
''Feathertokens'' bestowed several useful enchantments upon whoever carried them. A ''[[feather fall]]'' power could be used once per day. Anyone touching the ''feathertoken'' wearer when the ''feather fall '' was activated would also benefit from the magic. A ''feathertoken'' exuded a magical area of effect centered on the wearer that extended in a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} circle around them, making it harder for enemies to strike the wearer while also granting them stout magic resistance. These protections extended to any allies within the circle of influence as well.
