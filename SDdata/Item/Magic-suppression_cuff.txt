'''''Magic-suppression cuffs''''' were [[:Category:Bracelets|bracelets]] or [[manacles]] that prevented the wearer from casting [[spell]]s or using other [[magic]]al abilities.

==Description==
''Magic-suppression cuffs'' were worn loosely about the wrist, and consisted of two overlapping loops of golden metal that met at a lock. A ''cuff'' was locked or unlocked with a key.

==Powers==
Anyone who wore a ''magic-suppression cuff'' was unable to call upon their magical abilities, including spellcasting or powers such as ''[[wild shape]]''. Only a single ''cuff'' on one wrist was necessary to subdue the magic of even a mighty [[wizard]]. It was not necessary that the ''cuff'' be secured tightly to take effect.

==History==
When the [[High Sun Games]] were revived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} ''magic-suppression cuffs'' were placed on spellcasting participants to prevent them from using magic to survive the Games. A collection of such ''cuffs'', along with their keys, was maintained in a storage area beneath [[Neverwinter arena]].

As part of the Games, a group of [[adventurer]]s and thieves&mdash;[[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Doric]]&mdash;were sent into the Games to die by Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] and the [[Red Wizard]] [[Sofina]]. ''Magic-suppression cuffs'' were placed on both the [[sorcerer]] Simon and the [[druid]] Doric, who confirmed that they were unable to use their magical abilities while wearing them. However, Doric was able to lose her ''cuff'' after her arm became stuck in a [[gelatinous cube]], and the loose-fitting manacle came off when she pulled out her arm. Subsequently, the party escaped beneath the Arena and found the keys to remove Simon's ''cuff''. When they later fought the powerful Sofina, the party only managed to win by deceiving her into letting down her guard so that Edgin's daughter, [[Kira Darvis|Kira]], could sneak up using her ''[[pendant of invisibility]]'' and affix Simon's ''magic-suppression cuff'' onto Sofina's wrist.
