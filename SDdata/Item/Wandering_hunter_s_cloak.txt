'''''Wandering hunter's cloaks''''' were [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s made by the inhabitants of the nomadic [[Wandering Village]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Powers==
These cloaks were masterfully and painstakingly sewn together, and their outer surface was made out of soft [[wolf]]'s fur, enchanted to mask the hunter's scent and to allow them to hide in the darkness and shadow.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''wandering hunter's cloaks'' were crafted for all young hunters of the Wandering Village. Friends and visitors to the village could purchase these cloaks from [[Tahvo]] the Huntmaster, along with other supplies.
