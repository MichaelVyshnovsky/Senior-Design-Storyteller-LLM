A '''stinkpot''' was a grenade-like form of ammunition commonly used with [[sling]]s and [[staff sling]]s.

==Description==
Stinkpots consisted of a [[ceramic]] [[clay]] vessel filled with a mix of noxious substances, typically either burning [[sulfur]] or [[quicklime]]. Upon shattering, the vessel unleashed a noxious cloud that sickened everyone within {{SIrange|10|20|ft|long=yes}}, causing nausea, the eyes to water, coughing and choking. This cloud of vapor would naturally disperse.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Kobold]]s commonly made and utilized stinkpots in their slings,<ref> including those that inhabited the [[Moonsea]] region.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|18}}<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Raiders of the Twilight Marsh|16}}
