        "mainbody": "ryplate was a simple and hearty dish favored by common folk and traveling merchants alike. Fryplate was often served across communities of Northwest Faer√ªn and Savage Frontier. One restaurant of note that served fryplates was the Maid of the Moors of Mornbryns Shield.\nA typical fryplate was cheap and filled bellies. The dish was assembled out of fried bacon and fried tomatoes. Then the chunky fried goodies were covered with a generous helping of sliced almonds and fried wild mushrooms. The platter was then smeared with rich buttered scrambled eggs, cooked with peppercorns, and a drizzle of brandy."
