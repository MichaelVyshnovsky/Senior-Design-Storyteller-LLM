        "Description": "Chitin web armor was a rare type of armor made from the hardened web of [[chitine]]s. All chitines could create web armor for themselves and maintain it indefinitely. Nonchitines could pay chitine weavers to make web armor. This armor lasted for about three [[Calendar of Harptos|months]] before it started to deteriorate. After six months it would have completely dissolved. Web armor could also be built to resemble [[studded leather]] armor, by weaving metal studs into it."
