All chitines could create web armor for themselves and maintain it indefinitely. Nonchitines could pay chitine weavers to make web armor. This armor lasted for about three months before it started to deteriorate. After six months it would have completely dissolved. Web armor could also be built to resemble studded leather armor, by weaving metal studs into it."
