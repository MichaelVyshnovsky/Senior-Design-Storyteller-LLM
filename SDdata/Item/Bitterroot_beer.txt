'''Bitterroot beer''' was a smoky-tasting alcoholic brew made from [[bitterroot]], popularized by residents of [[Candlekeep]]

==History==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], bitterroot beer was served at the [[Lady Luck Tavern]] in [[Daggerford]]. And by [[1372 DR]], other taprooms around Daggerford were serving the smoky beverage. It could be found in the [[Happy Cow]] in the Money Quarter, and to the south along the [[Trade Way]] in the city of [[Liam's Hold]].
