A [[wolf]] totem... a good luck charm. I won it from my cousin's husband who thought he'd beat me at my best game! Perhaps some dark day I'll run across a man with a stronger gut than me, then I'lI pass the charm on to him...''|Guthewulfe Henghelm}}",
        "Description": "These magic charms were small pieces of [[silver]], fashioned in semblance of a [[wolf]]'s head.",
        "Powers": "To activate an ''howling wolf charm'', one must grip it hard and howl into the sky. This summoned a [[gray wolf]] under the command of the charm's owner. It was believed that they had limited power. With time and use, they became tarnished and eventually turned into silver powder once the last wolf was summoned. The strength of summoned wolves was similar to that of creatures summoned via the ''[[summon creature III]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, one of these charms belonged to [[Guthewulfe Henghelm]], a boisterous traveling trader of the Tribe of the Wolf who visited the town of [[Targos]] before returning back home with new goods. Guthewulfe was eager to bet the trinket in a ''[[braehg]]'' drinking competition. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, an [[amulet]] version of the charm was a part of the curio collection of [[Mintassan]] the Magnificent, a planeswalker from [[Westgate]]."
