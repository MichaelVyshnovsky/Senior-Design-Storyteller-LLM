        "mainbody": "A pearl of the sirines was a magic item capable of granting wondrous powers related to the sea to its wielder.\nRegardless of their magical enchantments, these beautiful pearls were worth at least 1,000 gp.\nThis item granted the wielder the ability to breathe underwater as if they were breathing clean air and swim at an incredible rate while underwater, and also protected the wielder from a sirines poison.\nTo unlock and understand the powers of the pearl of the sirines, the wielder needed to clutch the pearl tightly and perform any action related to the pearls powers.\nKhalil, a half-elven shair who sailed the Great Sea near Zakhara, carried a pearl of the sirines."
