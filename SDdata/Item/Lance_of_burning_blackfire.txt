'''''Lances of burning blackfire''''' were ''+1 [[Corrosive (weapon quality)|corrosive]] heavy [[flaming]] [[Pole arm#Lance|lances]]'' and the preferred weapons of the [[Griffon Cavalry]] of [[Waterdeep]]. They were made from the wood of a [[zalantar]] tree and inscribed with runes of the deity [[Mystra]].

Fashioning one of these weapons required the crafter to utilize one of these spells: ''[[acid fog]]'', ''[[acid storm]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', or ''[[storm of vengeance]]''; and one of the following: ''[[flame blade]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', or ''[[fireball]]''. The cost of materials was typically 9,410 [[gp]], but they sold for almost double the cost.
