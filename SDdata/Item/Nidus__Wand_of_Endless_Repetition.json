        "mainbody": "Nidus Wand of Endless Repetition was a type of extremely rare magical device that could curse its targets with being stuck in an endless loop until death claimed them.\nNidus Wands of Endless Repetition usually contained between 4 and 48 charges. When its command word was uttered, the wand emitted a cone of grey light. Each minute of the light consumed a single charge. Unfortunate creatures caught in the radiation had a chance of resisting the wands magics. Those touched by Nidus Wand were always cursed with the devices ill effects, which forced the creatures to repeat actions they performed in the two minutes before being affected. If the action being repeated was a spell, then the caster was forced to repeat incantations and casting gestures regardless of being actually able to reproduce it. The wands curse forced the actions to be performed first, then performed in reverse, and repeated again. When the affected creature perished, its corpse continued performing the same actions until the corpse itself disintegrated and fell apart.\nThe effects of Nidus Wand of Endless Repetition functioned like a curse. They could be removed via dispel magic, remove curse, limited, or regular wish spells.\nThe secret of creating Nidus Wand of Endless Repetition was said to have been lost to the ages however, several of these wands existed. The devices were named after an ancient wizard named Nidus, famous for the oath of \"Nidus Curse!\"\nIn the late 14 century DR, a victim of Nidus Wand of Endless Repetition could be found on the second level of Halaster Blackcloaks mega-dungeon of Undermountain. What once was a human adventurer decayed into a skeleton cursed with endlessly swinging its sword and moving across the room."
