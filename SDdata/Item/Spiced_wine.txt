'''Spiced wine''' was [[wine]] with added [[herb]]s produced in [[Calimshan]] and [[Tethyr]]. A variety was available for sale through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']].

==Description==
[[Spice]]d wine was said to be an effective remedy against nausea, cough and sore throat.

Each individual spice was used to make a different flavor of spiced wine. Typical flavors which could be ordered through ''Aurora's'' included [[raisin]]s, [[cinnamon]], [[fennel]], [[anise]], [[nutmeg]], and [[clove]].

Spiced wine or mulled wine was especially popular in [[north Faer√ªn]] for its warming taste and potency. This northern type of mulled wine was made from cheap red wine steeped with citrus rinds and spices.
