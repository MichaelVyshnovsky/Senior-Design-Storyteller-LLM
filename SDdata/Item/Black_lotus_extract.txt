'''Black lotus extract''' was a potent [[poison]] created using the [[black lotus]] orchid-like flowers. The poison was created in a powder or [[oil]] form.{{Cite dragon/121/The Deadliest Perfume|28}}

==Description==
The powder took effect within seconds of skin contact. The substance's high price was due to black lotus blooming only once per three years. The toxin contained within was extracted as oil.{{Cite dragon/391/Assassin, Executioner|33}}

==Effects==
Black lotus extract was considered to be one of the most deadly contact poisons ever devised. Few survived encounters with those whose blades were coated in the dangerous substance. When black lotus extract touched the skin of a creature, it immediately affected their physical health, quickly weakening them and likely ending in death.

==History==
Agents of the [[Zhentarim]] grew their own black lotus plants to produce the deadly toxin ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, black lotus extract was imported into [[Samarach]] and sold by [[mind flayer]] merchant slavers in the black market located to the east of the city of [[Samargol]].
