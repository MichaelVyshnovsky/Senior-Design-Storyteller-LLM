This allowed an individual to swiftly travel from place to place within dense jungle environments. Additionally, these bracers could enhance a wearers ability to jump and leap, similar to boots of striding and springing, though this effect would only activate if a jump would culminate in some sort of activity related to brachiation. These included such things as moving through treetops, climbing a tree or pole, and grasping a rope, vine, or other flexible object vine.\nIn the land of Zakhara, the region known as the Cities of the Ancients was host to a variety of magic items whose creation were inspired by the gods that were once worshiped there in ancient times.
