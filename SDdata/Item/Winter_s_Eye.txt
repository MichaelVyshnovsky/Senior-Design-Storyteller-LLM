The '''''Winter's Eye''''' was an enchanted [[longsword]] of ''[[frost]]'' that appeared to be aflame. The sword belonged to the commander of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] named [[Ellis]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Powers==
''Winter's Eye'' was an enchanted ''+2 longsword of frost'' that was enspelled with multiple sets of the ''[[continual flame]]'' as a joke. The constantly flaming sword did not burn upon hit, instead freezing its opponents. The sword also often tricked Ellis' opponents into using magics that made them resistant to flames, which of course, was useless against ''Winter's Eye''.

==Creation==
Blades similar to ''Winter's Eye'' could be forged by experienced crafters of magic arms and armor using the spells of ''[[chill metal]]'' or ''[[ice storm]]'', and three charges of the ''continual flame'' spell.

==History==
In 1369 DR, Ellis and his branch of the Cult of the Dragon were occupying the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], making base in the [[Castle Cormanthor]]. ''Winter's Eye'' was kept on Ellis' self during the day, and in his quarters in the Castle Cormanthor's sub-levels at night.
