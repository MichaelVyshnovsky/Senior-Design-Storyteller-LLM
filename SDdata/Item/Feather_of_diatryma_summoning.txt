A '''''feather of diatryma summoning''''' was a [[magic item|magic]] feather that temporarily transformed into a [[diatryma]] at the service of its summoner.

==Description==
''Feathers of diatryma summoning'' were brightly colored plumes that were produced from feathers of diatrymas.

==Powers==
Upon pronouncing the ''feather's'' command word and throwing it into an empty space, it transformed into a diatryma for up to 6 hours, following its summoner's commands and helping its summoner's allies. The summoned bird could also be used as a mount. The bird could be dismissed early if killed or if the summoner pronounced the command word again, while touching it. It then reverted to feather form.

After being used, the power of a ''feather of diatryma summoning'' could be used again after 7 days.

==Notable Owners==
The mercenary [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] owned a ''feather of diatryma summoning''. He wore it as an ornament to his hat.
