        "Powers": "When thrown, this sand tore both living and non-living surfaces for three full minutes before expiring. Against non-living material one handful of ''rasping sand'' would literally destroy up to 100 pounds (45 kg) of the object in question.\n\nLiving creatures suffered increasingly devastating damage while the sand eroded their flesh.\n\nDespite its terrifying reputation, ''rasping sand'' could be easily counteracted with a gallon of water per handful of sand. The water would instantly negate the sand, causing it to dissolve. \n\nAnyone wishing to throw a handful of ''rasping sand'' needed to wear a protective glove or risk becoming the object of its deadly affection."
