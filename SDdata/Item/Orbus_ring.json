        "mainbody": "An orbus ring was a type of magical jewelry that improved the speed at which a mage could navigate a spelljammer while at its helm.\nThese extremely sought-after rings were carved from ivory intertwined with platinum. Their power was drawn from residual magic of the remains of an orbus.\nWhen not at a spelljamming helm, the wearer of an orbus ring experienced no magical effect or enhancement of abilities.\nAn original, and more powerful, set of orbus rings was crafted long before the 14 century DR, although the secret of their construction was lost for over a hundred years. However, a cache of these rings were eventually discovered on the Rock of Bral. The only known dealer of these 2 generation rings was the spelljamming expert, Gamalon Idogyr."
