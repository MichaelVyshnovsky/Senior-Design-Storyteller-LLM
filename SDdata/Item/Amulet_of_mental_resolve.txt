'''''Amulets of mental resolve''''' were a type of mind protecting [[amulet]] made of [[cold iron]].

==Powers==
These amulets enhanced the minds of their wearers, giving them an improved chance to resist [[charm]]s, [[illusion]]s, and magical effects that would put one to sleep.

''Amulets of mental resolve'' came in enchanted variants ranging from ''+1'' to ''+6''.

==History==
Around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s operating in [[Tymanther]] were sent into an ancient [[Unther]]i burial site near [[Ruinspoke]] to recover [[Melnar]], a member of the [[Gem Assayers Union]] that had gone missing.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|4-5}}<ref group="note" name="Unther">It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or [[Tymanchebar]]. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. While exploring a mausoleum in the area that was guarded by a skull enchanted with ''[[Skull Watch]]'', the adventurers came across a stone [[sarcophagus]] belonging to a [[Lathander]]ite named [[Jagress Dawnlion]]. Hidden beneath a false bottom in the sarcophagus the adventurers found a number of [[gold piece]]s, a ''+1 amulet of mental resolution'', and a ''+1 [[symbol of turning]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|15}}
