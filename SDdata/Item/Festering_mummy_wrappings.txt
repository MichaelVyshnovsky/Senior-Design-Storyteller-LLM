The '''''festering mummy wrappings''''' were an unpleasant piece of [[necromancy]]-imbued [[cloth]] found in the [[Stonelands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote

==Powers==
When worn as a belt of sorts, the wrappings were a powerful aid to an [[undead]], [[pale master]] [[necromancer]]s, or some other creature that benefited from [[negative energy]]. The wrappings improved their ability to heal with negative energy, to resist purifying light, and violently reacted to those that struck against them with an effect similar to ''[[inflict wounds]]''.

==History==
The wrappings were found in the treasure pile of the [[red dragon]] [[Daeronnax]], the master of [[Clan Daeronnax]]. Given the proximity, he may have stolen them from his neighbor, the [[mummy]] [[Laeron]].
