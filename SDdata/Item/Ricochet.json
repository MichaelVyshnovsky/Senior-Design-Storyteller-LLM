        "mainbody": "Ricochet was an enchanted sling that once belonged to an elven monk named Silence before 1372 DR.\nRicochet had a +3 enchantment and allowed its wielder to cast the quillfire spell once per day.\nSometime before 1372 DR, Ricochet was an unnamed magic sling in the hands of a monk called Silence, named after his vow of silence. The slings name was earned during one fateful event when the monk was pursued by an arcane archer through weeping and twisting catacombs. The long chase resulted in Silence being cornered. Filled with resolve, the monk aimed at the archers moving silhouette and loosed the sling using all his strength. The bullet bounced off the catacombs wall and ricocheted down the stone hall, hitting the pursuer in the middle of his chest, stunning him. That momentary loss of guard gave Silence an opening to subdue the arcane archer with a flurry of punches.\nEventually, the sling known as Ricochet found its way into the hands of Yentai, the agent of Iron Throne who briefly operated a store in the hamlet of Gillians Hill in 1372 DR."
