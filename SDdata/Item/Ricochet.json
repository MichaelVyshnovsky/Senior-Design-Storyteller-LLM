        "History": "Sometime before 1372 DR, ''Ricochet'' was an unnamed magic sling in the hands of a monk called Silence, named after his vow of silence. The sling's name was earned during one fateful event when the monk was pursued by an [[arcane archer]] through weeping and twisting catacombs. The long chase resulted in Silence being cornered. Filled with resolve, the monk aimed at the archer's moving silhouette and loosed the sling using all his strength. The [[bullet]] bounced off the catacombs' wall and ricocheted down the stone hall, hitting the pursuer in the middle of his chest, stunning him. That momentary loss of guard gave Silence an opening to subdue the arcane archer with a flurry of punches.\n\nEventually, the sling known as ''Ricochet'' found its way into the hands of [[Yentai]], the agent of [[Iron Throne]] who briefly operated a store in the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]] in 1372 DR."
