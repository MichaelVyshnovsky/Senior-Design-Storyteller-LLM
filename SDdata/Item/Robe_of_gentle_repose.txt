A '''''robe of gentle repose''''' was a garment that when worn would halt the decomposition process. This was especially valued by [[undead]] who wished to maintain the appearance of still being a living creature.

==Description==
The ''robe of gentle repose'' was an unassuming garment. It appeared as an open-fronted robe of light green.

==Powers==
Especially prized by [[undead]] who wished to masquerade as living creatures or simply did not want their bodies to decay, the robe could halt all decay and decomposition of a creature's corporeal form whilst worn, operating in much the same fashion as a permanent ''[[gentle repose]]'' spell.

==History==
Around [[1372 DR]], an example of this item had come into the hands of the [[lich]] [[Umaerh]]. Thanks to the robe he could still pass for a healthy male [[drow]] while he resided in [[Irae T'sarran]]'s [[Undying Temple]].
