It was exported as far as the Western Heartlands, the lands along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate, as of the late 15 century DR.\nThis high quality yet harsh-flavored wine was in high demand among those of discriminating taste palettes. It was sold in small  round green glass corked bottles."
