The '''''Lifebringer''''' was a unique [[circlet]] created by [[Yrre|Yrre the Sparkstruck]].

{{Quote|Lightning is like magic. And what is magic but life itself?|Yrre.}}

==Powers==
Whenever the wearer of ''Sparkle Hands'' built up electrical charges within their body―a feat achieved using some of Yrre's other inventions―their life force was bolstered. That increased vitality stayed with them until the charge left their body.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the circlet was in the possession of [[Blurg]], a member of the [[Society of Brilliance]] who worked near [[Ebonlake Grotto]].
