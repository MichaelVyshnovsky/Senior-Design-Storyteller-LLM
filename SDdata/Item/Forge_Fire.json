        "mainbody": "Forge Fire was an enchanted light hammer that retained the blazing heat of the forge it was crated in.\nForge Fire had the +2 enchantment and retained the scorching head of the forge it came from, dealing fire damage to its targets.\nThe first Forge Fires origins were tied to the adventuring past of Thalantyr the Conjurer and the traumatic incident when he was held prisoner by a powerful creature. Thalantyr refused to share the details of the story or how Forge Fire was enchanted to be as hot as the forge it was created in.\nBy 1372 DR, Derval Ironeater was creating replicas of the fiery hammer in his smith shop in Daggerford, Dervals Bright Blade.\n*Veiti Ironeater, the daughter of Derval Ironeater, wielded Forge Fire when she guided the heroes of Daggerford through the dangerous ruins of Illefarn in 1372 DR."
