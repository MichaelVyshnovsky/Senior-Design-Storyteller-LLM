Rings of scholars were common minor magic items found across the Sword Coast in the late 14 century DR.
Rings of scholars were improved versions of the rings of insight. Additionally to the enchantments that improved the wearers knowledge of lore, rings of scholars were ensorcelled to glow with white light, illuminating an area of  around them. They were especially beneficial in the dark libraries or dungeons, by lighting the way for curious scholars.
By 1372 DR, these common pieces of enchanted jewelry were found across many pockets, fingers, and merchant stalls across the Sword Coast, the Moonsea, and in cites such as Neverwinter and Daggerford. Aptly named, these rings were popular among scholars and sages, similarly to the left powerful but similar ring of insight.
