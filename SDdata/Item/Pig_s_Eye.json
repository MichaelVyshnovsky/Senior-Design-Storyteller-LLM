        "mainbody": "'''''Pig's Eye''''', originally named '''''Gruumshacan''''', was the [[elf|elven]] enchanted [[short sword]] created to slaughter [[orc]]s.",
        "Description": "''Pig's Eye'' was a beautiful sword with a decorated blade and with an orcish glass eye embedded in its hilt. The sword's name and the glass eye were a reference to the legend of [[Corellon]], the father of elves, and [[Gruumsh]], and their famous battle in which the orcish god lost his eye to the First of the [[Seldarine]].",
        "Powers": "''Gruumshacan'' was a ''[[Moonblade]]'' of the House Caith. It possessed a ''+2'' enchantment, which dramatically grew in strength when the sword was wielded against orcs. Upon a successful hit, ''Pig's Eye'' had a coin-toss of a chance of blinding its orc target.",
        "History": "''Gruumshacan'' was crafted in the {{YearlinkName|239}} by an elven enchanter named [[Shenarr Caith]] for his [[ranger]] cousin, [[Velaic Caith]]. The ranger wielded the ''Pig's Eye'' against vile orcs of [[Cormanthor]] who menaced the City of Song, [[Myth Drannor]]. The blade was passed along to the ranger's son [[Tredain Caith]] and grandson, [[Galesic Caith]]. The sword remained within the family for many centuries until House Caith decided to relocate to [[Evermeet]]. The family decided to sell ''Gruumshacan'', the family's invaluable ''Moonblade'', to finance their aged uncle [[Shenarr Caith]]'s transformation into a [[baelnorn]]. Shenarr found it amusing that ''Pig's Eye'' allowed him to avoid natural death.\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], ''Gruumshacan'' ended up in the hands of [[Conlan]], the proprietor of [[Kuldahar]]'s blacksmith shop."
