Tempertuppins Ever-Throwers were enchanted slings that magically produced their own bullets.
Tempertuppins Ever-Throwers possessed a +1 enchantment, and similarly to the weapon that inspired them, magically materialized bullets that were engulfed in flames and exploded upon reaching the target.
These slings were created by Bindle "Eye-nock" Tempertuppin, who claimed he witnessed a fire giant using a similar weapon but  "big enough to throw a donkey 300 paces". He, however, did not appreciate anyone questioning this and usually responded humorously with "youll be sorry when a giant puts YOUR ass in a sling."
By the late 14 century DR, Tempertuppins slings could be found in Neverwinter and the Moonsea region.
