'''''Oil of elemental invulnerability''''' was a type of magical [[oil]] that would provide complete protection against one of four [[element]]s, coming in [[air]], [[earth (element)|earth]], [[fire]] and [[water]] varieties.

==Powers==
Those who applied this substance to their body would become completely invulnerable to harm from the mundane forces of the associated element—such as floods, earth slides, wind storms, and so on—for a period of one day. This oil did not protect against harm afflicted by [[elemental]]s. This effect primarily applied to the [[Prime Material plane]], though a few instances of these oils were also effective on the [[Inner Planes]]. Each bottle of ''oil of elemental invulnerability'' contained eight applications of this substance, enough to cover one [[human]]-sized creature for eight days or eight individuals for one day.

==Notable Owners==
* These were among the [[magical item]]s commonly used by [[planewalker]]s and could be purchased in the markets of [[Sigil]] at prices lower than those on the Prime Material.
* [[Husam ibn Aasim al-Zalim]], a [[Zakharan]] [[fire mage]], carried an ''oil of water elemental invulnerability''.<ref>

==Trivia==
Some magical oils were outwardly mistaken for being ''oils of elemental invulnerability''. This included ''[[oil of fumbling]]'' and ''[[oil of sulphur]]''.
