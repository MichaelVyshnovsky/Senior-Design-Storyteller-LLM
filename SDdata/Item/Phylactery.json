        "mainbody": "A phylactery (also sometimes called a jar and it was necessary for the lich to maintain its undead state and escape being destroyed. Every phylactery was unique, in nature, defense, and means of destruction.\nMaking a phylactery was a highly expensive and taxing effort, requiring a high degree of spellcasting ability and total materials valued at 100,000 to 120,000 gp. While any object could be chosen to be the lichs jar or phylactery, it must be made of a solid material (and not wood) and be of high-quality craftsmanship. It could be non-magical or already be a magical item. It must cost no less than 2000 gp or much more, at least several thousands of gold pieces according to the makers spellcasting power.\nFirst, a prospective lich must cast the spell enchant an item on the object. If this worked, this was followed by trap the soul. The phylactery would glow with blue-green light to indicate that it was ready for the aspiring lich to place a fragment of their soul within it. If it was successfully made receptive to a soul, the would-be lich cast magic jar on the object, thereby making it the phylactery. This had the effect of binding the casters soul to the mortal realm, stopping it from going onto the Outer Planes after death. Permanency and reincarnation could also be required, as might Nulathoes ninemen.\nNext, the lichs soul entered the jar for the first time, which required them to drink a highly toxic brew known as a lichnee potion. This experience of being shunted into the phylactery was an exhausting process that caused a loss of life-force and might, as well as erasure of their most powered prepared spells. Once their soul and vitality were successfully stored in the jar, they could leave and rest for at least a few days to recover.\nCreation of the phylactery took a tenday to achieve. Only after it was complete could the lich commence the deadly ritual to fully achieve lichdom. A lich who survived the destruction of their phylactery could create a replacement at half cost.\nEven before becoming fully a lich, the jar was of benefit to its still-living creator. If they died by any cause, their soul returned to the jar, regardless of how far away or what obstacles were before it, but it lost life-force and power once again. They could then reemerge and possess any dead body in the vicinity, whether their own, anothers, an animals, or an outsiders, becoming something like a wight.\nIf a lichs physical body was destroyed, it could regenerate itself where its phylactery was located within a tenday, with a new body appearing adjacent to it. However, if the phylactery itself was destroyed, then the lich could not regenerate and would remain destroyed.\nTo sustain the power of the phylactery and their undead existence, a lich needed to fuel it with the souls of others. They used the imprisonment spell to trap the soul of a victim within the phylactery it would be held there for a full day before being consumed entirely unless freed with a dispel magic. A lich that did not trap souls in the phylactery regularly risked decaying physically and ultimately becoming a demilich.\nTherefore, to guarantee destruction of a lich, it was necessary to destroy both body and phylactery. However, destroying the phylactery was difficult and usually a special item, weapon, or ritual was needed.\nFor this reason, liches sought to guard their phylacteries thoroughly against any attack and to place them in secure and secret locations.\nHowever, as a lich needed to be able to come and go and have spare bodies to inhabit, the jar needed to be in some accessible location one that was too well-hidden might see them trapped. A lichs jar could not be found by locate an object, unless enacted by a god and even then the range was limited to the same plane and a distance of .\nThe spell of epic magic called Aumvors fragmented phylactery let a caster have multiple phylacteries, either by splitting an existing phylactery into multiple pieces or turning several other items into phylacteries, though the number created in one casting was limited. The lichs enemies were forced to destroy all the phylacteries, so permanently destroying the lich became almost impossible.\nA lich whose phylactery was seized by another might be obliged to serve its holder, as happened to Rhangaun of the Twisted Rune. Alasklerbanbastos, the Great Bone Wyrm of Threskel, kept the phylacteries of minion dracoliches \"in trust\".\nIt was claimed that the demon lord Orcus, the patron of liches, could immediately obliterate the phylactery of any lich he was displeased with.\nA common form of phylactery was a sealed metal box, from the size of a fist to  wide. Inside of this were strips of parchment bearing magical phrases and sigils written in silver or the would-be lichs blood these were the spells of naming and binding, dark magic, and immortality that maintained the lichs existence. However, a phylactery could be any number of things, such as a ring or amulet, provided it had an interior space in which such writings could be placed. Other possibilities were a gem or even a totem doll. Jewels, magical items, stones, bones, books, swords, and even mythals were all known.\nThe Netherese lich Aumvor the Undying made his phylactery the rune-inscribed skeleton of his former rival Dethed, an apprentice of Ioulaum. He used his fragmented phylactery spell on it so often that by 1374 DR all 206 bones of the skeleton were his phylacteries. Most of them were shrouded from divination magic and stashed in secret places all around the Endless Caverns, with a few in more distant places.\nThe Lichdrow Dyrr kept his phylactery, a beljuril, within a guardian golem shaped like a spider in the temple to Lolth in the estate of House Agrach Dyrr.\nWulgreth used the artifact known as the Karsestone as his phylactery. It was last known to be in the hands of no less than the goddess of darkness Shar.\nOf dracoliches, Iltharagh, \"Golden Night\", made his phylactery a large golden topaz sphere in a platinum stand, kept within his treasure hoard. Kazmil-urshula-kelloakizilians was concealed in a book of creation, a relic of the Witch-King Zhengyi. Dretchroyasters phylactery was the sword Dragonslair and Greshrukks was to be a glassteeled ruby in the pommel of a sword named Dragonstooth, before his transformation was interrupted and failed. Reveilaein the half-dragon dracolich made his phylactery the headband of intellect he wore.\nRaerlin seems to have made his phylactery a book that came into Elminsters possession by 1355 DR.\nIn 1373 DR, Sammaster completed his transformation of the Dracorage mythal, binding his phylactery to its capstone chamber. This precipitated a Rage of Dragons independent of the King-Killer Star.\nIn 1484 DR, the Harpells gave Catti-brie a blood-red sapphire ring to serve as a phylactery to trap the soul of the vampire Thibbledorf Pwent. After she instead used it to trap the lich Ebonsoul, she was forced to capture Pwent in Wulfgars horn of summoning."
