        "mainbody": "A lesser flith was a form of enchanted starmap.\nA lesser flith built by Delmuth Echorn occupied the upper half of a room with a domed ceiling. It was made of gemstones, presumably suspended in midair through magical or otherwise means.\nWhen stars were named in a lesser flith, their representation glowed with light. Even if the gemstone corresponding to a star was missing, the point in space would glow almost certainly.\nIn , Delmuth Echorn had nearly finished a lesser flith before his death."
