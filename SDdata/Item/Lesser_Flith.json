It was made of gemstones, presumably suspended in midair through magical or otherwise means.\nWhen stars were named in a lesser flith, their representation glowed with light. Even if the gemstone corresponding to a star was missing, the point in space would glow almost certainly.\nIn , Delmuth Echorn had nearly finished a lesser flith before his death."
