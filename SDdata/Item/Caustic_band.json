        "mainbody": "'''''Caustic band''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that granted the wearer the offensive power of [[acid]].",
        "Powers": "''Caustic band'' infused the wielder's weapons or fists with magical acid – this ''malefic excretion'' was released with each successful attack onto the targets. The ring's central big green [[gem]] released a faint sound of sizzling when it was adjusted on the wearer's finger.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one such ring belonged to [[Derryth Bonecloak]], a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[potion]] maker who ran a shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] and collected [[fungi]] in the [[Underdark]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
