He reported that 30 turns of the crank brought up {{SI|5|gallon|long=yes}} of water, and noted its potential use in pumping hot [[oil]].\n\nThe concept of the screw pump was seemingly independently invented in multiple locations. This included the [[House of Gond]] in [[Essembra]], where such devices were put on display for the public, and the [[Steps of Istishia]] in [[Keltar]], where the pumps were used to supply water to the top of the enormous fountain structure."
