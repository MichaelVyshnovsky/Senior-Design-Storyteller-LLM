        "mainbody": "A screw-lift water pump was a simple but ingenious mechanical device used to pump water vertically.\nThe pump lifted water by means of carrying it inside its screw-shaped chamber as it rotated.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a version devised by the mind of Nadul DaRoni, valued at 75 gp. He reported that 30 turns of the crank brought up  of water, and noted its potential use in pumping hot oil.\nThe concept of the screw pump was seemingly independently invented in multiple locations. This included the House of Gond in Essembra, where such devices were put on display for the public, and the Steps of Istishia in Keltar, where the pumps were used to supply water to the top of the enormous fountain structure."
