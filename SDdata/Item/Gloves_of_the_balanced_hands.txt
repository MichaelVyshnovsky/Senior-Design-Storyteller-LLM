Gloves of the balanced hands were enchanted gloves used for training apprentice rangers of Moonwood, to the north from Silverymoon.
These leather gloves were of a fine make.
Gloves of the balanced hands gave the wearer full proficiency in double-wielding melee weapons and made them ambidextrous. If the wearer was already proficient in two-weapon fighting, their skill was improved further, allowing them to make an additional attack in battle.
A person familiar with crafting wondrous items trade could create a pair of the gloves of the balanced hands, using the spells of righteous might or Tensers transformation.
These gloves were used by the experienced rangers of Moonwood in training their apprentices. Even though these gloves were rarely seen outside of the rangers home forest and Silverymoon, some stray gloves could be found around the Sword Coast region.
*The Collector, a mysterious and rich inhabitant of Neverwinters Blacklake District circa 1374 DR.
*Douglas Fairbanks, a man so ambidextrous, "his tears ran down the back of his neck," whatever it may mean.
*Talli, a Harper quartermaster who followed the Harper hero named Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed Lands in the late 15 century DR.
