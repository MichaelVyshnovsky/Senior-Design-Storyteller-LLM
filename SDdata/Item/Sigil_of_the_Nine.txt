The Sigil of the Nine was a wondrous artifact from the city of Neverwinter that summoned the deceased members of the Neverwinter Nine to the Jewel of the Norths defense in the times of need.
When the Sigil of the Nine was activated, the souls of the Neverwinter Nine entered the battlefield, helming a vicious all-out attack, all while boosting the morale of the caster and their allies, increasing their attack and defense for a short period of time.
The Sigil of the Nine was used by the heroes of the Siege of Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR in defense of their home against enemy hordes and against the Cloaked Ascendancy.
