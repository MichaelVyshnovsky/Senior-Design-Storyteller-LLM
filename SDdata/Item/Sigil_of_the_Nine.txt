The '''''Sigil of the Nine''''' was a wondrous [[artifact]] from the city of [[Neverwinter]] that summoned the deceased members of the [[Neverwinter Nine]] to the Jewel of the North's defense in the times of need.

==Powers==
When the ''Sigil of the Nine'' was activated, the souls of the Neverwinter Nine entered the battlefield, helming a vicious all-out attack, all while boosting the morale of the caster and their allies, increasing their attack and defense for a short period of time.

==History==
The ''Sigil of the Nine'' was used by the heroes of the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] in defense of their home against enemy hordes and against the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]].
