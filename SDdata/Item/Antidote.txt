An '''''antidote''''', or more literally, a '''''potion of cure poison''''', was a [[potion]] that could cure a specific [[poison]], or multiple poisons.

==Description==
Antidotes were a direct cure for a poison. However, they weren't the only way to rid poison, as the poisoned creature could be cured by [[cleric|clerical]] or [[druid|druidic]] [[magic]]. They could also cure against [[magic]]al [[poison]]s. Some poisons were antidotes to other poisons. Sometimes even a poison was the antidote to itself, such as specific doses of ''[[srindym]]''.

There were many ways to make antidotes, as they cured individual types of poisons, and thus required a range of ingredients in their production. A common ingredient for antidotes was the horn of a [[unicorn]]. Another recipe for a thick and chewable antidote was made using a variety of herbs and roots, including [[salt]]s of [[mugwart]] and a certain type of alchemical suspension.

In the land of the [[Malatran Plateau]], antidotes were brewed using curative herbs found in the Living Jungle and kept in yellow-skinned [[gourd]]s.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand/Certificates}}
