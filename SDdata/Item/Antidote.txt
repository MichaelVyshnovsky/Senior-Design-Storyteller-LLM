An antidote, or more literally, a potion of cure poison, was a potion that could cure a specific poison, or multiple poisons.
Antidotes were a direct cure for a poison. However, they werent the only way to rid poison, as the poisoned creature could be cured by clerical or druidic magic. They could also cure against magical poisons. Some poisons were antidotes to other poisons. Sometimes even a poison was the antidote to itself, such as specific doses of srindym.
There were many ways to make antidotes, as they cured individual types of poisons, and thus required a range of ingredients in their production. A common ingredient for antidotes was the horn of a unicorn. Another recipe for a thick and chewable antidote was made using a variety of herbs and roots, including salts of mugwart and a certain type of alchemical suspension.
In the land of the Malatran Plateau, antidotes were brewed using curative herbs found in the Living Jungle and kept in yellow-skinned gourds.
