        "mainbody": "Monks belts were enchanted belts created by the monks of the Ladys Hand Monastery in the Nether Mountains.\nMonks belts were very humble-looking ropes that were tied around the wearers waist.\nThese belts possessed the enchantment that drastically improved monks unarmed combat skills and made their blows unstoppable. Monks belts also allowed their wearers to cast haste once a day.\nIn the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR, the monastery of the Ladys Hand was attacked by Morueme dragons. The monks were able to fight the threat off using their Netherese magic, which included enchanting and equipping every monk with these belts."
