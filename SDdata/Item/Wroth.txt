Wroth cards were used for both gaming and fortune-telling purposes, especially among "oldblood" families of the Sword Coast. When used as a fortune-telling device, the cards were not understood to reflect immutable future outcomes rather, they warned only of possible futures, and those who heeded the meaning of the cards could potentially alter their fate.
These cards originated in ancient Netheril. Wroth cards were thought to have mystical connections to the gods.
