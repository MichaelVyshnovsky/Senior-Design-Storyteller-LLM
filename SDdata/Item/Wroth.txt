* '''Paeryl, the Mother'''; A depiction of a human female, a simple but nurturing mother and cook.

* '''The Rising Dragon''': Number twenty in the deck.
* '''The Seer''': A depiction of an [[elf]] standing over a pool that reflects a battle.
*'''The Sentinel'''
* '''Tethyla, The Dark Lady''': A depiction of a female human clad in dark robes, one who consorts by night with [[undead]] and willingly submits to the shape-change spells of evil magic-users.

==Uses==
Wroth cards were used for both gaming and fortune-telling purposes, especially among "oldblood" families of the [[Sword Coast]]. When used as a fortune-telling device, the cards were not understood to reflect immutable future outcomes; rather, they warned only of possible futures, and those who heeded the meaning of the cards could potentially alter their fate.

==History==
These cards originated in ancient [[Netheril]]. Wroth cards were thought to have mystical connections to the gods.
