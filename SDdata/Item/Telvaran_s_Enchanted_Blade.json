        "Powers": "It possessed all the same powers as a ''[[rod of lordly might]]'', and others that were not recorded.",
        "History": "In [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 1350s DR, an unnamed female [[human]] [[adventurer]] presented a magical sword to the sage [[Othiiyr Velthrann]] for identification. He found it to ''Telvaran's Enchanted Blade''. But the client [[teleport]]ed away without even paying, so Othiiyr revealed the finding to others—when a client didn't pay, it was permitted to break the traditional bond of secrecy meant to exist between sages and clients. Its location and ownership remained unknown."
