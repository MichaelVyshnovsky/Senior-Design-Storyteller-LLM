Hew was an enchanted dwarven battleaxe that was stashed in the hoard of the green dragon, Venomfang.
The axe, which had a +1 enchantment, was rusty, but its looks were misleading. It had an engraving of its name, Hew, in Dethek. The origin of the magic battleaxe was unknown, but it ended up as part of Venomfangs hoard in Thundertree by 1491 DR.
Hew was forged by a dwarf that warred with dryads, who would attack him when he went to cut firewood. Its powers allowed it to strike plant creatures, or those of wood, at the maximum possible damage the wielder was able to deal.
