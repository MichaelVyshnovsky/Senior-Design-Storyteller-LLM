'''''Hew''''' was an enchanted [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[battleaxe]] that was stashed in the hoard of the [[green dragon]], [[Venomfang]].

==Description==
The axe, which had a ''+1'' enchantment, was rusty, but its looks were misleading. It had an engraving of its name, ''Hew'', in [[Dethek]]. The origin of the [[magic]] battleaxe was unknown, but it ended up as part of Venomfang's hoard in [[Thundertree]] by [[1491 DR]].

==History==
''Hew'' was forged by a [[dwarf]] that warred with [[dryad]]s, who would attack him when he went to cut firewood. Its powers allowed it to strike plant creatures, or those of wood, at the maximum possible damage the wielder was able to deal.
