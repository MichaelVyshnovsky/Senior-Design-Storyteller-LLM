Baeranth was the favorite meat pie of the city of Tantras, popular throughout the Sword Coast circa 1490 DR.
Tantras baeranth was a hearty meat pie or a tart with pepper gravy inside the hard dough shell, baked until golden brown. Despite Tantras being a city rich with fish and eel, the meat pie was the most popular dinner dish.
The authentic Tantran baeranth was stuffed with a variety of three smoked meats cow, goat, and pig. The correct ratio of the meats was 311. Regardless, some old wives tales always claimed that missing cats, dogs, and even people inevitably ended up inside baeranths.
The pies were always served hot, and, in Tantras, could be purchased at any time of the day from dozens of places all around town. Some of the Tantran baeranth bakeries were Karvins and Thurnans Oven and The Meltmouth.
Fish was never part of a baeranth. Even the mere idea of that was offensive to the people of Tantras.
Baeranths in Tantras came priced from 2 cp for one to 1 sp for a six-pack. Overall, the price varied greatly depending on the pies size, freshness, and the name of the baker of the shop. The pies that were exported and sold throughout the Sword Coast usually went for 5 gp in the late 15 century DR.
