        "mainbody": "The Light Pump was an unlikely device created in Myshella during the time of Netheril.\nThe device was split into five parts. One of them, the Body was a large L-shaped block of stone, on which the other parts were mounted. The mounting block bore a flower-like device with metal petals, some of which carried lenses these could be folded inside, once the second part, a fist-sized ruby called the Heart, was placed inside. The other three parts were metal staves each topped with a  round ruby, titled Compassion, Respect, and Pity. Each staff had a prismatic cross-section one with eight sides, one with six sides, and one circular. Each could only fit into the correct socket on the device.\nOnce assembled, the contraption could concentrate light into deadly rays. Those rays dealt moderate damage but, most importantly, were not magical at all so they could pierce the defenses of creatures immune to magic.\nUsing the weapon to destroy the ruby core of the stone juggernaut attacking Myshella would cause it to explode, but it was the only way to break it.\nThe light pump was ideated by Garavan during the times of Netheril, as a response to a phaerimm device of mass destruction anticipated by the Myshellan diviners. They had foreseen a weapon come to slay them, but to their surprise, it turned out to also be immune to magic and constantly lifedraining its surroundings, killing many of them before they managed to damage it. Garavan finally thought of the light pump, a device known elsewhere as a laser cannon, in order to defeat the construct.\nThe device was never used, however, as the great mages of Myshella instead sacrificed themselves to hold off the weapon once it arrived.\nAs of , the Light Pump was still hidden in a Myshellan temple, disassembled. The Body as half-buried under sand, while the others were held by four statues in the same room."
