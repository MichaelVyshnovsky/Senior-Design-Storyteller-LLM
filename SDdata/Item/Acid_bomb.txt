Acid bombs were vials of highly reactive acid that could be used as deadly thrown grenade-like weapons.
Simple in design, when shattered, acid bomb vials explode into dangerously corrosive clouds of acid fog.
In the late 14 century DR, acid bombs were common weapons encountered on the Sword Coast, Delimbiyr Vale, Underdark, and many other places.
