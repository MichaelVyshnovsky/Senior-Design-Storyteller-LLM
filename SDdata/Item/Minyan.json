        "mainbody": "A minyan (or minyarn\nEven though it was a small shrine, a minyan was still quite large, being some  in length. Similar to a palanquin, it was mounted on poles carried by bearers. They were heavy enough that twenty men were needed to lift and transport them. Minyans could contained holy texts or the remains of important figures in the faith.\nIn Kara-Tur, many monasteries and temples possessed their own minyans. These were overseen and maintained by the senior priest or a chosen underling such a person must have morals matching their faith. They were carried by groups of sohei, whether into battle or in processions through communities.\nAs a minyan represented its deity, it required veneration in a like manner. Each day, incense and offerings must be placed before it and a shukenja of the religion must perform services. Moreover, on holy days, the minyan must be paraded through the streets outside for all to witness and respect the deity. If these duties were not kept up, then the minyan lost its magical power forever.\nEmpowered by its deity, a minyan had several magical powers to bestow on those of the faith, and on those against it. It could be used to remove a curse on allies thrice a day or lay an ancient curse on foes once a month. In battle, it bolstered the morale of allied sohei who could see it, while causing fear in those of opposing ethos who approached within , who might flee in panic for a minute. Finally, it could heal someone to full health once every seven days.\nThe Blue Stork monastery of the Path of Enlightenment in Shou Lung had a minyarn of an altar holding holy texts and its founders remains. When this minyarn was stolen by bandits, the sohei Shyarn Feng was charged with recovering it, but the effort cost the lives of all his team and the minyarns power was lost.\nThe Floating Cloud School of the Way of Enlightenment in Kozakura contained Zezen Itos \"Great Interpretation of the Way of Enlightenment\".\nThe Shining Temple of Bishamon in Wa had a very large minyan that needed thirty pilgrims to carry it. It was paraded through the town of Aru in the Ceremony of the Three Thousand steps."
