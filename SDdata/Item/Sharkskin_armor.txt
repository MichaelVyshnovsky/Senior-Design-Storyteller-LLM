'''Sharkskin armor''' was a type of armor used on [[Toril]].

==Description==
Sharkskin armor was a type of armor made from the treated skin of [[shark]]s. Sharkskin armor was tougher than [[leather armor]] but similar in appearance. The sharp scales of the sharkskin remained attached to the outer surface of the armor and shark teeth were often embedded along the forearms, shoulder and legs. These could be used to break from [[rope]] bonds or to deal more damage in combat.

==Powers==
Sharkskin armor possessed increased protection against fire and [[acid]] damage. When it was worn by anyone apart from aquatic humanoids, it felt too tight and restrictive, enough to negatively affect their movement and dexterity.

==Usage==
It was first developed by [[aquatic elf|aquatic elves]] who were members of small, evil, reclusive sects. However, most aquatic elves didn't actually wear sharkskin armor, owing to their strong dislike of sharks, and found the idea repulsive. A studded leather armor variation existed â€“ [[shark skin and coral armor]].

[[Wereseal]]s wore sharkskin armor and carried sharkskin shields.{{Cite dragon/41/Dragon's Bestiary}}

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, these types of armor were rarely seen on any other creatures apart from [[sahuagin]] of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].
