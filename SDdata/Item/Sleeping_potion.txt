'''''Sleeping potions''''' were magical [[potion]]s that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. They were only carried or used by [[holy slayer]]s.

==Description==
''Sleeping potions'' had a tart taste.

==Powers==
After imbibing this potion, the imbiber fell into a peaceful sleep for a few hours. Sleep from this potion had the safe positive effects of a full night's rest; thus, this potion was often used by spellcasters to rapidly increase the rate at which they could re-memorize [[spell]]s. Being woken during this sleep nullified any of these positive effects.
