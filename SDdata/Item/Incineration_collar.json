        "mainbody": "'''''Incineration collars''''', or simply '''''kill collars''''', were tools of slavery and subjugation used by the [[cultists of Bane]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "''Incineration collars'' were made as a series of sharp-edged purse crystals encased in a [[Collar (animal)|collar]] chassis of [[gold]]. The crystals glowed when activated and when they resonated with the corresponding ''[[Prinski's Motivator]]s''.",
        "Powers": "Each ''Motivator'' was connected to a number of ''incineration collars'' always located nearby; once activated, they could instantly kill all the collared persons. If the Black Gauntlet dropped the crystal device, it automatically activated with some delay, killing every shackled slave around it. If ''Prinski's Motivator'' was handled by someone unaware of its inner workings, it had a chance of detonating itself, along with the nearby ''incineration collars''.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Motivators'' and ''incineration collars'' were used by the Black Gauntlets of [[Bane]] under the leadership of Lord [[Enver Gortash]] to \"motivate\" [[Gondian]] workers of the [[Steel Watch Foundry]] to produce [[steel watcher]]s around the clock. Followers of Bane, the god of tyranny, insisted that enslaved Gondians remained aware of what they were forced to do and suffered from knowing what they'd done."
