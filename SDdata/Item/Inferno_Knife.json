        "mainbody": "The Inferno Knife was an ancient enchanted dwarven dagger from Myth Drannor.\nThe Inferno Knife was a sturdy small blade made out of burgundy-colored metal.\nThe Inferno Knife possessed a +3 enchantment and allowed its wielder to spray arcane flames, similarly to the burning hands spell. The dagger held ten charges.\nThis enchanted blade was sealed within a chest in the Halls of Light of the Dwarven Dungeons sometime before the  underground complex was sealed by the fleeing survivors of the Weeping War.\nIn 1369 DR, the chest containing the magic dagger was discovered by a halfling rogue, merchant, and a scavenger Nottle. The chest was guarded by three wraiths, somehow bound to the chest as its defenders. The halfling was captured by the Cult of the Dragon before retrieving the item. Later, Nottle told of the items location to the Veiled Ones as a reward for his freedom."
