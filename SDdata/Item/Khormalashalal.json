        "Description": "''Khormalashalal'' was a blackened spear with a trefoil-blade. The blades were inscribed with various [[silver]] protective runes. The wooden shaft was decorated with depictions of [[dragon]]s and warriors.",
        "Powers": "The spear could be wielded when mounted, when it acted like a +3 [[lance|heavy horse lance]], or on foot where it was a +4 weapon. The wielder could throw the spear with accuracy up to {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} and it would always return to their hands after striking a target. ''Khormalashalal'' was especially deadly when wielded against [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[drow]], and [[undead]]."
