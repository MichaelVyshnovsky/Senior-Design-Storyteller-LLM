        "mainbody": "A '''''titanstring bow''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[longbow]] that relied on the raw physical strength of the owner for its damage.",
        "Description": "''Titanstring bows'' were proof that the thin and slender archer stereotype was a false one. This powerful bow could only be fully pulled by an individual of great strength and wrists of iron.",
        "Powers": "Apart from a regular ''+1'' enchantment to the bow's aim and damage output, a ''titanstring bow''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> power was dependent on the wielder's muscles.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''titanstring bows'' could be purchased from one of the [[Zhentarim]]'s smugglers and merchants named [[Brem]], who laired underneath the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, and from a [[bugbear]] merchant [[Lann Tarv]] who served [[the Absolute]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]]."
