The music from the wand could be heard up at a distance of up to . When the caster stopped waving the wand around, the music ended. The wand had three charges, which were recharged daily at dawn. When the caster used the last charge, there was a chance the wand could spontaneously crumble into dust, while playing a mournful note from a tuba.\nHundreds of years prior to 1492 DR, a basilisk in the Maddgoths Castle level of Undermountain consumed a wand of conducting that became trapped intact within its stomach when an adventurer reflected its petrifying gaze back at the basilisk with a mirror."
