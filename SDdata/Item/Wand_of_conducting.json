        "Powers": "With this wand, the caster was able to create beautiful orchestral music while waving it around like a conductor. The music from the wand could be heard up at a distance of up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. When the caster stopped waving the wand around, the music ended. The wand had three charges, which were recharged daily at dawn. When the caster used the last charge, there was a chance the wand could spontaneously crumble into dust, while playing a mournful note from a tuba.",
