A '''''Docent''''' was a kind of [[Sentient item|sentient]] magical object that could be used by [[warforged]] as an augmentation to their form. Though native to the isolated world of [[Eberron]], similar artifacts were not unknown in the lands of [[Faerûn]], either.{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
''Docents'' were typically embedded inside the body of a warforged, most often inside the chest. Eberronian ''Docents'' were usually made of metal, but objects that functioned similarly to them could also be made from [[gemstone]]s, wood, stone, or [[dragon]]scales.

==Powers==
''Docents'' could be made to impart almost any sort of magical effect, but most improved the bearer's resistance to physical and magical harm, acting not too differently in utility from a variety of other defensive magical items.

==History==
As warforged were not known to Faerûn, Docents were likewise an unknown concept. However, when some [[adventurer]]s from Eberron arrived in the mid-1480s [[DR]], various local magical artifacts were identified as similar enough to Docents as to be considered interchangeable.

==Notable ''Docents''==
* An ''[[ancient gemstone]]'', found in a [[Temple of Mystra (King's Forest)|Temple of Mystra]].
* ''[[Entropic heartstone]]'', a magical gemstone containing the power of [[Graz'zt]].
* ''[[Heartwood]]'', a pseudo-Docent made from wood.
* ''[[Livewood core]]'', a piece of living wood from a [[druid]]ic grove.
* The ''[[memory of fine regalia]]'', a stone from [[Barovia]] imbued with haunting memories.
* ''[[Stone heart]]'', a stone lump from the [[Demonweb Pits]].
* ''[[Templar's docent]]'', an Eberronian ''Docent'' used by knights of the [[Church of the Silver Flame]].
