A Docent was a kind of sentient magical object that could be used by warforged as an augmentation to their form. Though native to the isolated world of Eberron, similar artifacts were not unknown in the lands of Faerûn, either.
Docents were typically embedded inside the body of a warforged, most often inside the chest. Eberronian Docents were usually made of metal, but objects that functioned similarly to them could also be made from gemstones, wood, stone, or dragonscales.
Docents could be made to impart almost any sort of magical effect, but most improved the bearers resistance to physical and magical harm, acting not too differently in utility from a variety of other defensive magical items.
As warforged were not known to Faerûn, Docents were likewise an unknown concept. However, when some adventurers from Eberron arrived in the mid-1480s DR, various local magical artifacts were identified as similar enough to Docents as to be considered interchangeable.
* An ancient gemstone, found in a Temple of Mystra.
* Entropic heartstone, a magical gemstone containing the power of Grazzt.
* Heartwood, a pseudo-Docent made from wood.
* Livewood core, a piece of living wood from a druidic grove.
* The memory of fine regalia, a stone from Barovia imbued with haunting memories.
* Stone heart, a stone lump from the Demonweb Pits.
* Templars docent, an Eberronian Docent used by knights of the Church of the Silver Flame.
