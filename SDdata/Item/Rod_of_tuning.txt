A '''''rod of tuning''''' was a magical [[rod]].

It could produce any tuning note, which was useful for [[bard]]s or [[cleric]]s of [[Milil]] when tuning musical instruments, but it was also capable of creating other, magical notes, with powerful effects. Once per day it could create a note that acted as a ''[[holy word]]'' spell to any evil creatures within 30 feet (10 m). Also, once per day it could create a note that acted as a ''[[banishment]]'' spell to [[outsider]]s within 30 feet. This note had three aspects that the creature hated. The rod could also act as a focus for any song-based or [[sonic]] spell.
