The '''''hammer of the weaponsmith''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[hammer]], used by the best craftsmen of the ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The ''hammer of the weaponsmith'' was a small but heavy tool.

==Powers==
This magic hammer was enchanted to dramatically improve the wielder's crafting and weaponsmithing skills when working with metal.

==History==
The ''[[tongs of the armorer]]'', along with the ''hammer of the weaponsmith'', were placed on display within the Artisan's Hall within the [[Crypt of Rothilion]]. The magic tools could be found in the Smith's Alcove to the left from the entrance to the tomb. The Crypt of Rothilion was sealed before the advent of hte [[Weeping War]] and the fall of Myth Drannor. The tomb remained undisturbed until it was unsealed in [[1369 DR]] buring the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s attempts to take over the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' within the ruined City of Song.
