'''Moonslake''' was an alcoholic [[apple]] [[cider]] produced at [[Moon Mountain Brewery]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|80}}

==Description==
The brewery had its own apple orchard and from the harvest they pressed cider that was allowed to ferment. In the warmer months, they used the distillery, but in winter they just set small kegs out to freeze and scraped the ice off the top.{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|81}}

==Reputation==
Moonslake was most popular among [[halflings]] and [[gnomes]]. [[Humans]], as a general rule, greatly disliked the minty finish, and most [[half-elves]], [[elves]], and [[dwarves]] fell somewhere between these two extremes. As of the 1370s DR, sales of this beverage increased dramatically in [[Waterdeep]] on the widespread rumors (started by some clever halflings) that drinking this beverage increased alertness and stamina, decreased the need for sleep, and made the imbiber more attractive to the opposite sex.
