Moonslake was an alcoholic apple cider produced at Moon Mountain Brewery, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
The brewery had its own apple orchard and from the harvest they pressed cider that was allowed to ferment. In the warmer months, they used the distillery, but in winter they just set small kegs out to freeze and scraped the ice off the top.
Moonslake was most popular among halflings and gnomes. Humans, as a general rule, greatly disliked the minty finish, and most half-elves, elves, and dwarves fell somewhere between these two extremes. As of the 1370s DR, sales of this beverage increased dramatically in Waterdeep on the widespread rumors (started by some clever halflings) that drinking this beverage increased alertness and stamina, decreased the need for sleep, and made the imbiber more attractive to the opposite sex.
