'''Greatclubs''' were a larger, two-handed version of the standard [[club]].

==Description==
Greatclubs were bigger and heavier than regular ''clubs'' and typically augmented with spikes, nails and/or bands of iron.

==Weaponology==
Greatclubs were typically considered martial weapons due to their extra weight and spikes making it a bit more difficult to wield without hurting one's self.

==Notable Greatclubs==
* ''[[Mountain Fist]]'', an [[enchanted]] [[dwarf|dwarven]] greatclub that was made using the clutched fist of a [[petrified]] [[ogre]].

==Notable Users==
* The leader of the [[Durang]] tribe wielded a greatclub that was reinforced with both [[iron]] [[nail]]s and the teeth of many beasts.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|37-40|4}}
