Boris was a powerful and sentient magical rapier owned by an adventuring pirate bard in the late 15 century DR.
Boris was a graceful thin rapier with a hilt and guard crafted in a perfect likeness of Boris, the pirate captain who raised Calliope and was her mentor and father figure. Calliope kept the relation between her uncanny sentient weapon and her mentor a secret.
Boris possessed sentience and the voice of the pirate captain. Another enchantment that was placed on Boris allowed the rapier to deal ranged psychic attacks. Upon a successful strike, in melee or at a distance, the rapier could project deadly psychic scream that wounded the targets psyche and continued echoing in their minds, dealing additional psychic damage for the next several minutes.
*Calliope a bard adventurer who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR.
