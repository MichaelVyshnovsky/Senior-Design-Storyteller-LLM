A chime of interruption was a type of small magical chime with an effect designed to disrupt spellcasters.
These chimes emitted a moderate aura of evocation magic.
Once the resonant tone faded, the user would have to wait 7 minutes before they could strike it again. If struck again before this period of rest concluded, the chime of interruption would produce no sound and the rest period would reset, requiring a full 10 minutes to elapse before it could be activated again.
Crafting a chime of interruption required a spellcaster skilled in crafting wondrous items and the spell shout.
* Bandaerl, a dwarven archlich.
* Olonthor the "Minstrel Wyrm" had a chime of interruption in his treasure horde by 1374 DR.
One of the rooms in the Arcane Chambers, the second floor of the infamous dungeon Undermountain, was a regularly flooded complex home to an aboleth that had been imprisoned there by an apprentice of Halaster after some sort of experiment that had occurred prior to 1358 DR. Over time many adventurers fell victim to the room, leaving behind various magical items. By the year 1358 DR, one of the magic items that could be found in the rooms muck was a chime of interruption.
