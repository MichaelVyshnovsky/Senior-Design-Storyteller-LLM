        "mainbody": "The '''''elusive ring''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[ring]] owned by [[Naomlen Girdaur]], a [[dwarven]] [[rogue]] active around [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ring had a [[copper]] band set with a purple [[gemstone]]. It had a very simple design, which even Naomlen could admit despite how much she treasured it.",
        "Powers": "When the wearer of the ''elusive ring'' was attacked, it had a chance to grant them powers to evade their attackers, such as by removing ailments, restoring their mobility, or making them invisible.",
        "History": "Naomlen wore the ring on her quest to reclaim her family's masterworks after they and her family's reputation had been stripped away. She believed that the ring had been crafted by her great-grandmother even before the family had become famous, cementing it as an important memento."
