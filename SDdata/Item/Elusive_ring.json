It had a very simple design, which even Naomlen could admit despite how much she treasured it.\nWhen the wearer of the elusive ring was attacked, it had a chance to grant them powers to evade their attackers, such as by removing ailments, restoring their mobility, or making them invisible.\nNaomlen wore the ring on her quest to reclaim her familys masterworks after they and her familys reputation had been stripped away. She believed that the ring had been crafted by her great-grandmother even before the family had become famous, cementing it as an important memento."
