An Key of the Ancients was a magical circlet that originated from the Emerald Grove.
The circlet was created from partly-fossilised branches taken from trees grown in the Emerald Grove. Several small rubies were embedded in its from, which were uniquely connected to the stones that formed the foundation of the enclave.
The wearer of Key of the Ancients garnered a greater understanding of the natural world.
* Nettie, the apprentice healer of archdruid Master Halsin.
* Findal, an unlucky druid of the Emerald Grove, captured by the goblins of the Cult of the Absolute.
