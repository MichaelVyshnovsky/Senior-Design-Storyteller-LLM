'''Vaervren''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[wild rice]] dish with its name derived from the word ''"vaerve"'' which meant "freshwater shallows," referencing the rice being harvested in such waters.

==Description==
This simple dish began with [[onion]]s and forest [[mushroom]]s sautéed in wild [[boar]] fat until soft, with chopped [[leek]]s added in later. The vegetables were cooked together for a duration of a long elven song and seasoned with [[salt]], [[pepper]], powdered [[marjoram]], [[rosemary]], and [[thyme]]. After this, elven cooks added [[wildfowl broth]] to the vegetables and dried wild rice. The broth was brought up to a rolling boil, covered, and simmered on low heat for fifteen minutes. The rice mix was next taken off the heat and allowed to cool down for five minutes, still covered. Before serving, ''vaervren'' was mixed with heavy [[cream]] and crumbled [[cheese]], preferably [[askata]] or [[Elturian Grey]]. If in a pinch, [[Green Calishite cheese]] was an acceptable option.

Some Fair Folk finished the dish by adding diced [[pear]] or [[quince]].
