        "Description": "''Nays'' were made from dried, shellacked reeds or similar thin flora. Sounds were created by blowing through the main opening and manipulating holes made down the side of the instrument, creating a beautiful and eerie tone. The wonderful sound created by the ''nay'' inspired [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] to call it ''amir al-harab'' which translated from [[Midani]] into \"the prince of the wild wastes.\"",
        "History": "Despite the somewhat eerie sound that conjured thoughts of a haunted desert, the ''nay'' was used almost exclusively by the urban [[Al-Hadhar]]."
