'''Irtios''' was the common name for '''[[wikipedia:en:danburite|danburite]]''' in the Realms. It was found as natural crystals when mined from deep formations, or as tumbled stones in streambeds and among deposits of water-born gravel.{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|18}}

==Description==
This [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] was a hard [[gem|gemstone]] that yielded [[wikipedia:facet|faceted]] gems of middling size. Irtios crystals were pale yellow or colorless and either transparent or translucent. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 [[gp]].

==Powers==
Irtios crystals prevented mold, mildew, and rot from forming on all organic substances, living, dead, or undead, with which they were in continuous direct contact. These gemstones were often mounted on [[sword]] [[sheath]]s and [[wizard]] [[staff|staves]], for example. This protection even worked against [[mummy rot]], [[yellow mold]], and fungus-based diseases, but had to be in direct contact with the skin continuously until the threat was removed.
