        "Powers": "''Netherese axes'' possessed a slight ''+1'' enchantment that aided the wielder with striking the target. Additionally, these ancient weapons granted the wielder limited protection against magic and granted them enhanced concentration and ability to research lore and new spells. This concentration also helped the wielder be more aware of threats.",
        "History": "The design and magics of these axes were thought to originate from the ancient Netheril; however, the creator remained unknown. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one of these ''Netherese axes'' could be found available for sale by one of the exotic weapon vendors in [[Westgate]]'s [[Market Triangle]]."
