The '''''Woven Vine''''' was an [[artifact]] [[enchanted]] [[necklace]] that boosted the wearer's physique.

==Description==
The ''Woven Vine'' was a delicate necklace of woven vines covered in gentle flowers.

==Powers==
When worn, the woven necklace boosted the wearer's ability to land powerful lucky attacks and increased their chances of avoiding incoming damage. In addition, the necklace dramatically increased the wearer's constitution. The ''Woven Vine'' was a part of a set that, when used together, boosted the magics of all items in the set: a ''[[staff of flowers]]'', the ''Woven Vine'', and the ''[[Blooming Cord]]''.

==History==
The ''Woven Vine'' was among many magical treasures hidden deep within the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]] and its [[Wyllowwood]] level.
