        "mainbody": "'''Rock cakes''' were a type of small handfood pastry, which were favored by [[dwarves]] of the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] and [[the Vast]].",
        "History": "Rock cakes were a daily morning staple baked at the [[Downunda Patisserie]] in the [[Crow's End]] District of Ravens Bluff. Plain rock cakes were sold for a single [[silver]] [[coin|piece]]. However, when the fancy struck, [[Jemima Chisolm]], the bakery's cook, whipped out a special batch, smothered in dwarvish liquor icing, which sold for three [[gold]] pieces."
