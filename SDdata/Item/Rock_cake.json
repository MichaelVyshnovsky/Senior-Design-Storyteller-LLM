        "mainbody": "Rock cakes were a type of small handfood pastry, which were favored by dwarves of the city of Ravens Bluff and the Vast.\nRock cakes were a daily morning staple baked at the Downunda Patisserie in the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff. Plain rock cakes were sold for a single silver piece. However, when the fancy struck, Jemima Chisolm, the bakerys cook, whipped out a special batch, smothered in dwarvish liquor icing, which sold for three gold pieces."
