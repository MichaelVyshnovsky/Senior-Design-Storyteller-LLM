        "mainbody": "The Winter Kings Plate was a set of enchanted plate mail made using the body of the Winter King, a ravenous and massive remorhaz of Gloomfrost glacier in Icewind Dale.\nThe armors plates were carved out of the tough and thick hide of the most powerful polar worm to have ever menaced the cold Frozenfar. Unlike other armor of a similar type, the Winter Kings Plate was surprisingly light. The set appeared very unusual and striking in appearance, colored with whites and light blues of the Kings hide.\nThe Winter Kings Plate possessed +3 enchantment and protected the wearer from fire and cold, both mundane and magical.\nThe Winter Kings Plate was created sometime before the  by a blind dwarven smith who inhabited the icy depths of Gloomfrost in Icewind Dale. Blinded by the Seer, Tiernon Denthelm managed to kill the dreaded Winter King upon his first arrival to the black ice glacier. Tiernon created and enchanted the strange white plate mail using the creatures body. As of 1281 DR, the Winter Kings Plate was still in Tiernon Denthelms possession."
