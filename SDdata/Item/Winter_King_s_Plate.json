        "mainbody": "The '''''Winter King's Plate''''' was a set of [[enchanted]] [[plate mail]] made using the body of the [[Winter King]], a ravenous and massive [[remorhaz]] of [[Gloomfrost]] glacier in [[Icewind Dale]].{{Cite dragon+/2/The Winter King}}",
        "Description": "The armor's plates were carved out of the tough and thick hide of the most powerful [[polar worm]] to have ever menaced the cold [[Frozenfar]]. Unlike other armor of a similar type, the ''Winter King's Plate'' was surprisingly light. The set appeared very unusual and striking in appearance, colored with whites and light blues of the King's hide.",
        "Powers": "The ''Winter King's Plate'' possessed ''+3'' enchantment and protected the wearer from fire and cold, both mundane and magical.",
        "History": "The ''Winter King's Plate'' was created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}} by a blind [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith who inhabited the icy depths of [[Gloomfrost]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Blinded by the [[Seer (Gloomfrost)|Seer]], [[Tiernon Denthelm]] managed to kill the dreaded Winter King upon his first arrival to the ''[[black ice]]'' glacier. Tiernon created and enchanted the strange white plate mail using the creature's body. As of [[1281 DR]], the ''Winter King's Plate'' was still in Tiernon Denthelm's possession."
