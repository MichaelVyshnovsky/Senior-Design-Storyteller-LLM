        "mainbody": "Elbixs Stonestick was an enchanted rod was originated from the Elemental Plane of Earth.\nContrary to its bloated reputation, Elbixs Stonestick was a simple rod that held sixteen uses of the stoneskin spell.\nThis rods namesake was Elbix, a gnome apprentice conjurer who managed to summon an elder earth elemental one time. The creature brought Elbixs Stonestick to the Prime Material plane, explained its power, and left it with the gnome. Elbix used the rods story and its greatly exaggerated powers to score free drinks at the local taverns from awe-stricken crowds following that event. With these telltales, Elbixs reputation grew until one day it was tested.\nSeveral years after Stonestick became Elbixs property, the gnome town became menaced by Chief Gnarltooth and his gang of marauding n ettins. The gnome leader summoned Elbix to save the settlement from impending doom. With the conjurers lies swelling the Stonesticks powers to legendary proportions, the towns defenders did not bother to even build defenses against the invading giants. The defenders hoped the rod was to obliterate Gnarltooth with a single use.\nElbix, of course, knew that his lies caught up with him and did not hope to survive when he faced Gnarltooth. The ettin grabbed the terrified gnome. He brought the flailing little creature for a closer look but accidentally received Stonestick right in the eye. Gnarltoothtripped backward and impaled himself on his own spear, dying instantly. With their leader defeated, ettins fled. Elbixs uncanny luck saved his life and intended to remain alive, so he tossed the Stonestick into the closest river.\nElbixs Stonestick eventually ended up in possession of Boonmoppets master. The wizard, and later a lich, was killed before 1372 DR, leaving his tower and his magical goods in the hands of the lonely imp familiar."
