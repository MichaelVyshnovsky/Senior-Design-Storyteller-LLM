The Twig was a simple-looking wooden stick, enchanted to be a dangerous wizardly wand that originated from the city of Wheloon.
The Twig was imbued with powerful fire magics, allowing the user to cast combust spell at will. Fully charged, the Twig held twenty-one charges.
The Twig came into possession of Wheloons militia after a raid on a smugglers den sometime before 1372 DR. The den was located just outside of the city. It was defended by only one middle-aged man, perched on top of a pile of stolen goods. The man disregarded the guards and cheerily tapped out a melody with a simple wooden stick, hitting barrels and boxes all around him. When he was called out, the man refused to surrender, while the militia made jokes about how the man was about to fight them with nothing but a thin, flimsy stick. The next thing that happened was the man raising the Twig and immolating the entire unit. Eventually, the man and the Twig were overpowered, and the militia confiscated the wand. Later, the story of the magic item was retold many times by Wheloons guards.
Bu 1372 DR, the Twig could be found among the junk and antiques in Torleths Treasures of Gillians Hill.
