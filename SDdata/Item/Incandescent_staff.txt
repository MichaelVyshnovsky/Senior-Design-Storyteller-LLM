'''''Incandescent staff''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] imbued with the [[elemental]] magics of fire.

==Description==
The entire length of an ''incandescent staff'' was etched with the [[Primordial script]] of fire that coursed with fire-red radiance.

==Powers==
These very rare magical weapons possessed a ''+1'' enchantment to their aim and damage that allowed the wielder to use it with the same efficiency against creatures typically resistant to bludgeoning or non-magical damage. An ''incandescent staff'' also granted them resistance to magical and mundane flame and improved their spellcasting aim. Lastly, the wielder could cast the ''[[fire bolt]]'' [[cantrip]] at will and the ''[[fireball]]'' [[spell]] once per day, using the staff's magic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one such staff was in stock of [[Talli]], a [[Harper]] quartermaster who followed the [[druid]] Harper hero [[Jaheira]] into the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
