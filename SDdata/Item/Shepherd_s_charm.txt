'''''Shepherd's charms''''' were minor [[enchanted]] [[lens]]es used by some of the shepherds of the [[Wild Pastures]] of [[Liam's Hold]].

==Description==
This magic item was a small broken piece of glass that formed a lens, tied to a shabby handle made out of wood.

==Powers==
Humble in their appearance, these items could create ''[[light]]'' once per day and, when looked through the lens, could ''[[detect invisibility]]'' once per day.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], a ''shepherd's charm'' belonged to a young shepherd from the Wild Pastures. She believed that the dreaded [[Old One-Eye]] was behind the disappearances of her cattle, even though no-one believed her. The shepherd, named [[Lavna]], offered the magic trinket to anyone brave enough to slay the [[worg]] and bring her his head.
