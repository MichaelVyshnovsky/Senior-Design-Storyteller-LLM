Shepherds charms were minor enchanted lenses used by some of the shepherds of the Wild Pastures of Liams Hold.
This magic item was a small broken piece of glass that formed a lens, tied to a shabby handle made out of wood.
Humble in their appearance, these items could create light once per day and, when looked through the lens, could detect invisibility once per day.
In 1372 DR, a shepherds charm belonged to a young shepherd from the Wild Pastures. She believed that the dreaded Old One-Eye was behind the disappearances of her cattle, even though no-one believed her. The shepherd, named Lavna, offered the magic trinket to anyone brave enough to slay the worg and bring her his head.
