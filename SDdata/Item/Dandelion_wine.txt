Darkhold Vale, Far Hills
Dandelion wine was a type of fermented alcoholic drink prepared using the dandelion flowering plant. The drink was a rare sight outside of several areas where it was made.
Fine dandelion wine was created by the halflings of Amn, notably, the area around Burrowville. Inhabitants of the Darkhold Vale in the Far Hills had perfected the recipe for dandelion wine and were known to produce it as long as anyone could remember. By the late 15 century DR, dandelion wine from Darkhold started gaining popularity thanks to trade.
