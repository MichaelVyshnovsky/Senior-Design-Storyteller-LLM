'''Togas''' were a type of light, wraparound outerwear garment.

==Description==
Togas were woven from a variety of materials, including [[linen]], [[wool]], [[velvet]], and [[silk]]. ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold both linen and wool togas, as well as ones that were custom-made with concealed pockets for hiding things in, such as [[stiletto]]s.

==History==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], togas sold through ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue''&mdash;which had been imported from the [[Old Empires]]&mdash;steadily became extremely popular among inhabitants of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Notable Users of Togas==
===Classes===
* [[Chessentan]] [[warrior]]s often preferred to wear a short toga in place of armor, as doing so was less hot and allowed them a greater freedom of movement.
===Nations, Regions, and Settlements===
* People in the nations known collectively as the Old Empires&mdash;[[Chessenta]], [[Mulhorand]], and [[Unther]]&mdash;were sometimes known to wear togas.
* Togas were a common article of clothing among inhabitants of the [[Malatran Plateau]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/Heroes of Malatra|14}} Among the native [[Nubari]] tribe called the [[Rudra]], white togas were reserved for the most prestigious of people. All other members of the tribe could only wear togas if they were of a red or brown color.{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|10}}
* Throughout the city-states of the [[Vilhon Reach]], it was a common custom for [[priest]]s, regardless of their faith, to wear togas that were dyed blue. Similarly, [[wizard]]s in this region were known to often wear togas that had been dyed red.
