Forgotten Light was a powerful magical heavy mace found in the ruins of Beckside Castle in the mid-1480s DR.
The mace exuded a bright white glow from its head, and instilled a broad feeling of peace and safety in those around it.
Forgotten Light was strongly aligned to the forces of good, allowing it to smite evil more effectively in addition to weakening evildoers that tried to use it. It also powerfully magnified divine spells, especially those that healed, produced light, or smote evil.
The artifact was already ancient by the 15 century DR, and it was found in the collapsed chambers of Beckside Castle (fallen in the Goblin Wars) when Harper agents fought the Netherese arcanist Gaston Wyrst for a piece of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll hidden there.
