'''Sharpstone''', also known as '''[[wikipedia:en:novaculite|novaculite]]''', was a [[wikipedia:en:quartz|quartz]] variety that occurred in various colors.

==Description==
This stone was usually gritty and its major use was for sharpening. Occasionally the grit was fine enough to make large cabochon [[ornamental stones]]. Sharpstone's hardness made it difficult to polish to full luster.

==Powers==
This stone could be used to increase the area of effect of a spell with a corresponding decrease in damage (or duration if the spell did not have a damage effect). Any size or amount of sharpstone could be used and was consumed in the casting.
