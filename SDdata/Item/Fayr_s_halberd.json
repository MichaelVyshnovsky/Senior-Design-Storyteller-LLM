        "History": "''Fayr's halberd'' made a name for itself being wielded by Bedwyn Fayr. His adventuring company employed clever tactics of sending [[dwarf]] and [[halfling]] members into close combat while taller adventurers used halberds and [[bow]]s from a distance. The group was active through the early parts of the 13{{th}} century DR until the group was almost killed in [[1252 DR]]. The company's two survivors, Fayr and [[Pep Greenfields]] retired their adventuring mantles and opened an antique shop in Waterdeep.\n\nThirty years later, by [[1281 DR]], ''Fayr's halberd'' found its way into the stock of ''[[Conlan's Smithy]]'' in [[Kuldahar]] in [[Icewind Dale]]."
