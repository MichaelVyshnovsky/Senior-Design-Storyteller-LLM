'''''Icy burst''''' was a [[weapon quality]] that, when applied to a ''[[frost]]'' [[weapon]], would cause it to release a burst of ice when it critically hit.

==Powers==
Weapons with the ''icy burst'' weapon quality would cause more damage to opponents when they were critically hit, provided the opponent wasn't immune to cold damage. If a user fought at range with a icy burst-imbued [[crossbow]] or [[longbow]], the ammunition also carried the property.

==Creation==
The creator must have used ''[[chill metal]]'', or ''[[ice storm]]'' to add the property to a weapon.

==Uses==
Some veteran [[Thayan gladiator]]s had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as ''icy burst'' weapons.
