Icy burst was a weapon quality that, when applied to a frost weapon, would cause it to release a burst of ice when it critically hit.
Weapons with the icy burst weapon quality would cause more damage to opponents when they were critically hit, provided the opponent wasnt immune to cold damage. If a user fought at range with a icy burst-imbued crossbow or longbow, the ammunition also carried the property.
The creator must have used chill metal, or ice storm to add the property to a weapon.
Some veteran Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as icy burst weapons.
