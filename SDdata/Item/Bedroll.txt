A '''bedroll''' was a padded sack that allowed a person to sleep while traveling in the wilderness. It kept the occupant dry and warm.

==Description==
A typical bedroll consisted of a sack that could contain a [[human]]-sized creature, with an opening on the side. Some variants consisted of several layers to provide waterproofing, warmth, and comfort.

Special heavy-duty bedrolls were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', which contained an outer layer of leather and an inner layer of [[Maztica]]n cotton. Winter variants also had an additional layer of wool padding for extra warmth.
