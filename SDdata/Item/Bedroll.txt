A bedroll was a padded sack that allowed a person to sleep while traveling in the wilderness. It kept the occupant dry and warm.
A typical bedroll consisted of a sack that could contain a human-sized creature, with an opening on the side. Some variants consisted of several layers to provide waterproofing, warmth, and comfort.
Special heavy-duty bedrolls were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, which contained an outer layer of leather and an inner layer of Maztican cotton. Winter variants also had an additional layer of wool padding for extra warmth.
