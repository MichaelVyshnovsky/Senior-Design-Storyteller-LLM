Since then that stone changed many owners, including hunters, weavers, and even one especially narcissistic [[harp]]ist. By 1281 DR, this ''deep red ioun stones'' was in possession of an evil [[necromancer]] [[Presio]] who served [[Yxunomei]] in her lair within the  [[Dragon's Eye]]on the [[Spine of the World]]. After Presio's death, the ''stone'' was picked up by the heroes of [[Icewind Dale]].\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], a ''deep red ioun stone'' could be found within a deadly [[ghost]]-infested ruined [[Valhingen Graveyard]] of [[Old Phlan]].",
