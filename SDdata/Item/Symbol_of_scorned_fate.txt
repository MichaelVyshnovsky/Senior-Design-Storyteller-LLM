'''''Symbols of scorned fate''''' were special types of [[Tymora]]n [[holy symbol]]s of various power levels imbued with the Lady Luck's [[divine]] magics. These symbols first started being used by the [[Church of Tymora]] post-[[Spellplague]].

==Description==
''Symbols of scorned fate'' were shaped like double-headed [[coin]]s.

==Powers==
These holy symbols were enchanted to allow their wielders to elude fate for a split second. When the owner of a ''symbol of scorned fate'' was affected by a spell effect, the double-headed coin's magic was activated. It protected the owner from said negative effect for a short period of time, thus cheating fate. This power needed some time to recharge. Additionally, these magic coins enchanted the wielder's combat prowess, by improving their aim and damage output. Additionally, the wielder seared the targets of their strikes with Tymora's divine radiance.
