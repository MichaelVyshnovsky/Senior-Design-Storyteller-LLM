Edwins elixirs were magic potions that commemorated the defeat of Gorgomorz, Daggerfords Devil by Duke Edwin Daggerford circa 1270 DR.
Edwins elixir was a white and shivering liquid.
Edwins elixirs, when consumed, dramatically increased the imbibers charisma, making them an inspirational leader healed minor wounds and boosted the morale, making them unafraid of the terrifying and powerful devils that exuded terror. The effect of the potion was similar to the aura of glory spell.
Edwins elixir, along with a few other items, was created in celebration of Duke Edwins triumph over the terrible and murderous Gorgomorz circa 1270 DR. These items also commemorated the young Dukes death from the battle injuries. Edwins elixir was named after Duke Edwin Daggerford and provided aid to the future heroes that were to face the devils that spewed from Dragonspear Castle through the years that followed.
In 1372 DR, Edwins elixirs were available from the Moonglow Tower, the temple of Lathander in Daggerford.
