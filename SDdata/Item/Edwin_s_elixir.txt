'''''Edwin's elixirs''''' were magic [[potion]]s that commemorated the defeat of [[Gorgomorz]], [[Daggerford]]'s [[Devil]] by Duke [[Edwin Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1270 DR]].

==Description==
''Edwin's elixir'' was a white and shivering liquid.

==Powers==
''Edwin's elixirs'', when consumed, dramatically increased the imbiber's charisma, making them an inspirational leader; healed minor wounds; and boosted the morale, making them unafraid of the terrifying and powerful devils that exuded terror. The effect of the potion was similar to the ''[[aura of glory]]'' spell.

==History==
''Edwin's elixir'', along with a few other items, was created in celebration of Duke Edwin's triumph over the terrible and murderous Gorgomorz ''circa'' 1270 DR. These items also commemorated the young Duke's death from the battle injuries. Edwin's elixir was named after Duke Edwin Daggerford and provided aid to the future heroes that were to face the devils that spewed from [[Dragonspear Castle]] through the years that followed.

In [[1372 DR]], ''Edwin's elixirs'' were available from the [[Moonglow Tower]], the temple of [[Lathander]] in Daggerford.
