'''Burdym's Best''' was a drink in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Availability==
The drink was available in [[Nethrar]] in the 760s [[DR]]. There was at least one keg at the royal cellars in the [[House of the Unicorn]].

==History==
In the late {{yearlinkName|764}}, the [[Chosen of Mystra]] and Court Mage of [[Galadorna]], [[Elminster Aumar]], gave a keg of Burdym's Best, drawn from the royal cellar, to the Watch Captain [[Rhoagalow]] after the latter brought word of yet another knifing, one in which the victim may yet live. He told him to go somewhere safe and out of uniform to drink it, strongly implying he intended to wipe the man's memory.
