The '''Sword of Selvetarm''' was an intelligent holy sword of [[Selvetarm]]'s church.

==Properties==
The sword's properties changed depending on who wielded it. Its true potential was only usable by evil [[drow]].

===Evil people in general===
In the hands of an evil person, who wasn't a [[drow]], it worked as a simple ''+2 longsword''. The sword's intelligence tried to dominate the non-drow wielder into working for [[Lolth]] and [[Selvetarm]].

===Non-evil people===
In the hands of any person who wasn't evil, the sword was outright dangerous. It stunted the wielder's vitality, killing those too weak, which was impossible to restore as long as the owner clung to the sword.

===Evil drow===
In the hands of an evil drow, the sword showed its true potential. It worked as a ''+5 [[Bane (property)|elf bane]] [[unholy]] [[vorpal]] [[longsword]]'' with a large amount of additional powers bestowed on the user, both physical and magical.

On the physical side, the sword heightened the wielder's agility and abilities to hide. Furthermore, the wielder could rage like a [[barbarian]].

On the magical side, the sword allowed the casting of ''[[spider climb]]'' and ''[[web]]'' as often as the user wanted and of ''[[fire spider]]'' once every day. Once per month, the user could summon a [[yochlol]], who opened a channel to ''[[commune]]'' with [[Lolth]] or [[Selvetarm]].

===The sword's intelligence===
The ''Sword of Selvetarm'' was an intelligent weapon. It couldn't actually talk, barring telepathy, but it could shout [[Selvetarm]]'s name during any battle.

It generally hated to be not used in a battle and actively urged its owner to enter the fray.

==Creation==
The sword was created by [[Selvetarm]], the [[drow]] [[demigod]] of warriors. The ''Sword of Selvetarm'' was created as a tool to promote [[Lolth]]'s agenda,

It was a [[longsword]] instead of a [[heavy mace]] like his actual favored weapon, because it was made to strengthen that branch of drow warriors, that trained in the usage of two-handed weapons.

By [[1372 DR]], the sword was lost for decades but its recovery was believed to be a matter of time.

==Destruction==
The sword was difficult to destroy. The only way to destroy it was to bring it into the [[Demonweb Pits]] and hurt either [[Lolth]] or [[Selvetarm]] with it.
