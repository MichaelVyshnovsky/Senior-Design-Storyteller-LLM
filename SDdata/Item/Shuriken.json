It inflicted small piercing injuries. Their effective range was quite short typically .\nOwing to their small size, shuriken were easy to conceal, being tucked within sashes or folds of clothing. The spike shuriken could even be worn as a pin in the hair.\nThe shuriken was an exotic weapon that required special training to use effectively. It was commonly wielded by monks, who could use it with their special martial arts techniques.
