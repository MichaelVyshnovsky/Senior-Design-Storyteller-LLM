        "mainbody": "tantan, known as a tambourine on other worlds, was a type of percussion instrument.The tantan appears to bear no relation to the tan-tan, a large drum from Brazil.\nTantans consisted of jangling hoops that were used to emphasize rhythms in ensembles and to enhance campfire dances.\nTantans crafted by the masters of the plains of the Hordelands and traded through Semphar were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue states that the tantans are made by \"the masters of the plains\" and come from \"the long trade routes from Semphar\" (not necessarily Semphar itself). It is unclear who these masters are and what plains are being referred to, but the most notable plains beyond Semphar are those of the Hordelands.\n* Adagio Jones, a member of the bardic group Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds, had a tantan that he played to keep time with soft songs.\n* Swen Sigirdson, a traveling entertainer in the Vast, sometimes played a tantan as part of a small group of musicians.\n* They were popular instrument among the humans and halflings who lived south of the Dalelands.\n* Tantans were quite popular among the people of the Hordelands."
