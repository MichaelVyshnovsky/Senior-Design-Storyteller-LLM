A ring of energy immunity, or a ring of elemental immunity, was a ring that, when worn, granted complete immunity to a single type of energy acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
These epic rings were essentially bands made of adamantine, and had a market price of about 240,000 gp.
Whilst worn, these adamantine rings provided continual immunity to a single type of elemental energy.
In order to craft a ring of such power, a very skilled crafter and mage had to be able to cast protection from elements.

* Kimarr of Taydomes Keep in Thar owned a ring of electrical immunity
