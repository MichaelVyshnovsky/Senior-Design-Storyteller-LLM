        "Description": "The orb was carved from crystal that had a deep purple color.",
        "Powers": "The orb's primary use was in stealing life force from an injured victim and giving it to the wielder as magical energy. Thus, a caster could remain refreshed as long as they could keep physically striking a target. Less obviously, it granted a measure of protection against all sorts of hostile effects, especially elemental threats, and made the wielder's spells a little more deadly.",
        "History": "The orb was used by Netherese forces led by the [[arcanist]] [[Shai]] when she and Archwizard [[Amskar]] captured the meddling [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]] at [[Yarrow Glade]] in the [[Storm Horns]]. The ambush was broken by Oriphaun's allies, who defeated Shai and her group, and captured the orb in the process."
