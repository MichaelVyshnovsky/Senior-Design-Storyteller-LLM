        "mainbody": "The '''''Cauldron of Doom''''' was a unique [[magic]]al cauldron of [[necromancy|necromantic]] power.",
        "Powers": "The cauldron was used to animate [[human]] corpses as [[undead]]. When a human body was placed inside it, the corpse would be revived as an undead monster similar to a [[zombie]] but twice as strong and harder to hit in combat. The zombie was under the control of the one who threw it in, and with no apparent limitation on the cauldron's frequency of use, its user could raise an army of darkness in relatively little time.",
        "History": "The cauldron was fashioned in ancient times by a blacksmith under the guidance of [[Kazgaroth]]. As of [[1357 DR]], it was thought to be located in the [[Castle of Skulls]] in [[Llyrath Forest]] on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in [[Moonshae Isles|Moonshae]]."
