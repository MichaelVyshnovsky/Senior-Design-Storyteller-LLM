'''''Boots of relentless motion''''' were [[enchanted]] [[boots]] created by [[Coriolis Rillevay]] in [[Waterdeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''boots of relentless motion'' were once mundane boots more fit for a laborer than a [[sorcerer]], but Coriolis restored and refurbished them, ultimately making them tools that would help her overcome anything that stood between her and her goals.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ''boots of relentless motion'' could move faster, both travelling further and acting or attacking faster than normal.

==Notable Owners==
* Coriolis , a [[gnome]] sorcerer who worked as an [[adventurer]] on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
