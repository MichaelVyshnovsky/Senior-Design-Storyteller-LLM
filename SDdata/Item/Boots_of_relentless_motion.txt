Boots of relentless motion were enchanted boots created by Coriolis Rillevay in Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR.
The boots of relentless motion were once mundane boots more fit for a laborer than a sorcerer, but Coriolis restored and refurbished them, ultimately making them tools that would help her overcome anything that stood between her and her goals.
The wearer of the boots of relentless motion could move faster, both travelling further and acting or attacking faster than normal.
* Coriolis , a gnome sorcerer who worked as an adventurer on behalf of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, during the late 15 century DR.
