'''Westgate Ruby''' was a [[wine]] exported from [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was also sold through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].

==Description==
This bold crimson wine had a slight acidity that was considered refreshing. It was complimented best when served with beef or a hearty stew.

==Prices==
Westgate Ruby could be purchased from Aurora's in the following containers:
* Hand keg: 3 [[sp]]
* Cask: 13 sp
* Barrel: 3 [[gp]]
* Butt: 10 gp
* Tun: 25 gp

==Availability==
As one of the more popular and common drinks, It was also found at the [[Unicorn's Pool]] in [[Kirinwood]], [[Cormyr]] and [[Zhentil Keep]].

==History==
[[Mirt]] drunk Westgate Ruby straight from the bottle when he relaxed with [[Oelaerone]] and [[Belarla]] at their home in Zhentil Keep, whilst sheltering [[Shandril Shessair]]. However, he ended up spluttering it down his front when he saw Shandril leave in a hurry.

In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, in [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]], [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]] ordered a butt of Westgate Ruby from [[Shortshanks]] of the [[Bold Bard]] tavern. He swore it was the ''only'' wine to drink with the [[Beef and Oysters Barnabas]] he'd planned for the welcoming dinner at the upcoming Grand Council of the [[Merchants' Guild]]. He nagged him about it on [[Eleint 16]]; Shortshanks quietly proposed something else Barthelm might drink instead.
