        "Description": "A siangham looked like a heavy metal [[arrow]] with a hilt or handle where the feathers would be. It had a piercing tip. An average siangham cost 3 [[gp]], weighed {{SI|1|lb}} and was about {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} in length. It took special training to use a siangham in melee combat, therefore it was considered an exotic weapon.\n\nIn Kara-Tur, it was primarily used by [[wu jen]].",
