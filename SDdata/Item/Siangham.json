        "mainbody": "A siangham, also known as a siangkam\nA siangham looked like a heavy metal arrow with a hilt or handle where the feathers would be. It had a piercing tip. An average siangham cost 3 gp, weighed  and was about  in length. It took special training to use a siangham in melee combat, therefore it was considered an exotic weapon.\nIn Kara-Tur, it was primarily used by wu jen.\n* Rowan Silvercrown"
