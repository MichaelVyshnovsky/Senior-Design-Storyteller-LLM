Elven ceremonial armor was a type of traditional enchanted plate mail, crafted and used by the surface Fair Folk, dating several generations before 1372 DR.
Enhanced with +1 enchantment, these sets of mail, granted the wearer uncanny focus when casting conjuration, divination, enchantment, and evocation spells.
Even though majority of elves prefer wearing light armor sets such as elven chainmails, these ceremonial plates were masterfully crafted and offered solid defense. By late 14 century DR, elven ceremonial armor could be found on the Sword Coast as well as the Moonsea regions.
