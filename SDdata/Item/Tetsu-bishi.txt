'''Tetsu-bishi''' were weapons unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Tetsu-bishi were small [[caltrop]]s used by [[ninja]]s. Each tetsu-bishi was designed as a spiked ball or four-sided diamond about {{SI|2|in|c|long=yes}} wide, ensuring that, no matter how it landed, at least one spike pointed upwards. These devices were strategically deployed on the ground to create a highly treacherous walking surface, effectively impeding or slowing the movement of both individuals and animals. Their design rendered them ineffective when thrown directly at opponents. Instead, tetsu-bishi were cast onto the ground near pursuers, allowing the ninja to swiftly escape.
