Fehlls reputation brought a small army of rivals and enemies, all of whom wanted to get their hands on the thiefs enchanted knife. Eventually, Fehll Brownbriars was killed by a clever seductress who warmed her way to his heart and ended his life, to the thiefs great surprise. The seductresss name was Prespera of Orlumbor, who claimed the coveted dagger and sold it to the highest bidder. After that, the Lover disappeared into the roll of years until it reappeared once again in the , among the hoards of treasures inside the temple dedicated to Icasaracht the white dragon on the island in Lac Dinneshere."
