'''Litchi''' was an exotic fruit from [[Shou Lung]].

==Description==
The unusual fruit was very sweet and tender and was usually served in the courts of Shou Lung.

==Availability==
Beyond Shou Lung itself, places in the Realms where one could find litchi included the following:
* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold litchi in both a dried form, resembling [[Imnescarian date]]s, and preserved in syrup, in order to retain some of its fresh properties.
* In [[Marsember/Xiousing|Xiousing]], a small [[Shou]] district in the city of [[Marsember]], litchi was grown by [[Shen's Herb Garden]] under the name wolfberry.{{Cite dungeon/195/Backdrop: Xiousing|6}}

==Usages==
* Some used litchi in the making of [[incense]].
* Some were known to cultivate litchi for medicinal purposes.
* Litchi could be used to make [[tea]].
