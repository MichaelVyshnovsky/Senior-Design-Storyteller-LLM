Beyond Shou Lung itself, places in the Realms where one could find litchi included the following
* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold litchi in both a dried form, resembling Imnescarian dates, and preserved in syrup, in order to retain some of its fresh properties.
* In Xiousing, a small Shou district in the city of Marsember, litchi was grown by Shens Herb Garden under the name wolfberry.
* Some used litchi in the making of incense.
* Some were known to cultivate litchi for medicinal purposes.
* Litchi could be used to make tea.
