'''''Anklets of sure footing''''' were magical pairs of [[anklet]]s woven from [[kelp]]. They were designed to give wearers steady footing on ships, even in the most turbulent seas.

==Powers==
Wearers of ''anklets of sure footing'' gained a balanced stance aboard any ship, even when buffeted with huge waves or extreme wind. This balance persisted even when walking around the deck, and enabled spellcasting uninterrupted by any sudden movements of the vessel. Additionally, wearers were able to climb a ship's rigging as easily as they could walk, and could even cast spells from up in the ropes as easily as on solid ground.

The magical effects of the ''anklets'' only functioned when both were worn simultaneously, uncovered by footwear or cloth.

==History==
Sages generally held that the ''anklets of sure footing'' were first created by a [[wizard]] who served aboard a pirate ship from the [[Corsair Domains]], as a way to alleviate his troubles with casting spells on the swaying vessel.

==Reputation==
While potentially useful for just about anyone who traveled by ship, ''anklets of sure footing'' were especially sought after by [[rogue]]s and [[spellcaster]]s that took to the seas.
