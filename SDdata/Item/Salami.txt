'''Salami''' was a type of preserved [[sausage]] found in the [[Western Heartlands]], the [[Chionthar Valley]], and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
Salami sausages were popular among adventurers due to their delicious taste and shelf-life. Some of these big sausages were so well-preserved and hardened they could be used as bludgeoning weapons, tough enough to knock a creature out cold.
