'''Observation kits''' were sets of tools used by [[thieves]] and [[rogue]]s that aided them in trap disarming, popularized in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
A typical observation kit was a collection of [[lens]]es, powders, and other implements that aided rogues in detection and disarming of traps. Using such kits also greatly improved their skills in thievery and boosted their perception.

==History==
Such observation kits were used by thieves who worked for the bandit leader named [[Desram]] who operated in the [[Sword Mountains]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Orc raiders of the [[Ash Ridge]] were known to carry these sets, as well as [[undead]] servants of the [[vampire lord]] [[Ozit]] who laired in the ruins of [[Illefarn]].
