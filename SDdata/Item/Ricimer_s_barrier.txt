The '''''Ricimer's barrier''''' was an enchanted [[shield]], that could be found in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Ricimer's barrier'' was simple looking small shield with a sharp spike perturbing from its middle designed to damage its target when shield-bashing.

==Powers==
Apart from the obvious offensive ''+3'' enchantment to the shield's spike, it served as a small but capable ''+2'' enchanted [[buckler]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], during the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s occupation of Myth Drannor, ''Ricimer's barrier'' could be found in possession of hungry [[margoyle]]s who hunted in [[Windrider Glade]], who plucked the magical item off one of their preys.
