        "Description": "''Fire Knife medallions'' were small [[silver]] disks with an etching of a downward [[stiletto]], the symbol of the infamous assassins' guild. These medallions were worn underneath clothes by the assassins of the guild and shown only to other members of their deadly organization. They were used as a method of identification.",
        "Powers": "These items possessed enchantments that aided assassins in their illicit activities. They magically improved the wearers' trap-making and trap disabling skills and allowed them to use the ''[[flare]]'' spell at will. ''Fire Knife medallions'' were enchanted only to be used by [[rogue]]s and [[assassin]]s."
