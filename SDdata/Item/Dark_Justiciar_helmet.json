        "mainbody": "'''''Dark Justiciar helmets''''' were [[enchanted]] [[helmet]]s worn by the elite order of [[Sharran]] servants in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "These magic helms were a part of the [[Dark Justiciars|Dark Justiciar]] uniform. They were decorated with a fanned spiked coronet resembling a halo around the Justiciar's head. The helmets' front was a mask of a face frozen in grim and stiff-lipped intent to frighten and intimidate those who looked upon the Justiciars.",
        "Powers": "Apart from intimidation and protection, ''Dark Justiciar helmets'' were enchanted to protect the wearers from [[spell]]s and boost their constitution. Additionally, when the wearer was obscured by shadow or darkness, the helmets' magic made it easier for the wearer to land praise and devastating attacks.",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Dark Justiciars'' were trained in a massive subterranean temple dedicated to the Lady of Loss underneath the town of [[Reithwin]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. This [[Gauntlet of Shar]] was ruined and its inhabitants slaughtered by a servant of a powerful [[cambion]] spawn of [[Mephistopheles]] named [[Raphael]] by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. A single enchanted ''Dark Justiciar helmet'' was still hidden within the Gauntlet, along with a set of ''[[Dark Justiciar half-plate]]'', waiting for a new worshipper of the Lady of Loss to pass the trails and become a new Dark Justiciar."
