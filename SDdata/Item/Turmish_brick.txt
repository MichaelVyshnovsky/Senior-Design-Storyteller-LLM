'''Turmish brick'''  was a [[cheese]] crafted in [[Turmish]]. It was also sold through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].

==Description==
A heavy red local [[wine]] lent this crumbly cheese its reddish color and a sweet taste. Unlike the wine used to make it, this cheese traveled well and was popular as far away as [[Neverwinter]]. It was much denser and heavier than other wine-based cheeses, such as [[Vilhon blanc]].

==Production==
The cheese was produced and ripened in large platters. Individual bricks were then carved and wrapped in red wax.

==Prices==
Turmish brick could be purchased in the following sizes:
* Rectangular loaf, 1 lb. (0.45 kg.) 4 [[sp]]
* Cubic whey, 1000 lbs. (43.6 kg.) 35 [[gp]]
