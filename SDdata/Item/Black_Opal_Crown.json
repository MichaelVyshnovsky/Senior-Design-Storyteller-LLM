        "mainbody": "he Black Opal Crown was a supposedly magical artifact from ancient Netheril that was said to reflect the evil of humanity within its jewel.\nBefitting its name, the golden crown featured a large, glimmering opal upon its band.\nSome yuan-ti believed that the Black Opal Crown possessed the ability to awaken Dendar the Night Serpent from her slumber.\nThe crown originally belonged to the archmage Sadamor of Netheril. When he gazed into its opal, he came to witness how truly malevolent humankind could become, and created a massive sphere of annihilation to swallow all of Toril. He was unsuccessful in his efforts, and the sphere claimed his life instead.\nAt some point in its existence, the lich Acererak transferred the Black Opal Crown to the Tomb of the Nine Gods in Chult, and placed it upon a pedestal within the Chambers of Horror level.\nSometime during or before the late 15 century DR, the yuan-ti malison Fenthaza began receiving prophetic dreams regarding the Black Opal Crown. She came to learn of its resting place within the Tomb, and believed it to be the sole means by which to release Dendar upon the world. They sought to transport it to the nearby Peaks of Flame mountains,\nCertain walls of the Hall of Serpents within the Fane of the Night Serpent depicted scenes of Ras Nsi wearing the Black Opal Crown, leading the yuan-ti on the quest to free Dendar.\nWhile the crown was worth approximately 5,000 gold pieces to most people, it was believed that some collectors would pay upwards of 20,000 gold pieces."
