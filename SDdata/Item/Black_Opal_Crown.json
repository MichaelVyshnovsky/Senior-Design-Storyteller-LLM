        "mainbody": "The '''''Black Opal Crown''''' was a supposedly [[magic]]al [[artifact]] from ancient [[Netheril]] that was said to reflect the [[evil]] of humanity within its jewel.",
        "Description": "Befitting its name, the [[gold]]en crown featured a large, glimmering [[opal]] upon its band.",
        "Powers": "Some [[yuan-ti]] believed that the ''Black Opal Crown'' possessed the ability to awaken [[Dendar]] the Night Serpent from her slumber.",
        "History": "The crown originally belonged to the [[archmage]] [[Sadamor]] of Netheril. When he gazed into its [[opal]], he came to witness how truly malevolent humankind could become, and created a massive ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' to swallow all of [[Toril]]. He was unsuccessful in his efforts, and the ''sphere'' claimed his life instead.\n\nAt some point in its existence, the [[lich]] [[Acererak]] transferred the ''Black Opal Crown'' to the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] in [[Chult]], and placed it upon a pedestal within the [[Chambers of Horror]] level.\n\nSometime during or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[yuan-ti malison]] [[Fenthaza]] began receiving prophetic dreams regarding the ''Black Opal Crown''. She came to learn of its resting place within the Tomb, and believed it to be the sole means by which to release Dendar upon the world. They sought to transport it to the nearby [[Peaks of Flame]] mountains,",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Certain walls of the Hall of Serpents within the [[Fane of the Night Serpent]] depicted scenes of [[Ras Nsi]] wearing the ''Black Opal Crown'', leading the yuan-ti on the quest to free Dendar.\n\nWhile the crown was worth approximately 5,000 [[gp|gold pieces]] to most people, it was believed that some collectors would pay upwards of 20,000 gold pieces."
