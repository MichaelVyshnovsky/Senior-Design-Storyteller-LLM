'''''Stonespeaker crystals''''' were a variety of [[magic]]al crystal formations associated with the library of [[Gravenhollow]] in the [[Underdark]]. They were constructed by the library's [[stone giant]] attendants. 

==Description==
The ''stonespeaker crystals'' each comprised a piece of [[quartz]], {{SI|19|in|c|long=yes}} in length.

They emanated strong auras of [[conjuration]] and [[divination]] magic.

==Powers==
While in someone's possession, a ''stonespeaker crystal'' granted them increased insight when investigating any subject matter. Each crystal possessed ten charges with which to create certain magical effects, a number of which were replenished each day.

It could be used to cast spells that allowed the wielder to speak with different living (or once-living) beings, including ''[[speak with animals|animals]]'', ''[[speak with plants|plants]]'', and ''[[speak with dead|the dead]]''.

Anyone that attuned to one of these crystals would be receptive to visions of events that played out in the past, were currently ongoing, or could happen in the future. The effects of the crystal differed, depending on whether the attuned individual was within Gravenhollow's Archives of the Past, Present, or Future.

''Stonespeaker crystals'' could be used in lieu of [[material component]]s when casting divination spells, at the cost of its charges.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s traveled to Gravenhollow and utilized ''stonespeaker crystals'' to garner more insight about the ongoing schemes of the recently released [[demon lord]]s of the [[Abyss]].
