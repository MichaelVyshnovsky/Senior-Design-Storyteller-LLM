Stonespeaker crystals were a variety of magical crystal formations associated with the library of Gravenhollow in the Underdark. They were constructed by the librarys stone giant attendants. 
The stonespeaker crystals each comprised a piece of quartz,  in length.
They emanated strong auras of conjuration and divination magic.
While in someones possession, a stonespeaker crystal granted them increased insight when investigating any subject matter. Each crystal possessed ten charges with which to create certain magical effects, a number of which were replenished each day.
It could be used to cast spells that allowed the wielder to speak with different living (or once-living) beings, including animals, plants, and the dead.
Anyone that attuned to one of these crystals would be receptive to visions of events that played out in the past, were currently ongoing, or could happen in the future. The effects of the crystal differed, depending on whether the attuned individual was within Gravenhollows Archives of the Past, Present, or Future.
Stonespeaker crystals could be used in lieu of material components when casting divination spells, at the cost of its charges.
In the late 15 century DR, a group of adventurers traveled to Gravenhollow and utilized stonespeaker crystals to garner more insight about the ongoing schemes of the recently released demon lords of the Abyss.
