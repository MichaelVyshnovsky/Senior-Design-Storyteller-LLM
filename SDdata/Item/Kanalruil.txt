Kanalruil was an enchanted sword that was once carried by the elf heroine Ytharra.
Kanalruils blade was forged from blue steel covered with silver runes naming all of the Seldarine gods and goddesses. Detailed engravings and a large emerald decorated its hilt.
It was a +4 bastard sword. When unsheathed, the sword offered protection from enemy weapons. It also functioned as a ring of spell storing.
Ytharra was said to have used Kanalruil to slay a great wolf that threatened to devour the sun.
