Oil of the pickpocket was a magical substance that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider and the bottom than they were at the top.
When applied to the hands, this oil allowed someone who lacked any thieving skills to pick pockets with the skill of a beginning thief. If used by a thief of any skill level, the oil would increase their pick pocketing skills.
Oil of the pickpocket lasted for 6 hours.
