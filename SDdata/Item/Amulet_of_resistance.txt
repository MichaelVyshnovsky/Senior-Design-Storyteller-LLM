Amulets of resistance were fairly common magical amulets worn around the neck that granted the wearer resistance to one element.
Amulets of resistance came in one of four types amulets of fire resistance, amulets of acid resistance, amulets of electrical resistance, and amulets of cold resistance. Each type granted the wearer a magic resistance to the corresponding element.
The amulets of resistance became a common commodity created by the Red Wizards of Thay under Druxus Rhyms lead. These amulets were relatively cheap to make and provided the Red Wizards enclaves across the realms with a significant source of profit.
