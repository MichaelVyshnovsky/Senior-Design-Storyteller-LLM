}}'''''Amulets of resistance''''' were fairly common magical [[amulet]]s worn around the neck that granted the wearer resistance to one element.

==Powers==
''Amulets of resistance'' came in one of four types: ''amulets of fire resistance'', ''amulets of acid resistance'', ''amulets of electrical resistance'', and ''amulets of cold resistance''. Each type granted the wearer a magic resistance to the corresponding element.

==History==
The ''amulets of resistance'' became a common commodity created by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] under [[Druxus Rhym]]'s lead. These amulets were relatively cheap to make and provided the Red Wizards' enclaves across the realms with a significant source of profit.
