        "mainbody": "Sunrods were a light source created either through alchemy or magic.\nSunrods were iron rods with golden tips, measuring roughly  in length and weighing . They were activated by striking them against another surface.\nThey casted a steadier light than torch light,&mdashtypically four to six hours&mdashand they were difficult to extinguish. Once a sunrods duration was over, its golden tip became dim and unusable.\nEmber moss was one of the few known items that could be used in the creation of sunrods.\n* Almaes the Alchemists shop in Ashabenford sold sunrods.\n* Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch, being a business run by an alchemist, sold sunrods.\n* Some miners were known to attach sunrods to helmets in order to provide them a hands-free source of illumination.\n* Sunrod chemicals could be incorporated into arrows, bolts, or sling bullets to craft what was known as signal ammunition.\n* Both gold dwarves and shield dwarves were commonly seen to carry sunrods.\n* Jak Fleet"
