        "mainbody": "Scarabs of death were deadly enchanted items that appeared harmless at first glance.\nScarabs of death appeared indistinguishable from mundane or magical amulets, brooches, or scarabs.\nIf a scarab of death was touching warm living flesh, placed in a bag or a similar container, worn on clothes, or simply kept within  from a warm living creature for between 1 and 10 minutes, the items enchantment became obvious. \nA scarab of death transformed into a deadly flesh-burrowing insect that chewed and tore through the targets leather armor, clothes, and body moving towards the heart. It took 1 to 10 minutes for the monster to reach the targets heart and kill them. After the targets death, a scarab of death transformed back into its inert form.\nScarabs of death could be safely kept in containers made of thick wood, ceramic, ivory, or metal.\nScarabs of death could be created by experienced magic item crafters with the use of the slay living spell.\nAragath, a lich priest of Talos who laired underneath Jathrins Jump guarded his underground temple with six golems. Each was outfitted with numerous magic items, including scarabs of death."
