        "mainbody": "The Shadowhisper was a unique enchanted black-hilted short sword that belonged to Rolga Stumprock‎ before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War.\nThe Shadowhisper possessed a powerful +5 enchantment and significantly increased the wielders protection from mundane and magical dangers. Additionally, the short sword allowed the wielder to cast invisibility at will and held four charges of the spell.\nFollowing Rolga Stumprock‎s death, the blade was interred along with its mistress within the deepest levels of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor. The series of interconnected dwarven tombs were protected by ancient constructs and magics that allowed people in need to claim the artifacts from the crypts if the appropriate donation was made."
