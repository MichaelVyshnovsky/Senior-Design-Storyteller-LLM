The '''''Helldusk armor''''' was a set of powerful [[enchanted]] [[plate mail]] forged by the forgemaster [[Carixim]] in [[Avernus]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
==Powers==
Wearers of the ''Helldusk armor'' received several powerful boons. Firstly, anyone could wear this plate mail as if they were trained in the armor use. When the wearer was targeted by a hostile [[spell]] and succeeded at avoiding full damage or shrugged its effects off, the ''infernal retribution'' enchantment set the spellcaster on fire, scorching them for eighteen seconds. Additionally, the ''prime aegis of fire'' enchantment made the wearer resistant to fire, both mundane and magical, lessened all fire damage received and made it impossible for them to be lit aflame. And lastly, it allowed the wearer to ''[[fly]]'' at will.
==History==
The ''Helldusk armor'' was forged in the [[Nine Hells]] by Carixim sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR and was created as a part of the set that included ''[[Helldusk helmet]]'', ''[[Helldusk gloves]]'', and ''[[Helldusk boots]].'' A [[flawed helldusk armor|lesser version]] of this plate mail could've been created by the [[tiefling]] smith [[Dammon]] formerly of [[Elturel]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The original set of ''Helldusk armor'' was worn by a [[cambion]] spawn of [[Mephistopheles]] â€“ [[Raphael]].
