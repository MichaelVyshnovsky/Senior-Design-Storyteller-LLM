'''Espruar''' ({{Pronounce|es|proo|AR|audio=Espruar.ogg|refs= and the script used to write the [[Elven language]].

==Description==
[[File:A_true_friend-5e.jpg|thumb|350px|''"A true friend<br />As the trees and the water<br />Are true friends."'']]
Espruar was a graceful and fluid script. It was also used as the writing system for the [[Dambrathan language]].

The script was also used by mortals when writing in [[Deep Speech]], the language of [[aberration]]s, as it had no native script of its own.

==History==
The Espruar script was originally developed by the moon elves, but had been subsequently adopted by [[sun elves]], [[drow]], and other elven peoples as their preferred script, remaining so for several millennia.

Around {{Yearlink|1357}} and by the late 15{{th}} century DR, most elves across [[Faerûn]] used it to render messages, either in [[Common]] or in their own language. The language was also used on [[Evermeet]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

By {{Yearlink|1372}}, a variant of the Espruar script was commonly in use, with characters that differed substantially from the ones in use in previous and subsequent decades.
