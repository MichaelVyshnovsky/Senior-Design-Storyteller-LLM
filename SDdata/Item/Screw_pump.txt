A '''screw-lift water pump''' was a simple but ingenious mechanical device used to pump water vertically.
{{Quote
|I wanted to have water on the second floor of my house. So I made this screw to bring water up for me.
|''[[Nadul DaRoni]], inventor''
}}

==Usage==
The pump lifted water by means of carrying it inside its screw-shaped chamber as it rotated.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a version devised by the mind of [[Nadul DaRoni]], valued at 75 [[gp]]. He reported that 30 turns of the crank brought up {{SI|5|gallon|long=yes}} of water, and noted its potential use in pumping hot [[oil]].

The concept of the screw pump was seemingly independently invented in multiple locations. This included the [[House of Gond]] in [[Essembra]], where such devices were put on display for the public, and the [[Steps of Istishia]] in [[Keltar]], where the pumps were used to supply water to the top of the enormous fountain structure.
