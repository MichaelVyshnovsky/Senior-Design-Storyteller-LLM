'''Sarsauce fowl''' was a baked poultry dish found in [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Sarsauce fowl was a daily-fare dish of sautéed [[mushroom]]s, various poultry meats, and [[cream]]. The dish was baked similarly to a casserole. [[Elminster]] considered sarsauce fowl one of his favorite foods found in the Realms, second only to fire-seared [[barbfin]] or [[smoked salmon]].
