A signal whistle was a mouth-operated device that made a high pitched noise in order to indicate a signal.
These whistles could be made out of many common materials, but some could be made of ivory. They were used by humans and other races, such as hobgoblins.
Signal whistles were used in some places throughout Toril, particularly in Faer√ªn, Zakhara,
* The guards of Jasuga would summon reinforcements via the use of the signal whistles they would keep on them, especially when the city walls were being scaled.
* The adventurer Balismo Dey Canna always kept a signal whistle on his person.
* The City Watch of Waterdeep as well as the guards of the Shoon Palace were known to use whistles to call reinforcement in case of trouble.
* The traffic wardens of Waterdeep used whistles and small colored flags to order drovers around.
*The Maces of Elversult used specific whistle codes that allowed them to communicate details about the nature of threats they faced.
* Cormyrean guardsmen were known to use dragon-headed whistles.
