A '''signal whistle''' was a mouth-operated device that made a high pitched noise in order to indicate a signal.

==Description==
These whistles could be made out of many common materials, but some could be made of [[ivory]]. They were used by [[human]]s and other races, such as [[hobgoblin]]s.

Signal whistles were used in some places throughout [[Toril]], particularly in [[Faer√ªn]], [[Zakhara]],

==Notable Owners==
* The guards of [[Jasuga]] would summon reinforcements via the use of the signal whistles they would keep on them, especially when the city walls were being scaled.

* The [[adventurer]] [[Balismo Dey Canna]] always kept a signal whistle on his person.

* The [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]] as well as the guards of the [[Shoon Palace]] were known to use whistles to call reinforcement in case of trouble.{{Cite adventurers league/A Wrinkle in the Weave|5}}
