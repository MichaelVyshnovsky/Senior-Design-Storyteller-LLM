It was decorated with a regal insignia.

==Powers==
The sword possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that enhanced its damage and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. Additionally, the ''Twilight Guardian'' granted the wielder significantly increased protection from magics and [[spell]]s cast by [[orc]]s and [[orog]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the ''Twilight Guardian'' was in the scaly hands of the [[lizardmen]] followers of the [[sorcerer]] named [[Malgi Hi]], who claimed a part of the ancient [[Dwarven Dungeons]] underneath Myth Drannor.
