'''''Zalantar spears''''' were [[enchanted]] [[polearm]]s crafted using the wood of the [[Zalantar]] [[tree]]s.

==Description==
The spears made of Zalantar were hard and light weapons, dark brown or almost black in color.

==Powers==
Zalantar wood seems to have magic flow through it, which made enchanting items carved out of it an easy and common task. ''Zalantar spears'' possessed an innate ''+1'' enchantment.

==History==
Due to versatility of Zalantar wood, these spears could be found throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], lightly enchanted ''Zalantar spears'' were used in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]], and could be found as far as the jungled of [[Samarach]].
