        "mainbody": "The '''''great wyrm gauntlets''''' were a pair of unique [[enchanted]] [[gauntlets]] created by a [[dragon disciple]] named [[Redshadow]] sometime before [[1374 DR]].",
        "Powers": "The ''great wyrm gauntlets'' possessed powerful ''+6'' enchantments that made every punch a deadly danger and guided the wearer's fists toward their desired target. Additionally, each punch blazed with the fire that burned the target. However, the gauntlets' magic came at a price of significantly reduced dexterity.",
        "History": "These legendary gauntlets were stitched together out of a [[great wyrm]]'s hide by a dragon disciple only known as Redshadow, many years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Some stories claimed that the dragon disciple was the great wyrm's child. Sages agreed that the fearsome battle between the two took place in the skies over the [[Dragonsfire Mountains]]. Redshadow wore the ''great wyrm gauntlets'' until her death, after which the magic items disappeared from history for a long while.\n\nIn of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the ''great wyrm gauntlets'' were sold by a [[drow]] merchant who did business in the [[Undergate]], [[Westgate]]'s unsavory underbelly."
