        "Description": "Elverquisst was ruby colored, \"distilled from sunshine and rare summer fruits.\" It was smooth but flecked with gold. It was generally stored in bottles made of transparent crystal, capable of absorbing light. Upon speaking a specific phrase in [[Elven language|Elvish]], the light gathered into thirteen distinct points that resembled the constellation [[Correlian]].\n\nThe rare fruits that were used in making elverquisst were [[orosk]]s and [[resmer]]s. As of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], these plants only grew in [[Evereska]] and a few other isolated valleys around [[Faer√ªn]].{{Cite dragon/267/The New Adventures of Volo: Onward!|81}}\n\nElverquisst was highly prized by elves, especially in autumn. A ritual was involved in drinking Elverquisst. The ritual involved a chant, pouring the liquid into a goblet, swirling it around, sharing it with others, and offering a ritual bow of the head in thanks.{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|25}}",
        "Availability": "The [[House of Good Spirits]] was one of the few places in [[Waterdeep]] where one could obtain elverquisst. It was also available in [[Elturel]]'s famous tavern [[A Pair of Black Antlers]], where it was the most expensive drink on offer.\n\nA private drinking establishment called [[Walking Out to Meet the Dragon]] in [[Mosstone]] of [[Tethyr]] served a wide variety of rare libations, including elverquisst.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century DR, a bottle of elverquisst belonged to the [[maedar]] winemaker [[Vorlon]] who ran the [[Morden Winery]], located in a valley outs the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] in [[the Vast]]."
