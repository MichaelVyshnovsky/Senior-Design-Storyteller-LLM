        "mainbody": "druid staff was a magical staff that enabled a druid to summon and control animals as well as cast a variety of spells.\nThe staff was made of oak and carved at the top to form the head of a wild animal, most often that of a boar, deer, eagle, or wolf.\nIn combat, the druid staff could be wielded as a +2 quarterstaff.\nAt the expense of two charges, the staff allowed the druid to summon animals of the same kind as represented by the carved portion. All such animals within 12 miles (19 kilometers) were summoned to the druids presence and compelled to follow his or her commands.\nAt the expense of one charge, the druid could exert control over any animal within sight.\nAlso at the cost of a single charge, the staff could be wielded as the python version of a staff of the serpent, with the normal caution that the death of the snake resulted in the destruction of the staff.\nWith the expenditure of two charges, the bearer of the staff was empowered with the ability to call lightning down from the heavens, heal wounds and cure diseases, dispel undesirable magical effects, cause plants to quickly grow to form a thick, entangling barrier, and to speak the language of the plants themselves.\nOnce a month (per spell), the druid was able to unleash the greater powers of the staff without expending any charges. These included the ability to conjure earth elementals, conjure fire elementals, summon a horde of insects, transmute rock to mud, and raise a wall of fire or a wall of thorns. Upon casting one of these greater spells, that particular power could not be employed again until the druid recharged the staff in a Moonwell during the night of a full moon.\n* Genna Moonsinger owned a druid staff with the head of a bear carved at the top.\n* Robyn Kendrick owned a more powerful version known as the Staff of the White Well."
