        "mainbody": "The '''''standing bear''''' was a magical chalice carved in the shape of a [[bear]]. It was one of the ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'', a collection of magical vessels created by the [[Han people]] of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.",
        "Powers": "Those who drank from it received the strength of a [[bear]] for three hours, but also developed a flushed appearance and an excitable mood.",
        "History": "As one of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', the ''standing bear''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo.\n\nFor many years, the ''standing bear'' was in the possession of the [[Yio Dufong]], a [[yakuza]] clan in [[T'o na'Chee]]. All the Yio Dufong would imbibe before a fight, and for this reason they were called the \"bears\". However, the ''standing bear'' was later stolen and by [[1357 DR]] had still not turned up.[[Category:Items from Northeast Kara-Tur]]"
