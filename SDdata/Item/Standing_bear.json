It was one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, a collection of magical vessels created by the Han people of Koryo in ancient times.\nThose who drank from it received the strength of a bear for three hours, but also developed a flushed appearance and an excitable mood.\nAs one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, the standing bears powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo.\nFor many years, the standing bear was in the possession of the Yio Dufong, a yakuza clan in To naChee. All the Yio Dufong would imbibe before a fight, and for this reason they were called the \"bears\". However, the standing bear was later stolen and by 1357 DR had still not turned up.CategoryItems from Northeast Kara-Tur"
