==Description==
There wands were made out of [[ironwood]] and topped with a small flaming globe.

These [[wand]]s could cast fireballs, with up to seven charges, before potentially crumbling to ash. The user could also use the wand to release more powerful balls of fire, but this would result in more charges being used up.

At dawn, two to seven charges (the maximum amount) would be replenished.
