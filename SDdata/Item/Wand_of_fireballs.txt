A wand of fireballs was a rare magical item, which was capable of shooting fireballs.
There wands were made out of ironwood and topped with a small flaming globe.
These wands could cast fireballs, with up to seven charges, before potentially crumbling to ash. The user could also use the wand to release more powerful balls of fire, but this would result in more charges being used up.
At dawn, two to seven charges (the maximum amount) would be replenished.
Wands of fireballs have been used for many centuries. Because of how common was study of arcane flames, it was has to pinpoint the exact origin of these enchanted items. Many sages believed that the modern refined wand of fire design came from the worshipers of Kossuth in the land of Thay.
The bridge of Womford was incinerated by such a wand.
