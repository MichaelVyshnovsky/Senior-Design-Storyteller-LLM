}}A '''wand of frost''' was a [[wand]] that could fire a variety of cold-based [[arcane]] [[spell]]s.

==Description==
''Wands of frosts'' expelled magical cold energy, in the form of ''[[ice storm]]s'', ''[[cone of cold|cones of cold]]'', and ''[[wall of ice|walls of ice]]''. The wands had limited charges, and would use up one per spell cast, except for when a ''cone of cold'' was cast, in which case they used up two charges. It was possible to recharge these wands.

[[Frost salamander]] bones could be used to form parts of ''wands of frost''.

Some variations of ''wands of frosts'' could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor. ''Wands of cone of cold'' (that were able to cast the ''[[cone of cold]]'' spell) and ''wands of cold'' (casting ''[[chill touch]]'') appeared to be unmelting enchanted icicles.
