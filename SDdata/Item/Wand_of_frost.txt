A wand of frost was a wand that could fire a variety of cold-based arcane spells.
Wands of frosts expelled magical cold energy, in the form of ice storms, cones of cold, and walls of ice. The wands had limited charges, and would use up one per spell cast, except for when a cone of cold was cast, in which case they used up two charges. It was possible to recharge these wands.
Frost salamander bones could be used to form parts of wands of frost.
Some variations of wands of frosts could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor. Wands of cone of cold (that were able to cast the cone of cold spell) and wands of cold (casting chill touch) appeared to be unmelting enchanted icicles.
