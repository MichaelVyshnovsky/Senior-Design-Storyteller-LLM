Onyx of the Richest Wort was an enchanted amulet that belonged to the dwarven brewmaster Durlin of Myth Drannor.
Onyx of the Richest Wort was a necklace made out of a huge uniquely-colored onyx stone. The gem itself had a hue similar to dark beer and was etched with protective magic runes.
Onyx of the Richest Wort was blessed by Durlins deity, Hanseath and possessed enchantments that improved the wearers constitution, luck, and resistance to various abilities and effects. The Onyx granted its owner a strong resistance to magic and spells and allowed them to cast the neutralize poison spell.
Onyx of the Richest Wort was a dwarven item from the glory days of Myth Drannor. During the citys last days, before its fall in the Weeping War, Durlin managed to hide his most precious enchanted items throughout the Dwarven Dungeons. The Onyx was hidden within one of the huge beer kegs on the Halls of Light level of the dwarven settlement.
In 1369 DR, Durlin in his undead ghost form, guided the heroes from Phlan, the Veiled Ones to his hidden treasures trying to aid them in breaking the Cult of the Dragons hold on the ruins and the  citys mythal.
