'''''Onyx of the Richest Wort''''' was an enchanted [[amulet]] that belonged to the [[dwarf|dwarven]] brewmaster [[Durlin]] of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Onyx of the Richest Wort'' was a necklace made out of a huge uniquely-colored [[onyx]] stone. The gem itself had a hue similar to dark [[beer]] and was etched with protective magic runes.

==Powers==
''Onyx of the Richest Wort'' was blessed by Durlin's deity, [[Hanseath]] and possessed enchantments that improved the wearer's constitution, luck, and resistance to various abilities and effects. The ''Onyx'' granted its owner a strong resistance to magic and spells and allowed them to cast the ''[[neutralize poison]]'' spell.

==History==
''Onyx of the Richest Wort'' was a dwarven item from the glory days of Myth Drannor. During the city's last days, before its fall in the [[Weeping War]], Durlin managed to hide his most precious enchanted items throughout the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. The ''Onyx'' was hidden within one of the huge beer kegs on the Halls of Light level of the dwarven settlement.

In [[1369 DR]], Durlin in his undead [[ghost]] form, guided the heroes from [[Phlan]], the [[Veiled Ones]] to his hidden treasures trying to aid them in breaking the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s hold on the ruins and the  city's ''[[mythal]]''.
