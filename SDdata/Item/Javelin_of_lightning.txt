A '''''javelin of lightning''''' was a [[magic]]al [[weapon]] that could be thrown.

==Description==
When the wielder threw it and spoke a [[command word]], the weapon transformed into a [[Lightning bolt|bolt of lightning]]. It could be thrown up to 120 feet (37 meters). Each creature in the path of the target was affected, unless they managed to dodge the bolt. The lightning bolt turned back into a [[javelin]] when striking the target, and delivered a high amount of lightning damage.

==Notable owners==
Several adventurers wielded such an item. The more well-known of them included:
* [[Thunderstorm]], a powerful [[human]] nomad.
* [[Vhazror]], an [[orc]] [[barbarian]].<ref>
* [[Raulothim]], an ancient [[emerald dragon]] who lived on the isle of [[Axard]].{{Cite dragon/253/Wyrms of the North: Raulothim|83}}
