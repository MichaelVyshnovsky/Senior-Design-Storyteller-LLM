        "Powers": "These staves allowed a wizard to use the following powers: ''[[cool strength]]'', ''[[depth warning]]'', ''[[converse with sea creatures]]'', ''[[water blast]]'', and ''[[waterbane]]''. Using these powers expended one charge.\n\nThe following powers expended two charges for regular wizards and only one charge for [[Elemental mage|sea mages]]: ''[[conjure water elemental]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', and ''[[command water spirits]]''.\n\nA sea mage wielding this staff could summon a ''[[maelstrom]]''. ''Maelstrom'' consumed four charges.\n\nSimply holding the staff granted the wielder the ''[[water breathing]]'' ability. This power did not consume a charge, but was only available as long as the staff had at least one charge remaining.",
