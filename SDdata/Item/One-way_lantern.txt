A '''one-way lantern''' was a magical [[lantern]] that projected a light only the bearer could see.

==Description==
It was small lantern fashioned of fine [[copper]], set with a dark [[ruby]] in its center.

==Powers==
The lantern appeared to project a kind of "one-way" light, visible only to those who grasped the handle and completely unseen by all others. For those who could see it, the lantern radiated bright light to a distance of 30 feet (9 meters), like a ''[[light]]'' spell. The light hampered the [[infravision]] of one who grasped, but not the infravision of others. Owing to the size of the lantern, only three [[human]]-sized creatures could try to hold the lantern at once.

==History==
The [[Halruaa]]n mage [[Daltim Flamefist]] came across a ''one-way lantern'' on an expedition in the 1360s [[DR]]. He wrote details of it in his [[spellbook]] ''[[Daltim's Tome of Fire]]'', which he lost in [[Tethyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]]. It was possible that more ''one-way lanterns'' might be traded in [[Faer√ªn]] or lost in old treasure hoards.

==Usage==
Daltim theorized that the ''one-way lantern'' had been fashioned for use by one or more [[human]]s in a group of [[elves]] or other creatures that possessed infravision. With the lantern in hand, they could see normally without projecting a light that would either spoil the infravision of their companions or revealing their position to others.
