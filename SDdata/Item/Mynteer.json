        "mainbody": "ynteer, also known as phenakite, was a hard, clear, and rare gemstone found in the Realms.\nThese semi-precious stones occurred in crystals, usually with inclusions so that it yielded only small faceted gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.\nThis stone was powdered and mixed to make magical ink to inscribe scrolls for casting spells related to the movement of objects via levitation, telekinesis, or magical force, such as unseen servant, Tensers floating disc, etc."
