'''Ashaba Dusk''' was a variety of red [[wine]], produced in [[Sembia]]. It was exported as far as the [[Western Heartlands]], the lands along the [[River Chionthar]], and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Named after the [[River Ashaba]] that crossed the [[Dalelands]] and Sembia, this red wine was somewhat flat in flavor, yet "charmingly plucky." The wine was sold in simple green glass unlabeled bottles.
