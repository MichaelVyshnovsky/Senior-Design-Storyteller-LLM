A '''''bell of warning''''' was a type of small magical [[bell]] from the land of [[Kara-Tur]] that could detect the presence of anyone approaching it covertly.{{ Cite book/Oriental Adventures|134}}

==Description==
These bells measured {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|4|in|long=yes}} in diameter.

==Powers==
Activating a ''bell of warning'' required hanging it, such as upon a branch or rafter, and then speaking its [[command word]] is spoken. Each activation used up a magical charge, with each bell having upwards of 30 charges, and lasted for around 3 to 18 hours.

While activate a ''bell of warning'' would ring whenever any creature came within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} from either the [[Astral plane]] or [[Ethereal plane]]. It likewise would sound from any creatures that were invisible or attempting to move stealthily or silently. This ringing would then persist until a ''bell of warning'' either deactivated or the detected presence moved outside of its effective radius.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Ayana No-Shui]], a powerful [[wu-jen]].<ref>
* The [[Horseshoe Temple Oasis|Horseshoe Temple]] in the [[Quoya Desert]] had a ''bell of warning'' amongst its collection of magical instruments. When the temple was later overran by [[oni]] in [[1358 DR]], it was amongst the items that survived.
* [[Lui-hsia Chih]], a leader of the [[Many-Hued Peacock Society]].

==History==
Around {{YearlinkConvert|2608|SY}} to early {{YearlinkConvert|2609|SY}}, a group of [[bakemono]] took up residence in the long abandoned [[Lihat Observatory]], believing it held unusual weaponry inside. As part of establishing defenses within the observatory, the bakemono placed  ''bell of warning'' in the anteroom to alert them of any intruders.<ref><ref group="note">No date is given for ''Ronin Challenge'', nor its companion adventure ''Test of the Samurai''. However, it includes Kara-Turan characters from ''[[Hall of Heroes]]'', which is dated to 1358 DR, and is set after the unfinished events detailed there. In particular, it seems at least "about a year" later for the Earth Spider. On the other hand, it includes characters featured in ''[[Dragonwall (novel)|Dragonwall]]'', which is dated to 1359/[[1360 DR]], which clearly occurs later for them. In particular, Ting Mei Wan was recently made a minister in ''Ronin Challenge'' and has been minister for two years by the time of ''Dragonwall''. These narrow the main events of ''Ronin Challenge'' to late 1358 DR or early 1359 DR.
