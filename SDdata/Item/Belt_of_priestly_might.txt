'''''Belts of priestly might''''' were defensive magical items, created by servants of a given [[deity]], that boosted the wearer's strength and natural defenses.{{cite book/Magic Item Compendium|74}} They were normally named for their faith of origin e.g. ''Mystran belt of priestly might''.

==Appearance==
''Belts of priestly might'' were made of broad leather, and featured a stamp of a [[deity]]'s [[holy symbol]] on the front.

==Creation==
To manufacture ''belts of priestly might'', an [[arcane spellcaster]] or [[divine magic|divine spellcaster]] had to know both ''[[barkskin]]'' and ''[[bull's strength]]''.

They were created by many different faiths, and could only be worn safely by persons who were either of that deity's [[alignment]], or had that deity as a patron.

==History==
The first ''belts of priestly might'' appeared in [[Halruaa]] at the end of the [[Time of Troubles|Godswar]]; the Halruaans took this as a sign that [[Midnight|Mystra]] had returned. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Sharran]] ''belts of priestly might'' were worn by the followers of the Lady of Loss.

==Variations==
*''[[Belt of priestly might and warding]]
*''[[Belt of holy might]]
