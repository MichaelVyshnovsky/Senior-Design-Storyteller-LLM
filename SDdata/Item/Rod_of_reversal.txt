Rods of reversal were magic rods that proved to be effective and highly sought-after items by spellcasters and those who hunted them.
Each rod held fifty charges and allowed its wielder to cast dispel magic  (three charges) and greater dispel magic (five charges). These wands were effective against friend and foe alike.
In the late 14 century DR, rods of reversal gained wide-spread popularity across the Sword Coast. These rods could be in stock of magic goods merchants in cities such as Neverwinter and Daggerfords Sorcellers Encapsulate.
