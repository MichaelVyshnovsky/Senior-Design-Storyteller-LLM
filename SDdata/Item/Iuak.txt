An iuak was a blade made of bone or stone that resembled a machete, common in the Great Glacier.
An iuak was about  long and  wide. It had a flat tip, and weighed about . In some lands, it could sell for as much as twelve gold pieces.
It was primarily used for carving snow blocks for snow houses, but it could also be used as a weapon. However, Iuaks tended to break if employed in combat by someone not skilled in their usage.
