An '''iuak''' was a blade made of bone or stone that resembled a machete, common in the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
An iuak was about {{SI|2|ft}} long and {{SI|6|ft}} wide. It had a flat tip, and weighed about {{SI|4|lbs.|k}}. In some lands, it could sell for as much as twelve [[gold pieces]].

==Usage==
It was primarily used for carving snow blocks for snow houses, but it could also be used as a weapon. However, Iuaks tended to break if employed in combat by someone not skilled in their usage.

==Notable Owners==
Nearly every [[Iulutiun]] hunter carried an iuak. The weapon was rare among the [[Nakulutiun]]s.

The great explorer [[Sharra Frohm]] carried an iuak as did the famous Iulutiun philosopher [[Inum]]. [[Najass]], a master Iulutiun hunter, fought with a custom-made, two-handed iuak made from [[tirichik]] bone.
